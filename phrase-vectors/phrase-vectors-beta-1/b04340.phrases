thrilled to be here
to be here
be here
not really
talk to them
are always consistent here

working at 5:30 pm
are both pokie too
write my review in line
's a subway
was bad enough
moved in slow motion
put on my sandwiches
yelled at them
reached over
poked them or something
preparing my food
Not really .
's just common sense

's a subway
Same ol' stuff

is a complete asshole
was n't cooked
was gooey all wet
refused to re-make the sandwiches
to re-make the sandwiches
re-make the sandwiches
's a real cheap bastard
to be in good spirits
be in good spirits
seeing who they work for
work for
paid me

asked him a question
was almost rude
fall apart upon unwrapping

is mike
worst leader ever
to be here
be here
's counting down
counting down
talking to customers
sat down and all
had white bread
