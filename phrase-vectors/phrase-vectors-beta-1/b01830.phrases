confiscated guns in the Nation
be a very chaotic environment
love the southside
's tension
's colorful characters
are beautiful to me
Open primarily for lunch
can remember
YES !
speak Chinese ?!
brightened up
shwah id-yar
talking about whatever
was being prepared
being prepared
to take out the tables
take out the tables
getting robbed on evening
robbed on evening
closing during the early evening
to wonder off into oblivion
wonder off into oblivion
was up
was gooooood !!
gooooood !!
was crispy and simply fried
was delish
boasted sprouts and a lil
char that Jackie requested
are good
was $ 10
to place their orders
place their orders
is special to my heart
be scary to venture into
to venture into
venture into
stay on the main roads
be a polite driver
should be alright
be alright
Go and pay the Wong
's a visit
Try the chicken wings
're GREAT

Nice little dive
has a crisp
burn taste
judge me

Love the food
