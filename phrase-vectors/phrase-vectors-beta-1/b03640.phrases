to buffer demand
buffer demand
walked around

'll admit
beat Sam 's Club

visiting this
Get the idea
's rarely crowded
run in grab 2-3 items
Try that at Costco

have been to Costco
been to Costco
is like a cheap knockoff

want have at times
have at times

had a Guess Card
came away reasonably impressed
rolled out by Walmart 's
thought it was their card
was their card
started shopping at Costco
is A-OK in our book
A-OK in our book
eyeballing things
found only in their store
looking for cheap and basic
have the advantage over Costco
has it 's own market
seems to be king
to be king
be king
having an edge
shop here every week
come once every three weeks
pickup specific items
's , but prefer Costco
prefer Costco
favor all those years ago
Enjoy !
