'm from Rack Room Shoes
sells the ugliest shoes around
shopping for a toddler
leaving Journeys Outlet
finding nothing
stop sipping that Fat Tuesday
sipping that Fat Tuesday
to check it out
check it out
was running out
running out
walked in and BAM
walked in
were having a BOGO sale
having a BOGO sale
were basically rushing us
rushing us
wanted for 1/2
ask for
love this city

shop for shoes
looking for an everyday shoe
will do the trick
do the trick
was a bust
like about this store
have your size

are on the left side
are on the right side
is just OK

had in a shoe store
was a bit cluttered
killed the visit for me
saw on hand
was actually doing her job
doing her job
talking with each other
'm already limited to less
fitting my foot
look like bug vomit
were my size
looked pretty decent
finding an employee
getting their assistance
to protect
to fall to the floor
fall to the floor
opted out of that option
to help me out
help me out
Completely avoiding all customers
chatting on the clock
becoming few and far between
jump in
need some help over here
rolls his eyes
wanted to try
to try
impressing me
being as crappy as possible
giving them my business
is for sure
step up their game
use and do that job
do it well
