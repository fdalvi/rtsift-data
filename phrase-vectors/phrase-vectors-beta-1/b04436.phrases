parking not bad


know they have good sandwiches
have good sandwiches
eat at this particular Subway
to go
had in my life
used old ingredients
tasting it
were going to get sick
going to get sick
to get sick
get sick
try anything from there again

walked in
then walked right out
was working
coughing and sniffing
snorting all over the food

like extra cheese 3 times
ended up with double meat
seemed distracted
got home
just crumbled into pieces
return to this subway again
