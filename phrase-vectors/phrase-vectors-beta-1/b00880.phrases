working in overdrive
simultaneously makes my brain bleed
reeking of over-ripe fruit
defined `` boosts
Drop the $ 5
get a smoothie from Jamba
means hello
means corporate health-craze capitalism

were perky
placed my order
thought , but cool
clean place with limited seating
was loud , though
were jammin ' with Jamba
jammin ' with Jamba

like Jamba Juice
turn the music down
's hurting my ears
hurting my ears
bit my tongue
anxiously awaited for my Orange-A-Peel
was good
Just loud .

thought into places like this
worked the register
was Maggie
were n't busy
complain about the smoothies there
think they 're good
're good
was incredible
Yummy yummy yummy !!

never get your order right
making the order
is right
are wrong
is typical of the place
likes to go in there
to go in there
go in there
'd never see me again
see me again
do n't get my AMEX
get my AMEX
can make then
make then
print out an itemized receipt
'd suggest it
suggest it
saying much is it
is it
proofing this place
want to be for long
to be for long
be for long
is wishful thinking
is an empty spot
can really become ugly
become ugly
can say for the place
say for the place
is they have good oatmeal
have good oatmeal
