cut for a good price

were in front of me
was the only one waiting
finished her hair cut
then left
get lunch
said sorry
get there before they closed
stuck it out
was still there
cutting my hair
got home
go back
have them fix it
fix it
tried to help
to help
made it worse
fixed it for me
mind wasting your day
wasting your day
give this place a shot
'll probably kill yourself
kill yourself

was walking towards the store
walking towards the store
had a hesitant look
want us to walk in
to walk in
walk in
have an eagles eye
saw their expression-totally unprofessional
leave high tips
to have class
have class
be approachable
