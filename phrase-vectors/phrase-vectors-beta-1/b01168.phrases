put in front of me
to be a little gooey
be a little gooey
overthrows governments and stuff
to grace the Arcadia hood
grace the Arcadia hood
can ring for good service
ring for good service
has it
are running out the door
running out the door

visit them
is up to standards
went through the drive through
took our order
was very friendly
took the order quickly
was tasty
were hot
had n't been sitting out
been sitting out
sitting out
cashed out
handed our food
were almost forgotten
almost forgotten
had to remind them
to remind them
remind them
bother me at all
is rare to see
to see

upgrade my drink size
want their gigantic curly fries
read the riot act today
spell it out for them
charged on your credit card
charged correctly on each item
like you Arby 's
'm not ringing that bell
ringing that bell
