'm here for work
is S. of town
is fine for us
is nice
is staying here tonight
staying here tonight

knew what luxury was
is yachts
is stretch limousines
throwing some glitter
making it rain
was I wrong
IS attainable
to love this fucking hotel
love this fucking hotel
entering the palatial lobby
had ever seen
was a nice touch
scoffed at
To think
tossed it
Let me tell you
tell you
curl up
sleep in there
was n't easy
sleeping in the mini-fridge
staring me in the face
kick them all out
is mean
could n't pee in there
pee in there
held it
was so luxurious
HAD to pee in it
to pee in it
pee in it
uses these same soaps
was done drying my hands
done drying my hands
drying my hands
even wash it off
known the Country Inn
was so luxurious
taste that royal tang again
cherish it
know I sure did

stayed here
was a nice hotel
Seemed clean
taken care of
were comfortable
passed through

is one
are nearly empty
to resent all your customers
resent all your customers
