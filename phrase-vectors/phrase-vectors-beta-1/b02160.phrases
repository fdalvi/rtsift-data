to be thrown out
be thrown out
thrown out
's done perfectly

avoid this location

Traveling through Phoenix
to eat
witnessed the not-well-thought-out merging process
merging process
to merge into that line
merge into that line
was dry and tasteless
were petrified
saves them
is convenient to the freeway
'll just keep going
keep going

know you love it
love it
smile for a dollar
are similar establishments

hate two lane drive thru
live in the area
go out of order
to acknowledge my lane
acknowledge my lane
sat waiting
procedure inside
asked today
