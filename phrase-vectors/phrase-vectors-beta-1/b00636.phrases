to see
needs a thorough cleaning
was totally off-putting for me

ordered something with traditional flare
has closed
came here were great
were great
loved the menu
loved the bitchy waitresses
loved the tacky seating
was a sweet-ass place

grow up with you
did grow bigger with you
grow bigger with you
'll be missed
be missed

become a second Postino location
