always makes me sick
ordering anything there
making a sandwich at home

is still in Biz
is a rotation of kids

Lines out out the door
have new owners or managers
be a good thing
was counting black olives
counting black olives
Stingy with the meat
get the sweet onion chicken
are fine
like subway

run this place
is lame

do n't LIKE Subway
LIKE Subway
do n't mind it
mind it
makes me mind it
mind it
acknowledges I 'm there
'm there
are n't paying attention
paying attention
cut it on a 6-inch
do n't put one star
put one star
might recognize me
recognize me
please load on those veggies
's Scottsdale
will tip you
tip you

turned it around
New management ?
is usually pretty quick
is friendly and efficient
is still Subway
is my lunchtime staple

to do their job
do their job
