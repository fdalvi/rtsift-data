have to go to Starbucks
to go to Starbucks
go to Starbucks
pisses me off the least
working at this location
have their shit together
is hardly ever even burned
ever even burned
is sweet as daisies
is generally quiet
to work on my crosswords
work on my crosswords

is my neighborhood Starbucks
face it
looking for consistency and efficiency
get it here
stretches to the door
're `` corporate
and my drink
do n't remember theirs
remember theirs
get to the register
's been a while
been a while
remember my drink
is out

go in there
'm stepping in to Cheers
stepping in to Cheers
Tip them well

've ever been too

work there
are always good

to be sure
be sure
is fine
seems to be lacking
to be lacking

is make a break
make a break
making the grade today

's a nice Starbucks
had a bad experience

has ZERO sense of urgency
drives me crazy
wait in a long line
cross your fingers
to get a coffee
get a coffee
waiting in line
Wake up Starbucks
get going

are not created equal
created equal
is good
was good

Love it here

was quick
was perfection

are so genuine
are all about
In a rush ?

have a tiny patio area
raining for once in phoenix
was packed
know I 'm repeating myself
'm repeating myself
repeating myself
comes to slow baristas
to slow baristas
slow baristas

is always good
is always clean
