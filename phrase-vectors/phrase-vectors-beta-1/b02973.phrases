love abercrombie shirts and jackets
smells good in there

is clean
are always nice and pleasant
comes to the dressing room
's terrible
beg to try on clothes
to try on clothes
try on clothes
is almost never there
walking in and out
is tacky in my opinion
taking off the security tags
dropped my clothes
walked away

to write
are n't my style
's sorta young kid chic
would look ridiculous on me
look ridiculous on me
to have more to offer
have more to offer
to offer
do n't seem to mind
seem to mind
to mind
going back on the left
think it 's pricey
's pricey
are `` distressed ''
was a kid
have holes and tatter then
have holes
tatter then
do n't have such
have such

hate the staff
'm sorry
come here
came home with 4
seen a check before
flubbing and absolutely ignoring anything
absolutely ignoring anything
rang it up
hate having to go back
having to go back
to go back
go back
