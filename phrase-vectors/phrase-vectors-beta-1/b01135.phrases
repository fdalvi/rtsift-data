finding this little gem
to pick up my order
pick up my order
was ready except the jacket
looks new again

actually follows your directions
spend $ 25
's a good deal
go up the block
grab a treat at LGO

to fix a disaster
fix a disaster
covered in green candle wax
say it was white again
was white again
are all so thankful !!!!
saved the day

ripped me off
'm still upset about it
upset about it
hauling it to the laundromat
pick it up after work
hands it over to me
gets home
is not our comforter
'd given to my husband
given to my husband
just came from goodwill
looked and felt very cheap
felt very cheap
to lie on
lie on
called Arcadia cleaners right away
was my comforter
tagged immediately when dropped off
dropped off
matched my receipt
are security cameras
come look at the tapes
went the following day
had been given
been given
had dropped off
dropped off
'd dropped off
dropped off
was a down comforter
've been a clerical error
been a clerical error
showed me the security tape
shows my comforter being tagged
being tagged
carted off
know how they did it
did it
sent home with my husband
boycotting the place
was the owner
was a total jerk
Totally full of himself .
is cozy
dealing with stuff like this
Shame on Arcadia cleaners

to get cleaned
get cleaned
was almost brown
was brittle and dingy
was yellow
meeting with the owner Mark
picked this up last week
is amazing
restored to its former glory
to thank for that
thank for that
