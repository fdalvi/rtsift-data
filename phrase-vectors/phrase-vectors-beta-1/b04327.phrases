involve throwing drugs at me
throwing drugs at me

thrilled with his action plan
was n't an instant cure
feel better than ever
'm not overmedicated
make me laugh
's abrupt
's a little off
get offended super easily
deal with political incorrectness

listen to you whine
throw you some painkillers
come back in a month
to tell you
tell you
do n't be a moron

eat all your trigger foods
not get migraines
want to shoot the messenger
to shoot the messenger
shoot the messenger
want to feel better

avoid any hard answers
hurt feelings
go elsewhere

've seen Dr. Epstein twice
seen Dr. Epstein twice
showed lesions on my brain
looked over my MRI records

had my spinal tap done
was for the results

need help
expect to communicate with anyone
to communicate with anyone
