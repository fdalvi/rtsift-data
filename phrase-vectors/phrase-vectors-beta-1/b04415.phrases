having been at Maries
been at Maries
had there over the years
's really great service
's just not
is equally hit or miss
is equally hit
than cornbread
'm complaining
:-RRB- This most recent visit
included with our dinner
to try
was there
was basic and nothing special
was good
was basic
's unpretentious

's ... where to begin
to begin
Stopped by for nostalgic reasons
used to take me regularly
to take me regularly
take me regularly
forgiving in certain aspects
might add
did n't go unnoticed
go unnoticed
was also very nice
's my issue - food
was okaaaayyy
should have been
have been
expected palatable
was neither
touched it
Fishy and rubbery
dismissed my complaint
hate making a scene
making a scene
did n't press the issue
press the issue
stayed untouched
ordered it
did n't like
eat because of poor quality
be writing this at all
writing this at all

to celebrate our wedding anniversary
celebrate our wedding anniversary
see it still in business
was all still there
remember exactly what is was
is was
was mine
are known for pies
known for pies
vowed never to return
to return
can not justify these prices
justify these prices
