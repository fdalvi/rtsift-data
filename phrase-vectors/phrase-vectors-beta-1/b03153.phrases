is friendly

shop somewhere else

's Safeway
is typical of Safeway
use their smart phone app

like the pharmacists there
need on my grocery list
to check out
check out
is usually atrocious
look up at you
do acknowledge you
acknowledge you
slicing their meat
mixing their salads
waiting on the customers
be very friendly and helpful
have about cooking fish
like the family friendly store
like getting discounts on gas
getting discounts on gas

's still a dump
are never friendly
's never enough of them
exit the store fast
go there for specific things
get out

is THE WORST
are always super long
super long
to cover the customers shopping
cover the customers shopping
are rude/inappropriate
checking out once
turned to me
like Obama
is not an appropriate question
shop here
is more convenient
regret my decision every time
learns to talk and write
to talk and write
talk and write

disappointed in this specific Safeway
took forever
needed and called someone up
called someone up
came to `` help ''
to `` help ''
`` help ''
was completely RUDE
talked to her
help me with my return
was only 1 line open
to get through
get through
would not recommend shopping there
