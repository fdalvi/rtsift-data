keeps me full all day
is friendly and fast
eat , sit and visit
wait for your meal
've got some time
got some time
Try it

is clean
Why ?
ca n't
owns and runs it
cooks your way-too-overpriced food
's rude
work in the building
is pricey
's really not that good
'm there
ca n't eat it
eat it
paying cash every time
see zingers I want
's cooking
finishes my burrito
puts it in a bag

steal from her
jip her
is always empty
consider it a miracle
's not just me
'm always polite
say please and thank
please and thank
stand this woman at all
to say
consider Burger King beneath them
says a lot
read below
are always busy
get in and out fast
sitting by the register
has n't had those before

indicate any sort of price
assuming they were free
were free
took a single one
ate it
to cough up a quarter
cough up a quarter
's no sign
has these out for everyone
'' No

had to have her quarter
to have her quarter
have her quarter
counted every single last penny
want to miss a penny
to miss a penny
miss a penny
am after writing this review
writing this review
do n't care
ever eating there again
be that desperate again
'd rather not eat first
eat first
want something super quick nearby
wrapped up
count every cent
stare at customers
treat every patron with suspicion
grab something quick
coming in

thumbs up
getting underway
