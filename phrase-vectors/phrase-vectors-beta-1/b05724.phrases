to be in Vegas
be in Vegas
been too
Walk in
's for you

hate going into this store
going into this store
are cheap
are RUDE
ignore you the entire time
try to ask a question
to ask a question
ask a question
pay for
wear them the second time

granted I
was a mess
tossed everywhere
get a couple of pairs
to look through the store
look through the store
gave up
spend my $ $ there
Next !
