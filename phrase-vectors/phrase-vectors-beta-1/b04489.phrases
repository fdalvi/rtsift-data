have the biscuts like Hardees

got my friends
had digestive problems
gone there before without incident
is cooked enough
cooked enough
to be safe
be safe

are legit
giving me stale ice tea
came out fresh and fast
was correct

threw service
are always out of food
feels like forever
to go back to get
go back to get
to get
making it new
talk to the manager
did n't even care just
care just
said `` ok ''
