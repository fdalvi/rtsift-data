to rummage through
rummage through
's to vintage furniture
is a bit frightening
run down
not just looking to buy
to buy
did n't already have plans
have plans
wait to go back
to go back
go back
are in Vegas

be the -LRB- now defunct
to tchotchkes to clothes
tchotchkes to clothes
can imagine
may be limited
be limited
is sometimes worth
's definitely OK to try
to try
have a blast

love Red Rooster Antique Mall
took their tiki section out
went this past Sunday
bothers me
enter off of Charleston
is so much stuff
like it

owns the Red Rooster
is moving to Illinois
moving to Illinois
runs the place
was very friendly
to have been picked over
have been picked over
been picked over
picked over
has passed
Go there instead

sold me a 6ft Marlin
thumbs up
is not lost on me
lost on me
gotten from a Florida transplant
to find it
find it
is open
display well
leads me to two
can imagine
are really designers in disguise
are great to work with
to work with
work with
is always fun
has passed thru here
passed thru here
thru here
is a fun spot
do n't buy
have n't seen before
seen before
be in by a mile
get a meager two stars
would be nice
be nice
hit the middle aisles first
tend to be best
to be best
be best
