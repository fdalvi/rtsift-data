was a Filibertos years ago
ago . .

lets face it
face it
are pretty much the same

want to wear your food
to wear your food
wear your food
be better than eating it
eating it

damned good
are a TON of ''
and ''
wont be disappointed
be disappointed
ruins them
get extra fatty/greasy

to eat
was a bit slow
was excellent
were tasty
was very crisp and fresh

By Default , the ''
and ''
are two star operations
relaxed than most
are four star for you
stray off the trusted path
count on good rolled tacos
serviceable bean burritos
delve into the numbered combos
regret it everytime
is pretty close to foul
seem very canned and oversoaked
can win you over
win you over
earned in that regard

had lunch today at Federicos
loves their Fish burritos
are huge
live in scottsdale
have good green chile
taste a little different !!
is very clean also !!
good prices !

looking for a good burrito
wont find it here
find it here
do n't believe the hype
believe the hype

was starving
give this place a try
was a HUGE mistake
to go
only swimming in fatty oil
was drowning in it
drowning in it
laid atop my food
blotting it with napkins
was no use
put that in my body
was just not worth it

far my favorite .
regularly :-RRB-

was in nacho heaven
know it
helping with my nacho fix
stop in
say hi . .
hi . .
grab some more nachos

always hits the spot
Great lunch as well .

had '' most likely
burritos in the word
was above average
was a little cold
could effect the rating
effect the rating
to give it five stars
give it five stars

will return soon
return soon

made hot sauce is amazing
is amazing
wo n't be disappointed
be disappointed

being a 24 hour
thru its darn good
could n't finish it
finish it

drank and partied all night
partied all night
is the cure for all
soak up all the alcohol
forget to get extra salsa
to get extra salsa
get extra salsa
