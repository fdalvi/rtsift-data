visiting this chain restaurant
went in with eyes
had to offer

walk in to your business
am gone
be clean
clean floors but disgusting bathrooms
must welcome you
welcome you
at least acknowledge your presence
being offered
walked in
took a look around
call a BBQ battle station
based sauce
like the BBQ sauce
handed out at BBQ places
comes with your meal
tasted OK
used over powered the meat
powered the meat
made the bread soggy
to be found

was added either way yuck

lacked in flavor
was almost mushy
being overpowered with it

enhance already well prepared meat
have made the food better
