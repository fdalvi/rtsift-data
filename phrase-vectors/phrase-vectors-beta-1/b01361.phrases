spread off to your liking

was fine
Easy to find location .
to find location
find location

love Einstein
are the bomb

to start your order
start your order
's also a little cramped
facing Papa John
's across the street

losing the taste

have always loved their bagels
loved their bagels

Went to one place

Love their seasonal food too

looking for breakfast around 8am
were prompt and very polite
had at an Einstein 's
was walking out
walking out
refilled all of coffee options
see attentive service like that

is local to our house
is always clean
is usually fast


was especially remarkable today
sat outside
brought my lunch out
did not bring a fork
bring a fork
to get my own fork
get my own fork
'm sure of that
was at 2:30 on 11/2/13

hated the long wait
ordering just
taking orders
taking payment
get through the line faster
has been claimed
been claimed
is even worse
is on the menu
is just regular Turkey Lunchmeat
ask for Turkey Lunchmeat
ask for Breakfast Turkey
's free of charge
be a difference in portions
's added to both sides
added to both sides
will just slide out
slide out
gets messy as funk
