was piqued
's Friday evening
pm we were told
were told
excitedly walked in
were sweeping up
sweeping up
did n't look promising
look promising
order to go now
to go now
go now
going to say no
to say no
say no
headed out
was sitting in consomme
sitting in consomme
were each wrapped separately
wrapped separately
was good
was crispy at some points
was a bit messy
was a good meal
brought it home
-RRB- I
had a website
realized Birrieria Jalisco was actually
was actually
was unique on its own
'm not so sure

is pretty tasty
do one thing
do it pretty well
the only starch
accompany your meal
give them

wo n't be big fans
be big fans
heading in
roasting or stewing the meat
had overdosed on meat afterwards
overdosed on meat afterwards
loved every bite

Aww damn , its closed
RIP !
