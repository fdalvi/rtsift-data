to eat

are so good after midnight
'm dying of hunger
dying of hunger

are delicious
rival some of the ones
had from real Mexican places
wrapped in a pita

offers fries on their menu
updated their decor a bit
fit with the times now
is good and quick
is always hot and satisfying
love thee

is wiped down very nice
wiped down very nice
pick up in every other
was well made
well made
looked fresh
looked like the freggin picture

stingy with the ingredients
fall down
wandering around the place
snarling at life in general
working there
and floor-mopping staffer
make a note
're mopping the dining area
mopping the dining area
are actually sitting and eating
sitting and eating
scoot out of here
make your minimum-wage life miserable
's always on my radar

`` CLEANING '' the frier
told me and still.cleanjng
told me
Bad experience . .
Very lazy workers .
Would n't go there again
Would n't go there again
go there again
