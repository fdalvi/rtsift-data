go out the window
satiate my primal desire sometimes
to admit it
admit it
wanted hot dogs today
With runny salty chili .
With cheese .
Too bourgeouisie and yuppie .
Pork lips and filler
increasing its exclusivity and appeal
WTF ?
Thank you Wienerschnitzel
thank you Rolaids

ordered a hot dog
to review a hot dog
review a hot dog
see there was a bun
was a bun
was n't soggy
was ok
ate it
'd go back
go back

been my weakness since childhood
visit often
lived on the east coast
's not that bad
is delicious
thinks you 're still down-to-earth
're still down-to-earth
come down
still allow the blood through
do n't worry
break in your immune system

to say about this restaurant
say about this restaurant
am not kidding
MAKE THE PAIN STOP
eating here
prayed for death

Costcos better

had the polish dog
am sorry

think twice
been here about five times
usually get the chili dogs
kick my ass later on

Heads up . .

to hit up Wienerschnitzel
hit up Wienerschnitzel

dwell on the fact
have a breaded meat
given that their name
take that into account
was my fist visit
was small inside
was friendly
seemed good
like the food very much
could find that

had an unpleasant after-taste
coming and going
