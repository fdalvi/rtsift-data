'm reviewing a McDonald 's
reviewing a McDonald 's
had to happen
to happen
say more than several times
is always ... uneventful
's just
was their big breakfast
was only McDonald 's good
tasted good that day
was my tummy that morning
either get my item solo
'd give it a shot
give it a shot
to scrape it all off
scrape it all off
tried it black
was a SMALL cup
could barely taste any sweetness
taste any sweetness
is totally sad
adding each condiment
wanted it to be better
to be better
be better
waiting for that magic ingredient
did n't come
looks much more reasonable

was a little bit special
charging me for it
did n't order a drink
order a drink
get her name next time
'm very likely to return
to return

disappointed one too many times
going through the drive-thru
take a test
failed it
Do yourself a favor

has a funny taste
would be fixed
be fixed

to say
point out the cool interior

is outstanding or severely lacking
severely lacking
falls in the latter category
to access from the street
access from the street
has sufficient parking
were in
was ready quickly
was calling out order numbers
calling out order numbers
was friendly
received everything I ordered
get for you
could get a word out
get a word out
had her attention again
ordered my meal
took my receipt
is fair for this visit

is nothing else
eating there every year
was just tired
to eat
went through the drive through
got my bag
was no ketchup
ask if I wanted any
wanted any
was typical
was n't worth the calories
peeved to be without ketchup
to be without ketchup
be without ketchup

must not be fast anymore
be fast anymore
drove up
said hello
received my food
turned around and walked away
turned around
walked away
have n't gone to McDonald
gone to McDonald
's in years
