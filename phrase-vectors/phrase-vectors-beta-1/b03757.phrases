doing nothing
enforces the bylaws
patrol our neighborhood for violations
collecting HOA fees

are at Amcor
is both unfriendly & unprofessional

is understandable
fixed the issue
to communicate that to them
communicate that to them
is absolutely unacceptable
save yourself the headache
look else where
