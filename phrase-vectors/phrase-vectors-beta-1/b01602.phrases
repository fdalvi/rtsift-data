was the price
was close to 4 bucks
is still expensive
go to Jamba Juice
want all natural
go to Smoothie King

heart you
make me a happy camper
prefer Smoothie King if possible
is a bit pricey
like and Juice It Up
Juice It Up
is more creamy
is more about the fruit
's particularly refreshing
has been great

had n't eaten all day
eaten all day
have no idea
was only a small dollop
was n't awful
to ever want to return
ever want to return
to return
stick with One Stop Nutrition
to double check their prices

taste the quality

treated rude by the staff
enjoy sub par smoothies then
is the place for you
love smoothies
been to a Smoothie King
to give it a try
give it a try
entered the store
making smoothies towards the back
to decipher
know what end is up
is up
is in these smoothies
have the smoothie ingredients explained
was considering
was `` ARE YOU KIDDING
ARE YOU KIDDING
have electrolytes in your body
was average at best
deserves only one star

give them 5 stars

addressing them to her
turned out super yummy

working here
wanted to purchase a smoothie

Very unfriendly !

love this place
being healthy unlike Jamba Juice
making suggestions
explaining their supplement/protein options
comes with protein in it
was delicious
'm in town for sure

turned off the open sign
locked the door
would change his mind
change his mind
to avoid eye contact
avoid eye contact
simply acknowledged us
're closed

understand wanting to go home
wanting to go home
to go home
