Next day ?
Keep dreaming
taken your garments
handed you a ticket
turned into Wednesday or Thursday
kill for only minor savings

satisfied me completely thus far
had ordered
white of course ...
managed to send it
to send it
send it
took care of me
are good
offer same-day service
use them exclusively

fit me
completed the job very quickly
were ready Tuesday
is amazing
pressed the pants as well

put out by my business
warned me
failed to greet me
to greet me
greet me
want to count the items
to count the items
count the items
spoke volumes -LRB- TOUGH -RRB-
going elsewhere in the future

ruin completely
to take responsibility for damage
take responsibility for damage
ignoring and not returning calls
returning calls

taking shirts to the laundry
being extra large
moved to the area
tryed this cleaner
stating $ 1.89 per shirt
was charged
asked about the price
was for extra large shirts
came back in
going to file a complaint
to file a complaint
file a complaint
was the owner
handed me his business card
walked away
to be cleaned
be cleaned

was wonderful
were done to perfection
done to perfection
was excellent
were good
did have next day service
have next day service
were the good old days
kiss my behind attitude
are not a couture cleaners
know where you end up
end up
