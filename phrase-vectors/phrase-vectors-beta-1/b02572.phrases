remember Kay 's Place
bars I 've ever entered
've ever entered
might die tonight
die tonight
resembles a scrap metal yard
LOVED dive bars
were dirt cheap
'm not kidding
can in one
being there
want to experience again
to experience again
experience again

was still hopping
sat down
did not make eye contact
make eye contact
walking in there
to mind or pay attention
mind or pay attention
be about half the crowd
rounded out by mexican
included on old biker dude
's or so
was relaxed
played on the jukebox
was indeed pretty divey
manufactured anymore
strung about here
string O ' promotional flags
been spraypainted christmas tree green
spraypainted christmas tree green
howling at the moon
Truly an enchanting sight .
break out at any second
to make any small talk
make any small talk
Headed out the door
was that

like ` Dive Bars '
said it
kinda like this local dive
are cheap
are very interesting
was fast

Impressed for a Dive Bar
stopped in
like karaoke
did a great job

visited before
have been recently renovated
been recently renovated
recently renovated
is now consistently clean
means no standing menu
getting food delivered or in-house
