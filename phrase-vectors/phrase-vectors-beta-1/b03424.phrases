altering confession here
Ready ?
Seriously .
looked at dog beds
were famished
sounded good
is pretty average
had chicken marsala

joined us
going for the happy hour
priced appetizers
settle for full priced dinner
'm not a polenta fan
to write home about
write home about
was okay
was rather good
will rush back for
rush back for
Promenade and want good food
is always a sure thing

not as corporate as Starbucks
came on regular plate
order it as a main
is vongole with linguine

Modern Italian cuisine and decor
to decide what to order
decide what to order
to order
made a great suggestion
was very sweet
to catch up in
catch up in
liked this place

've been there twice now
been there twice now
had excellent service
liked their dish
to be happy about
be happy about
was great
was great as well
are paying on the meal
paying on the meal
be going back more often
going back more often
Once a week .
