to say about this community

growing in the carpet
lasted months
could tear the walls
tear the walls
get to the black mold
was always an issue there
was horrendous
worked from home
mingled with folks
hung out
stalking me in the complex
keying it up
then carving in curse words
called the cops twice
do nothing about it
to park in
park in
park in the other complex
to stay away from here
stay away from here
is HORRIBLE
should be classy
be classy
pay for damages
asking the warden for leniency
to be away from there
be away from there
feel safe finally
well attended to

have a place to play
to play
keep an eye on them
to live
facing the preserve
