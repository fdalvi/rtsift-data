Love the Blizards !
ordered her chocolate Sunday
wanted whip cream on it
said yes
paid my husband
said surely not
given to those customers
could n't read it upsidown
read it upsidown
asked the guy
said , `` Oh
was an extra .35 cents
's just .35 cents
does aggrivate me
aggrivate me
asked a `` Kid
are 1.00 each
be on a Sunday anyway
costabout .79 cents a can
ask for whip cream

coming back here again
was 16 dollars
got overdrawn
even get an apology
come here all the time
lost my business for good

comes with your meal
is ridiculous
strip dry
are rude

has such bad reviews
've been to this location
been to this location
work there have been great
have been great
been great
know why or how
