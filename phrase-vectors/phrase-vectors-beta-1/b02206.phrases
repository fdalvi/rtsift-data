went to this restaurant yesterday
paid two meals with drinks
arrived at the salad bar
smeared on the serving tray
dug through the whole pile
find a single clean one
then looked at the plates
were ALL greasy
had food on them
picking them up
called for the manager
demanded my money back immediately
saw this happening
remove all the dishes immediately
contaminated in the same manner
got sick
let me know

to keep things interesting
keep things interesting
-RRB- My favorite soup today
was the Chicken Tetrazzini

had two bowls of it
to appreciate it
appreciate it
were fresh and tasty
could n't finish them
finish them
did n't taste it

went back for some

was a bargain

see if they needed anything

went ahead and went
went ahead
realize we had n't paid
had n't paid
's not my style
to pay

balanced off the negative
reading an earlier review
