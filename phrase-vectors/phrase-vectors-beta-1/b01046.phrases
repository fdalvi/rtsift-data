probably closed this place down
's fo ' sho

to come
bordered on the reckless
become a thing of legend
could find
to be found here
be found here
found here
Onward their travels
were sung
were broken microphones were dropped
broken microphones were dropped
were dropped
rivaled the marlboro man
is unmatched
dragged on
became more desperate
to be wavering
be wavering
to be in
be in
want of funds
said my goodbyes
wandered into the night whence
'd came

're too much work
was my hero
seen a man so happy
has figured out
figured out
is about
is quick to show you
to show you
show you
will listen
leaves the rest alone
poured a mean Guiness
ca n't think of one
think of one
was great
went on she
warmed up to us
leave at closing time
had a great time
will likely be back
be back
