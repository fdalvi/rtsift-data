can make it before noon
make it before noon
can avoid a long line
avoid a long line
say the sandwich was good
was good
beat the crowd
was large
was long
to cool the place down
cool the place down
was hot and muggy
is big
like fresh brewed tea
find it not fresh
'll go back
go back
wait until the weather cools
start chillin '
working in Quizno 's attire
do it on the sly
Nice guy , though
