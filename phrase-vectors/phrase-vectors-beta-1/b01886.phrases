is fledgling
made an Ignatian Retreat yet
to make your retreat
make your retreat

to attend a traditional mass
attend a traditional mass

is truly a traditional church
Very traditional .
was walking into
walking into
did not feel welcome
feel welcome
's okay
seeking a very traditional service

to run things
run things
to attend Mass here
attend Mass here
are on dangerous ground indeed
offering the Missal of 1962
does bear repeating
Do yourself a favor
