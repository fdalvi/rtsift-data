Not too shabby .
to catch a late show
catch a late show
roaming around

looking to watch a movie
to watch a movie
watch a movie
're looking to eat out
looking to eat out
to eat out
eat out
looking for a sugary treat
're looking to spend money
looking to spend money
to spend money
spend money
gives you options
like it
go every weekend
mind you
is certainly a-okay
park across at the Biltmore
use the underground passage
's a short trek
is nice
to go
's a great date spot
hands woman flower
walk toward Houston 's
's a date
happened at the Esplanade

is nice enough
only 2 stars
goes to die
to die
can escape the smell though
escape the smell though
walk her to her car
swimming in a septic tank
stinks like this as well
comes from

are kind of behind everything
is such a pain
looked nice
walking through the shops
to see
is upstairs
to take you up
take you up
was broken
to save money
save money
to fix it
fix it
had rained
was still 95? outside
was not fun

love this area
's a hidden gem
