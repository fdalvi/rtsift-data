Absolutely awesome and historic venue
is absolutely astounding
can imagine
to be a porn theater
be a porn theater
is part of the charm

seeing shows at the Barrymore
dining at Monty 's
would be a five-star review
be a five-star review
is awful
view your cart from there
make mistakes

is a great mid-size venue
to stand up front
stand up front
to top it all off
top it all off
can be a little tricky
be a little tricky
going a few times
learn the side streets
've seen here
seen here
fell off the stage

place for live music

seen a couple shows here
bar selections
get a good diverse crowd

is small
is cozy
has lots of charm
to get crowded very quickly
get crowded very quickly
assigned seating for the shows
so definitely show up early
to get the best seats
get the best seats
are with a large group
is not the best
is your best option

love the Barrymore
dig the vibe
's a fact
laid back it is
work there
comes in
just plain like it

to watch a live show
watch a live show
may have been wrong
have been wrong
been wrong
was good enough
was just meh
begin with the parking situation
is no parking situation
found something
found it
is really small
got there
to hit up a bar
hit up a bar
escapes me now
cash only
looked so old
said however
was not any better
took cash
takes cash
vow to myself not return

packed for the GA shows
get there early enough
find the seating you want
to see a show
see a show
had to walk a little
to walk a little
walk a little
creates a lot of ambiance
is an older theater
is fantastic , too

love about this place
just moving from Chicago
can be
are several good restaurants/bars around

love this place
is right on the stage
is great
hang at before the show
to come back
come back

is a pit
are cramped and uncomfortable
is small
want to groove
to groove
throw people out
end up in the balcony
give it up
go home
is in perpetual decline
to fix it up
fix it up
pool their resources
work on that
to attend an event
attend an event
What ?
builds character
is just stupid

stepped up their game
keeping up with its contemporaries
is near-archaic
to sell out
sell out
's just my personal taste
offend my own political views
're often dull
want their beliefs perpetually reaffirmed
sell more tickets that way
blame them for the strategy
ever like the shows there
might add
could certainly benefit from attention
benefit from attention
is no public WiFi
have a chance to see
to see
sit and see the acts
is your best bet
sold a ton of tickets
is good
are slim pickings
is cash-only
need to withdraw cash
to withdraw cash
withdraw cash
get enough in one go
can be enormous
be enormous
exiting and entering the theater
entering and exiting the bathroom
are formed outside the doors
formed outside the doors
do n't sell earplugs
sell earplugs
make sure
bring your own
want to see
to see
'll go
to bring your cups back
bring your cups back
