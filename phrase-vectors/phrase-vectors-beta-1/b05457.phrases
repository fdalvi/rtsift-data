used to

Horrible drive thru
paid at 6:28
looking at the receipt

take less than 5 min
their cars too .
leaving with their food
causing an accident
bringing them it
honked my horn
not answering my question
went back inside
walked in
asked where is my burger
is my burger
observed was confusion
was confusion
like the fries
wanted a burger by itself
demanded a refund immediately
was so upset
giving me a refund
Look up the times
received my refund meanwhile
was late to work
to work
gets that pitiful service
will not change anything
change anything
to ever go there
ever go there
