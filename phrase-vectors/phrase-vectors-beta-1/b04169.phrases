would expect
Whew !

do n't absorb any calories
absorb any calories
was really bad
seemed nice enough
go and tear
refilling the napkins
Just saying
is tasteless and horrible
might come after me
come after me
know that is harsh
is harsh
mean to get a laugh
to get a laugh
get a laugh
even met real Mexican food

should n't be that hard
be that hard
to never eat here again

checking in there on Yelp
Being the drive-up line

looked like a large eyesore
keep from staring at it
staring at it
notice weird things like that
creeps me out

to drive around you
drive around you
is somewhat annoying

ordering even after saying no
saying no

is based on the service
based on the service
have nothing to complain about
