compete with HH specials

am a complete fish lover
think you get the idea
get the idea
see what it was about
was about
checked out their website
not too shabby
What a disappointment .
overcooked my food was
begged for water and silverware
felt when I left
ordered their Cedar Plank Salmon
were burnt
was not quite so charred
rolled her eyes at me
not too packed
to have friends at work
have friends at work
do n't neglect the customer
neglect the customer
came back
fell onto the table
was their mixed drinks

was okay
was a little dry
were fun
were outright boring

is so tasty
run out - true story
cried a little bit
to show my disapproval
show my disapproval
left me drenched and sad
was good
* twitch , * twitch
* twitch
* twitch
have no fear
check it out
get the good stuff

would give red lobster
give red lobster
was born
love seafood
was not good
was all the great either
would not go again
go again
