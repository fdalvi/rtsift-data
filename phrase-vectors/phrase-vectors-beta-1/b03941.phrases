was out shopping
had Gloria Jean 's coffee
ordered a blended mocha
throwing away most of it
was super sweet
will continue on next time
continue on next time

consider myself a coffee snob
drink that much of it
is the case here
used or the coffee beans
has a large overhead
be a $ 2.50 drink
becomes a $ 3.75 drink
being put in my cup
put in my cup
going down my throat

make it so well
walk the mall
are a little pricey
is friendly and smiling
