Horrible parking
take the parallel spaces
backing out
take the regular space
ticked off today
to make a payment
make a payment
were long
moved really slow
took my payment
looked up my other services
was trying to cross-sell me
trying to cross-sell me
to cross-sell me
cross-sell me
have your employees cross sell
cross sell
steer your clients off of
to use my checking account
use my checking account
would ever offer

So ...
need right now
need the money now
find a Bank of America
ca n't do it
do it
go to this location
tail it over there
rush up
close at 5:00
slump over , defeated
slump over
looks at me
opens the door
waves me in
babble off my story
know you close at
really appreciate it
sorry for the hassle
omigod I love you
love you
calms me down
was also kind
left , crisis averted
are saints

considering it
are supposed to
supposed to

's outside the branch side-by-side
are working very slowly
working very slowly
