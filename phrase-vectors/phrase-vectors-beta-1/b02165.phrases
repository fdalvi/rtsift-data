es nahezu ein Muss
g?nstig wie dort
die einen verschlingen
Nicht so in Anthem
ist geradezu idyllisch zu bezeichnen
das ganze Jahr
die Kids begeistert
Die Eltern weniger
die Kleinen klitschnass sind
umfangreicher Auswahl an Essensangeboten
l?sst sich drau?en
zu hei? ist
die Klimaanlage
die unbedingt aufgesucht werden m?ssen
wie in einem 5-Sterne-plus Hotel
zu finden
bei den IKEA-Parkpl?tzen
Und letztendlich
aus dort
