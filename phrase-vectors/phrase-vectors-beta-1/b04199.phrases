Was being the operative word
being the operative word
Hectic ?

just shrugged at me
Undermanaged too
Expect to wait

is nice

Love this place
tucked behind a shopping area
go during the week
have the theater to yourself
have gone on opening weekends
gone on opening weekends
see a movie
sells you the tickets
then hops behind the concession
to sell you the snacks
sell you the snacks
's been sitting
been sitting
being popped
's still not hot
is too hot
love this place

like being around people
being around people
is my movie manifesto
to make sure
make sure
navigating crowded multiplexes
either avoiding hyperactive teenyboppers
being trapped behind slow-moving troglodytes
trapped behind slow-moving troglodytes
find three seats together
crane your neck
tired . .
allow it to continue
to continue
is never PACKED
unattended the movies here are
have come here
come here
sold from the concession stand
'm a huge Superman fan
got to showtime
to showtime
finding seats together
to catch up
catch up
is my Shopportunity
circumvent the real world
dealing with crowds
could get behind
get behind

was n't that busy
talked the ENTIRE TIME
went to alert the employees
to alert the employees
alert the employees
came in the theater
was asked to leave
asked to leave
to leave
seemed like the norm
do n't move
was on the small side
was adequate
moviegoing experience
Pepsi at the snack bar
have Coke
had just popped it fresh
popped it fresh

Understaffed on a Friday night
