a little bored

lied to us
saving $ 100 or so
is what happened
to get a shelter dog
get a shelter dog
would be the best fit
be the best fit
buying anything there
fell in love with

came down $ 150
picked him up we
draw from a bucket
receive either
bite the bullet
pay way more than expected
to get his supplies
get his supplies
had an ear infection
to wait ten days
wait ten days
to pick him up
pick him up
can guess what happened

made us at the beginning
gave us that day
to tell my four year
tell my four year

seen it all

are awful
've never felt more unwelcome
felt more unwelcome
to play with a puppy
play with a puppy
rolling her eyes
went to get the dog
to get the dog
get the dog
was outrageously sad
did not care for toys
care for toys
wanted to be held
to be held
be held
care or love the dogs
