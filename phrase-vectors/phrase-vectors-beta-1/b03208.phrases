is a first class establishment
's about to eat

're damn good
to try and get full

is n't overpoweringly spicy
offers some kick
really makes the wings special
is the texture
spent on the barbecue
come just for drinks
are n't really hungry
to chew on

is cold

do n't get this place

is bad
is terrible
looks dirty
were the fish
are damn good anyway

agree with Richard 's review
visiting New York
living in the southwest
'm originally from the Midwest
trying everything
bar with no windows
playing with her cell phone
strewn about
lining the mostly windowless walls
to be much going on
be much going on
much going on
were present for the meal
lack thereof
were n't hungry
is bland
slid out of my hand
wanted to drink
to drink
was probably a one-time thing
was n't lemon
to say
say anything about the food
was completely lacking
dining in a greasy basement

Love this place
