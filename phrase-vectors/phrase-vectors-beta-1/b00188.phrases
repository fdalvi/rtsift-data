to say the least
say the least
worked with my schedule
did a really nice job

recommend Joyce for bridal alterations
is not friendly at all
bought it at her store
was so excited about it
made me feel rushed
feel rushed
took away from the moment
fixed for $ 100 elsewhere

brought it to her
picked it up
fit like a glove
was timely and friendly

moved to her current location
was way too big
ordered online far in advance
got serious about diet
exercise in the meantime
fit perfectly
felt like a bright-blue bride
was not the friendliest woman
done when promised

is on the quieter side
not unfriendly
recommend her to a friend

does a great job
is straightforward

was THE BEST
added a gorgeous bustle
did was perfect
was perfect
was amazing
was `` not friendly ''
be the case at all
to be professional and straightforward
be professional and straightforward
fawn all over me
treat me like a child
