was a nightmare
could n't get to us
get to us
to call our cell
call our cell
kept calling our landline
calling our landline
got the plumber out
have the part with him
had described the problem
described the problem
bother to bring the parts
to bring the parts
bring the parts
to get it
get it
doing so
was so horrible about scheduling
pay attention to our needs
gouged us for the privilege
need one

Very disappointed .
scheduled my appointment
would call 15 minutes before
call 15 minutes before
Did n't happen
was still on the schedule
called at 5:45
would n't make it

wasted an entire day
brings it to $ 146.45
was an nice guy
is ridiculous
get in the truck
drive to the office
cut a pipe
thread the pipe
drive back to your home
install the pipe
is 1 miles each way
makes sense
wo n't

honor warranties in timely fashion
have a warranty
come and look at it
need hot water
answered the phone
were also very unfriendly


to fix the problem
fix the problem
to tally up the bill
tally up the bill
started talking and talking
talking and talking
seriously about a half hour
talking about something totally unrelated
charged us for that time
could have been charged less
have been charged less
been charged less
charged less
How annoying !

was leaking
trying to use it
to use it
use it
came out real quick
took apart the valve
removing the gate
sealing it back up
does not leak
does not function
call a second plumber in
hack out the valve
removing a little dirt
to fully expose the valve
fully expose the valve
getting his dainty hands dirty

did n't have it

said their supplier no longer
carries it
was a plumbing supply store
