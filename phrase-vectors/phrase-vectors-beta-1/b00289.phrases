w/a hardshell taco
was cold
had any chicken in it
was very disappointed
recommend this place to anyone
is far better

Every once in a while
's off to Taco Bell
Love those things

went to this location tonight
ordered food
took my order
got the order wrong
fixed the problem immediately
was polite
was a plus
Thank you
