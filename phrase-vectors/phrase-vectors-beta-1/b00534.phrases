have a few bullet wounds
tats too
already shaking in my heels
was overpriced
bought the booze
Left as quick as possible
take the drive through
bashed them a bit
the dog . .

size and make of alcohol
are ok
have a drive thru

is convenient
overpriced as hell
have shit selection
was nice
are ridiculous
know what they carry
forget about the drive thru
to go back really
go back really
