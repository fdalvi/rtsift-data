were both amazing
was our wedding minister
do them at his chapel
's just pretty small
was a non-denominational ceremony
do whatever you want
is very reasonable
firming up details
was wonderful as well
enjoyed working with them
working with them
to officiate your wedding
officiate your wedding
are kinda boring
's fun
was the ceremony

was simply amazing
was at ease
did n't want
beautifully wove in the things
is also EXTREMELY ARTICULATE
've been to other weddings
been to other weddings
having a great ceremony
Having Gwen officiate our ceremony
officiate our ceremony
or even the venue

is nothing short of phenomenal
