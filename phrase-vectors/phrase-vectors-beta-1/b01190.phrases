have this Bashas review
why all the trouble ?
is a facilitator
fuel our lives
contribute to our happy memories
to help us
help us
wash away the bad ones
going green
started my affinity for cooking
's right
earned cash on
do n't even realize it
realize it
need this Bashas
need you , Bashas
need you

a few times .
would never go back
go back
were checking out
checking out
was so rude
were checking us out
checking us out
unprofessional if you ask me
ask me
lived there
is not
is right across the street

'm torn
have crappy bread and produce
have crappy bread
rotted within a day
stuck together
went moldy

go to Bashas
is for the convenience
waiting in the checkout line
bought some crackers for work
have one
give you a courtesy swipe
ca n't give 0
give 0

like giving a tough review
giving a tough review
to address a couple things
address a couple things
should just no offer produce
think it was an afterthought
was an afterthought
would n't cost much money
cost much money
making this store
to place for me
place for me
Not there right now .

Just found out this store
gone there in the past
is a disaster
to get to the store
get to the store
doubt most people do
like the exercise
had poor customer service
seemed to have changed
to have changed
have changed
are n't firing the employees
firing the employees
Sounded to me like everyone
was getting transferred
getting transferred
