is no different
want to work there
to work there
work there
should find another job
find another job
feel like taking my order
taking my order
In your face .

like Wendy 's

am rolling through here
rolling through here
needed to get through security
to get through security
get through security
to pick up something
pick up something
made at this Wendy 's

was starved
was super long
super long
had 1 register open
register open
had an hour to spare
to spare
to wait for hot food
wait for hot food
went quick
do n't get
working in the back kitchen
was baffled
came and went
questioned my order
was given
to wait for my food
wait for my food
Really ?
