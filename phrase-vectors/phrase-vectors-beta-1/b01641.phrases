am not a Catholic myself
seems nice there
can feel welcome then

is n't a church
is a beautifully decorated church
seems to have good people
to have good people

was stiller
was great
was a sad day
made it a lot easier
would show up

were provided
allowed to bring our own
to bring our own
bring our own

return for early Sunday Mass
to be very cathartic
be very cathartic
