have a car problem
was n't working properly
working properly

love A Plus Auto Repair
finished repairs very quickly
've recommended
would go back
go back

is the owner

could n't be happier
be happier
are honest
has always been fair
been fair
went bad
needed it replaced
towed to the shop
confirmed the issue
having it replaced
paying for yet another tow
had perspective buyers come buy
come buy
to go above and beyond
go above and beyond
