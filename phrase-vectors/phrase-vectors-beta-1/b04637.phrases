Always friendly employees .

fix what 's broken
's broken
live by the golden rule
to use pumps
use pumps
in a pinch

think is very rude
is very rude
putting things in my purse
had multiple items
have taken some initiative
taken some initiative
talking on her cell phone

Absolutely horrible service .
tried to tell me
to tell me
tell me
would get fired
get fired
refused to come outside
to come outside
come outside
starts to set
to set

make it a trillion
`` be back shortly ''
