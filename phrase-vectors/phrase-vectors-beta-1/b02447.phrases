have not been that great
been that great
is nice
is not great
made me an appoint
has guardianship
called to confirm the appt
to confirm the appt
confirm the appt
was not there
got to the office
to be seen
be seen
wanted me the parent there
did not believe my eldest
believe my eldest
had guardianship
wanted proof
did get worked out
get worked out
worked out
was seen
to get it worked out
get it worked out
worked out
keeps me going back
going back
is in progress
work out their office issues

met at a dentist office
started giving me issues
giving me issues
was sick
care for their patients
to get it changed
get it changed
getting all three wisdom teeth
pulled from my face
feel confident about your smile

has been awful
been awful
is not great
wait for an appoint
destroyed my perfect credit
would n't remove
