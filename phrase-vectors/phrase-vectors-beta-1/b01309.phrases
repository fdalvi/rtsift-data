to get there after work
get there after work
coming from any real distance
do n't realize
originated in Eastern Europe
were open
filled cake
have ever had

what a great place
was a little over loaded
a little over loaded

wish I stopped somewhere else
stopped somewhere else
was so disappointed in this
walked in
looked so good
live up to the image
can think
purchased everything at noon
eat it until 6:45
might be better
be better
'll see
try it out again
go on a bad day
hope so

to consider Jana 's mine
consider Jana 's mine
to find little location
find little location
been shining down that day
shining down that day
stop in once a month
runs the front
is awesome
feeling here
Stop in
make breakfast out of it

bought a poppy seed coffecake
look like real poppy seeds
had a weird chocolaty taste
were lots of things missing
were pretty empty
used to have
to have
will improve

is nice
have to be all showy
to be all showy
be all showy
was very nice and talkative
gave me a free pastry
were all great
was talkin ' about
talkin ' about

pastries , and pierogi
is frozen
had a problem with freshness
sell out quickly

Have passed a hundred times
passed a hundred times
decided to stop
to stop
Walked in
felt like i
Picked a coffee cake
was compeble with grocers
was twice the size
has another steady customer
drive down from CaveCreek
making them myself

go no further
to take to any
take to any
is the place to come
to come
taste just as good
eaten in the deli yet
's really good too

very nice European style bakery

goes very quickly
is Jana

was n't overly impressed
dice by here multiple times
being a connoisseur
had to stop in
to stop in
stop in
had just opened
just opened
tell you the hours
Bring cash
is their credit card limit
was n't much selection
bought two Danishes and cookies
assume is a big draw
is a big draw
may attempt another visit
attempt another visit
'm really hungry
could be replaced
