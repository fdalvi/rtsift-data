taking the money
sitting on a counter
tosses some pepperoni on it
was hungry
to say I
say I
did n't finish it
finish it
ordered my slice

learned something !!

are in Casa Grande
find a better pizza place
lacks that certain something
was mediocre
was really tasty
was HUGE
was decent in taste
to write home about
write home about

be honest for Casa Grande
are not that bad
are both GROSS
are really good
places in town

are nice and attentive
hands down

come here for pizza
be bad based on reviews
was wrong
just sprinkled the ingredients on
was a decent thin crust
were greasy
insist on getting pizza here
getting pizza here
do n't get the sausage
get the sausage


is good
call cheese fries
could n't tell
melted on it
pick up one fry
get all of the cheese
Really a poor idea .

was good
