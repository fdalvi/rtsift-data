feels like a resort
come over
say the same thing
to re-new my lease
re-new my lease
want to raise the rent
to raise the rent
raise the rent

Been here a week
at first
seemed nice
have a MAJOR Cockroach problem
's disgusting
have been a red flag
been a red flag
making me wait till Thursday
wait till Thursday
disclose the serious pest infestation
kills roaches within seconds

chewed up our christmas tree
seemed nice and helpful
came when we moved out
moved out
to replace it
replace it
to address that issue
address that issue
go into their office
're supposed to repaint anyway
supposed to repaint anyway
to repaint anyway
repaint anyway
called about the charges
moved in
FIND our move-in paperwork
What the hell .
decorated the front sidewalk with
renting the pressure washer
was using
told me Camden OWNED
are liable for
felt like a freaking lawyer
might stick
rent on time
being good tenants
felt we deserved better
deserved better
