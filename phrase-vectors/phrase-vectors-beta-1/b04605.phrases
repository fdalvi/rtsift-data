love this place
is pretty darn good
to look forward to
look forward to
do n't think that
think that
's nice

is ok
are friendly
is cold
is average at best
use some updating inside
updating inside

was awful
forgot my husband 's drink
to come out
come out
sticks for $ 7.49
sticks come with ranch
come with ranch
disappeared halfway through our dinner
all together

go outside and smoke
make out with some guy
washing hands

Fun atmosphere and huge menu
are the best
am considering
is fantastic

melt with guac
handmake the onion rings
was cold
was hot

is NASCAR country
Love the atmosphere
head out
looks like a living room
to hang out
hang out
go with some friends
'll like it
like it

have ever eaten
've traveled through Arkansas
traveled through Arkansas
's saying something
saying something
being there
went downhill from there
have ever eaten
were barely appetizing
was completely without flavor
Ordered with grilled onions
arrived with mushrooms on it
were the steak fries
And the atmosphere
is very hard to describe
to describe
is ambitious
has some potential
to liven it up
liven it up
decided to serve food
to serve food
serve food

is for the drinkers
must admit
just want to go out
to go out
go out
to stay home and drink
stay home and drink
's nothing else to do
to do
is a cool girl
Cute too
expect a club type bar
to pick up chicks
pick up chicks
seem to be the loudest
to be the loudest
be the loudest
like the mixed drinks
's good
've never tried the food
tried the food
say much about that

would expect from a bar
expect from a bar
have a dartboard

was pretty empty
was friendly
ordered a French Dip
was on the bottom
was clear on top
had coloring in it
coloring in it
`` swiss cheese
was not Swiss cheese
