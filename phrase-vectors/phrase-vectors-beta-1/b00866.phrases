tried the Vanilla Honey Bee
taste the subtle honey flavor
be a big honey fan
do n't get it
get it
* # !



is wonderful
Thank god
have no willpower
live across the street

was teeny
to be specific
be specific
was teeny
go by
's still good

to just go for desserts
just go for desserts

Not impressed .
getting some ice cream
* everything *
put out by our experience
just wanted to leave
to leave
had allergies
looked at us blankly
have it in a book
could see the book
see the book
saying anything
grabbed the book
took it from him
turned away from him
had some sort of problem
Friendly ... Love that
was not
despised his low paying job
to be in his presence
be in his presence
was having a bad day
having a bad day
was just a jerk
the case
were palpable
flipped absentely through the book
was okay
thank you as we left
were leaving
could see their every move
see their every move
to speak to a manager
speak to a manager
would go get the manager
go get the manager
get the manager
came back and said
came back
'm sorry
's not here
would be back in
be back in
Call me crazy
may be
paying customers
continue working with the public
working with the public
care what his problem was
Not my issue .
endure the heat without aid
