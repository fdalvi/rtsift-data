4 I like Lee and I like his paintings.  I've been highly anticipating the raw/vegan restaurant he's suppose to open!  I don't usually dig the music that plays there, but lots of people do.  Yay for them!
1 I don't like to criticize Art not being an artist, nor music not having the balls to get on stage myself. That being said I went to Phix last night to see a band, the place was lacking AC, the bathrooms were disgusting, the sound sucked, the art.... I paid $8 bucks for that torture and that hour of my life I will not get back.
2 I went to the Phix last Tuesday to see Fucked Up. I never got around to looking at the art work. Sorry. Sunny B is correct about the sound. I couldnt hear the vocals for shit. We ended up leaving early. The things I did like about the place though was it had a cool atmosphere, the kids were all really into the music and super excited to be there and the security is not so extreme that your uncomfortable to have fun. I hate when you go the a venue and the security guards are a bunch of doosh bags. This is a place where you can let loose and really just go all out. They do not serve booz so it's an all ages venue. So yeh! for the kiddies.
