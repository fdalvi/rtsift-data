5 Nice, friendly, efficient staff.  Dr. Kindt is thorough and professional.  So glad we found a good dentist for when we are vacationing in this area!
5 Dr. Kindt has been my dentist for 5 years. He is without question the best I have gone to. I had never had one I liked for the last 30 years. Now I wish I had found him sooner. My wife also goes there and the kids will as well once they are old enough.  He is gentle, caring and always explains what is going on, what needs done and why. Unlike others he asks throughout the process if you are still numb or feeling pain.  His whole staff is professional and very nice also! His office is clean, modern and I have never had more than a few minutes wait.  Very highly recommend Tim!! Try him and you will love him as well!
5 How fortunate to find a dentist who is excellent at what he does and is funny too! His humor actually takes a little bit of the pain away!!  Seriously, if you're in the Mesa/Tempe/Scottsdale area and are looking for a top notch dentist look no further! The staff is wonderful. Helpful and beyond friendly!
5 Honest dentist who puts people's health over profit! His staff is the best. The office  ladies are nice and work space is immaculately clean. Best dentist I have ever been too.  Finally a dentist I can trust!
