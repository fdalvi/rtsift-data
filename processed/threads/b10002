3 I'm reviewing this laundromat since there are zero reviews for it and a) I wanna be the first and b) someone's gotta say something!  Since my SO is stuck in Vegas for work for an entire month, he needed to find a laundromat since he wasn't hot on the idea of paying $5 a shirt to have housekeeping do it. Being the helpful, visiting SO that I am, I wanted to find a laundromat away from the strip and not too up north. The laundromat we actually wanted to go to was closed for Easter Sunday and we just happened to stumble upon Deva's.  Here is what you need to know: To wash is $1.25 (basic wash, not counting those jumbo washing machines) To dry is .25 cents Change machine available for quarters and vending machine for detergent & fabric softener (although it's preferable to bring your own since it's kind of a rip-off)  There is a tiny convenience store (on-site) that sells drinks & snacks. Public restroom available, a Pac-Man & pinball machine and a couple small flat-screens for your entertainment. I don't know what the culture of coin laundromats are supposed to be, having almost always had own washer/dryer at home, but this place gets the job done : )
2 Hey! This place is named Deva's Laundromat & Dry Cleaning but they DO NOT do dry cleaning!  The man said they haven't done dry cleaning in over 8 years.
4 We're in Henderson for a few days, and kind of in a bond as far as laundry goes, so I was hoping to find a decent place to get caught up. Deva's wasn't bad, and though some of the equipment was out of service, that's to be expected with that many washers and dryers.   The large commercial washing machines cost $4.50 to run, and the small top-loaders are $1.75. The dryers are 25Â¢ per 6 minutes, which means you'll dump at least $1.50 per load to dry them.   The facilities are clean enough, and there were plenty of available machines when I was there mid-morning, and the attached mini-mart was handy for a quick breakfast pastry.
