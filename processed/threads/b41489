5 My new favorite Hookah Lounge. Large leather couches. Very clean, very new. Nice menu service. Pay as you leave. $10 a hookah per 3 people. Large selection of sheesh. Huge tv's that play sports on silent, while modern melodic rap music plays over high quality speakers. Nice selections of snacks too. The tables light up as well. Very peaceful unlike those other half-minded loud hookah lounges around town.
5 Looking for a time to have fun with some friends enjoy some comfy as$ couches and smoke that FIRE HOOKAH shoot through here. This is THE SPOT. place big enough to have two parties going on. DJ is off the hook honestly nothing feels better than smoking to hookah listening to Biggie, Tupac, West Coast 562 hip hop, and  new school club bangers. Can't go wrong with the flavors or the prices. I just watched the Lakers beat the Knicks tonight and honestly best place to enjoy it. Shoot through trust me no regrets!
4 The owner is an ASU Alum!!!!! Killer atmosphere and bomb couches. Best place to kick it in the West Valley. Just wish they weren't closed at random times.
