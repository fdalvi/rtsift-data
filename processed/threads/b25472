5 I picked up my U-Haul here for my move to Tucson and was pleasantly surprised by the service that I received. I have moved a few times and have never been impressed by U-Haul service stations that are usually run "on the side" to make the business more money.   However, the woman who helped check me in was very high spirited, friendly and helped ease some of the early morning dread of having to spend the day moving. I would recommend anyone to pick up their U-Haul here in the morning.
5 I would highly recommend using this location. Sue was wonderfully helpful. We had a size issue with our original trailer so we called the regional office to see if we could swap to another size. They said it'd be no problem and they'd communicate with the pick up location. Apparently no communication was made but Sue took great care of us and made sure we were set up with the right trailer this time. I was so impressed with how well Sue handled the confusion.   I would highly recommend renting trailers from this location!
5 Amazing customer service. The guys were super friendly. I was super stressed moving and they helped me check in and out lightning fast. I would highly recommend them and will definitely be going back if I ever need to move again.  :)
1 i was lied to and left stranded for 9 days and missed thanksgiving with my family and 3 days of work. i payed my deposit with Cash and they tell me that it will be refunded to me upon return. i returned it and was told that i would get a check sent to me in 24 to 72 hours. not 7 business days. seems the story changes every time you talk to someone different. nobody has correct and accurate information and their customer service is terrible i would not wish this upon my worst enemy. no compensations for being left stranded and missing 3 days work NOTHING! just i understand and truly apologize.  What a joke. this is not a professional company at least not some of its workers!
