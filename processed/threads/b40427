4 It was our second time ordering.. Our first pizza was good, it could have used more sauce, so this time around I just ordered more sauce, the house salad is soo good too!!  Its big enough for two people!
5 This place is good. I was skeptical at first but once i took a bite of my pizza i was delighted. The dough is so soft, and delicious. The cheese and pepperoni was perfect, put in enough sauce, i do not like a lot of sauce just enough to taste it. We got a large pizza and 8 wings plus a 2 ltr soda all for 14 and change. Good price, the wings were nice and hot as well.
5 Hands down the best pizza in Avondale they make everything fresh made once you order. They have great prices not expensive at all they have great deals all the times !!! Once you try it you'll fall in love with there  pizza crust it's to die for !!!!
