5 the food was soooooo gooooood.  I got the pulled pork, and it's really easy to get pulled pork wrong, but this place got it perfectly right with a twist along the way. The pork was served with a side of tortilla chips, beans, rice, and a tasty sauce made of mint - this sauce was what set this place apart for me. I also ate some of my friends chips with a chili mayo sauce they brought out. I was eating it so barbarically because it was the best kind of combination. This place just opened so I'm really excited to see what it turns into, but as a start, really impressed!  Imagine eating good food with great music playing in the background, you can't go wrong!
