5 The Pizza is great and the owner is very friendly. I love the wings and everything else!
3 The restaurant was clean and bright. The service was fast & friendly - fantastic. The food was very good and Halal, but a bit greasy. We ordered the lasagna with meat sauce, chicken fingers, and the buffalo chicken pizza. The dough was crisp, the chicken was well cooked. Would've preferred more cheese, so will request extra next time. Son n daughter finished their chicken & lasagna, respectively, and said that they really enjoyed it! Great place for a quick and inexpensive family dinner night.
2 Does Not honor Yelp discount beware!  I generally Dont like to give negative reviews. So i'll leave this open ended. Business for them seems good. my experience was alright...
