3 Wow!!! This Safeway has both a Starbucks and a Jamba Juice!!! I would never see both drink places in a Safeway back in Northern California.   In addition, there is also a Gelato Corner!!! MmmM.. I was tempted by the creme brulee, tiramisu, burgundy cherry, and sorbet flavors. Luckily I said "no" since that would be a unhealthy meal for lunch. If a gelato section was in my neighborhood Safeway, I would go all the time and gain 10 pounds in a year from all that gelato.   Prices for gelato: + Small : $2.99 + Regular : $3.99 + Pint: $5.49  You can also get samples, but I didn't want to ask for any.
5 The Fountain Hills Safeway is the largest store in the Scottsdale area and is the most profitable. This store is about 55,000 square feet. It has a Jamba Juice, a Starbucks, a gelato bar, and you can order your own custom subs. Included in the store is a 30 person seating area equipped with Wi-Fi. They have 12 checkouts; their employees are very friendly and helpful.
5 Very nice staff, I'm going to miss it as I move a little further away. However I use the online ordering and it's great to wish other stores did this
4 Great, local grocer to fulfill my everyday needs.   Always friendly service/associates to be found throughout the store.   Deli is great - especially whoever roasts their Deli Chickens - yum! Produce seems to be fresh and "in-stock".   Love they have Starbucks also at this location.   Only drawback would be length of lines. Seems like whatever day/time I visit here, they usually are 3-4 deep at each POS. Seems excessive? I dunno.
1 Always long lines.  Service is slow.  I think the social hour should be outside on your break not when I am waiting in line.
