1 I am so frustrated with Vegas Cellular right now !  I called to ask how much it would be to replace the cracked glass on my Samsung Galaxy S4 and they said it was $80.  I asked him if he could do any better and he said just come in and talk to me.  I explained that I am coming from Henderson and if I was going to come in I needed to know the best price over the phone.  He agreed on $70, so I packed up my two young kids and we drove across town to get my phone fixed.  I go in, verify that I am talking to the same guy as on the phone (I think he is the owner....name is Mansoor) and we begin talking details.  He prints out the agreement and it says $120!  I told him we agreed on $70 and he started to tell me that I had told him I had an S3 on the phone when we spoke and not an S4.  Um, NO!  I did not say I had an S3....and why does that even matter....a $50 difference!?  He stated the best he could do was $100.  If I wanted to pay $100 I would just do it through my phone's insurance plan.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.  They are not trustworthy.
5 I came in to get my cracked ipad 3 fixed. He charged me $100. I dropped it off before they closed & it was ready the next day. Excellent service!!!!
5 Excellent repair completed on my IPad 2. It was water damaged. I was told that they would do everything possible to get it to work. Well... They got it working again. Job well done!!! I'm so happy with the repair. Owner is a very nice man. The prices he quoted were fair and reasonable. I highly recommend them!! Also replaced glass on my 4s!! Another fair price and great work!  My daughter just dropped her iPad 2 and the screen cracked!!! I'm taking it in tomorrow for repair. I would not go anywhere else for my devices.
