2 This place is severely overpriced.  Secondhand couches for $700.00... um I think not.  Their clothes are all extremely worn as well but that doesn't stop them from charging 5.99 for them.  I would go to a different thrift store if I were you.
1 Way over priced!  We are huge thrifters and this used to be one of our favorite stops than things changed after john junker became their new CEO.  There is hardly ever a turnover to their inventory because they aren't selling anything , it's the same stuff week after week.  The fun of thrifting is finding a bargain or good deal but there aren't any here to be found anymore.  It's not even any fun to just look because nothing ever changes.
