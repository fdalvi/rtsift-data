2 Called in 7 pizzas for a school party to be picked up at 12:45. Got here at 12:43 to pick up our pizzas. Not ready, they placed them in the oven as I paid. The manager, not looking up from his computer, said "you didn't forget them, did you". Guess they did. At least they'll be fresh right?!?!?  The pizzas were great,  the accuracy for pickup & service, very lacking!
1 Went into this store 20 minutes before closing. The doors were open. Normally I am very understanding of things being unavailable closer to closing, however the guy said that they were closed and out of everything. We asked for the managers name and he said he was the manager. I don't understand why during their business hours they would have NO pizza whatsoever and to top it off the guy was completely rude about it. Not to mention there were 2 girls waiting outside to back him up with "yeah he said he's closed" giggling as we walked away. This store is completely unprofessional and I will never take my business there again.
5 Placed my order before I went to go pick up our order because usually at dinner time they get really busy.  Service was quick, easy and friendly, pizza is delicious and my mom LOVED the garlic parm wings!
5 It's $5 pizza. For the money it's perfect, my kids love it. The employees are mostly young kids who joke around with each other and seem to not hate their job. It's a factory and in the summer it must be rough. For $5 to feed 4 kids I don't think you could get more satisfaction.
