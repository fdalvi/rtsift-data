5 I recently took a course with Harper and he did a great job. He was very thorough about safety and properly handling a firearm. You can tell he definitely has real world experience and truly cares about the information he provides to make sure you understand and feel comfortable in the firearm practice exercises. I would definitely return for additional training." ~ MIke G.
5 On a recent visit to Las Vegas, I attended a private Handgun Course with a group of friends that was provided by Paladin Security Solutions.  I've been to gun ranges and have had some firearms instruction by friends in the past, but I have to admit that this course gave me greater confidence and knowledge on how to properly and safely handle a firearm.  Instructor Harper was thorough, patient, and showed us some real skills we could use for firearms self-defense.  I hope to catch another course on my next visit or take some private lessons.  It is well worth it.  The staff was professional, accommodated our needs, and gave us a full day of value well beyond what we paid.  If you're interested in learning how to improve your firearms handling and shooting skills, I would highly recommend this organization and especially the instructor, Harper.
5 I had never shot a gun before and was nervous about doing it. These guys made it very simple to understand how fire arms are just a tool for self defense and the basics can be learned easily. The course is great...the instructors really know their stuff! I'm looking forward to taking a more advanced class from them.
