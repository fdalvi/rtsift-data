4 This place is great for finding a bargain and I have to admit, with the City full of charity shops, this little gem is sure competition.   Located in the pretty area of Bruntsfield this place seems to gather some very decent stock (with regards to ladies clothing) and occasionally some big designers make a short appearance on the racks, before being whipped up by my more experienced charity shopper friend. Because of its small size and location it seems to be quite a quiet place- at least the couple of times I have been in.   Worth a visit even if it is just to browse.
4 The Bagpus charity shop on Tollcross is a typical local charity shop.  You have the mandatory bookcase, clothes racks, ornaments and minimal items of furniture.  The prices continue on this level and you start to realise that these are prices of a local charity shop in a small town, yet the charity shop is in the middle of the city.  The result of all this is that you get a fantastic amount of bargains.  You may think I'm exaggerating, but let me tell you a story of the best deal I've ever had in a charity shop.  One day I walk in and there's two books (Agatha Christie's if you are interested) for 50p each; not a bad deal I thought so I bought them both.  Then a week later I'm back in and now they have more of these books, but now at 30p so I ended up buying 5 more - 5 books for £1.50.  For some of the more expensive charity book shops you can't even buy one book for £1.50, this really is a great value for money shop.
