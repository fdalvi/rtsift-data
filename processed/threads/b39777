5 Great facility! Parking for alternative fuel vehicles and bicycle racks. Inside is neat clean and new. Great improvement over old facility.
1 I was denied care at this facility over when it is appropriate to ask patients for the copay.  I will not pay for services before they are rendered; thus, when I objected to paying before seeing the doctor, I was told to leave.  When I told the staff that if I had a serious condition and that by refusing treatment they were potentially opening themselves to the possibility of a lawsuit, I was told "go ahead and sue us."  This behavior is abhorrent.  I will be reporting this facility to the state medical board.
