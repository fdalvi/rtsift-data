5 The West family has been taking care of my families vehicles for decades...you will not find a more professional and honest shop in this city. They have saved us so many times I cannot even count.   For brake jobs, in depth engine repair, or hardcore troubleshooting they will take great care of you plain and simple.
5 James West and company are the real deal. Honest mechanics and really nice people. James kept my 1990 ISUZU TROOPER humming along. Once, he even loaned me his personal vehicle while the Trooper was in for major mechanical work. Simply the best, honest and humble about being AMAZING ! !
5 Very HONEST!  I would highly recommed them.  I have used them for 4 years and never had a problem.
2 I decided to go to them bc I heard good reviews and they gave me a pretty decent quote. I needed an AC system repair which takes about 5-6 hours. The job got done but they took entirely too long to do it. Along with their poor communication skills due to their lack of calling, I never knew when I was getting my car back. I dropped my car off on a Monday afternoon and didn't end up getting it back until wednesday right before they closed. During that whole time they only called me once, and every time I called to see if my car was ready they gave me a new finish time. They didn't even call to notify me that my car was finished. They got the job done at a reasonable price, but you run the chance of being car less for a while which is pretty difficult and frustrating for me.
