5 Just opened yesterday...this place is a gem! So happy they're here, the food was amazing! I think I found a new Thai place in Summerlin! Definitely recommend the Pad Thai! Amazing!!!
5 Fantastic Family Owned Thai place in the Vons Shopping Center. Friendly service and great food. We had the Pad Thai and fried spinach and I recommend both!
2 I ordered Pad Thai with beef A La Cart. First thing I noticed was it was a small portion.  Second thing was there wasn't much beef. Beef was a little tough but for the most part it was tasty. Different from many Thai places.  I also ordered a large Tom Yum soup with chicken. Standard size amount. This too was prepared differently than most places. Chicken was tough and flavor was ehhhh   Place has seats for inside eating but restaurant is designed for take out.  Small portion sizes along with the cost makes this an undesirable place for me to return. For $23 ...I expected more
5 Fantastic Thai food! This place is my new favorite lunch spot. Everything has really great flavor and spice. Awesome vegetarian dishes too! The eggplant is my favorite!
5 The owners are super nice and the food is delicious. We have tried the pad thai, panang curry, pineapple fried rice, golden purses and fried spinach and it was all really good. Curry is spicier than other places.  We actually like the smaller portions (although you can get full portions too) and we don't mind paying a premium for a great place in our neighborhood. The food is very fresh, which is awesome.
5 At first I was surprised by the use of tinfoil but it kept my meal nice and hot all the way. Next time I need to order spicer!! Noodles were moist and delightful.   Pad Tai lunch special $9 and made fresh to order - I will be back.
