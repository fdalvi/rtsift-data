4 This place is so freaking huge!!!  You know how some book stores need to serve Coffee to make you stay longer?  This music store has a cafe because you'll be there so long you may need sustenance!  I'm always going to prefer a locally owned spot, but if you're looking for a massive all-you-can-eat-buffet of movies and music - this is your place.  A section for just about everything.  They have CD's, DVD'd and VHS tapes of all types - music, movie, bio, concert footage - you name it.  A healthy section of listening sections for new material.  Great selections of box sets.  They even have some of the fun pop-stuff to go with these things.  Harry Potter lunch box.  Hello Kitty notebook.  James Bond martini set.  The Faint t-shirts.  That kind of thing.    Best part is - they almost always have sales.  Tons of stuff for 9.99 - which means it's hard to walk through the place without picking up at least one thing.  And if you're in the mood to do some serious shopping, the cafe has a seat with your name on it.
5 I still can't believe they closed this place down and replaced it with a P.O.S. Forever21! I LOVED going here and picking up all kinds of CDs and DVDs that you couldn't find anywhere else unless you ordered online. The fact that it went through the center of the mall and was essentially a shortcut made it even cooler.   It wouldn't have been so bad if they had at the very least put another CD/DVD store here but no, we needed another crappy cheap teen clothing store. Thanks a lot Arizona Mills.
