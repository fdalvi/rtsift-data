5 I have been going to Molli for over 5 years.  I love her!  She's an awesome colorist and stylist.  Great location, great conversation, awesome prices.  You can't beat what she offers in Old Town Scottsdale area for cut and color.
5 I met Molli this evening and was very happy to have met such a talented hair stylist and woman. I came into Mollie's studio after a hairstylist royally messed up my hair by adding 4 different shades of color; one which came out orange and one other that came out bleach blonde white (almost gray looking). Molli, was gracious enough to come into her studio which by the way.. is adorable, to help me correct my hair before the holidays. She took her time and was VERY personable and funny. I enjoyed being there and really liked my hair. Much better than before! If you are looking for an experienced and affordable stylist, she is your girl.
5 Molly is amazing!  After leaving many (expensive) salons over the years with the same hairstyle (other stylists would not layer my very long hair as I requested), I went to Molli on a friend' s suggestion.   She gave me the style I had requested and did an excellent job.  Her prices are very reasonable and she is a lovely person.  FINALLY FOUND MY STYLIST!!!
