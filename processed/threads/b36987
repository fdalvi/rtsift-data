5 I went in scared of dental work after hiding from it for many years.  The whole experience was surprisingly pleasant and not painful at all.  Great, nice, gentle people!  I had Dr Larson
5 I can honestly say I enjoyed getting my front crown replaced by Dr. Heday.  It was easier than the original and the staff were genuinely caring and kind which helped put me at ease.  Now my crown looks natural, not a joke like my last dentist had left it, longer than the tooth next to it.  Since I had it fixed, my lisp is gone and I have even gotten a new girlfriend and a promotion at work.  Dr. Heday also was kind enough to assess some fillings from another dentist and made minor adjustments for free.
5 This was my first dental visit in Arizona. The office was recommended by a friend. They were able to see me the very next day. I was extremely nervous but as soon as i walked in I felt very welcome. The doctor was able to keep my mind off the treatment being done and made me feel comfotable the whole time. Not scared of the dentist anymore! Thanks Dr. Larson!
5 I'm ashamed to say that I had managed to avoid going to the dentist for many years until I found Dr. Larson's office on Yelp. I liked the fact that they were open on Saturdays and was even able to request an appointment online.      Dr. Larson was professional, friendly and had a very calming demeanor which really helped put me at ease. Being almost 7 months pregnant, I had several concerns which he patiently discussed with me and his dental assistants were friendly and personable as well.     Ultimately I received my X-rays, exam and a full cleaning (which he completed himself) for less than $100 and have a sound dental health plan going forward. I am really grateful to have found Dr. Larson's office so I don't have to be afraid of going to the dentist anymore.  :)
