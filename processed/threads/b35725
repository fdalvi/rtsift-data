4 Friendly and very happy to have new customers.  I was super happy with my fill and my polish change on my toes!  Got myself a cute little jack o'lantern!  I'll definitely be back!
5 I've been going here for about 2 months now and they always take great care of me. Even when one of the techs messed up my nails I went back and Deena (I think that was her name) took care of me and I got everything fixed right away. They always remember me too which is very important to me. I would defiantly recommend them to all my friends!
4 Was there for my first pedi.  My sis told me about this place and asked if I would try it out.  Got there and was greeted right away.  My tech was a guy and he did an awesome job.  HOT STONE message, YEAH!  Why the 4 stars?  It was just a tad warm in there.    Friendly service and they speak ENGLISH!
5 Had the most memorable experience here!! Everyone was so nice and talkative! My tech Sarah was very outgoing and did a fantastic job on my mani/pedi! I will definitely come back again when I am in the area!
4 My first visit has been great.   I helped right away and the attention to detail was great.   I had a pedi, mani and eyebrows.  My technician was friendly and fun.   I'm definitely coming back.  Oh and to boot they offered bottled water and the place did not smell like acetone!!
4 They are friendly and great... Would give 5 stars if they didn't nick my finger and toe! I love my nails and the pedi and mani they gave my boyfriend was so awesome!
4 I'm currently looking for a new nail salon, which can be stressful. Thankfully I found T2 Nails. Not only were they friendly and professional, they did an excellent job for a reasonable price. I am definitely going back.
2 Well I tried this place out based on other reviews and based on the fact that it was close to my house and I have to say this is the first time I have been disappointed by my fellow yelpers. I opted for a deluxe pedicure since my feet were looking pretty sad and that part of it was pretty good. A young guy did it and we were talking about football and my feet did come out pretty soft but he used glue on one of my nails because he said it was lifting. I found it kind of weird as in the last 15 years or so of getting my nails done I have never had someone do that but that was fine I just went with it. Now on to my gel manicure. I have been getting these done for a while too so I am pretty familiar with how they should look and feel. So to start I told her I wanted to keep the same shape just wanted them shorter and they came out looking nothing like it and I have some pretty sharp edges. Since I am a nurse and mother of an infant I am going to have to file them myself. Next they will be easy to file myself since the tips weren't painted! I have ALWAYS had the tips painted to help with making the color last. My thumb nail was breaking right at the corner of the nail and she didn't do anything with it except paint over it.  Lastly the sides of some of my nails aren't painted! To top all of that off she was on her cell phone while doing my nails! Really?!?!? I would get fired from my job if I did that! All in all even though the pedicure was decent I can't say it is worth my time or money to go back.
5 Excellent work. I had a back fill and eye brow wax done. The back fill looks great and he didn't hurt me at all. I'm a little picky about my eyebrows and they look great too. Peter did my nails. I don't know the name of the lady that did my eyebrows.
5 I got an eyebrow and gel nail done. I'm soo picky about where I go to get services since I have been to my fair share of un sanitized salons. The staff was friendly and they took their time to make my nails and eyebrows look better than on point! I wish I knew the names of the two but they have gained a happy customer! The 20% off coupon offered by yelp was the icing on the delishly pink and accent gel nail I got
4 my nail lady was really nice and did a good job. The only thing I noticed that I feel like I paid a lot for just a simple manicure/pedicure. As a California native, I'm accustomed to the difference in prices comparing good work to amazing work. I've had amazing work done in Cali for prices a little lower. I'm still new to the area so I'm trying to find that Bingo Nail Salon....However, T2 did a good job...I guess I'm just picky! But overall a good job.
5 I found this place a year ago and I must say I have tried about six other places in the area and this is by far the best one I have found!! They do a great job on shelak you may have to wait because they are very busy all the time but it is worth the wait! A little pricey but all and all I will always come back!!!
