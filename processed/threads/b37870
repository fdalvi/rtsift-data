4 Everything the last woman said is 100% true but, Clarence Vastine MD works for Megan and he is awesome. I HATE Dr.'s with a passion, but he is an informative and knowledgeable Dr. The staff is horrible but once you get past them Dr. Vastine is great. I have been to dozens of Dr.'s in the past 2 years and 90% of the ones I've been to have HORRIBLE staff, so you just have to find a good Dr. you like. Dr. Vastine comes highly recommended by me!
1 If I could give zero stars I wow. All the other reviews are spot on. I went with my mom to her first appointment, she has multiple medical issues and because it was her first appointment she wanted to make sure that her new pcp had all her history. After discussing one issue my mom wanted to go over other medical issues and she was advised that she only made the appointment for one specific issue so they would not be able to discuss anything else. We found this to be rude but thoughat maybe this was the process for the office in a city since we are used to small town treatment. My mom has gone back multiple times to give it a chance but today was the final straw. She needed to have some prescription s filled but was told that they didn't have time to discuss those she would need to schedule a follow up appointment. Are you kidding me? Don't waste your time because it will just be follow up after follow up and nothing will be resolved. The entire staff is rude.
