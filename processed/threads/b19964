5 Yes, I was a tourist and I guess that probably makes this review garbage but I loved this place. We first walked in to just have a pint or two and didn't plan on staying long at all. After about 15 minutes, one of the regulars came up to us and just started talking to us, then inviting us over to his group. Well a couple pints turned into lots of beer and scotch over 2 visits during my trip to Edinburgh.   Sure, the pub is a fairly standard pub but the people were great. If I find myself back in Scotland, I will be sure to go out of my way to have a pint here again.. And talk trash about England.
