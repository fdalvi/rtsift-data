1 This is another bottom feeder collection law firm who only works for homeowners associations and makes their money by pursuing leans against honest homeowners who were the victims of bylaws or administrative errors by their clients, the homeowners associations.    If you happen to be in their office in person, check them for a pulse because these guys are heartless.  What a bunch of obstinate douche bags!
1 These people are the worst.  They get a little power over you and they treat you like garbage!!!  They are like Nazis!!  Just mean for no reason.  I hate dealing with them.  Curt and impersonal.  Avoid at all costs!  They like to call themselves a law firm, but they are a collection agency with absolutely no personal touch.  They obviously do not depend on repeat business from anyone they deal with and they show it.  I have never written a review before, but I was compelled to after my last phone call with Christine.  Good luck!
1 Horrible to work with and very rude. Paid my account in full and in trying to get a notice of zero balance from they instead was told that I would need to wait two weeks for them to "processes my payment". I was also told that my account was not time sensitive and they had other more important clients to deal with and I would just have to wait. When I asked why it would take so long i was told that the conversation was over and was hung up on.These people are rude, not true to their word, and difficult to work with when it doesn't involve them making money. They have my money and wont work me any longer. STAY AWAY FROM THEM AT ALL COSTS!!
1 Is this one of those law firms that represent HOAs that want to threaten owners?
1 Perfect example of why this countries judicial system is a joke. These lawyers are a fine example of corruption as they make their money off of honest home owners and crooked HOA's. I suggest an honest lawyer look into their records and sue them.
