4 I don't know why, but I absolutely love walking into this theater. Looking around, I can hear "HOLLywoooood...." I really don't know what it is... the staircases, the crowds of people running around, the bright lights everywhere. But it's cool.   Never had a problem here, always got tickets fast at the box office or at self-service. Long lines at concession, but they seem to move quickly. Sure, there's popcorn and crap all over sometimes, but at a late Saturday show, what do you want?   Only negative is about these people who bring their newborn-to-preschool age children to rated R, or really late movies. It rips my heart out to hear "I'm scared, Daddy!" or listen to a parent scolding their kid for whining about being tired, and really makes me regret the $9.50 I spent plus $4.50 drink, when I get to hear a baby crying right through the dialogue. I know, I sound callous and I could go complain. I understand, yeah, maybe you couldn't get a sitter. Sometimes, neither could I. Know what I did? STAYED HOME.
4 The best thing about this place are the seats and the openness of the theater is almost like walking into a mansion. ( not that I've ever been in a mansion before. wait... I take that back. Does the White house count as a mansion?)   Anyway, The staff are nice and friendly. The popcorn is good but I wish they served coke zero.
3 The inside is nice and clean because everything is new, but a few weeks back I stopped by with some friends to see Get Smart (after seeing the giant billboard on the side of the entrance) only to be informed that they were not showing that movie (this being a week after it was released)  Was the movie that much of a flop?  No.  AMC is not showing that movie due to some sort of contractual exclusivity agreement.  Then why, we asked, was there a 50 foot poster on the side of the building advertising this movie that snubbed this movie watching establishment?? The answer was "We don't put those signs up there, someone else does".  It made my brains hurt.
4 This is my go-to theater.  There are ones closer to my house, but I make it a point to drive a little further to go to this one.  The Pros: **Great stadium seating **Reclining chairs **DIY butter station for popcorn with many seasonings **Online ticketing and ticket kiosks so you don't have to wait in line **$5 movies for show times before noon **Early show times for the early bird (really early, like 845 am)  The Cons: **Parking is hit or miss **When movies are almost out of the theater they play them in these tiny theaters upstairs and if you get a bad seat, your screwed **Typical teenage workforce **Every once in a while they won't get a popular movie that is out and I have to go somewhere else  All in all, it's a great theater and there is a lot of good food and drinks in the Westgate area, so it's good one stop shopping.
4 I went here specifically to see Avatar in RealD (theatre 4). I may return to see it in IMAX Digital 3D, just out of curiosity.   Theatres are nice. Auditorium 4 is a bit small  (seats 169 screen estimated to be 43' Wide *31' H by counting ceiling tiles) if you are watching Avatar (which is why I will goto AZ Mills IMAX to compare visuals). Concessions are cool - you can grab yer own candies and pay for them at usual way-too-high theater pricing - but concession staff at least points out that if one person is ordering an ICEE and popcorn that they do have a two-ICEE deal that includes free popcorn (which wasn't that great, but I could put on my own butter flavoring NOT REAL BUTTER). I also noticed by the butter flavor dispenser they have single-serve jalapenos in little cups you could grab if u had a hot dog or nachos...very cool.  Place is clean, and new. Ticketing via online purchase and picking up at kiosk is ultra-smooth. Save the service charge by joining movieWatcher club.  Screen could be bigger (I say that about most theatres) and sound is not THX certified, nor were there any Dolby, SDDS, or DTS logos that highlighted its capabilites before the show. The movie itself, which sported both Dolby and DTS logos (can't remember if there was a SDDS logo) in the credits and was mastered at Skywalker Sound was not overly impressive in the audio department. Standard digital surround. Whatever...  Real D is an impressive format using what I am guessing was a single Sony projector. 2k? 4k? Not sure. Some parts could have been a tad brighter, but the blacks were awesome. Some of the oranges were a tad blown out, but that could have been by design.  I'll definitely hit this up again when I want to see something in RealD. Film was clean, no visual artifacts, no dust.   IMAX here seemed a tad too small for my IMAX tastes when I peeked in the theatre - but I expected that. Theatre staff told me that while the IMAX is currently 2K digital - they are going to 4K soon. I'll check it out then vs IMAX AZ Mills (film).
3 Went to see Edge of Darkness on Sunday afternoon.  I've been to this theater a few times.  What I remembered right away is that they are several dollars more than the other AMC's in the area or the Harkins. What's up with that?  Edge of Darkness is almost out of the theaters and that is why we went there before it's gone for good.  Our movie was upstairs.  I expected it would be in one of the smaller theaters, but the full capacity seating was 49.   Yes....49 seats and half the room is empty with no seats.  So if you like sitting really close to the screen, that's what it's like in these tiny viewing rooms.  Also, the concessions downstairs was really jammed, so we thought the concessions would be open upstairs on a busy Sunday afternoon. Wrong...they weren't.  They expect you to slep your popcorn and drinks up the stairs....  On the plus side....the movie was great, glad I got to see it, the seats were roomy and comfortable.  Would I go back?  Sure, but I'd check out the other AMC's or Harkins first.  Why pay more for the same movie?
2 All in all I wasn't impressed with this theater.  My best friend (a guy) took me here so we could both see Avatar at the IMAX 3D.  We stroll through the doors laughing & talking while making our way to the counter to buy tickets. Wait, there's no 1 buying tickets & the 2 people behind the counter are turned away doing something else.  We pause in confusion & look around feeling a little lost. Oh, you're supposed to buy tickets from these things on the wall now? Alrighty then, we can do that.  We fiddle with a touch screen machine for a minute or so before we figure out they only take credit cards. WTF?  My friend is frustrated by now & I think was starting to entertain the thought of leaving. I'm not giving up that easily though!  I drag my friend over to the counter & get the attention of the girl there. I explain that he doesn't want to pay with a credit card & would like to pay with cash. She sells us our tickets.  My poor friends' eyes practically bugged out of his head when he heard the price. Was it really over $25 for 2 people to see a movie?! Did I hear that correctly?  Anyway, she hands us these big ugly black glasses while I wonder how people paying with the machines get theirs. I also wet wiped my (uncomfortable) glasses before the movie because I just don't know how AMC disinfects them between people.   Were we really in an IMAX theater? The screen looked about the same as any other.
2 Some friends and I went to see "She's Out Of My League" during prime viewing hours so one would think that they'd at the very least devote a large theater for a popular just released movie on a Saturday night at 9 PM. We ended up in the smallest theater I've ever stepped foot in. A glorified home theater. Of course because of the conditions I previously mentioned it was uncomfortably packed, very obvious they oversold because every seat was filled and yet people were standing. The only seats we could find were up in the front where you had to nearly break your neck so that you could see the screen.  Just a poor layout and poor scheduling. Of course movie theaters are always a pretty standard experience where ever you go, but the management here needs to put some more thought and consideration into their actions.
3 Nice layout, wide berths.  Well-lit and clean.  Only complaint was that the women's restroom reeked of urine.  Took Mom to see a couple of 3D movies here last night ("How to Train Your Dragon" and "Alice in Wonderland"- both are EXCELLENT!  Very entertaining and great fun to match the actors w/ the characters' voices!)    How is it that the playback of 3D movies hasn't been perfected, yet?  We were going to see "Clash of the Titans," and after 20 minutes of trying to fix the defect (we couldn't even view the 3D previews), management decided to cancel the viewing and gave us all passes- a relief since many in the audience were demanding free HOTDOGS.  Free hotdogs??  C'mon people!  Hotdogs cost only $5, if that!  Just sit tight, keep cool minds and be patient, and management usually will resolve the situation w/ a FREE PASS to see ANY MOVIE.  Yes, even 3D movies ($13.75 here at Westgate).  I've been to AZ Mills Harkins 3D IMAX and the movie didn't start up correctly, either.  I also received free movie passes there, too.  (Hotdogs?  Really?  That's like using a complimentary drink coupon worth $8 to buy a bottle of beer or a glass of house wine that costs less than $5...)  BTW, 3D at AMC, at least at Westgate, is much better than 3D Harkins, but maybe that was bec. I saw such fun films last night and the movie I saw at Harkins ("Avatar 3D" in Dolby 3D) was such a letdown compared to the 3D IMAX version I saw at AZ Mills.  Hmm... I'll need more research.
1 We went there on Sunday night. We usually love going to Westgate Center to get a drink and appetizer and window shop a bit before going to the movies. I could not believe how disgusting that place was. The bathroom was so gross! Toilet paper all over the floors, and the mirrors looked like they had not been cleaned in a long time! No paper towels to dry your hands, either. I had to go out to the popcorn area for paper towels! The butter stations were just as bad! They had not been wiped down at all. There was food & oil all over the place. I mean, seriously, we are talking a Sunday night when it was dead in there!! Employees were standing around talking to each other! I was so turned off by the mess, that I will avoid going to that theatre again. It's a shame, since that is a nice area, with good restaurants and shopping.
1 The bathroom and elevator were soooooo dirty. We tried to play the arcade while we waited for the movie to start and all the machines were broken. Not impressed at all
2 I recently moved to the area of Westgate AMC and, even though it's not the closest, I thought I would give it a try. It's probably one of the most beautifully laid out and convenient movie houses I've been in. And for the first several visits, I didn't have too much of a bad experience. In fact, the only thing wrong was the ticket machines outside were down - apparently, I've heard that happens a lot, if they've ever worked.  This last trip was just plain bad. I went to see Piranha 3D and the 3D screen was fairly small, especially for a wide release on opening night. The 3D was off a bit, but then that might be this old person's eyes; I could see shadows and lines behind some of the target objects.  I arrived 45 minutes early and I mistakenly thought I would be too late to get a good seat for a 6:30 PM showing. By all means, I was approximately 30 minutes too early. They booked the showings way too close. The previous showing's credits ran until about 6:10, and then they, as always, took their time to clean out the theater. Once in, finally, the theatre was almost pitch black aside from dim lights on the staircases. The Pre-Show countdown, which I normally despise, would've been welcome, if just for some light. Well, that's why God made cell phones.  Upon finally sitting, there were two soda pop cans in the two cup holders - way to go, clean-up crew. I literally saw 7 people leave the theatre when that showing ended. Cleaning up should've been quick so you can continue your discussion about who's ID you'd use to go out that night.  But I digress, the soda pop cans were obviously not sold by the world's slowest concession employees. I just moved them over and the lights finally came on a bit roughly 7 minutes before the show. Typically, I hate when people have their cell phones lit up in the theatre, as they always want to hold them up high so the entire rest of the theatre gets the pleasure of the bright light while they babble on their ancient MySpace account. But, in this case, it's understandable as no one could see anything.  Question, and I've always wanted to ask this, are the employees at the concession stand told to go as slow...as...possible? Fine, I know they're not - I'm a former AMC employee and I wasn't. Although, the pennies they generously give in the paychecks might not put the right fire under them. But seriously, it's already an insult that we have to pay about $13 just for one popcorn and one soda, but they add the salt, on the wound, that is, by making us wait 20 minutes in a line of 3 people.  By God, I wish someone would open a concession stand with somewhat good deals - yeah, I know that's how they get their money, blah, blah, and I wish someone would open at least an express lane. "Two Items or Less Lane! No Children!" Heaven.  Really, movies are still relevant, even in a down economy. Perhaps you should hire less and pay more. I'm sure the one guy at the box office would've appreciated that.
4 This is my 2nd time to this AMC.  I like it!  It is huge and clean.  The wait for tickets were quick and they have it set up that it is a hotel check in.  Not behind a bullet proof pawn shop set up.  LOL!  The concession area was huge with mutliple lines open.  Not much of a wait either.    Walked into theater #10, not too shabby.  Pretty big screen and clean seats.  The speakers sounded great.  I had a great time.
2 A large AMC theater with somewhat reasonable prices (compared to Harkins and UltraStar).  The snack bar however is a different insult entirely..."movie nachos"  = $7+.  WOW!  Are they proud of those nasty stale nachos or what?  And for that $7+ purchase you only get one thing of fake cheese?  Cmon AMC!  This should be considered a criminal enterprise charging that much money for nasty nachos.    Anyways, this location does not lack parking or places to eat before or after the movie.  Just be wary of the criminal and insulting prices at the snack bar.  Really uncool prices in fact.  Enough to make me bring in my own "movie nachos" at a fraction of the price.
2 Two stars because the manager gave me free movie passes and a couple of free snack coupons to make up for my CRAPTASTIC movie-going experience.  Two adult tickets for a non-matinee is nearly $20.  The snack bar will hit you for another $25 if you take a man (or individual - mine happened to be male) who eats anything with you.  We were EARLY for our movie.  Chose our end-seats toward the back.  All is well even though everything is overpriced.  (Waaaaay more than H-word.)    Four adult women came and sat behind us during the previews.  They started talking.  They kept talking.  I gave them the courtesy "look."  So did my husband.  Kept talking.  I got up and alerted a manager.  Came back.  An usher came in and supervised for a minute.  He left, they started talking - AGAIN.  This went on for 1.5 hours into a two-hour movie (Unknown, which is GREAT from what I could hear of it!)  We escalated from looks to "Shhhhs" to shut up to "Oh my GOD!" to "I am going to go get the manager and you will be removed."  Well, I SLAMMED my fist into my popcorn bag to indicate to them I WAS going to get the manager.  I told the manager what was going on and... NADA!!!!!  Didn't throw them out.  Didn't really seem that apologetic.  Just went through the motions of the tickets and the stuff...  I would have rather enjoyed the last 30 minutes of the movie and taught the b&t#hes a lesson.    Don't go expecting back-up on the teeny-bopper texting crowd or hoping to get any results from on disrupters.  Just plan on watching the same movie twice.   From here on out, I do Harkins.
5 I've always been partial to Harkins Theaters because they have the best seats.  I used to say, "You know what would be the best theater?  AMC experience, with Harkins seats.."  Guess what.. AMC Westgate is the birth of the spawn of just that.  I love this place.  It's frigging massive to start with and has everything inside it.  Not to mention an IMAX.  The experience is great and the chairs are super comfortable.  Nothing really more to say that it's a theater.  I do like the new Stubs card that they put out.  Yeah it sucks that you have to pay for it, but it's only $12 a  year.  Not bad for all the free stuff you get.  Another cool thing about this theater is the location.  If you are going to grab dinner/lunch before hand, ther eis a ton of places to choose from.  Nice work AMC on making a great theater!!  Ohhh big big big heads up.  Be sure to see a movie before Noon or ya get to pay nice big money.   that's probably the draw back.  I'll still give you 5 stars.
3 I love AMC, always have.  My favorite location is the Deer Valley 30 location but this one is a close second.  It's far from perfect, in my opinion it could be kept a little cleaner and the staff could use a smile from time to time.   Over all though it's easy to get it get your tickets and concessions and get to your movie.  They run on schedule, I've never had a problem with having to wait longer then I should for a movie to get started.
5 Did the Imax experience.. Wow!! All the staff was great here and the place was clean even the restrooms..
4 Oh wow is this place huge. The ticket collector person fails to mention that screens 20 - 1,000,000 are upstairs, and what they also fail to mention, where the stairs are located. My friend and I walked around the entire first floor, not knowing where in the world carmen sandiego was exactly, and then noticed the large staircase. ONLY after the mile walk around the first floor, and locating the stairs on our own, were we told, "the stairs to the second level are here" well I'll be, Mr failed to mention that 10 hours ago ticket collector!
3 I wasn't happy to pay $14 for a IMAX movie and $5.75 for a large coke icee. There goes my entertainment budget for the year. Get the same coke icee at Circle K for $.79 CENTS.  Seats a lil tight, but I'm a lil big. soooooo we'll let that one slide Oh yea, some people kept letting their phone ring. Who doesn't put their phone on vibrate in a movie theatre? theatre was large, movie was great (Super 8)
4 Probably the best AMC Theater in the valley because you got the rest of Westgate to hang out at after the movie.
3 This was my first visit to this particular AMC as a whole AMC is alright with me, liked them better when they had the free rewards card. Why they ended that program I will never know. Anyway this particular location seems fairly nice, clean, and spacious. I was carded at the register getting my free ticket for a rated R movie. Mind you I'm 25 years old. I'll take it as a compliment. Unless that's just their policy to card. Overall it was a great experience.
4 This is a nice theater, only came here for a special engagement showing of the 25 anniversary of the Phantom of the Opera. Had a very good time, seats are very comfy, had enough leg room. Popcorn was very good, prices are a little steep, but almost all theaters are. I will return only when I need to. I still love our local place in Surprise.
4 All of my experiences at the AMC Westgate 20 have been good. The staff is friendly and nice. Audutorium's #9, #8, #1, and #16 are HUGE! The stub's card is a great deal. And on the weekends if you go to a showing before noon it's only 5 dollars. My only complaint is that the IMAX screen isn't as big as other IMAX theatres I've been to before.
4 It is hard to say anything negative about a movie theater unless the place is just disgusting, but the theater was clean and the staff was friendly.  No complaints.
4 Need to work on customer service at the front desk.
4 We got to watch The Avengers preview this morning!  (nah, nah, nah!)  :-)  The movie showed in the Imax theater here.  It was my first movie at this location (we live in Gilbert, if it wasn't for the free preview I would not come this far for a theater).  The theater clearly is not an original IMAX.  Comparing to the one at Arizona Mill makes that clear.  The screen isn't as big, and the seating not as vertical.  But it was a close approximation here at Westgate.  There was plenty of leg room.  If someone needed to get by there was no need to stand up and have your seat retract to let them by.  The seats were comfortable, the sound system was good, and the screen was respectable (smaller than true IMAX, but still very good).  The concession stand is fine.  It would be nice if they offered seasoning for the popcorn.  I've been in several theaters that offer this now, so you can flavor your popcorn to be like kettle corn (for example).  If you get it here, skip the butter.  It's not really butter, and not very good.  At least I didn't like it (and I usually like it).  All in all, a solid theater.  If it were closer I'd come here again.
5 Alwaya freindly, clean, and comfortable sits.
4 Certainly one of my favorites AMCs! The environment and interior of the theater is most certainly not conveyed by its exterior. On the outside, it looks like any other AMC, but once you walk inside it's a totally different experience. Very modern and inviting. The box office is inside so there's no "putting your face to the window to see show times" complete with the kiosks to the right. The concession stand signage is all digital and reminded me of the Dine-in AMC near the Biltmore. AMC has been doing a great job re-branding and it shows in the Westgate location. The service was a little slow on a Saturday at the concession stand, but nothing to complain over. Just like any other AMC, make sure you get there in enough time to get your snacks and find a seat. Good job, AMC!
4 I love their cheap morning movies! you guys rock
4 Reasonable prices, good service, over-priced snacks (like every other theater) and comfy seats! I do enjoy this AMC very much though when I have to come here versus the Harkins on Northern.  The one MAJOR drawback and this is a BIG WARNING is that if you go on the day of a Cardinals home game, EVERYONE and I do mean EVERYONE has to pay $10 to park in the parking lots at Westgate. The parking attendants will give you a ticket to take inside and AMC has a person there to give you back the $10 but the fact that you have to pay it to begin with sucks. What if I didn't have cash on me? This by no means is AMC's fault. I suspect it's the City of Glendale's or the Cardinal's convoluted way to soak people but at least you do get the money back if you are paying attention.
3 Been here many times. Never really had a complaint. But these are not as nice as the ones we have in LA.
4 Comfy seats that sit well above the next row, and plenty of legroom. In spite of that, though, the person behind me kept on bumping into my seat. Why? There was PLENTY of space! I'm almost 6'2", and my legs never came near the row in front of me! Not so with her!
3 Stadium seating is cool and it offers IMAX.  This is usually my go to movie theater on the west valley.
4 Love this location!
3 Was out at AMC Westgate to see a movie premier, and when I 1st walked in  I was like Wow this place is nice, liked the look of the spiraling stair case and thought to myself, this is a staircase you can see the Rockettes come down. Yes I know, it's not as classy, its AMC, but still when at the movie theater dream big baby!  The only issue that I had with AMC was the restroom, the floor was sticky gross, your shoes were stuck to it, the restroom its self, not kept clean, trash everywhere, I hate dirty restrooms, it's a pet peeve.   The lobby is decked out like most movie theaters, posters of current & upcoming movies, the concession stands looked bright & clean.
4 Very friendly staff. Came to see the Hobbit at 10PM on a Monday night. Almost no one there 'cause it was so late on a weekday so there wasn't much to observe. Very easy end of the night for the staff. I should probably go during peak to see how they are.
4 I like this theater quite a bit. Since it's not a giant megaplex, it's usually less crowded and chaotic, but it will almost always have what you want to see, even if it's only 20 screens.  The concessions are theater prices (so pretty expensive), but come on, would you expect anything less? Luckily their popcorn is good and they offer a different number of drink/popcorn/food combos.  The staff has always been friendly too, I've had no problems there. They're always ready to greet and help you out.  Overall, I think AMC Westgate 20 is a great place. Check this place out the next time you want to see a movie, you won't regret it.
1 Everytime my friends and I see a midnight here there always out of hot dogs and has stale popcorn. Also we seen a baby cockroach crawling on the counter. If there gonna do a midnight they should make sure they have everything ready. I'm paying the same price as everyone else who goes t earlier show.
5 I love this theater, I always come to this one even though its not the closest one to me. Friendly staff and they keep it CLEAN! Plus I don't feel like its a high school playground on the weekends. As far as pricing goes tickets are decently priced and they have deals for weekdays before a certain time and weekends before noon. I smuggle in candy so can't help with those prices but I know they're ridiculous like every other theater.
4 Clean, comfortable movie theater at the head of the Westgate entertainment district. I am not as big of a fan of the popcorn at AMC as I am of Harkin's. Nice proximity to several restaurants and bars so this AMC would be perfect for a date night.
3 I would say compared to other AMCs and movie theatres, it's about par.  We've been coming here for a few years now and like that it's in a shopping center area.  It's easy to just get a meal and then head to the movies!
4 For a $5.00 matinee ticket, absolutely zero complaints here. The theatre & restrooms were clean, (the gold standard in my book), the theater itself was a comfy temp.,didnt need the hoidie I carried in. I am not one to blow dough on concessions, so can't comment on their prices, but overall a great experience. The seats are roomy, floors non-sticky, & I will def. visit again.
4 Great theatre. Huge, clean $5 matinees. Good concession variety. I went to the Bring your Baby to the movies program 1st Tuesday of each month at noon at Westgate AMC sponsored by the Bump and was surprised to be the only mom there.   There were 2 other couples but no moms or kids.  Usher came in and gave me baby food as part of their giveaways but no low noise level or dimmed lights or changing area like babycenter.com and bump.com had mentioned there would be.   Either way it was great to feel welcome with a stroller although I'm not sure if the other couples knew they were in a theatre for moms and kids.   Hope they advertise this program more. I'm sure lots of stay at home moms would attend.
1 Do not go there! Ticket machines were out of paper so you couldn't use them and the ticket line was really long. The trash cans in the lobby were overflowing. There was no toilet paper, soap and paper towels in the woman's room. This place was a nightmare! I intend to contact AMC corporate & let them know how awful this theatre is managed.
4 Comfortable seats and clean
1 I'm not a fan of AMC at all. I always try to stick with Harkins, but I was forced to come here with friends on a Saturday night. If your a person who tries to buy locally, go to Harkins. Harkins is a local theater with their HQ in Scottsdale. AMC(American Multi-Cinema) is a subsidiary of a Chinese company. All that aside here is what I think.  Pros:  -Nice lobby/Interior -Nice surrounding area  Cons: -No military discount -No souvenir shirts or cups -Prices are terrible -Parking is a nightmare -Teenager hangout -Loud teenagers texting/talking in theater.
1 Theaters 17-20 are upstairs and only accommodate 49 ppl, they will sell all seats so if you come with a date you will not get a good seat Lines long for concessions, employees 16yrs old, walking around and incompetent
1 No, no, no. NO.  I went to see Superman recently. The showing was at 10:45 or something late like that. Anyways, I had THE WORST movie experience EVER. Let me tell you about it.  I brought about 10 people with me and we were REALLY excited about the movie. There was a girl sitting two seats away from me with a 3 or 4 year old little girl. (at 10:45pm? Come on) The little girl was running around the theater, going up to everyone and talking, dropping things, spilling drinks, etc... So the mom gives her an iPad and turns the volume up really loud... It's crazy bright and loud and SUPER distracting. It kept yelling out "STRAWBERRY" "GOOD JOB!" "DINOSAUR!" Guys, this went on the ENTIRE MOVIE! But this wasn't my main problem... Kids are kids and you really can't blame Westgate for bad parents and rowdy kids.  I got up to go tell someone that something needed to be done, I couldn't take anymore.  I WALKED AROUND FOR 30 MINUTES AND DIDN'T FIND ONE PERSON TO TALK TO! I was banging on doors that said "employees only", I was yelling asking if anyone was around... No one was anywhere! After 30 minutes a security guard comes around (I felt SO safe... not) and was able to track someone down.  When I told the manager that there were incredibly distracting people in the theater and asked for my money back, she got really annoyed and gave me a free pass.  That was my problem... There was no one around for way too long and then they got mad at ME... They had an opportunity to fix a bad experience and only made it worse.  I will never come back here again. Screw Westgate. NEVER AGAIN!  Oh and $6 for a kids popcorn? Are you kidding me?!
4 the only theater i go to since moving to arizona i go about 3 times a week if you like quiet mon-thur are your days fri-sun are the busy days it's clean for the most part i suggest if you go frequently you get a stubs card
1 We asked if they had a student discount and they replied " this isn't Harkins". We should have walked out the door, our mistake. Had to use the restroom...every stall was disgusting paper everywhere, just gross. The theater was upstairs, concession stand closed upstairs, no biggie, we got our popcorn downstairs. They were right this isn't Harkins, no selection of seasoning for the popcorn...bummer. We got to the "theater", it was very small, the screen was a joke and the movie started 20 minutes after it was supposed to, just sat there watching a bunch of previews.
4 Just saw Gravity on their IMAX screen.  Sound was great and the theatre clean.  Nothing extraordinary, you get the normal over priced theatre snacks.  The best part is all the restaurants and shops around it.  Within a few blocks you can shop the outlet mall, eat at BWW, and catch a Cardinals game.
5 We Come here to enjoy the movies that we REALLY want to see, they place is so clean. i like the crowds here because if you are watching a funny movie you can hear the whole place covered in laughter and i like laughing along with other people that enjoy a certain movie...not much annoying texters or phone callers so that's a plus...alot of people are courteous when they have crying babies and they go outside which is cool because the rest of us want to enjoy the  movie. the food is a little pricy but then again arent all movie theaters like that?
3 I come here a lot. Like that they have cheap matinees and offer a variety at snack bar. Like that they have the automated ticket machines.
3 Usually a good experience.  Appropriate sound levels and the staff was polite.  The theatres' seats were a little uncomfortable.  Keep in mind that a 7:05 movie actually starts at 7:25 due to previews and AMC ads.  Last time I went the crowd groaned on the sixth preview.  Going to the theatres was a treat but today all the little irritants, whether it's the company or motion picture industry, have worn down the enjoyment.
5 Love this theatre I've been coming here since they opened. Never a disappointment it's always clean and the customer service is always on top of its game. Love being able to walk around west gate and shop or eat before or after a movie as well. I would recommend this theatre to anybody.
5 First of all, I really love AMC theaters! I am a Stubs account holder and I will never go back to Harkins so long as there is an AMC with the movie time that I need. This location is huge and it is rarely ever crowded. With its close proximity to great restaurants (Yard House and Buffalo Wild Wings are our faves), it makes the perfect spot for date night.
2 One of the worst movie theaters in town. The employees are pretty brisk and rude. The seats are so uncomfortable and the auditoriums are often left uncleaned. On top of that, they really are packed sometimes and make the unwise decision of placing popular hits in awkward barely THX rooms
3 i love Amc, but the staff here is a bit rude and when purchasing tickets messed up and had to get refund and get the right ticket. other than that there arcade is decent but every game is 4 tickets. not too many games, and the air hockey was missing a slider thing. movie was good. and Amc is amazing but need to rethink there staffs. no smiles no happiness from them.
3 5 dollar movie, big chairs, empty theater.  Great place to watch a matinee.  No one was here so it was pretty nice having the theater to your self.  Only thing I don't like is their popcorn.  I wish they would use real butter and not the oil crap that squirts out of a fountain.  You can't get the middle or bottom, you get a greasy mess on the top.
3 The management isn't big on making sure the theater is glean. The only seats that were left is full of trash. Well that's movies today for you.
1 Everytime I go to this theater there are always noisey Mexicans that wont shut the fuck up, or that have kids talking through the entire movie, last time I almost got into a fight with someone sitting behind me cuz they couldn't control their kids!  I'll stick to going to harkins
2 Been coming here since they opened , over the last year or so this place has slowly declined in cleanliness,customer service, and overall movie experience . The prices are super high for what you get which unless you ask for light ice is a cup full of ice with a shot of your favorite soft drink.  These people really need to step up to the plate and work on customer service skills, and instead of texting while working clean the place !!!
4 AMC is pretty consistent theater chain and this location is no exception.  Located in the Westgate Shopping complex, this AMC offers up 20 screens which means plenty of showtimes an a wide selection of movies. Coming in, the lobby is huge with a concessions area to match. The theater is pretty clean and well maintained. Seats are comfortable, though I am sure they are going to upgrade them to the la-z-boy style reclining seats.  $5 weekday matinees are a great deal and get even better when you got a stubs card. They offer great deals as well on private screenings and birthday parties as well.
