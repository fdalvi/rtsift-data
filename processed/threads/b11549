4 For those that may be new to Pt's it's you classic neighborhood pub that can be found in almost any Vegas neighborhood.   I'm found of this Pt's because of its close proximity to my house, shuffle board, good bar food, pool tables, and bar staff.
5 The best hangout in the Silverado Ranch area by far!  We recently moved about 25 minutes away, and although we drive past at least a half dozen other places on our way, we still come back.  They have pool tables, darts, plenty of room for large groups and a comfortable seating area in addition to a spacious bar area.  The food is great and the service is spectacular. If you're looking for a nice hangout where everyone knows your name, it"ll only take one visit to this location to have you hooked.  Gamers? This is the place that respects you! Laminated signs on each machine inform you as you sit down that this space is reserved for gamers. Bartenders will gladly relocate someone who just wants to sit and watch tv so that a gamer make take that spot. FANTASTIC! This is how it should be done everywhere.  My only complaint? Lose the internet jukebox. Go with a nice neutral sattelite radio station or something.
4 good PT's like it much more than other PT's on Silverado Ranch Blvd.
5 Mr Anderson rocks.  Food is pretty good for bar food.   Unfortunately I never win on their games :(
4 Service is great and very welcoming. Came here yesterday to see the Steelers, Go STEELERS!, pre season football game. Place is spacious and nice with an area of pool tables, games and big screen tvs everywhere. Literally, I was here for only 10 mins, since the steelers games was not showing, I was asked by 3 bartenders at 3 different times if I needed anything to drink or eat. Love that the bartenders are attentive and cool. Can't wait to come back for more than 10 mins on my next visit to try the food.
5 I love it here. I feel right at home. It's never jam packed. They have amazing food and cheap happy hours daily from 4pm-7pm and 12am-3am. I go here about twice a week. Pool tables and dart boards are great too.
5 Great service and steve the bartenders alway cool.. Pool tables and dart boards well kept.
5 Great local bar & atmosphere. Steve the bartender always treats us great. Definitely worth the trip & they offer pool & darts. Great wings :)
4 Believe it or not, PT's has great food. Yes its a chain bar, but this chain bar actually has one of my favorite simple things to eat.  I order their Cobb salad and a bucket of chicken wings - crispy & dry. I get three sauces on the side: Buffalo Medium, Sweet Chile & Asian BBQ. Of course I do blue cheese dressing instead or ranch :)  The combination of the super fresh salad and the wings is deliciously good. Give it a shot!
1 Crappy service.  Dirty bathrooms. Bartender spent more time on her phone than interacting with customers.  Cold food brought out at separate times than my friends food.   This place is awful.  Go to the Lodge!
1 Beware of PT's ...... One star is to much for most locations, Crappy service.  Dirty bathrooms.  Cold food brought out at separate times than my friends food.   This place is awful.
3 Cool place to chill and have a few drinks and food.
1 Awful food and service! Food was cold and gross. Service was slow and she didn't seem to care at all. I will never go back with the intentions of eating.
4 Mikey pours the best 'Dirty Bong Waters' since the Redhawk. Always takes care of his customers. Steve's pretty good too, when he actually works ;)
4 I've been to a few PTs around town and this one is one of my favorites. Not only because it's a block from my house, but because it's clean, the staff is friendly and efficient and there's not a whole bunch of weirdo/creepers everywhere.   Nothing fancy about PTs. Just a great local hangout with cheap drinks. I'm not too fond of the food here. It's your basic bar food, nothing extravagant. Burgers, fries and pizza. I do, however, like the pretzel bites even though I know they aren't made fresh. Drinks are made pretty well. Some of the bar tenders are a little heavy handed, but no complaints there.  The staff is great here. All the girls have been super nice. Once I came here after work by myself for a quick night cap. One of the male bartenders saw that I was receiving unwanted attention from one of the other guests at the bar. The bartender (forgot his name) pretended that we were really good friends and kept chatting with me so that the guy would leave alone. I guess that's what happens when I choose to come alone, but whatever. Really great of him to save me from that. Great bar and staff!!
4 Visited for lunch today. We ordered the chicken quesadillas & the grilled chicken sandwich. Food was delicious, generous portions & service was friendly.
4 Carrie and Gina are the best bartenders
5 This is my favorite PTs on this side of town! The bartenders are cool, the mugs are frosty- plus half off drinks from 5-7pm after work, I'm there! The bartenders are the best too, they're all so nice!
4 Great neighborhood bar with a variety of beers on tap. Not fond of their food so that's why all I do is drink there! Mikey on grave is the best bartender. The main reason we keep going back there is him!
2 Ok this is no longer my favorite PTs. I would come here after work to relax and enjoy a drink. I don't have that same enjoyment of this place anymore.  Rewind back a few months. My bf and I came here one night for a few drinks. I order a Bellini, which is champagne and peach pur√©e. The bartender Carla didn't know what that was and made this face like I was making up some absurd drink. It's a typical champagne cocktail! And plus you're a bartender, you're supposed to know your drinks. She knew what a mimosa was when I ordered it, she should have known what a Bellini was. Anyway, about 10 minutes later, my bf accidentally knocked over my drink shattering the glass on the floor. We thoroughly apologized and I understand that Carla was annoyed she had to clean it.   Now fast forward to our visit last night. We order a beer from this one blonde bartender. Really nice and inviting. We were enjoying our time. Then Carla comes over and says to my bf "do you want another beer?" Then he answered "sure I'll take another one." Then she replies with "what is it?" Um rude!!! My bf said she probably remembered us from the glass breaking incident, which is why she have us attitude. Anyway, after that I was just in a fowl mood and we left shortly after.   Looks like I won't be going to this PTs anymore. There's another one down the street from us so it's not like I'm going out of my way.
3 Great neighborhood bar! The bartenders are friendly!  Loved the pretzel bites!
