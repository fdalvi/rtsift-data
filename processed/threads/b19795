1 well, where do I begin...my move from phoenix to chicago took place on april 16 and they lost 3 of my very expensive bikes along the way. Ill finish my review once they actually get back to us with the "extra" insurance we paid for to cover for replacement. Oh and by the way today is may 4....and they have not called us once. We keep calling and getting the run around. My finished review will take place after we see how they take care of our stolen bike issue.
1 This is the worst company and the worst exp I have ever had. Save yourself being over charged and damages to your furniture. I will never use this company again! If i could give them no stars I would.
1 The movers did a fairly good job, but did dent a piece of furniture and caused damage to the new frame on the front door. I referred my parents to use your services two weeks later; mainly due to the pricing I received.  They were thinking of going to another company; as they were not impressed with my move.  However, I persuaded them.  On the day of their move, I found out they were not offered the same pricing I received.  I asked that my pricing be honored due to the fact that I referred them and it was on the same day of the week and a similar move.  The owner was very rude.  The mover had him on speaker phone and he was unprofessional.  The mover asked again about honoring the pricing due to being disconnected the first time and he replied in an elevated and abrupt tone of voice "I already told her NO!!" I will never utilize their services or refer anyone again.
