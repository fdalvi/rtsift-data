4 Last night we went to the Highley Center for Performing Arts to see the Nutcracker by the Southwest Youth Ballet Company.  The performance was lovely, and the costumes were beautiful.  The center was clean, easily accessible, and overall comfortable. A wonderful evening for the whole family.
3 It is a nice auduitorum, we came for a dance recital and it was a nice area.
4 This is a beautiful venue. It is truly a treasure in our community and should be attended by more members of the community! The seats are comfortable and having attended many many performances in both the Concert Hall and the Little Theatre I can say that there is not a bad seat in the house! Friendly staff and ushers too. HCPA is a hidden treasure that I hope more people find!
