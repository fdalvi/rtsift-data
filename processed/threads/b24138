5 Good price.. Clean water... Nice staff...  Our canoe tipped over and we were rescued by their Emergency Resonse boat team.  haha. Even though i tipped it over on purpose in the middle of the lake, it was still very courteous of them to keep an eye out...  I left my wallet, phone, and cash with the front desk, and I felt very comfortable leaving it with staff.  Not something i'd leave just anywhere.  Thanks everyone there!
5 How great to have an affordable boat rental right by our home. And you can rent a pontoon boat!! Great lake. Great boat house with snacks, bathrooms. Excellent sailing instruction. Fun place.
5 The nicest staff. Good selection of rentals, and really knowledgeable suggestions on what to use.  Everyone around this place just seemed happy to be there!
