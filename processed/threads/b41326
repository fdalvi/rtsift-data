5 I have done many different workouts and I love this place.  The constant heart rate monitoring means you never "cheat" and the trainers and owner are great.  The workouts are never the same so it never gets boring and its like having group personal training without the cost of a trainer!!  Highly Recommend!
5 I've attended 6 workouts there so far and I feel great when I leave and I always really look forward to going back! The prices are very reasonable at $15 per session with a monthly package.  I do pilates 4 days a week, so the only day I get in my cardio is at OTF. Ricky has been my favorite instructor so far, helping me burn almost 500 calories per class! There is a free, easy to use app for your smart phone that allows you to schedule and cancel your session any time which is very convenient.  The thing that makes OTF so different from any class you will take at the gym or another small studio is that each person is given a Polar heart rate monitor which tells you how many calories you are burning along the way. It's displayed on a TV screen so you can watch it the whole time. The idea is to be in the "orange zone" about half your workout. The screen lets you know when you're there and motivates you to push harder when you're below orange.  I know it motivates me!  Side note: if you're a mom and your class starts after 10am, you can drop your kid off at Kinderland for $10/hour. It's in the same strip mall and is safe, clean, and fun!!!
