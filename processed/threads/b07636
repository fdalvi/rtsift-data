5 We finally found THE "Berto's" place for us in this neck of the woods (although it's technically not a Berto's... whatever...) Doesn't look like much on the outside, but the semi-crappy exterior usually speaks volumes about the food (in a good way)... there's something a little unsettling about a bright and friendly looking Berto's. ANYWAYS we went to this place last night. They had a lot of stuff on their menu that isn't on some other "Berto's" menus... like the 5 rolled taco supreme that my fiance got... rolled tacos, covered in everything that comes on super nachos (carne, sour cream, cheese, salsa... OH MY) - awesome. I got the bean and cheese burrito, which was also delicious. We'll definitely be back!
5 I have been coming to Ramiro's since last October when a friend of mine said, hey lets grab a breakfast burrito! OMG! it was so good! Packed full of yummy goodness to the point that I have been back many times just for the breakfast burritos alone. Fast track to their nachos, regular burritos, tacos, you name it, I have tried it and it was delicious. Like Ashley said, this place isn't a "Berto's" by any means, they are better! I have and will continue to come back for more!
4 We have enjoyed the last several times we ordered here.   We get the Bean and Cheese burros Super Nachos  Both have better taste then the bertos around the way.   Watch your drive thru though....missing items!
4 I was hungry and in the area during lunchtime.  After a quick search on the Yelp app, I found this place.  It's a dive Mexican joint offering street Tacos and Burritos.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the Prize Claw machine....these things are everywhere now, what's the deal with that?  Anyway, back to the food....since I'm rarely in this area I decided to try a couple of items:  Bean & Cheese Burrito, $3.75 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix-2?select=RRp-4xY9uBuTEliMx6JUVA#RRp-4xY9uBuTEliMx6JUVA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix-2?select=AowjfEJkRsLVmQqrZW4R9A#AowjfEJkRsLVmQqrZW4R9A http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix-2?select=Vv_y6-9lSKlBwAwULmgK0Q#Vv_y6-9lSKlBwAwULmgK0Q  Carne Asada Taco, $1.35 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix-2?select=Al2QHYAViDvTXh_hkFizQg#Al2QHYAViDvTXh_hkFizQg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix-2?select=lBu9D7gzrZfL8zLIwC-Ynw#lBu9D7gzrZfL8zLIwC-Ynw  The Bean & Cheese Burrito was very good.  The Tortilla & Beans tasted fresh and was not greasy.  The Tacos were simple street Tacos....Carne Asada Steak, Cilantro, Onions, Corn Tortillas....these were very good as well.  Overall, it's a pretty good Mexican food joint....wish it was closer to my neighborhood.  Return Factor - 87%
4 I'm sitting here stuffing my face with the rolled tacos supreme. Why didn't anyone think of this sooner? They are really really good. I was over at the dealership and looked on Yelp to find somewhere to pick up some food. I saw that this place only had 4 reviews, and Filibertos had 23. I think Fili's is...meh so I tried here instead. I was hoping for a drive thru, and got one. Can't rate it any higher because this is the only menu item I've tried. Very delicious though!
4 Food is pretty good but could use a bit more seasoning. Prices are what makes this place a good value. Could also use a good cleaning, especially in the restrooms.
4 Went on a late Saturday morning. Ordered a breakfast item - Chorizo Burro and a lunch/dinner item - Chili Relleno Plate. I wanted to see if it was worth the drive for future visits in one stop.  The chorizo burrito was very good. It has more seasoning than the "-berto" style joints in a 5 mile radius. I like this fact. WIll go back for breakfast. The Chili Rellenos were the same as the others. I would not go back for the rellenos...but the fact that the burro was so good I would try another menu item if I was in the area.
5 Super legit Mexican food. Better than other local chains ending in "o's".   Great prices. Regular chicken burrito is like $5.02 with tax.  Eat here about once a week for the past 6 months. Had about every burrito and platter on the menu. Can't really go wrong. Adobada is a little greasy for my taste but coworkers and friends have enjoyed it.  Personal favorite burritos: regular chicken, california.
