3 I don't know what it is, but when I walk past any Levi store I just can't get that Spaceman song from that advert out of my head, it just completely takes over and makes me forget what I'm looking for in the first place. Lucky then, the Levi specialise mainly in jeans so when I come back down to Earth is obvious what I'm looking for.   I own a few pair of Levi's and I like the cut of them, they always feel comfortable and the one's that I do have, I've had for years and they're still going strong. Recently though, I've found myself not really bothering with Levi, mainly because I can't seem to afford the prices and instead tend to go to Topshop or River Island for jeans instead.  Overall, I think Levi has always been better at catering for guys than girls and the 80:20 guys to girls clothing in this store reflects that. They have a great range for guys and they usually have offer on too and it offers more selection than the skinny jean offerings at nearby All Saints and Topman.
3 My father instilled an utmost respect of Levi jeans in me from a young age, and whilst I never buy their jeans anymore I'm just a big fan.  The store itself is quite bland in my opinion. I'm sure they were aiming for classy and minimalist, but I just find it bland. There's also the fact that no pair of Levi jeans has (flatteringly) made it past my bum since I was twelve.   The last time I snuck a peak at their collection, there weren't too many edgy or quirky designs, but I don't begrudge them sticking to their style; if you want the homeless look try All Saints, for example.   One thing that's a constant with Levi is the quality of their jeans, and from some detailed observation they look really good on guys!
