5 After the Sun Lakes True Value Hardware location turned a cold shoulder to me, this one pulled through, both in emails and in person.  I received the help I needed, found the product I was looking for, recommended by a teacher at a local craft store, purchased it, and left happy.  I wouldn't hesitate to go back here again!
5 I took a whole house full of screens to be re-screened. They were quick about the re-screening and very reasonable on cost. I will go back whenever I need hardware items. Becca was an angel.
