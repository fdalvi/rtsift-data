5 this is by far the best doctors office ive ever been to, and I have been to a ton! They are all so nice and willing to help with everything. They call me to remind me of stuff and i find that really helps me. I see amy steinhoff and she is THE BEST!!! I love this place (considering its a dr office haa)
5 Truly a 5 Star medical center.  Dr.Skelly  is my doctor.  However,  The staff there s so well run.  If your appointments at 3:00 that when you'll be seen!!  If you have an emergency they are so willing to let you see a PA or MA what ever you need unless of course that's the ER.   I saw a notation somewhere on this sight that said closing soon.  I sure hope that is for something other than the Medical Center!  They have a lab for blood and urin work ups.  This place is the best in facility, for treatment and patient consideration.!
