5 Was here on a Sunday afternoon a few weeks ago. They've got a couple of tables out on Rose St and a super comfortable set up indoors with sofas and reclining chairs. Their irish stew and vegetarian chili were delicious but we were here after running the half-marathon so I may have a biased opinion. Beers were good, they did Irish coffee and the wine kept us going a good long while. Well worth coming back to either for sitting outside and watching people (although it's a narrow street so no sunshine) or to chill out indoors on a Sunday afternoon.
