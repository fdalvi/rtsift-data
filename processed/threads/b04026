2 I think if you go to Arby's you know what you are getting into and compared to some of the other Arby's it's pretty good. Granted, it's never going to be perfect, this is fast good not fine dining.  I have received under cooked fried foods, and some dishes are overly spicy. Limit menu, i'd rather go else where, but for what it is, this place is decent.
4 What I like best about this location are the friendly people that work there. Very clean inside and out. Good location, good food served quickly with a smile. And they take gift cards :)
2 Worst customer service I have ever experienced at an Arby's. Maybe they were having a bad day?     Food was still good. Mountain Dew sucked though.
3 Went not expecting much as I have been to Arby's numerous times.  I went through the drive thru this time where I was greeted kindly, but the service was pretty slow.  The food was exactly what I expected, and my appetite was satisfied.  Recommend if you're looking for something other than your typical burger and fries.
