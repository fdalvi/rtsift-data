5 I have been shopping here for years! I love their clothes! They know what I like and call me when something comes in that is me! The employees treat me like family!
1 Clothes are as "low class" as the owner.......owner and employees make inappropriate/degrading comments about  customers when they leave, so be sure your "skin is thick."
1 The products are "low class," and so is the "supposed' Manager ( female in cahouts with the male  owner)..As soon as a customer leaves the store, the OWNER males SEXIST COMMENTS about the customer. they have a good laugh at your expense!..how pathetic!!!!!  Paradise Valley?...some hopes...how about "The Twilight Zone?"
1 be sure to take a look at filtered (out) reviews in the "about the business" section
