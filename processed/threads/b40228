5 Huge selection of flavors that are mixed fresh at the store. You can customize your flavors and create your own blends.  Good selection of Mods. The shop has a build station for those Vape-goers who enjoy building their own mechanical mods. Friendly, knowledgeable, down-to-earth owner.
5 Sky Vapors is a refreshing addition to the Las Vegas vaping scene. When I stepped into Sky Vapors I was greeted by the awesome owner Lonnie. He took the time to walk me through all of their custom blends and mods. Sky Vapors takes their shop a few step further, by providing a build station where you can build your own mods. I love that they display local artist work on the walls, that are actually available for sale! As a supporter of local artists and independently owned businesses this shop is right up my ally! Check it out, support your local artists and small businesses!
5 Friendly people, tons of flavors! They are super helpful with any questions you have. They will mix flavors for you however way you like, and they've come up with their own original mixes. "Horchata"? What?! Amazing!  Stop by and try it, and see what you like. Very affordable! I will definitely come back for refills!!!
5 Superb customer service. Prices are way better than competition. They take time to understand your wants, and strive to make it happen. They will also spend time explaining to you anything you need to know. I don't know what more they could do to service customers and provide great value. This is now my one and only vapor retailer. It's worth a drive across town if you don't live in the area. Give these guys a try, you will be very happy.
