5 Yet another new solid pizza place in Tempe that delivers to me. The "personal" pizza we had was like nearly 12 inches (we were expecting more like 8"), and a lot of bang for the buck. The cheesesteak we split was delicious. We also ordered some cheese bread, and it was pretty unique compared to what I'm used to. Also very good. The pizza was really flavorful and good, and we could tell the ingredients were all fresh.   Everything we had was great, and it arrived fast. The customer service here was super nice as well. I don't like using the word "cheap" when describing something that was both inexpensive and good, but really - the prices here are low for what you get. Great bargain. This location used to be a different pizza place, but after sitting empty for months, I'm glad to see a new tenant int he space. I'm double glad that the food worths.    When I first moved to this neighborhood a few years ago, there was only a handful of pizza places that delivered to me besides the Hut and Dom. Now there's a dozen or so local places offering pizza delivery... and a few dozen more offering all types of different cuisine. I love choices. If you're like me, you like to support local restaurants like this one. Do it.
1 Recently ordered a delivery for 3 sandwiches to my workplace with some co-workers. The delivery driver was over an hour late because he wasn't local and apparently didn't understand how to operate a GPS or why that might be relevant to his job description. Consequently, everything was room temperature and soggy. Additionally, apparently either this joint has some kind of avant garde art school sandwich shit going on, or everyone was too occupied with taking gigantic bong rips in the walk-in fridge, because all of the sandwiches lacked a top piece of bread. I have to admit, begrudgingly, that the ingredients in the sandwich itself were pretty good, but that doesn't really make up for the rest of this nonsense.  In short, I hope Nick's Pizza either shapes up fast, or suffers from a structure-leveling grease fire.
1 I ordered delivery because of the good reviews. I ordered garlic knots and a hawaiian pizza. When the food arrived, the garlic knots were stale and crunchy. I could not eat them. The pizza wasn't much better. The cheese was already rubberized andbthe grease soaked through to the bottom leaving a floppy, soggy crust. I wouldn't recommend eating this to anyone. It was one of those times that trying something new over the usual was a disaster.
2 This new pizza place is where Devil's Pizza Factory used to be. Receipts still say Devil's Pizza Factory on them in fact.  Unlike Devil's that made varying shades of bad to decent pizza for $6 a pie, this place makes bad pizza for $10-$13 a pie.  I ordered one of the 'special pizzas' and found that the dough was not particularly good and it really just tasted like salt. It also filled a napkin with grease that we dabbed off.  The in store service was very nice, but the pizza was not good enough to try again.
3 I'm not completely convinced yet.  I ordered for the first time tonight. I got a build your own slice of pizza and a Cesar salad.  While the ingredients were great on my pizza the crust was a bit soggy. They also forgot the ricotta that I ordered $.35 to add on my slice.  The sauce was meh... but not the worst I have ever had.  The salad's dressing tasted cheap and they added tomatoes (which was odd because it was a cesar salad).  The portion size was alright there was a fair amount of Parmesan and the croutons were good.  This place is new so there are probably some hiccups still.  It was an alright experience but I am willing to give them another chance.
4 I had the Italian sub !! Bread was good soft  I really enjoyed it. Also had some garlic knots that where hand mad by a very nice lady ,the pizza was ok ,dough was soso ,cheese was good and it had oregano  on top ,over all I would come back here the sub was very good and the garlic knots where fantastic ,pizza needed alittle more cook time ! have to try it again
5 This place was amazing everything tastes so fresh and delicious and I just loved the customer service they made me feel like I belonged there and like we were all family. I would go there any day of the week my family and I had an amazing time and I would so recommend this pizza to anyone I think that if you're used to Pizza Hut and little Caesars you need to wake up from that nightmare and try some real pizza. "Preach bitch"
5 We (our company) just started ordering from Nicks a few weeks ago, now I think someone orders at least every other day. We're so impressed with their customer service. The owners daughter is magnificent! She writes cute little comments on all the food which make everyone feel really special - its that special family touch that keeps us ordering from them  The food is great! their alfredo pasta and garlic knots are a huge hit around here!
1 Waited almost two hours for delivery on a Sunday night for an undercooked calzone paired with cold marinara sauce (must have just come out of the refrigerator). If you're going to take two hours, I expect good food.
2 I ordered a large cheese pizza and natural mini chicken spring roll.  Spring Rolls - 3/5 - Nothing special. Pizza - 2/5 -  Greasy. Tasted okay. I've def had worse, but this is far from great. Value - 2/5 - 25$ for the above and a drink. Not very worth it.  Overall, I am glad they delivered, but I won't be trying them again.
5 Was actually on my way to Buffalo Wild Wings nearby, but plans with some other people that I was gonna meet up with fell through, but I was starving and needed some place to go..... Nicks caught my eye and I figured I'd give it a try since I'd never been there before.   Got a very welcoming greeting from the staff right when I walked in, and didn't mind taking the time to talk with me a little extra while I was deciding on what to get and while I was waiting.   Ended up just getting a pepperoni calzone. and while I will say it was a little on the greasy side.... I just couldn't put it down once I started, and I enjoyed every bite of it.  Definitely gonna go there again whenever I'm back around at the north end of campus!
1 Nick's delivery is terrible! And hour and a half.... Yea no pizza. I dont know know if "NY" stands for Not ( getting) Your pizza but seriously wtf??? Never again ! Cannot wait to get your cold soggy pizza. This was our first time trying them and never again. You guys suck!!!! I hope you go out of business for treating your customers so badly!
3 They called within 24 hours apologizing and tried to make it right. This goes a looong way for me. It was much appreciated.
