5 Never had a problem at this location. Food has always been fresh and hot. So whether or not it was just made, it at least seems like it.
2 The food there is average. Sometimes the chili has ZERO beans in it.  The biggest problem is EVERY SINGLE time I've gone through the drive through, when we get home the order is wrong.  I won't go to that location any more.
1 I have given them chance after chance, the only reason I return is because my wife and kids don't seem to mind the cold food that they serve here.     At Breakfast time I have attempted to order the sausage burritos. In return I get an item that is nearly room temperature. The cheese has not even melted by the time I get it.  I experienced this at least  on the last 3 occasions.    At lunch I ordered a simple #1 meal.  I received a cold burger. I took it back to the register, where they did apologize. But in return I got another burger at the same room  temperature. What gives? I would have been happy if they would have just nuked the first one for a few seconds. Burned yet again.  The staff don't look like they want to provide any customer service, let alone exceptional customer service. I will be avoiding this location from now on.
5 Great hot food! We had a jr bacon cheeseburger, fries, chicken nuggets, and a chocolate frosty.
2 This place use to be decently clean, but now they have gone down hill. When I walked in there was a few tables that had trash on it still. This store really needs to remodel to the new Wendy's here in the valley. Plus the costumer service could be better, it seems like the employees don't even want to be here, it would explain why they are looking for a new manager and crew members.   I'll still come here, just not inside to eat.
