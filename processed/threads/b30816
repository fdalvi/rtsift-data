1 No.  Never again.  Last year we went in for our yearly physical and billing got the codes wrong so our insurance would not pay, we ended up being billed for something that should have been covered.  After going round and round with MFP billing "manager" my employer finally paid the bill.    This year we decided to give them another chance and once again we are dealing with billing assigning the wrong code for part of our services.  Our insurance (different company) this year is trying to contact the billing "manager" and we are leaving messages (interesting we cannot actually talk to anyone and she rarely calls back).    What ends up happening is a passing of the buck and most likely we will end up paying for something that should be covered, a routine physical for insurance purposes.   I finally learned my lesson and am going to find another PCP.
1 Wow, just terrible service and long waiting time. I do not recommend going here for your PCP needs.
