4 This library is small, but perfectly formed.  The staff are friendly and welcoming to an unfamiliar face such as mine and they are perfectly happy for you to have a look around, use the computers or just sit and read for a while.    The sections of the library are well defined into Romance, Children's Books and Travel etc.  But what impresses me most about this library is the community spirit that eminates throughout the place.  When I was in last, it was littered with school children, some elderly members of the community and mums chatting in a corner with kids in buggies.    With all the necessary technologies a modern library might need, in a quaint long standing building, the Corstorphine library is central to this community I think, even more so than the locals might realise.
4 I came across this particular library by total accident - and even though it is out of my way, I still use it on occassion when I cant find what I am looking for anywhere else. Thats the brilliant thing about this place - it has an amazing knack of having that book you really wanted to read available, when many other bigger libraries just dont have it.  My only complaint of this place is how small it is, but really this adds to the charm - along with the lovely staff who are so helpful it is sometimes a bit scary that any human being can be that pleasent.
