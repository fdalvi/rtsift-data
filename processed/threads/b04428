3 Hidden little nook, right next to JcPenny (on the south west side).   If you are anything like me & don't own a needle & thread (it's sad, I know!) then this is a good place to go if you need to have something hemmed or tailored. They also do embroidery, although that can get a bit price if you are wanting an intricate or large design. My daughter had her best friends initials embroidered onto a small bag & it was $15, reasonable I think, & it came out really nice! It does add a little something extra & makes gifts more personal & thoughtful :)    An important note, so you won't be caught off guard, this store works on CASH only & requires pre-payment.   During the holiday season the turn around time was 1 week, but maybe now that it's over the wait time is less.
3 A bit hard to find, but these folks are professionals!  If you don't know what your doing, or what you need, they will help.    My deduction of two stars is due to the fact the workers were irritable and annoyed.  The fact they take limited forms of payment takes a star back too.
5 I recently had my husband's business name embroidered on some shirts.  I couldn't be happier with the results.  The Manager/owner? Marla was so amazingly helpful, she really went the extra mile to get this done for me.  From helping me pick the font, the color, size, placement, etc. she advised and was so easy to work with.   I highly recommend Altered States. (the only thing to remember is that they only take cash or checks, no plastic)
