5 I've lived in the Las Vegas area for over 10 years and I've been to different salons and never found the right person to cut my hair/style.I went to Bong Bella's salon for the first time and he knew exactly what to do with my hair! I can not begin to tell you how happy and satisfied I am! I'm so happy that I've found him! I will definitely recommend Bong Bella Salon to my friends and family!
5 Bong is INCREDIBLY talented!   Bong has been mine & my mom's hair stylist for over 3-4 years now. My haircuts are always amazing; but he really specializes in color. What I really love is that he bases hairstyles & colors on YOUR face shape & skin tone. All I have to do is give him an idea of what color or haircut I want & he'll deliver it while incorporating his own little twist.   I definitely recommend Bong Bella to anybody who wants to have AMAZING hair!
5 He's a amazing hair stylist...He's such a perfectionist and does a amazing job cutting and coloring your hair ...
