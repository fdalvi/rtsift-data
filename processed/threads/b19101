5 This is a great little market and the owner is super friendly. I love the labne and the braided string cheese. The pitas are great, and the hummus is excellent. And thanks to this market, I was able to introduce my family to sumac! If I'd had more time, I would have perused the shelves a little more for more Mediterranean treats!
3 Nice place and great customer service just pricey
