4 Great little neighborhood coffee shop.  I was in town for the Ironman and needed my morning jolt to get the day going.  Barista was friendly, and the coffee was strong enough to shake off the 14 hour drive I just finished.    If you are in the neighborhood, this beats a chain any day of the week.
5 I don't drink cappacinos, lattes or other coffee drinks,  I just drink black coffee.  The EVP's in town are simply the best cup of black coffee in Madison, and that means any brew.  While another coffee shop has my favorite maple nut scone in Madison, EVP definitely has very good pastry.
5 One of my favourite coffee shops.  Location is good (for me), but it has the downside that it closes early.  Good coffee, generally a nice quiet place to work.
