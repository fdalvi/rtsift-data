5 Wow what a great surprise! I was shopping and saw this location, my dad's bday is tomorrow and of course I procrastinated. Last time I ordered edible arrangements it was prob the best gift idea ever. So why not again!   Esther was awesome! So friendly and happy and not to mention- no judgement of me even though my makeup and clothes clearly said "I wore this last night and I had a Blast!!" Anyway- she helped me find the best arrangement for my pops, a location near his house, and even waited patiently while I called the other two crazy Cifonelli's for their approval!! And then I had to call pops to see if he might be home, haha this girl is now initiated into the Cifonelli Clan lol, hard to do.   Anyway I don't believe that other whiney review about the 82 year old grand mom and blah blah - she's 82, she ain't loosing sleep over fruit, relax sista!  We will have to see when my delivery happens in California, there's a 98 year old there to answer the door! Haha! I'm optimistic because ESTHER WAS SO NICE!!! Yay for chocolate covered pineapple!
1 Be careful what you purchase.  For $50 you get the smallest arrangement they can make.  Salesperson made it sound like it would serve 4 but actually only 1-2.  If they would bother to have displays with fake fruit, you could make a better choice or just leave.
