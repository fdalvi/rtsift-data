4 This place is a bit far from my house, but unlike the stores closer by they seem to have any and every part you can imagine for remote control cars.  I needed a part and the 2 other places I called had never even carried it, but I called up Hobbytown and they found it for me and held it till I got there.  So in the long run it saved me more time.  The next time I broke the front wheel and suspension and headed over without calling and they helped me find and they had all the parts I needed to get back up and running.  The staff are definitely helpful and as far as I can tell know what they are doing.  I'll definitely be back.
3 Pretty decent hobby shop, though on my most recent visit the inventory was down and the store was more messy than usual.  Lots of paint colors out of stock (particularly some that I needed).  I'm not sure what the deal is, seems like they aren't taking care of the place.  There's always been some pretty good knowledge here and the people are helpful.  Prices are pretty typical.
1 Rude staff and disorganized store! And they wonder why business is down.
1 Very unhelpful. The guy i talked to was pleased to tell me " no we won't do repairs" and "no I can't suggest someone who does" Weak on half assed don't bother. Hard for me to go back,  if ever. There are better. Sad cause there are close to me Almost duck dynasty like lacking the dynasty. Find someone else
2 Went here for the second and last time yesterday. Today the employee I spoke with just didn't seem to care about anything. Their selection is hit or miss. The place is a bit run down and prices are certainly full retail. There are better shops around so I give up on this one.
1 Very horrible customer service. I'm always excited to do business with smaller shops but this was a mistake. Very rude and completely unwilling to be helpful in the smallest way. Horrible. Don't go there. Travel further for better service.
