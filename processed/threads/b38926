5 The Whisky Stramash event only comes once a year, around the 25th and 26th of May, but what an event!  Set within the grand dramatic building of Surgeons Hall, steeped in great whisky history and tradition. This is a ticketed event (£26.00 plus £2.60 booking fee) Upon entry we got a whisky glass for the sampling and to keep.   There was an amazing wide range of different whiskies to sample in various grand rooms.    Such as:  Glen Moray, Glenfiddich, The Balvenie, A big canoe, Black Bottle, Bunnahabhain, Tobermory, Ledaig, The Macallan, Highland Park, Laphroaig, The Glenrothes, Wemyss Malts, BenRiach, Glendronach, Tomatin, Scotch Malt Whisky Society, AnCnoc, Jura,  Fettercairns, Benromach, Paul John Malt Whisky, Douglas Laing, Big Peat, Harviestoun Craft Brewery with some Highland Park aged Beer!, Woodford Reserve Bourbon, Gordon and MacPhail Select Range, Tullibarine, Kilchoman, , English Whiskey & New Zealand Whiskey Collection ......to name a few!  Along with the whisky tasting they have some entertainment.  The Deanston Malt Whisky took vintage photo of visitors and dressed them as distillery workers from days of old, which was really fun!  We got a print to take home too.  There was a Crazy Molecular Sensory Lab who created "Heston" type experiments, who thought bacon and HP sauce would go well with whisky?  Glenfiddich took visitors on a tour of a interactive virtual warehouse and sample a couple along the way. There was also a pop-up Speakeasy bar, creating whisky cocktails.  A great day, can't wait for next years!
4 Slightly different layout this year from last, feels a lot more crowded and not as many whiskies??
