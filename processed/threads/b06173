1 Not helpful at all, avoid this place!  Can care less about customers.
2 Like the other review says, the prices are outrageous.  This place is very expensive.  I was disappointed to see the indoor pool they had on display has been removed.  That pool made the store unique.  Now it is nothing special.
3 I know they're mostly for pool stuff but I don't have a pool. I don't know if most people know or not, but they have Christmas stuff during the holidays that is rather nice.   I like their trees because they have ones that aren't the generic crinkly string type trees but they carry realistic trees of various breeds. If you have big trees or need lawn or huge blow up decor they have those too.   They were pretty nice and helpful even though I was just looking at clearance Christmas stuff this visit. They opened up the trees that werent on display so we can see the bristles and color and answered out questions on lighting. We ended up getting a 7ft coastal fir tree for $100, LED bush net lights, and a dozen regular string lights. I went overboard with the lights on the tree but it definitely doesn't make my tree look generic.   It's a bit hard for me to really give a review rating since I go for seasonal items and not their year round business, but this is definitely a good Christmas stop.  (Yelp 100 Challenge 2/100)
