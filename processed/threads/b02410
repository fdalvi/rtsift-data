2 I believe that Streets of New York is a chain, and I've certainly enjoyed my experience at other locations, but this one in particular was a bit of a disaster. The food was all right, but the service was slow and unfriendly. The waiters were borderline anti-social and another guy who seemed to be the owner or at least the manager wasn't much better.   If you're yearning for Streets of New York Pizza, try another location.
1 Shocker this place closed!  This location was open for a long time and was great for a lot of it. I don't know if owners changed or what but it went downhill fast. The service got awful and the quality of the food got bad too. I would be sad that this location closed but I had already quit going to this location months before they shut the doors.
1 I called this location to order a pizza for delivery. I was staying at the La Quinta down the street. I received a message stating this location had been closed. They did provide two other locations and numbers for their other locations that could assist me. I did call one of their other stores, I am writing a review for that store separately.   I am only giving it 1 star due to it being closed (why rate my past experiences at this location now).
