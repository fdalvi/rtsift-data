5 We moved into our home and had an electrical problem. Robert, unlike other big firms, provided a rough estimate over the phone and was there in less the 12 hours. They quickly completed the repairs at a fraction of the cost of what the other firms were asking. Outstanding electrician!
1 David came out quickly then emailed us a quote within a few day to rewire our house.  The quote seemed fair and David was very nice and knowledgeable. We decided to have him go ahead with the plans. He told us it would be a couple of weeks until he started so he could finish another job.  After a couple of weeks we contacted him and he said that it would probably be another month due to the holiday season. We were patient and after the holidays we called him and left a message to see when he would be able to start. He has still not returned our calls. So now we've wasted 3 months.
5 David came over to check out a ceiling fan that wasn't working in my house. He arrived within the 2 hour window he scheduled with me the day before. He's a really friendly, courteous guy with a lot of experience in all kinds of electrical work. Within about 20 minutes he was able to pinpoint exactly what was wrong with my fan, and had it repaired and working perfectly about 15 minutes later.   I can't say enough how happy I am with 24hr Valleywide Electric. David was very straightforward and upfront about the work he was doing, and worked in a way that assured me that he was not trying to charge me as much as possible--instead, it was clear that he was focused on doing a good job and charging a fair price. What more can you ask for?  I'll definitely be calling 24hr Valleywide Electric again. Thanks for a job well done!
