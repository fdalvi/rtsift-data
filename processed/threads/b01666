2 The food was just okay. Super greasy from the lard in the beans and meat was not of good quality. The tortillas they used were very good though. But because if the grease pouring out of my burrito I couldn't eat it.
3 Nothing really blows your socks off here for it being mexican food. It is good, and it hits the spot. Definitely a better alternative than the los betos and filibertos because its the same price but way better food.  Not top quality. I like the place though.  The respados here suck though, so steer clear.  Tortas are good and their version of a papusa (i forget what they call it here, gordos or something that is taco bell reminiscent) are my top recommendations
