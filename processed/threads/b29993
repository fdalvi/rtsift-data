5 I started coming here ever since moving to Arizona.  My experience here has been nothing but amazing and I can really say Dr. Lepetich is the best dentist I have had.  My kids love coming here too and he is so gentle and patient (which is much needed with my kids:).  I always felt lost and like a number at my previous dentist, but never here.  Glad I found this place and would definitely recommend!!
5 The doctor is amazing. He was kind and gracious to me. I was thrilled to find such a caring dentist.
5 Front desk staff was friendly and caring!  Hygienist had great clinical skills and knowledgable about oral hygiene and current dental products. Dentist was gentle and patient.  Great Gilbert dental office!
5 Dr. Lepetich is one of the best dentists that has ever treated me. He, along with a very professional office staff, provides excellent care of both your mouth and your comfortable well being. Having suffered with dental anxiety for many years, finding a good dentist has always been a struggle for me.  My recent relocation to Mesa from the Midwest placed me into yet another situation about who will care for my dental health.  Thanks to a best friends coaching I chose Copper Canyon and have had zero regrets.  I highly recommend Dr. Lepetich and his office to anyone needing dental services.   Stating simply, you won't find a more caring dentist who puts all of his patients at the top of his list.
