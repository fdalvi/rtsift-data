2 Could the optician be anymore lethargic or uncaring?  Geez!  I had a major problem with my first pair of glasses/prescription, so I had to buy new frames.  He helped me but did so under duress.  And he didn't even check the fit when they were finished.  Do any of the people at Lenscrafters really know what they are doing?
1 Terrible service. Paid for express shipping only to get the wrong pair after 3 weeks of waiting. Still have not yet got my glasses.
5 I went there for a repair of my glasses that broke while I was staying there for a conference.  The people were very helpful and made the repair at no charge.
