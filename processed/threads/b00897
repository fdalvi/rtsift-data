4 This place is Awesome!!!! I went in looking for a hinge, and came out with the hinge. a small pink LED flashlight for my daughter, and the Bronski Beat in my head. Where else will you hear Small Town Boy in a hardware store!!! They staff was fantastic, and so were my fellow shoppers.  I am never going anywhere else.
5 Ace is the place!!! Really it is, this location is very well managed, it is always clean and the staff is very helpful, this is probably one of the few stores I have been to in Phoenix believe it or not that has that home town "Cheers" type of atmosphere...I mean it's a hardware store come on!!!! But seriously being a guy, I could die in this store I mean it's a hardware store, I can build STUFF and give things MORE POWER...arh arh arh in my best TIM "the toolman" Allen impersination!!! Which is cool!!!!   Anyway, I have been to this location several times, and I am always happy with the staff, the service, and they always have everything I need, I mean everything, I have never had to go to any place else when I needed a household item.   Anyway I can't really tell you to much more about a hardware store, but this one is probably the best one I have been to in the valley. If you need something for your home or apartment this is the place to go.
5 I'm just glad to be supporting the little guy instead of the Big Orange F'ers or the Big Blue Bastards. Ace is a complete hardware store. I can always get what I need. I get in and out quick, the workers are accessible and friendly and helpful - did you hear that Home Despot?? HELPFUL!! and I can get an ice cream at 7:30 in the morning. I go to ACE for all kinds of things -children's safety stuff, lawn care, tools, hardware, ad infinitum.  never have to wait long in line. The music is usually pretty good stuff. Parking is not so good -the parking lot is circa 1975, but it's local and convenient in so many ways. support your local ACE.
5 folks, their slogan, doesn't lie i met, the helpful, hardware guy at Ace. this morning, name was joe and, as far, as hardware goes joe's an ace, 'bout bolts and nuts sprinkler heads, lopers to cut overgrown, oleanders customer service, old school standards trellis, to train, my bouganvilla joe, the ace, trumps bob vila u know, the tv handy man that bearded, beard, for a brand knows each item, in that store on his ACT's, scored 34 well that's not true, i didn't ask but the ACE test, he surely passed like all the others, on their floor makes me wish, that there were more stores run like this, may cost a few shekles more, but wouldn't you rather deal with helpful joe than what they have, at Home Depot?
5 I needed to get an extra key made but I was in a rush and didn't want to go walk through a big store like Walmart to get one made. Some lady at the gas station told me I should go to Ace Hardware. They had tons of different designs to choose from and i settled on a key with rhinestones on it. I was tempted to get another one made for my roommate but I was in a rush. I was in and out in 5 minutes!
5 Every time I go into this particular store, I wonder why do I ever go any place else. There are other stores closer to my house but it is worth it to make the drive. The attitude of the staff is terrific.  Rarely do I find they don't have what I want in stock.  It reminds me of the hardware stores I used to go to as a kid.  They always had a little of everything and someone to help you find it.  If not, usually some one could make a suggestion as to what else might be used or where to find it. The "good old days" never went away with this store. How many stores can you walk into and say you need red  laquer color paint-the ornate chinese type and they will walk you to it!  From the front to the back, this store is the best!
5 This particular Ace is the bomb.  Anytime I go in here the staff answers my questions and gets me out the door with exactly what I need.  On my last visit I had to buy a cart to haul a bass amp (heavy stuff) and the guy who helped me is also a musician so we had fun talking about music, roadies and live shows.  I just love that everyone here treats you like they know you, a great neighborhood vibe that Phoenix is often lacking.  Bonus = he carried out my purchases and loaded the trunk for me.  Ace is the place!
5 This Ace is probably the best hardware store in Phoenix.  It is always clean and well-stocked, and the people who work here are very friendly and helpful. I find that I can get 99% of what I need here, so I don't have to go to the big box out-of-town places.  Whether I need shelf brackets, cords and cables, keys, or tools, I can count on the folks at my neighborhood hardware store to get me what I need.  Did I mention that they carry old-school sodas like Bubble-Up and they have Mexican Coke? Score!
5 This store rocks!  They invited me to park my bike inside, and then helped me find some parts I need to modify it.  It took a lot of going and coming to to get it right, but they did it patiently and went far beyond anything I would have asked. It was truly amazing service for what would ultimately be a  $20 sale.  I wanted to tip the associate, but found out after it was all over that he was the owner.
5 This is the other Ace Hardware store I shop at. As I stated in another Ace store review, I was in the middle of rearranging/decorating our guest bedroom for J's nephew's visit tomorrow (Thursday). I needed to get things in order, or else he's be sleeping on either the floor or the couch.   This past Sunday, I started the task of getting the room in order. We have the digital phone modem and a 27in TV (The TV, which had gone unused and unplugged for over a year) in that room. I proceed to move the dresser to another wall and quickly realized that I'd need a Coaxial Cable Splitter.   I called up Howard's Ace to see if they had the parts I needed. No point in making the trip if only to find out they're sold out! They inform me they have what I need, so I head out.   I get there and remember I also need a few other things (electrical tape, a curtain rod, and grounded plug adapter). I arrive and the greeter asks if I need help. I tell him what I need and he escorts me around the store. I'm in and out within 10 minutes with all my items.   I usually shop at this Ace on the weekends, if I an not near the other Ace in Scottsdale. From my Toro weed eater, a drain catch, to my prior Ace purchase - a professional drain snake (Thanks to my hair, I clog the bathtub drain quite a bit. And I'm not about to pay a plumber for a job I can do myself. And I'm not about to shave my head anytime soon), this Ace IS the place!! :)
4 If you need an obscure part for plumbing or electrical work this is the place to go in East Phoenix. The employees are very helpful and friendly and the selection is great.
5 this is a great hardware store!  Very clean, well stocked and organized.  The employees are very helpful and always available.  Prices are reasonable.  There is nothing I hate more than going to a store for something specific and finding that they have everything but the item I need (**cough** Home Depot ** cough **).  This Ace never does that to me!  It is also right next to a Checker (O'Rielly) Auto Parts, so if you need something for your car you can get that too.  As a matter of fact, there is also a Food City there!  So if you need new windsheild wipers, some peppers, and socket set, you will be all set by going to this Ace Hardware!  Bertha's Cafe is across the street, so go there too!
5 These guys are knowledgeable and don't wast time in helping you. I was always running to Home Depot, but this ACE is close to my crib and I realized that a few more pennies gets me in and out right away and quality hardware. I also like that the local hardware store is alive and well.   I walked in with a diagram drawn by my friend (That looked like it was drawn by a 5 year old) of what I needed and the guy walked me into the plumbing aisle and set me up in 5 minutes.   I would have been standing in Home Depot for another 20 min to get someone to tell me that they needed to get me someone in plumbing! LOL! I will not go anywhere else!
5 I live sandwiched between Ace and Home Depot.  This review is a long time in the making, but well worth the wait.  A while back I was a Home Depot shopper, on my last visit into "do it your self hell"  I was treated so badly by their rude staff I have never been back!    Going into Ace has been a polar opposite. The staff here are awesome!  They answer my questions no matter how crazy they might be and are very helpful in the process.   I really can't say enough good things about this place called ACE.
5 On the East side of Phoenix, there are 2 options for Home Improvement - Home Depot ( Thomas Rd & 36th St)  or this location for Ace Hardware.  Honestly, I go to HD often for their pricing, large selection, rental equipment, landscaping needs, and much more.    I recently replaced an old 1950's toilet with a Toto Dual Flush and installed a new gas range in my home.  After consulting with Travis from Strong Home Improvement, he said that Ace is the Place.  They will answer your questions, point you towards the right fixtures and are ALWAYS Helpful.  He was right-on-the-money.  Each and every visit (4x), the staff knew what I was asking for and knew EXACTLY where the parts where located in the store.    If you are tackling a project at home, ACE is your PLACE!
4 I must  in go here 2 or 3 times a week  in search of something I can't find in places like Home Depot. Staff is very Helpful and friendly.
5 This is a neighborhood location for me as well.  I often go in two or three times a weekend while working on home projects.  For me, this place is like an extension of my toolchest.  If I don't have it, I know I can get it here.  I can also get good helpful advice when I need it.  There is one employee here that for me stands out.  Her name is Miranda and she is one of the checkout clerks.  She always has a friendly greeting, a smile that can light up the day and is always courteous and helpful. I always try to get in her line, just because she is so nice.  It's people like Miranda that keep customers coming in the door.  I know, I'd come in anyway, but it helps to know I am appreciated, and this store makes you feel appreciated.
5 Awesome customer service always has what i need to top it off it's centrally located i would definitely return to this location
5 This ACE Hardware has the most helpful staff of any hardware store around. I go here a lot, and almost every time there's someone at the front door to ask you what you need. What's more, if you tell them, they'll take you right to it, and stay with you as long as you want to answer questions. Their hardware selection is amazing, and the staff will talk you through almost any home improvement quandary you're experiencing. Home Depot sells their expert staff in their commercials, but it's 50/50 whether you'll find someone who knows what they're talking about. Howard's ACE is always on the ball. I never go to HD anymore unless I need raw materials in larger quantities.
5 I'm thrilled people love this place as much as I do. I can't stand Home Depot or Lowe's (which is too far away anyway). Ace is right down the road and has terrific service. Every so often, I'll hit up a big box store for things like wider fixture selections, but I usually leave unimpressed. It may not quite be mom-and-pop, but Howard's Ace is close. I'm not handy in the least, but this is a place I weirdly enjoy going.
5 You know that person (I won't say girl, just to avoid sounding sexist)  who walks into a hardware store with that look on their face that just about screams: "I don't know what the hell I'm doing"?  Yeah, that was me. The staff here were extremely helpful, they knew exactly what I needed and where to find it. The gentleman helping me even opened the box and made sure it was the exact size item I needed.  The whole trip took about five minutes. Easy.   Would definitely come back.
4 I have to agree with the other reviewers.  This place is definitely a go-to for any housewares as opposed to visiting a home depot or Lowe's.  I love that it's smaller and thus, everything is easier to find.  The staff is always there to ask if you need help and to guide you to your destination.  The prices seem to be about the same as you would pay at any of the larger home improvement stores, so to get customer service and pay about the same your best bet is to check this place out.
5 Five star customer service all the way. The staff and management make you feel like you are at the Ritz Carlton of hardware stores. I am very happy with the treatment and it for small to medium sized orders, this is the place to go! Evening manager "Chris" makes sure that every goes as simple as can be.
4 I got my roof rat bait.  Here is the place.  Seems to work.  Pacley has his nitch.
1 Wow.  What a really terrible experience.  We went in here to get shadescreen material for our windows...I called ahead, asked if they had the correct kind and was told by a very nice guy that they did indeed have what I was looking for.  I have been recovering from surgery and I was not able to walk or drive, so I got my dad to help me out by driving me over and going inside to do my "legwork".  Instead of coming out with a bundle of shadescreen material, my dad came back out of the store looking annoyed.  He said they didn't have the material and the guy in the back wanted to know the name of the guy that I spoke with.  Oops.  Sorry I didn't get his name, but if you say you have the material, why has it suddenly disappeared?  So, since we were sitting in our car in the handicapped spot just in front of the store, I decided to call and ask to speak to the manager.  He answered the phone up at the front cash register, so I could see him from our car.  I asked him what was going on and why this material was not there when I'd spoken to the guy earlier, blah blah blah.  He didn't apologize.  He didn't go check.  Didn't offer to correct the mistake by finding a store that might have it.  Nope...he said *I* must have made a mistake.  When I told him I was currently handicapped and it took a lot of effort to get to his store and that I'd called ahead precisely for that reason, he said he couldn't do anything about that and hung up the phone.  Then to make matters even worse, he POINTED at our car and started LAUGHING with the cashier at the front.  Holy crap...really?  Laugh at the handicapped girl???  Wow...I don't even know what to say about this a$$ except that I will NEVER NEVER NEVER go back here.  The Ace on 24th st is just down the street and has nicer employees even tho' it is small.  And, Paul's Ace Hardware in Tempe is by far the BEST Ace in the valley...especially if you need screening.
5 better prices on ammo than online sites?  YEP  friendly and helpful staff  YEP  that alone = 5 stars   oh, they have tons of hardware, home supply, and more tools than I would ever need  awesome!
4 great place to get the hardware you couldn't find at the bigger chains (home depot, lowes ie.). Every single employee i have spoke to has been very knowledgeable.
5 This is a great Ace Hardware. The people inside are always helpful and friendly. They always have what I'm looking for.
2 Well stocked, organized, marked, clean store. Unfortunately most of the staff knows little about the products and often gives the wrong answers. A couple of the older gentlemen know a bit more, but they are hard to find. And the other more senior folks routinely walk by, too busy to ask if you need help. Nice facility, but quality and knowledge of the staff needs work. I usually prefer shopping at an Ace or True Value, but the frustration of not being helped and then getting someone who has no idea about the products is enough to send me a couple miles further on down the road.
5 I want to take a moment to acknowledge some outstanding service that I received at my local Ace Hardware. On 1/3/2014, I went far out of my way to visit Howard's Ace Hardware at 3111 E Indian School Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85016. I live 40 miles north and west of this Ace location, but I will never forget the excellent service I received when I used to live in this area and I continue to come back when I have a hardware need.  I went to Ace to engineer a solution to a poor product design I encountered when I purchased a universal fit shifter knob for my 6-speed. I was greeted by Saul, a smart young man who went to work on my problem with enthusiasm. He tried several possible solutions before hitting on the perfect combination of spacer and nut. He accompanied me to my car several times to make certain that he had the exact correct size nut and to ensure that the solution he engineered worked as I needed. He even custom ground the nut so that it would fit inside my ill-designed shifter knob. I was so very impressed!   Congratulations on having such good people skills that you recognized and hired a smart, enthusiastic young man like Saul! Please praise his efforts because he makes you look terrific, maintains the high standards of customer service I expect and exceeded those expectations by going above and beyond my expectations.  Thank you, thank you, than you!
2 Went there a few weeks ago to get some emergency plumbing parts. A guy who was "there to help" didn't have a clue then some loud kid who couldn't be bothered to take his ear buds out of his head was a total jerk. I have been coming here for years but  I wouldn't come here if you need any kind of advice or come here during the day when the adults are working.   On the other hand they sell ammo and they normally have a ton of it.
4 Love our local Ace store! We come here for everything home and garden related. I love the American flags out front and the staff is always helpful. Plus, it feels better to support the little guy as opposed to going to Home Depot.
5 I love this place,  I don't know why I didn't say so sooner.  They have fixed and found solutions for a myriad of problems over the years.  They even fixed a chair for me.  I had problems with that chair for years and had paid chair repair guys to no avail.  I just now called for some advice on my swamp cooler because I totally trust them and again they were great!
3 The store had expectable service and a decent stock of tools.I had a small project in my studio that was taking place just last month and they had the right stuff.This particular shop is good stuff.
