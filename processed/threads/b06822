1 I'm pretty appalled on all fronts for this location.  Not only was the store unkempt, two separate employees (one a manager) were unable to help me find a product after 20 minutes of searching. While I wasn't in a rush, I was frustrated when I ended up finding it myself after their hunt.  Avoid this one and hit up any of the ones downtown if at all possible.
3 This Walgreens location is convenient to my work. I was able to find what I needed and get in and out quickly. I'm not happy about the fact that "instant coupons" advertised on shelf tags do not ring up automatically. I had to ask for the advertised price at the checkout counter, and then the cashier had to laboriously look up and scan each coupon. Pretty annoying and a good way to trick customers into paying more.
