5 Always a sure thing, big fan of Walgreens and this store is solid everytime I go.
5 I've been going to this drug store for 6 years and I just adore this store. The people are friendly and the service is wonderful
1 The customer service at this particular Walgreens is horrendous - from both the checkout counter to the pharmacy.  Never have I experienced such a lackluster attitude towards customers.  I'm generally a fan of Walgreens but I will drive the extra mile to avoid this particular Walgreens.
