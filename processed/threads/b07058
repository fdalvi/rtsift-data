2 this place is decent at best. i think it's probably good at what it does, but it's nothing i would write home about.  and i DEFINITELY write home about good food.  they have a culver's style menu specializing in fried chicken, burgers, and similar fare.  we stopped here one day after disc golfing at elver due to convenience factor. .. and because they had both ice cream and burgers -- 2 things that people in our group were craving.  service was good.  food arrival was kind of slow for us being the only ones in the restaurant.. but maybe that was 'cuz i was super hungry.    i got the mozzarella sticks which were edible, but again, nothing to rave about.  i also got the ice cream with chocolate swirls and tiny reese's-like peanut butter chocolate chunks in it.  it was alright but i feel like it needed more peanut butter and the chunks should've been more melt-in-your-mouth.  probably a good late-night eatery.  or a i-need-a-burger-and-i-need-it-now place.  but nothing awesome.
2 I stopped in on a rainy afternoon. My arthritis was flaring up really bad because of the humidity. We were all hungry so we turned onto Main st and end spotted Griff's and gave it a try.       I was disappointed they wouldn't let me use my own teapot that I came in with, but there tea was pretty decent. My waitress was at least 350 lbs but she had a warm smile.  I was pretty hungry but I only had enough for a muffin. We sat inside for around 5 hours until the rain let up - I drank a lot of tea lol
