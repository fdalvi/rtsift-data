5 I love the food. It's amazing and prepared fresh.
5 I had never tried Moroccan food before.  It was absolutely amazing!  I had the cous cous plate with chicken.  It was wonderfully spiced, much more than typical mediteranean food found around Madison.  My friends tried the falafel and said it was also amazing.  It was fresh and moist, unlike alot of falafel you find.  I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant and will be returning soon.  I just hope they make it in their location.  Easy to get to though...

2 - Friendly but very slow service - cook's fault, not the waitress' - Small portions and overcooked, dry meat - More bland than I expected. Not terrible though
3 This is a place with a talented cook.  All the food we had was excellent and well prepared.  The bastilla (slightly sweet chicken pie in filo dough) was delicious and the kofta (meat ball) tagine I had was delicious.  The portions were very generous and I brought home half my entree.  Only problem was lack of a liquor license (it is in the works apparently) and also the annoyigly loud Moroccan CD playing the background that repeated  the same song over and over.  I will certainly go back once they can serve wine and beer.  Although it is not in the best location in the world,  the food was lovely.
5 6 of us had dinner here this past Sunday evening.  The Moroccan coffee and mint tea were a huge hit.  About half of the group were vegetarian and we had no problem finding something to love.  The meat eaters loved the lamb.  The sauce sampler platter was obviously freshly made.  There were several of us that were wary of the Baba Ghanoush (it is so easy to screw up eggplant!) and we loved it.  My friend needed a decaf tea and although it wasn't on the menu, they did have it available.  Generous portions, almost all of us had leftovers.
1 As of March, 2011 this place is out of business.  Sad I didn't go more when I had the chance.  Food was great.
