5 Pros: I grew up on these hot, yeasty delicious pretzels. Every time I pass a wetzels I have to eat one.   Cons: calories, buttery, carbs, long lines
4 Fun! I like all the pretzel options & lemonade choices. Good little stop before the movies so you can fill the void & not drain your wallet at the concession stand.
2 Went to this Wetzel's Pretzels located at San Tan Village because I had a couple of coupons for a buy one, get one and a free pretzel dip. Disappointing experience. Service was grumpy and was not engaging, and I did not feel welcome into the shop. I made my order and while going to bag my order, the cashier dropped my bag onto the floor and proceeded to pick up that same bag and use it for my pretzels and dip. When I arrived back at work to enjoy the food, I was surprised to find that my "cheddar cheese sauce" was a dark goldenrod colored substance that was crusty and smelled nothing like what I would expect. Will not go to this shop again.
