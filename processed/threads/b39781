3 Dark, drinks well poured, great jukebox atmosphere.  Let's call it comfy.
5 Great place to watch a game. Friendly service, honest prices on their drinks, and a great place to make friends :)
4 One of the nicest interioirs of a bar around here. Very Clean.  Staff is friendly and actually introduced themselves after a shift change...awesome! You can order foor next door at the gyro joint...good food and folks there too.
4 Friendly service, wide open with 4 pool tables. First time here for happy hour. Bar seems pretty clean for a dive bar. Cheap drinks! No bar rescue here! I would come back!
