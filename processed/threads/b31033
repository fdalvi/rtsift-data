3 Yep, just like the name says... EVERYTHING is 10 dollars. So even that terrible hat (looks good on YOU though...) is, you guessed it, 10 dollars.  If you are in the Luxor and win 10 dollars that you just want to turn into "jewelry, accessories and watches for women, men and children" this is the place to do it.
5 Awesome convenient little store!!!  Super easy to find in the MGM.  $10 gets you anything you might have forgotten to pack: sunglasses, cell phone chargers, ear buds, hats... Plus other things like scarves, jewelry and miscellaneous.  We bought some sunglasses here after my man forgot his at home and they are holding up surprisingly well!  Vegas Trip 10/20-23/11
5 Love this store! I always stop by when I'm in Las Vegas... I only wish they had them in other parts of the country... Oh well, I guess I HAVE TO GO to Vegas again....lol Fran
