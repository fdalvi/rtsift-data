5 I am posting this late --- Last year we had noticed that our SW gas bill had skyrocketed from $30 - $162 over a 3 - 4 month period.  Not unusual for vegas in the winter but this was May and June!  Derek came out and diagnosed the problem as a leak in the hot loop.  Unfortunately, my hot loop is in the slab.  We determined that we would bypass the slab.  I had gotten 3 different quotes and would ordinarily go with the middle quote but money was so awfully tight I went with the lowest and was praying for a good job.  Derek did the work for the quoted price, in the time frame he had quoted, labor and parts, all drywall and paint done professionally,  and clean up was awesome.  I saved a BIG chunk of dough and enormously pleased.  I have no problem referring Moonlight to others.  Thank you Derek!
5 I called Moonlight Plumbing today and was very impressed. This wasn't the right company for my job however the technician was honest about their capabilities. I would use them in the future.
1 No integrity. I wish I could give them 0 stars. I would not recommend using this company at all. Screwed me over. Seriously, do yourself a favor and look for another company. They do not keep their word.
