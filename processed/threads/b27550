3 First of all, I love noodle soups.  They are one of my favorite comfort foods.  So, needless to say I was very excited to discover that a ramen place had arrived in Tempe.  My husband and I went on their opening day.  It was a soft opening, so please keep this in mind.  Decor:  Minimalist and modern, which is nice.  There is a cafeteria/warehouse feel to it.  Definitely not cozy.   Food: My husband ordered the Miso ramen with an egg added and edamame and I got the Republic ramen with an egg added and gyoza.  Both ramens were okay.  The Miso ramen soup had a ginger flavor that seemed to overpower the subtle taste of the miso and the Republic ramen soup was not as flavorful as I would have liked it (and it was NOT due to the lack of salt).  Also, I was a bit disappointed by the texture of the noodles, the temperature of the soup, and how the egg was served.  The noodles were a bit too al dente for both my husband and me; a bit on the stringy side.  The soup was served hot, but not hot enough such that it stayed hot.  My ramen went from hot to luke-warm in a matter of five minutes.  I like my soups piping hot.  The egg was served extremely hard boiled, sliced in half, and placed in the soup.  I prefer the egg to be served poached by cracking it raw into the piping hot soup.  My husband's edamame was fine, as expected.  Edamame is hard to mess up.  Finally, my gyoza was also okay, however, there were these small rubbery bits in the filling here and there and no dipping sauces to accompany them.    Service:  It's not a full service sit-down restaurant.  You order your meal at the counter when you walk in.  They give you a number and bring your meal to your table.  They will clear your dishes for you as well, but the drinks are self serve.   All-in-all, for the style of service they were going for, it was not bad.  But, it wasn't clear what we were responsible for and what we were not.  There are utensils and napkins by the drinks, so my husband and I thought we would have to grab our own, but the waitress brought us some as well when she brought our meal to us.  Also, we had to ask if we were suppose to leave our dishes or clean up after ourselves.  We weren't sure because when the waitress brought our meal, she left us the tray she used to bring out our dishes.  Conclusion: The food and experience was okay.  However, again, it was their first day.  So, my husband and I plan on giving them another try in a few months.  I will update when we do.
4 Not quite as good as Tohzan, but a solid second choice.  Phx has really been lacking a decent ramen house and this fills the void in the Tempe area.   I had the shoyu ramen which was excellent and reminded me of the more traditional style I'm used to, but my partner had the Republic ramen which was spicy, delicious and of Korean inffluence. We also had the gyoza which were OK, but I thought they would be better. Next time I would opt out of those and maybe try a different side. There were also kim-chi, fried rice and edamame as other options for sides as well as other toppings for the ramen.  I was very pleased with my first visit and can't wait to go again. I do hope they expand and branch out the menu to some other ramen styles and maybe so other sides.   Excellent ramen and good work Republic!
3 I'm from Los Angeles, and I've had some incredible ramen in that area, and was really sad that there aren't really any ramen places around the Phoenix area.  When I first learned that there was a ramen place opening up, I thought to myself that there was the potential for a great experience.  The idea of this place is nice, but the execution is lacking.  I ordered the Republic Ramen + Gyoza combo, with the extremely spicy option, no additions, I wanted to try their base specialty.  The gyoza was alright, it was a little too greasy when I got it, but I much prefer fried gyoza to steamed, so that was a plus.  Unfortunately, this gyoza was mixed, meat and veggies, and I wasn't prepared for that.  Generally, I prefer pork gyoza, although I know some people who prefer veggie gyoza.  The combination didn't work too well because there wasn't quite enough meat, and the veggies were a little too rubbery for my taste.  Individually, components were good, I could tell the vegetables were fresh; the green onion had the taste of raw green onion, the bean sprouts were crisp, the spinach hadn't the time to wilt. and the naruto slice tasted of fish, and not of bland texture.  What I found lacking, however, was that the broth was overly salty and lacking it's own depth of flavor, it was also not hot enough, and the pork was very overcooked - I'm not just saying that, either, the pork was brown.  As a matter of taste, I would have preferred they use japanese spinach or nori in the ramen, and for the broth to have been piping hot, still bubbling even.  All in all, it was nothing spectacular, with lots of room to improve.  For the price, though, it was a decent meal.
4 I really liked this place!  Walking inside to this sleek and beautifully appointed fast/casual restaurant is a stark contrast to the lack-luster strip mall complex that it calls home.  Clean white walls surround the modern chairs and deep benches with dark wood accents.  I love the splash of blue mosaic tiles up front as well.  Whoever designed the interior has a sweet sense of style.  The menu here is really no nonsense.  There's about 4 different types of ramen, an assortment of sides, and then there are multiple variations of Boba in the room adjacent.  I chose the Shoyu Ramen.  The broth was rich and savoury and provided a nice contrast to the simple noodles.  There were a couple large slices of pork in the soup, but I would have preferred more small chunks instead.  I liked that there were lots of bean sprouts in my ramen and it added a satisfying crunch.  I would definitely come here again when I want some Fancy Cup of Noodles without all the preservatives :o)  Don't get confused though, I say Cup of Noodles in loving jest, because really, it's ramen, but this is really good quality stuff.  Give it a try!
4 Well, despite having (ugh) tapioca (ugh) that they stick in tea, the Republic is a pretty awesome place.  Now my wife tells me that this is different than Pho but I don't really see how.  It's a bowl of scalding hot soup full of noodles and meat.  Anyways, this stuff is really tasty.  Way better than the cup of noodles you lived off in college.  I tried the Republic which was apparently the spicy one.  It was decently spicy but I still added some of that magic red sauce.  It came with a side of edemame which had been steamed and lightly salted. The workers were all friendly and helpful.  The interior was very nice and made me feel quite welcome.  My only complaint was the price.  I feel like $8 for a bowl of noodles is asking a lot.  Especially in Tempe.
4 If you want a tastey noodle dish, possibly with boba tea to follow, this is a great new option for North Tempe. I've only been there once so far, but intend on making this place a frequent stop. They've upgraded a bit since some of the earlier reviews and you can now order cafe items from the main restaurant's register.  The service was fast and friendly, the noodles were excellent, the portions were generous (though the meat could be a little MORE generous, given the price of the dish), and the honeydew milk tea was refreshing.  During the meal the chef came out and chatted with our table a bit. Sounds like they'll be adding more types of noodle dishes to the menu shortly. If you're a fan of Asian noodles, this place is definitely worth stopping in at.
5 Just went to Republic Ramen a few weeks ago and again Saturday, everyone had been raving over the boba and ramen.  It was delicious. Since my friend told me they had added a vegetarian ramen, so  I was excited to go back and had to try it.  Impressions; Loved the modern decor, felt very urban. The staff was also nice and helpful. Eager to share about the different flavors!  The Ramen was wonderful. There was a nice amount of vegetables and a lot of tofu. The flavor of the broth was amazing. The noodles were cooked just the way I like them. The boba was fresh and I tried 2 different flavors. I had one with espresso that came recommended by the boba barista for the caffeine kick I needed, it was full of flavors as he said! I truly enjoyed it all and I will definitely be back soon.
4 I am happy to hear that a ramen noodle place opened in valley.  I love eating ramen noodles when I was in Cali.  At first driving into the plaza, it bring back the days when I attended ASU.  This location used to be billiard place. It was definitely a college hangout, still is.  The space of the restaurant is huge.  They divided portion of the restaurant with a Boba bar.  I thought it was pretty neat.  I didn't try the Boba drink, but my friend did.  I can't remember what she had, but the drink was too watery and too sweet, according to her.  The menu selection is small.  I had ordered their house ramen, Republic Ramen.  It was supposed to be mild, but of course it came out with a kick.  You get two or three charsiu porks, so call veggies (lot of scallions) lack of spinach, and sprouts.  I think they forgot to put in the sprouts.   The soup base was spicy.  That was it!  The soup was very bland.  Was it worth the $6.95 for a bowl of ramen?  Not really!  Would I go back? Yeah probably so, the restaurant can fit a large crowd; friendly staffs, and good mid location (Tempe).
2 firstly, they get 2 stars cause of the good effort and the sincere service of the wait staff, who are obviously anime fans and like all things Japanese :) but seriously, very attentive and good service, only reasoin why i give them 2 stars  overpriced and very average broth.  For like 7 bucks u get 3 thin slices of "char-shiu" , some sprouts, some golden mushroom and decent amt of noodles.  But realy, its 2 bucks to add 3 more slices of char shiu ?  and like 1 dollar to add sprouts ?  come on, thats a rip off.    The only reason U go here is if u are too lazy to drive to somewhere better and really must have a hot bowl of ramen.  In this case I guess U can settle for this, but if U just want soup, go down to Khai Hoang on Apache and Mcclintock and U get much much better and more ingredients soupy broth noodles.  Dun go here for ramen if U can, go to like iKitchen or Sushi Ken, either one will top this place hands down.
4 I have yet to have the food here, however, their Boba Tea is great!! I have been looking for a new place to get Boba Tea and a friend took me here a few weeks ago and I have gone several times since! They make the tea several different ways (snow, slush, etc.) and have every flavor you could imagine. My favorite is the coconut milk tea (made with black tea)..yum!! Another great one is the snow taro tea made with soy milk and black tea. If you like Boba Tea, you will love this place. Also, pretty well priced. $3.25 for a small tea which is more like a medium.
4 I've gone twice - the weekend they opened and then the next weekend. I had to stop myself from going a third time because I could sense a snowball effect happening (both the fear I might start living there and the fear of becoming rounder and rounder in the mid section).   Went to Japan last year and fell in love with kyushu/hakata ramen. Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe's is closer to what I had in Tokyo (though only half as good), but this was still very good. Got the Republic ramen which came as a nice big helping, piping hot. The noodles were done perfectly - not overdone. The pork the first time was super! I could taste the ginger and the pieces were large and lean. The second time I was disappointed in the pork - it was a smaller portion, fattier, and less taste. I did fear they pulled out the big guns for opening weekend and won't be the same from then on. Guess I'll have to go a third time to get a good average.   I agree with others on here - skip the gyoza. I'm a huge fan of gyoza when done right, but these were greasy and thick with no dipping sauce if I'm remembering correctly.   Oh - and yes, the look is modern but the benches have a bit of an unfinished edge. I thought I was going to get a splinter. Look out for this or opt for the high top seating.
4 Never thought much about Ramen noodles and how you can really make a meal of it.  Generally, it's one of those college foods you eat when you're dead broke and starving.  I can appreciate taking a simple dish and making it the main feature of the restaurant.  The noodles here is good and spicy I must say - if you need more spice; grab yourself a bottle of Siracha.  I can't handle my spice like I used to and it was just right for me.  Decor was simple Ikea like furniture - nothing wrong as long as it works.  Service was good with a friendly smile.  If I ever need another Ramen fix and feel lazy to make my own - I know where to go now.  There's a little boba shop connected to Republic so don't forget to grab some with your meal.  Enjoy!
4 Mmm, ramen!  The ramen here seems like a healthier fresher version of the stuff you can get in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, CA!  I wonder if the owner is from California...  Anyways, the ramen here is quite delicious!  It has a chewy texture and the broth is full of flavor.  The variety of vegetables makes me feel like I ate something healthy versus eating something super heavy like pho can do at times.  I had the miso ramen with spam and gyoza combination and it was amazing.  The gyoza was a dumpling of flavor.  While there's still better ramen places out there, I'd still recommend this place to anyone!
4 I'm happy to see that something worthwhile has replaced the dismal hole that was Sparky's.  The atmosphere is light and calm, the service is friendly, and the staff seems to enjoy what they do.  When I went, they said they were still perfecting their recipes, which means it should only get even better.  You order at the counter, grab a table, and they bring your food when it's ready.  Soda is self-serve.  I had ramen and spam, and it was my first time with spam.  It was good for what it was, but just not to my taste.  The rest of the soup was pretty good though.  The squid salad ($6 for a decent amount of it) was very good and the squid didn't have that weird rubbery texture it gets when it isn't quite fresh.  I got a mango-almond snow boba and it was amaaziing.  Seriously, try this.  The guy who made it even tried some and was impressed.  Definitely will go back here.  Maybe even later today because it's sounding pretty good right now.
4 Recently went back to Ramen Republic since their soft opening.  They have added a few things to the menu and our ramen came out piping hot this time with properly cooked noodles.    All things considered, definitely beats making Top Ramen at home and it hits the spot for a quick bowl of noodles in a tasty broth.
2 My meal here was just OK.  There were a few people in line in front of us, but we waited almost 15 minutes to place our order.  Not sure why it took so long.  At least our food was quickly brought to our table.  There's only one vegetarian option on the menu, which is not ideal.  It was OK, but it seemed like there were an awful lot of bean sprouts in it and not as many noodles as I would have liked.  I quickly finished the noodles and was left with a bowl full of broth and sprouts.  There were just a few small slices of tofu...disappointing for sure.  We also ordered a smoothie, and we waited about 25 minutes for it, longer than it took us to finish our meal.  We ended up taking it with us.  They said it took so long because it took a long time to make the boba, but we ordered ours without boba, and I guess it didn't occur to them to make ours first since they could do it right away.  The restaurant was clean and the food was pretty good, but overall not a satisfying experience.  I'll probably try it again when they've had longer to get their act together.
4 Loved it.  Light and tasty soup and chewy noodles and Spam(!),what's not to like?  Price is not bad.  In Japan ramen runs about $10 so count your blessings.
4 Heard raves from friends checked it out 2pm ish with bf & bro Ordered 3 different ramens: Pork Tonkatsu, Beef Miso, Beef Spicy   Very helpful, friendly counter guy Nice chill soothing decor Very yummy ramen with perfect doness/chewiness Big bowl with lots of ramen but I could definitely eat a bit more meat for $7+ bucks Especially for all the growing/starving ASU kids nearby (Tempe is not Japan where cost of living is higher  and if they wanna thrive in a college area)  My fav was the tonkatsu soup base. Not open Sundays, not sure why not.. Could see this as a late nite after bar hangout/eatery If it stays open later like 11pm/midnite Yeah Im a night owl  We all liked Republic Ramen and will be back!
3 Its kinda a hipster place for ramen.  I am Chinese and I seem to eat a lot of noodles nothing surprise me or wows me about noodles.  However I loved the idea of a noodle place.  I will go back and want to try some of the others types of ramen.
4 I've been now twice to Republic Ramen + Noodles for lunch and the first time was good but the second was much better! The first visit the friendly guy at the counter went thru the menu and I asked what his favorite was and it was the Tonkotsu and so I got that and had beef and chicken. The bowls are VERY large so I was shocked (even though they do have a bowl at the register to show you it looks very different full). Since it was so large he package the rest up for me to go. I also had a very yummy Boba on that visit as well.  The second visit I had the Republic Ramen which was spicy but VERY good. I opted not to get any meat in the noodles this trip as all bowls include Spinach, Sprouts, Scallions, Red Pepper and Carrots that was all I really wanted. This was so good I didn't have any left overs to take with me.   I will for sure go back and try a few other dishes and more Boba drinks!  The decor is very simple and clean so that is another plus in my book!
4 My boyfriend & I decided to try this place... And we were not disappointed. It was delicious!! Cute place, clean, and everyone who worked there was super friendly. I had the Miso Ramen and the bf had the Shoyu Ramen, both were so good! I love Ramen Noodles, this place takes it to a whole new level :)
5 A foreword to this review- everyone PLEASE visit Republic Ramen for my own selfish purposes.  I've been waiting forever for quality boba somewhere near me and a legit ramen place.  This is it.  Support them :-)  MENU Noodles: The complaint from serious Ramen lovers here is that the menu might be a little limited.  However, it's Arizona, they're doing what they do right, and well, it's Arizona.  With the different varieties of add-ins and their spice/sauce selection, you can pretty much have any kind of delicious ramen you want.   They have 6 standard types of broth and 9 add-ins to mix it up.  They also have 3 combo options with edamame, gyoza, and curry rice.   Boba: In case you haven't heard, the restaurant is split into a tea care and a noodle house.  The tea cafe has a great selection of boba flavors, tea varieties and a good solid tapica pearl (not overly sweet).  Props to the Taro- it's my favorite I've had so far which includes Chinatowns in New York, San Francisco and Seattle. They also have Snows (basically an awesome slushy) and regular teas.    DRINKS: See above for the boba.  The owner said they're trying to get a liquor license and he envisions an alcoholic boba menu in the future. Whaaaat?  Best idea ever.  But, as of now, no booze.    VALUE: (hey, look! new cateogry to my reviews!) The ramen is priced exactly how it should be, so long as you save the double helping for the next meal.  Don't throw it!  It's completely comparable to Ramen in bigger cities.    CLEANLINESS/OVERALL QUALITY Brand new, spotless.  Great modern design and classy casual feel.    SERVICE They were a bit slow for what I ordered in the tea shop but the ramen comes out really quickly.  You can also order ahead for easy takeout.  I've only eaten in-house once so my service knowledge is limited.  Their takeout is 100% dependable, however.    ATMOSPHERE Urban casual without compromising atmosphere.  I would even take a date here- quick and funky, full of character, nice people, and definitely empty since this place is new and has trouble keeping a crowd (Again, please support- they're great!)
4 Good ramen is hard to come by in Phoenix. I heard about this place from one of my coworkers and thought I'd give it a try. I ordered the Republic Ramen, which was pretty decent. Spicy and plenty of stuff in it. The workers were super friendly and I'm excited to try something new next time. I recommend if you like ramen.
4 Republic is great. The service is fantastic and they truly bust their ass to bring the customer the highest quality ramen in this part of town. The prices are fantastic as you can get a huge bowl of delicious ramen for a mere $7 max. When I went I got the tonkotsu (awesome pork broth) with pork and naruto (I would also recommend, of course, an egg but they took all their eggs out of circulation because of a state?wide or countywide recall).  Really cool honesty and professional call on that as even though, as our waiter explained, that their eggs were organic and locally raised and completely unaffected it was better to be safe than sorry and save face if somebody were to ask questions concerning the eggs, BUT I digress.   The ramen was made FAST and served beautifully. The fixings, condiments, and utensils were all abundant, varied, and self-serve and I found that so convenient and well thought-out. Drinks are cheap and self-served and their boba was great.   I highly recommend the mango-almond snow and the taro-blueberry snow. My only con to the boba would have to be that it's a bit of a wait (between 10 and 20 minutes) but that's only because they have to boil the tapioca to order but at least you know you're getting a good product made fresh. Either way, it's a ramen joint and there aren't too many places around the Tempe ASU campus that sells boba, nonetheless fantastic tasting boba like this place. Best way to do it is to order your boba for dessert about halfway through your ramen so you can have sweet slushy finish to your salty, warm broth dinner. Drink water during your ramen as to not muddle and disrespect the ramen's flavor.  Service was great and really you can't ask for more than a friendly-face and enthusiastic service in a cheap high pace college ramen joint that is beautifully decorated and cranking out delicious soups minute after minute for the hordes of broke college kids and hungry twenty-somethings looking for something else than In-N-Out.   Grab your girl or dude, order some ramen, get some boba, sit back, and enjoy.
4 Came in for an early dinner with my siblings and my boyfriend. It was a nice little restaurant, you order your food and they bring it to your table. The ramen was okay, I'll have to say I've had better with more options.   But then I remember this is Arizona and we have pretty much nothing when it comes to food like this.  The guy who took my order was really friendly and very enthusiastic when it came to answering our questions. The only thing missing was screaming "Irrashaimase!" when people walked in. Lol. I had ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen and like others have said, the broth was pretty weaksauce when I compared it to Cherryblossom. It felt lacking, but it still had flavor. For some people it might be a little salty but I can see why there are lots of veggies in the soup, balances the flavor out.  My boyfriend had the Republic and he said it was pretty spicy, but his soup was a little lackluster for his tastes.  My little brother and sister enjoyed their tonkatsu meals but didn't like the mass of vegetables in their way of noodle paradise. Haha. All in all it was a nice experience. Quite a drive for some ramen though. We didn't wait too long for our boba drinks either. Probably because it wasn't that busy.   I will be returning. :)
5 This is my new favorite place!  You will love their ramen. My favorite is the Republic Ramen which is spicy but addicting as well. The Miso Ramen is great  if you don't like spicy and the Tonkotsu Ramen is delicious if you like a more sweet milky flavored broth. You can add whatever vegetables and extras you want to. The gyoza is great but I prefer mine steamed and they are able to accommodate that if you request it. The staff couldn't be more friendly. The service is fast. Don't miss out on the Boba tea. I get the Thai milk tea with boba, it is perfect. I am so happy this place exists.
5 This place is fantastic! I walked in expecting to see stereotype Asian decor but I was blown away! It's modernized decor fit the food perfectly, they have free WiFi and these cool long tables and tall chairs that at first the tables just look long for decoration, but then I realized it has another use: catches your flicks of soup so it doesn't land on another person (LOL)!  Okay, I'm getting ahead of myself here; ordering was a bit intimidating, since it was my first time here. My friend was with me and walked me through it, it was a breeze! The guy who took our orders was nice and chatty, we sat, and our food came out fast - I was pretty impressed with the setup, really nice, modernized, and delicious.  The ramen is flavorful, the bean sprout crunchy, the carrots crunchy, the spinach delicious, and the noodles are al dente and then when they sit in the bowl at the bottom, it soaks up the broth and the flavors of whatever else you ordered as another topping! My mouth is watering just thinking about it!
4 I haven't actually eaten my food here or eaten all of the dishes, but the ramen I have had here is extremely fucking tasty. The one problem I have is that there char siu is pretty thin. I've had ramen in a lot of countries and the standard for Japanese ramen is to cut the pork pretty thick (and throw an egg on top for bonus points). Granted I've only eaten here once but the pork was pretty thin....and I didnt hear anything about an egg. But i"m not ging to hold that against them. They have a great location, a clean shop, and a tasty menu. Will definitely be back as soon as I can convince my work lunch buddy to take me there :)
4 I have only had the tea here but it is pretty good and they are open late on the weekends! This is the only boba place open till 10 pm which is about the time I find myself craving a tea:) The staff is awesome! The place is clean and newly remodeled. They have a new expanded tea menu which is nice. The boba has never been "perfect" though, it is always a little too chewy and somewhat over cooked. A couple of times I have gotten teas where the boba was in a big solid lump at the bottom of my glass. Not optimal. BUT over all it is a good place with a great vibe.
5 always have really friendly staff, good food, very fast service, huge bowls of ramen/udon, and some good Thai iced tea (boba)  only wish they were closer so we could go more often!
4 Does the Republic Ramen cure the common cold? According to a friend endearingly known as Asian Bob it does.  After a short weekend in Seattle, I came back with the sniffles. Two weeks later and I'm not sure if it's a flu or allergies. Either way, my congested sinuses left me sounding a little like Elmer Fudd. Enter Asian Bob and his spicy remedy to clear out the last of this seasonal sickness.  I hadn't heard of Republic Ramen + Noodles located next to the Phoenix Rock Gym on Dorsey & University. I was surprised at the mod and clean layout - a far cry from the pizza place that used to be here. The staff knew exactly what I needed and soon a huge bowl of ramen was sitting in front of me.  I loved that it was full of spicy broth. It wasn't the hottest thing I've ever eaten, but over the next 12 hours it worked its magic. The next morning I woke up with a clear head and normal voice.  Thanks Republic Ramen!
5 Only true ramen joint in this cultureless barren wasteland known as Phoenix metropolitan area.  Enjoy it while you can, places like this doesn't have long life expectancy.
4 If you're like me, when you hear the word ramen you think about the packages of dried noodles with the flavor pack that you get at the grocery store five for a dollar. So walking into a restaurant that specializes in ramen, I didn't really know what to expect.  Luckily, the guy working behind the counter was nice enough to walk me through the various ramen options so I knew just what I was getting myself into.  This ramen is like the store bought stuff on steroids. First of all - they give you a ton! I couldn't even get through half of it. Secondly, it includes something the store stuff lacks - fresh ingredients. Mixed in with the noodles was spinach, carrots and I chose pork as my meat. The broth was flavorful and the noodles has a nice flavor and consistency. I would have liked more pork though. The meat to noodle ratio was a bit unbalanced.  I think this place is a good alternative to other asian restaurants and would make a great option for a quick and filling lunch.
4 This was pretty great. We came down from N. Phoenix just to check it out. The menu is pretty simple and great for the vegetarian in your family. I got the house, Republic Ramen, which was a little spicy but flavorful. The pork was thinly cut and I wish it was in a little smaller pieces. Star's vegetarian looked good. She got the tofu of course but only got 4 slices. The waiter made a point to mention that they were pan seared. She would have liked a few more slices after all the add tofu winds up being $.50 a slice. We walked away spending a little under $25 for two entrees an pp. of edamame and a 1 large Kirin. The broth makes a great second day soup with some buttered bread. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new experience at a reasonable price.
5 First and formost I will have you know I am an avid pho eater and Boba drinker. Coming from the Los Angeles area, I know what is good and what is not. This place is AWESOME! Service is fantastic. There is a server there named Tony who is extremely personable and makes delicious drinks-ask for him. The music is good and there is a nice vibe. The Shoyu is definitely my favorite bowl as well as the Thai Milk Tea! The boba is always soft. The restaurant is extremely clean and the workers take pride in their services there. They also have a wide variety of alcoholic beverages. This place is GREAT, I recommend it to all of my close friends. Also very reasonable prices.
4 Coming from Seattle with lots of good Japanese food, and moved to the desert, gives me a bit of pessimistic thoughts about this place. It is the only ramen place in Phoenix and just opened this March. We visited this place for lunch on Sunday. But after entering the door and feel the atmosphere, I had a good feeling already. The cashier was so passionate about his products and explained how the menu works in 3 minutes presentation, very impressive... I tried what he recommended , the tonkatsu noodle, the usual choice I make in Seattle. The price was cheap too for the huge portion they serve ($6.95/bowl). This is definitely a place to hang out if you want to not spend lots of money but still going home full.  I love his recommendation! And we tried the shrimp tempura appertizer as well, and the garlic sweet sauce is just addictive!  I recommend this place and definitely will come again!
4 Not much places you can find ramen in AZ. Republic Ramen or Tonkatsu is great, always get one of the two. The sides are small, too small and not worth getting in my opinion.
4 The noodles were good but the boba was my favorite! yummy :-)
4 Excellent and unique food, helpful and friendly employees and very reasonable prices.
4 Like many people, I grew up on cheap, 5/$1 Ramen noodles.  Everyone had their "special" way of making them in the hood and no two ways were the same.  However, until you have a real bowl of Ramen, you don't realize just how bad your version is!  Republic takes Ramen to another level.  The bowls are large, hot and stuffed with multiple fresh ingredients.  While the dine in experience is somewhat spartan, it is a perfect spot to sit and enjoy a nice lunch without the usual jammed packed scene that many University area restaurants enjoy.  The Boba menu is also a plus if you never had one - Try Green Apple.
3 ehhhhhh, i was really excited to have a ramen shop next to my house.. but honeslty i can't tell difference between their ramen and the frozen one.  Broth is so-so, and noodles... i think they use frozen. Their gyoza is not really worth it, neither is their fried rice.   I guess its okay, if your craving a quick grab, but kind of expensive for not good quality ramen.  Dose not taste ANYTHING like real ramen in Japan.   Their boba is pretty good though =D and staff is very friendly.
5 I discovered this place driving around Arizona State trying to find a cheap place for lunch.  As a ramen lover, it's difficult to find a good ramen place in the valley.  So when I saw a ramen place, I thought I'd try this one out.  Walking in gave me a hip trendy vibe.  It's definitely college friendly.  A modern look.  The menu has everything you'd expect in a ramen shop: regular ramen, spicy ramen, seafood, and vegetarian.  But the star of the show is definitely the Tonkotsu ramen.  Even the cashiers would recommend this choice.  It's a milky pork stock soup.  I ordered it with chashu (Japanese soysauce marinated) pork and egg.  The ramen was cooked perfectly: bouncy and not soggy.  The thinly sliced pork had just enough fat to be tender and flavorful.  When they served it, it came with bean sprouts and spinach.  Everything came together with the help of the broth.  Adding a bit of the red pepper gives it a good kick, but it doesn't overpower the flavor of the soup.  I definitely recommend anyone with a passion for ramen and Japanese food to try this place.  For those who are indecisive or unsure what to order.  Repeat after me to the cashier: Tonkotsu ramen with chashu pork and egg please!  5 star only b/c of the Tonkotsu.
5 Before I had visited this restaurant, ramen to me was the small packages at the grocery store which aren't that great. But at Republic Ramen, I had an opportunity to try something more authentic than those cheap packages at the store. The service was good, and the employee who helped us was very fluent in ramen knowledge. Afterwards, other employees were really nice in providing a take-home container.   Also, the atmosphere is nice and modern in style. I would recommend this place to anybody who would like to try restaurant-style ramen.
4 Nooodle Soup! Growing up, noodle soup was a staple in my family. From the 15 cent ramen packages, to the upgraded ramen/pho/vermicelli packages you would get at the Asian supermarket, to the real deal: Noodles made from scratch that my Nai Nai (grandma) would make.  Republic Ramen + Noodles really brought that soothing comfort food feel back, but without the guilt of prepackaged, processed, fried ramen. Nope these noodles are made fresh daily (or so the cashier told me with much enthusiasm when I asked him if the noodles were fried like the notorius 15 cent packages). Fresh ingredients of spinach, sprouts, and cute little petal shaped carrots to garnish your hot, steamy bowl.   The steps are simple: choose your broth, choose your protein, choose your add ins like egg, kimchi, or tofu. This place to me was genius. Noodle soup heaven and healthy to boot.  My favorite was the Tonkotsu ramen. I also tried the Shiro as well, but it was a bit too salty for my taste.  This place was right next door to the condo I rented out for Ironman Arizona. I enjoyed it so much I visited 3 times. Twice for noodle soup and once for the bubble tea. The snow drinks were a fantastic post race reward drink ( I had been eyeing them the week leading to the race). They were as good as I had imagined if not better.  Thanks RR for fueling me up with noodle soup goodness pre and post race!
4 Very big portions, with flavorful, distinct broth options.  My favorite broth so far is the tonkatsu ramen.  There are a lot of different add-ons you can put in the soup, and I was happy to see that they had tea eggs on the menu!  They also have bubble tea, but the tapioca I had tasted old and soggy, and it was very flavorless (taro milk tea).  The tempura is also very good- very crispy with fresh vegetables.
5 This place is phenomenal. I had my first visit around Halloween and have been back weekly ever since. I'm a huge fan of Kim Chee and these folks have nailed it. The coffees and teas they have next door are extremely good as well. I usually will take some back to the office after lunch.   Living in NYC, I used to love to hit St Mark's and enjoy some good ramen. I figured I had lost that opportunity upon moving here, but thanks to Republic, I"m back in business. Keep up the good food, I'll see you guys next week!
4 Ramen isn't like that foamy starch they serve in Styrofoam cups you get from the truck stop.  Ramen is a rich, thick broth with hearty noodles, delicious meat (or tofu), and some exotic add-ons to pull the whole experience together.  If you're a ramen fan, or just want to try something new and delicious in Tempe, visit Republic Ramen + Noodles.  This place serves dome fabulous ramen.  They also have a cafe that serves delicious milk tea.
4 I really enjoyed my experience here. Right when we walked in they guy at the counter was super helpful. He explained the menu to us, gave us his suggestions, and gave very detailed descriptions of everything they have. I had the tonkotsu ramen, spicy, and my dining companion had the republic ramen, spicy as well, both with pork. We grabbed our drinks (best iced tea ever!) and found a table. The place was modern, and most importantly very clean. Our orders arrived quickly in gigantic steaming bowls. While my fiances noodles were delicious, I defiantly out ordered him, my tonkotsu broth was heavenly. I loved all the veggies and the noodles were just right. And we both had enough for lunch the next day!    By the way, Ive been twice now and Ty has been working the counter both times. I hope the rest of the employees are even half as friendly and knowledgeable as he is! Every time I have a question he gives a very informative answer and always seems to be pretty passionate about it too.
5 Authentic ramen with superb flavor! My fiance and I moved to Phoenix from West L.A. where we frequented a place called Kinchan's Ramen.  We visited Republic Ramen and didn't expect it to measure up to our old neighborhood favorite, but it certainly surprised us! Great taste, great value, and knowledgeable, friendly counter help to boot. Staff is happy to help you customize your order. If it is your first time having ramen, don't be afraid to consult the staff for help understanding the various flavors and options- they are super helpful and know their ramen!
5 I was unsure to expect when i arrived here since it was my first time. The guy at the front was very helpful because i told him it was my first time and had no clue how to order.  I chose my broth which was the spicy one and added beef, corn etc.  It was huge and more than i was expecting.  It was really good.  We ordered Gyoza for our little one and edemame which was a great choice.  It is very nice and clutter free inside.  I ate everything in sight because it was so good. I will definitely be back before i move out of town. I hope to find a place like this in CA.
1 I'm going to keep this short and sweet. I ordered miso ramen and they gave me shoyu. I immediately knew that it wasn't miso because it lacked miso's distinct foggy hue and traces of fermented bean paste.  I have grown accustomed to the unique look of miso broth after having lived in Chiba/Tokyo for 3 years.  When I took my bowl to the service counter, the attending chef told me that because their miso has no MSG, it isn't as potent as "regular" miso. I have had MANY types of miso, and none of them taste like bland greasy salt water. Rather than own up to his mistake, the chef lied to my face. To make the situation worse, as I left the restaurant I saw a fellow customer enjoying genuine miso broth ramen.
2 A less-than-stellar attempt at something that should be in the realms of instant noodles rather than fresh ramen. Listen, I'm all for the underdog but to cut corners and inflate prices will do nothing but hurt business in the long run. On my particular visit, they were out of pork and chicken. Really? Out of pork at a ramen house? So we opt for the spam and beef. The beef I kid you not was 3 slices of deli roast beef. I AM DEAD SERIOUS! What kind of place are you running here? I mean I understand eclectic is good at times but roast beef in ramen? The noodles were Zeppelinly overcooked and then there's the heavily MSG fortified Tonkotsu and "Republic" soup that lacked any depth or long simmered flavor but sufficed in the dry soup packet flavor and an induction of food coma the makers of Ambien would show devout interest in. Overall, there's an aberrant discontinuity of flavors here at this establishment and I was unimpressed and unmotivated to come again. Either cut your prices (after all you're in college-town) or pack up your soup packets and take it elsewhere.
4 I was quite skeptical of Republic Ramen at first--not because of how it looked, smelled, or what I had heard but because why would there be a restaurant charging 8 dollars for what I can make for .14 cents?  Man was I wrong. My friends invited me and when I showed up I was happily surprised by the very clean restaurant. Couples sat in the back eating and drinking sake. The lady at the counter was very friendly and when I asked for an explanation of the menu she was very helpful.   The menu works something like this: pick your broth (they have 5 or 6), then pick the meat. The vegetables are standard but they do have some extras including kimchi!  And the kimchi was amazing, the perfect amount of spice. And it tasted great when put into the ramen.   The goyza and tempura were amazing and after finishing them I only wanted more. I got their standard ramen with chicken and while the chicken was a tad dry (overcooked) the taste of the broth and the freshness of the vegetables more then made up for it.  Though I've only been once I plan on going again, to try some of their other broths.
2 This place is so failsauce compared to that of real ramen.  The noodles were reminiscent of instant noodles more so than actual ramen.  The broth served was barely lukewarm.  It seemed as if they just melted a few bouillon cubes rather than it being cooked from actual ingredients.  I went there all excited that Arizona had a place dedicated to ramen and left so disappointed.   I really wanted to love the place.   The seaweed salad and kimchi were quite good however but again for a place that is titled Republic Ramen, one would think the focus would be on the actual ramen.  If you go to Ranch Market you can buy the Asian instant noodles and have a better tasting experience.    Although Toh San isn't great by any means - it was MUCH better than Republic Ramen.   If you get a chance to visit NYC - please visit Ippudo.  It'll introduce you to real ramen.
3 Coming from O.C./ Irvine area, I've been craving good beef noodle. Looked this place up and saw the great reviews, I thought I had to try it!   To my disappointment it was nothing like I had expected. I mean the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything really.... I asked for super spciy... and it wasn't really spicy at all... it was really just kind of plain.  A lot of broth, not enough noodles... that's all I have left to say about this place.
5 Republic Ramen is amazing! I love all the broth flavors, and the variety of add-ins. And their cafe is great too! Excellent boba, and coffee as well
5 Republic Ramen + Noodle gave me hope.  Why?  Well, when I left the SF Bay area a while back, the thing I dreaded leaving most was all the amazing privately-owned restaurants and hidden ma-n-pa joints that serve up delicious, authentic food.  Republic Ramen soothed my fear a lil though, since they dish out a pretty tasty bowl of ramen.  In fact, their Shoya ramen is just as good as my regular order back in Cali - butter corn ramen.  (I did have to add corn to it though and would love to see a butter corn option on the Republic menu one day.)      The restaurant is clean, freshly decorated and service was efficient (order and pay at front counter, they bring your food).  Those facts, combined with the fact that the ramen was so good (and they have kimchi sides), give Republic 5 stars!  See ya there!
3 Ordered the republic ramen with tofu and it tasted bland.  My husband got the republic ramen with spam and it tasted much better than mine.  His had a nice sweet flavor, which is what I would recommend.
4 I really have become a fan of this place. I have tried a couple different soups (although like a few others when ordering miso got somethings else once), the gyoza, boba and coffee.  Everything is very tasty I just love the beef Republic ramen with a bit of sesame chili oil added. For the price it is a good filling meal and when you add the $1 off coupon from the campus discount books its perfect. The gyoza are great crisp but not too crisp and the flavor and the flavor of the sauce is great and at 3 for $2 not a bad little side dish with the soup.  They also make a pretty good mocha which I tried the other day and the boba's are fun but I have only had the thai tea version.  The staff here is very good too they are super helpful if you aren't sure what you want, get things out quickly, if its not packed check in on you (rare for a counter order place) and they are just good all around.
4 We're lucky to have Republic R+N in the Valley, let alone Tempe. It's an amazing ramen cafe - with six different broths and a dozen different add-ins from which to choose. Plus they just expanded the menu to include other classic fast Japanese favorites - curry, udon combos, etc. The space is beautiful, and the employees - every last one of them - are so friendly and helpful and accommodating. This is such a five star place!!!!  Minor quibbles - extra spicy broth is almost indistinguishable from normal broth, and the curry is not traditional Japanese curry. It's OK, but not what you'd expect. Major quibble - what they charge for protein is simply outrageous. A few sprinklings of chicken, a few slices of pork or beef, a few cubes of tofu = two dollars added on??? An already pricey $7 bowl becomes a $10 bowl including tax because a (very) little protein is added? Unless this is Kobe beef, this is outrageous. Penny wise and pound foolish guys - triple the protein you serve or cut its price in half. The current pricing is crazy.  C'mon guys - you're so five stars, just fix the protein problem! In the meantime, dear reader, this is still a place to relish at any price.
4 I had seen this place for months, and me and my friends finally stopped in for a try. It was pretty good! When you first walk in the doors it looks very modern. The menu is right behind the register in big print, you order, then sit down and wait to be served. The portions they give are fair to their prices (although the add-ons for the ramen are a little expensive) and you definitely feel full once you're done with your bowl. I tried the miso ramen and I enjoyed it. A couple things I didn't like; The boba tea. It's alright. I had gotten almond milk tea, and at first taste, it was weird. I could only taste the almonds and milk, hardly the tea, and the boba was very, very chewy. Eventually the drink grew on me a little more, but I have doubts on trying a milk tea again off their boba menu. Another thing, and this was just me personally- I had gotten miso ramen with tofu, but the tofu wasn't really satisfying. I was expecting the tofu to have warmed up and absorbed more of the miso flavor, however it was lukewarm, and just tasted like tofu. But thinking about this later, I realize that it's not miso soup with tofu already in it, they only put the tofu in when requested. But that was something I found a little disappointing. One final thing: I wasn't sure if I should tip or not. they bring out your food and take your plates away, but I hadn't seen anyone else in the restaurant tip, nor anyone at my table. I had tipped anyway, but I completely lost on whether I should have or not. This was actually very close to only getting 3 stars, but I'm giving it 4 with the benefit of the doubt that I'll try it again and like it even better next time.
3 The portions are okay.  I didn't think the gyoza were great.  tasted a bit freezer burned (dry) and they looked deep fried which was weird.  Lots of people come in, a testament to their popularity.  A good mix of locals, college students, hipsters and whatnot all congregate to get a bowl of steaming noodles.  The ramen is what you want, the udon and soba are only okay.  (i.e. you can make those items yourselves).  They come pretty plain and you pay for additional toppings and accoutraments.  The tempura is good, just greasy enough but only comes with a meager three pieces.  the service is spotty, the hostess/receptionist has a tendency to mix up orders, having her read back your order is a must.  Its not the super cheap meal that you would expect for ramen, but it is pretty tasty.  the place is trendy, bright with piped in techno style music.  I didn't feel like I was in the middle of tempe despite having just stepped in from the stripmall location in the nondescript side of Tempe.
4 It took a few visits to find the ramen I liked best, but they are all good. Very sizable portions, and quick service. Employees are very friendly and I enjoy making regular trips.
3 Well at least they don't use crappy cup o' noodles right?  I got my ramen to go, i don't know if that affected my quality? Anyways lets get down to business... I got the Republic Ramen, its named after the place it has to be good.... well it's nothing to rave about really. The broth was pretty good though, nice spice but not over powering. I think i would most likely try some of their other stuff because that one either just wasn't me, nor did i think it was that "four star" amazing which people are raving.   The toppings are really skimpy and cheap for a ramen place that charges as much as they do. Don't bother getting a side it is way too expensive for just 2-3 pieces.   Don't get me wrong i'd go back.. but i don't think i will be going back because i crave them...not good enough to have me crave it. and the price, get a drink and a side and your tab jumps up...stay with just the ramen and drink water, there is enough sodium in there anyways.  Um drinks are really expensive here too, thought it would be cheaper since its right next to one of the biggest universities. guess they are trying to draw in a different crowd. The ASU flag hanging was really tacky btw. the store decor was nice besides that, had some nice flat screens to watch some game while you take your "boo" or "shorty" out somewhere besides that pub.
4 Tried the spicy ramen with egg and beef.  I lived in Tokyo and I have tried many different types of ramen.  I didn't have high expectations but I thought it was good.  I will definitely go there again.
4 I give this place a four star, just because it give pretty ok ramen, at the location, Tempe. You can't really find real Japanese food around Tempe,  It was interesting how we can chose our meat from, pork,beef, tofu, spam, and chicken. normally pork would be the best choice (chashu) but it's an idea to have little different taste for ramen. Definitely coming back, when I visit Tempe
3 In the grand scheme of Phoenix area noodle shops, this place is average.  I ordered the spicy tonkatsu soup with chicken for lunch one day this week - it came out piping hot and in a huge bowl.  The spice was subtle but definitely present, and the cloudy pork broth had pretty good flavor.  The noodles were what was most mediocre in my mind - they were a little chewy and definitely weren't as good as Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe's.  Toppings were light (compared to the picture next to the menu board) but adequate.  I may come back, but for a noodle lunch near work I definitely prefer Khai Hoan.
5 This place is AWESOME!  I could there everyday no problem.  It's super inexpensive and they bring you a huge bowl, enough to feed 2, but you'll find that you continually keep eating no matter how full you are because it's so good.  The ramen has so much flavor and it's delicious with all the fresh veggies.  AND they offer Boba tea which is another bonus.  Check this place out if you're looking for something tasty and cheap.
4 I encountered this place when I went to the Phoenix Rock Gym and was excited to try it! I moved here from California not too long ago and was missing the delicious ramen places back home. I got the Republic Ramen and a black milk tea with boba. The people who work there are excellent! Great service, quick, and really friendly. The style is kinda modern with a cool hang out vibe. (not sure if that is a thing but I'm making it one :))  The republic ramen was tasty. It is a little spicy. Comes with 5 or 6 slices of the meat of your choice, fresh spinach, and fresh bean sprouts. I thought the flavor was decent but missing a little something savory about it, but still overall good. I might be a little skewed because I haven't had ramen for a while and was craving it. But, I would definitely go back.  The boba was the highlight for me. The tapioca balls were a perfect balance of chew not old and hard like most of the places around here. The milk tea was a perfect amount of sweet unlike other bobas that make me feel like one sip and I'll go into instant diabetic shock.   Overall I love this place!
2 We went here for a team dinner with a group from UCLA. Our group loves ramen, that's one of our things. This place is very nice and spacious, lots of room and has a modern-esque look to it. I ordered the Ramen Republic and had a taste of the Tonkatsu Ramen.  The Ramen Republic was "spicy" but honestly, if you're a person who loves spicy food, you're going to have to dump some of their spicy seasoning in there. Overall, I thought the taste and flavor wasn't so bad; the tonkatsu was very brothy and had a good pork flavor, the ramen republic had good flavor but wasn't spicy. I wasn't a big fan of their noodles, too hard in my opinion. Also, there are only 2 slices of pork (or any other meat)... which is simply not enough if you want to enjoy something hearty and delicious like ramen. Great thing is that they have a good portion for their ramen noodles. You can add more but it'll cost you a dollar or two! However, the taste and noodles are just not up to par with some of the LA ramen places.  The staff was extremely friendly and great to us. There was one guy who had just started that day that I wouldn't have known if he never told me. Really great service especially with a group as large as ours (~30 people).  Had a good time there though!
3 I would take Republic Ramen for what it is- fast food ramen priced inexpensively, located in the heart of a college town.   There is, unfortunately, a huge dearth of good ramen places here in Phoenix. When my girlfriend told me about this, I was keen on checking it out. I love Cherry Blossom, but it gets a bit boring to have that be the only joint in town I enjoy ramen at! Also, nothing helps clear blocked allergies like hot ramen and a steaming cup of green tea!   I got the tonkatsu ramen, whilst the boyfriend got the miso ramen. I had no complaints about mine. It wasn't rocking my proverbial world, but it was good decent food. It tasted like tonkatsu broth, and I liked the fresh spinach, bean sprouts and the egg I paid extra for.   His miso ramen, however, was very disappointing. A friend had warned me that this was 'white people ramen', and his ramen lived up to that warning. It tasted like bland, straight up soy sauce broth. No trace of miso at all. I actually forgot he had miso stock and not the soy sauce before he reminded me about it.   The gyoza were also nicely edible, but nothing to go home talking about.   As I said, take it for what it is. Fast food ramen in a college town. It's good to satisfy your cravings, but not something that will rock your world. Not everything can be 5 stars. My suspicion is that you'll find just such mediocre ramen places even in Japan.
4 I can't believe a Japanese person could eat an entire bowl of this ramen but the waitperson insisted it is authentic. I have to give it to them -- it's the best ramen I've ever had!  When you walk in, there's a certain way of ordering. You pick a base soup and then add ingredients. If you are having any trouble figuring it out, the helpful staff, with names like Shiloh and Moonbeam will be glad to help you out.  The huge bowls are reasonably priced and extremely filling, so if you order a side dish, you can forget about finishing. Probably better to go in knowing you'll come out with half of it left over for dinner.
4 I have never had REAL ramen until I came here. I had been raised thinking ramen was just noodles in a package that you boil for 3 minutes and add the contents of a silver packet (predominately made of sodium), and voilà!   This place is fantastic delicious offering ramen, udon and rice dishes with fresh ingredients for about 6.50 an item. The servings are absolutely huge, but fantastic.    My boyfriend and I tried this place out on a Saturday night a few weeks ago. It was quiet inside, but the cashier explained they just finished with their dinner rush.  I ordered the miso ramen and my boyfriend got the curry rice with a side order of goyoza. There were three goyoza to an order, and to be honest, they were small for the price.  The miso ramen and the curry rice were both very good.   We went there a week later (due to a hankering of mine) and decided to share a bowl of the republic ramen along with edamame and veggie tempura. All of it was delish.   The only downside to the restaurant is that it smells like a grease fryer.  When we left, our clothes stank like grease.     Other than the smell of grease, the place is fantastic.
3 Arizona? Japanese food? Ramen?   Ramen in...Arizona?  That is correct, boys and girls, ramen exists in Tempe, Arizona.  And it's actually not to far from the likes of the famous ramen joints in CA. I had a taste of the tonkatsu and miso ramen, and they were both pretty flavorful, with an O-kay broth. The noodles, like Angela Y. says, aren't too amazing. They're hard and the consistency is too instant-rameny for my liking. I had the curry and let me just say... the portions are humongous! Split 50/50 between curry (potatos, curry sauce, and carrots) and white rice, this thing will fill you up like no other. However, the curry's nothing more than the stuff you can make out of instant packets and microwavable meals.   The restaurant is large and accommodated our group of 30+ people very well. Service was spot on, though the register took some time due to credit card processing waits. Our servers brought our bowls out consistently and quickly, and everything came out freshly cooked.   GOOD: Portions, price, service Not too great: Ramen noodles
3 Grew up on instant ramen, had ramen in New York at some hole in the wall Japanese place where we literally got seated in a closet, found out there was a ramen place south of me in Tempe.  The staff is nice and service is quick. I had a big get together here with around 15 people and everyone got served fairly quickly. As for the food itself, it's a step up from the cups of instant noodles, but nothing special.
5 Soooooo goooood!!!!!!!!!!! My fiance and I went here for the first time a couple weeks ago. The girl at the counter was extremely helpful in explaining their options, and you get soooooo much soup for the price! I have to admit, i liked my fiance's better, so i'm definitely going to try it next time. I had the house broth, and it was very good, a little spicy. He had the broth that was a little more milky and it was very good, especially after adding a little sriracha. I highly recommend them if you're in the mood for some delicious comfort food.
2 The food was decent. The service was fairly good, and the friendly staff helped explain the menu. But really - I can make this at home. What makes it so special?
4 Good ramen, the noodles are okay, but the broth is always delicious. Lots of add ins, and lots of choices. I get something a little different every time I go. Staff is very nice and helpful, and the prices aren't too bad. Only wish it were closer to me in Phoenix, but when I go to Tempe, I always make a stop here.
3 I have been on the look out for a solid ramen house in the Phoenix metro area. This isn't it.  It's not bad. It's just okay. The noodles were the best part, and the staff who took our order said they special order the fresh ramen noodles from LA. The broth (I had the Spicy Republic) was also pretty good, if not a tiny bit over salted. However, I'm used to real ramen, where the bowl is rich with vegetables, herbs, bean sprouts, meat, tofu, etc.  Here, you get noodles and broth and just a few small pieces of carrot, a handful of bean sprouts, a handful of spinach, and whatever protein you choose. THEN, you can add on for $0.50 an item what is typically already in the bowl at a traditional ramen house.   We also ordered the Japanese curry - also just okay. There isn't anything bad to say about it, but there wasn't anything to rave about either.  Cleanliness and customer-friendly service here were 5 stars - greeted when we came in, the server/cashier explained everything he knew about the menu and made pleasant suggestions. I saw him and the other server do the same thing with all of the other people waited on, so they are also consistent with their excellent service.   I'd definitely go back, but I know what to expect now. It's a good bowl of noodle soup, but it wasn't the ramen I was craving.
4 I'm a big noodle and ramen fan.  This is a terrific place so far.  I've only tried a couple of their dishes but have not been disappointed yet.  Their default republic ramen dish is pretty solid and has good flavor.  I'd like to get back and try some of the others.  It would be nice if they possibly offered some of their dishes with a choice of noodles but being a ramen house they specialize in that type.  Very friendly staff and great portions for the price.  It would probably be best to add extra addins but then the price does tend to go up.  All in all it's a solid place for some good ramen.
5 Great food and an awesome atmosphere, staff is extremely friendly and the prices are reasonable.
5 Love love love this place.  It is fresh, clean, and affordable.  The portions are so a friend and I can share an entree (we always get the Tonkatsu and spice it up with the Sriracha sauce) and the service is always great or exceptional.  Boba is always tasty, and I hear the special summer menu is coming...can't wait!
4 I came here on Friday with a dire craving for Soba Noodles. I have never had Soba Noodles, before and I have been yearning it since watching a rerun of Iron Chef Japan the other night. Upon glancing over the menu I decided to order Shrimp Tempura Soba, $6.95 a Squid Salad $3 and bought a soda. All of which came to $15 bucks with tip. Not a bad deal at all IMO.  I began with the Squid Salad. A more than generous portion of Squid I thought for the price. It was cooked and marinated quite nicely. Next up, the main dish. The Tempura came on the side as 2 Shrimp Tempura and a piece of Carrot Tempura. The Tempura batter was actually quite nice, no complaints there. Now for the Soba. It came in a huge piping hot bowl. The broth was very clean, fresh, and enjoyable. The Soba Noodles tasted good I thought. I can't give a comparison to other Soba Noodles though, so I don't know if they were great of terrible as far as Soba is concerned, but I had no complaints. This is one of those things where I have to try numerous Soba Noodles to make a valid argument. But as far as I'm concerned it didn't disappoint. The one odd thing I thought though was that I did not see one Japanese employee in there. Kind of quirky, but oh well. This is a solid meal at a good value.
5 I'm Chinese, and I have traveled to Japan many times...this is some of the best ramen in America I have ever had! I had to move away, but while I was living there I was literally at Republic Ramen every single day. Their boba is fresh and flavorful, their edamame is perfectly prepared, and each of their ramen dishes is absolutely wonderful. My personal favorite was the miso ramen with naruto, pork, and the usual toppings with a black milk tea. Everyone who works there is super nice and chill, always friendly and courteous.   It just doesn't get better than this!
5 Great food, great people, great atmosphere.... i could go on! My daughter loves boba snow and Tony makes it the best. They have tons of teas too! The RAMEN IS VERY YUMMY! Plenty to share with someone!
4 I'm a big foodie, and I love noodles, my single favorite dish in the world is Pho. Ever since learning about real ramen, I've been dying to try it. I chose to get the Shoyu Ramen with pork and egg topping. It was actually really good. A little heavy on the sprouts and spinach, but overall really good. Paired it with a Fire Rock beer (probably should have got boba). I can't compare it to anything else, since this was my first time, but I would have it again, trying miso or shio. However, the ramen here doesn't hold a candle in the wind to a hot bowl of Pho. On a side note, if you're really into ramen, watch Anthony Bourdain's episode about it, Ramen Girl with the late Brittany Murphy, and read David Chang's first issue of Lucky Peach magazine.
4 Um... Yum! This place was surprisingly good. I have had ramen (real ramen) one other time in Seattle, and I thought it was alright, but this was really good! I got the shio broth, which was good, kind of a standard clear broth, and I added garlic and got chicken in it. The guy at the counter was super helpful, and he helped me pick out what to put in the soup... he didn't even seem (that) annoyed by all of my questions either, so that was nice. I really liked the way they garnished the soup, it had spinach, carrot, sprouts, and green onions. It looked really colorful and added some dimension to the soup. I added some of their spicy seasoning stuff and it was good. The noodles were really tasty, they were just the right texture for ramen, a little chewy. Gotta like that! Also, the chicken surprised me in how good it was! It looked not so great in the bowl, but when I tried it, it was so tender... like infused with the broth and melting in my mouth.... so good. The portion size is huge, I couldn't finish it. I will definitely come back here... if it was good in the summer, I can only imagine it will be great in the winter!
2 I am a HUGE ramen fan...came to Phoenix for a quick 1 day visit and had to try the ramen in AZ.  Following the reviews on yelp, i decided to give this place a try.  Big mistake.  Ok, it's not horrible - but ramen is hard to mess up on.  I have had really really good ramen and this is nothing even close to it.
3 I enjoyed my food and will likely go back.  It is a good/simple thing to feed to the kids as well.  For $6.95 you get a huge bowl of ramen.  I got the vegetarian one with tofu.  They also have rice (gluten free) noodles.  Add a bit of the sarrachi sauce and it was tasty.  I couldn't finish the whole bowl.  Perhaps that has something to do with the $2 happy hour plate of vegetable tempura I ate... or the chocolate strawberry snow with boba that I had.  The boba is not as good as the one from The Boba House in Chandler.... a tiny bit dry in the middle.  Also, I had ordered a coconut strawberry drink and they accidentally made chocolate strawberry.  I didn't mind and drank it anyway.  Kinda wished I had the coconut instead but it was still good.
5 Great ramen. Spent a year in Japan and this reminded me of being there. Will be going back.
3 I'm not super into ramen, but I've been eyeballing this place for months every time I pass it. Today, it was time to finally give it a try.  I got the republic ramen with pork. The menu says that every ramen dish comes with spinach, sprouts, scallions and carrots. My order came with most of this, except the carrots. Instead, I got carrot. 1 tiny piece of a carrot. Haha.. that's a bit of a shame considering I love carrots. I wasn't expecting  a lot, but it was literally just a tiny nickel-sized piece of carrot. The broth was not terribly flavorful. The portion size was generous enough that I can get two meals out of it, which is nice for the price.  I also got the veggie tempura side, which is usually 3 dollars, but was only 2 because I came during happy hour. It was pretty good- highlight of my lunch/dinner.  The boba I got was definitely the best part. It might not be the greatest boba ever, but I'm not exactly a connoisseur so it seemed pretty damn good to me. I got the Thai milk tea, and it was super delicious with a generous portion of boba. Very refreshing on a hot summer day.  The staff was very friendly.  All in all.. I think I might try some other dishes here, but I probably won't come back for the ramen. Will definitely return for tea.
1 DISSAPPOINTED!! I ordered the TONKOTSU ramen with chyashu pork of course, but they ran out of pork!!! So I supplemented with egg and chicken.  Soup was thin and flavorless, egg over cooked, chicken bland, the bean sprouts, and spinach was not helpful or wanted! I make better instant ramen at home! Having had unforgettable ramen from Japan and very good ramen in Hawaii and irresistable ramen in Vegas even.... I'm sad AZ ramen is embarrassing.
4 Pretty good and inexpensive, especially if you're willing to share a bowl (they're more than big enough for two people).  The chicken gets VERY overcooked because of the heat of the soup. I'd suggest a different meat. I also love to add corn and an egg.
2 this place is no where close to anything you can get in la or oc. It taste liked it came out of the bag. plain and simple
4 I am not going to share my giant noodle soup bowl with anyone. Nor am I going to share my Boba with anyone.     Soup:  nice presentation, not too salty.  Not too hot, nor cold;  just right to dig in right away.  Pick your broth;  I'm a salt o holic, and even then, I added more salt and spice to my broth, so sue me and pass me the hypertensive pill.   Gyoza:  could eat more;  please give more.     Boba pearls:  nice chewy consistency;  not overdone or underdone.  No aspiration pnemonia here;  could be a bit colder in temp, but that's probably because I waited to drink it after I ate the bowl of ramen.     Beggars can't be choosers;  the Ramen here is decent.  It's better than the 49 cent kind (inflation you know) and far worse than the noodle houses in Japan--what do you expect, it's the DESERT for heaven's sake.     For college kids:  what a great intro to far east staple food.
3 It was good. Very clean place, with decent service and okay prices. I had the signature Republic Ramen. It was good, but I added some spice to it. My wife and stepson enjoyed theres more than I did mine. Portions are a good size.   I don't know, I thought it was good, but not great. There is nothing wrong with the place, but I doubt I will come here very often. Give it a try, by all means, but don't expect something spectacular.
3 It was our first time so I asked the blonde at the counter what was good.  She said she didn't know since she doesn't eat the food. Um. Ok.    I ended up ordering the miso ramen, which a huge mistake.  It was so salty and just had a really weird taste to it.  I couldn't even finish it.  The husband tried the tonkotsu ramen with beef which he enjoyed. Our friend came late and ordered the same thing but the blonde said, "we're out of beef."  So then my friend said, "is the chicken or charsiu better then?"  Her answer, "That's all we have...is chicken or charsiu left."  Um. ok.   Though my food experience was not the best, my husband enjoyed his, and I'd like to  come back if we're ever on that side of town again to try the tonkotsu or the udon.  I'm willing to give it another try.  But they need a better hostess at the front because she was absolutely clueless.
4 Pretty good! Had the basic udon. Reasonably priced, tasty food and the resturant is pretty cool. 4 stars because it didn't blow my socks off
4 Grew up on Ramen, Udon & Soba.  So, saw the ad for this place; really wanted to try.  Ramen was very good; the broth was very flavorful.  Wish the Char chiu was more authentic to my JA taste.  My roommate tried the Soba; it was excellent.  Will be back to try the udon or the soba.  They need to have oshinko or tsukemeno as a side dish.  Maybe I'll bring my own next time...LOL
3 I'd been eating here for over a year, but recently something has changed.  I still like it, but it isn't the meal that has drawn me to eat there as often as I had been before.
4 4th star goes for all the boba you get!! Being a boba milk tea fan, I was delighted when I discovered they added more amount in this place.  This is like having pho, but Japanese style. Fast service, good portions and tasty.
2 Used to be so good! We loved this place. We ate there weekly at least once, but frequently more than that. We were regulars. Only place we found that was better was on the beach in Hawaii and that was half because of the view. But they recently their kitchen staff walked out and they haven't recovered. The broth is now too onion-y and the meat is really dry. I mean REALLY DRY! It had been sooo good but just not any more. Management really needs to think about how they are handling things.
2 You order with a grouch blonde college girl using an ipad2 but they cant afford to actually put toppings on your ramen.  Bull.  I will go until someone recommends better ramen places in Phoenix. I'm from San Francisco (Can make that bold?) don't give me this oily tonkatsu with 2 measly pieces of thinly sliced cold  tough pork.  In all fairness, its not bad ramen, but this isn't how it is supposed to be done.   The product should match the photos on the website at the least... It does not.
3 This place was good. The Republic Ramen dish was good and spicy. Straight to the point menu. Everyone said the Boba is good but I didn't get a chance to try it.  The smell in there kind of put me off but my Husband didn't think anything of it.  If you look close at things inside...things look really thrown together. Lots of cover ups and patches on the walls. I suppose that doesn't affect the food.  Id go back... the noodles were awesome...
3 Finally I tried their noodle soups, and the taste of broth is good, the amount of noodles overwhelming and more veggies than a pho. HOWEVER, I was able to count the pieces of meat...TWO!   No wonder why students go here, I guess they don't realize the difference. The boba thing...It seems that first time I was just lucky!.
4 Found my BOBA spot!  They have Snow, Slush & Tea options. The are generous with the tapioca balls inside.  The staff is very knowledgeable too about Boba flavors and combinations.  Average price around $3.50.
2 Where to start...  I used to like this place a lot and I came here often. Not sure if they changed management, but the place no longer has coupons anywhere so it's extremely overpriced. Don't be fooled by the $2 gyoza dumplings; they're the size of a quarter and there's only 3. Also, if the girl asks you if you want garlic, say no because she doesn't tell you that it's 50 cents extra and you'll never taste the difference.   The flavor of the broth is good, decent portion sizes. It's better to order without meat, because I've tried all their meats and they're all pretty terrible, dry, and tough. Their chicken is actually kind of gross. Even though ramen is supposed to have a lot of toppings, only order toppings if you want to spend over 10 dollars for a bowl of noodles because each one is about $1, and they're not very good and in small portions.  Their tempura is pretty good and the best deal on the menu is the udon with tempura. Their boba is pretty good for Arizona.  However, I have some issues with their customer service, the last two times I've been they've over charged me by adding things like eggs that I didn't want and then would not take it off my charge. Their staff is pretty rude in general, so I probably won't go back because I seriously value an overall experience.  A little disappointing because it is in a great location and there aren't many ramen places around.
4 For Arizona- 4 stars, 3 stars if compared to L.A.  My b.f.f., seriously I've known her since I was 5, wanted to show me this place. She knows I love ramen and warned me ahead of time that it wasn't L.A. standards. We walked in for lunch right when they opened. She ordered me a tonkatsu ramen with spam.  One of her two friends that had joined us said, "really, spam?" "Um.... yeah, you know, the canned meat? There's even spam rolls in Hawaii, musubi. Did I just blow your mind?  The boys were talking about chess and I mentioned I was in a chess club in elementary school. They both looked up startled and Jenni started laughing and said, "Yeah, she's a big nerd and I used to balance her out, but I lost control over this when she moved to LA". Now she does things like book clubs and Yelp.   I endured what seemed like endless questioning on all things Yelp. "What do you do on Yelp? Will you be reviewing our house later? Can we find you on Yelp and leave comments?"  Ah.... Arizona...... need I say more?  So back to my ramen, definitely not traditional, average noodles, and broth lacked depth. They did get the saltiness right and overall the taste was decent. I liked their space- clean, high ceilings, big windows, and modern decor. Worth a revisit when I'm in the desert and have 400+ miles between me and LA ramen.
5 The shoyu broth ramen was fantastic. This totally hit the spot. I'll definitely be going back frequently in the near future.
4 New favorite lunch spot. An unbelievable amount of food at a reasonable price. I have lived in Japan and I can honestly say this is the real deal. It is delicious and authentic. You don't really need to know any more. Just go.
1 What an abomination! For soup noodles its pretty decent but please don't advertise it as ramen. Its more like instant ramen that you can get for 75 cents with tiny bits of meat that you end up paying 8 dollars for. If I can make it better at home then we have a problem...
1 Add instant ramen, add a slice of beef, commercialize it as hip, sell for 8 dollars = Satanism. No Thank You Republic Ramen, No Thank You and Never Again.
4 This place is the only thing I can eat if I am hungover or a cold.  Wish there were more places like it
5 After getting a massage (and propositioned by two naked Asian "massage therapists")  (Oh no I din't!!!)  ~just massage my feet please~  I headed over here to try the veggie Ramen, and I have to say it was very tasty.  Almost as tasty as the intoxicating blonde who took my order.  Too bad she wasn't on the dessert menu.  All in all, a happy ending for sure.
4 I thought that I could only get some good noodles here on the East Coast but boy was I wrong! I cant stop thinking about how good it was. Next time I am in town, Im heading straight there!
4 I am an avid ramen noodle lover. The options were fantastic. I ordered the Chili Pepper Ramen "traditional style" and added an egg and off the menu spicy. Very few restaurants are willing to really make a dish spicy. I typically order this way at Thai restaurants and only 1 out of 5 of my favorite places has produced a dish that needed no extra spice. Republic ramen came through in the spice department. The tofu was not too squishy or soggy - just right and the veggies were not over cooked.  My bf had the Shoyu Ramen - original style - great flavor - no extra spice. We also had the seaweed salad which was also one of the best we've had. The seaweed flavor was not too strong. Finally, we had boba tea's - traditional black tea flavor. They were good, the flavor/consistency was not the best we've had - seemed a bit watered down, but would probably still stop by and grab one if we were in the area.
2 I'm not a fair judge of Republic Ramen.   I have had amazing ramen too many times now and when I go to a shop specializing in ramen, if it's not pretty great, then I can't help but hate it. They have "tonkotsu ramen" on the menu too so that alone sets expectations.  I ordered the "tonkotsu ramen" and hated it. Broth was weak with no depth of flavor. Noodles had no chew. As much as I hoped to love it, I was completely let down.  To be fair, I don't believe there is any decent tonkotsu ramen in Arizona.   I just don't see why this shouldn't be a concept that can be executed adequately here. For me, with the ramen I've had and love, it definitely wasn't.  Again, I'm not a fair judge of ramen. I'm mean and nasty about it. It's like sushi or uni. Once you elevate your expectations by having the stellar stuff, the mediocre doesn't cut it anymore.   And where I can eat American style sushi when I adjust my expectations (happy for crunch rolls and California rolls), can't do it for ramen.  If you're not passionate about ramen though, it's fine to ignore me. If you don't have amazing authentic ramen to hold it up to, it's probably fine.
5 The noodles were the best and ginger honey green tea nice a sweetened to perfection. A great place to go on those nights you don't feel like cooking and a good healthy serving filled w fresh veggies. A kid friendly place too
4 Who knew Ramen could be so much fun? I came here for the first time last night with John C, and I absolutely loved it!  Both of us had not been feeling well lately, and he suggested we come here to self medicate and that the food was awesome.  I loved it!    I really like how this place is decorated.  It feels comfortable, with benches and chairs, plenty of seating and a fair amount of room to move in.  No blasting music, very relaxing, but it feels clean and nice.  Anyways, I have never been here before, so in between my friend and the girl behind the counter, I was able to figure out what it was I wanted.  They have a ton of options, from meatless dishes, to stuff with chicken, pork, and even alcohol options to drink as well.   I went with a vegetable clear broth with chicken chunks, and my friend ordered a vegatarian thing since he doesn't eat meat.  They answered all my questions and gave me a lot of options to choose from.  Staff here is patient, and seems to not only know their menu, but take the time to answer questions to make sure your happy with what you order.  The food came out in a HUGE bowl.  It's like eating a hearty bowl of soup, with tons of good stuff in it.  I got through about half, and was STUFFED.  my friend ate about three quarters, and was stuffed as well.  We both have leftovers!  Total bill with drinks was about $20.  love it! I can eat a hearty meal, with left overs and not break the bank!  Will be back in the future, weather its just for dinner, or drinks as well.  Go here and try this place!
2 While the different soup bases are somewhat tasty, the ramen at the Republic as a whole did not impress. First it is not authentic at all in taste or ingredients. It seemed like they were serving us Pho, with uncooked pork thrown into this hot bath of broth left to cook. If serving pork, definitely should cook it first before throwing it into a bowl of broth to serve. It is not pork belly like most ramen places serve, its thinly cut pork with lots of fat on it. Not at all appealing to eat, very much to look at. Serving portions are large, but mainly just noodles. Vegetables that were added seemed like an after thought.   It is unfortunate that Republic missed the mark. With so few quality asian places in the Valley, was hoping for them to step up. If you have never had ramen it may be a nice change of pace for the taste buds. But if you ever had a decent bowl of ramen, then it is unlikely you will return.
4 Republic Ramen (or as I tend to say - Ramen Republic) is a great little place if you're looking for a huge serving of fantastic food for decently cheap. The staff is very friendly, and your food is prepared to exactly how you want. They've got a pretty great variety of soups and add ins, and lots of neat drinks too. I frequently come here with a large group of my friends, and they're always happy to serve us, which is a nice change of pace from restaurants that groan at large groups.  Overall, great little place with a fun, relaxed atmosphere. A definite visit is needed if you're in the area.
4 Awesome if you like ramen...even awesomer if you like boba tea!!!
3 I like Republic Ramen. It's a pretty good bwl of soup. I didn't say great, but it's pretty good. The noodles seem a little on the chewy side, but in general I enjoy it. Lot's of broth - not too much of the other ingredients.   The facility is pretty good - comfortable and not cramped.
4 Only ate here once; got the lightest ramen (chicken base?) with chicken cubes.  So tasty!  OK, so the noodles aren't homemade (hence the lack of 5th star) but was impressed with the takeout packaging.  The broth was kept separate from the noodles/veg/meat so I could combine them at home.  Huge portion, had enough for leftovers the next day.  The Bobo wasn't sweet enough for my liking, but I can ask for sugar next time.  I was also glad to find another Bobo joint.  I'm so going to be back!
3 First I will admit to not being a very impartial critic here-I absolutely adore a good bowl of ramen.  Although I've not been to Japan I've been fortunate enough to visit some outstanding ramen houses in Seattle, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Jose. While I think this is probably some of the better ramen I've had in Arizona, unfortunately that's not really saying much.  It was okay, not great. I ordered the miso ramen with chashu hoping against hope that I'd have a reasonable facsimilie to Santouka's spicy miso available in the Mitsuwa stores around the country-drool.....  The noodles were decent, though I wish there was more of them.  The broth was not very miso-y and lacked the depth that really makes the ramen bowl.  The chashu was really the weak point, sliced thin pork with no real discernable chashu quality.  The accompanying vegetables were fine although I wouldn't say it's what I'm used to/looking for. In short I'd say this is Americanized ramen-and no, not the cheap junk from the package but suited more for an American palate instead of leaning toward authenticity.  No fish cake or bamboo shoots, none of the cloudy unctuous broth, no pork belly chashu. The place looks great and the staff is great, I wouldn't dismiss it but Republic doesn't get a fervent recommendation either.
5 I knew this place had the best ramen in AZ, but yesterday I tried their curry with chicken. It's a killer! Great curry, big chunks of chicken all resting on a volcano of rice. Enough for 3 meals and the best I've had. Serving in a huge black stoneware bowl makes this scrumptious dish look like a volcanic island in a sea of mild Japanese curry.
2 Perhaps I expected too much of "real" ramen. Perhaps this place does not have said "real" ramen. Or perhaps I just got the wrong flavor, or I'm uncultured in the field of Japanese noodles. Maybe one of these reasons, but from what I tried, I am not a fan.  I either got Shoyu or Shio Ramen, traditional style.
2 "Meh. I've experience better." fits my rating of this place perfectly. I set my bar at instant noodles. Granted not all instant noodles are ramen, I put the bar there. I had high hopes for this place. I went with some friends and and was sadly disappointed. We ordered a variety of bowls and I had the chance to taste a few of the bowls. This place is very inconsistent from the reviews I read. Some people say they were bland but I found the soups to be too salty and the high dosage of MSG didn't help with my thirst. When I say high dosage, I'm sure the person who added the MSG doesn't realize that it causes thirst and can make a person's tongue numb. I was drinking cups of water for the rest of the night and couldn't get enough. The menu is pretty interesting as well. Not too many traditional items. The atmosphere was nice and clean and the service was polite and helpful.  Over all the restaurant is pleasant but the food is simply not that great. I had: - Tonkatsu Ramen - Shoyu Ramen - Sapporo Ramen.
3 Quick Note: If you are looking for a upscale "instant noodle", then this is the place. I should add the ramen served is not really instant noodle, but closely resembles one. If you are looking for a true ramen place, this is not it and if you are a purist-who-complains-a-LOT, stay away! I recommend it to most otherwise.  The Food: Fortunately, the range of additional toppings is pretty good, but every little bit adds up. The total for my order of Spicy Ramen +Egg +Chashu +Vege Paste +Garlic Paste +Chili Paste and a regular drink adds up to $17.27!!!  The soup is what resembles instant noodle the most. It taste like plenty of MSG in it, but is so delicious, I finished it anyways.   The Place: The place looks even more spacious due to it's open design. Definitely a hipster vs foodie place. There is a bar/restaurant combo on one side and a regular restaurant on the other side.  Da Service: This place is pretty much self-service except when they bring the food to you. You order it at the counter. They give you a placard on a holder with a number for delivery to table. Condiments and utensils are near the soda machine.  Ultimately:  Not too bad. Not excellent. A good place for students, which seems like the bulk of their customers anyways. Unless you are overly critical over ramen, add this place to the list of backup restaurants especially on a cold day (but this is AZland!).
1 NOT A FAN- FOOD WAS NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT.   you are better off making ramen at home and saving money..   the happy hour is they thing that made us stay and eat but even so, never again.
4 I'm not a ramen connoisseur or anything, so maybe I'm not the best person to judge the quality of what these guys are serving. What I can say though is that it's pretty darn good, the price is right, and the portions are huge. I'm also a big fan of the service here. If you're not picky and just want something good and different, it's definitely worth the trip.
4 Outside of Japan, this is some amazing ramen. The price isn't too bad either. The portions are huge. I can't ever finish an entire bowl. Also in the same building is a nice little tea and boba (spelling?) bar. It's all really yummy! You won't be dissapointed!
4 I visited Republic Ramen after getting a coupon at the Phoenix Comic Con. I was floored by the how many choices they offered in Ramen, most shops just have 3-4 options and absolutely nothing other than pork for the protein. I had the vegetarian Ramen with tofu and it was good- lots of delicious and fresh veggies- purple cabbage, chopped scallions, carrots, bean sprouts, and spinach. They have a tupperware of those wonderful red spices (I'm really not sure what they are but I love adding them to my Ramen) by the soda machine in the main dining area. Adding that to the Ramen you're able to control how much spice and how hot you want your noodles.  I am also very impressed by the beverage selection. They carry both Ashai and Ashai Black, a harder to find dark beer by Ashai, a Japanese brewery. Also they have OB a nice light Korean beer (technically a pale ale). I also sampled a boba tea for desert, their Taro is not the best I have had but it was still pretty darn good. All in all this was a solidly 4-star experience.
1 I would give less stars if I could. Came here several times and seemed okay, but in the last two trips I have found hair and a sharp piece of metal (I was told was from a cleaning bristle - yuck!) in my ramen. Totally grossed out and terrified of how much it would hurt to ingest metal like that. Never returning and advise that they are seriously looked into by the health department. Even more aggravating, the lady just said "sorry guys" to the last problem with our order - no refund. Horrible place.
3 In reality more like a 3.5 stars. I've been by this place many times and I was finally able to give it a go. Rather than ramble on about ambiance, the service, the location I'll cut right to what matters: the food. I'm a vegetarian and as such I accept that my dining options are not as vast as those with unrestricted diets. However, Asian cuisine is generally very veg friendly and as such I dine at Asian restaurants probably more than any other type of restaurant. Unfortunately, Republic Ramen falls a touch short of what I'd call "Veg Friendly". The only option you'll have is the Vegetarian Ramen, which is OK because that is what I came in there for. And while the ramen was good (very rich, salty and tons of toppings) one dining option is not enough to make me a regular. It would be nice to try, say some udon noodles or an appetizer that isn't edamame.  Again, the ramen is good. And the price is fair. But would it really be so bad to leave the fish sauce out of a dish or two? Or to try using a vegetarian dashi instead of a fish-based dashi?
4 Made the trek from Glendale to Tempe to try this place with friends after seeing the booth at Phoenix Comic Con. This just cemented my feeling that all of the cool and interesting restaurants are in the East Valley.  I ordered the tunkatsu ramen (sorry about the spelling) with beef and hubby ordered the spicy ramen with beef. I liked that there were lots of choices for broths and two different options for vegetables. The bowls of soup were HUGE- everyone ended up with enough left over for another meal. The broths were rich and salty, and definitely tasted like they had been simmered all day. The veggies were abundant and fresh and I felt like there were plenty of noodles although our friend disagreed. I would really have preferred that they cut up the pork in my soup- it was literally in large slices and was awkward to eat. Our friend had his soup with chicken and said it was diced, which makes much more sense.   Friends ordered the shrimp tempura and were pretty disappointed to find out that for $4 they got three pieces of shrimp and one onion ring, especially since the soups were so generous. They did say it tasted good, but that's still a pretty skimpy tempura for $4.  Prices were fair for the amount of food, at least for the soups. I wouldn't order the tempura again at that price. Part of me wants to say that since ramen is supposed to be cheap street food they could cut the price of everything by a dollar or so but then again, we all took home enough for another meal.  Oh, and although you order your food and pay at the counter, they bring it to you at your table and clear plates when you are finished. We tipped thinking that the restaurant wasn't full service and then felt bad afterwards. There is a cash tip jar at the counter if you make the same mistake though.
3 My husband and I saw this place about a year ago and wanted to try it but since we live in the North Valley its not often we are in the east valley together. We went with some friends and it was ..ok. It wasn't fantastic, the portions on soup were generous, but the Shrimp tempura was 3 pieces for 4.00. It was good though. Maybe I expected too much? For advertising that it was a real ramen place I expected to leave that think to myself I have to go back there!  Good service though. The girl behind the counter was knowledgeable, and the food came out fast and hot.  Certainly better then your pre-packaged 50cent Ramen you get from the store but I am not sure I would decide to spend my money here again when there are so many different places that are yummier.
3 We passed this place years ago and have been saying we've wanted to try it for so long but being so far away from us it has been difficult. But after getting a coupon at Phoenix Comic Con we bit the bullet and made the drive.  I have been wanting to try authentic Ramen for a very long time. And I will say the food was impressive, it tasted great, although I wish it were a little heavier on the noodles.   What I wasn't impressed with though was the price. A bowl of Ramen in Japan is like getting a hotdog from a street vendor in New York, it is supposed to be quick and inexpensive, and while I understand that it is a niche kind of dish here, I don't think $10+ for a bowl of soup and a drink is a very good value. We ordered an appetizer of Tempura shrimp too, $4 gets you three shrimp and a single onion ring. That actually kind of pissed me off.  The staff was friendly and the service was good and quick. I am happy for the experience, but I probably won't be back anytime soon unless I'm with someone that is really jonesing for some real-deal Ramen.
1 First, a public service announcement...  TONKOTSU = Pork bone. Broth that is used as a ramen soup base. TONKATSU = Pork cutlet (breaded in panko). Something you eat over rice.  Thank you. We now return to our regular opinionated review...     So you just saw Tanpopo or Ramen Girl and wanted to try some ramen from a place that specializes in ramen to see what all the fuss was really about. You come into this place, order a bowl of miso ramen and patiently await your meal. When the girl brings your ramen you close your eyes and imagine yourself in some quaint ramen shop somewhere in Japan - bullet train in the distance,  enka playing from the shop's speakers. You put the ramen broth to your lips and....  PPPPPPPPPPPFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!  almost spit it all back into the bowl. Instantly you're back in Tempe - light rail in the distance, alternative rock blasting from the speakers. The broth has not a molecule of miso flavor that your tongue can detect. Hell, Maruchan and Top Ramen have more flavor in their "flavor packets" than this sorry excuse for a broth.    Anyway, that's sorta what happened to me more or less. Came in  with rather high expectations and had them shattered the moment I tasted the broth. Umm... did I order the Shoyu Ramen by accident I wondered? If so, MISO SILLY! If I did, though, there should be  a stronger shoyu flavor. The noodles themselves tasted ok. There  were some slices of char siu and they were passable - meaning they  actually had a flavor that resembles char siu. But still, this   place wouldn't even cut it as a hospital cafe in a bad part of Tokyo. Reading some of the other reviews, however, I guess it can cut it  in a strip mall in Tempe on the south side of East University Drive.       I'd actually been here once before a while back and don't even remember what I ordered - it was that good. So I came back a second time just to make sure.  Fool Me Once, Shame On You. Fool Me Twice, MISO STUPID!    So I'm still hoping for a real ramen place to open up in the valley someday. Yeah, sure, some Japanese restaurants have ramen on their menu.  I mean an actual ramen shop that just serves ramen. Maybe yakisoba and  udon as well but primarily ramen. One can dream, right?
5 I can't get enough of this place. My boyfriend and I used to happily make the trek all the way from North Phoenix on a regular basis and have never been let down!  Whenever I go out to eat in Tempe, specifically close to ASU, I expect half-ass service. I expect there to be hungover waitresses and hostesses texting when I walk up because in the past that's what I've come across. Though there are college students working at Republic Ramen, they have always been extremely helpful and have given us fantastic customer service despite the fact sometimes there's only one cashier/server at a time (usually during work hours on weekdays).  What do I love most about the food at Repulic Ramen? The variety. There are several broth choices and they are happy to switch meat out for tofu. And the bowls are packed with tons of fresh veggies. I've seen a couple of complaints on here about the broth being bland - but I've never personally had that issue. Then again, I had a sh*t ton of Sriracha because it makes already phenomenal food taste THAT much better. Anyway, the bowls are huge. My boyfriend and I share one every time. And just in case we're hungrier than we thought, we always order a side of edamame or veggie tempura (if you go during happy hour it's like $1).  But my favorite FAVORITE part of RR is their boba. On the other side of the dining room is a little cafe where they serve boba, sake, coffee, etc. I've lived in North Phoenix and now I live near Central Phoenix and boba is pretty hard to come by in those parts. I'd have to drive to Chandler or the West Valley and that just won't ever happen. I almost always order thai tea milk tea w/ boba but sometimes venture out and get a peanut butter & chocolate snow (creamy slushy) and my boyfriend likes to mix fruity flavors - they have a lot of options and you can mix any of them. Their boba pearls are always soft and they are generous with the amount they put in. I don't know about you, but I hate when I eat all the boba before I'm finished with the liquid. In this case, sometimes I find myself just eating boba pearls because I've already drank all the tea.  All in all, this is probably my favorite restaurant. Does it feel like you're sitting down somewhere in Japan? No. It's definitely Tempe. It's very open and modern. But who cares because it's delicious. Fantastic food, friendly staff, clean bathrooms/tables/everything, lots of seating, and of course, boba!
4 Best hangover meal I can think of is a streaming bowl of spicy ramen from Republic.
2 I've been here once and thought it was so-so. I'm not sure how often I would be running back to eat here but I did leave with leftovers because this place gives you an ENORMOUS bowl of food! I also tried the thai boba tea, which I didn't love. If I'm in the area, I'd much rather check out four peaks (which is a block away) rather than this place, just sayin.
5 This 5 star rating is mostly for their boba! They are cool about how many flavors I put into my boba (usually about 4!) unlike other boba shops that only allow like 2  Their ramen is pretty good and decently priced. However, I don't like coming to this place much ONLY because I don't like coming out smelling like an Asian restaurant.
2 If you're trying to decide on a place for ramen, and you've ever dined at Ippudo, Naruto, Minca, or Totto in NYC and thought they had good to fantastic ramen, you will NOT like Republic.   I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with pork (you get a choice of meat) and an egg, and a lychee green tea with boba. The ramen was not complex at all, and really just tasted like salt. And the noodles looked and felt and tasted packaged, sooo not worth the calories tasty at all! The pork was tough and chewy and not tender at all, and there were so many fatty bits that were inedible that I wish I had opted for tofu. I liked the spinach, which was out of place but flavorful.  The bubble tea was AWFUL for the first few sips, which alternated between bitter and chemical-sweet, but after I let it sit for 15 minutes it was better. The boba were a little too hard/dry on the inside, but it was towards the end of the day so maybe they were just sitting around for a while? Considering how hard it is to find boba around this town, I'm not complaining-I would go back and try another flavor, but I wouldn't have high expectations.  Look, if you want soup with noodles, this place will do. But if you want RAMEN, with rich, complex broth that isn't overly salty, with tender pork and handmade noodles, I would skip this place. With enough hot sauce, it was definitely edible, but it wasn't what I was craving (since I was craving ramen)...and so I am disappointed.
1 Too bland no flavor. They need to work on there soup base, because thats what makes the ramen. Just too bland, and I ordered the miso ramen, which tasted like water and shoyu. First and last time coming here.
5 I love this place! They have Boba and Pho style noodle soup! It's low calorie, filling and tastes so good! The staff is all super friendly and it's very chic and modern. I used to live down the street and pop in when I was feeling hungry. Theres a tanning center and a tattoo shop right next door too! It's on University near McClintock and if you know that area it's pretty good. Over all, wonderful!
5 This place is hands down the best place I have been to in AZ for ramen. I used to go to Hawaii quite a bit and I loved the Ramen Houses there. I will definitely be back!
2 If you really want flavorless, salty broth with flavorless vegetables and meats, this is the place for you. For some reason, everyone I know and their mother loves this place. I honestly do not understand the appeal. If you have ever been to a place like Wagamama, you know there is a right way and a wrong way to do a noodle soup restaurant. This is the wrong way. First, every single soup I have ordered there (and I've been more than 3 times) tasted the same. I could not remember what I had the times before I went, they were that unmemorable. The misconception that this place is healthy also is kind humorous to me. I'm sure I'm getting my weekly value of sodium every time I go there.   I do have to mention, however, how great their squid salad, kimchee, and other small plates are. Whether they are from a jar or pre-prepared is another story, but regardless, they are good. The boba tea seems to be the thing to get here if you're not into ramen or just passing through. I'm not a connoisseur of boba teas so I will not pretend I know what I'm talking about with that, albeit I'm sure it's good.
2 PROS: Cashier was helpful and friendly, service was good, decent boba selection. CONS: Place is dirty, both ramen & udon taste packaged with some fresh green onions and spinach thrown in for color, green tea tasted like potpourri.    Will be on the lookout for a more authentic ramen house with better tasting soup for your money.
3 Not too pricey way to get a huge meal. I had the tonkotsu noodles and it was a little too salty, but otherwise, the meat was generous and the toppings fresh. One bowl could have easily fed two people, so I definitely had some leftovers!
3 This is a fun place.  It is a great place for a fast, cheap meal.  Is it truly authentic?  It is probably closer to being authentic to many places around the country. Wagamama-like?  Perhaps.  If you know how to order you will do okay here.  A great addition to restaurants in Tempe!
4 Man, if you live on campus and havent been to this place yet you are missing out. Very reasonable prices, especially considering how much you get for them.  I oredered the Shoyu ramen (traditional) for takeout. The actual restaurant looks very modern. Very clean, large, good for groups. The service was fast, and the staff was great. I got my food and was on my way. Unfortunately, there was some kind of leak in the container that my broth was in so it leaked all over my seat in my car. And when I got home and picked up the bag, the entire bottom fell out and there went my broth- everywhere. I was so sad! Until I took a chance and called Republic. I explained to them what happened and they had more broth ready for me when I got there, free of charge. So awesome.  As for the actual food, I wasnt so much a fan of the traditional ingredients. The broth and actual ramen were very good though.  Ill definitly be back, but Ill be ordering the "Original" ingredients.
4 This place has improved tremendously, the quality and flavor is much better than it had been, it tastes like when they first opened. The menu had also been expanded. For anyone who hasn't been I recommend you give it a try and anyone who had been put off by a prior visit, I suggest you give Republic another chance.. Maybe try something different this time. The tonkotsu was great with te addition of corn and an egg, and the Sopporo was pretty good too. To even out the review I will say I'm not sure why they decided they needed to shower the kimchi with scallions or why the seaweed salad was so sweet, not in a bad way, just different. they need to perfect their noodles a bit, but it won't stop me from coming back.  :)
2 The first time I went, they were horribly understaffed. No spoons, dirty tables all over the place, took at least 10+ minutes for the order, the experience was a mess. If I hadn't come back, it'd be a one-star easy.  Gave it another shot as it was the only place open at the time. Tried the miso ramen this time, but if it wasn't for the miso floating in the soup, I'd think it was normal shoyu broth. They did try to be creative with different veggies, but the baby spinach is not a great idea as it broke down quickly in the hot broth, which was still hot after a while, so a plus there. Maybe I've been spoiled by other ramen shops on the west coast, but I find this place forgettable. Well, the only thing I won't forget is not wanting to come back.
4 I give it four stars just cause I can't find any other place in the valley that specializes in ramen. I think it's worth the money, I'm usually filled to the brim by the time I'm done eating. Most ramen can be customized, you can choose what meat to add, you can also add fishcake, eggs, and extra vegetables. The basic ramen is loaded with vegetables anyway, so you don't have to drink a V8 later.   The atmosphere is a little awkward though, the usual music being played is pretty obnoxious. Otherwise a fine establishment, nice staff, clean floors, tables, utensils, etc.
5 Great, fast service and a nice clean atmosphere for some pretty cheap prices. I generally get their (fancy and tasty!) iced tea and add the garlic and soy-soaked egg to my soups, which makes things closer to 10 bucks a head.  Not all of the broths are for everyone; I like the tonkatsu broth the most and don't really get the chili-oriented broths, but my wife's reasonably fond of those. The sapporo corn broth is really fun. There are lots of condiments for the soup: the togarashi chili powder's generally enough for me, but if you'd like your soup saltier/sesame-er, go for it.  The curry rice is surprisingly excellent, too! It's really hard to justify gettin' that when you're at a ramen house, though.  There's better ramen in the valley, but not with this price or the fun amount of options. The veggies are unique and fresh, and everyone's super friendly. It's a great place to warm your bones when it's cold or rainy outside.  Pro tip: eat most of the spinach before it cooks in your soup if you don't want it to alter your noodles' flavor.
3 For Asian that's a place for American, cause the menu is design for them.... But the food still taste good n the place is clean. If u r looking for American style Asian food try here!
4 It was a great bowl of noodles, and huge, too (the Republic Bowl or whatever it was called).  Odd that they cut the chicken into tiny cubes... try that with chopsticks!  But the meat was tender and the broth quite flavorful, and loaded with vegetables.  As some reviewers say, 'eh' -- this is not Tokyo, this is Tempe, Arizona.  Pleasant place to hang out although why does every place seem to think they need to suffuse every spare moment with soft rock music?  Good place to bring a group of friends for lunch, or sit by yourself and have a good nutritious feed.
4 Ramen was tasty and the sake flight (4 sake) was inexpensive. However, theAlmond Milk Tea with boba was horrid.
2 Let me just start by saying this place is really affordable, but unfortunately you really get what you pay for. The noodles are okay but all of the food including the udon and ramen are way too salty. The decor makes a nice attempt at being a hip modern spot but their fans are covered in dust and the seating is extremely uncomfortable. I was stoked when I saw the prices, but overall my experience was not great. I wouldn't return for the food or the ambiance.
5 I had to eat here at least once, and would eat here more often if it were in a more convenient location for me.  Have you ever wanted to try real ramen?  News flash -- the 99 cent packages of "ramen" at the grocery store is just about one of the worst things you can stick into you body and can hardly be called food at all.  If you feel insulted by this sentence, then I would not recommend Republic Ramen + Noodles, but if you were intrigued by my question, look up the address immediately.  Besides, and I haven't done extensive research on this, but I believe that instant ramen in Japan comes with the broth, which leads me to believe that they don't even have what we call "ramen" in Japan.  For those who are neither insulted nor intrigued, just keep in mind that you are ordering soup for your meal.  If that won't fill you up, consider an appetizer.  There are a variety of styles and ingredients that you must select from.  Naturally, I ordered naruto with my ramen.  The reason for this will be left unpublished.  All that is missing is counter side dining with privacy drapes.
2 After reading the reviews, I should have known better than to expect good ramen but I was still hopeful.  Sadly, I was disappointed.  I ordered the tonkotsu pork belly with an egg traditional style, as well as edamame and gyozas to share.  The appetizers were cooked well and the best part of the meal.  When the huge bowls were ready, I realized that they gave me the modern version of ramen instead of what I ordered.  The sulky girl behind the counter who took my order originally was not what I wanted to deal with again so I went with it.  There was no depth to the broth and the noodles were not ramen noodles as they were soft and kind of slimy.  The store bought packaged kind is better.  Where was the milky broth made rich and unctuous by hours upon hours of slowly simmered pork bones?  This was a poor introduction to ramen for my friend who never had it before.  I couldn't even eat half of it because it was not good and bland.  When we went to get to go containers since I hate to waste food, the same unhelpful girl asked why we needed two...really?
2 The ramen here is absolutely horrible. I still come here because of 2 things. My friends like it here and it's really the only ramen place in the Tempe.  Bottom line, this place is for people that had never experienced excellent ramen other than the package ramen at the store. This place just puts a lot of sodium in your broth and then gives you hot sauce too to cover up the bland taste.   I have eaten ramen in Japan and California, and this place can't compare. But if YOU have never eaten authentic ramen bowls in Asia or California, then YOU may like this ramen. Oh... this place isn't even run by anyone that is Japanese. Contrary to what their shirts say, THEY DON"T KNOW RAMEN.  And the prices at actually kind of high for it's mediocre quality. If you are in AZ and want some authentic ramen, try Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe. They are not a ramen restaurant but they do serve a couple of different ramen bowls. You'll notice the drastic difference.
3 It's OKAY. The ramen noodles are the right blend of chewy and slurpee, but the broth and toppings leave much to be desired. The char siu is bland and fatty, the garlic seems like it came out of a jar, the naruto is too thin and flavorless, and the broth tastes like hot soy sauce water. Seriously, hot water with lots of soy sauce. The people who work here are nice enough but they always look like they'd rather be shaving with rusty disposable razors. The food came out way too slow and I felt the prices were too high for being what it is - peasant noodle soups. With that said, they have boba milk tea (YAY!) with chewy yum boba, and a great array of flavors. The got mega bonus points just for having kimchee. I'll probably be back, mostly because California is too far to travel for one bowl of Santouka. It's not terrible; I've just had better.
5 I love this place!! Every time I come back to Arizona I try to make sure and eat here at least once! Great ramen, the coconut boba is to die for and I love that you can go with traditional or more American style toppings on your ramen. Mmm I want it right now!
2 It's a weird thing:  The food here isn't good and since it's a ramen place, you get soooo much of it.  I hate wasting food, so I eat it all, and I'm forcing myself to eat this shit that's super bland and I'm like, "Man.... this sucks."  And it's hot so I'm sweating from that and just shoveling food I don't particularly enjoy into my mouth--not that it's gross, but because someone served it and went, "Shit!  I forgot to add anything to it to make it taste like stuff!  Oh, well.... too late now."
4 This is a neat little place really close to the ASU Tempe Campus. They have several types of modern style ramen. For those who are confused, this is not a place where they serve you instant ramen! This is homemade ramen noodles, good broths, and vegetables, meats, or eggs etc.  That being said, this place offers a variety of ramen broths as well as other dishes such as Japanese cury and udon. They also offer several appetizers you can find at many other places like gyoza and edamame. As a plus, this place also serves good quality boba and several different Japanese beers and sakes!  If you are from Japan, this is not the greatest ramen you will ever eat, more an American twist on Japanese ramen. But, for being so close to campus and being so reasonably priced, it's not bad. I find this is more of a comfort food kind of place.  The environment is casual, definitely geared towards the college students. There are some TVs that usually showcase some sporting event, and the music is upbeat. I go here with my friends all the time and the wait time to receive your food is pretty short, I would estimate ten minutes or less. Overall, I recommend it, it's pretty cheap, about $7 or $8, and I come back often.
3 I was surprised to find that this is a rather trendy and expensive ramen shop, rather than your classic hole in the wall ramen soup joint. There was a huge line and wait while we were there. The meals are ordered and paid for at the register and then a staff member will bring it to your table afterwards. Unfortunately, while this place is pretty and pricey, the cheap hole in the wall ramen that I've had was much better. The food here was pretty good, but between the line, wait, and price, I don't think I'll be coming back.
3 I've always been a fan of this place because it's just about the only place to get ramen in the valley, and their ramen is pretty tasty. But the last time I went there I ordered my standard republic broth with tofu, add hard boiled egg, and extra noodle, but also got a side of food poisoning. I know it was this place because other than here I had only had a small breakfast of toast and laughing cow cheese at home (which I eat every morning) that day. The following morning I woke up with all the symptoms of food poisoning, I still give them 3 stars because I have been eating here for years. I don't know what changed but I won't be going back anytime soon.
2 anything but ramen...
4 Get extra bowls or a to-go container you wil need them.   HUGE portions which scores points for me always. The food is great too. No, it's not authentic, but if you're just looking for some feel-good food come here. Portions are huge which is why it costs a bit (up to nine bucks after tax) but their best item is actuallt their cheapest the plain udon at under seven bucks after tax.   Their udon noodles are super thick you won't miss the meat. I have very Americanized tase buds I'll admit, but to me the broth is super tasty. I put in a cup of chili oil and it's bliss in a bowl.   Also gets points for atmosphere very clean, for just a few dollarsmore than fast food it's actually a place you can enjoy sitting in and spending time.
3 Dear reviewers reading, This place is too cute. Very trendy and laid back like as if you stepped into Scott Pilgrim movie very hipster. Sells a limit number of ramen noodles and soups, along with boba teas. With the price they charge you get a ton of anything, never a small portion, I was worried that I was going to get something little or not worth it but was I wrong. The bowls are HUGE HUGE HUGE and comes with a lot. Very delicious and fills one up easy. Really good service they always check on the people to make sure everything is going good in fact my friend accidentally raised her hand barely up and someone came running over to see if she needed anything.   Down sides would be a tad bit pricey but you get a ton, limited seating if it's a full house it might go bad, little selection of boba teas.
2 I was passing by Tempe, AZ on my way back to California, and I was in the mood for some Ramen.  I searched in Yelp and the only one I could find is this place.  The place look clean and high tech, it looks impressive.  However, you can't judge a book by its cover.  I don't why they call their soup ramen apart from the noodle that they used.  It's so bland; well, if they were honest they should just call it noodles, and vegetables with soy sauce, but definitely don't call it Ramen because it is not.  If you ever tasted Ramen from Asia or if you visited Southern California, and had some Ramen, I would highly recommend that you stay away from this place.
5 Excellent hangout, feel like an ASU student again. Very authentic Japanese foods and the bobas and second to none!
3 Average ramen but is already enough for a near school ramen restaurant. The spicy oil and power are very good. I prefer the traditional style
5 Their Ramen was delicious!! An awesome thing for a rainy day!
4 They are a bit pricey but i really like the location and interior. They have good food and very friendly staff. I don't frequent too often but it's worth going to.
5 Wow!  So good.  I came here with Sarah A (aka Dr Sarah) to give it a try before it got too hot out eat soup and I loved it.  I got a simple traditional ramen bowl with tofu and ate up every last drop.  I understand its not authentic ramen but that's fine by me because it still tastes great.  After all, Taco Bell isn't authentic Mexican food and I like them too.    I'm looking forward to fall just so I can come here and enjoy some more ramen.
2 Republic Ramen looks and sounds like a promising restaurant; unfortunately, my first bite told me otherwise.  While the food is not inedible, it definitely does NOT resemble traditional Japanese ramen.  I ordered an original milk tea boba & a bowl of tonkotsu ramen with pork.  The pork is nothing like the pork that comes with authentic ramen.  Instead, it was pale, tough, and flavorless.  The noodles and soup are fine but way less flavorful than I am used to from a restaurant advertising themselves as a ramen restaurant and not just a plain noodle house.  And the boba I ordered was VERY flavorless and watered down.  However, on the bright side, the boba pearls were the perfect texture and level of chewiness!
3 Perhaps I'm being harsh on literally the only ramen joint for maybe tens of miles, but this place is alright. The ramen is decent given the price. Given the taste, it's good but it's not great.  The tonkotsu broth has the characteristic richness and savory flavors, but it tasted a bit watery to me. The pork was excellent but the cuts were somewhat lean, missing the rich fattiness I had come to associate with meat in ramen. The veggies were solid and the noodles, most likely store bought, worked well in the dish. I'm a big fan of egg so I got the extra add on, but unfortunately it was cold and hard boiled, not sure if I would do it again.  If you're craving some Asian soup and want a change of pace from pho, Republic Ramen is good for that. It's a decent joint, but since I'm from an area saturated with ramen joints, I'm not sure if I'd come here alone. Would definitely recommend for parties trying something new.
4 I'll admit it, I don't know much about the kind of Ramen that doesn't come in a small dehydrated square with a silver seasoning packet, but I really, really liked my food here!   The price seems a smidge high for what you are ordering, but we did get a crap-load of food for our money!  I ordered the traditional pork ramen and my husband got the spicier version with tofu and we both really liked our food.  Our daughter snacked on a bowl of soybeans and a strawberry icee boba drink and the occasional noodle she swiped from our bowls.    The place is cute with a slight hipster, college kids vibe, which means my husband and I were wildly out of place with our messy haired toddler and our frazzled thirty-something parent look.     (Okay, okay...forty-something.  You caught me.)  And being a crotchety old fart, I will also mention the only thing my husband and I didn't care for was the music blaring overhead, but that's okay since I don't suspect we are their primary demographic target, and our 1970's punk music probably won't go over too well with the hipster college set...amiright?  ;-)
4 One of my favorite restaurants in Tempe.  I have tried a couple of the ramens, but the Republic and chili pepper are my go-to favorites.  I usually order the ramen with traditional toppings, but both selections of toppings are great.  I also enjoy the good selection of bobas.  The prices are also pretty reasonable and if you are looking for ramen this is the place to try.
3 it makes me sad that pho is such a huge deal in az while there's barely any ramen shops at all. don't get me wrong-pho is awesome, but i LOVE ramen. so what's the deal, arizona? let's get some more ramen shops going!   so that brings me to republic. if you've had ramen in japan and constantly crave it like i do, don't come here expecting any of that deliciousness-you will be sorely disappointed.  republic's ramen is totally mediocre, yet i keep coming back because it's the closest thing that i can get.  sad.   it doesn't really matter what you order, all of the soups taste practically identical so i'd recommend going with the chili pepper ramen-it at least gives the super bland broth some zip.   other than that, the place is cute, the employees are friendly, and they do have a good selection of drinks/boba.
1 Yeah... No! This place is seriously horrible. The whole set up is strange and the ramen is even stranger. I would rate this as the worst ramen shop I've ever been to. I've had ramen all over California and Japan... Why even call it ramen...
2 Truly, I've experienced better.  As other Yelpers have noted, I am sure this place has improved quite a bit since it first opened. What I found most off-putting from my first couple of visits, though, was the service! I sincerely value good service, and good service wasn't what my friends and I received at Republic Ramen.  To play devil's advocate, I usually do go to Republic Ramen with rather large groups of friends. I can see how this can get to be overwhelming, with 15+ hungry adults placing orders and demanding food right away. I just felt like some of the staff could have been nicer/less rude/more attentive?  The food was also...okay. I didn't think they were particularly memorable dishes in any way. Same goes for the boba tea shop next door (which is part of the same restaurant, I believe).  I might give Republic Ramen another shot--this is one of the closer ramen shops in my area, so I definitely want to give it anther go. I do hope the experience is more enjoyable this time around.
4 I absolutely love the food here. I've never tasted anything I don't 100% love. The Tokyo ramen with beef is my go to, but the Shoyu and Tonkotsu ramens are delicious as well. The location is great, and the hours aren't bad. I do kind of wish they were open a bit later, I think they'd do well with all the college kids in town!  My only downside to this place is the service. For the most part, you encounter rude, blank staring college kids who are counting down the minutes until their shifts are over. I've never had the pleasure of being greeted by someone friendly! I return for the food, but the service needs a serious improvement.
4 Great 1st time experience! Got the tempura shrimp soba noodle (added zucchini) w/ a side of kimchi. Delicious. Fast. Clean atmosphere. We'll def be back for more
3 Place was clean and had a modern look. Ordered the tonkatsu ramen with pork.  The ramen came in a large bowl with all the fixins (bean sprouts, green onions, carrots, and spinach) which I really did not care for. The broth was flavorful, the pork was tasty and plentiful, and the noodles were very good. Overall, very satisfied as I was craving ramen.  I would definitely come back.
2 About the only thing I can say about it is it's ramen. Got the chili pepper ramer, which adds a glop of Thai chili paste to their soy based broth. The chicken was quite bland, and diced very small which made picking up pieces with the chopsticks quite impossible. The result leaves you with spoonfuls of bland chicken in the end, not the best ending at all to a meh meal. I suppose peddling this to college students, who haven't developed keen taste buds yet but have the disposable cash to not have to suffice on a traditional student based ramen diet, this place works. The staff was friendly and the meals were delivered quickly, even for a well packed house and close to closing time.
3 I was seriously craving ramen so I found this place on Yelp and drove here after school. (Why aren't there any ramen places here?) I ordered the Republic Ramen and the food came out pretty quickly. It was around $8-9. The place is cute, it was clean and bigger than I expected.  As soon as I tasted the broth, only one word popped up in my mind: bland. So I got up and got a bunch of sriracha, chili oil, and the chili pepper and poured them in, as I have done before with bland ramen.   It wasn't as bad as some that I have tried, but definitely not as good as ramen you'd get in LA. I liked the spinach (I love spinach), but I wish they put more sprouts. The beef was not that great, it was kind of tough. The soup needed way more flavor and waay more spiciness. I got the Republic Ramen cause I thought it'd be kind of spicy (it says it has spicy exotic peppers in the description). The bowl was huge though and I couldn't finish it by myself, next time I'll make sure to share with a friend. Because I was starving and ramen was the only thing I was going to eat that day, I ate quite a bit of it. But if it was a normal day and I was in a normal mood, I honestly probably would have boxed it and given it to my brother or something lol.  I've honestly made better ramen at home (not the typical stuff in a bag, but decent ramen). Thankfully it's fall break and I can run to LA to get my ramen fix.
4 I didn't think I would like this place, because I had the idea in my head that paying for ramen at a restaurant was a waste of money. I mean, you can buy a packet of ramen for $0.25 and make it yourself at home and add your own fixings!  BUT I was wrong. it was totally worth it to pay for the ramen here. I loved their "traditional" toppings choice, very different than other noodle soups I've tried.  and they give you a LOT of food in one bowl - could easily take home  half for leftovers.  plus, the boba is good and tastes like it was made fresh that day, not hard and old like at some other places.  I'd come here again!
2 I'm not being harsh but this is not real ramen. The soup looks boring. Ajisen Ramen is average in California but if compares to this place, it would become gourmet ramen. ASU students could use this place for late night dinner instead of fast food or instant noodles though.
4 I've always enjoyed coming here because ramen is sooooo good It is not the .10 cent bags you can make on your own...  I must say that these are huge bowls and I recommend one bowl to two people. They are huge! My favorite is the Tonkotsu Ramen which is a pork flavored broth and I add pork meat. Ramen would be the perfect "sickness" meal or the perfect "hangover" meal. I love that they have chili powder and Sriracha that you can add into your bowl. I must say that I do not like the small water cups though, they are tiny. Other than that everything is wonderful and I hope you enjoy your bowl of ramen :)
3 this place isn't amazing but you get a huge bowl of ramen and it's decent. I got the republic ramen and it was kinda bland and loaded with green onions and spinach. I had to flavor my broth using the chili oil and spices. My boyfriend got the chili pepper ramen and his broth was pretty flavorful already and then adding the spices and chili oil just made it better. their boba was decent and we would probably come back but I would think pho would be my first pick before this.
5 I was craving for ramen before we fly back to Los Angeles. My husband found Republic Ramen through Yelp. I ordered the Republic Ramen with traditional toppings and tofu, my husband ordered the Tokyo Ramen with original toppings and beef. It was very good!!! Generous portions for the price and in big soup bowls. We come to AZ for fun and business several times a year so Republic is on our "must eat" list.
4 On the East side of ASU's sprawling csmpus, Republic Ramen + Noodles is the perfect spot to cure your Mill Ave. hang over. Or stop by any time for a taste of authentic ramen bowls.  Definitely a favorite of mine to bring out of towners to. They think they are headed to an authentic taco shack and end up in a trendy little ramen spot.
5 Love the miso ramen. Get the traditional toppings though. This place is pretty legit.
1 Another ramen joint trying to capitalize on the uber popular ramen craze. This place screams, "We're in the business to make money, not food!" The interior looks like a cobbled up mess, at least the boba serving side did. Speaking of which, why is this place attached to a boba store?   The ramen here is mediocre at best. I have had much better ramen both in the East Coast (Ippudo, Totto, etc.) and the West Coast (Daikokuya, etc.) within the same price range. The tonkotsu ramen, which apparently is there best seller, did not have any depth in the broth. The noodles were bloated/somewhat soggy and there additional sides were just awful (ex. What should have been menma (fermented bamboo shoots) was just plain hard bamboo cut up). Lets not forget the char siu, which I guess to them is non-roasted thinly sliced pork similarly used in Korean bbq.   In summary, yes this place is better than your $.10-$.25 bag of ramen, but $7-$8? I don't think so. I only came here since I frequent AZ for business and it was a chilly day which in turn made me crave something soupy. As a Japanese American, I searched for the perfect Japanese comfort food to fulfill my soup craving. Unfortunately, all I found was a mediocre noodle joint which falsely represented the traditional Japanese noodle soup dish.
2 We went with high expectations, but were disappointed in the flavor of the vegetarian bowl. The meal was presented nicely and the food looked fresh, but the broth had zero flavor even with the added garlic paste. The noodles were cooked properly as well, but flavor is critical.
4 I came here once before to grab a bowl of warm ramen for a sick friend, and only had their thai milk tea boba (which is really great). I came back last night with a group of friends and had their vegetarian broth ramen with zucchini and a boiled egg. For a (HUGE) bowl of ramen and a boba tea, the total was only $12. I had plenty of leftovers for today. Their broth selection is expansive (even if they only have one vegetarian option) and their add-on's aren't pricey. I'm no ramen expert, and just recently was introduced to it. I've tried ramen at one other local restaurant and I have to say that Republic Ramen is pretty great for the price.
2 I had to update this review and the reason I lowered the rating of it isn't due to the food, quality of food or anything like that. They lose 2 stars on the simple fact that for the past 5 times I've been there they f*** my order up. And what the f*** up isn't even a huge deal so I just can't wrap my head around why it keeps happening.   I always order the Sapporo ramen. It's SUPPOSED TO come with butter and corn in it already. And then I just add all the extras to it. It's there, on the menu, clear as day that the Sapporo ramen SPECIFICALLY comes with butter and corn. So when I place my order I ask for the Sapporo ramen, add egg and naruto. EACH AND EVERY time I get my order and all the extras I asked for are in there...but no butter or corn. Who the hell is working back there in the kitchen to get it wrong EVERY...SINGLE...TIME?!?! Not every now and again...but EVERY SINGLE TIME...  I can bet you $50 right now...that I'll walk in there, order it...and it will be wrong. I can 1000% guarantee it will be wrong.  I know what a lot of people are saying..."What's the big deal? Just ask for butter and corn..." Which, yeah sure...I would (actually I have to anyway since they won't give it to me to begin with)... But why should I HAVE to ask for something to be added to a soup that THEY put on the menu saying should already be in there?!?!? What ever happened to quality control??? Or can I safely assume that no one just gives a f***?  Here's an idea...just take it off the menu. You can't seem to get it right away...so save me the trouble of having to get angry about it later and just remove it off the menu.
4 Order at the counter, and they bring it to you.  Service is pretty fast.  They also sell a selection of Hawaiian and Japanese beers.  We really like the food here.  I recommend the Curry Rice, ask for a little extra curry.  Edamame is a great appetizer here.  The ramen also tends to be pretty good too.  There are always some seats available, and they have some patio seating too if the weather is nice.    Great for a quick lunch or dinner!
2 Coming in from out of state and I was craving good ol' tonkotsu ramen.  Found this place on yelp.  I am going to try to be as constructive as possible.  So here goes it: I ordered a tonkotsu ramen and it did not hit the spot. Their broth needs flavor other than just salty. Where was the pork flavor?  The charsui pork needs to be simmered more to make it tender. Perhaps they can use some mushrooms, non-intrusive veggies and aromatics to wake up the flavor to make it a true charsui. Also work on a finishing sauce to add to the bowls of ramen shortly before serving. There's a good market out there for them.  I hope they can significantly improve on their products. Republic - that word sets high expectations.
4 Tried this place for the first time last night and it was Really good! Of course not as good as you get in Japan or like even Ippudo in NYC but it is the best I have found in AZ and defiantly fulfilled my ramen craving! Not sure why they got so many bad reviews? Maybe they have improved since first opening? Anyways I had the tonkatsu with traditional toppings and an egg. Pros- rich yummy porky broth, perfectly chewy noodles, bomb bamboo shoots and naruto! ( the little swirls make me so happy ) cons- pork could be more tender and the egg was NOT a proper ramen egg. It should have a soft medium yolk not a dry crumbly yolk. Overall though I was so happy with my big bowl of ramen! Very delicious! Costumer service was fine not wow but not bad. We will defiantly be going back!
2 When the weather here in AZ dipped, I thought something warm would be nice. Naturally ramen sounded like it would do the trick, so i gave this place a chance.   I ordered the Sapporo Ramen (Sweet Butter corn in miso flavored broth) with original toppings & beef. The veggies were all good except for the carrots which were past their prime. While the soup was warm and flavor was so so, i just wasn't blown away by anything. The staff was not very pleasant and seemed annoyed by all my questions with their menu.   This place is just okay, nothing really special or unique about it.
4 Oh hello, delicious!    Craving a big ol' bowl of yummy ramen? Look no further than Republic Ramen + Noodles.   Dude and I really enjoyed this place. Judging by the outside, you wouldn't expect to find this Tempe gem.   You walk in, and order at the counter and someone brings your ramen out to you. Both fountain and alcoholic beverages available, and know there's a Boba shop in here as well.   Clean, comfortable, open atmosphere with minimalist design with wooden benches and tables.   I had the Chili Ramen with Beef, Traditional Toppings, 8/10 spiciness, and Dude had the Republic Ramen with Beef, also with Traditional Toppings.   These bowls are HUGE and we could have easily shared one, but hey, lunch leftovers for work the next day.   Plenty of kick from that spice, and the beef was not fatty at all. Thinly sliced and tender. The noodles were just right, not overcooked.   I'm no ramen expert, but damn, this was yummy.   So mad we overlooked this joint for so long. Will definitely be back, and dragging my ASU brother along for a nice free meal on the big sis!
4 This place is great for your ramen fix.  Nothing spectacular but the taste is right.  I recommend the fatty pork ramen, aka tonkatsu ramen.  The miso and Sapporo ramen were a bit saltier.
4 When I want a big bowl of comfort food and am in the east valley this is one of our favorites. The soups are great. And I don't have to do any work (I'm the cook in our house). Sometimes I just want a hearty bowl of pho or another Asian soup. And this place can kill that craving. And the prices are high but the portions are huge. I do think that some of the side dishes are a bit expensive for the portion size but the soups are great.
4 The best bowl of Ramen I've come across in the valley. I had Republic Ramen with Spam. I know, I know; Spam isn't exactly haute cuisine, but any restaurant willing to take a chance on it has earned my interest. I was not disappointed! It was excellent with Sriracha and their blended mix of peppery spices. I'd love to take some of the spice mix home to use in the kitchen! Top it off with the best Thai boba tea I've ever had, and you have a great late lunch/early dinner that leaves you wanting more. Can't wait to come back.
3 After hearing my friends talk about this place all the time I finally decided to give it a try a couple night ago, bad idea because it was pretty crowded! I checked the menu online and was unsure if I would even like it (Only ever had .10 ramen) I don't ever leave reviews but I was slightly surprised this place didn't have more positive feedback. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen which the cashier recommended it was pretty good  but the noodles were slightly overlooked. Loved the portions size tho! I do think they should put less broth, the noodle to broth ratio is off. Like the other reviewer wrote, I too thought it was weird there was a tip option for the workers BUT while waiting for my food I realized just how much the cashier does! They were all over the place doing so many things it was hard to even get a container for the rest of my ramen. I probably noticed all this since I've mostly worked in restaurants most my life and know how hectic it can be. Anyways, pretty good ramen! Will definitely be back again.
4 The girl and I first came here when we are feeling a case of the sniffles and were wanting to nip it in the bud without cooking a hot soup ourselves. we came here again a few weeks ago with a friend because we enjoyed it so much.  The restaurant has a really nice atmosphere with tables for parties of any size. The food itself comes in huge portions so come hungry or share it with someone. First time I got Republic Ramen with beef and traditional toppings. Word of warning if you're not a fan of seaweed ask them to remove it or stick to original toppings. Had a good spice to it and the toppings went very well with it. Seaweed was a bit strong but that's to be expected. Downside to the traditional toppings is that if you do have seaweed with it and end up taking any home, the seaweed tends to overpower the soup to the point I couldn't eat it. So take a lesson from me and share the traditional style one in house with someone.  The second time I came here I got the Republic Ramen with chicken and original toppings. The original toppings has a lot of tasty veggies and no seaweed so would have been fine to take home if I hadn't finished it off. Only disappointment was the cubes of chicken that was in it does not absorb any of the broth and doesn't appear to have been preseasoned so the chicken itself was a little bland. Otherwise it was a great combo as well. Would just recommend sticking with beef.  The bottom line: Great food, great prices, and great atmosphere. So next time you want some great soup or are a little under the weather and want a quick fix, definitely give Republic Ramen a try.
2 I wonder if they use ocean water as broth or salt is on sale. I ordered the miso ramen and the broth was so awfully salty that I couldn't finish. I added 2 pack of sugars and a cup of water but didn't help. They do give a large portion and their beef is pretty decent. Their honeydew boba is good too and the reason I give 2 stars.
1 Not with it
3 Delicious soup with lots of options at a great price, in a cute little shop.    Super nice service - they split our soup into two bowls (the portions are huge, and we were going somewhere afterwards so we couldn't take home leftovers).    My husband and I split a bowl of the vegetarian soup with additional corn (a really good add), and it was yummy, especially with some soy sauce and spice from their fixins area (they also have sesame oil, yum!).  We also had a little portion of edamame ($1 at Happy Hour).
3 Eh. The food is kind of bland and the staff wasn't very attentive. The only good thing there is boba tea which is probably the only reason I'll go back.
3 The ramen isn't amazing by any means, but it's pretty decent. Good fix to satisfy your ramen cravings!
3 Secretly I have been wanting to try Republic Ramen for many months, but the fact that I am not a soup person keep me from it, but after a little adventure with Ramen not too long ago, it left me craving for some more! So I thought what a perfect time to try Republic Ramen & Noodles, and I made my way there.  It was around 4:45 on a cool wed evening the place wasn't too busy, what I didn't realize was this was sort of a fast food type of place, as soon as you walk in you see the menu to order off of. After checking it out, I went with Chili Pepper Ramen, soy sauce based infused with Thai Chili pepper, bell pepper & roasted garlic and it comes with spinach, sprouts, scallions, carrots & your choice of pork, tofu, spam, chicken or beef. I went with beef, I placed my order then took my seat to wait for it! You can add other items to your ramen at a low price, but since this was my 1st time I just went with the items already included   The soup came out, and I have to say it smelt soo good, and the flavor of the broth was good, but not spicy enough for me, but I added some sriracha and we were in business! I like that they use locally grown veggies and you can tell they are fresh, the spinach was perfect! Next time I will add more veggies to my ramen. The only thing that I didn't care for in the ramen was the beef itself, it was a thick slices of beef that was tough, like a tough roast, I didn't care for it, maybe next time I will just skip adding any type of meat at all, if I go back but it's a big bowl of ramen, and the broth was delish
5 Love the soup here, when I have a craving for Ramen I always come to this place and the boba tea is soooo good!
3 I have heard many great things about this place and of course, I went to tempe just to try it. The place itself is very nice and very close to ASU. However, I was very disappointed. I ordered the republic ramen- traditional topping and oh boy! It was not as good as I expected! The ramen size was excellent; however, the taste, the flavor was okay- I would say passable. Simply disappointing.   I was also excited to try their boba drink and let me tell you, it was one of the worst I have tasted! I have tried many, many boba milk tea from different locations and restaurants and this one was one of the worst! Honestly, the only good thing that I had was the seaweed salad which was very good, but again, you can just go buy a seaweed salad done exactly the same way at the Asian supermarkets. Overall, not very impressed... at all! Probably won't be coming back anytime soon.
4 Awesome ramen! Flavorful broths and toppings. Noodles are great too. Love this place.
1 The customer service was terrible. When ordering, I told the cashier that this was my first time here and I knew of the restaurant from a flyer I read at work. I proceeded to ask the cashier what he would recommend. The cashier spoke in an extremely quiet voice , could barely hear him and he could not answer my question. As this was going on, I had noticed dirty tables all over the restaurant. Dirty dishes everywhere. I still continued with my order because the menu looked so delicious and I had planned on eating there for lunch and the place was busy. I ate outside because of all the empty dirty tables. It took 15 minutes , maybe a lil longer to be served my order. I wasn't even served , I actually had to go back to cashier and ask for my order. Honestly, the food was not worth all the poor customer service. I gave the restaurant a chance and I feel it was a waste of my time and money. I will never go back.
5 I love this place! Reminds me of my trip to Japan. I recommend the tonkatsu traditional style. If you haven't been and like Japanese food the definitely go!
2 The food wasn't bad...just not that good.   Service was a little bad, I took my buddy here for ramen after his recent move back from Japan....and after having to ask a few times for stuff, and then them making some juice(?) close to wear we were sitting, in the bar, it was so loud we had to continuously stop our conversation until they stopped- we both decided never to come back.   Such a shame...
4 Food=awesome Ambiance=regular Service=hit and miss (most employees are normal, but this time, cool guy taking order was as inviting as a rape van).
2 My stop here was at the request of my Son. Geeze the bowl I had was very bland and warm at best. The chicken was very tough and it tasted like they just threw it all together with tap water. I see why it might be popular for the students...inexpensive for the amount of food. But guys, there was no taste to it. My Sons also was bland. Now wonder there is so much Sriracha & dry spices around. But, it all needs to be cooked together in my opinion for flavor.
5 5 stars for the boba alone. I love their Thai milk tea! Lots of other flavors, but this is my favorite.
5 HEY YALL....boy oh boy am I glad against my best judgement of not feeling well am i glad that I left this hotel to come to this place Republic Ramen Noodles SWEET BABY JESUS...I ordered Tonkotsu Ramen added sweet corn and an order of tempura shrimp. I was very very tastee...The pork I added was not memorable,  but that was my focus either my main concern was the noodles( plentiful) and broth( hot & yummy )....When I go back later this week I will be ordering this again, but without meat nothing personal but when are we going up we ate Ramen all the time without meat it was just a bonus. Oh yea I had them to removed the bean sprouts and next time NO SPINACH. This is a must try anytime you come to Tempe, Arizona.
3 The ramen noodles are always soft and soggy.  If you know how to cook ramen, then you know this is a no-no.  The pork slices are top rate.  Excellent meat.  The fresh ingredients on the noodles are awesome as well.  3 star rating is because the broth sucked and the noodles suck.  I will try something other than ramen noodles here and hopefully it will be much better.
2 This time, I only ordered a boba milk tea, and I was completely underwhelmed. The tea itself tasted like my first attempt making my own milk tea when I was in middle school; I had to concentrate extremely hard to discern the faint tea flavor.  However, the boba's texture was definitely on point.
4 I ordered the Shio Ramen and it was delicious! Although it was a tad salty for my taste. But it's a great price for the amount you get of soup. Definitely a unique place!
5 Visited a boy at ASU, and he recommended this place. I wasn't disappointing, this place was awesome! I tried the Vegetarian Ramen, and it was meatless, and wonderful. Much like me after my cleanse.   I would totally go there again.. I guess it depends on if I see this boy again. :)
5 Great food!!! And the service was pretty good to. We were shocked at how good the broth was. We will for sure be going back.
2 Not a very good experience.  Wanted to like this place but it was very disappointing.   Long line and understaffed.   Ordered Ice tea, was very watery and tasted like tap water , plus  had no ice in the machine. Had to ask twice for them to refill the ice.    Overall poorly managed restaurant. Ramen was mediocre.  If you have a choice,  go to Umami, it is a night and day difference in quality and service.
5 I had the Republic Ramen with original toppings and tofu. The broth was my favorite part because it had just the right amount of heat. I really enjoyed the ramen just beware that the portions are huge! I also got the mango snow boba. It was a little too sweet for my taste but still very delicious. The food came really fast, went here at around 7 pm.
1 I have visited Republic of Ramen a second time, I was told by a friend that there was a change in management and that the overall food quality has improved. However, she is greatly mistaken.  The last time I visited, I found my tongue to be numb after the experience, I thought it was excessive use of MSG. This time, I realized, that might not have been the only case. The broth is so salty I couldn't taste the nuances of the dashi stock, if that's the stock they use. I tried adding two cups of water into the broth to dilute it out to figure out what was in the broth, but it was still too salty.  I ordered: Shoyu Ramen (traditional) chicken with extra egg, noodles, extra chicken and extra pork Shio Ramen (traditional) beef Tip: 15%  Bill: $19.47 + tip = $22.39   To say that this place is salty would be incorrect. This place uses a 'dangerous' amount of salt in my opinion. Some people say that ramen should be slurped. Well I didn't slurp the ramen, but my lips felt like a layer had been removed/dried and cured after the meal. I thought I was the only one, my companion agreed with me as well, and she uses a shoot load of salt in her cooking.  All in all, there isn't much to comment about this place, it's 'Asian Hip' in ambiance, it had a friendly sort of staff, the sake is from a box and the ramen is salty as hell (I never use hell but it deserves it here). Oh did I add, we both got food poisoning even though they received a mark of A on cleanliness?
5 This place is awesome! Really tasty! The republic ramen is the best! I used to live in Japan and this is the closest thing to real Japanese ramen I have been able to get to the real thing since returning to the states.
5 OK so let me start off by saying this place is called Republic RAMEN+NOODLES. Their soups are out of this world, I have yet to have every single one, but coming close. They are good for what they are known for their FOOD. Me and my boyfriend keep on going back because they are so good.  Now Milk Teas: The place is not called anything close to resembling milk teas. They are not the best that I have tasted, but that's not why I'm going there for. I'm there for the FOOD :)
5 I love this place great ramen my favorite is the republic it's a little spicy but that's what I like about it. It's not to hot or spicy just right. The other ramen are pretty good too! The environment is really relaxing not to loud or crowded. I always crave this place and always coming back
5 The other half and I eat here fairly regularly and we love it. He's veg and I eat meat and we can both customize our meals the way we like them. Having spent time in Japan, my other half vouches for the food and approximated authenticity here. I don't know authentic Japanese cuisine per se, but I can tell you that a heaping bowl of tonkotsu, the size of my head and then some, definitely fills this big boy's belly every time. I've had the curry bowl as well as the noodles and all are excellent. The shrimp & veggie tempura are great as well and the sweet, dark dipping sauce that accompanies the fried delights also ends up in my soup, to boot. Color me addicted. The staff is young and knowledgeable, and have accommodated some very tricky dietary demands from friends of ours with very specific food allergies.  Best of all, it doesn't cost us an arm & a leg for a hugely satisfying meal. Highly recommended gem of an Asian restaurant in Tempe AZ.
5 I LOVE Republic Ramen. I have been holding my birthday and friends' surprise birthday parties here now for a couple of years, because the food is delicious and inexpensive, the staff are very nice, and among my friends and I, we all just love ramen. My typical order is a tonkotsu ramen (very rich, creamy pork broth) and a thai iced tea boba! It is absolutely delicious, and even while writing this review, I am now craving some ramen from here. I have tried to recreate their tonkotsu broth at my home with no such luck! It is simply the best from here!  Also, for me personally, Cherry Blossum cafe was not nearly as good as Republic Ramen, it was just not as satisfying in the broth. I know everyone is different, but that is just my two cents! I will continue recommend Republic Ramen to all of my friends!
4 I love this place ! It's a regular stop when I'm in that part of town. A solid selection of ramen bowls that has something to offer for everyone. I usually start with some edamame and shrimp or vegy tempura. The wife and kids like it before we head over to the climbing walls next door. Nothing fancy, just good.
4 Coming from LA, I always crave good ramen. Knowing I can't place the same high standards as back home places, I didn't think this place was that bad. I was actually pretty surprised. I'd been to cherry blossom and didn't like theirs.   I had the Tokyo ramen which they say is a light and spicy tonkotsu ramen with the original toppings. It is lighter than a normal tonkotsu broth but certainly was not spicy at all. But flavor was pretty decent. I liked that the original toppings came with spinach and carrots.  For the price (I think it was $7.50) you got a really good sized bowl.  Bf had the republic ramen which was a pretty spicy one.  He did say that the spiciness builds up.  I didn't think his broth was as flavorful as mine but he still liked it lots. Interestingly my bf didn't eat all his noodles so I got to eat part of his too and his noodles tasted differently.  And it's not bc of the broths so not sure if the noodles are dif.  Place is clean and staff was pretty good. For all those times you can't go to Cali for ramen and having a craving, this is a pretty decent sub.
4 Everytime I come to the Phoenix area I make a stop in here for a bowl of tonkotsu ramen with traditional toppings and some gyoza. Some of the better ramen I've had since leaving Las Vegas. If you see the sign and think cup ramen you are dead wrong. After this you will never go back to instant.
4 The freshly made broth is amazing!  I've had 3 different ones so far and they are all great!  I personally love the thick udon noodles too.  The Thai Tea boba could have been better.  One order of soup really feeds 2 people or a 2nd serving at home.
1 My girl and I popped in after our Friday movie at 8:30. We wait at the front counter for 5 minutes waiting to place our order but nobody came but not for lack of people. There was a girl mopping a spilled drink right by the counter and she never acknowledged us. There was a guy with a mustache that came out from the back and walked the length of counter twice he looked at us but just put his head like we weren't there. Needless to say we're eating Thai food now. Would've loved to try this place but apparently they didn't want our business. Good luck with that business model.
5 I love ramen, and I am not talking about the cheap garbage you buy from the grocery store.  I love the good stuff, and Republic Ramen does it right.  I ordered the extra spicy Republic Ramen with chicken, and it was great.  I enjoyed it so much.  Every drop of the soup was a symphony of sensation on my taste buds.  I was in heaven, but I am getting ahead of myself.  We started the dinner with an order of Shrimp Purses and Gyoza.  The price was four and three dollars respectively, and they came out in a hurry.  They were fresh, and they were great.  They were gone in a flash.  The main course was in a gigantic bowl, and that was way more than I could eat in a sitting.  I mostly ate the excellent broth, and I took the rest home to eat that night.  Man, I loved that place so much.  I will definitely go there again.  A+++ in my book!
3 Sooo I had been wanting to try this place for awhile and I wasn't impressed as much as everyone says in their reviews. I had the republic and although spicy which I love the broth itself was bland. They do give you a huge amount for the price the pork gyoza was good wish they could have steamed them or offered that instead of frying. The restaurant itself was clean employees were nice but they need to work on their broth .
4 Solid spot!  Generous servings, and flavorful broths to satisfy your cravings.  I had the Tokyo ramen with pork and added an egg, corn and garlic puree.  The broth was light with just enough kick from the spice and the vegetables were very fresh.  We also had an order of gyoza and the shrimp purse.  Both were good but the ramen was clearly the star.  Next time I'm in the area I will have to make a point of stopping back in.
4 I finally had a chance to come to place again with my cousin. Everyone I know thinks this place is not all that great, but I have a difference in opinion. Let's see, I always end up ordering the chili pepper ramen with beef and egg. Can't go wrong. I think the ingredients they use are fresh and tasty. The broth is really good with a little dose of their special spicy powder they have. Customer service was good and it just has a chill, laid back vibe to it in which I can't complain about.
4 I love their Ramen soup! I always order their miso soup with spam, it's delicious! I've taken a few people here and they also like it.   My only complaint is that in the summer it feels like it's 80 degrees in there. After eating the soup, you come out sweating! Seriously you're selling soup in 105+ weather! The restaurant should be at least a chilly 75...don't be cheap and crank that AC!
4 The ramaen was ok, The Tonkatsu lacked depth, but it is the only place I know in Arizona that I can get Tonkatsu any day, for that alone it earned 4 stars.
2 They ran out of boba last time I came here. :-( and it was 2.5 hours before they closed.
