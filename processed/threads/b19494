5 Lived in house for 9 years and just thought was time to replace the carpeting, had used some of those "$99 room" services over the years for routine cleaning, met Ray Odom, Owner of Hydro-Pro, and gave them a crack at cleaning the carpets before I replaced them. I was Amazed at results, by the time they were done the carpets looked brand new, took their time and did incredibally throrugh job.  Great service at reasonable price-well worth it. My carpet cleaner from now on.
5 Had water damage at my new office this past summer during one of our big rainstorms.  I called AZ Hydropro and within 3 hours they were there working on a Saturday no less.  We had around 800-1000sq ft of water damage including seepage 3 feet up the dry wall, and within 72 hours the floors and walls were bone dry.  Best of all you couldn't even tell they had been there.  Truly amazing customer service and quality.  Would highly recommend them to anyone!
1 *******DO NOT USE***** They will promise you they will take care of all your problems, yeah nice guys kick you when you are down.  House was flooded....came in and told me they would directly bill the insurance company.  After four days and $9,000.00 later of water clean up....without ever sending myself or an invoice to the insurance company....he puts a Lien on my home.  Also, they take advantage of single women, beware.  *******DO NOT USE*****
5 Arizona Hydro-Pro was great, they explained every detail in the process, and give us an idea what to expect in the cleaning of the wool carpets. They were really quick, professional, and very friendly. I am impressed by this company and would recommend Arizona Hydro-Pro to everyone.
5 Holy Carpet Cleaner Batman!!! Tim and Ray Odom With AZ Hydro Pro came and save our carpet (again)! Chris Tousley was absolutely getting new carpet this week as it is terribly embarrassing to have this in our home. LOOK what happened. Tim also said we have really good carpet and it will last another 5-6 years with their care. Go for it! I dare you to save me a few thousand dollars. -- feeling wonderful.
