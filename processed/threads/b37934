5 This wellness spa offers a holistic approach to beauty with a variety of services and classes. Staff is friendly, professional, and knowledgable. I also recommend the sugaring services.
5 A great place to come for sugaring. The staff is fabulous, they make you feel welcome and comfortable and take great care of you. Their approach is holistic and thorough.
5 I LOVE the services at this wellness spa. The nail specialist "Stacy", is very artistic and creative. She knows her business and is very articulate and professional. The Saturday Pilates/Yoga class is a great way to start your weekend. Very affordable. You do have to RSVP for the class. Every other Saturday they offer a doTERRA essential oil class for a minimal fee.  They choose several oils to spotlight, you learn how to make products using the oils, and take them home. For example: cleaning products, facial toners, children's jewelry for oils, sanitizers for children and classrooms etc. I try to make every class. Amber gives a great facial and is full of knowledge. I love the atmosphere and am making new friends each time I visit the spa.
5 I enjoy & love the warm, welcoming feeling of the spa.  Everyone is always so nice & smiling.  My Saturday mornings are a me moment time & I enjoy doing the Pilates class.  Michael also provides amazing massages.  They also have unique jewelry pieces, Do Terra oils, makeup & nutritional supplements...  Five stars!!!!
