5 I couldn't be happier with the service and products I received from International Minute Press.  I'm a small business owner and needed 1,000 high-quality business cards and 200 fliers in a crunch.  The staff were incredibly helpful, gave me the parameters I needed for design purposes, and had an easy online system for submitting content.  Even though I was stressed out, they made the process easy.  I had used International Minute Press once before for a separate run of business cards, and was happy.  But I was thrilled with how they came through for me on a tight deadline and budget.  Thank you!
1 Stay faaaaaar faaaaaar away!   My order was completed without my approval and was charged more than was told. Not to mention I was treated horribly when I came to pick it up.  Sure, they work fast, but they take it upon themselves to print and increase prices without being told.   Safe to say it will be the last time I come here.
5 Originally I chose this establishment because of it's convenience. I continue to come here over other places because of their fair pricing and excellent customer service. Not once has anyone been rude to me. I can only recall one time out of the last year when there was a glitch in my order, and it was rectified promptly. Franchise or not, this place has always felt "mom and pop" to me.
