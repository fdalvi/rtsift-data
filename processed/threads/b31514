4 Nice, clean laundromat. Plenty of new machines, and the dryers are great too. I wish they some of those baskets on wheels to carry the clothes from the washer to the dryer. I always end up dropping items. It's in a great location. Theres a Circle K, a bar, and a Mexican restaurant in the same shopping plaza. So,l you can grab a drink or a meal while you're washing your clothes!
5 Good facilities, easy access, relatively well maintained.  I always come here for my laundry.
5 Decent facilities. One reason I gave it five stars is because the owner was super nice and friendly to everyone. He was cleaning and sprucing up the place while I was doing my laundry. Also, I didn't have to wait for a machine and I did laundry in under an hour because of the super speedy dryers!
2 At 5 a.m. it was filthy. The washers were anyway and there is only one cart and there was what appeared to be a homeless person sleeping on the chairs. Two stars for being open 24 hours. Will not return. Sorry.
