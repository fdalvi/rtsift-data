5 This is the best store that exists in all the land. Nostalgia galore.If you miss the very best of your childhood, you can probably relieve moments from picking up a piece of it at this store.
5 Owner is extremely nice and an extremely talented artist. I went in this place when it first opened and it was all his art with a few miscellaneous pieces of comics but now it has become a small nerd-oasis of comics, memorabilia and of course his very well done art. Definitely check this place out.
5 We LOVE Sour Apple Gallery!!!!  Lots of great 80's relics (He-Man, Star Wars, Garbage Pail Kids, etc).  Be sure to check out David's AMAZING artwork featuring your favorite super heroes, comic book characters and movie villains.... I've already bought a Boba Fett, Batman and Poison Ivy print. Can't stop!  :)
