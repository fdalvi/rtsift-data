1 I am very disappointed in this doctor!!!! I feel cheated and lied to! I will never use him again! I have been a patient of DR. Burroff's for the past 3 1/2 years. I have just found out by my NEW doctor that Dr. Burroff has been prescribing me psychiatric medications that I DO NOT even need, for an illness i DO NOT even have!!! I feel as though my life has been pushed back because i have not been fixing my real illness but merely putting a blanket to cover it up ! I have been taking Lithium for 3 years and Pristiq for 1 1/2 years.                                                                                                                                                                         I was diagnosis with bipolar by several therapist 4 years ago by filling out certain question airs, that  passed as"bipolar". One therapist had told me to work aside with a doctor with my new information, my choice. who treats bipolar i thought? I had no clue! I found Dr. Burroff through my insurance as listed as "in my network". Taking a chance with any doctor i assumed could help me, i started to see him. Even though he is internal medicine and bipolar had been a foreign thing to me, i picked him and trusted his knowledge and schooling as i started to introduce my symptoms to him. Like most people you dont know whats wrong with you but strictly only what your symptoms are, right? You trust and have faith they have all the answers!  Dr. Burroff had never ran any tests about my brain. Because he never did, i assumed there were no tests to determine whats going on in my head! How should i know, im the patient! I have just found out from my NEW doctor that there are tests out there! I couldnt believe it! I feel DR. Burroff is unfamiliar or unaware that there are tests by neuroscience labs!  I had explained to my NEW doctor just recently the same symptoms i had told Dr. Burroff 3 1/2 years ago. She really digged into my history which important fact that i am adopted. I have no clue about my genetic background. Wanting to come up with her own conclusions aside from what pre diagnosis Dr. Burroff and past therapists have labeled me as, she had a hunch of whats wrong with me. She spent about 30 min talking with me when Dr. Burroff has never spent more than 5 min with me on any given visit. I never felt he really wanted to take the time to listen to what i was saying. Always rushed! I don't know if some doctors choose to educate themselves or are just simply are interested in one illness over the other  but i really felt compared to Dr. Burroff my NEW doctor truly knew her craft WELL and took time to seriously help me! She felt my pain!   My NEW doctor had me do a urine test that was sent out to a lab called Pharmasan Labs Neuroscience a couple months ago. When the results came in, I was extremely shocked to find that the test showed a complete different illness on it than what Dr. Burroff was trying to treat!  i found i DO NOT have bipolar but something called COMT!!!   COMT : catechol-o-methyl transferase an enzyme that deactivates the catecholamines dopa, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. It is a genetic mutation that inhibits production of this enzyme.   The foods i was eating on a regular day to day basis i DO NOT digest at all. This specific genetic mutation is not equipped to do so on certain foods that are gluten, processed sugar and meats, wheat and alcohol. My body was acting like it was having an allergic reaction. COMT side affects are same attributes as Bipolar! Those foods i was eating were getting in the way of my brains neurotransmitters to work properly. Also known as "the gut and brain connection" My neuroscience lab test showed that my Serotonin, Taurine, PEA and Epinephrine levels were dangerously low.      If Dr. Burroff will ever read this some day, I would just want him to know, if you know very little about a mental illness or any illness that you aren't familiar with enough, please do not try and quick fix a problem as big as this. Withdrawing from heavy medication like lithium and Pristiq that i had to get off of because i did not need was not fun! Or if you are knowledgeable, please, please update your information. Because of one lab test you didn't know about or decided to no give me the option to do, fucked up my life in so many ways! I just now am starting to feel really get fixed!
1 This is a badly run taco truck posing as a doctor's office. They double book patients (i.e. several people will have the same appointment time to see the same doctor and unless he is a super mutant I don't know how that is possible). The "ladies" behind the front desk are rude and poorly trained. We were an hour early for our appointment and waited an additional hour after the appointment time to be seen. Magically everyone who spoke the same language as the workers behind the desk were seen first. If this isn't bad enough he prescribed medicine without encouraging any lifestyle changes or giving a reason to my elderly mother. Luckily I've already found a better doctor for her but if you have a loved one going to this doctor I strongly urge and suggest you to at the very least monitor them if not take them somewhere else.
5 Looking for the right Doctor is not always easy. I was referred by a freind thank goodness. Dr. Buroff and his staff were very kind and proffessional. The front desk girls were sweet and happy to help you. Dr. Buroff is extremely kind and took the time to listen and take a deep concern with my  health issues. I had a alot of question  and he was happy to help. He was very busy, the office was packed! But he never made me feel rushed. Its a great feeling after your appointment to feel taken care of. I highly recommend Dr. Buroff as a wonderful person and DR.  Thank you,  Debbie Summer Massoud
