5 Great, friendly service! Scanning, copies, and shipping all done while making you laugh!
5 I love this location for FedEx / UPS / Postal / DHL shipping. Postnet is your go-to spot for copies, printing and shipping services, computer and Internet access, and some basic office/mailing supplies. You can also rent a mailbox here for a reasonable yearly rate; AND Postnet will sign & receive your packages, then call you up to let you know it's there!  I needed a quick portfolio item printed, without the hassle of going into the city. The service was great. Steve, the owner was incredibly accommodating and patient with my slightly deranged requests. He was kind enough to print my entire project on two types of paper, just so I could be confident with my decision and he only charged me for one. I will definitely be going back for all my printing needs.   All in all, great and efficient service for the simple copying jobs I needed done.
5 My boyfriends company has been doing business with this PostNet store for the last 4 years. Service is friendly, prompt and helpful.  I highly recommend it.
1 I had this PostNet location pack and ship a very fragile large heirloom. They did a bad job and it arrived at destination totally broken. I insured it for the value $500 and had PostNet send it via Federal Express. I supplied the owner of this PostNet with necessary information to file a Fed Ex claim within 10 days of item arriving broken. Owner never followed through on filing claim with Fed Ex! I checked back with owner many weeks later and he denied ever getting paperwork to file claim. By that point when I tried to file claim direct with Fed Ex them said that it was too late to file claim. Now I'm out $500! I'd never recommend them to anyone for shipping.
