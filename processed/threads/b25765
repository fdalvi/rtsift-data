5 I got my first vape pen here. Mohammad has been extremely helpful with it. Mohammad goes above and beyond to help customers.   The staff in general really care about their customers. Very reasonable prices and great selection!
5 This place is by far the best smoke shop around.  I live in Queen Creek and I prefer to make the 30+ minute drive just for my vaping needs.  The prices are the best your gonna get (even better than the internet site I have been using for years). The guy that works there is awesome!  I have been having issues with my battery and he fixed the problem no questions asked!  He is very nice and really goes the extra mile to help out his customers!!  Thank you Angel Eyes!!
