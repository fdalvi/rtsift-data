5 If your visiting or live in Arizona this is a great place to get your tattoo done. I heard they even do permanent make up now that I might have to try on my next visit.
5 I have been to New Heights Tattoo & Piercing multiple times and have been more than happy with the service that has been given to me. The staff is very friendly and welcoming and the shop is a clean, comfortable environment to be in. Chris Hill has pierced and tattooed me multiple times and I couldn't be happier with the results. I plan on going here in the future for any other work I would like done. I would also recommend anyone looking for quality service to go to new heights, you won't be disappointed.
5 Was referred to this place by a few friends. Im not into this stuff at all but got a gift certificate  for a family member to get a piercing.  they were super nice and made me feel at ease in this new environment.  the place was very clean and modern.  Im even thinking of looking into getting a tattoo.  not sure yet. We will see.
