1 Don't know this side of town well so I am embarrassed that I got there shortly before closing and couldn't apologize more to the staff yet it didn't work.   Staff members were terribly rude and I know they don't own the place but its just paper products... its not that complicated...   Asked for some shipping advice since I had awkward shaped packages..and was starred back at with an empty glaze...you got the jist...
1 SERIOUSLY DISAPPOINTING. Take 2 printers, 3 PC workstations, shove them in the back of a FedEx shipping office, abuse the former legacy of Kinko's by claiming you offer print services and you get this waste of commercial office space that tries to pass itself off as a Print & Ship Center. It's a Ship Center with printing as an after thought.   Compared to other former Kinko's locations that ACTUALLY HAS SEVERAL PRINTERS and other pieces of equipment this place comes across as a joke and needs to be closed. Add in absolutely clueless, uninspired, and pathetic service and the best advice anyone can give is to tell you to stay on Stephanie St. and just keep driving. Don't go here.
4 I normally loathe going to one these places but I have to say that the two employees today were actually very helpful and friendly!  I have encountered locations that make me wanna hurl by the attitudes the employees normally have.  There were two ladies working and they both asked me if I needed assistance!  Shocker!!!  I have to be back Sunday and I'm not dreading it one bit!
4 Great products, great turn-around time, I have never had a bad experience with them!
1 this location wont ship over 75lb while the one close to galleria mall does can sombody explain? and that teenage blonde mgr is worthless: bad coustomer service bad attitude.....
3 I like Sandra, she's really knowledgable. She's really friendly and goes out of her way to assist you. I normally don't drive this far but would rather go here than the post office.
