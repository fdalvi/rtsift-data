5 Mayfield Village is an amazing Chinese takeaway which has a good atmosphere, pleasant service, but incredible food.  I've been here twice and both times the meal was served in generous, filling portions and probably tasted better than any other Chinese I've been to.  The menu is extensive and has a full range of authentic Chinese dishes.  The first time I was in I went for the stir fried beef in black bean sauce with egg fried rice.  The staff were proper friendly and the order only took about five minutes to be cook.  I would have waited ten times as long for it because it just tasted so good!   The last time I was there I went for te salt and pepper squid which, again, was amazing.  Their prices are as you would expect with mains costing around Â£5.  If you're after top quality Chinese takeaway food then this is the place to come.
3 Hmmm not as good as it used to be.
