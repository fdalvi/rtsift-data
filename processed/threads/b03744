4 Thanksgiving Tour We wobbled up the mountain Saw Amazing Views
3 I took my two boys on this adventure and I guess I was expecting more. We went up Bulldog Canyon and it was beautiful, but I was expecting a little more excitement in the hummer (steeper terrain or some thrills) plus some deeper expertise from our guide. We got neither. It was an experience that we will sort of remember, but think it may worth looking around for other options.
