5 Imagine if Tabatha Coffey decided to revamp Jesse James' Monster Garage into a Barber Shop and Salon, and that's basically what you get with Floyd's 99 Barbershop.  As I walked into the newly constructed shop, I was greeted by Hells Bells blasting on the radio and had to remind myself not to start bobbing my head to the great beats that were playing while razor sharp shears buzzed around my face.  Unfortunately there was no wait when I walked in; I say unfortunately because the place is full of eye candy from the poster wall of Rock and Roll Idols to the cool toolboxes turned cabinets.  I also learned afterward that there are free computers for browsing the interwebs, and the receptionist will take your music requests if you have any.  I took advantage of their grand opening's half-price special which ended up costing me a little over $11 after tax.  I was seriously torn between a 4 or 5-star rating simply because this place is a bit expensive IMO, but you definitely get what you pay for.  In my case, what I paid for was a hair cut executed just as I had requested by stylist Neda, a neck shave via a guarded razor and heated shaving cream (nice touch as I'm a sucker for a clean neck), a massage, a post haircut wash and rinse (which is great since I hate having stray hairs all over the place), and last but not least a styling to finish things off.  Anyway, I'm not sure if many people know of this place but I was definitely pleased with the unique experience.  ;)
5 I couldn't agree with Thomas C. more. Very good description of the place! The place brings so many nostalgic feelings with the band posters, crome accessories, leather chairs, if Kat Von D decided to do hair, this would be the place. Very fresh and young.   As they cut a few inches off of my long hair and started added layering, they said they noticed my hair length was cut crooked previously, and have not grown out even yet. (I guess that's what happens when you visit supercuts). She immediately fixed it and didn't cut it too short or leave it too long.   After the cut she asked me if I wanted a massage?! I was like, "how much?" She said it was included in the price already, so it was free! I was like....sweeettt!! I've never heard of a massage included in a haircut I guess. But then the thought of making her work on a massage after a hard-worked hair cut was just wrong. So I said no thanks, but definitely next time.  I take a peek at Kris and he's enjoyed his massage to the point of sleeping in his chair! Too bad he couldn't see me through his warm towel pulled over his face! Lucky bastard..
2 I was pretty excited to try this place because I was looking for a good barbershop near home (i.e. NOT greatclips) and the price felt right. I went in for a clipper trim and wanted my beard done, too. A barbershop should be able to do beards, and have straight edge razors to do behind the ears an neck. I got some girl who must've not been much older than 17 who seemed completely unsure how to cut men. I had to tell her to use the clippers on my head (my hair was about 2 inches and I wanted half off - not something you can do with scissors!). Then she edged my neck with a closer clipper instead of a razor, which was ok.   I asked her to do my beard because she looked like she was finishing up. She asked me how to do it. (?!) I told her to use the clipper blade, trim it around, scissors on the edges, level out the edge on my neck and shave around the edges. She just looked at me and grabbed the clippers. She did the main parts and then had no idea how to do my moustache. She struggled with it, and completely skipped my neck. I was totally disgusted by this time and just let her stop.   Sure, they got good deals on haircuts, but I got charged over $20 for the beard. I was royally annoyed and won't be back, ever.
4 Oh, I love this place. The descriptions from the previous Yelpers are spot on. They play a great rock soundtrack. Everything from Led Zepplin to Linkin Park. This is not really a barber shop so nobody should be expecting that. It's more of a typical hair salon with hair dressers that are trying to get dudes away from Great Clips, and I hope they succeed.  Rock posters are plastered right on top of each other, made me feel like my bedroom from my high school daze. It really sets the atmosphere, like you know when you walk up to a bar and you have no choice but to sit next to the old guy by himself and you kinda don't want to but then you realize that you know that at least you're in for an interesting conversation. It's that kind of atmosphere, cause I usually don't talk much to my stylist but these girls can talk, and they do. But it's always fun.   For around $25 you get your hair shampooed and conditionered (?), a hair cut, razor cut around the back edges, hot steam towels, and an awesome massage with some contraption that is best described as a vibrating glove (I'm afraid to go into any more detail than that).  A couple TV's have sports on them. There's also a couple computers with internet so you can surf while you wait. They also do color and other girlie things, I don't know.  I've never had a bad haircut here and I almost everyone there has done my hair at least once. Great place! Check em out!
5 I, too, couldn't agree more with Tomas C. This place is great! When they first moved to this location, I figured it was more of a stereotypical oldschool barbershop...boy was I wrong! My husband actually checked them out first and raved about how great this place is so I had to check it out for myself! YES, they do womens hair and they do an amazing job-MUCH better than supercuts, greatclips and arizona hair co!! I haven't had coloring done here but my husband did. He sports the fauxhawk and got black and red down the middle-the stylist definitely did a great job on the funky coloring!   Walk-ins are always welcome and I always get in really fast-the only time I was told there'd be a 20min wait, I popped over to Starbucks next door for a drink and when I came back 5min later, they were ready for me.   Pricing isn't too bad-they charged $24 for a shampoo, layered cut, and offered up a free massage (I turned it down). $21 for a mens cut.   Oh, they have 1/2 priced cuts for police officers and firefighters if you show your badge!
5 Great place for a haircut!
4 *UPDATE* - the stylist I've been using for over a year recently left to go work somewhere else, so I had to lower my rating from 5 stars down to 4.  My original review is below...   Best haircut place in the East Valley!  I initially tried a new stylist each time I came in(they were so, so), until I ended up with Emily.  I've been scheduling with her for about a year now, and couldn't be happier with how my hair is cut each month!  Great atmosphere, good music and very friendly staff.  They even have a computer setup for web browsing if you are bored while waiting to get your haircut.  Tip #1:  Go to the website and see when your stylist is scheduled to work, and then call that morning to make an appointment(they only take same-day appointments).    Tip #2:  This place is in the same parking lot as "Luke's of Chicago".  So if you like Chicago style Italian Beefs, hot dogs and burgers, it's a great place to stop for some good eats!
4 Floyd's is on point. They've got a hip feel to their shop, The people who work there seem to enjoy it and they have good music playing in the background. For a cut, wash, straight razor trim, hot towel and shoulder massage...for $21. Done. Write it up!
4 Even though Chandler is FAR to go for a haircut I'm glad I went. I read their ads in GQ and kind of felt that Floyd's was place was for me. I love my Russian Jewish barber to death but they're closed by the time I get off work during the week and it goes without saying that they're closed on Saturday which is the next best time for me to go for a haircut. But enough about that.  Floyd's has a cool vibe. They play good tunes and have computers for surfing the web if you have a wait. Danie was my stylist and as this was my first time with her and with Floyd's she put me immediately at ease. She asked me what I wanted. I was going a little extreme from longer hair to a short cut and she was very careful in making sure that she was giving me what I wanted. She did a test on the clippers to make sure it wasn't too short and double checked after cutting off the bulk of my hair if I wanted to go shorter. She was not very chit-chatty which I appreciate. Not that I don't like to to talk. But you know how it is when you go to a new stylist and it's awkward when they try to chat you up? Danie was not like that, I did not feel awkward where I had to answer a bunch of icebreaker questions or make smalltalk. It was a really pleasant and great experience working with her-she is awesome and has a great sense of humor. She gave me a GREAT haircut and styling, followed by a wash, AWESOME head massage and finally a straight razor neck shave and a hot towel. Best of all is the price. I've gone to a few high-end salons and barbers and finished $40 lighter in my wallet. I got all of the above: stellar service, good vibe, great haircut, wash/head massage, shave, hot towel and styling for $21-doesn't get better than that. Their hours are also convenient as they stay open until 9:00pm during the week. I really like what I got at Floyd's and will be back despite the drive-it's worth it for me
5 So I've been going to V's barber shop for years and for the money Floyd's 99 beats them hands down. I'm always excited when I find a new haircutter and Tara is my new favorite. Very friendly, attention to detail, trimmed my eyebrows, warm towels on your face/neck, scalp massage with tea tree shampoo that makes your head tingle and straight razor for your neck. She cut my wife's hair and she absolutely loved it too! So take your lady for a couple trip here, she can take your FB pic as you get your nose hair waxed. I recommend Tara and Floyd's 99!
4 First impression wasn't what I expected.  Honestly, this place could have just as easily been a tattoo parlor.  It was far different than any other place I've been into.  Posters all over the walls, music playing, and the staff all tatted up, pierced, and all that jazz.  I was digging it!  I recommend calling ahead, which I did.  They seemed pretty busy.  I was impressed they were cutting kids hair too, and they actually looked like they enjoyed cutting kids hair.  So I got called up, and met "Jason"(I put it in quotes, because when I saw his business card, it was spelled J-Sin... LOL!).  J-sin was a cool cat and fit the vibe of the place, pink hair and all.  When I started telling him what I was thinking for my hair, he was actually listening, and asking questions!  I was impressed.  He was a good conversationist, he had a few laughs, joked with the barber next to us, and just had a good time.  The cut was fantastic.  I also got a hot towel for my face while he shampooed my hair, and gave me a nice shave on the neck.  Overall I was VERY impressed, and it was reasonably priced for the amount of service.  I will definitely be going back to J-sin.
5 Head spa is great! inside store and people are nice!
1 Barber Capes is not clean at all! Others' hair is still left on it ! The worst experience I have ever had.  I went for just hair wash and blow dry. They charged me 16 box without showed me any kind of price list. My scalp feel more itch before wash.
1 My mother and I just received two of the worst haircuts we've ever had from this place. Why do stylists never go off the picture the client brings in? I've been to cosmetology school, we didnt show them unreasonable cuts for our type of hair.  But nevertheless, neither one of us got what we asked for. My bob (how hard is it to get. Bob right?) looked decent in the salon even though it was way too short and I ended up looking more like Victoria Beckham than I wanted to. When I got home I noticed how choppy, blunt, and uneven the cut really was.  Then they messed up my mother's beautiful naturally curly hair. Not to mention two girls had to cut her hair because one was overbooked, which is very unprofessional in my opinion. The first girl had her hair looking like a stacked mess of poodle hair from the 80's. the second started to just style it, and it looked horrible until we spoke up. Once again it looked absolutely nothing like what she wanted. Then it was straightened and trimmed a bit more, which looked a little better but ended up looking like Mrs. Brady's shag. Absolutely awful. When my mother said she didn't like it, she was told, "you'll get used to it". It was our fault for not being bigger bitches and demanding they fix it or refund our money. Now I have to pay someone else to get it fixed, thanks a lot Floyd's.
1 barbershop like i've never experienced before...and don't care to again.  was looking forward to a haircut and hot lather shave, a little extra pampering...not here, not with Traci.  no shampoo, no relaxing shoulder massage.  cold, methodical, rushed, maybe she hates her job, maybe floyds doesn't have standards, don't know, don't care at this point
5 I am really shocked at the negative reviews for Floyd's. I have been here twice now and have had nothing but awesomeness in terms of service. My barber's name first time around was Valerie so I asked for her my second visit and I will keep going back.    As one person mentioned, this place gets busy so it is worth it to call ahead.  They do not take appointments days in advance but you can book same day appointments. I arrived a few minutes early and only waited a few minutes while she finished her last appointment.    After the cut, she finished with a really awesome shampoo and scalp massage followed which was accompanied by a hot towel face treatment.  Top that off with a neck and shoulder massage using  a power tool designed for the service and it all adds up to awesomeness and all that for $21 + tip!  My haircut has received multiple compliments in just three days so I cannot find anything to complain about.    A final though on some of the incongruous reviews listed herein. For people complaining about pricing, I don't know what to tell them, there is a gigantic pricing board on the wall. It is practically impossible to miss.  I would seriously question someone who claims they had no idea what the prices are.   I had been to several other salons and barber shops since moving to Arizona and been underwhelmed by the service before finding Floyd's 99 Barbershop. This place is the best. I will never go anywhere else.
3 I came in last weekend, long overdue for a trim. My boyfriend has been here several times and always has a pleasant experience-I know this place sees a lot of male clientele however a girl I follow on YouTube whose hair I adore goes to another Floyd's location so I made an assumption that they'd do just as good of a job on women's cuts.  I went in for a trim and to get bangs. I asked for half moon bangs. As the stylist started trimming my hair, she looked concerned (or maybe it was a concentrated look? Who knows). I brought up my hair color which I know isn't that perfect looking at the moment but that wasn't it. Apparently my hair had been over texturized the last time I got it cut so it looked like I had a lot of split ends. Fair enough, I was happy that was brought to my attention. However, when it came to my bangs, she was uncomfortable doing what I asked for which was half moon bangs. She had her boss do them. I had indicated that I wanted them longish. What I got was way shorter than what was requested, and when I went home I noticed that my bangs were not cut all the way across my forehead-when the stylist finished my bangs she had arranged my layers so that it covered that area (which is why I didn't notice it at first). I didn't say anything about the shortness because honestly, what's the point? That can't be fixed. Thankfully hair grows.. The rest of my hair looks fine and I really appreciated the stylist's suggestion about different products to use to improve the quality of my hair.  I'm on the fence about whether I'd go back-however I would recommend them if you're a guy. My boyfriend always gets great haircuts from Floyd's.
4 This place is awesome. In fact, it is the only place we've found that actually knows what a razor-faded high-and-tight is! My husband goes to Crystal and she does an excellent high-and-tight. He also enjoys the hot lather straight razor shave for his face. Even when she just uses clippers everything is even and well-trimmed. I go to Valerie. She is very skilled and pays great attention to detail. She also gives the best scalp massage ever! And I was a professional massage therapist for 7 years so that says something.   Floyd's knows how to make a hair appointment an experience. We really enjoy the attention to detail, like the hot towels infused with tea tree oil. And I appreciate that they offer a variety of services for men and women so we no longer have to go to two different locations. I've never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for my appointment either.   I appreciate the environment too, especially how the barbers/hair stylists personalize their tool boxes and stations. It adds to the experience. I hate going to generic locations where the stylists basically rent a station for the day. When I go to Floyd's I know my hair stylist is using her own equipment and is established with the company so she has standards to uphold.   My only complaint that keeps that 5th star away is that Floyd's only offers same-day hair appointments. I really prefer to make appointments in advance.
5 I go to the location in Chandler,AZ and Denver,CO both are the best they are very nice and always do a good job!
4 I liked the whole theme of the place.  I got a great cut on my hair but the lady kind of botched my bangs :/ it is a cool place though.
4 Caveat: I didn't get my hair cut here.  I was with my buddy who was getting ready for his wedding and the people at Floyd's were helping him get all gussied up.  But I would definitely get my hair cut here.  The stylists were all really friendly.  The decor and music selection was awesome.  I wish it was closer to where I live.
5 I am a creature of habit. At least when it comes to things of quality. I had the same person cut my hair for 3 years in high school, and another for 5 years in the Marines.   Having said that, I have found my new barber. Valerie is phenomenal! This is the second time I've gotten a cut and beard trim by her and she's just the bees knees.   All of the people I've gotten cuts from here have been good, but if you're looking for a super awesome stylist with mad nerd cred, seek no one other than Valerie.   The decor is neat, and the music is good; but what truly makes this place a winner are the people that man (well, woman) the front counter, and the incredible people that make up the stylist part of the staff.   Again, Book with Valerie and I can promise the experience will rock your socks off.
4 I've been getting my hair trimmed at Floyd's for awhile now after being introduced to the place by my husband. I like that I don't have to make an appointment - walk-ins are welcome and with my busy schedule, that is a plus.  Over all these visits, I've never found The Stylist that I want to see exclusively until yesterday. After my hair received Jenna's TLC, it looks fabulous, sassy, and super healthy. I'm going to start making appointments with her from now on.
3 Do not let the girl with the short blonde pixie cut take scissors to your hair. She is not very good.  Maybe she was having a bad day, but the trim I went in for is less than mediocre.  She also cut my bangs super crooked.  Thank god for bobby pins! Pinning my bangs back until they grow a bit.  She was nice.....but she needs to take more lessons to perfect her craft.
4 Four stars because I "almost" always leave with a great cut and a solid experience. Jenna cut my hair tonight and she did a killer job, didn't talk more than I wanted her to, firm shampoo, shaved my neck and then gave me a quick back/neck massage, which was enough. I tried a shave once Nd found that it wasn't closer than a regular shave, but the experience was incredible. Extremely relaxing, more so than some actual massages I've had.
1 I walked into the barbershop with my boyfriend who requested Valarie. The emo receptionist gal explained it will be 45 minutes, she took his name and number.   We returned approximately 40 minutes later...so 5 minutes early for the appointment time, and were told it will now be at least 30 more minutes because Valarie had started another client; however the same receptionist said "you weren't here so we took someone else" then said "I called you" we confirmed she had the correct number and there was no missed phone calls...This is POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!    I have been in the salon industry almost 20 years and I would NEVER treat a customer like this.  No apology,  just lie to my face because the receptionist thought she could squeeze someone in and there were other stylist available....not acceptable!  We left and my boyfriend was pissed and will not return.
3 Prices went up! Floyd's cut is no longer $21 now $22 and now the shampoo is extra $3. $25 for just a haircut. Kinda pricey. I need to find a barber that's charges only $16 for a haircut
5 Gena, Chris and Valerie have some wicked talent.  I drive 38 miles one way to come to Floyd's 99... Amazing experience!
1 I would put zero stars if that was an option.  The girl cut my hair in 5 minutes, cut it too short and did not make an attempt to make anything better.  The only thing she said was "I'll help you to the register to checkout".  It felt like she was racing to get me out of the chair.  I would never recommend this place to anyone.  This is far from a barber shop.    2nd worst haircut I have ever received.  At least the worst haircut was free.  The individuals that are rating 4/5 stars must be family or close friends.
5 My boyfriend drove by Floyd ' s one day and saw Jason. Since then he hasn't gone anywhere else.  Jason is great and always does a fantastic job.  Everyone there is always nice - service is great.
