3 This is the local Sobeys near where I live.  The location is great for convenience and there is certainly ample parking available.  The store is clean and well laid out, and there are times where I will take a quick run in to buy an on-sale item.  I do also love the seafood department here, there is good selection and quality, especially compared to the discount supermarkets.  However, Sobey's really misses here on the pricing.  The meat prices here are often a good 25% higher than the comparable stores, sometimes even more.  Frankly there are higher prices on almost everything in the store, and when you can go down the road to Freshco and purchase the same items for less, it makes me less likely to shop there.  Which leads to the next issue: this store is smaller than some of the other Sobeys stores in the area (the Ira Needles one that is about 10 minutes away) and as a result the selection and quantity of items suffers.  It's not unusual if there are sale items for this store to run out faster that other Sobeys stores in the area.  Overall, it's not a bad store, I just wish that it would be better, it would save me the drive to shop elsewhere.
5 The pharmacy at this location is superb.  The staff is very friendly and knowledgable.  The staff always answer questions with a smile.
