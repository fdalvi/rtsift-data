4 Very fond memories of this place  years ago.  Nothing like sharing the carne asada fries with my honey.  Oh, how I will cherish those.
3 I frequent this Roberto's, as it is convenient and the service is always good.They take phone orders, which only adds to the convenience. I wouldn't rate the food as excellent, but it is good and always fresh. A small salsa bar with fresh carrots awaits you and has always been fully stocked during my visits. They have fountain soda, which I prefer over bottles, along with horchata and other Mexican drinks. They have managed to stay in business in a shopping center that lost it anchor a few years back, so they must be doing something right. I would rate the food as on par with other Roberto's in town, but this one gets an edge for their customer service.
4 A bit small inside. Bathrooms are clean and food is always great. The boy at the register is nice. There are Roberto's all over town but I prefer this one because of the cleanliness and food consistency.
