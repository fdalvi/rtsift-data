5 Love this place, its quick and easy.  You do have to spend a little bit more money but it beats standing in line at the DMV!!!
5 Never again will I go to the DMV. If you want to be treated like a human being while getting title work done this the way to go. Well worth the few extra bucks. Nice people to business with!
5 Great fast service. No lines. In and out quick. Convenient. I will be back.
3 My purpose here was simple.  I had to return the license plate from our totaled vehicle in order to get the refund on the registration of the vehicle.  The refund is not handled here, they are just an authorized location to return the plate.  The guy behind the counter was very friendly, took the plate, and that was it.  Now that I know this place is here, however, I can foresee coming here to handle some DMV related things instead of going way out of my way to one of the DMV offices and sitting around for 1/2 an hour (or more) waiting for my number to be called.
