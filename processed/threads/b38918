3 I come to this Starbucks about once a week, and it's very good "A-OK"!  My normal Barista is Rhonda, who is a Target employee.  But you would never know it by her professional and friendly service.  Since the closing of the Starbucks up by the 101 and FLW, this has become the go to place for young parents in the mornings.    That said, the line is never more than three deep and the wait time is short.  They do not have a newspaper stand, so bring your own. LOL
3 What can you say about a Starbucks inside a Target? It's basically the same as any other Starbucks, but smaller. What I noticed when I walked up was that all the pastry items were wrapped in saran wrap and didn't look fresh. The barista was nice and had some samples (lemon cake) available. He was quick to take and make my order. It tasted like it would at any other Starbucks, so that was nice. I came here out of convenience and that was really the best part - no wait, quick to have my drink, and be on my way. I'd do it again, if the craving struck.
1 Either your coffee is so bitter you can't even drink it, or it's watered down. I've had the pleasure of having a coffee that was both-- very interesting combination! It was so terrible that I felt like crying; mostly because I spent $3.20 on it.
4 It's another starbuck but small and inside a target. there is usually only one person working so service is slowish but whoever is behind the counter is always friendly. the real plus to this location is they still serve the old starbucks baked goods, like from before they switched to the baby pink "la bolange" junk! including seasonal treats like the pumpkin cream cheese muffin. that's a huge plus.
