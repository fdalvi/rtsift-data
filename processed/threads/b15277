5 I am always happy when I walk out of an Ace Hardware and this trip was no exception.  I parked 50 feet from the front door, walked into the store and was immediately greeted by a friendly greeter asking me what I looking for. "Plastic glue", I replied.  "Aisle 10, half way down on the right." So I start walking toward aisle 10, I hear the greeter over his walkie-talkie-ear-piece-thinggy say, "got a customer coming down 10 looking for plastic glue." As I walked over to, aisle 10 I could see an Ace associate at the other end walking toward me and eventually meeting me right in front of the plastic glue section. "Hi there, can I help you find some glue?", he asked. "I'm looking for the strongest glue you have to bind the types of plastic used in [xx.classified.xx]?" He immediately recommended the brand Plastic Surgery and explained why it was a good product for my specific application. I read the package quickly, smiled, said, "thanks a lot!", headed toward the register, paid, walked 50ft to my car and was on with my day.  I paid a fair price and received the highest level of customer service.  Ace never disappoints. Total time from getting out of car to getting back in, under 5 minutes.  It takes half that time to get from your parking space to the front door of a Home Depot or Lowe's.  Five stars, no question.
2 When trying to find unique hard to locate products, this is a good solution.
5 The very best in customer service. There has been someone there to help me as soon as I walk in the door. The staff knows their stuff and I will be supporting this locally owned business instead of the box stores for sure.
