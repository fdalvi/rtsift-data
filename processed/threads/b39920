4 There are no toilets in here!!  This is one of the first things that struck me about this Next. It's huge, yet there are no toilets. I would have thought there would be toilets.  Next clothes sort of guarantee quality though, the years of perseverance has taught us that, if anything. As I've said about other Next's, the potential is there but it's just lacking that va va voom...the x factor......that special thing. It's getting there though.
3 Like Stephanie, I'm not really a fan of Next clothing but my friend shops here a lot and always has the most gorgeous tops and dresses. For me, I just find Next a little bit stressful to browse as it always seems like there's just too many clothes with only a few pretty items in amongst a tonne of bad eggs.  Located on Princes Street, this Next branch is always busy and has a huge selection to choose from. The last time I was in was with a friend who was looking for a new mirror for her room. After browsing the home ware department for what felt like an eternity she found a gorgeous, free standing full length mirror that was priced at a reasonable Â£45. It looks great in her room but I'll never forget helping her carry it home, it's funny now but I don't recommend trying to weave a huge mirror in and out of all the punters on Princes Street.  On that same occasion I topped up on some gift wrap and they had a 4 for 3 offer and a lovely selection of pretty wrapping to choose from.
