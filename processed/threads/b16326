5 Thanks for all the good tips and referrals. Thanks for taking the time to make suggestions and to look for alternate sizes in swim suits. I came in here with my husband and we did a little bit of swim suit shopping with our daughter. She's a mere 10 years old but we were dire need of a swim suit. Typically, I'd NEVER think to suggest buying a suit at the Playboy store...for obvious reasons. I didn't want to put her into anything tiny or overly skimpy. So, I was a bit skeptical when we came in here with the thought of buying a suit for her. Anyways, the associate was super awesome. She took the time to help us find something appropriate, or as appropriate as could be for a 10 year old. With everything on sale, and my loving the bunny logo, we were able to leave there with a simple suit for only $21, valued at $87. On top of that, the associate gave us a listing of a lot of the other lil local spots to do some shopping for inexpensive attire of all kinds. Thanks for your help. Even better, EVERYTHING was on sale! Too cool. Thanks for everything.
3 Went here around halloweentime last year and out of all my years going to vegas, this was the first time I entered. And now I see why. All that are here are (obviously) the logo'd out everythings and a lot of costumes. It wasn't even like an "adult" store, which I was hoping it would be. But I understand that the popularity of the playboy brand has spread to the adolescents, so this store can't be too rated R. I guess all the people who want to purchase souveneiry logo'd out stuff come here, or simply just the tourists who go "OOOO! PLAHY-BOOOY!". Figures... but to each their own.
5 You just have to love the bunny logo on your polo, short and tee and just flaunt it around. This store is not that big compared to the other designer stores but reminds me of a boutique store you'd find in LA.
