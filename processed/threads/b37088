5 I was so excited to find this shop the last time we visited Madison. What a great selection of artisan cheeses! The prices are so reasonable compared to what we would pay in Chicago. Plus the service was really friendly and helpful. They didn't mind when we ordered a quarter pound of this and a quarter pound of that. We will definitely return each time we visit our relatives and friends.
4 Adorable little cheese shop! The lady was incredibly sweet and extremely accommodating. Not to mention the cheese was delicious! Definitely a must see in Verona!
5 What a nice place to visit! The habanero havarti was soooo good. The lady working was so sweet, she even let me attempt to charge my dying cellphone on her dock. Her husband makes some of the cheese there and it is delicious! Go support this little shop!
