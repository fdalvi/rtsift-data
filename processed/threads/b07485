4 I WILL BE BACK!! The vibe was great. There was just something about this place that jived well with me.  There's an entrance in the front & back. Keep in mind that I used the front.  Karaoke 7 days a week. They have a HUGE book. The regulars mostly sing country. At about 11 a younger more rock style crowd might come in.  Wooden dance floor up front.  2 pool tables on the right. There are also darts of course.  You can sit all the way around the square shaped bar. I love the big tv's above the bar.  There are mirrors everywhere.  The bartenders introduce themselves & are the most friendly I've come across yet. Great bartenders, great crowd.  The drinks are strong :D Kudo's! Ask Brianna (spelling?) for a "piece of ass". Can't remember what was in it but it got me drunk. There are 4 beers on tap, but you get a frozen glass with bottled beer.  Restroom seemed clean enough. It smelled good as least. The lighting is only above the 2 stalls. No touch ups for the ladies going on here.  5 drinks between 2 people came out to about $25.
4 Dropped by for a quick drink on St. Patty's. Heather was working.  They had FREE stew & rolls. Yum!  Daren C asked me about their steak fry on Monday's, which I didn't know about. I asked about that while there & it's totally true. Might have to check that out some time...  Found out their karaoke doesn't start till 9.  The light over the sink was on this time. Had a girlie touch up moment.  Hadn't wandered over to the pool tables last time but there is a shuffleboard table along the wall too.
5 They hired a new bartender. It was his first night on Sat. If I remember correctly I think his name is David. Gosh, I'm probably totally wrong though.  Anyway, he's tended at a couple different places. He made 1 damn good Jamaican 10 Speed. I dislike Malibu so I asked for Parrot Bay. Delicious. I hope he sticks around for a while.  There was a late last call on Sat too. They were still serving right up till 2. They pretty much called last call at 1:50. So I think we got out of there around 2:15.  Oh, & I finally spotted the juke box. I've walked right past it quite a few times. I think when I look around for the juke box I picture the ones from the 50-70's or so. I'm looking for big, tall, brightly lit, & maybe orange or yellow colored. I'm so spastic sometimes lol  Restroom light was on again too :)  Come any day of the week. It's always fun here.
3 I guess if a rowdy place on the 17 is your place, then you'd like this one.  I was here for a gig ( a lot of my reviews seem to have that in them. What can I say? I'm pretty funny.) They have several TVs for your football needs. I was here on a Monday night and the crowd was pretty attentive to us comedians. A lot of support from the venue helped with that. Though I didn't get it, they have a pretty cheap steak dinner. It definitely smelled good!  Bartenders were attentive and friendly. They remembered my drink throughout the evening. Oh, and if you see a guy there who looks like Snoop's chubby, poor cousin, do NOT make eye contact. Guy waited for me outside the bathroom door! Creepy, but luckily I had comics there to save me.
4 Really not a bad place at all.  Live music on Friday and Saturday nights. I heard a band called "Geo" that played exactly what the crowd needed to hear:  A combination of funk, soul, country, salsa and cumbias. It's a nice, varied clientele, in other words.  Drinks are cheap and the wings are not bad.  I paid a $3 cover and didn't mind it at all.
3 Popped in for a quick drink yesterday on our way to buy food for the pooches. Prices on par for a dive bar. It's hard to mess up a bottle of bud and a whisky/coke - and it was really slow while we were there - so I can't comment after one visit on the skill of the bartender(s).  I saw a banner advertising Roscoe and Tim on Monday nights. That makes me flash back to my days at Chez Nous. And I think I may have to stop in sometime just for the auditory flashbacks! Funny thing about this town - 15 years later, and some things just don't change!  I don't know that I'd add Bullocks to my regular drinking rotation - but will definitely keep it on the list for a place to drop in for a cocktail or two.
5 try the wings, ask for honey bbq! they are the best
