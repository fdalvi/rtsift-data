5 Any conceivable spice you may need is probably at Penzey's.  In what could be an overwhelming experience, Penzey's lays out its retail store in simple terms--salads, baking, soups, pepper, etc.  Each spice is available in a variety of sizes, allowing you to try new items without committing to a huge jar.  Descriptions and samples of each spice let you "smell before you buy" and suggested recipes are posted for taking home.  Gift boxes of spices are available--I'd never considered giving spices as gifts before, but Penzey's makes it seem...right.
5 Penzey's is great. I get all my spices there when I can afford it.
2 We're extremely huge fans of Penzey's spices.  Prior to returning home to Wisconsin, I made countless trips to the "main store" in Brookfield, placed dozens of online orders, and have made road trips to Kansas City all in the name of procuring Penzey's spices.  They really are that good.  But this store in Middleton is a major disappointment for two primary reasons: the hours of operation, and the service.  The hours are a bit ridiculous... they close at 5:30pm on weekdays, and an unbelievable 5:00pm on Saturdays and 4:00pm on Sundays.  Really??  I don't know about you, but rarely am I finished shopping by 5:00pm on a Saturday... those days are usually so filled with activities that I'm doing my best to get everything finished by 9:00pm.  There's nothing more frustrating than driving over to a store with the intention of "running in to grab" (something) only to discover they've closed at a crazy-early hour.  Can someone share with me why the Penzey's stores close so early?    Second complaint: the service.  Customer service at most Penzey's stores isn't fantastic, but at this particular location, the store clerk was literally sitting on the counter, listening to the Brewers game on her radio, and seemed to be genuinely upset that we were buying $40 worth of spices from her.  The transaction went something like this:  Me: "Hi."  Her: "Hi." (rings up spices)  "$38.12"  Me: "Ok, here you go" (hands her debit card)  Her: "Want your receipt?"  Me: "Yes please, thanks."  That's it.  Not a "thanks" or a "you're welcome" or anything like that.  Not even a casual observation on the spices we purchased... just a "why are you bothering me?" attitude.    I guess I'll order online, even though this store is literally a mile from my place... :-(  I'd give this place zero stars if possible, but the spices are good; their Tellicherry Peppercorns are amazing, as are their Chili, Taco, and Fajita seasonings.  Also, be sure to try the Foxpoint Seasoning the next time you make potatoes - it's great stuff.  Just wish the service didn't absolutely stink.
5 Pricey, but the quality and variety of the spices are amazing!
4 We spend way too much money here but we do get some great spices that are ohhh sooo fresh.  Great selection and they also expanded their store too.    The staff could be nicer and more helpful. How about a free jar of something for my 100 dollar purchase?  That would be nice.
4 Penzey's is a great place for high quality spices. They have some off the off the beaten path items that are hard to find, fun blends, and your everyday basics.   Note to the budget wise, it is a WAYYYY better deal to buy the bigger bags, and buy the jars separate for spices you'll use frequently. That's what we do, and I stash the overflow in the freezer.   Some of my faves are the bay leaves, vanilla beans, and the nutmegs.
4 We recently discovered Penzey's spices for ourselves. I've heard about them for years and finally decided our massive assortment of very cheap low quality spices needed to go. I placed a mail order a couple of weeks ago with Penzey's and was able to throw out most of my old (some "best used by" dates were 5 yrs ago) spices. We quickly became big fans of Penzey's after sampling a few and enjoying the aromas of the rest.   A couple of days ago, I found out that Penzey's has this store right in Madison only about a 30 min drive away. We were very excited to go and visit asap. I figured it would be much easier to choose purchases in person since they have samples to smell, instead of relying solely on a written catalog description. I read some of the reviews here at Yelp, and was surprised that several people had pretty strong complaints regarding the lack of customer service at this location. This sounded very strange to me given Penzey's reputation for quality. You'd expect them to be proud of their quality and selection which you'd expect would translate to an enthusiastic, knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful staff. I didn't particularly care about the customer service since I was excited they had a store so close, and I'd be able experience all they had too offer....in person.   Yesterday (Sat. early afternoon) we were finally able to visit. To my surprise, they had about 5 people working there. I was almost disappointed as I kind of expected only one really uninterested employee half-sleeping at the register. We found their selection quite amazing, even a bit overwhelming. It's a very nice store with sample available to smell of almost every spice, herb, and mix that they carry. It was quite an interesting experience. The worst thing about the place is trying to limit your purchases so you don't buy every other item they sell. As we were choosing our selections it was apparent that all the employees were very busy helping the various customers. I spied in on a couple of conversations and it sounded like the employees were very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful to the customers. I didn't really have any questions, so I didn't interact with anyone except at the register. Although no one was there when I approached, a man quickly entered from the other side and asked if I was ready to check out. He was very friendly and quickly sent me on my way with my 10 bottles and $50 lighter wallet.   All in all, it was a good experience. I highly recommend Penzey's spices and would suggest you mail order if you must, but visit a store if you can.
4 They had everything I needed! The staff was friendly, available and helpful.  One of my favorite parts of the store is that all the ingredients have around one paragraph of description on them, including items like the origin of the ingredient and possible uses. I'm always afraid that I'm going to buy the wrong type of chili pepper (which is ridiculous because I would never in a million years be able to tell, I eat so few), but Penzey's descriptions helped me pick one that was appropriate for my dish (I picked an Indian pepper for my vindaloo).  I'll be returning soon, and likely many times after that.
4 I hate confusing Penzey's and the Spice House, but they're both great quality (and the same origin) with very typical friendly service.  Fresh, locally owned, with great blends and some pretty good original styles.  It's pricier than McCormick's out of the Copp's aisle, but it's supposed to be...you're not buying crap.  Support (quality) local!
4 Walk into Penzey's and tell me you don't walk out with the inspiration to cook or bake something.   I will admit that I don't go here EVERY time that I am in need of spices, but if I had unlimited funds I definitely would.  Everything here is great quality and they have such a huge selection! Yes, they are generally more expensive than the spices you'd find at a grocery store, but they come in nice refillable containers and they just seem nicer and fancier to use and they have a much larger variety that I normally see at grocery stores.    Penzey's spices make a great gift as well! they have pre-made boxes of spices, or you can create your own, OR you can get a gift card.  We got a gift card for our wedding and it was one of our favorite gifts, definitely a good motivation to get cooking!
3 Penzey's offers some unique spice and herb blends that you can't find anywhere else in town (at least not that I'm aware of). Staff are very helpful and provide great recommendations and advice.   One downfall is that Penzey's does not offer bulk spices like other spice shops. They also do not offer many, if any, rare or extra special spices or blends, such as truffle sea salt. Overall, a nice place to obtain things like curry powder and other unique blends.
5 The quality of spices available at Penzey's is second-to-none. I won't cook or bake with anything else; once you try them, you won't go back. And vanilla sugar for your coffee? Heaven!  The service at this store is very friendly and helpful. Often employees will make recommendations to try recipes featured on tear-off sheets in the store. This is NOT a store for fancypants gourmets; it is a store for people to love to cook (bake) for the people they love, which I would hope would be just about everyone!
4 One of my favorite places to get spices in town, and though many thing they're a fancy-pantsed place for foodies, their prices are quite competitive with most everywhere else in town (including spices at Copps, Target, and what have you.)  The staff is incredibly attentive and helpful when asked, and it's great that I was able to find out, with very little fuss, that EVERYTHING in the store, except for a couple of the soup bases, are made in a dedicated gluten-free facility.   (The soup bases all come from a separate facility, and some contain gluten.)  Overall, great quality, huge selection, and friendly, knowledgeable staff. Highly recommended.
