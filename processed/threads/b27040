4 Walgreens is not only the pharmacy of my choice but a great place for me to pick up little things like razors, face wash etc.... Without having to deal with big box stores like Albertsons or Smiths. Overall, their staff is very friendly and their pharmacists are to!
5 Walgreen's is brilliant. I scanned my prescription for refill this morning using their iphone app and just received an email to say it's done all in the space of one hour. Brilliant customer service :)
4 Not the usual Walgreens we use for our perscription needs but was in the area and decided to drop off and wait for my perscription.  The lady at the counter was helpful and my meds were ready in less than 15 minutes.  Also was able to get a free 2 liter of soda because they forgot to ask if I needed my flu shot.
4 standard walgreens, employees are nice and helpful at this location.
5 I love this walgreens. The staff are always friendly and accommodating. The pharmacist personally took care of a glitch in my prescription for me and had my prescription ready for me the same day a correction was made to it.  Love this store!!
5 My dog just had surrey so needed a hot compress.  Went to the pharmacy to ask which one they recommended and Dr. Roesenthal came out and picked it for me and even double checked for the right size.  Excellent customer service especially for such a busy guy.  I strongly recommend this drug store.
2 I still haven't set up my computer and printer at home so I need to scan a couple photo to email a friend and their photo center is not capable to do so. That's was a bummer
