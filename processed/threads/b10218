1 It took TWO months, 20+ phone calls and 20+ emails and I finally got my shoes which had glue all over them.  NOT HAPPY  If you can buy the shoes in-store...good for you but don't expect anything better than CRAP if you need to place an order with their factory.  Carlos, the owner is cute and charming but has terrible business sense and lack of honesty.  Go somewhere else!
4 Just returned home with a pair of awesome boots sold to  me by Carlos.  With his broken english he was a gentlemen of a salesmen and happy to have my boyfriend and I there shopping for a pair of hot boots for me.  He has had the store for 12 years!  It is quiet and small and maybe a little dusty but he was such a pleasure.  Great to have quality European apparel here in the states.  We will be back.  Thanks Carlos.
