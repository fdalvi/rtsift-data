5 I got a great deep tissue massage here with Nick the massage therapist. So good that I conked out for two hours when I got home! It's a fairly new business with just Nick by himself, and you can tell he's really passionate about what he does. The business is really centrally located and the opening hours make it really easy for anyone to avail of a massage. He does Swedish deep tissue, and Swedish relaxation massages. I decided on the deep tissue which was £25 for one hour! Bargain! or you can buy three for £60. An even better deal! I've already been back and I'm going again.
5 I was traveling throughout Europe and was in Edinburgh. I must have slept wrong or tweaked my back somehow, and I had so much pain in my mid-lower back.  It hurt just to take a breath! I found Nick through Yelp and made an appointment. As an American, massage is a part of holistic medicine to keep you healthy and is widely utilized in the States. Nick is committed to his role as, in my opinion, a health care provider and is extremely knowledgeable on all things musculoskeletal. He identified the issue through asking me questions and then assessing the muscle group.  Nick found that I had a problem with a set of muscles around my 12th rib on my right side of my back and he worked on those muscles for the hour.  Thank goodness I went to Nick to help me because I slept a million times better that night and felt pretty damn good the next day.  Thank you for helping me Nick!!!!!
