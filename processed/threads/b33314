1 I purchased a Living Social voucher for Word of Mouth house cleaning- 4 hours for $50.  This seemed like a great deal to use leading up to having guests over for the holidays.  The only catch is that you have to figure out a way to contact them.  They don't answer the phone in the morning, afternoon, or evening.  They don't respond to e-mails.  The voice mail is typically full, but I was able to leave a message one day.  This leads me to believe that someone had been there to empty the previous messages.  Well, my voice message was not returned either.    I don't know what else I can do or say about this one.  I complained to Living Social about the business and received a LS credit.  I could not recommend this company to anyone else, since at this point it's still up in the air whether they even exist.
1 You are not alone! I just got my refund from LivingSocial on this. I have left SEVERAL messages and contacted them via thier website. The only WORD OF MOUTH I will be doing is NOT to use them...not like you can anyway, no one returns calls!
1 I also bought a Dealfind deal for $39 for "4 hours of professional house cleaning" and have had the same experience - called, couldn't leave a message because v-mail was full, emailed through their website with no response, called and left a message with no response. Getting a Dealfind credit today. STAY AWAY!!!
1 Scam, scam, scam!  If it's too good to be true, there's a reason- this company will take your money and run.  Don't do it.  No matter how desperate you are to have your house cleaned.  Spend the money on supplies and do it yourself!
