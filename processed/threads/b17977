3 3 Stars for Shoes.  I absolutely freaking hate Ross for clothes. I have no patience to wade through racks of polyester crap to find hidden gems. Their bags are abominations (jeebus, I saw a purse that had brass knuckles as the handles) and their home selection freaks me out (who buys discount chocolate truffles?).   But, amazingly I can handle their shoe department. I have huge clown feet. Size 10 baby. For a very long time, I owned literally like 3 pairs of shoes. I'd just wear them out and replace them with either the same shoe or a variation on it. I longed to be the girl with the expansive shoe collection. But alas, my ski feet prevented it and I couldn't stomach spending my hard earned money on shoes when there were other things I could buy. On an off day, I walked into Ross.   I hightailed it over to the shoe department expecting to see Aerosoles cast-offs and Naturalizer rejects, possibly something orthopedic. Instead I saw Nine West, BCBG and Steve Madden. Etienne Aigner also made a cameo. I was suspicious still. I was sure the discount would be like $5 off retail. Oh was I wrong, they were like $25. It was a glorious moment. I'm sure a light shone down from heaven and birds sang. That could have also possibly the flourescent lights shorting out and a weird old lady cackling though.
3 If you really look you can find nice clothes, but most of the stuff is cheap and shrinks the wrong way in the wash. I like coming here just because I know everything's going to be cheap anyway.  I love the panties and bras. So many to choose from, and most of them are fun (or funny). Lots of cute shoes, too. Purses...meh. I've probably bought 1 or 2 purses here, but I don't usually check because I haven't seen anything to my liking too many times.
3 On the way to meet a friend for dinner The Better Half decided that she needed some hair accessory or something like that.....so we made a quick stop here to pick it up.  Normally, the lines are pretty long at a Ross, but for some reason this place was empty.  I told her to hurry up before the line got long as the cashiers at Ross are notoriously slow.  Luckily, we were in/out of there in less than 5 minutes.  Return Factor - 60%
4 Good selection of finer quality items. This particular location gets a nice inventory in, unless I happen to just be lucky enough to go at the best times of the day! I really enjoy the hunt sometimes, and I can't leave this store empty handed. I buy clothes as well as household and pet items here.
3 I had never been to this specific Ross before and was pleasantly surprised when I stopped by this weekend. I wanted to grab some candles (I'm suddenly addicted) and they had a rather large selection. All sorts of sizes and smells, it was fun to pick and choose. The entire store is rather large and easy to navigate. I didn't do much browsing, but this Ross seems to have way more stuff than a few others I'd been to. Also, it was pretty clean. (Didn't go into the changing rooms though, which can be a real sign on cleanliness.) Overall, it wasn't a bad experience. I didn't have to wait long in line, which is definitely a plus! If I'm in the area again, I'd stop by.
