4 I came here recently to try to remember my dancing experiences at ASU.  They offer a great deal to start out with, for $25 you get 3 20 minute private lessons and 2 group lessons.  I signed up for 4 more classes however, at a much much higher rate. I highly recommend the starting deal as I feel I've gotten much out of that but overall price, I can't really afford many more classes!
4 I can't dance..yes I can!  Well tonight the hubby and I took our first dance lesson and what a hoot!  Had a blast.  The instructor's approach was clear and easy to follow.  She did a great job at blending focus on the instruction with keeping it fun and upbeat.  The facility is pleasant, immaculate and huge - and available to students for practice at any time, not just during their lessons. As mentioned in a previous review, they have a great deal for first time students.  The best thing for couples is that the price per lesson is the same whether for a single or a couple.   Because I've only done one lesson, and my first dance lesson every (well since high school, but the dinosaurs because extinct since then),  I'm looking forward to more lessons and the opportunity to add a star.
4 Fun, engaging classes that really help with form, rhythm, style. Helpful instructors, especially Andrew. Wonderful private lessons. Plenty of floor space.  conveniently located in the middle of everything.  Only complaint: Super Super high end so expect to pay designer prices.
