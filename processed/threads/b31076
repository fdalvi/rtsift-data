2 Just better than a wet cardboard box. Building inside electric door latch has not worked for 6 months, even after an electrical renovation of the storage building. Went to go in and no lighted digits to use the keypad so people stuck inside were stuck till the attendant came back from lunch. People outside could not get in. When it works this is usually a good place but it has had security and break in problems.Leak problems for stuff from the second floor. Cracks in bottom floor where ground water comes up.  I am there now but I would not recommend this site to other people.
1 So many hustles! You MUST by their lock, even though I have a perfectly good lock. You MUST pay for insurance, which they don't tell you until they've kept you there for 30 mins, printed up the contract ect. Poor business practices!
5 Barry is one of the best people I have met. He is always there and makes sure everything is taken care of. Prices are reasonable and the staff is obviously awesome! Never had any problem. As for some of the other reviews, the door locks in the front gate and to the other units work just fine.
4 Would be 5 stars if there was someone in the office all the time, but I've had to wait upwards to an hour for someone to assist me. Otherwise if you make your payments on time you shouldn't have any issues.
5 I always get Great service here with Barry.  I would recommend it to all of my friends!!! Thank you barry !!!
