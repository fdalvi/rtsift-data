5 So I was introduced to this station about 6 months ago by a fellow yelper who goes by Amy D... She has a wicked 8-10 spot on Tuesdays and I thoroughly enjoy listening to it on a weekly basis. Well, I was happened upon an opportunity... Nay! A priviledge of being a guest on this FABULOUS show and, being the attention whore that I have been labeled, I accepted.  I won't go into HOW I found myself being handed this prestigious title of KWSS Guest, but it involved a House of Clubs, Twitter, and a whole lot of begging (on my part)...  There I was... in the presence of 100% pure, raw (Can't decide which word to use "Talent" or "Creativity") and in a pretty bad ass studio. The Fabulous Amy and I discussed all the important topics of the nation/world and stumbled on numerous great ideas. One being a cure for cancer! Okay, we didn't discover a cure per say... but we did briefly talk about it.  The listeners were top notch and the atmosphere was professional, yet extremely comfortable. Plus, we actually got some free talent from a caller! He was awesome and sang me happy birthday.  It was sexy.  Thanks for a great time, Amy and KWSS! You rock, alternatively!
5 Best college radio station Phoenix never got and the closest we'll ever get to KXCI in Tucson. Italian-language specialty shows, Beatles show, Democracy Now and other public affairs programs on the weekends... TMI weekday mornings with Beef Vegan and Shorty... Dani's Diner at lunch playing 70's/80's stuff... musically, it's akin the old KUKQ (before it was a sports station) and even plays Jonathan L's show from Berlin. All the great indie stuff you can't/won't ever hear on X103.9 (what a joke), you'll hear it on KWSS-LP - and it is "LP" (Low Power), which means stronger reception in Glendale, North Phoenix, Scottsdale, Fountain Hills, weaker reception in the East Valley - so, you'll need to listen from a smart phone app if you live Mesa or Glendale.
5 This is the only station I listen to throughout the day. Beef Vegan is great. The music is eclectic. You can request your favs using the online bot, so blame yourself if the music ain't rockin' ya.  Dani's a goof, though...If I could give a 4.5 I would based on the tired old music Dani tends to throw up....but, I'd rather give the whole station the benefit of the doubt.
5 I'm listening.  New music and even great news in the early AM.  The morning show is good.  Thank you.  The Valley needed this.
