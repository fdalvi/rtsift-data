5 Absolutely love this place! The staff is patient and attentive and they have provided great results with both of my kids starting at different levels. Great baby swim classes and older child swim classes! Couldn't ask for anything better.
5 We love this swim school!  All the instructors are exceptional!  They are all so patient and are great about getting on the kid's level to explain what needs to be done.  I love that they focus on the fundamentals of swimming and teach proper technique.  They teach water safety and pool rules.  My 2 and 3 year old love the water now and are becoming great little swimmers!  We have taken the Express Swimming program, baby swim, group lessons, private lessons, and even used the Parent's Night Out.  I would recommend any of the programs.  We love them all!
3 Good place to start, though it gets quite noisy and crowded at times.  So far, I find this place to have very friendly staff that goes out of their way to accommodate you. The water temperatures are nice and warm and the pool is easy to get into and out of. The hours are fairly good as well.   I'd say the private lessons are really the way to go, as it gets quite crowded and the noise levels get high when there's a cluster of parents perched on the benches and the instructors have to shout to be heard above the splashing water. This can be disconcerting to a little person who might be uncomfortable about both water and crowds.   I'm going to attend a few more classes before deciding if the format works for our needs. It might be best for infants and kids slightly older who have some experience. I think it might be a matter of finding the right times for easing a child into swimming.
2 When I signed my son up for classes they told me over the phone $50 a month then after that month was over they jacked the price to $72 a month. He did the same thing in all 4 of his lessons he didn't learn anything.
