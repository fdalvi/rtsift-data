5 Went in to get my hair cut yesterday as my first time there. Service was excellent. I was very happy to see how clean everything was, as well as how friendly the staff was. This is the only salon I go to from now on!  Hair stylist: Michell.
5 LOVE this place. Larry does my hair as well as my husband's, daughter's and my mother's. Expert at the ombre and everything else under the sun. Highly recommend!
