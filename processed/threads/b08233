4 Good roast beef. The place can get crowded, but service is pretty fast when they're not.
5 A really a clean (maybe new?) Arby's.
4 Excellent roast beef, the Big max is the best. I asked for extra horsey sauce didn't get but 3. Then I realized the roast beef is delicious doesn't need none of of that. Fast drive thru even during high traffic times at noon
