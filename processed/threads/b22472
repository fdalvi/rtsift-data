4 ok.  went this weekend.  this place is GREAT.  Only reason it does not get 5 stars is because the bartenders changed their pricing for drinks according to who went up to get drinks and when.  For me I dont drink so i dont care, but my friends felt a little po'd...  Great place to dance. not too crowded. no cover.  great ambience.  I also love the cabanas.  great place to chill.  The black painted bathrooms are very chic.  You see some very fine dressed ladies here.  My head was constantly turning, and the ladies i came with were having a blast.  The outside wall with the movies playing on it, and the outside swing was real cool as well.  This could be a go to place.
5 This is a great place to hang out with friends and have some drinks. Great atmosphere and decorations. Much better than some of the other bars in old town Scottsdale where you are crowded into a small dark room with no where to sit or socialize.  Check it out!
2 No cover and outdoor misters. Decent crowd, overpriced drinks, teeny dance floor, good selection of d'bags to giggle at. It's A.) a club, B.) in a chain hotel, C.) in Scottsdale, fer chrissakes. What more could you ask for? My only hangup was how dark they keep it in there. People in Scottsdale are generally good looking, so a little more lighting in there isn't going to hurt business one bit.  Overall... this place doesn't feature anything that really stands out.
