5 Vitality Aqua Massage Ballys Las Vegas was a super value! The aqua massage and oxygen bar was excellent! I had a 4 hour drive home to phoenix from las vegas (after a looong weekend) and chose to visit here just before i left to help relax me and make my drive comfortable and i must say i felt great! Not even for the drive home but even the next day. I highly recommend. I further recommend the super nice girl from the ukraine, she was very friendly and easy to speak to which made the experience even better! She showed me all the options and devices they sold (and even tried them out on me while there) with absolutely no pressure to buy!  Great experience! A+++ ;-) shawn phoenix, az. dewrag1@yahoo.com
4 We needed a quick massage and we decided to try this.  $10 for 10 minutes. You lay down in the casket style bed with all your clothes on, take off shoes only, put your chin in the head rest and the water jets go up and down your body massaging you.  you can stop the jets if there is a certain place you want more massaging.  we enjoyed it and it was rather relaxing too even though people were walking by gawking at us.  I will try it again.
