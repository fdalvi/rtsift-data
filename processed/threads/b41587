5 My wife an I rented two scooters for three days and had a blast. This was way cheaper then a taxi. The customer service was excellent and they delivered on time and picked up from our hotel. Will be sure to call on out next trip. Thanks
5 Great way to see and explore the Las Vegas Strip. Me and 3 friends rented scooters had a great time.
5 Having a scooter to get around Vegas was a great highlight to my trip. Also, I had Soo much fun cruising the strip and got some amazing video of the casinos and my friends riding along. Thank you JAM Scooters!
