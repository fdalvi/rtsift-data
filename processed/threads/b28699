5 Derek did a family photo and it was such a pleasure working with him. He put us at ease and the pictures came out great. I have never liked my pictures but Derek was wonderful and was able to even make me look good.
5 Derek took the photos of our wedding and I was highly impressed. He has a great eye and is easy to work with. He is also extremely creative when it comes to different shots if you don't know exactly what you want. I highly recommend him.
5 Derek's photography is awesome!  I had the pleasure of having Derek photograph my birthday party, and I have to say he didn't miss an opportunity for a great shot, he took great pics that we'll treasure for a long...long time. If you want quality.... I highly recommend Derek's Photography.
5 Derek has the ability to bring out the passion of  life. His keen eye catches the emotion for the moment, a special occasion, or, that one-of-a-kind event.  In the dusk of dawn or inside the midnight hour. And best of all, his rates are affordable!
5 Derek captures each & every moment. His work is splendid. Derek took beautiful pictures at a event of mine.  When someone asks me if I know a photographer I always recommend Derek.
