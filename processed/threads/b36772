4 Cleopatra Nails is fairly new, so the place is very clean.  The nail techs are all very professional.  Prices are very reasonable and the fact that 8.00 for eyebrow waxing is their standard price.  Other salons in the area are 10-12 bucks.  Walk-ins welcome.  The pedicure spa chairs are all very nice, comfortable and new.  Nice touches as well, they offer water, soda or coffee from their Keurig machine.  Hot rock massages and neck massages are all part of the price for a pedicure.
1 Not worth it, slow and not very customer oriented.
4 This place is great. All the tools and foot spas appear to be clean. Ive never had any issues. I drive out of my way to go to this place. I can trust that they will do a great job every time!
5 What a great value!  You get a neck & shoulder massage with every pedi.  Friendly staff & clean salon.
4 Under new management but they did keep their prices the same.  You can still get the 8 dollar eyebrow wax, complimentary neck massage with every pedicure.
