1 We were looking for a nail salon that didn't break the bank on the Las Vegas strip.  Found from a Google search, this place seemed too good to be true.  It was!  It certainly is located on the strip, in the strip mall just a few steps down from Encore -so A+ for convenience.  However, LV Nail Salon is your typical nail place where you have Vietnamese people chatting with each other and asking you about your personal life while they are working on you.  The chairs I'll admit were pretty comfortable, but it smelled like onions in there and you got an overall unclean/unsanitary feeling.  The pedicure was 20 minutes AT MOST.  I ordered the "Deluxe" pedicure which was supposed to come with 15 minutes extra of massage time, but the service took the same amount of time as my friend who got the regular pedicure.  They only used one coat of color.  Their website describes a warm elixir towel wrap - what a hoax!  It was just a thin white dish towel that was probably soaked in luke warm water.  They also try to push more services on you, such as the eyebrow wax, multiple times while they stare disgustingly at your eyebrows.  I am happy with more than one line of hair as eyebrows, thank you.  In short, if you're looking to save money, get your nails done before getting to Vegas.  This place is highly NOT recommended.
2 despite the negative reviews, i went anyway. let me just say ive definitely had better. I really dont like my nails but since i was in dire need to get my broken nail fixed i guess this is better than nothing. plus there was no way i was spending $75+$12 to get a fill at the spa in my hotel.
1 This salon is horrible!   My wedding was the next day and I went hoping to get my feet and nails done. Well they wouldn't let me out without a facial too. All seemed well but afterwards I ended up with an 800 dollar bill for my nails, pedicure, facial, my mom's nails and pedi and the grooms nails, parrifin treatment and facial. While it seems like a lot, it was pretty expensive.   My main problem was not only did they leave the groom's face red but they promised to have me out of there by 6 because I was supposed to meet my family for dinner but it was almost 7 by the time they finished.   Later I went to have the nails taken off because my nails were hurting  and my nail salon told me they fused the nails to my skin! My nails couldn't grow! Now I know why it was painful.   I am not going back! Please be advised against this place as I think they are using unsafe practices.
1 I always regret not reading the yelp reviews on a business. If I could give negative stars I would. This place was the closest to my hotel room at the Marriott and they had an opening for immediate service, and I was happy to not have to deal with the strip traffic to get a brazilian. I had laser treatments so I didn't have very much hair, but wanted to be smooth for Vegas! This was the worst waxing service I've ever gotten. I usually get charged for a bikini because I don't have too much hair, but this place said they would give me a $5 discount. So whatever, i an usually charged $35 because i have such little hair, but I just wanted the service, so it would cost me $50 for the service, which is a fair price for a Brazilian. I'm not a fan of roller wax because they are hard to sanitize. They told me over the phone that they use satin smooth, so I was surprised when Diane applied the roller wax which is not the satin smooth brand. Got the wax on now, so I'm committed. Took her four small applications and she said I was done. No I wasn't, a Brazilian  means all the hair and she did not do my bottom. I asked Her to finish that part, and then I sensed she was a little annoyed. She touched up and then handed me a tissue to get the wax residue off. When I looked, there was so much hair left! I said there was still some hair, and she said oh she'll just tweeze it. Um it would have taken her 30 minutes to get all the stragglers. She plucked about five, and said ok you're done. Me with an appalled look said, no there is still a ton of hair! Her very annoyed now grabs the roller and reapplied the wax, which is a huge no no with strip wax, especially down there, she could have burned me or worse yet take skin. Ok wax was there and THANK GOD the wax did not take skin, just a slight burn. Again she gives me the tissue paper with the residue remover, and what does tissue do when it touches wax? Yes it sticks and balls up. I just wanted out of there, already regretting not going to a hotel spa to get my waxing done. On the way out, she tries to up sale me to do my nails, what nerve! I of course said no after that experience, and had to tell her no three times! I was trying hard to be polite being in the same industry. She then asked me what I do, I said I am an Esthetician. She said well why didn't you do it yourself? Well first of all, I'm not a contortionist, and second of all, I don't bring my wax with me on vacation. I contemplated to not leave a tip, but didn't want to be entirely rude. The owner, (who I assume was the old vietnamese guy in the earlier yelp post taking a nap), had the balls to say that's all your leaving for a tip? I just signed and left. I didn't want to be the jerk in the salon, but hopefully this post will save anyone from an awful experience.
1 Horrible service and dishonest pricing.  Details below if you need them. The only time I've left a salon without tipping... I should have paid more for the salon at our hotel! My mani and pedi were done together which would have been fine if the manicurist wasn't lazy and rude.  While I'm "relaxing" in a massage chair, the manicurist works only from one side of the chair so she is tugging my arm across my body to work on the opposite hand.  I had to sit sideways in the chair. Not relaxing.  She left my nails all different lengths, barely filing them and not cleaning them.  Didn't remove all of the prior nail color, leaving a dark circle around my nail beds showing through the newer, lighter color.  It wasn't a manicure, it was barely a polish change.  Instead of trying to sell me a gel polish, facial, hair cut and parafin dip, she should have been doing what I came for- a manicure! And not repeatedly insulting me for having dry, damaged cuticles (with attitude).  I would have ended with the parafin dip if I could have standed to have her in my space for any longer.  While my pedicure was finishing up, she sat in the chair next me on personal calls. My pedicure was also a polish change and not a pedicure.  She ran the buffer across my heel once! My boyfriend's pedicure was nice...but they took advantage.  He opted for the parafin and loved it.  He passed on the manicure they persistently pushed.  And when the pedicurist looks at him and says, "callus?" and he replies with a nod and says, "yes, I have calluses"  he was requesting a $10 callus treatment (which I was charged $15 for). At the register- First tried to charge me for the parafin I didn't have. My final total was $113?  $35 pedi + $35 pedi + $18 mani + $10 parafin + $10 callus = $108. Crooks.
2 Messy polish application. Had my toenails shaped perfect going in and now they are all crooked. Polish on my skin with a dark blue polish isn't cute. Skip this place.
1 Tools not clean! They don't sterilize any of their tools. They clip and cut you and don't even wash the tools. They just stick them back in the drawer. Everything else was ok. They rush through everything and are sloppy. Unfortunately it was the only place I could find near the strip that wasn't a pricey spa.
2 This salon did only an "okay" job.  I did a search on yelp before going and this seemed to be the best place that was also convenient.  I got the deluxe pedicure and gel nail manicure.  I liked the massage chair.  The fact the the chairs are arranged in a circular fashion gave me some sense of privacy (just a tad). The woman who did my pedi left heels soft, which was good.  They did not use a razor, which is good. However, it was a little awkward getting the mani at the same time by a different technician.  Polish wasn't perfect. I had a couple of bubbles on my big toes.  But at least no polish on my cuticles.  I wish I could save the same for my mani! Anyone who knows about gel polish knows getting the polish on the cuticle RUINS the nails! I had chips after 3 days!  The technicians just weren't careful enough. You HAVE to be a PERFECTIONIST to do gel nails right! However, they both gave good foot and hand/arm rubs.
3 Clean, quiet, walk-ins welcome. Friendly staff. Sure beats the outrageous prices at the hotel salons.
1 The most disappointing experience. If you'd like to be treated with non-sterile instruments by people who demonstrate you their disrespect and absence of qualification and professional knowledge - you are in a right place. Do not expect the owner (he's also the manager) to give you receipt.
1 ***Warning*** & ***pics***  visitors vacationing from out of town, do not come to this salon if you value your nails!  I thought I would avoid the high end pricey nail salon in the casino hotels along the strip and go to a local salon. Well, first thing I noticed was there weren't any local independently owned nail salons along the strip or conveniently within walking distance of the strip. So on our way to Fremont st (on the bus) we saw a huge nail salon sign and we got off immediately and thought we lucked out.  Well, my first impression of the surrounding neighborhood was YUCK! We were just outside the glitz and glamour of the strip (quite a ways from the Wynn which is basically the last casino hotel on the strip) and found ourselves smack dabbed in the damned ghetto. But I digress, we didn't let that stop us! I quite literally was desperate! We walk in and there's 2 people getting pedi's and like 8 employees sitting around (yeah, that was very telling to say the least). I asked for a gel french manicure and a french pedicure, the gel french mani is simply a thick tacky like (clear or selected colors) polish that is applied over your natural nails to strengthens and prevent your nails from breaking it's also supposed to last 2 weeks.  The girl who did my pedicure was fine, she did what was expected, nothing fancy. The girl who did my manicure however was absolutely HORRIBLE!!!!! OMG! I could have done a better job doing my own nails myself. I don't remember her name but she was non Asian, late 20's/early 30's, thick dark hair, bulbous nose. Anyway the first red flag for me was when she was to lazy to take the polish off my nails with nail polish remover to investigate what kind of gel finish I had underneath the polish. Instead she files the polish half way than in a very sloppy way slaps on way to much gel removal solution wrap my fingers in aluminum foil for a few mins and takes a scraping tool to scrap the gel as hard as she can killing my nail bed in the process talkin about, "oh sorry honey!" I'm thinking, "yeah you are sorry, that's a fact!"  Next thing I hear from her, "What the hell? Why isn't this coming off?" The girl doing my pedi said its the stronger type of gel (not the cheap crap they were using) so pedi girl says, "just file and shape it." In my head I'm going, "Great! I get to have the ghetto special." (Sarcastically of course) lol anyway long story short after spending $55 on the mani (way over priced for the their low class services) and $65 on the pedi and not at all happy with the the results of the Mani or how tight, gritty, and dry my hands where feeling.   The next morning after taking a shower I noticed the tips of my french gels started to peel (pics of this is posted above). My husband made a call so they would fix this sorry excuse of a manicure which it just so happened to be on my last night in Vegas. Having absolutely no shame and not sounding surprised at all about my nails basically disintegrating less than 24hrs after getting them done! they said absolutely and we close @ 8pm. Well when we made it by cab around 7pm and there was a white, blond haired woman standing out in front smoking a cigarette and had the nerve to tell us that even though they close @ 8pm she didn't have a technician there. The lights were off and no one was there But her old, tacky, rude, haggard a$$! I was livid to say the least!  All in all I'd say its absolutely worth paying the extra money to get your nails done right! bit the bullet and go to the nail spa at your hotel. I've certainly learned my lesson, that's for sure!
1 I went on a whim, because my boyfriend was coming to visit the next day. A few key points: 1. They don't wash their tools. They don't wash their tools. They used a dirty, grimy set of clippers on my toes, and some nasty kind of file on my nails. 2. The pedicurist was sloppy on the cutting of my nails, didn't treat my feet the same way; it was like she forgot how to do the pedicure on my left foot. She let the clippings just fall on the floor, dumped a lot of product on my feet and the floor.  3. The only reason the nail color came out okay is because I brought the color myself. 4. They did some weird kind of oil rub into my legs, and then hit me with a hot towel. 5. I'm a local, so they charged me $32 for the pedicure.   It wasn't pleasant at all. Not a lot of scrubbing on my feet. And I heard them tell a tourist next to me that her mani/pedi was $100. $100?!!?! What a scam. I never write reviews, but this place was terrible.  I should have known when I walked in and it was empty, and the attendants were watching movies on their ipads, that this isn't a good place. Read the reviews, and don't visit here! They will rip you off.
1 Ridiculous over priced ... They pretend don't understand English so you get whatever they "understand" you ..Warning ....they give you a price and when you are done they overcharge you !!!  Watch out
1 The most horrible nail experience I have ever had! Myself and a friend were completely desperate to have our infills done. The staff have no idea what they are doing and try to charge for every little addition. I have never heard of any salon trying to change an extra $5 to file my nails in addition to the $40 they are already charging for an infill treatment. My infill was done in less then 20 mins with no cuticle work. The girl who did my nails was extremely rude when I refused to agree to getting a new full set. To top it off one of nails has already lifted less then 24 hrs after having them done! Do not go to this salon!
1 the worst experience i have ever had in my life!!!!!!!! i should have read the warning!!! i walked out!!! rude and just horrible!!!
