4 for those who like dirt track racing, this is a place to go. it's a 3/8 mile oval clay dirt track that hosts the likes of imca modifieds, super stocks, pure stocks, sw modlites, bombers, dwarfs cars, sprints, late models.   after the races, go into the pits to meet the drivers and get an up close look at the cars. it's a good time hanging out.   they have concessions, souvenir stand, offer free overnight camping on race nights for self contained campers only, as no services are available.   there's something about the roar of the engines and the exhilaration of the race that keeps me going back.   check out the website, www.canyonspeedwaypark.com for schedule, entrance fees, directions, etc.   hope to see ya there!
5 Now you have to realize, I am a race fan. So all you need for me is a oval track and cars! I was very spoiled by living is socal! Irwindale is a top of the line race track in the nation. But after coming here last Saturday, I had a ball. First of all I was just happy to find a race track in the area. After living here for just lest than a year, I am just was estactic that this place even existed! Now you have to realize, this place looks like a track they put together as cheap as they can to offer their fans racing. And that OK with me. Safety fence is basically just a chain link fence, so I do worry about that. But you are up close and see all of the action through out. I do have a problem with all of the smoking going on in the stands. Especially when smokers do not care about the little ones around. But other than that I will become a regular!
