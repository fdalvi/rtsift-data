4 Dune is the sort of place that can be brilliant or can be awful. Sometimes I go in here and think 'who the hell would pay £95 for a pair of pumps that will be ruined in the rain?' . Well, my mum - that's who.  You can't deny that they have lovely shoes and brilliant styles, and the quality is very good. Ok ok, I might have exaggerated just a tad - their pumps don't get ruined in the rain. But I always frown at expensive pumps.  Their heels are lovely, really good quality and really different. Their boots are particularly good, I have a lovely pair of brown patent over-the-knee that I always get compliments on. Cost me an arm and a leg though, but it's worth it if you know you'll get the good of them.  Also, if you're in this branch ask for Krystal. And tell her I say hello!
3 I can't resist shoes, I really can't, I could take or leave handbags/belts and any other accessories but shoes really are my weakness. The shoes in Dune are no exception, they always have gorgeous shoes in styles to suit many different tastes. A few years ago I got gorgeous little yellow ballet pumps, they were so cute and comfy that I just had to go back to buy them in black and pink too.  The crème de la crème of Dune shoes are their fancy stilettos, they always have them gorgeous styles with beautiful decoration that could really rival designer shoes but for a fraction of the price.  Unfortunately Dune only gets three stars because their sizes are really bad. I'm always moaning about my small feet but I can fit into size 3's in pretty much every shoe shop apart from Dune they're always far too big. Occasionally I can't resist and have a few gorgeous Dune shoes but every time I wear them I have to put about three pairs of insoles in too. Sort it out Dune! *Sigh*.
