5 They are stellar at what they do, and that is keeping you safe. Highly recommend.
2 I was impressed at first. I left a message to schedule an apt and was contacted immediately. The gentleman who came to view my property and discuss my security needs was prompt, helpful and informative. He told me to expect an estimate within a week. And that is where my positive experience ended. It has now been over two weeks and a few email inquiries later and no response. I guess they don't want my business? Regardless I am unimpressed and sorry that they wasted my time.
5 The ICU group did a thorough review of my property and security needs and provided fast service. One of the owners, Bill Wilm, was especially helpful and even followed up to insure we were totally satisfied. A first class company!
