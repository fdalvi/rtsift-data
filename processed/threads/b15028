4 I really dig this store! great shoes, boots and shades.... every pair of shoes I've bought here fits like a glove and looks great.... cashiers are usually hotties too!
2 No way am I coming back here! The shoes seem to be made poorly, but I haven't actually kept a pair of shoes and I never will because I'm never coming back. I bought one pair because I thought they were cute, but quickly changed my mind so I returned them. Do you know how many people asked my WHY I'm returning them? In a very rude manner, literally all the people who were working there. Not only did it make me uncomfortable but they lost a customer because of it as well.
1 Had to wait to be checked out, while one staff member was not doing anything, except staring at me with a gaping mouth. Not worth wasting your time.
2 Was doing a little shopping had to pick a few items up in the store the gentleman working tall dark haired gentleman wasn't very friendly low on personality I felt that I was inconveniencing him for being not sure if I'll be back to this location if I see him again but I do stop in there periodically but maybe, maybe he was just having a bad day from the holidays there was only two people me being number three slot wasn't like it was busy any couldn't help me but I can again I would check it out another time and update my review has it stands now a little bit low on personality needs to do a better job I've seen a better job.
