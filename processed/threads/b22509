1 Unbelievable!!! We order my mom, which is dying of cancer some "edible arrangements" for Valentines day, hoping it would bring a smile to her face! All day long we tracked the order and it said "in transit" the day came and went and my moms arrangement never showed up!!! Almost $60 bucks down the drain! We told my mom something was coming the day before, so she was excited, only nothing ever came!! And on top of it all, NOT EVEN A PHONE CALL letting us know that they were not going to be able to fulfill the order, at least if they had let us know we could have gotten her some flowers or something to replace it. THANKS "EDIBLE ARRANGEMENTS", thanks a lot for let my mom down!!!!!!!! I'm not even mad about it, In fact I'm very sadden by it......
1 Don't think you can stop in if you're in a pinch for a present. Went on Sunday to pick something up for my moms husbands bday. Arrived at 2pm which was closing time on Sunday...I get that but I would have thought in a customer friendly business that they would have been more accommodating. All the lady said was it was "2 o'clock like her coach turned into a pumpkin! No sorry, no other offer, nothing. We ran next door to Fry's who had a lovely section of premade baskets  and gifts and got him a basket of wine, chocolate, a movie and a cute stuffed animal for $30....which is about what I would have spent on 12 pieces if fruit dipped in chocolate. Save your money and skip this place and go to Frys.
