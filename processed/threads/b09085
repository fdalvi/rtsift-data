4 There isn't much I dislike doing more on vacation then having to deal with my hair. Unfortunately, I wasn't blessed with beautiful wash and go hair but I sure wanted to look like I did on a recent trip to Arizona. So, I stopped into Fantastic Sams and asked them to wash and blow my hair. They took me right away and I had very nice looking hair for a few days. Came out to about $22 after tip, which is a couple dollars high for a low end salon like this, in arizona, but it was definitely a price I was willing to pay to not have to deal with my hair for the majority of the trip.  -1 star for the gook these places always put in your hair after styling it. It might help it look nice the first day but it just makes your hair greasier faster and makes you have to wash out your beatiful blowout sooner because of all the oils.
1 My husband and I went in for a 1 buzz and a bang trim. It's hard to mess up a buzz so my husband is fine but my bangs are a crying shame. She hardly wet them down even though I has them pulled to the side do the length. They're crooked and there are multiple stands that are too long. I had to fix them myself with kitchen scissors before I would leave the house. It's a shame. This location is usually pretty good.
