4 So I am going thru first-time-remodeling-a-home-anxiety (hellloo... the 80s called and wants all their light fixtures back!)...  Call me naive.. but where do you go to find light fixtures after Lowe's, Home Depot and Lamps Plus?!  By chance I drove by this store after a Lowe's light fixture purchase that I wasn't completely in love with...  THIS is my holy grail lighting store (does it count if I've only been to 4 places?!  But I don't want to order online... I'm a touchy feely home decorator apparently...)  Many styles without being dated & cheesey and prices of all ranges (whereas Lamps Plus just made my eyes bug).  The sales assoc was so kind and friendly, willing to climb up and down ladders to look at price tags and gave me info sheets on the models I was interested in.    As each outdated fixture goes, I'll be enthusiastically stopping by here...
5 What a great experience!  Had a fun time shopping, and Shawn let me take home catalogs to find just what I wanted.  They aren't installed yet, but the "hunt" is over.  I would certainly recommend this place to others.
5 Had a great experience shopping for lighting and ceiling fans here. They have a nice variety of lights and fans on display. They can also order anything from a huge selection of catalogs. Ashley and Shawn were both extremely helpful with all our questions. They helped me find a kitchen under-cabinet LED lighting system to fit my needs. They showed me samples, explained installation considerations, and custom-fit a solution for me.  I bought all the parts from them, but unfortunately, I wasn't able to go with it due to a problem my electrician uncovered in my kitchen. Lighting Design cheerfully refunded my full purchase with no hassle. Will definitely shop there again for lighting or ceiling fans.
5 With a friendly, knowledgeable staff and a great selection of lights this is a great place to shop for your lighting decor.  Take time to look around because they have a wide range of products other than lights - they have funiture pieces, mirrors and misc art that can make get accessories in any room.  Shopping here is fun as well as beneficial. And an extra bonus is that the prices are comparable or better when they have a sale. If you don't see what you are looking for they have lots and lots of catalogs and they are very good about helping you.
5 We have now worked with this company 3 different times. Each time they were very professional, helpful and gave us the best prices around. I am always amazed at the quality we can get for the prices that they offer. This is definitely should be your go to place for lighting!!!
