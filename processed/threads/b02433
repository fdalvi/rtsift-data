3 Not to shabby... Tried Jack in the Box on my recent trip to Arizona, and overall it was okay.  Ordered the double cheeseburger with curly fries.  Burger was good, not the best, but tasty and the curly fries were okay as well.  Will definitely try them again.  Overall, okay food, okay service, okay prices.
4 I don't normally review fast food joints, but this place deserves a good review.  They hire good people and train them really well.   Fast food chains thrive on consistency and this Jack in the Box location is VERY consistent.  Jack in the Box done right.
1 Jack in the box sucks now! My food was cold, I've actually never had a pleasant experience at this location. I think jack in the box is one place I will never go again.
