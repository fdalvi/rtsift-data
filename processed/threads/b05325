5 In working with Mr. Pontoni I have found him to always be focused first on understanding his clients and their needs before conducting business.  Combined with a professional approach and his deep knowledge and expertise in the law, Michael is top notch attorney who I would recommend to anyone.
1 what Jea J said is all true ,I also retained Mr Pontoni and with poor results.There are more qualified attornies out there that might actually care about you and your case and not be so weak.
