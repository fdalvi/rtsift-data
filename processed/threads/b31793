1 How hard is it to get a decent review for dry cleaning?  Drop off clothes, pick it, looks clean, BAM 3-4 stars right.   Drop off clothes, seems clean.  Crease on suit is not the same place so the crease looks off now.   Alterations: don't go here for that, I had them sew up a pocket on dress pants that seem to be coming loose. I got it back and it looked half down, missing a stich like the other pocket that was not ripped.   She responds " I am not a miracle worker"  WTH does that mean, it's a stich on a machine not parting the red sea.   Attitude with bad service = bad review.
4 They're close, nice, and professional. What else can you ask for.
