3 I've rented cars all over the US and Canada.  By far and away, Enterprise shows this ability to care about their customer standing in front of them and wants their repeat business.  Nic at Enterprise is the best and they go the extra distance to make sure you're happy and come back!     I know I'm repeating myself, but why cannot the rest of the rental car industry think like Enterprise?
1 LOOK OUT.....You can make a reservation with Enterprise, have it confirmed (complete with "confirmation #") and then show up at this location and guess what ....NO CARS...not ONE single car available.  Then why did you take my reservation and confirm it.   SO, if you are looking for a reliable rental car company, one that will have your "reserved car" when you get there, you better think twice before you rent with Disaster-prise.
3 I had one of my cars in the body shop and needed a rental car for the week while it was getting repaired.  Enterprise has a location on-site at the repair shop to deliver/drop off a car.  Since I made an appointment in advance, I got the car that I wanted....a full-size car.  The process was very easy and convenient.  I chose the pre-paid full tank option because it was much cheaper than the going price for gas...nice benefit.  I hope I don't have another accident that I would need the services of this location.  However, if I do, I will gladly use them again.  Return Factor - 75%
