5 Net knows his stuff. A lot of different flavors and a good selection of mods. The shop is very clean and the theme really goes with the name of the place. A very friendly shop and the owner Net will take care of you.
5 Finally a vape shop that's not Ã¼ber far. Dan and Net are the owners and they are really friendly and knowledgable.   This is my new go to vape store b/c of the convenient location and great customer service. It is located in the new plaza in Southern Highlands; by Speedy Mart, behind Bank of America. The vibe is really chill. They have a dark asian feel in their motif; lots of interesting art pieces on the walls. They're also the first vape shop I saw with a fish tank.   The first time I visited the store I met the owners, Dan and Net. Dan was really funny and welcoming. Since they've opened I've been dropping by the store to pick up juice. I went by the shop again with my bf to get new coils for his vape. I wanted to write a review since Net did a superb job on the coils. The man knows how to build.   If you haven't gone here, you need to go...now.   P.S. Their Fruit Loops flavor is so yummy.
5 This store is AWESOME! Went here for the for the first time last week and LOVED it.! Net was so friendly and most of all knew his stuff. I went in for one thing and walked out with 5 new things! I was fast and friendly and prices were competitive. I will be back soon!
