4 Babycakes Cafe is a solid small business that provides fabulous service and good food.  I stopped in for a spinach and cheese omlette with fresh fruit and bacon.  Very tasty ...
2 I really wanted to like this place more than I did. I was really looking forward to trying it out after grabbing their menu the last time I walked by.  I Ordered the FIG and PROSCIUTTO PITA (caramelized fig and onions, prosciutto and Oaxaca cheese melted and served with orange rosemary dipping sauce. Side choice I picked was chips and hummus.  OK I didn't even take a picture because it wasn't that pretty The Hummus was green like guacamole, I dared to taste it and ....YUCK!    My pita was wrapped in that deli paper, once I removed that I noticed that the whole pita was split open on the bottom...Shame on them for serving me a broken pita!  After one bite I had to remove the Prosciutto because it was way too thick and pungent, prosciutto should always be PAPER THIN.  So I bite again and my figs and onions are a bit cold......sigh..... Although the pita was warm and soft and the cheese was melted properly.  The highlight of my dish was the Orange Rosemary dipping sauce it was delicious paired with this sandwich minus the prosciutto, had my pita not been broken and cold it would have been perfect.  I did not like the fact that when chef #1 came to see if I was doing OK she went back to report to chef #2 how I had picked off the prosciutto.....  No wonder I was the only customer in the place!  Hardly worth $11 and some change  2 stars for The Orange Rosemary sauce!!   I went to The Urban Tea Loft after and Had myself a Lunch Worth Payin' For!
1 I think I might have become the yelp town crier of closed restaurants. CLOSED is babycakes.
