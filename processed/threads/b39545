5 I've been seeing Stephen for my haircuts and salon services for about eight years now, which is officially longer than any relationship I've ever had. It was exciting news to find out that he'd ventured out to open his own space, which is tucked inside the Moda Fina Studios on Camelback. There's nothing worse than finding out your hair stylist has moved to a new salon, so the side benefit of this opening, is that I'll always know where to find him.   The salon features exclusive Kevin Murphy hair products, a comfortable, chic space and the best hair guy in town. Love it.
5 I found Stephen when I needed a color correction after another stylist accidentally dyed my hair black.  Getting black out of any hair is usually a chore, but Stephen was able to restore my hair to it's proper color without damaging it.  Not only can he do really great color, he is a masterful stylist when it comes to cutting hair.  I have had bangs my whole life and it is not easy to find someone who does them just the way I ask, and he did.  If I could give 6 stars I would!
5 Stephen Lynch is a hair genius!!   I've been seeing Stephen for about 4 years now, and every time I go in, I leave feeling completely pampered. He not only gives the best scalp massages on earth, but his attention to detail and his passion for hair is evident in the amount of time he will spend with you every single time you go in. It seems like Stephen never has an off day!   I've only had my hair cut by Stephen (I don't color my hair) and no matter where I go I have people stopping me on the street - complete strangers - to ask me who styled my hair! I could not recommend Stephen more highly!
