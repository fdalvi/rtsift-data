1 Where do I start.  I ordered a pie for delivery about a month ago, and it got here late.  I didn't worry about it, but the driver did apologize.  Today, I received a coupon for a free large pie due to the last late delivery, so I thought I would use it.  To make a long story short, I should have just placed the order for pick up over the phone.  Apparently, phone orders trump walk in business at this location.  Even though I was the only customer for nearly 30 minutes, my order was placed dead last behind any phone order that was called in.  Dominos...Pizza Hut...Papa John's...it's all the same.  At least Dominos is hot and fresh to your door in 30 minutes.  We're in an Economic Depression.  I don't need to spend money at a place that has no customer service...and no comprehension of process.  Hasta, Papa.  You blow.
1 We ordered 2 extra large 16" pizzas. When I went to pick up the pizzas I commented that both pizzas appeared  small and how the box appeared to be too large for the pizzas. 2 employees assured me that both pizzas were 16".   When I arrived home with the pizzas my wife also commented how small they were so we took out a ruler and measured them both at 14" which is the size of a "Large" not the 16" "Extra large" which we ordered and paid for. I drove back to Papa Johns on Anthem Village Dr. with the pizzas and asked for the manager. He told me that both pizzas were 16" and there was NO PROBLEM. I then pulled out my ruler and the manager said well if you want I will remake them for you. The franchise owner is having the employees make smaller than ordered size pizzas and charging the customer for the larger size. They are now also charging $0.10 per packet for cheese & red pepper. Time to find another pizza place in 89052 that does not steal from customers.
5 This place is Rocks!!  Always good service....I've been coming here for years and am never disspointed!!
