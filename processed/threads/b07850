2 Not my favorite Dillard's-- but I had to exchange my some shirts I bought for my husband and the lady working in the men's department was very helpful finding the right sizes. On the other hand, the girls in the fragrance and make-up departments were completely useless!! They were more interested in gossiping than making a sale. :-( Bad bad experience.
2 2.5 Stars  Dillard's at the Desert Sky Mall may not be the best store in the fleet, but it serves a purpose for me.  This red headed step-child store lacks inventory compared to other stores.  This store is pretty close to my house and can always find my Clinique products without a long trek to the bigger Dillard's.  This store is also the store where I make my returns.    I understand the changing climate of this mall will ultimately force Dillard's out, but hope that the huge Litchfield Park mall is finally built and will most likely house a state of the art Dillard's.  Until then, how about sprucing up this Dillard's which is in desperate need of it!  The clientele at this mall may not support this store financially but a remodel will attract folks who would normally drive up to Arrowhead Mall.
4 Man, I'm telling you, this Dillard's is a gold mine in the west valley!  It would be a day trip for me to drive to a decent mall to go shopping.  However this Dillard's has come through for me so many times.  When I need a quick outfit and don't have all day to shop I hit up this place.   I'm always amazed at how good the sale items are and there aren't that many people shopping here so the selection is great.  There is this one rack of jewelry by the escalator that is marked at 30%  - shit needs to go or be priced to sell at 70% off.    After Christmas I scored some nice decor at 80% off,  I look forward to going back next year.  I grab my Clinque products here and the makeup counter ladies are a pain in the ass but still, I appreciate the convenience.
