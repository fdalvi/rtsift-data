5 I have been using PC Perfect for probably 10 years or more. I used them at my previous company and now use them for my own business and private needs.  They are able to do many things remotely, but are on top of it if you need to drop your computer off at their shop.  They have been very quick and attentive to my issues and get my computer back into my hands as soon as possible.  The prices are fair and on par with what I have seen at other places.  Locally owned and operated so they care about small businesses.
5 My businesses have used PC Perfect for years and I cannot say enough good things about their services. They come on site quickly when needed and keep my offices running. We have some pretty complex systems running different types of software and PC Perfect manages to keep everything running.  I would definitely recommend their services.
5 We always trust PC Perfect with all of our mid-sized business tech support needs. Their comprehensive experience is complimented with fast, friendly, & reliable service. I highly recommend the team at PC Perfect to any business with networking and tech support needs.
