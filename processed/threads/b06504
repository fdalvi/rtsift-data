4 My family and I really enjoy living here at the Viviani apartments. The staff is GREAT and very helpful and the maintenance staff is very friendly and responses very quickly to our request. We would recommend anyone to consider the Viviani apartments as a place to call home.  #2079
1 Horribly under-qualified and unhelpful staff. Pray an emergency doesn't happen where you need to call the office because your calls will not be picked up or returned. Don't try to set up a meeting either, the manager ran out the back door when I was supposed to meet with her. Oh and on top of all that as if rent, deposits and a cleaning fee aren't enough expect random fees and charges for nothing. Worst choice I made was moving into this complex. On top of horrible staff the safety is at an all time low. 5 burglaries in only a week or two? Don't depend on the staff to notify you about these dangerous occurrences they like to keep information like this on the down low to maintain their "reputation"  Take my advice and keep looking there are a so many better apartments in Las Vegas.
