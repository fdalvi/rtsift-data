3 On my way to work today while I was jamming out to some Lucky Boys Confusion (hipster namedropping from the 90's ftw suck it Trebek), I couldn't help but notice the orange "low fuel" icon on my dashboard.  What a fool I was, I neglected to fill up my gas tank near my house so now I was caught in a dilemma between filling up my gas tank at this station on my way from work (while losing valuable minutes because of rush hour traffic) or to fill it up during my lunch hour.  *Or not stop at all and let AAA tow my car to the nearest station once my fuel went out...but let's ignore this possibility*  I decided to fill up my tank during lunch.  (5 Stars FTW)  Then while I was filling up my gas tank a homeless guy with a sign walked up to me.  (3 Stars FTL)  I then took his sign and told him I have no money and ate the sign.  (4 Stars)  He then said he was deaf.  To which I replied, "how do you now what I was saying".  He then said, "lip reading".   So we stood there...for 1 minute, without saying a word.  (2 Stars)  Then he cried  (3 Stars)  Then I remembered the second half of this exchange never really happened, except for the homeless guy approaching me part, which was awkward but it kind of made one of my nipples hard.  So if you take anything from this review, this is a gas station, 3 stars for doing it's purpose :)
3 It's a gas station.   But it has a car wash. For my lazy ass who doesn't want to wash my car by hand, I like stations like this and there's one near my parent's place. Which means, when I visit, I can fill up and wash the bug guts and dust off my ride.   As for the convenience store, I wouldn't know. I haven't set foot in there in all the years this place has been around.   I fill up. Drive thru the wash. And leave.
4 Sandwiches  are GREAT but the lady who makes them always seems to be annoyed while doing her job an just makes it awkward anytime you try to interact with her. Not only that but she doesn't take orders as they come in its always whatever she feels like doing first.
