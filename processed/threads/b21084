4 I used to think that Whistles was quite frumpy/school teacher-esque but on my recent visit I realised that their clothes are now going in a completely different direction, appealing to a much broader audience.  First of all, the lay out of the shop is super cute, it's painted white a fresh, the clothes are well organised and they have even have little blue origami flowers adorning the walls. I'm a huge origami fan so this was the icing on the cake for me.  I spotted a few dresses that were just gorgeous and just so unusual. One in particular was green with little white doves on it, the material was light and soft making it the perfect summer dress, it was also perfectly shaped and I could tell it would have fitted like a glove had I tried it on. I decided not to try it on as it was £135, while that isn't completely ridiculous for a dress, I can't really justify spending that at the moment as I have so many other things on my list. I also noticed  much more affordable items such as fitted skirts for £40.  The have a wide range of sizes and stock size 6-16.
