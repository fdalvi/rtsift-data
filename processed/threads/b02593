3 I love the $6 Guac/bacon cheeseburger, and the ice cream cookie sandwich...but that's it. If ordering chicken in the drive thru...expect to wait...and wait.
3 I miss the Carl's Jr from back in the days. The burgers were so much bigger. They are good still but I remember the ol days when you got more for your $$$. I am thankful tho for the military discount.
1 Awful service. Obviously there is an issue with the management at this place.The employees were yelling and calling each other out in front of the customers which made it very awkward for me and my friends. It took a good 3 minutes for anyone to come to the register to take our order, and after that it took about 30 minutes for all of us to get our food. I was finished eating by the time the last person in my group got their food. The poor people I could see waiting for 10 minutes in the drive through! Also I saw the employees in the back handling the food and making burgers who were NOT wearing gloves. Good thing I only got fries and a shake!! I had never been to a Carl's Jr in my life and probably will never go back.
