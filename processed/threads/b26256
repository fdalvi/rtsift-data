5 I followed Melinda here when my last Dr. closed her practice to move to another state. I have never been more at ease at a dentist's office than this one. The staff are great and Dr. White is by far the best dentist I've had. I love how they show you pictures of your teeth in the big screen tv so you can see for yourself what needs to be done and why.  Melinda and Jenn (hygienist) are excellent with my little girls who usually are with me during my visits.   My previous dentists ended up not moving and reopened her practice, but I'm very happy with Dr. White.
5 This is by far the best dentist I have ever had the pleasure of visiting.  A welcoming friendly staff who love what they do and are so good at what they do.
