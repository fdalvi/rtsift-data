5 I recommend the b-12 shots for anyone in chronic pain.  B12 shots have helped my wife periodically over the years to cope with her chronic pain.  I'm no doctor, but I know a good pain relief when I see it. Glad we have a place in the valley that offers these shots.
5 I have gotten my B-12 shots here and they are great. I got the ones that also help with metabolism. It has given me more energy and helped me with my weight loss goals and staying fit. The staff is wonderful and very efficient. I recommend getting the shots and doing the wraps and other services they offer. I have not been sick this whole year due to the B-12 shots and an early flu-shot in August.
