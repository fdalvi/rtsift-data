4 For my first experience of a kebab, I was suitably impressed. And I wasn't even drunk! This takeaway just looks like your average takeaway, and even has a fruit machine. That makes me chuckle.  After never having a kebab we went here one Saturday night because it always smells so good when you walk past. We both had the special which was about Â£8 each. Quite expensive! But it turned out to be on of those silver dishes with pita bread filled with every type of meat imaginable. Chicken, lamb, beef and that weird stuff they shave. I'm not sure what meat that is? With lashings of sauce and salad, it was a huge meal. Neither of us finished it but it was pretty damn good.  The meat was tasty and tender, not the chewy, tasteless crap I was expecting.   The menu also offers pizzas and chips too, and it seems quite popular as there was a constant stream of people going in and out while we waited. I would think the true test of a kebab is if it is edible when sober. Therefore, this place passes with flying colours.
