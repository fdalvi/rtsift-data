3 Takes a long time to get through to make an appointment. I was on hold 5 minutes and then sent to a random voicemail. When I called back I was immediately put on hold again for another 5 minutes...Maybe they need more staff.
4 Dr McCoy is outstanding, he and Dr Brent Rich (Dr Rich is now in UT) have helped our family numerous times with various injuries, aches and pains over the past 11 years. Some of the staff may not be our top choice, but Dr McCoy is definitely worth dealing with any other aggravation.
1 They've really been in a steep service decline over the past 18 mos.  McCoy spends his time at ASU.  PA Ian comes in one a day a week.  PA Alice doesn't return calls even when you go there, at the counter, and ask to have her call.  I've had questions about the medication they prescribed for two weeks-crickets chirping.  TIME TO MOVE ON.
5 Dr McCoy is excellent, as a healthcare provider too I know I got a good Sports med doctor with him. I do agree with some comments that the front desk staff needs improvement.
