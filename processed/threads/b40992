4 Finally!  Hot yoga is moving to NE Mesa!    Found this new hot yoga studio on Groupon.  Great deal for 10 weeks and you have 90 days to utilized.  Went to visit the studio first before I purchased the Groupon and was sold immediately.  It's nice and clean and they have a great little Green Bar featuring fresh greens juices.  I picked up the schedule and signed up for my 1st class.  I like that they offer regular yoga and the hot yoga.  The hot yoga is intense and it's nice to have an option if you're not ready for it.  The staff and instructor were nice and helpful.  During the class they assisted with positions to get that better stretch and no pressure if you can't do the intense yoga positions.  If you need to take a break you simply lay on your mat take a break and drink H2o.    Great schedule options everyday of the week.
