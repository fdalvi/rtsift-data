4 A great place with low prices and hard work! The alterations are done by this really sweet korean lady, and she is the best!!! Immaculate and price worthy!!! This business has been opened for over 15 years. A very established business and friendly workers,  I've been using this dry cleaners for over 10 years now. Have tried other places, but never satisfied.  I would never take my clothes or comforters to anywhere else.  Though it is kind of in a not so good neighborhood, it's worth it.  I give em 4 stars only because the neighborhood is bad...  Give them a shot, you won't be dissapointed!!!
4 The staff is rude but I think I enjoy the abuse. For the great pricing, they could cane me for all I care. I can get my dress jackets dry cleaned for $7. That 3-piece leisure suit of mine can be cleaned and pressed for $14. The best part is, if I happen to not make it in to pick up my clothes on the day they're ready (or the week they're ready), the staff doesn't seem too concerned.  Sure, it's next to ghetto Fry's. But I've been pleased with the results for the past year so I'll continue to patronize Key Cleaners.
2 Prices are great but received an article of clothing back with a hole in it. There are better dry cleaning options in the area.
