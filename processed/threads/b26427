1 Did a lot of business with this company decided to have an order done somewhere else asked for the artwork that I paid for been getting the runaround for a week now wasn't thrilled with the product that I got originally but the people were nice and planned on doing future business with them based on the hassles and trying to get my own property back from them May have to rethink that   Will update good or bad.  Finally got my artwork after owner talking all kinds of crap to my partner about me because I'd ask for a price and didn't move forward with an order guys a jerk don't recommend doing business with them
5 I have been going to Basic Sports for football equipment and uniforms.  Never have had a problem with an order and the staff is very friendly.  They have worked with my son to find a helmet that doesn't hurt him.   Will go back!!!
1 It's hit or miss with this company...but mostly miss! I have had a hard time getting the sizes I've ordered & they don't seem to want to remedy any situation when it's their fault.
