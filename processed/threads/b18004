4 Naked coffee beans get hot and bothered right in the store and then get in a bit of a grind.  Nice mix of hot and cold choices on the menu and tempting desserts mocking you from their glass confines.  Of course I had to try the Black Dragon...a blended iced coffee mocha with a little kiss of cherry flavoring.  Y U M.  The owner was extremely nice too, always helps.  So for my first visit, I was very happy.  I didn't give a five star only because I only tried one drink so far.  I'm sure it'll be changing soon, plus I'd rather support a local business like his than Star"lots-o"bucks.
5 I love local business. Especially when they have great customer service like Toshi's!   I too have had the green tea smoothie, and what a delightful treat it was! I've also had their blended coffee, and iced coffee. Both far exceed the quality of that "S" coffee place. What's so great about the blended drinks at Toshi's is that they *shock* actually blend all the ice!! At the "S" place, I usually have chunks of ice at the bottom which greatly annoys me. Not so at Toshi's! And they always toast the bagels, which is great. They have limited outdoor seating, and they don't mind if you bring your well-behaved dogs.   Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the most important part....they roast their own coffee on site!!! So you know that you are getting very fresh coffee. And you can tell....the taste is so smooth and not even a little bitter.   Now what are you waiting for? You know you want to go to Toshi's!
3 I have mixed feelings about the coffee. Are they purposely burning their beans to be like Starbucks or was it just a bad batch?  I am a coffee purist so I dropped three shots on a shot of half and half. The location of the store may not be the best for a coffee shop.  That is, if there was something besides strip malls on this side of the 101.
