4 Very clean shop. Everything seemed to be hand selected, and was nicely organized.
4 Our fridge broke and we did not want to pay an arm and leg for another. I was on Craigslist and seen their ad. We paid a good price. I told the owners that I was going to spread the word about them. Hands down, great place to find quality products for great prices.
1 We bought a fridge from them and it is an absolute piece of junk! The shelves are broken. They tried to hide it by glueing parts back together. Other shelves, they didn't even bother to try to fix.  The fridge has been on for over 24 hours and won't get down to safe food temperatures. Now I have to try to get my money back....urg!
