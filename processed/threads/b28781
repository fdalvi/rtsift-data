2 I graduated from Marinello at the end of August 2010, and let me tell you, I was glad to get out of there. While the teachers were very knowledgeable in their trade, the program and administration is less than desirable. When I first toured the school and started classes in January, I was promised many things to learn, one of them being makeup classes. Still to this day they do not have those classes available at the school, and those were pretty big reasons to why I wanted to go there. There was also a lot of drama in the midst of my schooling there. Several administrators left, a teacher left, and they changed everything that we were used to. They started focusing on advertising instead of getting students product to use, and there was a lot of times when school product would go missing when they didn't go missing before the administration change. besides those things, the school is okay. At the very least, it will teach you what  you need to know to be an aesthetician in the state. But I definitely wouldn't go there again, and I definitely wouldn't recommend anybody to go there. Be sure to look around at other schools before you decide what's best for you.
