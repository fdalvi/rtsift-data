5 Ah, I'm home. This is the best place to get coffee in Edinburgh (narrowly pipping Kilimanjaro). Your coffee may take a couple of minutes to arrive, but it will definitely be worth it. If its been a few weeks since your last proper flat white, you may even tremble, or go a little weak at the knees with your first sip. The coffee is strong, and the foam is perfect; with thousands Wellington Coffee flat whites under my belt I can only recall one that was a bit burnt.    They also serve fantastic baking, from scones with yummy ginger & rhubarb preserve, to authentic Edmunds Cook Book Banana Cake (for the Kiwi's who know what that is!).    The cafe is conveniently located in the corner of George St & Hanover St, but you'll need to look down as the entrance is below street level. With comfy couches and stools, and chairs perfectly placed for people watching, the only danger is that you'll lose track of time, and end up drinking more than your weekly dose of caffeine in one go. If the weather is good, why not sit outside?    Make sure you pick up a loyalty card when you pop in, you'll get every 10th cup free! Flat white = Â£2.10
