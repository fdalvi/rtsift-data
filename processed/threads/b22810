5 I was hungry to try a good new buffet for lunch on this Monday, & my experience has been that the one's at casinos are always excellent, so I wheeled down to Harvest Buffet, within Harrah's Ak-Chin Casino, to give it a try.  Upon arrival I joined the player's club (as you should always do).  At times this might get you the buffet for free, but at this time it only saves you a dollar but puts you on the mailing list for discounts & freebies later.  The casino is nice though, & I headed into the restaurant with lots of positive anticipation!  The layout of the food tables reminded me of Eagles Buffet at Casino Arizona, except that this one is lighted more brightly, & has a higher, very artsy ceiling.  In fact, the entire restaurant is built with a lot of "Indian" style, and I found it to be a completely comfortable place to eat.  I started with a tasty seafood soup that I can't remember the name of, salad, and then started trying the different hot choices.  The selection is large, and today there was a Thai section, a Mexican section, an Italian section, & an American section.  There was also vegetarian fare, seafood, & more... & everything I had room to try, about half of the main items out, was just great!  There were lots of beautiful desserts out too, but I didn't have room for them this time.  I'm a diner, not a gambler, but just fun, on the way out, I stuck my new "Total Rewards" card & $20 in a slot machine, to show a little appreciation.  As UNexpected, a few minutes later I cashed out with $68.89!  Needless to say, I love this place, & plan to return next Monday for another terrific meal!  The hotel & pool look inviting too, so I might just make it an overnighter.  Lunch 9.99 ======================= Monday 6/29/09 - Today it was back to Harvest Buffet, my favorite of all buffet restaurants in the Valley!  Gadzooks it was good!!  Even though I was returning on the same day of the week as last time, the food was mostly not a repeat, & it was just terrific.  Yes, it's a bit of a drive for many of us down to Maricopa, but I think it's worth it.  P.S.  This is a good-sized place, but the secret is out about how good it is, & it pretty much fills up by about 11:30 AM.  Be there at 11 if you can. ====================== Thu 1/14/10 - Have been here several more times... still totally 5-Stars!  The Cream of Mushroom Soup today was soooo the best I have ever tasted!!  That's how it goes with this place.
5 went to the Saturday seafood buffet here and after a two hour wait in line i finally got a seat. When I got seated I was starving and it was a good thing because this was the best buffet i have ever been to.They had piles of crab legs ,steamed clams,mussels,grilled salmon.crispy frog legs and various shrimp dishes as well as a mountain of peel and eat shrimp.There was also prime rib and a couple of chicken dishes. As far as veggies go they had bok choy with shitake mushrooms,brussel sprouts,corn on the cob. they sure now how to put on a good buffet. As far as the two hour wait , well it was worth it this food rocked. I would recommend this one to anyone and it is on Fridays and Saturdays 4pm to 10 pm
5 Like the two previeous poster, I had great food here. Especially the prime rib - zee best !!!!
3 Besides being pulled over by the AK Chin police for a bad headlight while trying to speed my way to the buffet one late Friday night, I generally love the Ak Chin community.  I believe that this Harrahs was the first one in the area ( meaning Maricopa and Pinal Counties) to have a hotel attached to it.  Anyhoo... the buffet is what you want to know about... Because if I talk about the cheesy entertainment that one expects at a casino lounge, I would perhaps remove one star.  At the buffet, for $20 per person unless you have some points for gambling even more, you can enjoy the seafood buffet on Friday and Saturday nights.  And they are not playing.  I was actually impressed.  I went in with not so high expectations because we are in the desert and looking for seafood here has taught me a lesson or two in the past, but I have to tell you that the king crab legs were in abundance, the shrimp scampi and mussels were pleasing to the eye and tongue and the rest of the buffet was very good!  There was something for everyone.  There was shrimp, calamari, and steamed clams too.  I was really also happy to note a carving station and desserts. While I wish that they served Coke products, I did find that the meal and service was worthy of repeat business and that the replenishment of fresh items was done timely and with a smile even VERY late into their service.
5 Just a quick update to say that this place is still just terrific!  Friends ask me, "Which Buffet to you go to most often?"  Here it is!  In fact, I eat here more often than any other single restaurant, buffet or not, even though it's 48 miles from my house.  It's that good!    :-))  Lunch Buffet $9.99 including beverage.
5 I've been here twice.  It is fantastic.  The only drawback is the 50-60 minute drive to get here from Central Phoenix, but it is totally worth it.  Friday and Saturday nights have the seafood buffet.  Since I've been on a quest for the best seafood buffet out here in the desert...this one is the winner so far.
5 = = = = = = = = = = = =  CLOSED, SORT OF!  = = = = = = = = = = = =   This great restaurant has morphed into "The Buffet", at the same location.  This was a 100% remodel of the space in the building, but it's still the same owners (& management, presumably).  The new restaurant in it's place is possibly even better, & you can enjoy the Lunch Buffet for an even lower price than before!    The foods offered have changed some, but if you loved what they served at Harvest Buffet, you'll REALLY love "The Buffet"!  Also, it's very comfortable inside & the staff was super friendly when I was there for the Grand Opening today!     :-))
5 We have eaten here only for lunches on Fridays or Saturdays, and the food is great.  The newly remodeled Buffet is better than before. More food offerings including a grill. I have yet to come across anything among the plentyful variety  that was not well prepared and served at the proper temperature.  The staff is cheerful and helpful.  Easily worth the 40 minute drive from Chandler.  Prices are discounted if you have a casino players club card which is free.
1 Would have liked to eat here, but after it took 30 mins. for parking on a Thursday afternoon, we got there right at 3:00 and were turned away because it was "closed." Even though the buffet still looked open and people were there still serving themselves (i.e.: stuffing their faces), I was turned away and told to come back on another day. Based on this as my first impression, I will not return. I am wondering, then, if I had arrived just 5 minutes earlier, would I have been served? I guess this doesn't really matter considering I won't return another time, as the manager so glibly suggested.
2 One day we decided to make the drive out to Maricopa to check out the Harrah's casino.  When we arrived, we were hungry and decided to give their buffet a try.  We were really disappointed.  The selection of food was not very good.  The best items was the Ice Cream and desserts....which were average at best.  It was one of those meals where you got mad at yourself for wasting calories on bland food.  Oh well.  One good thing is that the cashier at the buffet told us we'd get a discount for signing up for a players club card.  We did and got a good discount, unfortunately the food wasn't worthwhile.  Return Factor - 5%
