5 This place is a great for those vintage/mid century modern finds. From clothing to couches they have it all and great prices too.  They have similar items to their neighbors Modern Manor, but not the "designer" prices.  We got a green vintage chair for $98 and just are having the skirt around the bottom removed to show the great legs on it.  We will always check back at Melrose when looking for unique pieces for our home.
5 What a great place! Modern on Melrose has amazing furniture at great prices. I highly recommend and will be back when I am looking for new pieces.
4 Favorite vintage store I have been in. I have been going to a lot lately looking for midcentury furniture that won't empty out my bank account. Happened to drive by this place and decided to take a look. I got a 3 piece coffee table and side tables set for 60 bucks. Can't beat that. The lady working I completely loved! She was helpful and let me know what kind of stuff will be coming in. This will be a weekly stop for me.  If you are looking for awesome vintage furniture in good shape this is the place to go. They know their stuff. A lot of awesome lamps and boomerang coffee tables. It is a must visit.  update: seems like items are getting higher and higher. style has changed a bit. still nice stuff if you wanna empty your bank account. no longer a weekly stop but i will still  stop by.
1 Unfortunately, Yelp does not allow negative stars. I was very much looking forward to going to Modern on Melrose as my sister had raved about the selection and several purchases she recently made here. I was all set to help her select more furniture for her new home until I experienced a combination of disbelief, shock and horror.   I was inside the store when I heard a man loudly say "If you're going to start a sale, finish it!" It took a few more seconds of loud voices before I realized an argument was taking place between two employees and not two customers, as I initially thought. The male and female employee continued to loudly argue, back and forth. Feeling very uncomfortable, I started to look for my sister. There were about four other customers and we all ended up outside as we all felt very uncomfortable in the store.   As I was walking out of the store to go out back, I heard the male employee say, in a tone that was beyond anger but instead violent, "Don't you ever tell me to shut up! Ever!" Shortly after, he walked past all 5 female customers, who had gathered out back, turned to us and angrily said "Bitch!" Not knowing what he was going to do when he returned, we decided to leave as we did not feel safe.   It is one thing to feel uncomfortable, it is completely unacceptable to not feel safe. The interaction between the two employees was the most unprofessional thing I have ever witnessed. The male and female employee were so caught up in their own negative interaction, neither of them offered any customer service. And after their argument ended, the female employee offered no apologies and still no customer service.   Today was my first and last time in Modern on Melrose. How terribly sad for this store. I sincerely hope the owners get a handle on this and educate their employees as to what it and isn't acceptable behavior.
4 I walked in here looking for a specific piece of furniture.  I didn't find it, but what I did find were so many things that I didn't even know I needed!  So much cool stuff here, go check it out!
1 Disappointing.  I've been there twice hoping that a re-return would change my original opinion.  The first time I was there was on a Saturday, early afternoon in Spring.  I found it strange that I was the only one in the store for about 20 minutes, until another customer came in.  Melrose is usually a pretty happening place during the Spring before summer temps hit.  I saw a lot of nice 1960s furniture, mostly living room sets and home decor.  Prices were on the high end for, let's face it folks, used furniture. The blonde lady who came out to greet me after I made it to their second room (there are 3 rooms total) was frazzled and preoccupied with eating her lunch. So I went back again last week.  Didn't see the frazzled lady from before but a mid-age hipster guy at the counter who didn't have the time to greet me (sorry I disrupted your cell phone surfing).  Yep.  I was the ONLY person in the store and you obviously ignored me.    It's just an unwelcoming place.  So much potential, but the attitude there is less than acceptable.  Will spend my $$$ elsewhere.
5 Highly recommended. Went in yesterday looking for a dresser to use as a tv stand. Found the perfect piece for the retro look I'm going for. I found some other small decor items. Price was fair and they delivered today.  Shawn did a great job. Keep up the good work! I will definitely be back.
