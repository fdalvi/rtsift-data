1 They never answered their phone. Maybe they're out of business?
1 Why does anyone go there?  Horrible customer service
5 We shopped for engagement rings from both two national stores (that advertise like crazy) and two local jewelers. Ultimately we wanted to support local business. This jeweler gave me an amazing ring at an incredible price. He also included the appraisal (can you believe some stores don't?).   They have been in business since 1946 and I bought a ring from them 25 years ago that was beautiful, but this ring is simply stunning. They are more wholesalers than they are retailers, which may explain the customer service dings they've gotten from two reviews. However, they treated me and my fianc√© very well.  I highly recommend them.
5 I don't know how this place could possibly have less than 5 stars. I've been here several times for different reasons. The first time I had several antique pearl strands that I wanted restrung. That was 4 years ago and they still are hanging on beautifully. I just went in to get a ring appraisal a week ago and the man at the front was extremely helpful. I feel like I could have talked with him for hours. I left the store feeling informed and educated on my ring.   I was referred here from the Nordstrom jeweler in Scottsdale. She told me that they send things here to get fixed. Obviously if they trust them then why shouldn't you. Plus they've been in business for so long.   Don't be put off by the location! Great store. Great prices. GREAT staff.
