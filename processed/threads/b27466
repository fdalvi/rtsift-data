1 10-1-13 ~ My friend and I took our 4 boys (ages 4-7) here to try out a karate lesson... Pros: cheap price $69 for six weeks including uniform, nice soft tumbling style mats and close to Costco. Cons: all levels were mixed together therefore our boys were totally lost, there seemed to be zero structure. This might be a good place if you know karate but not for a beginner. Unfortunately will not be returning... :-(
5 It's like a family here everyone treats you with great respect and very professional!! My kids learn so much from them and they have learned a whole lot of great defense moves!
5 It's a great atmosphere they make sure my kids are not only doing well in this class but in school and life in general. They are genuinely concerned about the children's well being, I love it here!!
