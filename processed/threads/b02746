1 THEY SUCK!  Return policy is terrible.  Go to Nordstroms and buy your sun glasses.  Anything and I mean ANYTHING goes wrong Nordstroms doesn't even blink!  They will Refund or exchange your money.   Sunglass Hut SUCKS!!  I went to exchange my Rayban's because an arm fell apart.  They said the best we can do is 50% off.  Nordstroms ended up giving me 100%!!!!  I didn't even purchase the glasses at Nordstroms but they had sold them at one time so they were still in their inventory.
4 Friendly service both times I've been here. Nice selection and decent prices considering the high end sunglasses. I like this location compared to the other ones. Would recommend stopping in! Bonus, you don't get troubled if you want to return a product, and the 90-day return with reciept period is generous. Nice bonus to have if you decide you don't like what you bought!
1 I purchased a pair of glasses for an upcoming road trip. In store service went well.  Returned 30 min later to price match from a store in the mall ($40 cheaper) and they refused, saying it wasn't the same glasses (same model# and everything)  I also purchased a gift card for my wife, the card was never activated. We called customer service and they said we had to go to the store we purchased the card from. We made the 40 mile drive and the sales person refused to help us because they were too busy with customers on the floor. She said she would call us back the next day (3 days later no call). I called customer service again and now they are saying they have to verify with the store (although I have a receipt with receipt#). This is BS!! I'm calling my Credit card to file a claim! Never shopping SunglassHut again!
