5 One Stop Voice has awesome customer service!
1 Hands down the biggest rip off I have ever experienced.  Service is awful, half the time my phone wouldn't ring.  The owner told me I'd be better off cutting ties with the company and finding another company that could satisfy my needs so that is what i did and switched to http://www.phonepower.com awesome service never an issue and $5/month.  Not to mention after the owner Josh (who is the only positive comment on here) is using his dad's law firm to try and sue me, not exactly great customer service
1 Worse customer service ever, the only other review is from the owner Joshua Simon.  His dad is a lawyer and will try to sue you once they don't live up to what they promise.  They are a total rip off.  Go to phonepower.com been with them since I switched and not 1 problem and have saved thousands of dollars
5 Thank you to Leor and Zach for the wonderful service you provided to JC Printing  - Phoenix on our new phone system. It has been one year since install (2-2013) and besides saving a nice chunk of change the telephone support is quick and easy.
