4 My mainstay of food has changed drastically within the last month or two my food intake has relied mainly on take out of my favorites and fast food.  If I do review fast food it is not the food I am reviewing because there is a standard of quality that must be maintained or the standard of the fast food chain will be compromised however that changes within the management of each chain.    Whew with that said, The quality of every meal I get here is excellent as far as fast food goes.  However the quality of customer service goes above and beyond.  They are super nice in the speaker always polite and the order is also correct as well as the side/sauces!  I am always happy and happy to be happy in the speaker and at the window to the employees because they are so nice!  I will continue to eat here because I have never had a problem and the employees are so extremely NICE whats up?! Thank you...
1 With 580 calories (per tacobell.com) and at ~5 USD for a steak Cantina bowl, this bowl consisted of a bit of romaine lettuce sitting on top of rice, bean, corn and very sad looking brown pieces of steak dressed in an avocado tomatillo dressing. You are MUCH better off going a little farther down the road to Chipotle and get a steak bowl there, with ~650 calories and a dollar more, you'd get much fresher ingredients and deliciousness. I wouldn't recommend Taco Bell's Cantina bowl to anyone who has any bud tastes at all.
1 Unimpressed. Service was bad, the manager couldn't speak English. He didn't know what he was doing and after a 15 minute transaction his employees had to fix the payment problem that he couldn't. I will never go to this one ever again!
