5 Like blanco but in the run. Get some queso to fuel the shopping fire.
1 I have no idea why this place has so many stars. I wish I would of just ate at amc espenade now. First, it took so long to have our waiter greet us and get our drink orders. This was my first time here, my friends had been at the original Blanco several times.  They were craving the nachos.  Now typically when a menu item has been changed either your server will tell you or the menu will state the change.  Neither happened in this situation.  My friends didn't like the taste of the nachos and they specifically asked for no cream on them.  It came with cream on the bottom and both girls are lactose intolerant.  This ruined the dinner. The nachos were sent back and my friends had upset stomachs the rest of the night.  My meal was the short rib tacos.  These were actually good but this is AZ and good tacos are expected anywhere.  They claimed I was getting borracho beans. These beans were just refried and not smashed all the way.  I will not be reccomending this place and to have a restaurant in such a nice location you have to really step up your game Blanco
4 It has taken a while for me to review on my experience but I will say over all it always has been a pleasure. My rating is mainly on service. I have only had chips and salsa along with drinks. My first time I ate my snack and drink was in the small dining area out side the little shop. The staff is friendly. This is actually my little stop for a quick drink. The infused flavored water is the best. Daily fresh fruit infused in the water is mighty tasty. I hope to be back soon to try the rest of the menu.
