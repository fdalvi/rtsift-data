1 It's been two years since I stepped foot in this place, which as coincidence would have it, was both the first and the last time.   IIRC, it's 18 and up but you can get a hand stamp or wrist band if you want to drink the Devil's sweet, sweet nectar.     Lots of punk kids in here playing pool, I felt like a damn grandpa.  Might be cool if you really like pool, or want to prey upon fresh nubile 18yo pool hall skanks.
3 It was nice they had a smoking and non-smoking section, but like others have said, it has a lot of teeny-boppers, not quite my scene, but I guess to each their own. Waitress was attentive, but they take your beer (no exceptions) at 2am when they close. Price to play was alright, but their 'sex on the beach' got me sick that night...maybe it wil be better the next time I go.
4 Visiting the family in Gilbert, da momma, baby brother and I came here to shoot a little pool.  By "da momma", I'm actually talking about my mother.  And by "baby brother", I'm actually referring to my younger brother.  I love pool by the hour, and at $8 per hour, the rate was good.  They serve typical pizza/wings/cheesesticks-type food, as well as drinks.  I had Heineken and it was cold and tasty.  Waitresses were attentive and friendly.  My moms surprised me; she's quite the shark.  And baby bro didn't do so bad himself.  We spent a good two hours in there, between 7:30 and 9:30 on a Saturday night, and had a good time.  It's 18 and up, so there are some young'uns in there, as well as people who are old enough to drink.  There were also a lot of couples there; it seems like quite the date-place.  All in all, if you're with family-style mixed company like I was, it's a fun spot to visit.
1 Lazy Q CLOSED in 2010.  New Owners cleaned up the place and its called JESTERS BILLIARDS.  Tons of beer, AC smoking patio with pool tables.  Re-did tables and got new cues.  Its rockin now.
