3 WOW!!! That was a WHOLE LOTTA food for an ITTY BITTY price.   After driving past this place a gazillion times, I decided to pick up some take out from them for dinner last night.   There was nothing skimpy about the portions. We ordered super nachos, carne asada quesadillas, rolled tacos and a chimichanga...I am not sure what I was thinking when we ordered that much, but for $25 I think I must've had 'Taco Bell' portions somewhere in mind (usually the boy can put away about $20-25 of Taco Bell all by his lonesome). Um no. I'll have to remember that next time. We will definitely be back. I think the rolled tacos were my favorite.  And the customer service was also pretty cool. Everything we ordered looked very much like the picture on the menu...and you KNOW that's a rare treat nowadays. They even took the top off of my manzanita for me and gave us plenty of salsa and salsa verde!
4 Alright, so I have now experienced several different items on the menu (this has become Mr. Tyger's FAVORITE restaurant, so he requests it almost daily *smh*...variety is NOT a dirty word!)   While the rolled tacos were yummy, I have to take a moment to highly suggest the chicken tacos...as a valid option for hangover food. Not that I would EVER get hungover *glancing upwards to see if lightning is going to strike me again today*...but if I were to do so, the grilled yumminess of their chicken taco is enough to calm my angry innards and outards so I can buffer the tylenol/aleve/aspirin/advil cocktail before passing back out into delightful oblivion.  Mmmmm tacos.....zzzzzzzzzz....
4 Have been eating their Carne Asada Burritos and Tacos since they were on 7st and Mountain View and have yet to have anything better...
