5 If you've looked at my other reviews, you'll see that the only time I take time to write is when we run into what we consider exceptional service. This was no exception.  We purchased a house with a twelve foot long verticle blind on the slider.  The slats would turn but we couldn't get it to budge on the headrail.  After about six frustrating calls, we finally hit upon Clearco.  I guess their primary business may be window cleaning but they were perfect for our needs.  The technician as Kirby . . . he was prompt, courteous and almost apologetic that he solved our problem in about five minutes. If you are looking for someone to help you with a stubborn bilnd or shade, look no further . . . Kirby's your guy!
1 Clearco is a Internet-based world class ripoff.  We have a one story house. They quoted $270 for inside and out which we agreed to pay even though it was higher than other services we used. Two high school kids came out. Their bill added $135.00 more for a "tall ladder."  We asked them to wash the two mirrors in the house. They refused.
3 Make sure you have Josh do a walk through and acknowledge any hard water spots, as they charge extra for this.
5 We recently had Clearco clean our entire house of carpeting (2500 sq feet) and our two couches. Our carpets were so bad we were thinking of ripping them all out and our couches are 10 years old and looked it. I am amazed at how both the carpets and the couches look brand new! Jacob took his time, he was meticulous - which we loved, so it took 2 days for him to do all the work. We are thrilled with the results! We also had Clearco do all our windows about 6 months ago and were extremely happy with the results. Maybe they aren't the cheapest but we've learned over the years that cheap doesn't always mean good. We paid a bit more but absolutely received our money's worth! I
