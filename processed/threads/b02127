1 Worst customer service I have ever experienced (only go if your a male). The two women who were working were gossiping about hooking up with men, while cutting these two children's hair. I told her I wanted a few high lighs to freshen my look for a wedding. That I was trying to get my hair healthy so I dont want a bunch. The woman was not friendly at all but i figured oh well its Supercuts. Once she finished putting highlights in I was spun around and saw she had put tons of right lights in. She announced it would be 85 dollars. I told her I would not pay. That if I wanted a 85 dollar color job I would have gone to my regular salon. She told me to go to the sink. Rinsed my hair aggressively and told me to leave. Refusing to give me a towel and in front of other customers just said ok leave. Will never go back. Thought I would save a few dollars and get 4-5 high lights before a wedding. Ended up spending 160 to get my tye-dyed hair fixed the next morning and missed my best friends wedding rehearsal. RUDE salon.. Just pay 85 and go to a nice salon that will pamper you.
3 It's Supercuts, so I can't say that my expectations were very high.    My old barber is in Tempe.  I now live in Desert Ridge.  I was in desperate need of a haircut, and since a 40 minute drive for a pretty basic haircut doesn't make much sense, I decided just to go to the chain shop right down the street from my house.  The place was empty when I arrived in the middle of the afternoon, so I immediately sat down with the "stylist" that approached the register when I entered.  She seemed warm and pleasant, but I was very tired and didn't have much to say.  What's left of my hair isn't that difficult to work with, and she did exactly what I asked for, in a very short amount of time.  While I won't call it one of my better haircuts, it certainly doesn't look bad.  Hopefully I won't wait until the last minute before my next haircut, but if I do, this place certainly works in a pinch.  Plus; $15 is pretty cheap compared to what most places charge.
4 I would always recommend asking for melony for a haircut, she's been cutting for 20 years and knows how to cut hair. I'm not too sure about others but I strongly recommend choosing her! She's cut my hair for years and I absolutely adore her.
