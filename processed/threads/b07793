4 They're hit and miss, but most times they're great.  Sometimes you hit a wing that's a little slack but I guess that's to be expected.
4 I have been there visiting my friend whose been at Coronado for almost four months,  Overall she has pretty good things to say about this facility.  I've always seen that it is clean and organized.  they seem to answer her questions pretty well and if I am there will respond to me as well with no issues.    Her major complaint is the food.  This is almost always the major complaint any health care facility.  When I have eaten with her, some days the food is better than others, so I can't disagree with her on that.
1 This place is a dump!  The aides spend more time gossiping with each other and their favorite patients, while those of us with real needs are ignored.  Often I had to beg for pain meds when they were way overdue.  This place should be closed down!
1 if there was an option to pick zero i would select it.  this place needs to be shut down.  horrible facility..dirty, food is horrible, no attention to detail, too many excuses and no one knows anything.  i would never recommend this place orthe staff.
