4 Usually don't like going for oil changes as i just want the "basic oil change",and not trying  to sell me on other things.,I can do basic filters,wipers etc on my own at a much more reasonable cost.This place was different.I was told by the friendly and professional manager [Patrick White] only of things to keep an eye on.As Heathers review indicates, fluids were topped ,interior vacuumed.windows washed and I too was in and out in 15 minutes.All for 29.95,the early bird special price [before 10am]..A painless experience and I too will be back.
4 I don't like getting oil changes. In fact, I avoid them. Not because I don't want to pay for them. Not because I am irresponsible. No. It is because I hate the whole spiel they have to give me about selling me all the other stuff and services even when I tell them no ahead of time. That part aside, I had a fantastic experience with this location. I dropped my car off, walked the block down the road, saw a client in their home, walked back and my car was done. Seeing as I dropped my car off before 10 am (Early bird special is from 7-10 am), I saved an additional 10 dollars. They vacuumed my interior and washed my windows better than the homeless guys on the corners. Yes. I shall be back and it will be before 10 am. Just please, stop trying to up-sell me. My little car doesn't need all that nonsense when it is slated for a trip to the junkyard/big sleep in the near future.
