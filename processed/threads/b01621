2 I dont really like giving bad reviews and I actually had to think long and hard about writing thisone. I enjoy the fact that is is a local business and i have taken my dog there several times, mostly as a puppy, I then switched to another groomer, Hugs n Pups.  I stopped going to this place originally because I thought the customer service was poor, they did not seem very friendly. So I started taking my shi-tsu to another groomer, I had recently moved and decided to give them another chance since they were alot closer.       My mistake, they were not very friendly, I am assuming they were very busy but please take some time for a little customer service. They also jacked my dog up! She looked horrible, Her cut is very uneven and she has some weird flop top on top of her head. Sadly I will not be returning to this local business, :(
5 We have been taking our Miniature Schnauzer to Barks N Bows at 32nd St. and Thunderbird since she was old enough to get her first grooming about 7 years ago. Abby loves to go there and we couldn't ask for better results. She looks beautiful every time she goes there. In fact she is there right now. I called at the last minute on a Saturday morning so they are working her in and they didn't have to do that. Would never even consider going anywhere else. They always get a nice tip, from a very satisfied customer.
5 I take my dog and cat to be groomed and I am always satisfied.  Andy does a very professional job.  I have been going there for about four years.
5 Service was great and my dogs looked and smelled amazing!! Low price too!!  They got the whole treatment for just $20 each. They don't accept Debit nor credit, so don't forget the cash. :)
