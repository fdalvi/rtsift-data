5 We have used this company for the past 5 years or so and used them again yesterday. Had to stop and say that they are absolutely fantastic!  They show up on time, their employees are clean and friendly and their rates just can't be beat.  I'm sure you will be as happy as we are so thanks to Sue and all the other staff members at Carefree Clarity.
5 Got an immediate response to my call with follow up. They were on time, polite, got to work. Did a beautiful job. Price was appropriate. I was very pleased and now i can see out my windows.
5 Very nice crew and excellent service today 2/11/14. They came out right away for an estimate but since is was raining that day I waited a week. Wow, my windows and screens are beautifully clean for a really, reasonable price. My windows had not been cleaned for at least 5 years and it was wonderful to see the difference. Thank you and for this price I will definitely do it more often, at least once a year!
