4 Not bad as far as supermarkets go. Big store and usually fairly quiet.  Big carpark and 24hour opening which is handy.
4 I like supermarkets. This is probably a bit weird (I like airports and service stations too, all these sorts of big buildings). Asda at the Western Harbour is pretty good - it's a reasonably modern building, so as supermarkets go almost attractive. It usually has a good selection of produce, and always has great offers on. I've never had a problem with the queues, the tills are usually manned sufficiently and the self-service moves quickly. It's also very near a bus route, which is handy when, like me, you don't have a car. Plus it's open 24/7!
4 This place is good. It's big. It's open 24 hours. It's not really near too much but it is near a bus route and has lots of parking.  Oh but Australian friends, they sell Vegemite here.   I have searched far and wide in Edinburgh to find this yeasty treat after failing to bring enough back from my last trip Down Under. Yay Asda Leith Superstore, you've made this Aussie native feel very much at home.
