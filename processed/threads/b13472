4 Nice, little family owned and operated style store. Very friendly- and when I needed to sell off some jewelry for some extra cash- they were fair and didn't make me feel like a low life thug slinging stolen wares.  As soon as the economy bounces back and I have money to spend on jewelry again- I will be buying all of my jewelry here instead of in the chain stores. I will be tken a broken engagement ring here for repair- and will let you yelpers know how they are with repairs soon.
4 Good, honest people, with a slight attitude if you aren't suited up.  A little pricey too. Got a bracelet fixed and it cost me $40. But they get the job done and I have used them a few times. They run a nice circular so if you manage to get it in your mail, it will save you a few dollars.
