5 Doodles is a pottery workshop with a real family atmosphere. If you're looking for something different to do for a children's birthday party then you can come here, buy a piece of pottery for each child and they can paint it themselves which I think is a lovely idea. Prices are very reasonable and there's plenty of pottery to choose from such as egg cups, plates, sauces, mugs, coasters and most of the small items are under Â£4.50. It's not just for children of course, you can also paint more intricate designs for bigger pieces such as vases and kitchen ware.  My friend had a pottery painting party a few years ago and it was awesome although the place we went to wasn't as nice as Doodles and I think I'll round up some friends and take a trip in here soon.
4 It seems that paint-your-own-novelty-ceramic-gift-item shops are like buses: none for miles around, then you get two at once, in Marchmont anyway.  Of the competing establishments on this street, however, my preference is for Doodles, possibly just because it was there first, and isn't part of a chain, though I do also think they have a wider range of stuff to choose from.  I came here to paint a teapot for my mother's birthday.  I'm no Picasso myself, and generally feel it is unwise to give my creativity free reign, but fortunately here the staff are very good at giving helpful advice when needed, without cramping your style.  I managed to produce something that didn't completely look like it had been done by a five year old, which was a definite achievement, and my mother managed to feign delight at the finished article, although perhaps she was just being tactful.  Anyway, Doodles is certainly a good source for that elusive item, a gift that is genuinely personal, and, since they sell all sorts of things, from napkin rings that cost about three pounds to plates, model cats and massive plant pots, you should be able to find something here whatever your budget.
