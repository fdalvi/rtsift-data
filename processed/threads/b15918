5 I've been wearing glasses and/or contacts since the 3rd grade and this is hands down the best place I've gotten my specs. I've made the mistake of going to Costco Optical for the past few years figuring I'm saving some coin, but I've paid for those glasses in other ways...  This place was not only competitive in price, but had a great selection of frames, professional and courteous service and best of all - one of the best fittings for frames I've ever had. I have a very heavy prescription and on top of that got a pretty large frame, but nevertheless, they fit easily and after 3 consecutive days I hardly feel them. This was NOT the norm for me. I usually have to wait a good week while my ears and nose get used to the new glasses, but I now know what it means to be properly fitted.
5 Very pleased with this place.  I have been wearing glasses for obver 30 years and have been to various spots for my vision needs.  I just got new insurance so decided to try a new place.  I love the people here.  They are so helpful and friendly.  The eye doctor is awesome and extremely informative.  I loved the selection of frames and the cost was quite reasonable.
