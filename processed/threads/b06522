3 Pizza's ok. Customer service is awful.
2 The place is clean and updated, which is a plus, but everything else was sort of lacking.  The service was slow, the food was mediocre.
4 Nice atmosphere, the building was converted from an old car wash. The pizza is decent. Cheeseburger pizza is our favorite, it's really really good.
