1 Called for a quote after being referred to this place by a co-worker. I spoke to a girl named Maria. Their customer service was awful. They were very rude and unprofessional. After calling over and over again, I was greeted with an attitude from the woman who answered the phone. They kept me on hold for 33 minutes and never apologized. I wouldn't trust these people with my neighbor's dog's teeth, which is a dog I want to run over with a bulldozer. This place has disgusting customer service. Recommendation DENIED.
5 I love this dentist office!  The staff is very professional the prices are affordable.  My mother was in a bad car accident and her dentures needed to be replaced.  We called the office to schedule an appointment and the staff was very friendly and efficient.  The whole process of fitting the dentures has been effortless.  This dentist truly care about the patients.  Kim who I believe is the co-owner is very gentle with my mom and showed TRUE concern.  I highly recommend this dentist to all in Vegas.  Last but not least.  My moms dentures look very NATURAL and they made sure that all of the adjustments were done properly.
1 I was really disappointed when I started doing my cleaning the water was splashing all over my face but what made me so mad was my whole back got wet with water and my hair. I told them are u serious no cleaning have I ever got and been the worst like this. Then when they started to polish my teeth to me it felt like she rushed and didn't even rise my mouth jut said thank u for come ur all done. I had a wet shirt,wet hair and things all over my face. I hate it there
