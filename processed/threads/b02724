2 Its a pizza hut what do you expect. Alot more than was delivered here. We had a party of 12 and there were 2 slices of pizza on the buffet line. The pizza was typical pizza chain fair.
1 I have to agree with the other reviewers on their views of this pizza hut. It's a real shame because a real pizza hut where that you can actually sit down and enjoy a pizza with your family is becoming a rare thing indeed. Many of them have converted to the take out/delivery only format.   I was thrilled to see a sit down pizza hut in Casa Grande. Unfortunately the service quickly tamed any excitement I was feeling over the location and style of the restaurant. Every time we eat here we are greeted by consistant rude and unprofessional service. My wife is a huge fan of pizza hut so we deal with the terrible service because we have to...it's the only pizza hut in town. If it was up to me we would stick to T and M pizza all the time and ignore this establishment entirely.
1 The staff is rude and treat the customers like an inconvenience. 2 hour delivery times?!?!?!?!? Really?
1 NEVER AGAIN!!  My Girlfriend and her family live in Casa Grande.  I was there and we ordered delivery.  I got a large pepperoni and some wings.  They have an insane delivery time...it was over an hour.  Fine, I can live with that.  However, after I took the food upstairs, and after the guy left, I noticed the pizza box was open.  I opened it all the way, and it looked like it fell on the side of the box before it was delivered.  The pizza was smashed up against the side of the box.  Not the lid...the side of the box.  Additionally, the wings looked the same.  There was sauce all up the side of the box, as if it was carried on the side.  And Mr. Delivery guy:  When I pay with a credit card, and I am required to sign, you should bring a pen.  Come on.  I will NEVER order from here again.  I should have read the reviews beforehand.
