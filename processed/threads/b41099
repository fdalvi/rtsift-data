5 I frequently visit this location and it's awesome. The staff is friendly and even helpful when I accidentally spill my drink in the store ! There are plenty of gas pumps so that even when they are busy I never have to wait.  Plethora of parking options too. I haven't had the opportunity to try the car wash yet but am very excited they have a working vacuum.  This is my morning drink stop and my late night snack spot. Love it!
4 The employees here are always friendly and so sweet to my 3.5 year old son. They have fun conversations with him and it makes his day. This is what customer services is all about and why we go back to this location.
