5 This is almost a morning or afternoon out. There is so much here. They have a great Christmas shop. There are quality plants, flowers and gardening equipment all kinds. Furniture for your garden and conservatories, interesting homeware and a bathshop. Gifts, cards and stationery and a great restaurant with nice home made soup. Farm foodhall with delicatessen is great and I like to pick up special things that i wouldn't normally find in the local supermarket.    One of the nicest things about visiting here is that you can pop in to the Edinburgh butterfly and insect world.    Dobbies are very generous, and I have collected for charity here.
3 'Big day out' sort of garden centre (site is the head office base of the UK wide chain), wide range of seasonal plants, additional large retail area of gifts, cards, garden furniture, lighting etc. Also sell fish and accessories for water features, bird seed, feeders etc and the usual tools and accessories. Lots of staff around for any assistance. Most of the retail is under cover, plants outdoors spread out over a wide area, section by section for fruit trees, annuals, shrubs, border plants and so on. Large restaurant area - good choice of cakes, hot and cold drinks, hot dishes, snacks. Occasional special offers on meals available to keep you on site and in a spending mood! Large food hall adjacent to the plant sales too - deli area, baking, fresh fruit and veg plus a large selection of frozen items - loose pack fruits, frozen pastries and veg. Some nod to local suppliers of preserves, baking, drinks and fresh goods - largely the usual brand names though, but nice environment for a browse. Butterfly World also on site is a destination on its own - family orientated attraction with creepy crawlies and interesting displays. Not the cheapest prices all round, but does have a large selection and worth a trip to view.
5 Within 5 minutes of driving I'm here.  With the revamp they've had recently and long called for it's def made a difference, just ashame that it didn't reach the till area.   Lots of plants to choose from and accessories for your outdoor space.  There is now a lakeland, cotton traders, bike shop and a few other shops in the retail village. The cafe has an outdoor space too where you can sit outside with a cuppa coffee and listen to kids screaming in the play area (you have no choice in that matter).  The cafe inside has ample seating too and a huge selection of food to feed up on.
4 This a kind of mecca for the wrinkly crowd and I can see why. The cafe is seriously good. Not cheap but very good, fresh food. I came to Dobbies for a plant and a thing to plant it into, which I found after being overwhelmed with choice. They certainly have lots to chose from BUT it seems they also have fish, outdoor pond and pet supplies, sensible clothes for the wrinkly crowd, sensible shoes for the wrinkly crowd, posh garden furniture, posh garden sheds, conservatories, candles, gifts, books, toys and an entire posh market food hall. Like Ikea for grandmas. I can see older couples would have trouble working up escape velocity from such a palace of treats. Oh, and indoor playground and Butterfly World in the same complex.  A rainy Saturday under cover with cakes, pots of tea and fancy things for all.
