1 After what I had read I expected this place to be dog friendly.  As soon as I opened the door, with leash and dog in hand, I was pointed out the door.   I'm guessing it's because they serve "people food" to ... regardless ... very disappointed ... I will not be back.
2 I actually was not impressed with In the Raw.  They have one juice made with lemon that I like, but if the place is supposed to be dog friendly, I want to bring my dog inside.  You have to tie your dog outside - I don't actully like that.  The place is okay....  **Update This place is closed.  Only the Gilbert location is open.
