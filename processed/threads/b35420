1 This place was horrible. The service was really bad because they didn't give us napkins and our food at the table came out so far apart one of us was almost finished eating. Their menu was really confusing because our waiter told us we could only order a few dishes off the menu for some reason. The appetizer was edible, but a bit too spicy for my personal taste. When my meal finally came out it had all these tiny bones still in it which was a problem because you couldn't eat it without getting a mouthful of bones that you couldn't really pick out. I will never go back again. I would give it zero stars if I could.
5 One of my favorite restaurants in KW. The dishes are from Xinjiang, so it's more cumin, lamb, and thick noodles than at other Chinese places.  Many (all?) of their noodles are handmade. They excellent, though very long in some dishes. Preferring spicy food, I don't have any problems with any of their dishes and find them to be of a good heat.  Aside from the noodle dishes, I would recommend the lamb dumpling that come in a soup - also a favorite of mine.  They are a bit small and out of the way, but the food is well worth the trip.
5 I have been there once and now it's one of my favorite restaurants in Waterloo! An Asian friend suggested Bogda to me. Being Turkish (from Turkey) I was curious about Uyghur food so I went there with a French and a Turkish friend. We all loved the food. We ordered dapanji, kebab and polo, and all were very tasty. I'm not big on noodles but my Asian friend loves the Bogda noodles. Apparently, they make the noodles themselves. I myself liked the kebab and polo the most, they were very close to traditional Turkish food. My French friend said it was the best kebab he had. We'll definitely be back!
