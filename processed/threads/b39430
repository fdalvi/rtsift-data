2 Well shit, all good things must come to an end and I suppose favorite Indian restaurants are no exception. Maharana, isnt entirely bad ( good service, clean space food entirely worth 2 stars) but absolutely make no mistake, this place is not as good as the place that was here, that rhymes with Maharana. Its very obvious they are cutting corners on ingredients where previous restaurant may not have. Oddly enough we really noticed in the desserts. Rice pudding a little to cloyingly sweet, Gulab oddly metallic flavored. What was offered on the rest of the buffet was good, but again just a little less richly flavored than our party had been accustomed to. I hate to say it, but we will be moving on from our regular stop here. I hear there are a fair amount of Indian restaurants in Madison! I
3 This place was really just okay.  Service was okay. Could have been better but it was decent. I was rather disappointed with the naan. It was super salty and I was pretty close to sending it back but I preserved and finished it. My eggplant dish was good. And there was plenty of rice to go around.  They deliver around Madison, which is a plus.
