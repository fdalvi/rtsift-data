1 What a horrible place. Low class and higher than expected prices. The lady that I spoke with was rude and frankly disagreed with everything I said. She wouldn't leave me alone either. When she told me that I was stupid I had had enough and just walked out.
1 Bought a sectional approx two weeks ago, was told it was new and when it was delivered 2 days late we found a big hole on the back, call and informed them of this and the said they would out someone to take a look at it, guy heads a few days later looks at it pull out some crazy glue and says as good as new. I laughed an said that's how you repair a 2600 couch. He informed me it was. I called the store a and got the runaround and told to call back in three days when the manager was in. He told me he would swap it out for another one they had on the floor. I said I wanted a new one, he said its only ben on the floor for two days wife said OK, received it cushions are all different firmness snags in it, looks worse than the ten year old couch we replaced and for $2600
1 Don't bother.  Went there at 6:55 on a Friday night.  Walked into the store as we started looking at a sectional guy yelled from the back, we are closes.  Apparently they don't want me $2000.00.  Door says they close at 7 which is still pretty early for a Friday night.  But even worse when you consider we still have 5 minutes to go.  Prices looked pretty expensive as well.
