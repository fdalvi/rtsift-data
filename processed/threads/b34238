5 LOVE, LOVE, LOVE our new pool fence! It is one of the removable types, so I can have it up when I need it or down when I don't. The fence looks great,  helps safeguard the pool, and was a great price. To top it all off, the owner, Owen Moorhead, and his son are absolutely top notch people! They are friendly, conscientious and have integrity. I would be willing to do business with them anytime!
5 Just got my new Sure Guard pool fence today. Looks great! Did a clean and professional job installing it! Very nice people to work with. Would highly recommend this company if you are in the market for a pool fence!
5 Great pool fence! Stylish and secure. Installed with the utmost care are professionalism. Quick response from the time we called for a quote, decided in the fence and install. Great company to work with!
5 Got a mesh fence installed with Sure Guard. Great product just as they described when they gave an estimate. But even better service - Owen explained all the details and got the job done on time. Like that it is family owned and operated.
