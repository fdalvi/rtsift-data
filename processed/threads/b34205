5 I found this company on Superpages.com where they had 5 stars. They provided the very best pool cleaning bid for our HOA and included more frequent services than the other companies who bid. This is a family business. The mother, Sheila works the office. She responds quickly by phone or email.I loved dealing with her. She's professional and detail oriented. This is a reliable small business that really cares about their work!
5 Had some serious issues with my pool earlier this year. Called 3 company's to come and look at it and only one actually answered the phone. So shiela and I discussed cost and schedule. They were able to make it out quickly and get the process of making my pool blue again. They have done an amazing job and any time I have questions they are always available to answer my questions. I have referred them to everybody I know and would highly suggest issuing them if your looking for an honest company that actually cares about your pool.
5 When I bought my house they were already taking care of the pool. Everyone who comes to visit compliments the maintenance of my swimming pool. They are very responsive, professional and friendly!  Thank you guys
5 SOS is locally owned pool service provider in Arizona.  I personally use them for my rental property, my personal pool and refer them to my real estate clients.  They provide competitive pricing and great service.  They are friendly and easy to work with.  If you need a company that does quality work call SOS.
