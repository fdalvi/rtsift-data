1 This office is closed !!! No warning, just closed. Had to call three different places to find out what happened and what would happen with my records. The phone has been disconnected.
1 I have been trying to get a hold of our doctor for a couple days and was wondering what was going on. Anyone know anything?
1 First off, if you want to know why he is closed, it's because his office and assets were seized. Here are the legal documents from Maricopa County:  http://www.sunvalleymedicalgroup.com/  Click the links on the website to pull up the pdf copies.  Now, this is to help anyone looking for info on what to do and how to go about collecting your records now that the office is closed:  I spoke to a representative of the Arizona Medical Association about 5 minutes ago and this is what she said to do  1) Send a letter to the closed office requesting them. If the office set a forwarding address, the letter will go there.  2) Call the state Osteopathic Board and find out what is going on and how to get your info. 480 657 7703  3) Call the AZ Osteopathic Medical Association and do the same. 602 266 6699.  Huge inconvenience he caused for everyone! It's a shame too, because I liked Dr. Degroot a lot.
