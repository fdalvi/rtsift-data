5 I have a soft spot for Veteran's.  My father served our country in WWII and Korea.  My oldest brother served 20+ years in the Air Force including service in the middle east wars.  I'll avoid the standing on the sop box by simply saying if there's anything within my power i can do to assist current members of the Armed Services and Veterans, I'm there.  Back in December, I received a note from one of my FB friends advising she's volunteering at a luncheon for Veteran's at Veteran's Village - a new hotel property that focuses on assisting Veteran's.  I signed up for the event.  At the event I was given a tour of the property by the property director, Arnold Stalk.  I was awestruck by Mr. Stalk's vision for the property and the incredible local support to make this "hotel" a reality.  As an example, ( and a positive attribute of Facebook), Mr. Stalk was looking for volunteers to assist in painting the hotel unit - so he posted on Facebook hoping the word will get out.  He received a response from some employees of Home Depot ( I believe they were Vets  ) and after they spent the day painting, one of the volunteers indicated they would contact Home Depot Corporate to see if they can further assist since a large portion of the hotel was in dire need of construction improvement ( it was an abandoned 120+ unit hotel in downtown so you can probably imagine the condition of the property . ) The result ? A $700,000+ grant from Home Depot to repair the property !! Another example of giving ? Sands Corp. graciously contributed hotel furniture to furnish the units.  There have been numerous charitable organizations and church groups that have contributed to VA Village to help make it a reality -God Bless America and God Bless the amazing citizens of Las Vegas that DO CARE ! ( oops, i did it, i stood on the soap box, albeit only for a second... sorry )   Back to Veteran's Village and what it's about.  Simply put, the goal is to put a roof over the heads of Veteran's.  A portion of the hotel is reserved for Vets that are simply visiting Las Vegas.  More importantly, a large portion of the property is to assist Veteran's in need.  Not only housing but they also assist veteran's to find assistance/resources, basically, to get back on their feet.  The first tenant of the hotel was a veteran, his pregnant wife and their young child.  They were homeless.  They weren't looking for pity - I believe he was actually employed at the time - they needed ( and deserved ) a helping hand.  I'm really impressed with the hotel manager, Dennis.  He is a partially disabled veteran that worked his way through the "system" to obtain his deserving government benefits after serving our country in Iraq/Afghanistan.  He bends over backwards to educate other veterans on what benefits are afforded to them.  He follows a simple philosophy," I'll work as hard for you  as you work for yourself."  Meaning - you make the effort and I'm with you every step of the way.  As of late, the word is getting out about Veteran's Village.  Local restaurants are providing food for the pantry,  local charities are bringing clothes and numerous people are volunteering their time to help the cause.  Future plans include, " sponsor a room"  where people can contribute the cost of housing a veteran at the hotel.  I try to visit Veteran's Village every other week to bring gift cards and non-perishable food.  Everytime I visit i hear about the amazing progress of this non-profit hotel and it truly warms my heart.    So if you know of a Veteran that needs housing assistance, have them call Veteran's Village.  If you have a few extra cans of tuna in the pantry, don't be shy, simply drop them off at the front desk of Veteran's Village.  if you have an extra $10, next time at Walmart or McDonalds, buy a gift card and drop it off - I promise, it will put to good use !
1 I lived here for awhile and this place is a mental health and homeless shelter as well as privite pays at the end of that are the vets. See when I lived here only about 30 or less of people where vets the rest where on a programs that where paying for their stay and then there where people who where private pay. There was very little difference between the private pays and the vets and other than the vets got weekly access to the food pantry and the rest did not except if there was a need and approveal from management.       I think the worst part of this place is the lack of actual caring from the staff that works here. They promise you heaven to keep you living in poor condition. I feel bad for the people who this is their only option of housing and they have to put up with the mistreatment by the staff here.  Steve the most abusive he acts like he owns the place and is constantly cussing at the clients and being rude. One time I was in the lobby this female tenant who was trying to be helpful to tell people that the food pantry had gotten in donations and Steve looks at her with the manger Greg standing next to him and told her to shut the hell up. Greg said nothing to him even though as far as I understand Steve is just staff and Greg is the manger. I also seen him a couple of times get into it with an old vet yelling and cussing him out. Then when the vet leaves to go back to his room Steve starts talking about how the guy is an alcoholic and if he that f***ing  miserable with his life he should just kill himself. Yet the worst I seen it and expereince it was the day I left. They had bags of food sitting out for us to take and I got one and it did not have a sandwhich in it and put it back and got one with a sandwhich and steve starts yelling at me says why you F-ing touching all of the stuff up here if you touch one take it. I had on several occians told polietly but firmly that he is not to talk to me that way and today I got harder and said F-U don't talk to me that way and he got up in my face and told me that if I said anything like that again he was going to punch and throw me threw the F-ing wall. All the while the manger is sitting behind the desk not saying are doing anything like getting in this guys face or protecting and this guy could have seriouly hurt me. This is what I mean by the staff not caring.        Like I said before they tell you a lot to get you to stay. They told me for the couple of months I was there they where going to fix the hole the wall left by a former tenant in my room never got anything fixed. I told this staff daniel about the roach problem in my room and I was given  some story that as long as it was not this center kind of roach that it was ok. Huh! I suppose to live with roaches. Also this place is infested with bed bugs but they will not tell you this while taking your money.          Also they take your money and forget to tell you that cable is about to be shut off. Also when this guy promised me for a couple of days to give me my money back started to give me a song and dance about he could not give me my money back and I was thinking crap I will be here for the rest of the month but steve who really did not like me threw in two hundred of his own money that he would get back from them to get me out.          Please read this and understand that I saw very love while there for me or the other residents. It felt like the staff had their seperate club and the truth was the last thing we got. I hope they improve this because we need more for our vets but this is like a cold hard slap for the service these people gave.
1 VV is transitional housing, but they also rent rooms to veterans by the week and month. This is for a paid stay.  Straight down to business. The good, bad, and downright ugly.  - Free food. Not referring to the pantry, there are loads of freebees. Mostly baked goods, but there are also occasional canned goods, snacks, fruits and veggies. It will slash your grocery bill considerably.  - It's cheaper than most if not all long term stay hotels in the area. The only thing that might be cheaper is a backpacker hostel, which can be an option if you don't mind having multiple roommates.  - The place has cockroaches. The problem will never be controlled as long as they spray poisons, while ignoring the cracks and gaps where cockroaches can gain entry and move around the building. If you plan on staying here, word of advice. You can take cockroaches with you when you leave. Leaving your belongings in your car on a hot Vegas summer day should kill them.  - The WiFi here is downright horrendous. It's highly unsecure because the weak encryption used lures malicious users who have gone on to attack end user systems and the routers themselves. Performance depends on typical traffic variations; fine one day/week, largely non-functional the next.  - Some of the staff are very disrespectful. One made promises she knew VV may not be able to keep (take everything the southern blonde lady says with a grain of salt), then another staff blew me off when I complained. Their maintenance man beat on my door and windows, waking me up, thinking he could kick me out of my parking spot so he and his buddies could have some sort of get together in the parking lot. They entered my room while I was away, claiming it was legal. Just who do the fudge do these people think they are?  It's cheap but there are some serious tradeoffs. I left this place and went back to living in my car. It wasn't an easy decision to make, but it had to be done. This place was dragging me down with it. There are better long term hotels in area, and they don't cost that much more.
