5 Outstanding paintball experience.  Super excellent customer service. We brought two adults and 6 kids for my son's13th birthday party. Henry went out of his way from the first phone call to insure we would have a great party. Most reasonably priced experience in the valley as compared to Cowtown or Splatter ranch. The trenching was a bonus feature to fight in. Their local rule of head, chest or back shots being the only that take you out of the game made the fight more realistic. The refs were super attentive and flexible concerning game set up. So appreciated the 5 diverse fields and ability for us to have our own field for private play. This is how a recreational business should be run. The competitors should take lessons because now this is the only field we will be playing on.
5 I can only compare to one paintball park, Paintball At Vogelweh R&G Club. So far the 2 times here it was a ton of fun. Divided by fields and one of them is huge with broke down helicopter, busses, etc. Highly recommend!
5 Best paintball park in Arizona. So many fields and great staff. Love this place!
5 Our first visit. I brought my teen and a bunch of his friends. I played also, though was mostly  target practice :) The owner is very cool. The playing fields are awesome with cars, a helicopter and buildings. It's well organized and all the rental gear worked great.
5 As an seasoned paintballer for over 7 years. I've been around a numerous amount of parks both in Arizona and beyond. From SC Village to West World paintball, this park easily has my heart. The staff is experienced in both customer service, and their equipment, and on top of it all? They are knowledgable about the sport! Not to mention the fields allow for absolutely anybody to pick up and play- I recommend this park to anyone looking to try out the sport- or for the experienced looking to sharpen their skill. This is your park. I'll see you on the field.
