4 For those of you who like hitting things with sticks to make loud noises, then this is the place to go.  They have an amazing selection of different brands, cymbals, accessories, sticks and well, drums. The shop often has sales on so you can get some good deals on a lot of items. The staff are great, obviously really into music and great at recommending things to suit your needs. This shop is probably Edinburgh's best drum shop as it is devoted purely to drums so it has the largest selection. Worth a visit for any drummer.
5 Drum Central is a complete must see for all drumming enthusiasts. The shop has an extremely extensive selection of different drums including Pearl, Sabian, Pro Mark and Remo. You name it, they have got it! They also sell drums for pipe bands and have a huge range of different cymbals, drum sticks and bass pedals. Drum Central have a vast range of drumming accessories such as gloves, earphones, clamps and amplifiers. Bongos, tambourines and conga's are also for sale.   The prices are very wide ranging in this shop, with a full drum set available from about £250 to £750. The staff in Drum Central are highly knowledgeable about everything drum related and are happy to suggest which drums would best suit what a customer is after. Drum Central is extremely well equipped and is definitely the place for all drummers to go.
5 Oh I hate this shop. I don't at all, I love it. And that's why I hate it. It's amazing. It's a feast for the eyes and ears and I want everything in it. I should probably add at this point that I am a drummer, I've not just gone some weird drum fetish.   I've been here many times over the past few years. I bought my cajon here (look it up), a case for my djembe, cowbells, shakers, drum sticks. I nearly bought a singing bowl for an impulse buying competition but decided against it at the last minute. They sell the lot, and it's really not expensive either. The shop is split in two rooms, one selling kits, the other selling more world percussion. The in-store stock is impressive, but if they don't have it then they'll order it in for you.  The guys who run the place are really cool too, I could chat drums with them for hours. I'm running out of superlatives. Just go, alright?
