4 Wow!!!!! Everything fit like a glove!!!!!!!! No falling down pants here.....they were so nice honest and helpful in piecing together my workout clothes!!! I can't wait for their trunk show at Kinesis Konnection!
4 So amazing!  LJ Staff came to our studio and held a "Trunk Show".  The staff is incredible, confident, and knowledgeable about the material and cuts of all the clothes.  LJ is an amazing concept, comfortable fit, bright, bold, and FUN.
4 Lorna Jane store is a cute trendy sporty little store packed with lots off workout goodies. I am not only impressed by the quality of her clothing but the variety of unique colors and options to choose from. There is something there for anyone looking to look and feel great during their workout. In the back of the store is a full studio that had a class going on. You can tell the brand is passionate about their clients since a healthy lifestyle is promoted for the clients. It appears based on the sign at the door that classes take place throughout the week. I was immediately greeted by Bianca who was high energy and super friendly. She did at first  come across a little to pushy in trying to get a sale but I have to say she does mean well. She truly is passionate about the brand and knows her stuff. I will be back again as I am in love with the bright colors and designs. They are not like other brands nor is the quality. The 3/4 quarters pants were so soft. This brand is a must have to my wardrobe.
