4 For those times you just want to avoid the post office chaos, come here for your shipping needs!  It's located in a strip mall and very easy to find.  There are plenty of parking spots near their store so it won't be an issue if you have to carry in a heavy box.    I noticed many different items along the walls for sale.  It is very clean and organized for an easy find of items.  The ladies helping behind the counter are so friendly and helpful.  I was in and out in a flash. I will definitely keep them in mind especially during the busy holiday season.
