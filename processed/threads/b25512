5 I've been going to Lake Pleasant Dentistry for 2-3 years now and Dr. Sharon Bader is hands-down the best dentist I've ever had.  I've traditionally had bad experiences with dentists and am always wary of any dental procedure, but I've never felt more comfortable than with Dr. Bader.  She is very accommodating, puts you at ease, explains all the options and does GREAT work and will stand behind it.  She did a pretty complex crown for me when the tooth was borderline whether it could be saved and it worked out great.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this practice to anyone.
5 I have had horrible luck with dentists in the past...no empathy for the fact that I have very sensitive teeth to long waits to horrible prices and zero bedside manner. Dr. Bader is the best medical practioner I have ever seen, period. She is timely, kind and reasonable priced. Her entire staff is just as kind an compassionate as she is. My husband and I both enjoy going. She could teach many other providers a thing or two about client care.
5 Dr. Bader and her staff provide outstanding service and professionalism. She is definitely the best dentist I have had in my 30 years as an adult. The staff are always friendly and genuinely helpful. Every experience I've had with this office has left me feeling like I was treated and cared for as a person, not just a number or a patient. Their office also offers orthodontic care a couple days a week through visits by Dr. Shawn Bader. My son had his orthodontia from him, and our experience was equally positive.
