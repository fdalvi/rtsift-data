5 GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!  My friend had purchased some shoes here almost a year ago and when he wore them he got the worst blisters of his life!  So we found the receipt and taped back together the box and waited for our next visit here which was last week.  The manager was nice enough to let us exchange them for a different pair.  The sales associate that helped us went out of her way to be sure that we were finding everything O.K.  My friend found a pair of Caterpillar boots to exchange for the original shoes but one of the boots had a little dent on the top of it.  My friend didn't really care since they were letting us exchange the shoes and he was lucky enough for that.  But the associate found a replacement boot that wasn't dented on her own initiative.  Very cool!!!  And of course I couldn't get out of there without picking up two pairs of shoes for myself :o)
4 Came here during the holidays, on a whim- decided to check out their selection. Hush Puppies are knowsn for their comfortable shoes. Boots under $60.00, shut up! I got a pair of brown leather zip-up knee-high ones, which turned out to be more comfy than my aerosoles boots. Looks cute with skinny jeans. Lots of selections, but few were stocked in my size (an outlet problem that is very common).  Seats with mirrors in the middle. Clearance stuff in back. Clean place. Quiet. A few customers inside. Nice clerks. Quick checkout. Happy with my boots purchase.
4 I feel old just entering the store, but I don't care. It's a sensible shoe made for comfort. There's no shame in my shoe game.   I have had some achy tootsies and thought it might be smart to start looking at a more comfortable shoe instead of focusing on the cute factor when selecting my footwear. The service was friendly and very welcoming. I was approached by several salespeople. I was very impressed by the service. I didn't find anything I wanted to buy, but I will definitely be back.
