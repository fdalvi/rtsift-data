3 I had an MRI done here.  The staff was friendly.  The person who conducted the MRI was great.  He was real informative and made sure I was comfortable.  I requested a copy of the MRI to take to a doctor and they gave me a blank disc!  This is why they received 3 starts.  Overall everyone was friendly.
4 I first came in for an x-ray then had to return here to get a MRI.  Unfortunately when you go to places like these you aren't in the greatest condition or feeling your best, but the staff here made me feel comfortable and eased my nerves not once, but twice!  Everyone was friendly and extremely helpful.  Thanks West Valley Imaging !!
1 Frightful experience. The front staff was very unhelpful and gave me the wrong results and when I pointed out that I was given the results for the wrong hip, they gave me the run around and insisted they had done the reading on the correct side.  Absolutely no concern for the patient and told me to drag myself over to my primary care and have them sort it out.  My primary care doctor was appalled and promptly had the receptionist call them to insist they re-process the results on the correct hip STAT!    If you have any work done at this place, make sure you double check the results. Good thing they're not surgeons - gulp!
5 had to have an mri done here. the mri tech was super nice and let me pick my satellite radio station while doing the scan. =)
4 Yep, it's test time.  Us women know this is not our favorite way to spend an afternoon.  Good thing West Valley Imaging makes this a painless, quick procedure.  If you show up 30 minutes before your appointment like they ask you to, everything goes very smoothly and quickly. The staff are very friendly and patient.  Why not five stars you may ask? The facility is beginning to show its age just a bit. Otherwise, I have no complaints and appreciate their professionalism and good customer service.
