4 I was told that their key making skills are extraordinaire here. Just need to do something about the air in the morning. I know its Phoenix in the Fall. It still gets a lil stuffy here. Crank that AC in the morning.
4 A day full of errands is not one of my favorite ways to spend the day.  But every now and again, you gotta do what you have to do and when I need to ship a package whilst I'm on that side of town, most certainly, I'd like to stop at this UPS store to do it.    On this occasion, I was returning an online purchase.  I searched on my Yelp App to map out my stops and this UPS store turned up.  This is a typical UPS store with packaging materials for purchase and mailboxes to rent.  I was particularly happy with the service that I received from the lady who waited on me.  I arrived to the store about 3 or 4 minutes before they opened.  She saw me outside and opened the door.  I appreciated her not making me wait the 3 or 4 minutes and she let me come into the store.  She was helpful in that she reminded me that I needed to keep up with my receipt because there was no other way to prove that I dropped off the package.  Great tip for me as that receipt would have gone in receipt purgatory, my purse pocket.  A clean and well organized store.
5 Jan is extremely friendly. All the employees are very helpful. They have a computer to print from, copy machines, they laminate, make keys, mail. If you purchase something at the frys next door, they have a coupon on the back of the receipt.
