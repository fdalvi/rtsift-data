3 I'm not a big fan of Dennys but my family and I wanted to enjoy some early morning grub.  I've been to this location a few times in the past. Inside of the restaurant was very clean, quiet, and calm.  The a/c had to be set on blizzard because it was colder than polar bear toenails in that building lol.  Overall, the food was good and filling and the staff was nice. Definitely will visit again if I'm in the area.
1 dined several times, food always was just the average coffee shop meal. the last time I was there, I noticed something in my coffee, and upon further inspection, saw that it was a baby cockroach. DO NOT EAT HERE! if there's one, there's more! when I brought it to the waiters attention, he quickly picked up my cup and ever so quietly whisked it away and brought me a new fresh cup. needless to say, I exited before my meal even came.
1 Just keep driving and hit up IHOP, it's literally 30 seconds away from this Denny's.  I am actually a Denny's fan. When I am in the mood for something that is full of calories and eggs that are stuffed with meat and cheese, Denny's is a good place to come. It's great for eating after you've been drinking and it's good for a breakfast, just because you want to have a huge Grand Slam breakfast.  Unfortunately this Denny's is really sub-par, and I know, I know - it's Denny's! But still. The place is always super crowded and the waiters always seem on the verge of having mental break downs. They often forget items or don't have the food brought out correctly (ie: my boyfriend always orders things without onions and here they always manage to leave them on).   Plus, I think Denny's is over-pricing its food now-a-days. Unless you go for their specials such as the breakfast slams you might as well go eat somewhere else and get better food for a better price. I paid $9.99 for an "okay" buffalo chicken sandwich. When I pay almost $10 for a sandwich, I want it to be spectacular.   Just not worth it.
1 It should be half a star.   My order came completely wrong and tasted like day old leftovers reheated in a microwave.   Waitress never asked about the meal, manager only cared about the bill. So as a disabled marine, i quietly paid & left.   Hence this mention on yelp, twitter, & to their corporate.  Everyone, do not eat at dennys, the food was horrible and the customer service was like the dmv.   Cold and uncaring.
3 Good food, good service. No complaints.
3 Ehhh pancakes, eggs, hashbrowns and fruit and a hot chocolate....'nuff said.
3 Food always good here.
3 They no longer have their "old favorite" roast beef with gravy, but they replaced it with something similar. They put bread on a plate, then mashed potatoes, then roast beef with some veggies and pour gravy over the whole thing. It was different but it was good. I did enjoy it.
4 Don't make it too this location to often but have never had any complaints about service. People are very friendly and that makes all the difference when visiting a Denny's. Place is kept clean to include restrooms.
5 I went here for Veterans Day in order to take advantage of their all-you-can-eat pancakes for those in the military.  In terms of food quality: well, it's Denny's, and this restaurant chain is the same everywhere else. I never had any problems with my order or the quality of taste at this location. The waitress that served me was nice and attentive.  Currently, Denny's is doing yet another Hobbit promotion, so if you love Tolkien's work, do dig in to their special Hobbit-themed menu. It's limited edition and the price is worth if for what they offer.  Oh, and speaking of Veterans Day: Denny's *always* offers a 10% military discount to active, reserve, and retired servicemen as well as their dependents. My family always makes sure to ask the waiters for this whenever we eat at Denny's, so don't be afraid to ask if you are in the military as well.
5 Micheal was very nice. He gave us a lot of attention.  Very nice to my kids. ;) ;) ;) ;) ;)
4 We came here after a stress-filled morning and were pleasantly surprised. This Denny's is nothing like the one we'd been to previously. The cook actually did a great job, the service was spot-on and the waitress was awesome.
