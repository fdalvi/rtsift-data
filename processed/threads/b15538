1 Very bad service. They don't show up and are difficult to reach. Do not risk using these for your pool !
2 I used them for over two years and here is my review.  They were reliable for the majority of the time I used their service.  Billing, on the other hand, has been a nightmare.  As soon as there is an issue, the lovely person who handles that for them is rude and generally clueless.  The owner is a nice guy and I would still recommend him is you need a one time service based solely on the quality of work, but stay away from their monthly service and stay far, far away from their bookkeeping lady.
1 I used them for more than a year. They didn't show up half the time, and when my solar heater developed a leak they claimed they couldn't clean the pool at all (I suppose that using the shutoff valve never occurred to them). They continued to collect my money but not clean the pool. They charged me $25 extra whenever they cleaned the filter (a no-extra-cost item with my current service), never told me in advance when they were going to do it, and demanded payment for it on the spot before they left.
