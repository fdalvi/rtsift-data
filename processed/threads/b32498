5 Great Studio with a great staff!! Very friendly and productive atmosphere!! Music and Dance lessons are offered, go in and check them out!!
5 Hunnie Bunnie's Godmother bought her dance lessons here for her fourth birthday. She absolutely loves dance class and the instructors here are all very nice and patient. Dance lessons go on for an entire years with two recitals and a couple of breaks in between. They are pretty strict on not missing any classes but if you do have to, they have make up classes available. We will definitely continue to go here!
5 My goddaughter goes to dance class here and she loves it!  Watching her makes my heart melt.  At 4 years old, it's amazing to me some of the stuff she's learning.  I love it when I get to bring her to class. Fun times!  The teachers all seem really great and nice!
