5 Very professional agency with great customer service. They represent multiple insurance companies, saved me over $600 a year. I have referred a lot friends to them, I recommend to stop by for a quote. Javier. S
5 A true Insurance Brokerage with excellent customer service. I was tired of paying $160 a month of insurance for a beat up 98 Honda... Went to GLG and had Anna worked me up a few quotes. I was shocked at the savings but super happy that I finally had a company that would do the work to save me money!!! I have better coverage and a lower payment... She also was knowledgeable and eager to help me set up my life insurance. I am not only pleased with their services but also with their willingness to help. Thanks GLG for your help.
5 Highly recommend for all insurance needs. Very friendly staff and have great variety of insurance companies to deal with to get the best prices for auto, home and business insurance.  I wouldn't go anywhere else for any of my insurance needs in Las Vegas!
