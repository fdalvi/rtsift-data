4 I was helping a friend whose sister had passed away and saw them handle the estate after her death and I have to say that it was a good experience. Their office was close in Summerlin and comfortable and they took the time to walk through the process so the family was happy. Good guys who know their stuff but not the uptight kind that keeps you away from attorneys. The bad was that the office was nice but it was a bit hard to find, but definitely reccomend.
5 I was recently involved in a business transaction that I never before encountered. Cooper Coons, Ltd was able to guide me through the legal implications of the deal and answer any questions I had. In addition, they promptly drafted a contract that adequately protected my business interest. They were extremely responsive and the deal went off without a hitch. I highly recommend this firm to anyone who is looking for capable attorneys with knowledge and a professional touch.
5 All I can say is that my experience at Cooper Coons was excellent. They took care of my trust and I knew I was in good hands! I would and will recommend them to everyone!
5 I've used Cooper|Coons personally to set up and manage my Trust as well as my Mother's Trust. Additionally, I've referred their office more times that I can count and every time my clients have thanked me for the referral because they had the same great experience. Hiring an attorney can be daunting and expensive. I find most attorneys lack customer service and personal attention. Cooper|Coons has always exceeded expectations and have always been my go-to!
