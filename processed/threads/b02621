5 Excellent, friendly service for a great price. I brought my shoes in and 2 days later they looked BRAND NEW. I would highly recommend this place. They're just 1/2 block south of Main St. by the Nile.
5 I love this place! Fabian is so reasonable , quick and reliable. I bring all my shoes luggage, briefcase and boots and belts to him for repair. I highly recommend them!
5 Fabian was so helpful for an emergency boot repair. Five star repair. Reasonable price! Thanks !
5 Lamb's is great. Fabian is helpful and skilled. Combatting our throw-away culture one shoe repair at a time.
