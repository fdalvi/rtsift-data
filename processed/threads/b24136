4 Large thrift store near East Town Mall. Lots of clothing, housewares, and jewelry. Fairly clean and well organized by color and size, but you still have to dig because it is a thrift store! They have a decent sized vintage clothing section. I've found some good vintage dresses here to re-purpose. I've also found licensed UW hockey jerseys here for $4. It's also a popular stop for Halloween costumes.  Thursday to Sunday they designate one color of tag 50% off, then on Monday that color tag is only $1. Cheap!
4 Typical Savers except this one is packed with stuff Madison people use. Small towns with educated healthy populations make for great thrift stores .......  I won't tell you my secrets!!!!!!!!!!!!
4 Wow. Having neve been in this location of Savers before I was amazed at how well they have transformed the old Gander Mountain space. No cramped, hard-to-squeeze-through aisles or piled up merchandise. The store is really well laid out and the store associates were more than helpful when I came in looking for something specific - the friendly greeter at the door pointed me right where to go.  Also, they did a great deal on a bulk purchase (I might've cleaned them out of vintage china plates...). An excellent thrifting experience.
4 Well organized by item type and size. I found a great blazer from the Gap for $6.99! It takes a while to look through everything. Go with a plan on what you're looking for! Many items are lower level name brands (e.g. Target and JC Penny), but if you look hard enough you will find some hidden gems!
1 Way to expensive for being a thrift store. If i wanted to pay $8 for a kids shirt i would by it new at Walmart.
