4 Ok, so I'm hispanic and live in Surprise, AZ so the reason for the 4 stars is because I have a couple of Tia's who are amazzzzing cooks. It's hard if not impossible for any Mexican restaurant to earn 5 stars from me. I love this place so much though that they know my family by name and greet me like I'm their long lost cousin - again I think it's a Hispanic thing.   Ok so the restaurant itself looks a little like the meeting place for the Mexican Mafia but I never eat inside, so moving on. They make everything fresh so you might have to wait 10-15 minutes if you order drive-thru but trust me; it's worth every second of your waiting. Their menu is basic but delightful. I usually get the machaca and egg burro but will sometimes mix it up with the breakfast burrito of egg, cheese, and bacon. Their salsa is very good and is great on anything. Skip on the guac..looks a little like runny slime. The flautas are delicioso and so is the carnitas. They serve menudo and sell fantastic tamales at Christmas time. The prices are great and they are open 24 hours - JACKPOT!   If you are lucky, you might spot Alfredo walking around with a cowboy hat and cookin it up in the back for you. I love this place so much my family paid for a couple of burritos for me in advance for my birthday! I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone.
4 Very friendly. Alfredo is the owners father so shout out to him. Good food. Good price.
5 You can't beat the prices, and the food is excellent. Like any place that makes your food as you order it - it takes a while, but that's the (in this case low) price you pay for really good authentic food. If you want a fast drive thru, go to the crappy Taco Bells of the world.
1 I first tried this restaurant in May and I have to say i did enjoy it.  Now that i'm on the other side of surprise i can see myself frequenting this restaurant more.  UPDATE: Sadly This restaurant is closed, gone, DONE.
