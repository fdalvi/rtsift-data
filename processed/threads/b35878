5 I order the rice and noodles and loved it. This is some of the best tasting Chinese food I've had and it's cooked fresh. Not what I'd expect to find in a mall food court.
4 Everything is made fresh to order rather than sitting in hot plates waiting to be served, and the portion sizes are intimidating for many of the dishes. Not the typical mall food court place, definitely where I go when I'm here.
4 This place is a guilty pleasure, found in the most unlikely place--a food court in a mall? Whodathunk. Not gourmet by any means, but its greasy goodness that pleases every time.  The portions are generous and the turnaround is fast. I especially love their singapore rice noodles. Flavors are there, coated in oily wok goodness.   Another surprise is the shrimp they use in their dishes --theyre huge!  Youd expect dinky little shrimp for a fast food place but their shrimp are quite plump and large!  Ive never tried anything else in the food court.  I like this booth too much!
5 It has been months sice we last ate there and the food is still just as good. They have this ice tea drink that has a mochi like bubbles on the bottom. It is different but very good.
2 Food is covered in grease. It's dim sum in a mall, so don't really expect much unless you absolutely need a dim sum fix. Overall the food is a little bland.  The staff is friendly and they have a decent variety, but if you're a dim sum fanatic, this spot isn't for you.
