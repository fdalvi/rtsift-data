3 This is the first Indian grocer I've been to in Las Vegas.  It is big and fairly clean.  The guys working there are very friendly.  The selection is decent - though for some of my spices I'll probably be going to one of the Asian groceries which have more selection and offer smaller quantities.  There were some large industrial sized bags and containers here, I wouldn't be surprised if they supply some of the local restaurants.    The fresh produce was limited and nothing really caught my eye.    If you've never wandered down the aisles of an Indian grocery store then you can't go wrong here, it's a great experience.  I will be going back.
4 I collect images, pujas and statues of the Hindu god Ganesha.  I stumbles upon this place after eating at Rasin' Cain a few feet from here.  They have an excellent collection of clothing , jewelery and Hindu religious items to sell. It is great it is so centrally located rather than some place far out of town.
5 Woah, dated an indian girl so whenver her folks were in town, I'd go pick up some dessert from here - especially the somosas. Woah, they were good.
