1 The last time I visited Burke Veterinary hospital was a few years ago. But since I was reviewing Vets I thought I would include this place. Anyways, what stands out in my mind was the fact that the veterinarian seemed very aloof and almost arrogant. That was enough to turn me away permanently.
1 Well, I ended up taking the dogs here after first moving to Phoenix because they took our pet insurance. What a mistake. After running a barrage of expensive tests on our one dog, she still couldn't figure out what was wrong. (Second vet diagnosed correctly immediately without tests and we haven't had problems since)  Oh, and don't even get me started on how she treats staff and paying customers... I think the reason why she couldn't diagnose our dog is she really didn't give a poot to take a proper history. She seemed like there were a million places she would rather be than trying to help our animal get better.   Aside from all of that, the part that bothered me the most was that in front of us, she managed to find time to berate the receptionist for a good 10 minutes while we were waiting to be seen and raked the vet assistant over the coals in the back area (while leaving the door open so we could hear) for another five for silly little things... I don't want to do business with people who treat employees like that. Ever! Unprofessional and useless.
1 this vet is terrible! my dog was clearly sick, the vet was extremely rude, was not forthcoming with information and was extremely rude when i asked questions. my dog is a family member,  when asking questions trying to understand what was going on for treatment and prognosis, she very sarcastically said "well i have been a vet for over a week now" and was extremely unhelpful. clearly, she works with animals because she has NO PEOPLE SKILLS! I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS VET! AVOID THIS VET AT ALL COSTS! if i could have given 0 stars, i would have.
