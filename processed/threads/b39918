4 Maddie and Marks is the ultimate in kids shoe shopping. The choice of style and size/width is fantastic. My daughter always feels like a princess when we visit the shop. You are always guaranteed to find something different - they stock a great range of european makes that you just don't seem find elsewhere in Edinburgh. The downside is that you pay for the quality and choice - my purse is always very noticeable lighter after a visit. This said, you pay for what you get. However, it would be lovely if they put prices on their display shoes. One other point to note is that refunds are only given on damaged shoes. If you just change your wind you will be given a credit note. All in all, if you are a shoe-aholic (or your child is one in the making) this is the place for you.
