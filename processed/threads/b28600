5 Everything about this place is great.  Awesome staff, awesome accommodations, awesome gear, awesome atmosphere.  My band has been coming here for two years now and I would never consider going anywhere else.
4 Really nice place to set up and rehearse if your band doesn't want to infiltrate someone's den or living room. I can't speak to the recording services they offer.  The equipment in the room we used was very nice. Studio K has new Krank amplification for guitar and bass, plus a full set of drums and PA. They have lots of other misc equipment that you might not be expecting, such as guitar, keyboard, and mic stands. We were short a mic and were able to check out one from the guy at the desk with just a photo ID.  The climate is nice inside and our practice experience was very good.
5 I swear we would've paid close to three times as much in L.A. for the room and the service we had here. Thanks again
