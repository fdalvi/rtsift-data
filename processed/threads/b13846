1 They ruined my faux fur hooded jacket!!! Don't get your clothes dry cleaned here! The stains were still on my jacket after it was "cleaned" and their dryers burnt the fur of the hood!  When I went back to complain they wouldnt do anything about it and told me that it is normal for the fake fur to look like that. I've gotten it dry cleaned at other places before and this has never happened. Two different dry cleaners confirmed they ruined my jacket. DONT GO HERE!!!!
1 I do not believe that this is a good dry cleaners.  If you want to find out, then go and hopefully you have a better experience.  The left a stain on my collared shirt and all of my white collared shirts then cleaned but didn't iron.  They were all super wrinkled when I got them back.  Some sort of weird joke?
