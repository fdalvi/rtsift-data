5 Its a Walgreens!
4 Oh Walgreens. You have [nearly] everything I need for my health: first aid, pharmacy, bath and body products, cheap makeup...but for some reason you don't sell EAS Myoplex.   Walgreens is a little kid's paradise, with an expansive candy aisle, snack selection, flimsy toys and little gadgets.   Need some wine?  Walgreens sells wine. And some beer. This is unheard of in Colorado.   Sometimes checking out is painstakingly slow...other times it's quite speedy. You never know what new things you'll walk out with.
