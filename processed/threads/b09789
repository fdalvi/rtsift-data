1 Nasty
5 Love this store an their new location , Bigger Better and a lot more space !! The new staff is awesome and love the new manager wayyyy better than the old one !!! Always great CLEAN stuff and 10times better than the 17 and bell location !!!
2 No organization at all!!! Everything is out of place. You can find much better deals at goodwill!!!
5 I love this store! They have everything for the whole family, plus stuff for the house! They are less expensive than the other resale shops. Way more selection too!
4 Good selection and price for soon to be parents (I guess all parents really).  I definitely recommend this place over Goodwill.
