4 = = = = = = THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE KFC DAILY BUFFET! = = = = = =  Ever wish you could go to a KFC & be able to eat all you want of everything for one low price?  Well, your wish has come true!  Just wheel down to this KFC, where they serve up 28 trays (plus dressings & sauces) of all the delicious chicken & everything else they carry, every day from 10 AM to 7 PM, with their all-you-can-eat buffet!  Mike C. & I whipped down there today & pigged out on all the great chicken varieties, mashed potatoes & gravy, fried okra, corn fritters, cole slaw, hot apple pie, & much more.  This is a serious feast for only $7.59/$6.59 Sr.!    :-))

4 = = = = = = KFC DAILY BUFFET! = = = = = =  Wow, it's been almost two years since getting around to this one, & that's too long!  So today, joined by Arlin B. & Mike C. it was a trip back down here for an amazing feast of fried & BBQ style chicken, mashed potatoes & gravy, macaroni & cheese, corn, chard, salad, cottage cheese, chicken fried steak, biscuits & all the other things that KFC serves.  (See more in my original review.)  This buffet gives you all this plus help yourself beverages for only $7.99/$6.99 Sr.  They did sometimes let something run out for a few minutes, but with that said, it was quite a lunch by the time we were finished, & I'd say this Buffet is not to be missed if you love good chicken!     :-))
4 Wow, it's been a long time since I've been to KFC, but I was craving some original recipe fried chicken. I ordered a three piece meal, but I noticed that they have a buffet for 7.99, which was more value for your money and a three piece meal and comes with all the different chickens, sides, drink and dessert! Great to know there is a KFC nearby to count on when I have a craving!
