5 In need of blue corn tortillas for a enchilada dish I am planning on making for our extended family at an important celebration this weekend, I went to all of my favorite Mexican supermarkets only to be disappointed. On-line, however, I discovered positive reviews of Mama Lola's Tortillas. While they mostly provide fresh tortilla products for the best restaurants in the Phoenix-metro area, they also sell about 20% of their products as stores such at Sprouts. When I went over to their office, which is located conveniently off of the highway, I discovered an amateur cook's treasure. All varieties of tortillas (corn and flour), freshly made of high quality ingredients, plus supplies for tamales, tortillas chips of a variety of colors, and even an assortment of pan dulce. While I was there I was invited by the very friendly Plant Manager, Jasmin Garcia, into her office to see some of her new product offerings. They have an impressive line of offerings, including tostada shells of various colors. I left with a handful of tasty blue corn tortillas, healthy but very tasty whole wheat tortillas, and a batch of awesome tasting red child whole wheat flour burrito-sized tortillas that my coworkers devoured when we tried them at lunch in the office. Given that their products are affordable, made without preservatives, and high quality ingredients, I can't see buying my tortillas anywhere else. What a great experience.
5 Rito's uses these tortilla's and they have the best burritos in town!
