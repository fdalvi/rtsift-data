5 Yes, they are open.  And yes, they know how to cut hair properly and not irritate you with a bad haircut.    I am fond that they actually listen to you and seem to care about what you are saying.  I have dealt with too many that just blow me off and do what THEY want to do... and these guys aren't like that.  I have also heard they carry ammonia free hair dye... so pregnant women... you can get your hair dyed here. :)
5 No... I am not the manager/owner. lol Just a happy customer with my great cheap haircut.
5 Loved my haircut. Walked in and waited for just a minute. The stylist cut exactly like I wanted and I walked out paying 20 which included the tip.
5 Fast, good price, Jessica Rocks!  She is great to chat with and is very talented!
