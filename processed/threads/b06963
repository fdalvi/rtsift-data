4 This place might get my vote for Madison's best pizza.  Their deep dish is definitely the way to go.  The mix of cheese that they use for their pizzas is superior to the cheese used by all other pizza places in the area.  All day special of $4 for two slices and a soda is awesome, although they don't always have fresh slices since most people order whole pies.  Decent cold subs and awesome hot subs.  Being open until 3am or later every night is also a huge plus.
5 I found the best pizza in Madison, friends. It took 8 years of Madison-dwelling but after careful consideration this is it. It doesn't get any better in this city. They boast an amazing cheese and sauce combination that other Madison pizza places cannot manage to do. ALSO the calzones are amazing. I get mine with spinach and feta.
3 I tried the deep dish pizza.  I've never really eaten deep dish pizza so I can't say whether it was good or bad.  As far as pizza, it was fine and I didn't have any complaints.  Crust was good, cheese was good.  Not outstanding or anything, but good.    BUT  Way too expensive.  The thing was tiny, basically enough to feed 2.   And it came to like 14 bucks.
3 Really good, greasy pizza.  However, in a town full of truly great pizza (Glass Nickel, Ian's, and Roman Candle), Falbo Bros is just a late night stop.  It is what it is.
2 Had a stuffed pizza and wasn't impressed in the least. Firstly, they forgot my toppings and just gave it to me plain - I let it slide, since they forgot to bill me for it as well. More importantly, every ingredient in the pizza sucked.   The crust tasted exactly like some half-assed bread I made earlier that day out of nothing but water and some generic yeast and flour. The tomato sauce was clearly tomato paste that came straight out of the can, perhaps mixed with some garlic powder or dried oregano to give it just a bit more flavor. Finally, the cheese just wasn't up to Wisconsin standards. It tasted rubbery and greasy, like prepackaged string cheese.  For what I'm paying, I might as well be getting pizza from a good, reliable place like Glass Nickel. $15 for a medium? I could get something of the exact same quality from Domino's for a third of that price.
5 The best....period!   Thin crust, mushroom and cheese, extra well done so its almost bunt cut into squares.
4 My new digs are very close to my work so, on occasion, I get to have lunch with my S.U. It's also close to this pizza place and I'd noticed good traffic going in and out. Since West Coast Pizza, for the most part, sucks,  we've been looking forward to getting a pie here in this eastward looking town. We called in a large thin crust with toppings to eat there and arrived minutes before it came out of the oven. Perfect timing.  The pizza I grew to love back east had in-house tomato sauce and fresh ground cheese blends. Here, the sauce was right. The Mozzarella, Romano and Parmigiana cheese blend was nice. The crust was a bit thin for my tastes. I like the tip to hang just a little. You know, where you have to support the tip with a finger? Good though. The right level of chewy-ness.  They don't put a lot of effort into the in-store dining. Two booths, no silverware, hot peppers or cheese on the table, that's it. Serving beer would be awesome but ...Don't care. The pizza was good.  They've got a fan.
3 after a few beers at the mason lounge, we stopped into falbo bros. and ordered a pizza for carry out. there were only three of us in the store but for some reason it took forever to get our order. their pizza is decent, but they need to speed it up.
1 There are few things that can go wrong when you give a drunk man a pizza and a side of breadsticks.  Whatever shortfalls a pizza may have are typically ignored in the drunken feeding frenzy or drowned out by copious lathering in ranch sauce. Falbo Brothers has performed an amazing feat by producing a pizza so vile and foul that not only could I not finish a single slice, but I was nearly brought to vomiting by the mere sight of my brother taking bites of this sewage-inspired cheese pie.  TL;DR: Worst.  Pizza.  Ever.  Inedible.
5 Nothing fancy, but great pizza!  This was my husband's and my favorite pizza place throughout college and med school.  There are no frills, just honest to goodness down to earth pizza.  We have always loved their thin crust pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni.  The crust is thin and crusty, and the tomato sauce very good (and my husband is VERY particular about tomato sauce).   Their stuffed crust pizza is even better!  We probably haven't had it for about five year since we now live outside of Madison, but I picked up a pie on my way home last week, and it was JUST as good as we remembered it :)
4 I love their thin crust.. Their version of a stuffed pizza is pretty nice.. And while I understand its hard to mess up chicken strips, they seem to come out perfect every time.. Occasionally I will get a pie that's a little over cooked for my liking otherwise they would get the 5 star!  Try a thin crust meatball pizza with black olives.. Thank me later :)
4 Here is the deal with Falbo's  Don''t expect any, and I mean any, customer service. Expect to call and have the person on the other end of the phone be rude and inattentive. Also, always have exact change if you get it delivered, Falbo's drivers are known to not carry change.   That being said, their pizza and salads are boss. This is a working mans pizza (food not price) and damn it is good. The salads are also amazing and generously portioned.   If you can put up with the attitude, falbo's is worth every penny.
1 We have enjoyed this pizza for years, but had our final visit this evening.  We were told our carry out order would take 25-30 minutes and instead it took an hour.  My husband went to pick up our order and was told it was with the delivery guy.  They tracked him down and he brought our order back, minus the salad which my husband wasn't aware of.  When I called to complain, the "manager" said, "Oh yeah, it's sitting here if you want to get it."  I replied, "This is bulls**t," and the manager berated me for swearing at him, told me I was being blackballed and hung up on me.  Seriously?  When I called back to request a refund for the salad, I was told they don't do refunds.  When I asked to speak to one of the owners, I was told to call back tomorrow, the manager wasn't leaving a note.  This is not our first botched order.  The last time we ordered from these geniuses, they "couldn't find it" and sent my husband next door for a cigar on them... That's classy!  They frequently forget toppings, but make certain to charge for them.  Time for the owners to do a little spring cleaning at their Parmenter location.  Me?  I'm going to frequent business that appreciate my business and take pride in their job and their product.  I would love to see their blackball list... this place can't get orders right, but can maintain a list of who they refuse to sell to.  Priceless!
2 Stay away from the Chicago-style deep-dish/stuffed whatever, it is a rip-off joke preying on the desperation of those who have had Chicago pizza for real from Lou Malnati's or Gino's East.  The thin crust works as a lower end quick pizza fix, once again there is much better to be had, especially outside of Madison. Pizza Brutta is a much better choice for those stuck in Madison.  Go to Chicago for a pizza vacation and see what real pizza is, then you will know what you've been missing, and at least could then judge if pizza is truly good or not.
1 Great pizza. Worst service ever! The employees do NOT want to be working there. When you call (which I do regularly as I live so close), it is like they don't want to be a business and make money. If you have a chance to go elsewhere, I would, and just because of the service.
5 Full Disclaimer:  I have been eating Falbo's since they first opened when I was in College.  My Senior year, I actually lived right above it when it was located on the ground floor of La Ciel.  Coming in after bartime to see what pizzas were ordered but never picked up was a pasttime. (cheap eats).  Maybe it was the constant wafting of pizza goodness coming through my windows but I have been a fan since Day 1.  Fast forward almost twenty years (yikes!) and the pizza still delivers.  While I am a fan of their thin crust, I feel their stuffed pizza is sublime.  My order is simple:  Stuffed pizza with banana peppers and pepperoni.  Take home and douse with Tapatio or Valencia hot sauce.  Consume enough to feed a small army.  Repeat every few months. Yes, the service can be gruff.  The location on Park St. is almost non-descript.  But these are small prices to pay for great pizza.
5 I have also been eating Falbo Bros pizza since college. I considered it the best pizza in Madison then and it is still the best pizza in Madison now. Great sausage. Lots of cheese. Good sauce. Great crust. This is some of the best pizza I've ever had and I've had it well over one hundred times. Go eat this pizza now.
1 No stars... I ordered a pizza from Falbo Bros (N. Sherman Avenue) in Madison last July. The usual-- thick, dense, not good gluten free crust . Very dense. I ordered another one on October 7th. Same deal. I ordered another pizza from them on October 20th and was shocked by the crust-- light, thin, not dense, and it was AMAZING. But, it was too good to be true-- my boyfriend (non celiac) tasted it and said it tasted just like his regular crust.  I emailed the company that night and asked them if they had changed their crust recently. I told them if they had not changed it, that their kitchen had made a very serious mistake and needed to be much more careful in the future. They emailed me back on October 22nd saying they'd changed it and asked if I liked it. Of course I did-- it was amazing.  So... I ordered another one on October 23. (PS: I am recovering from major surgery so I have been ordering in more than usual.) October 23 was again, a wonderful crust-- and my boyfriend said it tasted just like his. My skin was itchy and I spent a lot of time trying to figure out where the gluten poison had come from but figured they had no reason to lie in the email and certainly, they would not have made the same mistake twice.  We had a coupon so last week, I ordered TWO gluten free pizzas. Amazing, wonderful pizzas. And I ate them both. And, my skin was itchy, my skin developed deep infections, and I really started to wonder where on earth I was getting into such horrible gluten ingestion. And as with any celiac, I got tired because I was unable to absorb my nutrition properly.  I really didn't believe the pizza thing... so I set out to order some gluten free home test kits. In the mean time, we ordered pizza Monday night for the Packer game... and what should they deliver but their old, usual, dense crust gluten free crust that tasted horrible.  I wrote them a scathing email-- that they lied about a recent crust change (they had the same crust in July), that they did not ask their kitchen to be more careful, that they charged me extra for gluten free, and that their careless and negligent attitude could seriously sicken someone with severe celiac (though, no celiac would order a gluten free pizza from a gluten kitchen, I am sure.)  No email back after I called them out on it.  Email copies available upon request.  Will do no future business with them after their careless attitude about gluten allergy.
1 I keep giving this place a try, as I did today because no where else was open Christmas Day, but it's just not that good. I have a very particular pizza order - thin crust, lots of extra sauce, very light cheese, square cut. Nothing difficult, but not standard. The only pizzas I've ever gotten from Falbo Bros are an inedible level of greasy for me. Apparently they don't care much for special orders or requests, because I have never had them honored. Too bad, because the crust is interesting, but it's made so soggy by the cheese grease that it ruins most of it. If you're looking for grease, this is your place. Me, I think I will stick to Glass Nickel where they make my pizza to specification every single time.
1 I've been ordering two or three times a week for about a year. They have really been going downhill.  The food has been arriving cold and they screw something up on every order. I called them and they are so very rude, even to a regular customer.  I'm done. There are too many places in Madison to put up with it. I guess they haven't grown with their business. I don't know what the problem is; but I'm moving on...  Ed
4 The only reason I'm giving Falbo's 4 stars and not 5 is because, (like many others mention) the costumer service really lacks. We're new to the area and this is by FAR the best pizza we've had in Madison. But just know, when you call to place your order, it's like talking to a burnt-out who can't comprehend what you're saying. Talk slowly and repeat. I don't even think they asked for a name on the order. Haha, all in good fun, who ever makes the pizzas is freakin' amazing. I've had both the Hawaiian Chicken and The Mason and they both were soooo good. Amazing flavor, good crust. Can't beat it. We ordered the Italian Stallion tonight.. Can't wait to eat it!
1 Extremely slow delivery and the food is mediocre.
