3 it is a pool supply store. not much else to say overpriced supplies but if you want good products you are going to have to pay for them. Staff is knowledgeable and helpful.
1 I bought a safety fence and gate a month ago, still have no fence. I ordered it, waited, and was so dissatisfied. I am so glad I inspected the gate. Had I not, I would have had to pay a restocking fee. Upon opening the box, or should I say after I saw the box opened by the manager before I got there, I found the mesh was ripped. If I wanted a new one after I left the store I would have had to pay. I then handed it back and said please get me one that is not ripped, how long do I have to wait? I ordered this deal a month ago and still have nothing. I ordered the fence because I have a need, not just because. The manager Katherine has lost her attitude at this point, but it is too late. I called corporate to complain and get something going, but all they did was call the store and have Katherine call me, who did and asked why we called corporate. I cannot imagine how a company so poorly run could be so big. I know, ripping people off. They are the only ones who carry this fence so I am stuck. GO TO NPS PEOPLE!!!!!!!!
5 We recently moved into a pool home and I visited Leslie's to get a referral for a pool service.  Catherine suggested I do the job myself and provided training and advise for several weeks.  The pool looks great and many thanks to Catherine and the able staff at Leslie's!
