4 Located in a shopping center near the Deja Vu emporium. This store has all the typical dancer and cocktail waitress outfits as well as overpriced rhinestone jewelry and a decent selection of shoes/boots. The real find here is the outfit making shop located within that can custom make outfits from a variety of fabrics. They were able to ruche the butt of an ill-fitting Victoria Secret swimsuit bottom for me for only $6. Now my butt looks fantastic in this suit! Thank you. And they have pink robes in the dressing rooms if you are modest.
5 It was my 31st birthday and I decided that as a birthday gift to myself I would get the scrunch butt bikini I have always wanted and worked so hard for in the gym. I had heard about this place from a few friends from work and boy were they right on target.   First off this is NOT a place for children...keep them at home (I don't think they are even allowed in the store). You walk in and its trashy lingerie central...which I don't mind at all. The bikinis are in the back and they have every color imaginable....plus if you can't find it they will custom make it for you. Antonia (I think that's her name) did a beautiful job on turning the royal blue bikini I chose from a tie string side to a connected double string side (tie string is too easy to come undone...nobody needs to see the goods). All of this cost me less than $50!!!! How cool is that?!? The only thing I will do next summer is pay more to get it lined...its kind of easy to tell if you are cold or not if you catch my drift.   Overall an easy and fun shopping experience. Its a great place for all the girls out there who want to get something spicy for their man. I will definitely be back. See you next summer Judith!
5 Nice boutique type store with reasonable prices compared to other boutiques that caters to dancers. If you are looking for something that you dont want 10 other girls wearing on the floor, thats the store :)
