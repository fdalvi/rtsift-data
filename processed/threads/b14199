5 Well I was initially not thrilled that they wanted to take from my checking account but glad I looked into other options.  They have a package where you can prepay for the year, so I signed up.  Very good gym, and nice machines.  I like the anytime element of the deal also, and like being able to go there when I want.  I'm sold.  Good stuff here folks.  Also, it is a nationwide chain with a fair share of locations.
4 My husband added me on to his membership for my birthday and so far, I like it. It's a gym without the meatmarket feel. I like that I can go anytime I want. The equipment is great. Lots of variety, always in good, clean, WORKING condition. There is no babysitting available so you definitely have to plan ahead to use the facility. Also, absolutely no one under 16 is allowed on the gym floor at all so don't plan on having your tweens or younger teens coming along with you to use the equipment. They claim to offer classes though I've not had the chance to experience them because the times don't work with my schedule at all and I'm not sure what the variety is on the classes as no one else seems to know when I ask, but so far, I'd say that this is worthy of 3.5 to 4 stars. :)
4 Been coming here for about three years now.  The price is decent given that you can come to the gym anytime you please (24/7/365). Coming from a larger gym; there is less free weights, which means that you will have to change your routines accordingly. However; aside from the lack of free weights, the availability of this place makes it worth while. The new owners seem nice (haven't really spoken with them given my schedule) and the gym has received a bit of a makeover within the past year. Good place to workout!
