1 Its a McDonalds...
4 K, I had to search for this specific McDonalds.   Like I said before, it is what it is. I rate things for what they are beyond what they are... does that make any sense??  Anyways, the people here are super friendly. There is a weird trend with fast food in this area- the workers are all oddly friendly. This place is the same way. I really can't justify a 5 star rating for a McDonalds, but I will give it 4 stars considering it's a great place to drive through for a dollar drink from time to time.
1 Every time I go to this McDonald's I fill like I am bothering them.  I am a simple man. I order the same thing every time, off the menu And they get it wrong every time.   The guy that's on the register is straight up stupid.
5 I never expect much from  drive thru - its McDonalds right.   Well the cashier was perky, friendly and professional - okay? The second window was just as friendly and professional and attentive. WOW - I was super stunned - nice job who manages that store
3 Staff are friendly, but their internet is sloooooow. I've been here 20 minutes and my iPad is only half done in downloading today's newspaper (not the big Sunday paper, it's Thursday). Follow up: download of the paper took 32 minutes, but now I gotta leave.
1 Slowest service ever, sitting in drive through for ten minutes now :(   Not very good, drink was watery...
4 Stopped for breakfast yesterday morning and they were supper fast and everything was fresh and just as I order. Did I mention that the staff is supper friendly? I live close to the McDonalds on Bethany Home, they are terrible. I'll drive out of the way for always fresh French fries from now on.
