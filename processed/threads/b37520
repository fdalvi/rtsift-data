5 Julie definitely came to the rescue the night before my cousin's wedding! She was very reasonable and extremely efficient.
5 Julie is awesome! I am very happy I found her in time to alter my wedding dress. My dress is very intricate and I was scared to have it altered, but Julie definitely knows what she is doing and is very accommodating. She is also altering two of my bridesmaids' dresses, and did a stellar job on a complicated fix. Thank you for all of your work Julie!
