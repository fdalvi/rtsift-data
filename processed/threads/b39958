5 When I got home one day after work, I found out my fridge full of food was not working. I immediately started looking around for an appliance repair company, hoping I can still get a hold of someone before 6pm. Thank GOD I found Del Tech. They came over within an hour and quickly fixed my fridge. The tech was nice and professional.  He also taught me some maintenance tips that I can perform at home.
5 Sometimes it's hard to choose a repair company because people who aren't knowledgeable about mechanics are afraid of choosing the wrong company. You don't have to worry about any of that with this company.   The technician who came to our house to fix our refrigerator was friendly, quick, came the same day we called, knowledgeable, and above all HONEST.   He explained everything in easy to understand terms with no bull at all. The price was reasonable and the warranty on the work can't be beat. They called back the next day to check on how the fridge was working and if everything was ok. Also, they are all veterans. You can't really go wrong with this company.
5 Our refrigerator seals were burning hot and after looking online we saw that it was likely the fan. D called and asked a lot of questions I took for granted. What he was doing was diagnosing the problem as best he could so he had the best preparation of parts. D went the extra step when he saw that the replacement fan was not very good quality, he went and got another one.  We were completely satisfied wit D and Del Tech Services. D was referred by a friend so we thought he would be good. He was very thorough. He arrived when he said he would and worked very cleanly.  D gave some excellent advice when restarting our fridge if we move or disconnect it. He  was very respectful and professional.  Thanks a lot. We would strongly recommend Del Tech Services. Thanks for your service to our country too.
