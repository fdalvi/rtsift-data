5 What nice guys. Awesome service. They break down the cost and are far better than any locksmith I have ever used. They have a new customer for life !!! I had my car stole from my husbands car so we had to get my whole car rekeyed.  They were quick and did an amazing job.
5 I needed an extra set of keys for my RV, and a neighbor recommended Gene's. Now, some keys for RV's are pretty weird for the outside compartments and the entrance door. I was expecting they probably wouldn't be able to match all four. Not only did they match all four, but they all worked perfectly the first time. Their customer service is excellent, and while your keys are being made, they have a lot of cool stuff to look at in their store. If you can get out of there with just your keys, and not finding something else you "need," don't start looking around.
