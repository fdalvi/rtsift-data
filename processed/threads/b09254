4 I can't believe I am the first person to review this.   Okay, this is off an experience 6 1/2 years ago. A friend of mine from here in Boston was visiting me while I was out in Vegas still. We went th Phoenix to see a game at then-Bank One Ballpark, and we asked a bartender at a spot near the hotel where to go to drink our faces off. This was recommended.  Well, we get there and this place looks like a freakin' barn, literally. We got in in time for the penny draft rush. Two of the bartenders were from Boston, and immediately we felt at home. Now, this is the typical college bar crowd, so be warned. I probably wouldn't go now, but I had a blast when I did.  The best was going to the restroom, seeing what I could only describe as a long pig trough for a urinal, and overhearing a guy coach his buddy onto the right way to take a piss in these things because there was a "splash factor" involved. I nearly peed on myself from laughing. I didn't, though. Years of practice helped.
5 What a joint it was...I was the first to get drunk there in 1971...Guarantee...I got there at 11am and hammered drinks and went home.  Went back all the time...Beers were 31cents and mixed drinks 69 cents. They only sold Budweiser and 1 type of booze...Bacardi, Jack etc....  Classic place in its day.
4 It was a great place back in the day!  Not sure I recall the food, but it was always a fun gathering for a party.  One of our school mates was friends with the owner so drinks were cheap.  RIP Minder Binders.
5 What a great piece of AZ History!  Now if I could only find out if someone will sell the Creature from the Black Lagoon that was inside!
5 Being worked on?
