1 DO NOT GO HERE!  Watch out - they will ruin your clothes and then give you the biggest, most expert run around you can ever imagine if you try to get them to replace them.  The owner is a blatant lier and she will rip you off.
4 I've been coming here forever.  Good quality work for a very reasonable price.  In probably 15 years, they have lost maybe one shirt.  I get at least 40 shirts cleaned there per month.
4 The ladies who run this cleaners are so friendly, I trust them with our dry cleaning and alterations.  They always do a great job cleaning and alterations usually come out well too... and for a great price!  Only thing is if something you're having cleaned or altered has more than one thing that's needs attention, you need to be very specific and point it out more than once.  Most of the time though, they are great!    See ya there!
5 Once again DC pulls off a great seamstress job on 2 pairs of pants! (At a great price)  I've been going here for my seamstress and dry cleaning needs since 2002.  The friendly staff may sometimes be hard to understand, but they sincerely care about their customers and produce high quality results.  Remember to have cash or check-- they DO NOT take credit/debit.  (If you forget to bring cash you can walk over to the nearby McDonald's or gas station and get cash back with a purchase)
4 I have been a customer at this shop since it opened.  This is the second owner and the service and quality are excellent.  We have clothes cleaned, some washed and pressed.  Quilts and duvets washed and pressed.  Lots of alterations (hems, sleeves).  The work is great, quick, and everyone is friendly.
