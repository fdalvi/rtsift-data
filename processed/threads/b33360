2 I will not go back to this place nor do I recommend it. The people are very nice don't get wrong. The service is great. The problems: 1. The prices are too high. I get suckered into choosing a more expensive pedicure package bc I think I'm saving some money but I'm not. It would come out to the Same price if I did it all a la carte.  2. I just got them done last week and pedicure is already ruined. It actually never looked good. It is too expensive for what I got. I can go to other places and get them done and they usually last for months. So this place must be doing something wrong.  3. Can I just say they are over priced again. If you go here you will be paying more than others and getting nothing more in return.   I got my nails done. They did a good job on that. But not any better than other places.   Needless to say. I would not recommend this place to anyone. (unless I didnt like you!)  ;) nykki  Oh yeah. what's up with places asking for the tip in cash. If I had cash then I wouldnt be using my credit card in the first place. I am not going to go to the bank just to tip you in cash!!
3 This nail salon is ok, but don't go here expecting a real 'spa' experience. I went here today with a couple of friends to get pedicures as the salon is close to where we live and convenient for all of us. We made appointments and did not have to wait, so that was a positive. One of my friends' man who did her toes was really friendly and personable, but my guy was not. Mine was a younger man, and he did a nice job, but he gave a pretty weak massage and was texting and watching tv throughout the pedi. Not really the best experience, but my toes came out nice and my little toe design turned out cooler than my friends (sorry guys!) so he gets props for that. I felt like for a newer salon, the massage chairs weren't the best and a lot of the 'fun' nail colors offered were in off brands (not OPI or China Glaze)...which makes me wary to try them. A basic pedi was 22$ and the nail design was 5$, so it is fairly reasonable, but I don't know if I would go back because I had a better experience at a different salon (nails 8000) for around the same price.
5 The best Nail salon in the valley!!! Nor only are the technicians amazing & friendly but if they make a mistake they go out of there way to make it right! Price is also very fair! Lindsey and Tom are the owners and are awesome people!!! Kudos to the shop! Will never go anywhere else!
3 It wasn't horrible. The girl seemed like she couldn't be bothered and wanted to be else were. The guy was trying to be impressive with all his different topics. He was be over bearing and ignoying  to me. I wasn't  impressed by his conversations.  They job they did was standard.
3 I come here if I want a pedicure every couple months because it's close to my house. Depending on the day and time, it can get really busy so I would suggest going later in the day on weekdays (they close at 7pm). The staff working there are friendly and accomodating. It's definitely not top of the line but it's nice enough. For a basic pedicure, it's around $20 but I always get callus removal, which is a $5 charge. I've gotten a gel manicure here before too and was told it would last 2 weeks without chips. Mine lasted 5 days before it started looking bad. I'm not really into manicures anyways. One thing I do like about this place is you can just walk in and not have to make an appointment. I wish the pedicures lasted a little longer and that they used hot rocks like competing nail salons but it's still a nice time to relax.
5 I love love love this place!!! I have been coming here since they opened. Yes, they may be more expensive than other places, but I have tried those "other" places and I have been  disappointed by them!! If I ever have a problem with something it's always fixed quickly! My mom and sisters all come here and they love it just as much. I will never go to another place again!   I also love that they get to know you by name & always make you feel welcomed. Or when you've been away for awhile they are excited to see you again.  I am truly happy with this nail shop and I will continue to come here!
4 Writing this review because I think this place deserves better ratings. The service is exceptionally friendly, and my pedicures have always been excellent. The one time that I had to rush out the door before my pedicure had fully dried, the owner told me to come back and he'd fix it for free if it smudged. Prices are a little higher than some other places nearby, but I'm happy to pay it for consistent quality and a clean, welcoming salon.
1 Pretty awful. I only went here one time, and I got a full set of acrylic. I had a picture of what I wanted him to paint on one nail of each hand, and he did an absolutely awful job. I don't even know if he realized that his drawing looked nothing at all like the picture he had right in front of him the whole time he was painting. I could have forgiven that (although it was hilariously bad) but even up to 2 hours after I got my nails done they were still denting at everything I touched. Also, the tips of my nails were all crooked.  I had to get my nails completely redone.
4 Recently I needed to get my nails fixed before going to a wedding for the week. I was unsure where to go and wanted to go on my way home which was around 5pm. They got me in quickly and there were multiple polish colors for me to choose from!!   The only reason they are not receiving 5 stars is because even though they were very welcoming and quick the lady constantly talked in her other language with a co worker and continuously kept laughing. This made not only me a little uncomfortable but also  the lady next to me who even gave a look as if she couldn't believe what was happening.
2 I like to give every place a second chance, but this place received one by default.  I went here recently, having just come from out of town on the way to a job interview.  I am trying to grow my nails out/strengthen the nail beds,  so planned to forego gel polish, but since no one asked, offered, or recommended anything in the way of gel polish, specials, combos, etc., when directed, I chose a regular polish. (None of the three technicians were occupied when I entered.) The tech did show me the card to choose my pedicure. The chair was very relaxing; no real complaints about the pedicure, though I was a little embarrassed by the cleavage of the young lady (and I'm not a prude); pretty decent callous removal, even though I only chose  the "regular" pedicure; leg massage was very nice. When it was time for the manicure (same tech) I was asked about filing a little and evening out, and what shape, to which I said yes, just file a little and square-rounded. Next thing I knew she had clipped my longest nail with a pair of big clippers, then proceeded to clip them all (no need stopping her at that point because it would have looked weird); however, the one nail I had expected to be clipped and filed wasn't even touched. I thought it had been fixed during the cuticle work, but even hang nails were missed, as discovered later.  The polish went on and even then seemed a bit thick, but, hey - I'm not the technician. After she started the polish, she asked why I didn't like gel; I told her no one mentioned it, but I didn't want my nail beds filed on, like I have had done before, to which she replied they don't do that there; even though I expressed interest, she made no suggestion to do it or start over.    I was moved over to the UV drying station and just left there for 10 min. or so. Needing to get to my interview, I looked at the manager, standing behind the counter, and asked if he thought they were ready; he said oh, sure...didn't even check, but I got the feeling he was waiting for me, so I gathered my things carefully and went to pay. When I asked the name of my technician, he didn't even know, but did find out. I noticed one of my nails smudge so asked if I could/should dry some more. I waited another ten min. and left. Within a few minutes, even though super careful, three nails looked like they had just melted...the whole shebang had slid down toward my cuticle! Not having any time, I smoothed them and poured water on them ASAP (a quick set trick from an old manicurist), and hid my fingers during the interview. (Note: toes were just fine, even after slamming into shoes for interview; four hours afterward, my fingernails were still mushy and pitting!)   I planned to chalk it up to "lesson learned", but found myself in the area the next afternoon and decided to see if they would fix my manicure. While much busier, the lady manager (I think, no one introduced themselves ever!) came right over and loudly proclaimed they would fix for free, though she denied anything being wrong with the polish, that it was probably my fault for rushing...but why hadn't I done gel nails? I explained. She called up another technician (the guy manager did remember my technician's name from day before), still loudly declaring they would fix but I must stay longer. When I mentioned my toes were fine, that I thought they may want to take that bottle of polish down, they said toenails dry differently than fingernails and the polish works differently. REALLY? Which turnip truck do you think I fell off of? I decided to ask if they would discount a gel manicure, and they knocked $10 off, handed me over to the new manicurist, amid much foreign chatter and what appeared to be an attempt to hide me from the previous manicurist. (I see someone else mentioned the huge amount of giggling, seeming side exchanges, and foreign conversation, which I do find to be a little disrespectful.) My new caretaker was polite, made suggestions/created my color, but did ask why I liked my nails so short; though I think that was a little impertinent (but not as much as her cleavage; no I am NOT a weirdo, but worse than the day before!), I responded I didn't, that her colleague had snipped them off! This gal did some prep, continuing to extol the wonders of gel polish, had me wash up without soap, and finished the manicure. I ended up being moved near my manicurist from the previous day, explained what happened, suggested she may want to take the polish down, to which the present manicurist rolled her eyes and clicked her tongue. While she did a decent job, the polish ran over my cuticles to some degree (and now 4 days later, polish is beginning to flake off at edges). I paid; I left...and won't go back.  I'm sure this place is good for some, but not for me.    Note: The shop is quiet enough, no fumes, fairly clean - though never did see sterilized equipment, and the restroom/hall area were kind of dingy.
5 I decided to make this place my regular spot for nails after trying several other local places. I like this place the best because: - it's a lot cleaner than other area salons - the people are always friendly and seem to recognize their customers - they keep expanding their options, including new colors - there is enough going on that I can stay entertained while sitting through the hour-long process of getting a gel manicure - the prices are competitive with other local salons  I've never had a bad service and I highly recommend this salon.
5 I got my pedicure done today, and I love it. The young girl did my toes perfectly. She gave me a nice massage on my legs. I recommend you guys to come here and try it.
3 Decent place, wasn't thrilled with the manicure. It was very busy that day, but it felt very rushed and little attention to detail that left my nails uneven and cuticles a mess. Not sure if I will be back.
2 This place is really a hit or miss.  The service/quality is never the same. Some times they do a fantastic job other times I could have done a better job and saved myself the money. Making an appointment means nothinf to them so don't waste your time making one. The one good thing is the quality of the eye brow waxing,  they always do my eye brows great.
1 Ouch! I had a painful manicure experience! She was so rough, I left bleeding! She also just wiped off the tools she used on me and stuck them back in the case. Yikes. She seemed to be in such a hurry, yet there was only two other customers in there (and probably six employees). I was not impressed and would never return.
5 My first time today at Beverly Nails and I gotta say my experience was amazing!!! I went in not expecting much because of the reviews but because this place is so close to my house I thought I would give it a try! My nails look fierce for prom and I'm so happy with the results! Man who did my nails was friendly and welcoming! I highly recommend this place if you are looking for affordable yet stunning nails. (Full set only $25)
