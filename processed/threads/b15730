5 A great church full of genuinely caring people.  The church staff are wonderful and I am proud to say I call many of them friends.  The church also has been actively involved in the foster care ministry I lead.  Their support has been vital over the years.  Specifically they have collected Christmas gifts for us 5 years running.  I highly recommend checking them out if you live in the area.
