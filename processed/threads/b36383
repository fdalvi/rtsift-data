1 Plain and simple; poorly managed, unorganized, unprofessional and prices are high for what your child will gain. There is a lot of preferential treatment given to some dancers by the owner. If you are going to invest money in a dance studio for your child, DO NOT COME HERE, do your research and invest in a studio that has high ratings and has been around for a long time where your child will actually learn and have the opportunity to compete with competitive studios.
1 Lot of cancelled classed and when they aren't cancelled there always seems to be a young teenager running the classes. High prices for what you are getting. The owners are a mother daughter duo and are always arguing. The mom is always at the front desk and is nasty to everyone who walks in the door except those she thinks she can get money from. She is always saying negative things about parents and students alike. Hip hop class has gone through multiple teachers this year. Can't wait for their overpriced recital to be over so I can take my children to a studio that actually provides good dance training.

5 Outstanding dance studio with ownership that has tons of passion and heart.  In fact, this is the only studio that competes in most all of the competitions in the Las Vegas area and does not over charge the parents with exuberant added costs that most of the other studios do....quality instruction and mentorship throughout your child's early dance career, from a family-run studio that treats "you" as family...haven't found that anywhere in the highly competitive Las Vegas dance studio market.  This studio puts on an amazing production at the end of the year that partners with dance studios and choreographers from the UK.  They have a very impressive vocal department and piano instruction as well...don't make a final decision on where you would like your child to take instruction until you attend Step Up Academy....see for yourself. :o).
