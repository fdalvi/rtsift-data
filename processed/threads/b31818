3 It's a bus station. It's fairly central in town (in fact, very central). There are lots of services that run all over the country. It's also quite a new building.  It just irks me that they charge 30p to use the toilet! You get off a 6 hour bus journey, where the toilet was...questoinable. You're creaky and needing to stretch your legs and get your whole body feeling human again, and you have to look around in your purse for a 20p and 10p piece. Let's just say I wasn't the happiest of bunnies.  The staff member on duty was nice and kind about it, and it seems to echo what they do in train stations. But I've got to be honest; a totally a-ok train station apart from that.
