2 I admit I am not a fan of fried foods, nor am I a fan of seafood, so the idea that I actually eat here every so often isn't smart on my part. However, the chicken is SO delicious! I mean, really really juicy and tasty. However, that is the ONLY good thing about this place. I am sure this place is painfully typical for a Long John Silver's, however, this is the only one I've ever been to and I've only come in twice a year- tops.   The whole place smell awful, it's clearly the smell of their vast vats of oil to fry everything they offer. Limited menu, and nothing healthy, even if they claim it is, don't play into their lies.  Over all, clean, nice service, but the food is sub-par.
4 I came here last Friday (04/06/2012, Good Friday) for lunch. Most of these locations look the same, not that great looking. Anyways, I dont come here for the location but the food.   I rate the food at 4 stars, I've never had bad food here. It's always served hot and juicy. It's affordable and good.  The service I had, would give them a 5 star rating. It could have been this location and a good day. My cashier was Nathan and he was respectful and polite. The guy that brought me my food was Aric and he too was respectful and polite. I cant remember the last time I had seen something like this with young kids. But, I was impressed.
1 I have not good time stomach after eating here. In America it seems Japanese Radiation fish is common in fast food! I do not like fish is same color of mountain dews.
4 Love the chicken at this place. Something I can't eat all the time, but it is a treat when I do.
