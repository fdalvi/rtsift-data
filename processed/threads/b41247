1 I WAS a fan of  this place but they have lost all my business! I always put up with their POOR and SLOW not to mention VERY unprofessional service  because  I thought their food was worth it. Now that one of their own employees  told me they don't even buy  organic ingredients! I LOVED this place when they first opened but now This place sucks all the way around and I will never return here again!
5 I am so upset I missed the first review! It was supposed to be me! I had seen this place driving by Scottsdale a few times in recent weeks and though "Oh, place looks cool, gotta stop in sometime" Well, last night my love and I found ourselves in Raw after some light eating at Sushi Brokers 3 doors down. Apparently it was their first day! They have SO many options in the form of foods, juices, and smoothies and if none of those work for you, you go and create your own. I had an acai bowl - pureed acai mixed with coconut yogurt, topped with granola, blueberries, strawberries, and banana. Phenomenal. My love had some sort of smoothie made with carrot juice called a Bunny Spice. She loved it. They originally misheard her and made the wrong smoothie so they gave it to us for free! Lucky for me it was the one I wanted to try (Almond Awe - worth a visit all on its own). At the end of the day, even if I hated the product that Raw offered, the staff was the best I have encountered in years. This is only the second review I've ever written, it takes a lot for me to do this. I will be back many, many times and I highly recommend you try Raw and spread the word as well.
4 I have driven past it while working out! I went in there and the environment is very clean and spacey! Te selections and the options they have are very good and healthy. Impressed by how organic/healthy! I did notice the staff was kinda slow, maybe it was because they just opened? But the bunny spice smoothie is very good! Just make sure u like ginger;-)
4 I'm so so sooo happy that this place opened up! It's reasonably priced knowing that EVERYTHING is organic! I got the Tuscan chicken wrap and my bf got the miso bowl. And I got the fountain youth smoothie. All very good.
5 They're doing something right here.  Delicious smoothies.  Had the Berry Breeze today or I think that's what it was called.  Either way it was really tasty, and made me feel exponentially healthier afterwards.  While I was there, I saw one of the workers making a bowl that looked really fresh! Can't wait to grab one for dinner some time. I know its strange to say, but I couldn't help thinking "ital is vital" while I was there.   I shall report back on my next visit, but so far they've set the bar pretty high.  Welcome to the neighborhood!
5 I stopped in after looking for a healthy place to eat and loved it! I've eaten there twice in a row and will probably do so again. You can order a pre-planned meal or build-your-own. All fresh and organic food. It's a little expensive but what do you expect from such a fresh and healthy restaurant. Very pleased!
1 I have been waiting for this place to open . I went On the first day....  I  created my own smoothie. The gal making it didn't know how to make a smoothie and she kept on asking for help.  My $9 smoothie was nasty and watery.  I didn't want them to feel bad so I said it was good.    I'm sticking with whole foods up the road and their green smoothies are 3 bux cheaper.
5 Bunny spice smoothie delicious! Almond milk, carrot juice, ginger, cinnamon, raw honey. Yum. This was my first of a million visits I'm sure.
5 I was visiting family this past weekend and we stopped by Raw to try it out, we left feeling SO happy we did!!! Right when I looked at the menu, I knew I would love the food and smoothies because their ingredients are organic, fresh and anyone with a  healthy-eating lifestyle would really appreciate this place.  I ordered the meso good bowl and St. Raw Berry smoothie.  Both were YUM!  So fresh, so delicious and so HEALTHY!  It's really nice and convenient that they give you an option to build-your-own food, smoothies and juices.   I wish there were more places like this!  We all said we would definitely come back for more RAW!
5 This is one of my new favorite spots. I normally eat at chop shop, and there is literally no comparison. The Tuscan Chicken is BOMB.com. I ended my lunch with the Fountain of Youth Smoothie, with spinach added at the recommendation of the lovely girl that works here, and was really impressed. The owner also came over to check on us. All around awesome experience.
4 I got the Fiesta Bowl with quinoa for lunch and it was delicious! It actually reminded me of a much healthier version of a Chipotle veggie burrito bowl. While the food was great, the portion was way too large and no single person should eat that much of anything in one sitting, especially at lunch. Seriously, there was enough quinoa for a family of four. I will definitely be going back to RAW to try some other stuff, however, I wish they would lose the chalkboards and get some menus that are easier to read. The Build Your Own offering is not advertised in the restaurant and had I known they offered that option, I would have built my own bowl. I give the food 4 stars and the ambiance and decor about 2. Glad there are some healthier spots opening in Scottsdale!
5 The Fiesta Bowl was the bomb ! I turned it into a salad :) it was so fresh with generous amounts of fresh avacado, the lime ranch was perfect I'm a total ranch fan so I was impressed    If you like it spicy them ask for a little squirt of the Chipotle habanero sauce ! It's so dam good!!  but very spicy like a donkey punch!    The staff were really friendly but didn't know the nutritional content of the smoothies.  They couldn't tell me how many carbs were in the smoothies so that was a turn off because they all sound so freaking  D-lish.  I decided to order the blue sunset so my son could enjoy it he's 6 and was like wow mom this is a yummy treat can we come back.  He also had a cheese quesadilla which was really good according to him as he ate the whole thing.  It was oozing of fresh cheese 4 slices total   The portions are generous the staff is cool and the atmosphere is chill we will absolutely be back I just wish I knew how many Carbs are in the smoothies especially the cocoa nut umm almond awe sound good too !
5 I'm so glad this place opened up recently. If you like fresh juice, acai bowls, healthy wraps and big bowls of amazing food, you must visit this place.   I highly recommend the fiesta bowl with quinoa. It is a good sized portion with black beans, corn, onions, tomatoes and a big blob of avocado. Ask for a side of habanero sauce to give it a little kick. My sis and I agreed that it needed a little more spice and the hot sauce did the trick.   Staff is friendly and eager to make suggestions. I hope these guys get lots of business and stick around for a long time!
3 Mixed feelings about this place. Wish I could give it 3 1/2 stars. I've been there a few times, with varied results. The first time I just got a juice, and it was fine. But it's hard to mess up juice. What was not fine was the $8 price--for the smallest size!  Same juice is less than $5 at Nekter.  Went back another time for a salad and it was very good and priced well. Just wish they had more dressing choices. My husband ordered the salmon wrap and said  it was amazing. In fact he's still talking about it. And it only cost one dollar more than the small juice.   This is definitely a good addition to the neighborhood and I'll keep going back, but not for juice. Not crazy about the  smell inside and there are only a few tables outside. I'm hoping they either add tables outside or improve their ventilation system.
3 First of all this is NOT a cafe that only serves raw food. I came with a friend that solely eats raw food and we had to walk out because they serve salmon, chicken and dairy and for those with strict diets (religious or ethical) and the possibility of cross contamination. It would have been great if they just advertise it as "juice and cafe" or if they really just stick to raw food which does have a huge following and almost zero options in the valley.
5 RAW just opened up recently.  If it wasn't for the far distance, I would come here once a week because they make fresh raw juices however you want it for a fair price.  The ingredients are absolutely fresh.  They do not use too much sugary fruits if you specify how you want to make your juice.  The juice gave me a ton of natural energy for my leg workout day.  I came here with a Groupon as this is a new business that just opened up.
3 Fiesta Bowl with quinoa and chicken is really yummy {HUGE portion}, I'm a sauce freak so I of course had to ask for extra ranch. Final impression is that it's plenty yummy but overpriced. Probably won't go back without a Groupon but was fun to try out.
5 I've been to RAW more than 10 times since they've open, and I've loved everything on their menu! The service at times could be faster but with time, and hopefully switching to a production line of service like Chipotle, they will improve. It's hard to find places that offer organic food for a relatively decent price. RAW has everything I'm looking for in a restaurant when I don't have time to spend hours in the kitchen. I highly recommend this place!
5 This was without question, the BEST $7 organic salad I've had to date.  (No protein)  They let me substitute other ingredients when I omitted some.  Unlike other places that just give you less of a salad, this one was awesome and filling. And the price was right for organic too!  This is my second visit.  Awesome salads both times!  First time there though, they did have a major fishy smell, but it seems to be gone now!  Yeah!
2 Would probably give it 2.5 stars, but decided to round down due to being let down by this place.  We were happy to hear of a healthy restaurant opening up, but we won't be going back.  We came during their grand opening and completely understand that it would be busy. However, we waited over 45 minutes in line. Once we got to the front, we knew why we waited. The staff was very disorganized. Everybody seemed to be doing all of the jobs and moving all over the place. They were moving very slow as well. The guy that took our order didn't give us any info on what to order or how to order. The only thing he told us what that they were "out of avocados." We ordered our food (only 3 items total between the two of us). Once we got to the front, they made us repeat everything we ordered (again, no organization). And they forgot our one smoothie we ordered. We had to wait another 10 minutes to get the smoothie, which was supposed to come to our table. Instead, we had to go to the front to ask about it. The food was just okay or very bland. We didn't add meat to our orders, so maybe that is why? But they should be able to offer decent vegetarian options. Heck, we make a better kale salad at home than what their kale caesar was. And their fiesta bowl seemed to be missing something, as it was very bland. The smoothie was good though. Luckily the grand opening was 50% off. We would never return here for full price, as it's definitely a rip-off.  Again, we love the idea of this place. We love fresh, local, organic produce. And we love decent vegetarian options. But so far, this place just doesn't cut it.
3 I love the concept of this place and it has so much potential. Slim pickings for the vegans who like to eat their food. If you are in the mood to drink your food this is a good place because everything is organic! NONGMO!   Came here once on a groupon and got a smoothie which had the consistency of a juice, which was a bummer but still good.   Remember money is our vote!
4 Been meaning to try this place since it's 2 minutes from my house. I think they are a good concept with huge portions making the price worth it. I got the baby Bleu with chicken.  It was fantastic and the girl cut up 1/2 an apple on the spot right there. So fresh and yummy.   Only suggestions for improvement   1. Put an "exit" and "entrance" sign on the ropes. It isn't obvious and everyone who came in got confused.   2. A salad carton that has a firmly secured lid.  To toss a salad in a to go carton requires the ability to pour the dressing on and shaking it up. I tried with the container and the lid popped up in the corners.   Other than that it was great and we will be back
4 Absolutely loved the green orchard juice and the 1oz. shot of wheatgrass.  My pocketbook did not love the 11.98 price tag. I imagine the prices are so high because it's all organic.  Would suggest offering a 12oz option on juices --i don't need 16 oz-- both my belly and my wallet would be happier.  :-)
4 Great concept!  Good service and food.  It's nice to see places like this becoming more popular. My wife and I will be eating her regularly!
4 We returned here this past week, as the owner reached out to us to extend his apologies for their very busy grand opening. They really did have a ton of people there that day!  We got the fiesta bowl again, and it was so much more flavorful. We also got the salmon salad wrap, and that was very good as well. The smoothie was great (as it was last time too).  The service was much quicker and more on the ball, and the staff was friendlier. The place also has a great vibe!  We saw a good number of people coming in as we were there, and we were glad to see it, as we love seeing people making healthy choices when they eat. Organic is also a plus!  It is so nice to meet an owner who really cares about his business and wants to improve upon each aspect of it. We would definitely give this place an A++ for customer service!
2 Not since Casey at the Bat struck out has been there so little joy in Mudville with a particular outfit. I say that because this restaurant's inauthentic name seems to speak volumes: RAW Organic Food+Juices. Well, first off, the food I've had here is NOT organic food. It's not. Now I'm not religious with organic food, but I've had enough of it over the years to know the difference between Nature's greatest glory and its pesticide-laden counterpart.   Secondly, the rain came and washed away all my dreams because there is a complete and total lack of "RAW" food cuisine, despite the all-caps portion of the venue name. Meaning, there is no "raw food" per se. Oh, I'll grant you that there are some RAW ingredients in some menu items, here and there. Yes, even McDonald's and Burger King can make that claim, but does that mean they ought to change their name to "RAW Organic Food" as well? Methinks not.   So yeah, there's some lettuce, some vegetables, and there's even some pretty fine guacamole found in some menu items. But the name, "RAW Organic Food" implies there is RAW food cuisine; i.e., creative concoctions consistently of purely UNCOOKED foodstuffs, which are all the rage with health-minded foodies in Southern California and points beyond. Unfortunately, at this venue, there isn't a single menu item that is entirely RAW. Not one. (Probably because much of "raw" cuisine - particularly the liberal use of nuts in many recipes - isn't exactly dirt cheap on the budget.) I can't help but think that this was their strategy here: We'll call it "raw" and "organic," but we'll use ultra-low-grade ingredients (such as lentils instead of nuts) that have cut-rate prices, as low as Christmas trees the day AFTER Christmas; and like a silver-tongued snake oil salesman, we'll sell it all as high-quality "health" food - laughing all the way to the bank in the process!  And us good little lemmings/customers walked right into their phony "health" food ambush; like Custer at the Little Big Horn, which didn't turn out so well for him.   Just know that when your name itself is false advertising, and your business practices are in line with that methodology, you're following directly in the footsteps of P.T. Barnum himself. But hey, let's face it, this location is smack dab in THE local hotbed of people with heavenly bodies and head-turning faces that would put Helen of Troy to shame; and, I suspect, the name of the restaurant is taking full advantage of its location to lure in that type of crowd with the "RAW Organic food" motif. So, I ask you, why not have something, ANYTHING(!) on the menu, that would reflect the name, other than non-Organic juices?  P.T. Barnum said it well: There's a sucker born every minute. And this place is in very good standing with his quick-buck-artist mentality.   Though, by most accounts, the food here is decent, even if it's not actually "raw" nor "organic." And I would mostly concur with that from my experience. (Though, just imagine how delish it would be if they actually stuck to their name!) I'm of the mind that you can't go wrong with many of the RAW ingredients actually found here (even when you are scraping the bottom of the barrel with ultra-cheapo ingredients like this place), and I haven't been disappointed with the taste of the food, other than from the sour taste it leaves me from it being neither "raw" nor "organic," as advertised. So my main concern with this place, and the reason for my lowly 2-star rating, is the integrity issue.  Honest Abe said it best himself, "You can't fool all of the people all of the time." (I'm also not the only one here on Yelp saying these things about this place, including the very first review.) And the fact is that the apple, no matter how you slice it, does not fall far from the tree - all in a dishonest day's work.  Overall, I'm giving this place an extra star for having more veggies than McDonald's, but seriously, the name has to go. And honestly, this is NORTH SCOTTSDALE! We don't go here expecting to get McDonald's with vegetables, and we're willing to spend more than you typically would at McDonald's. Ultimately, this venue's big cost-cutting strategy, and the willingness to sacrifice health under the guise of it, is a big turnoff to me. Try making an honest buck and you'll see it feels better. A lot better.   A quiet conscience sleeps in thunder.  6/1/2014 REBUTTAL TO OWNER: 1)You're not actually "RAW" if you don't have any RAW food cuisine on your menu. This is beyond dispute. (If, e.g., using cheapskate lentils and cooking them into oblivion, instead having real RAW food, makes you "honest" about RAW, then what is "dishonesty"?) 2)Send me a list of your current suppliers and I guarantee I'll contact them and that I'll positively confirm your "organic" status in a revised review. I'll also be contacting them periodically and updating my review here, as necessary, to ensure you really are "honest." This would be a win-win for everyone.
4 I had the Tuscan chicken wrap; it has tender chicken, goat cheese, veggies, with a nice sauce and since I work in the building behind, get a small discount.  Very nice. It was delicious, the staff was very nice, reasonably priced. We wish them all the success, they deserve it.
4 I work near here and saw a groupon (two $10 vouchers for $12) and went for it. First time I had whatever the Mexican bowl is with added chicken and an almond awe smoothie (delicious) and then the 2nd time I had the sum yum bowl w/ added chicken (also delish). Both times the employees were friendly and I enjoyed my food. The food is clean / can be tailored to paleo and is therefore a great healthy, non GMO, gluten free lunch option for me.
1 I'm so sorry I didn't get to try the food but I just walked out without ordering about 5 minutes ago because the young man behind the counter had such an awful attitude. It was my first and last time in there and I will also encourage everyone I know not to go there. He was rude, short, unenthusiastic, and totally turned me off from ever eating there.
3 Although my food and drink have tasted good I'm not 100% convinced it's all organic. Every time I have gone in the service is very disjointed. The menu is confusing and employees aren't much help. I'm still on the fence about them, they are new so I'm waiting to see if they work out some kinks.
3 Second visit this morning. Smoothie was much better this time than last... Depends on who makes them on how flavorful they are... Only issue is the price... Seems pretty steep ..2 small smoothies $15 and change ( no extra protein or added ingredients ! )
2 Came here once before based on a review of the Almond Awe and that time it was everything as advertised - creamy, almondy and delicious. Today the one I bought was none of those things. What I got today was 90% ice, a little honey, a very small amount of almond milk, some fruit and no almonds. If Raw can't be consistent and/or train all staff how to make these things, I won't be spending my money here. If today's purchase was a result of cutting back on quality ingredients and adding more ice to make up for it, I definitely won't be back.
3 Omg so expensive!!!!!!!!! It makes wholefoods look cheap!!!!!!! We got 2 medium green juices that were actually pretty small and only filled up to about 3/4of the way and it was about $20. The service wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. I will say the juices were good, just not quite worth the $20. Unless the prices go down, I think I'll stick with wholefoods.
4 I love this place- the food is awesome and the staff is always really friendly. They opened a few months ago and the one thing that needs some improvement is the inconsistency with the portion sizes and pricing. Probably just growing pains. The salads and bowls are great. I haven't gotten any juices/smoothies- they do seem a little overpriced. It's awesome to have an all organic place like Raw close by!
4 First time at RAW. It's tasty, lots of options and I am very impressed its 100% organic. There are cheaper places, but you don't know if you are getting GMO or what. This seems legit. I'll be back with the wifey and kids.
