5 Rodman helped us get our van fixed and even when the part was defective stood behind their work and did the labor for free to get it done right. great people I can trust here.
1 After having the transmission replaced in my husband's 1979 Dodge Power Wagon, the truck has been back to this shop three times for leaking transmission fluid. Having paid almost $2K and having taken it back multiple times to have it made right, they will not make any further repairs and even threatened to call the cops if we came back to the shop. Their incompetence to get the job handled correctly as well as verbally abusing my husband has made this a true horror story. Not once did my husband raise his voice, make threats or cuss however he was called multiple explicit terms by Rodman, the owner, and was hung up on. We simply wanted what we paid for or a refund and instead we were called names, not given any kind of refund and on top of it the transmission still leaks. Ironically it wasn't leaking when we first brought it in. Do not go here unless you want to overpay for shoddy workmanship from rude people who won't back their own written warranty.
1 Patriot Transmission ?  On 12/3/08 I took my 1984 El Camino into there shop for a Transmission Shift Cable that they replaced.  The problem with that visit was that my floor shift handle came off in my hand.  Before I could move my vehicle, I had to take my console out to put it into gear to drive it back to them.  They fixed  it on the spot... I will give them that one.  I took my car back on 11/27/13 for them to fix transmission leaks.  The owner said there were 8 oil leaks around the transmission oil pan and he said it would cost $500.00 to fix it and he would guarantee it never to leak again.  About 5 months later on 4/24/14 or 433 miles later, I took my vehicle to another auto mechanic to fix the front and/or rear seals because I still had a leak.  The seals were fine but the transmission pan was still leaking, and they showed me, so I drove it back to Patriot's.  And YES I was MAD.  The owner could not see where it was leaking, when I seen it 10 minutes prior.  He threatened to call the cops and through me off his property.  I left and will never do business with Patriot's Transmission again.  This is nothing more than a Money Game to them.  They conceder Return Business as "Doing the Job Right the Second Time"... if that.                       VETERANS and EVERYONE ELSE BEWARE !
1 I had my transmission rebuilt and 23 months and 24,700 miles later it quit.  It lasted exactly 700 miles past its warranty.  I was sold on the promises that they expected a whole lot more than 24,000 miles on the transmission, especially after $1800.  I didnt expect a free rebuild, but I did expect some relief on the price of doing it again.
