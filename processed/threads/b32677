5 First of all, what a beautiful salon! The place was very relaxing and modern. Hossai does a fantastic job with color. I definitely recommend seeing her for color and cute.
1 I bought a groupon for this business and have left FOUR voicemails asking to make an appointment. Last Saturday, I finally got ahold of someone who answered the phone by saying "hello?" as if it was a cell phone or a home phone, not a business. Pretty unprofessional. When I asked to make an appointment for the next Monday, she stated they were booked for 2 weeks. When I said I was hoping to be seen sooner the girl stated "Well you're using a groupon, so other customers have priority scheduling." I asked to speak to a manager, the girl said she was Nancy, but Nancy was not in the office. I just hung up. I have left voicemails asking to be called back but nothing. Completely unprofessional. Why have a groupon offer if you will look down to the customers who purchase it? Snobby and unprofessional business practices!
