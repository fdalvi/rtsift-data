4 Very tasty thin crust.
2 Tried the order on line thing at this Domino's near my NLV pad...Web site was so-so...I am a very computer literate person but it took me several clicks to figure out how to move on in this site...Could be even easier for the layman...Anyway, now have a complete full profile with Domino' s and next order should be a tad easier...I got to the location within ten minutes and at the counter had a bit of a run around by the young lady...She said there was NO order in my name...I was getting steamed as I looked into her "deer in the headlights" look...Why, oh why must these fast food places stock the place with near idiots...Pay a bit more for a little less staff and get some folks with smarts and watch the efficiency skyrocket...Three minutes in my frustration mode the manager came forward and said the lady had mislabeled the boxes ready to hold MY order...I WAS in the computer and I had my grub in two more minutes...Pan pizza, Italian sandwich and lava cake set me back about twenty-two bucks...Food quality?  Was just "C-" level...Blood pressure?  On the rise thanks to less than capable staff...Hopefully next time I grace Domino's porch for some quick grub it goes a bit better...
1 I place an order askind for jalapeñes only on half of my pizza, when they delivery it was full of jalapeños.   My husband call and ask to talk to a manager she said that she made the pizza her self and that apperantly they can NOT put only an ingredient on half of a pizza. We know for a fact that it can be done because we always place orders with half jalapeños for the kids.  She answer in a very rude way.  Then we call back and placed an other order by phone and 20 min later they call to make sure the order was legit.
5 Been using their computer ordering system with tremendous success...Today I screwed up the order and a real live person from the store called to confirm what I really wanted...Kudos Domino's for getting it really right!
