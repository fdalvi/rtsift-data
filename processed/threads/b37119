4 This place accepts mobile payments. :-)
4 This Starbucks is almost always busy. The staff are friendly and fast though so the wait doesn't seem bad. Clean and quick! Nice location.
4 KUDOS:   -Inside of  Target, my second favorite store. -Closest Starbucks to my job. -Shop at Target during your lunch hour and get your fix on the way out. -Not busy at all.  GRIPES: -It's inside of Target.  No drive-thru--what?  Oh well, can't have it all.
5 Salted caramel mocha frapp...... Heaven.  The woman working today, was polite and kind... and I was able to get a drink today before a line formed! This place gets sooo busy! The only downside, is that the drinks to me, don't always taste the same... the consistency is off...(from worker to worker in this location) .I should know, because I order the same drink every, single, time.
4 As good as a real Starbucks. Good service, good products, reasonable prices, and nice staff.  REMEMBER... This is NOT a real Starbucks. This is a franchised store owned and operated by Target. So things may occasionally be different than in a corporate owned store. This includes training of the baristas. They don't go through typical Starbucks training, so they won't always know the entire menu and how to properly prepare things.
