5 Wonderful salon!!! Love it me and my mom are in love with this place!! Cece and kim are so awesome and tony is a hoot!! I definitely recommend this place to all my friends and family and fellow yelpers!! Make sure to mention you found it on yelp!
4 This is a great nail salon!! The staff is soo sweet & friendly and the atmosphere is great. They either are playing a movie or good music on the TV which I like. The salon is very clean and well kept. They give a hand & back massage with your nail service that goes above & beyond the norm! The only reason I deducted 1 star is bc whatever brand of gel polish they use does not last well on my nails and chips fast, so I don't get a gel mani here anymore. Other than that this place is wonderful!
