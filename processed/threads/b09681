4 So far this place has been good to me. A couple of people from work recommended this place to me so I had them put in new spark plugs and new brakes. The mechanic told me that I could have gone some more miles in the spark plugs I had but I changed them anyways it had been a couple of years. Also going back to them for oil changes.  They are reasonable on prices and don't pressure you to do things on your car you don't need.  Only thing is they are a little far from work and although they don't pressure you, they do write out a quote for what they think you need done on your car. Slightly annoying.
5 This is an auto mechanic shop in Avondale that rocks! I just had to have some auto repairs done to my car.   Best part was that they quoted me a price but actually charged me less when I showed up because they were able to do the work cheaper than they thought.   When was the last time an auto repair shop charged you less than what they quoted? It can be hard to find a trustworthy auto mechanic these days so I'm really glad I found this place. I hope I don't need any repairs in the near future but if and when I do, this will be the auto repair shop in Avondale that I will be using.
5 Have taken my ford probe here a few times and they always get it back to its old self. Great service and great work.
1 Disappointed that I was told that my car would need a $540 alternator replacement and that new battery replacement would not work. My car has been running great when I was told the new battery was going to immediately die because of the alternator. I did not get the alternator replaced and had it tested elsewhere and was told my alternator was fine. I feel like I was preyed upon because I'm a female and my car has a lot of mileage.
