2 Mr Burrito moved into Salsitas.   Drove in to get my usual breakfast burritos.  Got a shock at the window, the prices doubled!!   Then after waiting 15 minutes.  The glazed girl at the window forgot half my order and gave me the " What are you talking about look"   She mentioned a new owner and then I got worried.   I got fuzzy scorched eggs with a tiny amount of meat. No Cheese no NADA!   Their salsa is nasty.  Nothing worse then scorched eggs.  Twice the cost and bad food.  Such a deal.    Back to FILIBERTOS!
1 1. My Carne Asada was grilled, hard tortilla, dry, just nasty. 2. I paid 5.50 for it! :/ 3. Salsa didn't help much
4 I stumbled across this restaurant when looking for food on a Sunday.  Nothing was open nearby but this Mexican restaurant so I thought I'd give it a try.  I ordered a Chimichanga meal which was very large and filling.  The food was very good for the money ($7) and the lady server was very nice.  There are TVs in the restaurant but none of them were working at the time.  If you want a quick bite of Mexican food, come here!
