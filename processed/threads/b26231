4 Atlantic's FBO is great if you have some time to kill before your flight. There are a few large conference/computer rooms as well as private areas and a "Fuel Cafe" on-site that makes horrible oatmeal, but decent paninis and excellent fries.
5 It has a nice snack bar deli up front and helpful assistance out to the private jet. If you've landed here, they let the limo on the tarmac. From landing to limo in less than 20 minutes.  Thankfully there are several computers up front for the pilots to check the weather and get their flight plans. The runway is attached to the main Las Vegas airport so it can get a little busy. There's plenty of space to park many jets and smaller aircraft.
5 Excellent location for easy access to the strip.  Good transportation to hotels.  Landed, deplaned, transferred luggage to the car and left.  Whole process took minutes and was very efficient.
5 This always our fav spot to park our corporate aircraft while in Vegas. Is within easy walking distance of MGM, where I like to stay. Best Of service, every time, for all our pax and crew needs. Thanks folks. Well done.
