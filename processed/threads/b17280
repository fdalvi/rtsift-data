5 I loved the vegetarian selection, and the prices were quite reasonable for Vegas dining!  I liked it so much I dragged my friends in for a second meal here. I had:  -potato & onion omelette/tortilla espanola -marinated manchego cheese/queso manchego al romero -spicy potatoes with tomato alioli/patatas bravas -goat cheese baked in tomato sauce/queso de cabra al horno -mushroom empanada, porcini alioli/empanada de setas -roasted red pepper spanish pizza -black raspberry sangria  The porcini alioli was heavenly! My two favorite dishes were the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, and the mushroom empanada. The Spanish pizzas are a surprisingly good deal (lots of food for not too much).   I looooooooved the sangria.

3 I'm so sad that they closed this place down and turned it into a Mexican cantina. They had the best tapas and sangria happy hour in Las Vegas!
