2 I love the chesse bread there. Some of the employees/ Manager are the worst for customer services. If you get the deep dish pizza just be careful it might be burnt on the bottom.
3 My reccomendation: Italian Cheese Bread  Maybe I got there right after a big rush or something because absolutely nothing was "hot-n-ready". I had to wait for my pizzas and italian cheese bread. Took about 15-20 minutes.   I don't expect gourmet quality for a 5 dollar pizza, but geez, if they charged as much as other pizza places then Little Caesars would go out of business QUICK. Little Caesars pizza is strictly for someone looking for cheap/quick food. I honestly think most pizzas found in your local grocery store's freezers taste leagues above Caesars.   The Italian cheese bread is really good though. It is by far better tasting than the pizza but make sure you grab plenty of napkins and are stocked up on Proactiv because this dish's main ingredient is grease with a side of oil.  Customer service was good. The guy was very nice and funny. He was very apologetic for making me wait and even threw in a free bag of Crazy Bread.
3 So don't judge me but I have never in life had Little Caesars Pizza until recently.  I will say that I definitely wasn't missing out on anything big or grand. However, for $5 for a Hot & Ready Large Pepperoni Pizza it was a good deal.  The pizza itself had way more pepperoni on it than I thought it would. Definitely a lot of bread and not a super cheesy pizza, but for $5 I am not going to cry about it. It fed my family for dinner one night and at a great price if you ask me.  We also got a side of the cheesy bread sticks and those were pretty good.   The location itself is pretty busy, so the parking lot can sometimes be tight. And you are bound to see some interesting characters.
2 No Supreme, hot or ready. Little Caesars needs to get it's stuff together. Seriously disappointing customer service at almost every location we've tried, including this one.
