4 This pawn shop is down the street from me, and in the same parking lot as Trader Joe's, so I'll stop in here from time to time to browse their items.  They have a really small space, but there's plenty of camcorders and iPods and the like.  I just bought something from them after they listed it on Craigslist.  Amazing price, and I probably wouldn't have gotten it at such a good price if they had a bigger store since they were holding it in the back.  It was priced at $249, but they listed it on Craigslist for $200, and I ended up paying $185+tax.
3 My first time in a pawn shop!  They evaluate the item using standard measures to ensure authenticity, etc. took about 5-7 minutes this trip. Only 3 other people were there. Not sure they're the best in town but I would feel comfortable tring to buy/sell here. They do loans at 13% interest and $5 handling fee.
4 I've done business with this pawn shop five or six times.  I have always left happy.  So many pawn shops have rude staff, barely give you any money and are slow or have a bunch of weird policies.  This place is friendly, fast, and has always given me a fair amount of money when I want to pawn or sell my stuff.
