1 Only, if you've broken your leg in Haymarket and the only way you can fix it is with Spring Rolls, visit Chinese cuisine. The food is awful, greasy brown mess and I waited like 20 minutes for it.  Avoid.
3 Located in the heart of Haymarket, Eastern Cuisine is ideal for satisfying your late night cravings to great Chinese food.  The staff are friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming with celan, fresh decor.   The menu has everthing which you would expect from your average Chinese with plenty of meat dishes and whole range of sauces.  However, there are quite limited options for vegetarians as there are very few dishes with only vegetables. I went for the beef Kung Po with boiled rice and a bag of prawn crackers.  It cost only about Â£7 and the sauce was delicious when it arrived.  The beef was a little tough and sinewy which took a little away from it.   Nonetheless, it's a pretty good takeaway with reasonable prices.
