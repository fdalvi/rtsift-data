2 I stop at this 7-Eleven more often then I'd like, only because it's the one I pass most often. It's kinda shady. Scratch that, it's super shady.   It seems like every time I stop before work for an iced coffee there are multiple people inside playing the slot machines. Who gambles at 6 am at a convenience store?! Hendertucky residents, apparently.   Service is spotty, some employees act like working there makes them want to die and others are actually pleasant.   No gas pumps, but there is a Red Box out front, so that' a plus. I have absolutely experienced better though.
3 A lot of things at 7-11 are pretty pricey. Milk, eggs, ice cream...unless you are desperate, I don't recommend getting them here. The man who helped me was happy, and glad to help me check out.
2 This place is crazy busy all the time! The only reason why I rate it a three is the cool blonde chick that works during the night. I stop and get a drink and cigarettes in the morning and this place is usually always dirty, and rarely has my cigarettes and the employees are too consumed with their cellphones or each other than customers. The employees during the day shoot the sh*t and ignore customers. They look miserable and I get it, I work at a gas station but come on!! This is the closest place to my house but starting to rethink my pit stop to the chevron down the street  Oh and the parking lot sucks!
