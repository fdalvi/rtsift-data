4 I really enjoy this shop. Its definitely. Pricey, but high quality so i feel its worth it for the bird seed maybe not the feeders. But backyard birders should definitely check it out
4 Best birdseed in town. Love their feeders but they ARE overpriced a bit.
5 Great selection of birdseed, birdhouses, books, and other fun wildlife-related gifts. Yes, they may cost more than eBay, but you get great service from the staff who are helpful in answering questions. They are knowledgable and happy to help.
