4 Beautiful stuff in here, less little miscellaneous items than its next door neighbor, World Market, more furniture and housewares.  If I don't get in here very often, Xmas is the time to come.  I was just going to look around but ended up buying several of their fragrance beads on sale, and a  couple of small versions of the infusion incense sticks in peppermint and gingerbread.  Some will be gifts and a couple for me.  That's how I shop.
4 What a great home furnishing store! They sell lots of lively, cheery, yet sophisticated/contemporary home furnishings and accessories. I love the jewel-toned mosaic tables and fluffy accent pillows here. They are also one of the few stores I've seen that sell double papasan chairs (If you've never tried one, go here. They are so comfy!) On my most recent trip, I took home an adorable owl door mat. Just what we needed for our new home. :)
3 HOME DECOR AND MOAR!  i enjoy watching all of the "i just discovered yoga" types walk around looking at stuff.  my tail was to big for the displays.  serenity now!
