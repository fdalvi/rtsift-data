5 This store is amazing!  I needed a "one of a kind" "interesting" piece of furniture for my living room.  I stopped into this store on my way to Costco on Hayden and found the perfect thing!  The detail on this cabinet was incredible!  If only I could post a photo!   The family that owns this business is really nice and very knowledgeable about everything on the floor!   I highly recommend this store for interesting, beautiful home furnishings!
5 They have beautiful things that no one else will have in their home.  I really enjoyed looking around in here.
5 Beautiful unique things and sales lady was awesome, cheerful and friendly! A little out of the beaten path but thanks to yelp we found this great place!
5 After having sticker shock from another store very close to Eclectic Home, I stopped in to see what they had.  I was THRILLED!  I found several pieces of furniture at 1/3 of the cost.  June was great to work with and very helpful!  I will shop there often!  If you are looking for things that look like Restoration Hardware, it is a must stop!  One of a kind items for sure!
5 If you are in the market for unique, one-of-a-kind furniture stop into Eclectic Home.  Not only was I pleasantly surprised by how reasonable their prices were their selection was outstanding!  Loved the friendly customer service too from this family owned business.  Will definitely shop there again!
