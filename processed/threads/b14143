5 I was referred to them by a close a friend of mine who uses them all the time. I have to tell you I was super impressed with there price and turn around. I ordered something and the next day it was engraved and ready to go.
5 COLLEEN AND HER STAFF ARE AWESOME!!!   I have all my business logs embroidered on shirts and they are always done in a timely manor and LOOK WONDERFUL! I wouldn't use anyone else!
5 I love Colleen and her staff! I always go here when I need something engraved or embroidered. Everyone is so friendly and professional. I recommend them all the time and continue to use them for anything I need.
5 I couldn't be anymore happy with the quality  work I received from Colleen and her staff. I was recommended by a close friend whom had precious engravings done for some awards. And I'm happy to say I listened, because I had amazing experience from the moment I walked in. There's nothing better then timely and efficient work, but when you see the quality results... Well that's just icing on the cake. Definitely recommend for any engraving needs!!
5 Hands on customer service. Always will return for my engraving needs.
