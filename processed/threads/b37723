4 Well, let me get the obvious out of the way: this is a sandwich shop inside a gas station. Yeah, that seems kinda shady, but don't be so quick to dismiss Roy's!  The bread is good (it comes from Great Buns - yay for delicious and double yay for supporting a local bakery!). The meat and cheese are good, although they pretty much just have the usuals (ham, salami, turkey, roast beef, tuna, I think).  There's a good selection of veggie toppings.  The sandwiches are fresh made as you order.  There's an excellent selection of fountain drinks (duh).  Service is friendly and quick. Prices are awesome! $4.99 for a sandwich, bag of chips, and a drink. There is a small seating area inside if you need a break, but it's probably much more enjoyable to eat at home.  Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to visit Roy's, but it's definitely a solid sandwich option if you're in the area.
5 The best around can't beat the prices,  friendly service, very clean, I go by whenever possible! If you want a sandwich or a snack, gas or even a car wash, go by,  they even have crushed ice for soft drinks!
5 As a "Regular" here !(Between 6a-2p M-F)  I am ADDICTED to their Awesome deli sandwiches that Crystal or Beth make for me  just about everyday !! They even heat the bacon up for ya !!  Everybody is so friendly there. It's a great place to start your day....
