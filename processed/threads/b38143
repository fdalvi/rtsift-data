5 These people literally charge $40 an hour for ANY sort of cleaning. I had them work on my apartment for 3 hours and it was the best money I have spent in a long time.
5 I've used Kleen Geeks for two years and every single time I am impressed with the service. They are prompt, professional and make our home look beautiful!
1 I have out-of-town guests coming this weekend so I scheduled Kleen Geeks a month in advance.  I even reminded them of the appointment last week.  They assured me they would be there.  When no one showed up, I started calling: 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours past their appointment time.  Not only did they not show up, but no one answered the phone or returned their voicemails.  I am really, really disappointed.
