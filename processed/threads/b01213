3 This is the "other" Coffee Plantation that I always forget about even though it is right by where I grew up. Weird, huh?  Actually, it isn't weird. Because this Coffee Plantation blends into its stripmall surroundings so seamlessly that you totally forget it's there. They take absolutely  no chance with decor or ambiance. For all you know, it's part of the laundromat next door.   Coffee isn't bad and it never seems to be too busy so it's actually an undercover great spot to get some things done without worry of distraction. Not sure of the wifi situation, but a good book on a rainy afternoon and this place would suit you well.
1 Ok so I was going to a movie and I really wanted a coffee.  The nearest thing was coffee plantation.  I got a cup, one sip and I was the keystone bitter beer face guy!  This coffee was like if Propel made coffee water.  This was the most watered down coffee I've ever tasted in my life.  NEVER DRINK IT!!
1 THIS LOCATION IS NOW CLOSED.  Not that anyone was thinking of going there...
