5 The only club car dealers in the area. Great customer service and always helping the best they can. If your on the market for a golf cart (gas or electric) and want the best, come here for a club car golf cart and you'll be glad you did.
4 No matter the age of your cart, regardless if you purchased from them, they will cure what ails it.  Great customer service, and they genuinely seemed to care about taking care of their customers.  This is my spot to get my cart serviced when I'm down at my winter place.
1 As a previous rater acknowledged, this is the only Club Car dealer in the area. This is unfortunate. Several things bugged me about this place. They overprice their new carts, then heavily discount them (kinda like cheap used car dealers of old.) But the real issue for me was the service department and dealership management. They did not listen and therefore prescribed the wrong fix at inflated pricing. When I asked questions in an attempt to get them to better understand the issue, I was told, "maybe you should just fix it yourself." In addition the service department was very dirty and seemed disorganized. The experience led me to leave their facility, do some research, and actually fix it myself. Their quote was $2000, my cost ended up at $750. The combination of incompetence and arrogance at this place must come from their near monopoly in Phoenix for Club Car. I would push my car off a cliff and buy an EZGO before I would ever do business with them.
