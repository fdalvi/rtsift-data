4 Just a little dive on Indian School Rd. with a lot of history. Now I might have been born here, but I grew up in SoCal! My father was born and raised here, never leaving this area. He had told me a story how as a little boy is mother sent him to the neighbors to get some tamales. As it turns out it was Sylvia? He was a devoted customer and has brought some of their food home to share with me. I really enjoyed their tamales and chili Verde! Wife and daughter enjoys their enchiladas, their sauce is almost like a mole sauce. Over all, very good food, location is not that great, but don't be scared!
2 Normally this place is pretty good (red chili burritos) but the prices seem to be rising, and the service and food has been lacking as of late. Went by for a navajo taco a couple of weeks ago and they were out. What? Today, out of Pepsi. The red chili burrito was good, but the boat of their flour chips were disgusting and were immediately tossed in the garbage. They were STALE (who knows how old they were) and tasted like they were fried in rancid oil. If they can't be bothered to offer fresh chips (they aren't cheap!) they shouldn't be on the menu! And if they weren't a few miles away, I would have went back for a refund! Get it together Sylvia's!
2 Went for lunch today and never got my order.  After 20 minutes of waiting and watching three groups after us get their orders, I went up to ask about my food.  My colleague already got his order (we ordered together and I paid for the entire order), but mine somehow "disappeared".  I was told they were really busy and that one of their employees had left.  Usually their food is pretty good, but they didn't seem to care about service at all.  I never got my food...my colleague had finished and we had to get back to work.  I asked for my money back, and when I got back to the office realized they shorted me 57 cents.  I WILL NOT GO BACK!!
