4 Everybody writes a song about killing themselves while waiting forever at the DMV. I think I wrote 6........ Besides the fact that it takes all day to get seen I actually enjoyed the company of my government representative. I enlightened her day with a little sarcastic comedy & from that point forward she was a pleasure to have to work with. I always choose a 3rd party DMV for the convenience of getting in & out in10 but when u have no choice it's nice to have an optimistic employee to deal with.
3 As far as DMV's go, this one isn't bad. The wait wasn't too long and the couple of employees I talked with seemed very friendly. Generally speaking the bar isn't set to high when you're talking about the DMV, but this experience was decent.
1 Amazingly unorganized.  I waited three hours to be told the documentation I had to register ab off road vehicle was not acceptable.  They said to come back to station 6 and I wouldn't have to wait.  Returned. .. was required to get a number and wait another hour.  Use third party if at all possible!
