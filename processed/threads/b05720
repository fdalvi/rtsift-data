2 Coworker gave rave reviews about this company, I choose to drive out to this location as it had the soonest availability.   Made an appointment for adult acne with Dr. Hall. Waited for an hour and a half in the waiting room, and only saw the doc for two maybe three minutes (wasn't in the consultation room for more than 5mins). He shined a light and looked at my skin, went to his chair and asked me a few questions bout what I had used in the past, gave me some prescriptions and I was ushered out. Maybe my old dermatologist was extra special, as he would do extractions and detailed consolations... Not just give me a script, I could have done that for half the price with my GP.
1 horrible,  horrible,  horrible customer service!!! they only care about money... not their patients! !! do not go there!!!!!
1 Front desk staff acts more like giggly 12 years olds rather than professionals.  I saw Dr. Brent Michaels for maaaybe 2 minutes max!  He told the nurse to write the name down so I could Google it.  "It's nothing to worry about... Google this name..." is particularly underwhelming.  My insurance company paid HOW MUCH for this 2 minute visit?!
