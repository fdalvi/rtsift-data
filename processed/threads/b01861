3 Tip: nachos here are bomb, yes gas station nachos. When you want care less about your health, load up on nacho and chili cheese. Also tamales in green chili and horchata at this location.
2 Place is alright. I was in a hurry and needed gas, but if you get Chevron, you're better off going to the one on Kyrene or Rural on Baseline. A lot cheaper compared to this one.
3 I stop by here often. The employees are very polite and fast at assisting customers. The prices seem higher here for most items than other gas stations but I assume that is because it is close to a freeway exit.
