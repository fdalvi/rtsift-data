5 Well 1st off I'd like to say amazing!  He is an awesome OB and Such a caring Doctor!  He returns calls promptly a smaller practice which insures you'll get an appointment and he is never over booked! They will also call and reschedule your appointment if he is called to a delivery not leaving you waiting for hrs... Which is great!  I love Dr Lopez he is awesome!
5 Dr Luis Lopez was very caring took the time to talk to me. Office was very clean. I didn't have to wait a long time for my appointment. Great staff too.
1 This was my second and LAST visit to Dr. Lopez-Benitez for an annual Pap smear. I wanted to discuss Peri-menopause with him and asked several times to have my hormone levels tested, he refused, dismissing me by saying "Why even check it, it won't change my mind about anything". He was not interested in my concerns in the slightest. When I did push him to answer my questions, he rolled his eyes. Ladies we have more choices out there and I personally think that given a choice, we should choose someone that takes the time to answer our questions, especially when it comes to reproduction. It felt like going back into a 1950's Dr. office. His staff was also rude, short and unconcerned. They were too busy with their personal phone calls to take care of patients.
5 Clean office with a friendly an inviting environment. The staff is very sweet and organized. Dr. Luis J Lopez was very patient and knowledgeable about all my concerns and questions. This was my first appointment with them and the in-processing paperwork took only a few minutes. I would recommend him to everyone.
4 If you're looking to get a yearly pap smear done in 20 minutes, this is your doctor. There isn't those long waits usually associated with going to the gyno but,to be honest, he was a little rougher than I'm used to. Still, totally worth it to put a check mark on my yearly vaginal checklist.
