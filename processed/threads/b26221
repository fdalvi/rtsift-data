4 One of my many local gas/quick stop places that I frequent! It's always clean which is great and it sells Shell gasoline (which is one of my preferred brands) I really don't have a bad thing to say about the place, but if you get a chance stop by ;)
2 One of the few gas stations in Vegas that doesn't sell 40 oz beers or single tall cans.  Everyone else in town does, why don't you fools sell it?
1 You would like to give them the benefit of doubt but the constantly mark items on sale with signs but charge you more at the counter. I have complained several times but it's like groundhogs day.
