2 I'd been looking forward to trying this place since it opened, and tonight seemed like as good a night as any!  I was the only customer, and the high school kid working was very friendly.    Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the actual yogurt.  They have a larger selection of flavors compared to some other yogurt places, so I tried three flavors: pistachio, chocolate, and coconut.  The pistachio was...weird.  It didn't taste like pistachios, or like any pistachio ice cream or yogurt I've ever tasted.  It was tart and just very strange.  The coconut was overpowering--very sweet and almost chemical-like.  I think the chocolate was fine, but I only just managed to taste it; it was almost totally overwhelmed by the coconut.  The toppings choices were lacking compared to other area choices.  Fewer options both for fruit and non-fruit.  Price was the standard $.42 per ounce.    All things considered, I'm not impressed.  Oh well.
1 I would put a zero if I could. I went twice. Just because the first time was sooo bad I thought I was dreaming. Second time made me want to hurt myself for walking back into this place.  Both times it was hot (Hello, we live in AZ), A/C was either off or the place is doing so bad they can't afford A/C. Second time I went, I got two flavors, The Orange Mango & something else couldn't remember because the first flavor went out. My first choice was raspberry, but when I pulled the lever, boom, the dang thing Exploded and my clothes were ruined. Booo so mad. The girl that was helping me saw all this, and she still charged me full price....  So My expert advice is to drive to YoLove or Dlite..... Stay away
1 Went by at 6pm on a Saturday. Sign said their hours were until 9pm that day. Lights out. No one in sight. Whole shopping complex was a ghost town. Not sure if this place is closed for business or if they changed their hours and didn't make the change on their sign.
