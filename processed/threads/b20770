4 Quite simply, Tesco in Corstorphine gets 4 starts simply for being open 24 hrs.   Honestly, I'd prefer to do my grocery shopping at smaller retailers such as specialist butchers, bakeries, fishmongers, fruit and veg and the like...but sometimes, often at weird times of the day (especially if you have kids!)...you need to find some place open carrying a wide range of whatever...and as we all know, sometimes you just have a craving to buy a 50" LED 3D TV at 3.15am...
5 As far as large supermarkets go, this is at the pinnacle of achievement. Let's ignore the fact that the shop has destroyed local business and annihilated the main street in Corstorphine and review it in comparison to other giant supermarket outlets.    It has everything. Clothes, fridges, celeriac, bin bags, spectacles, dentist, bank, bakery, fishmongers, coffee place, toys, booze, frozen food, petrol, Gaviscon.... The list goes on, almost endlessly. And it's open 24 hours.   Staff are usually really helpful and always manage to point me in the right direction for whatever weird little item I've come in for. I realise it's Tesco, but for what it does it does it incredibly well. No wonder this brand is taking over the UK, street corner by street corner.
5 Clean, tidy, well stocked & has a Costa! 5.983 Stars!
