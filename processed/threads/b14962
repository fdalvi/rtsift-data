5 I have know Susan for over a year and have always found her very knowledgable about any questions that I have had regarding signage.  I have referred several people to her and none of them have been disappointed with what they bought.
5 Danna & Kat were both a pleasure to work with. The sign is fantastic! I highly recommend this company - very professional.
5 Top notch customer service, great quality and turnaround time! I was happy to find Danna through a friend's recommendation and they did a great job with wonderful customer service!   Couldn't be happier! We will be back!
2 Susan and Danna sold the business and the new owners are really struggling, it took me over a week to get an estimate and I couldn't approve it because it was written up wrong AND I never received another one fixed SO~  I found another printer and they are great!
