3 Very good icecream shop to stop at before you hit up the movies or just want to hang out! Had the chocolate chip cookie dough in a waffle cone, very very good!
1 Look, let's face it, Maggie Moo. You never even stood a chance.  Your flavors are pedantic and unimaginative, your service is lackluster and disheartening, and your prices defy logic.  It's fucking ice cream, and not even good ice cream. I wouldn't know. Maybe if you took better care maintaining your merchandise, it wouldn't taste so terrible.  Whether the flavor's "too soft" or "too hard" it requires you take the reserve tray out of the freezer and serve some of that to me instead.   So apparently your display case is just that. Display.  Your mix-ins are lame and stale. M&M's and sprinkles? Gee, don't give yourself a fucking aneurysm with all this creativity.   So you really didn't have much going for you already by the time your cashier called me "sir". TWICE.   The second time was my fault though. I tried to intervene and correct her.  "is that all for you, sir?" "Um...it's ma'am, actually. I'm a girl." "Oh. I'm sorry, sir!"  If I hadn't said anything I would've only been offended the one time. Mea culpa.  It's not entirely that girl's fault I'm giving you one star, but it certainly helped convince.  You'd be well informed to know I'm writing a letter. Not to your manager or anything.   But to Coldstone Creamery. Begging them back.  I figure why be with a knock-off of a piece of garbage when I can just be with the real deal, you know.  Ha ha! Who am I kidding.   This one event will probably deter me from ice cream all together.   I'll need to set "Gelato & Frozen Custard" on the "Ice Cream Orientation" box on all my social profiles.
