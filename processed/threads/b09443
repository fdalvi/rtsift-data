4 I have been going to Dr. Kim for over a month now and have found him to be a very good acupuncturist and a very good person.  As I enter, I receive a warm hello from the receptionist, and sit in a comfortable waiting area for very little time, and most of the time, I am immediately greeted by Dr. Kim and walked back to a room.  Each of the rooms are quiet, clean, and have light music playing to help me relax.  Dr. Kim takes the time to talk with me and gladly answers any questions I have.   I feel very comfortable recommending him to others, as he was recommended to me by a friend who also goes there.  The office is shared with one (maybe two) other acupuncturists who seem to be as nice as Dr. Kim.  I give this place a thumbs up!
4 Needles and skin do not go hand and hand,but you would never know that you were a human pin cushion, Dr. Kim is quick and painless. Each session I end up relaxed and the energy flowing. As he explains "he treats the body from inside out instead of from outside in."   He also uses Moxibustion, this was the first time I tried this technique and although I have no idea how it actually works it is supposed to aid in stimulating the circulatory system.  Some like the smell of this herb some may not, I suggest trying it.
5 Dr. Kim is a kind and talented healer.  He has helped me with chronic lower back pain in the past and most recently he helped me get relief for blocked inner tubes which resulted from a sinus infection.  I had been seeking help from my family physician for several weeks with no results, but Dr. Kim helped me find relief after only two sessions.  I leave his office feeling calm, energized and with a sense of well-being.  I have recommended him to all my friends and family. Thank you, Dr. Kim!
