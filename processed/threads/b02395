2 I've had many problems with the service at this location.  The employees are nice but they regularly mess up my order and the bun's on the hamburgers are always soggy.  They also usually take a long time to get my order out to me.  I'd actually recommend eating at the Burger King on Country Club and I-60 instead.
2 I love the chicken sandwich there, but everytime I get it's very dry and when you go thru the drive thru they are extremely slow.
1 THEY DON'T WEAR GLOVES.  I watched a lanky kid behind the counter scratch his face then shove some stray fries into their container with the same bare face-scratching hands.  I was mildly grossed out.  Then I realized the fries belonged to me.  Now we're beyond mild.  This is ready-to-eat food.  Being exposed to all the face-scratching, sneezing, money-handling, and other random contaminants out there.   I wanted salt, not Hepatitis A seasoning my fries  So I did the unthinkable.  I brought it up.  And when I did, I was told glove-wearing is a manager's choice.  Well, going there is a customer's choice, so I'll definitely be finding my dinner elsewhere.  Disgusting.
