1 I live in the area, so it's not uncommon I hit up Safeway for early morning/late night grocery runs. As a full time student and worker, those are really the only times I get to waste time shopping at the store. And I mean waste in every sense of the word.   Every.single.time. I go to this particular location I remind myself I'll never go back. Yes, I said NEVER, but living down the street and this being the closest grocery store, never really means I won't go back this week. So I find myself returning -- abusee/abuser relationship much? and my experience never changes. Anytime I'm at this location, there is only one checkout aisle open. Yes, I said that - ONE. So I quickly pick up the items I need-- you know, bread, milk, water, maybe a snack or two and then I painfully wait in line for what seems like an eternity - hey once I even watched hair grow on my legs as I waited... jk- but really 20 minutes go by and I finally get to the checkout. Plug in an old phone number for my Safeway card and finalize my painstakingly long order.  After writing this review I sure hope I'll smarten up and just go to infinitely better stores (Sprouts or Fresh & Easy) down the road!
2 Ditto to what Nicole said every time I come here I ask myself why I did it again. At a grocery store you should be able to go in and out just to buy a gallon of milk or sometime like that. Not here you are guaranteed to wait in a 15min line with only 1 cashier. This place is in dyer need for more cashiers. Otherwise go to the 24h frys on baseline and power.
