3 Good food and clean, my issue was the 2 girls working spent the entire time talking to each other.  Brianna made a good sandwich but because she was talking she kept forgetting what I ordered and had to repeat it a few times.
4 Good service, clean. Really liked the service very nice and fast. No flat bread though kinda made me sad but oh we'll. great subway
