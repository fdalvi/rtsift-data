4 Church's keeps sending me coupons that seem to be amazing in value, such as the one I headed out with on this visit for a 2-piece meal including a leg, thigh, mashed potatoes & gravy, & a biscuit for $1.99!  (Reg. $4.99 inc. a drink.)  I finally got curious enough to whip over there this morning & try it.  The chicken here is crispy, & you choose between original recipe & spicy.  I went with the spicy, & it was spicy but not "hot hot".  My order came up almost immediately as I paid, & the chicken pieces were surprisingly large!  They were also cooked just right, & tasty.  The mashed potatoes & biscuit were good, too.  I had every expectation of giving this place 2 Stars, maybe 3, but as good as it was, plus fast, friendly service & an amazing price with the pretty much always available coupons, I'm an instant fan!     :-))
4 Enroute this morning to the health food store for some natural, GMO free, high fructose corn syrup free, gluten free, organic, low fat, low sodium, free range, fair labor, Kosher, Halal, vegan tofu fortified with Resveritrol and CoQ10, I happened onto this Church's & figured it wouldn't hurt anything to stick my head in the door for a second just for a little sniff of their delicious chicken frying...  Uh oh!     :-O  Ok, so I accidentally ended up with their 2-Piece (Spicy) Combo, which comes with a big chicken leg and thigh, plus mashed potatoes & gravy along with a drop biscuit & spread.  Of course every bite of this lunch was terrific!  With Ikea being the top value in the Valley for Breakfast (free to 99¢ including coffee!), this just has to be the top Lunch value around at $1.99 with the coupon that comes in the weekly shopper paper!  So it wasn't my fault, ok¿.     :-))
1 they gave me cold mac and cheese.
4 I always get coupons from them and it always bring me back to buy their chicken and the price are also good too. But they don't have a drive-thru like the one on baseline and I'm just being lazy..
