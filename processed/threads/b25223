5 Great place!  Friendly staff and the doctor is patient and very knowledgable
5 I found this practice based on my insurance and proximity to where I live. The location is right off of the 101 and 51-- super convenient and easy to find. I was seen as a new patient and got an appointment for about a week out.   Dr. Siegel was so friendly and personable, and was the first doctor I've ever had who took the time to explain all the equipment and processes to me. The appointment was so quick and painless!  I highly recommend this place.
1 I called and spoke to the receptionist at North Phoenix Eye Care. She had a bad attitude, and seemed confused on which Insurance companies they accepted. Her bad attitude alone, was enough for me to continue my search for an eye Doctor.
