3 Fast service, okay food. I've tried this location multiple times, but food quality ranges from bad to okay. My beloved tatter tots are never cooked to perfection, they just can't seem to find a happy medium here- they're either under or overcooked. On the plus side, their ice cream sundae is yummy, but melts fast on the way home unless you eat it and drive!
1 Not very nice. Demanded  I turn off my car. Never had that happen before. Very hot day.
1 I've literally been here 3 times in a row and been to about 4-5 of their drive-in spots didn't work. Pressed the red button 3 times in each space and nobody answered. I understand if they don't work but if they don't put an out of order sticker on them. This place sucks. A lot. But hey, it's sonic. Not setting the bar too high.
1 Over the past year out of approximately 50 visits to this location they got my order right and I got everything I ordered 2x. I have given up on this Sonic, the quality of the food is the worst of any sonic ever. Borderline disgusting. I don't know what the owner of this franchise is doing, but I guarantee he isn't eating there. The place is in dis-repair, don't even try the drive in spots, they are all usually broken.
1 They must only hire inept people here that don't have any common sense. Ordered a popcorn chicken combo & ended up giving me snack sized. Ordered one of those hot dogs that they advertise on the menu and got a chili cheese dog. Only good thing is I got a large diet coke without ordering one. Not sure what the issue is, but I most definitely will NOT be coming back here. Absolutely ridiculous!
