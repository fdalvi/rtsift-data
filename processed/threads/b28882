4 First impressions can be deceptive and on first impressions this just appears to look like any usual charity shop with your usual distribution of clothes, book and bric-a-brac, but the stuff on offer here is usually a cut above the rest and of higher quality than you might expect.  You rarely see any low end items in here and despite being relatively small, this place is usually worth a look in on your way past, because they limit themselves to only putting out the better donations and passing the other ones down the chain.  Although most of the sections are roughly equal in quality and importance my personal favourite is the books section which should cater for all interests.  Indeed I have managed to pick up in the past Gazza for £1 and Bleak House for £1.50 and not only you can you not argue with that value, but those are hardly books of the same genre.
