4 very unique shopping experience.  Every item is either cool, hip, unique, flashy, themed, glittered, spiked, bedazzled, sequined, or just downright random. if you love unique and individual fashion...this is the place.  one drawback...very crowded clothing displays make it a bit tricky to browse.  shop is very small and cute, owner is super friendly, but i wish she had more space to display her treasures.  if you love the hunt for the one of a kind....this is for you!
5 First review of 2013.  Before going out to dinner one night, my wife was browsing in this store and I met her there.  Pretty amazing place.  Beyond me, there was not a trace of Y chromosome in the entire shop.  Amidst a few small rooms, you will find clothing, accessories, handmade knick-knacks, accessories, shoes, accessories, make-up, accessories, accessories, and accessories.  And did I mention accessories?  Lots of unique, fashion stuff here and a lot of stuff you never expected--even stuff you didn't know existed.  You might be tempted to bring your tween or teenage daughter here, but there is a distinctly ADULT room here too, so parental guidance is suggested.  One more plus is that the owner sells things on consignment, so if you make unique bling or interesting, wearable, girly. . .stuff. . . that nobody else makes, take it to her instead of selling it on Etsy.  If she likes it, you may have just found a place to sell it.  You've been to the corporate mall stores--now try Trampalina.  If you're looking for that one thing that will complete your look and you haven't found it yet, you may just find it here.
