4 This location near the San Tan mall large selection of products.  The location was convenient to the Loop 202 as well as the mall. I stopped in on Monday late morning to pick up a few items. I met the new store manager, Liz. She was very nice, helpful and knowledgeable. She is working on a Doctorate and has a Masters in nutrition. She listened to what I was interested in and recommended similar products. One of the products I mentioned she warned me of the dangers and told me that there are other, safer options. I didn't feel like she was trying to up sell me on anything.  I would go back to this location again.
5 This a very nice Hi-Health, very large and spacious.  Well-organized.  The people at the counter are always helpful.  Good prices as well, way better then GNC.
5 When I went to this store I did not expect the level of knowledge that the sales associate Dylan provided.  Even though he was young it was obvious by his physique he knew what he was talking about.  I did not feel like I was being over sold on any items which is refreshing for a nutritional supplement store. I have my degree in Nutrition and agreed with all of his recommendations. The service was excellent as well as the product knowledge and the store has a wide variety of inventory.
4 I recently visited this HI Health store as I was looking for meal replacement shakes and some vitamins. The gal that was working seemed to be knowledgeable and was very nice.
3 I purchase all of my protein shakes and bars here as well as some other supplements. The staff is great,super friendly, but the store can not stay stocked up on a few items that I purchase weekly.
