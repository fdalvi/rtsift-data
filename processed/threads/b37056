4 Haven't had to go to a laundromat in years. Found this one via yelp today. They use a prepaid card instead of coins. Nice attendant to help with questions and keep everything clean. Glad to have found it.
3 Clean (2 stars) in an area of town where that's tough to find, but they use a card system. The card costs $3(!!) and the machine for cards doesn't accept quarters.  The customer service was good, until I asked if the machine takes quarters and the lady responded, you don't have cash? No, I have quarters. Geez.  Last straw? 1/3 of the machines were out if order. A sign nearby said, apologetically, "New machines coming in November." I won't come back to find out.
