5 my wife and I had our first experience with this dentist yesterday. Everyone was extremely friendly and efficient. The place was very modern , clean, and both of our appointments were kept on time if not a bit early. When I was there I observed an elderly man being treated with extreme patience and care. These people are great and we will be going back.
1 After moving 40 minutes away from the dentist I have seen for years I decided to try one closer to home.  I had my teeth cleaned and then the dentist came to speak with me about my issues.  I knew I had one tooth that needed a crown and another that needed a silver filling replaced but that has been on my treatment plan for a couple of years.  The Carefree Smiles dentist said I had decay under my recently crowned tooth - that tooth has been through a lot ( two root canals and two crowns) and another upper tooth that was cracking.   I immediately made an appointment the next day with my previous dentist, Great Smiles in Surprise AZ,  to find out why this newly crowned tooth (less than eight months old) had decay under it.  Dr. Eric Wendelschafer, who is fantastic, took a free x-ray showing me that there was nothing wrong with the crowned tooth and the second tooth that supposedly needed a crown was discolored to look like a cracked tooth around the filling but it is still in great condition with no need to crown it.  He even went as far to say if anything happens with the tooth with the crown up to even needing an implant that he would cover it - he is that confident there is nothing wrong with that crown.  I have decided to drive the 40 minutes to Great Smiles after this as I was not impressed with Carefree Smiles.
