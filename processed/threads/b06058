3 Some of the employees here make excellent sandwiches and are exceptionally polite, the others...not so much. It's pretty hit or miss depending on who's working when you go.   I like Port of Subs, so I'm happy to have a location near my neighborhood, however I wish the service were more consistent. Both my boyfriend and I have been skimped on veggies so many times, and it's really a frustrating issue when it happens on so many occasions. For me, a sandwich is more about the layers of vegetables and the delicious seasonings with a highlight of cheese, not the other way around, so when I'm offered a few measly slices of tomato it's a little insulting.   I'm not a high-frequency customer because there's also banh mi and salads up the street, so I only find myself motivated to eat here once in awhile given the competition.
1 Food poisoning! Yikes! AVOID
4 Wow, I'm surprised to see the negatives. We have had a good experience here.  Right now I am eating a veggie with so much lettuce I have a little salad on the side. cheeses and avocado are standard  We use all their services; delivery, internet pick-up and stop-in.  Fast delivery, GREAT pick-up, good stop-in. We always order online. The website is easy to use and gives all the options at the store with easy to select choices.  We do always go at night   I also like the macaroni salad and I love the pickles. I wish I knew what kind of pickles or a similar pickle. I love them.
1 This location stinks. Service is ridiculous. Girl behind the counter kept asking about the tattoos my husband and I have. Rather unprofessional and pretty rude. I'm not a fan of people who try to make small talk with me in the hopes that we have something in common. This location was also dirty. Never again. I will stick with Subway.
5 This place is really good, I eat here once or twice a week because I work in the area. Its affordable and great fresh food. Its very clean, they mop like 3 times a day and the employees are the nicest of any place I've ever been. Ask for the "UPS special", its a breakfast wrap with egg, turkey sausage and sliced chicken with barbeque sauce and provalone. Its the best wrap you'll ever eat.
5 I love port of subs! I stop in so much the employees know exactly what I want. The workers are always friendly, I've never had a bad experience. I usually get a specialized hot chicken in a cup with mayo/mustard, black olives, pepperonis and pepper jack cheese. They have their own mayo/mustard mix which is awesome so you don't have too much mustard and end up ruining it. They may not have as many selections of veggies as their competitors but at least their meat isn't made out of cardboard like some giant chain sub shops (cough*subway*cough). If you're in the mood for a high quality sandwich, wrap, or even my special cup and you're around the area defiantly give Port of Subs a try.
