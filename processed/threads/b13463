5 Dr. Kim is an amazing dentist. He's thoughtful, caring, and highly professional. When I used to live in Phoenix, I received regular dental checkups, as well as orthodontics work (Invisilign) and my teeth came out perfect!   He makes you feel right at home, and it's always a painless experience.
5 Dr. Kim took care of my  teeth for years. I am very satisfied with his perfect service and friendliness. He is very skillful in his job.
5 Dr Kim is AWESOME!!! By far the best dentist ever! He is so nice and naturally a genuine person! It's not the nicest location but inside it's super nice and always clean and tidy. Know that you won't get ripped off here, he works with integrity. Been coming here for 5+ years now!
