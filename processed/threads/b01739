3 Best fries anyone will ever eat in the history or future of ever. They are deep fried, crispy as a mother, and seasoned with awesomeness. End here, do not order further except for maybe a soft drink or something. Their burgers are baaaaaaad, not like throw it up and go to the hospital bad, but like why did I spend my hard earned money on this shit when mcdonalds is across the street? If Mcdonalds is the bottom of the barrel in burgers, then Rally's is like the sludge that settles and solidifies below that.   Their milkshakes are okie dokie I guess.  FRIES FRIES FRIES!
4 I disagree with  Fred M., I think the burgers are very good and wonder why people go into the Mc D's instead?!  They have a greater variety of burgers, chicken sandwiches, wings, fries, chili fries, milkshakes etc. And you get better tasting food and more of it for your money and they have a value menu and 2 for $3 and 2 for $4 deals that will fill you up.  I'd eat Rally's food any day over Mc Donald's, Burger King, In n Out Burgers or Arby's if there were only more Rally's Hamburger places around.  The only draw back is there is only outside seating and drive through service, but with good November weather like I had when I went sitting outside under an umbrella table was just fine.
4 I could have sworn I had Rally's before in my lifetime, but after I tried those fries, there is no way that I had it before because I definitely would have remembered it! The fries are THE BEST! The burger wasn't anything special, definitely can settle for burger king since it isn't much of a difference. They really do have a lot to choose from, but I doubt if I'll try, I gag at the thought of a chili cheese burger..*eek*   Furthermore, I will be back for more fries!
4 This location is just as good as the Tempe one. I use to go out of my way before I moved tp Tempe to eat here.  It's that good!
