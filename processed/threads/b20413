4 The Deli is welcoming and friendly cafe situated on Morningside Road.  Its name is slightly misleading as it is not necessarily a delicatessen.  It probably does most its trade through selling filled rolls, sandwiches and hot drinks.  The interior decor is clean and the bright colours on the wall create a bright atmosphere.   At the front counter the service is efficient and they have an impressive range of ingredients for sandwich fillings as well as a variety of different breads and baguettes.  I had cajun chicken and salad in a nice crispy baguette with a packet of cheese and onion crisps.  It tasted great but it was also quite pricey as it came to about Â£3.50 for what was essentially just a sandwich and a bag of crisps.   I can't dispute the quality of this place, however, and The Deli offers fresh ingredients, an extensive range of food and drink and great service to match.
5 Their toasted wraps are phenomenal! Highly recommend
5 Been going here for years.  The two Turkish guys that run it are brilliant.  I probably only manage in about once a fortnight, but I only have to walk in the door and they're already putting the mocha on heat for me.  I think they know all their regulars by name and preference, and there are plenty of them too.  You don't need to be a well known face to be made welcome though.  Lunchtime soup is to be savoured (it's almost always tomato and basil by the way).  Be sure to ask for bread to accompany.
