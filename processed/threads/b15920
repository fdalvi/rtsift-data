5 Great place for suits and a great price.
4 Henderson location.  Not as many suits to choose from.
3 This is a middle of the road kinda place. I'm sure there are better places out there but, there are also far worse. I felt satisfied buying from them.   I got a decent vest from them and a decent blazer. It works for me and my budget.
