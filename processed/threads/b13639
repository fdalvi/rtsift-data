4 I peed here many times. And I've eaten here - well not here - I ordered at the drive through and ate in my car on the way to/from Cali but same thing, right?  Anyway, its a clean anf fast McDonalds. What else can you ask for? Good job.
4 Most of you know what to expect at a McDonalds, so I will keep this one very short:  fast service, hot food, and fairly clean.  It makes for a decent pit-stop in Gila Bend.
1 The first Drive up window is covered with a sunblock screen, I drove by it only to hear knocking from the back of my truck. So I pulled back to pay. Then they forgot straws. Then had to pull back because they gave my 2 year old frys instead of apples. Gila bend is punishment from above!
3 Considering this Mickey D's is one of very few choices to stop for food and restrooms on the way to/from Rocky Point, we ended up stopping here twice over the long weekend.  I'm not a fast food fan, and I'm especially not a huge fan of McDonald's but I do have to say that they make a mean ice cream cone!  I had a coffee on our first stop, which was just fine (although they didn't have my preferred sweetener - the pink one).  On the way back, I went with a classic crispy chicken sandwich and had a few of Jared's fries; both were pretty gross.  For 55 cents though, I had a bag of apple slices, which was a not only a great deal but a healthy option too.    Decent bathrooms and a changing station to boot, I was thankful for that (as was baby M).  This is definitely not a destination but a decent road trip stop.  Be prepared though, it gets very busy on holiday weekends!
4 For a "toxic" meal this location is pretty clean.
3 Great McDonald's.  We stop here every time we drive from San Diego to Phoenix.  Always clean and consistently good.  Nice and new too.  Only 3 stars, though, because it is after all a McDonald's.
3 good fast service, and the food didn't disappointed. i must have come in at the end of a rush because it was a little nasty in there.
1 Absolutely the worst McDonald's anywhere!   Bathroom's trash was overflowing and had no toilet paper.  Most pathetic looking employees ever - everyone looked miserable.   Manager was a total beeoch  when I told her she was giving us the wrong food and stormed off.  Rather than emptying the trash bins a worker used some metal device to smash it down.  Gross!  Food took at least 5 minutes to come out and was mediocre.   Go somewhere else!!
1 Stopped here to pee and eat breakfast our way to Rocky Point from Phoenix. Being a popular stopping point for those going to Mexico and San Diego you would think they would be suited to handle a plentiful amount of customers.....Nope. Walked in to see the counter lined with at least twenty tickets that hadn't been made and the kitchen staff seemed to move at a glacial pace. We were able to order right away but got stuck waiting 10 minutes before they called our number only to tell us they were out of sausage. Did I mention it was only 7:30? They still had three hours to go! After yet another 10 minutes they finally were substituted two sad looking bacon strips on a biscuit and called my number. It was the driest thing I have ever eaten. Not that I'm expecting much from McDonalds but c'mon!
