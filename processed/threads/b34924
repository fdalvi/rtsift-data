4 Apparently I love to get my hair cut while out of town. And coming from a guy who BARELY gets his hair cut (and truthfully, BARELY has any hair to cut) that means that most of the haircuts of the last 5 years of my life have happened at random out of town spots.  Well, folks, add Mesa to the mix. That's where I got my hair cut today, and that's the latest locale where I lopped my locks.   Men and women of Mesa, take note: you can get your hair cut here, too. You don't have to a be an out of town vagabond. They're here every day chopping away, and you can walk in for a trim. Actually, as I discovered today, they're really pushing this whole "check in online" thing and have a specific app you can also download. I haven't looked at it, but if it sets a reminder for your haircut then I'm totally into it. I only seem to remember at the most inopportune and rushed times (ie. "Oh crud, I'm going to be on TV tomorrow morning and I look like Ringo.")  As for the cutters--they weren't the most personable peeps on the block, but when it came down to it they all seemed to know what they were doing. My cutress was a nice enough lady and cut pretty quickly. I didn't get the courtesy ear trim (sexy, I know) but I also didn't ask for it. I did, however, get the courtesy eyebrow trim. So that was a bonus I only seem to get at 1 out of 10 haircutteries.
5 I get my haircut every two weeks...they make me feel like its a small town barbershop..quick and great service..always have some sort of a promotion going on..would recomend
2 I came here because Cost Cutters was closed and I left a bit disappointed.   My cut was fine,  I just went in for a trim but since I was going out after I asked the stylist if she could just blow dry my hair. (Not style, blow dry)  She blow dried it, barely put a spritz of hairspray in and we were done. A haircut costs $12...needless to say, I was a bit shocked when I was charged $31.00. I looked at the board and noticed for a "regular style" was $18.  1. I  don't understand how a style costs more than a cut, 2. I was shocked I was charged their full price of a style when all I asked for (and got done) was a simple blow dry.  When I asked for a blow dry, she should have made it known it would cost me an additional $18.  I was pretty upset when I walked out and because of that, I won't be back.  I have NEVER paid near that for a blow dry.  $5, maybe. $18?! I don't think so!
5 Always have a good experience every time I get my hair cut here. They also send out coupons, making their service even more affordable. I love the online checkin option, allows me to know when to show up- I don't think I have ever waited more than 2 mins. I definitely recommend them !
