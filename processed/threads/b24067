4 Their cinnamon rolls are really good, prices seem really low for high quality looking pastries. decor is a bit rustic, country style. There's an online coupon to buy one get one free pastry, check online frequently.   Sun Prairie needs a fresh Amish bakery, and I doth approve.
4 I just found out that they expanded their lunch menu and it's quite tasty.  They make everything fresh and the bakery goods are quite tasty.  I would come here before any other sandwich shop.  They also sell baking ingredients and even craft goods.  A definite stop when going through town.
3 I've driven by this place many times, and I've seen their table at the Saturday morning Farmer's Market (May - October), and I was curious.   It isn't very big, and they don't offer a ton of stuff, but I liked what I saw. There were baked goods like sugar cookes, lemon bars, brownies, loaves of bread, etc. (I got six regular to large sized sugar cookies for $3.25, which I thought was great.) There are some baking items, like rice flour and spices, but I had the munchies and didn't pay much attention to those. I also bought a tub of "Organic Pitted Dates Pakistani Pitted Dates", $3.05/pound.   There were non-food items, too. Lots of carved wood plaques with Bible verses. Not my style, but they looked well made (I didn't check the price). There were some cute birdhouses (or maybe bird feeders? pretty sure they were houses) in the entryway that were very attractive, but again I didn't check the price.   It looks like a family operation. There was a middle-school-aged boy behind the counter who was very polite. Another boy, a little older, maybe his brother, came out of the kitchen area for a minute before returning to the back.  There are a couple of tables in the front of the store, I guess for enjoying your thick, gooey brownies.
