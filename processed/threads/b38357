1 Now that it has changed hands it's no fun.
4 Excellent ambience! It was clean and quiet. I'm sure this place has a bad rep from the last place that was there...Kahootz? I almost did not go in because of the old bar. I am glad I did, the bartender was friendly. The food was decently priced, nothing much different about the food from any other bar. Would have gotten a 5 if the food was better or different atleast. I would definitely be back.
1 I stopped in on my way home from work not only did they not have my Johnnie  walker scotch but the stake sandwich I ate made me sick for two days! Needless to say I'll never go back and if you know what's good for you should ad void going here at all costs!
5 I would have never ventured in here when it was Kahootz, but they have fixed the place up and have some great bartenders, I always win when I play here, and the service is great.
