2 I really want to love this place but on two different occasions during a month period they have been out of fish or burgers. The ordering process is chaotic and the placement of the menu is awkward. Some printed menus would be nice so I can wait behind people and actually look at a menu. Inside it looks abandoned. No decor or anything just plain. It would be nice to see who Grandma Ruth is, since it is in honor of her. Throw some pictures on the wall or something. The pinball machines are so annoying and loud. Gave it 2 stars because the onion rings and pickles are really good.
3 The service was great. The food is mediocre. It's the same as Pete's. Good alternative to the same ol' stuff. However, Louie's up the road has real hand battered cod whereas this was a square piece of processed fish. Nothing to be excited about...
5 This place is awesome. The service is great and the food is similar to Pete's Fish and Chips, but the red sauce is spicier (hence better). I grew up on fish like this, so this is like a bite of childhood. Awesome.
