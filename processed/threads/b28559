5 Call 2 weeks in advance (at least)! Great staff, fun environment, inviting atmosphere, and most important- GREAT hair afterwards!!!
5 I have been getting my hair cut & colored by Mia for years.  She is the most cheerful down to earth person you'll ever meet.  I am picky when it comes new color or cuts, but the next day after seeing her I am always ecstatic how awesome my hair looks and feels after trying something new.
