1 Went through the drive through. The window person was nice but the food was very not nice to my boyfriends stomach this evening. Food born illnesses can be deadly (clearly not what my boyfriend has-but still)  We will not be venturing here again  Makes me wonder what we are doing to our bodies with this crap cheap food. It ends up being more expensive that the dollars and cents we hand over at the drive through window....

4 I love Carl's Jr and I can't wait until this one reopens!
2 I always try the current 6 Dollar burger special they have.  The food is always just so so. It always seems a little cold like they let things sit around too long before slapped together and tossed in a sack. They are always friendly and the interior is clean, but the food quality is sub-par at best.
2 This place is okay. Service is slow. Everyone seems to be doing something but nothing at the same time.   Food is okay. I have yet to find anything here that I really like enough to come back for.
3 Made a quick stop here to quickly fill up because our stomachs were running on empty that afternoon. I stuck with the dollar menu for my sandwich (spicy chicken sandwich) and ordered a side of onion rings. The chicken sandwich was filling for the dollar I paid. It was also freshly cooked which I appreciate. The onions rings were also fresh but they were the blandest onion rings I have ever tried. Service was also prompt which is a hit or miss in fast food. Will I return? If I am in the area again and need a quick bite then yes. I will just stick with the chicken sandwich next time though.
