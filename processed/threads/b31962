5 Great place! We've tried other places and my son loves this place the best. They also serve dinner for them from local restaurants for an added fee of course.
4 we liked it the one time we used them but their Facebook page says they were closing end of Sep 2012. Anyone know if that is true?
5 My kids loved this place.  Unfortunately it had to close due to personal issues of the owner.  Please, someone, open this place back up!
