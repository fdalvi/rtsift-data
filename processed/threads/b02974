2 This Panda Express location is a difficult one to review.  As is typical of the Panda, the food's good and cooked up fast. No, it's not gourmet Chinese, but it's tasty enough.  But then we come to the weakness of this location: The menu.  The selection is really, really slim. To the point they don't even have sweet and sour chicken, for crying out loud. I'm used to Panda Express locations varying in their options (Potato Chicken and String-Bean Chicken are always hard to come by), but this one really takes the cake as far as limited selection goes.
4 1st time Panda Express experience...I thought the food was good.  Simple, good, inexpensive...the food was far better than I anticipated for a chain.  I'll go back.  My sons love going there - I can see why.  BBQ pork, chow mein, Chicken w/ string beans - all very tasty.
