5 Casey and his team were great to work with from start to finish!  Loved seeing the computerized color choices.  The crew was professional, polite, timely and best of all spoke fluent English!  I would highly recommend them!
5 I had Casey and his team paint my home both inside and out...they are the best in the business. I sell new homes and am around other painting companies and know what the other guys deliver and Daisy Mountain is #1 when it comes to quality, care and expertise. I will never use another painting company......if you want the best, go no further.  I also loved the computerized software they have to show how your house looks in various HOA approved color schemes....now who can offer that!   His paint staff was professional, did quality work, especially when you have 2 tones throughout the home and was very clean.   Daisy Mountain Painting.....my painter for life!

5 I called five contractors to paint our house.  Two didn't respond.  Of the three that did, Casey was easily the most professional and provided the most detailed information.  The price was also very competitive.  Great job, great clean-up.  Our house looks so much better as we had the outside walls painted as well. Everything was as promised.
