2 This shop is a browsing only experience.  Go inside, have a look around.  Check out that new TV you've been after. Ask the man alot of questions about it. Pretend you know what he's talking about it. Consider the cheaper model. Decide that you only live once and go for it!  Walk out of the shop. Amazon.com for Â£300 cheaper.
3 Shops punting high-end electronic goods are the male equivalent of a fancy boutique with expensive handbags and shoes in the window. Anyone with a set of testicles will find it quite difficult to not get captivated by the enormous TVs on sale in here, but the astronomical cost will almost certainly have them heading to the Internet or the back of a lorry afterwards.  Having just had to replace, at great cost, a PlayStation 3 for the second time in two years I'm no longer quite as convinced about the quality.
3 If you like big flashy toys and accessories to jazz up your home or car then this is the place for you. The staff are friendly and quite enthusiastic although you can see a small glimmer in their eyes die when you say you are just browsing. They like talking about their toys though. Worth a browse just to see what the market is at or what TV/ sound system models are available before deciding on taking the magic plastic card out.
2 I honestly think its time for places like this to stop selling and become modern day museums to the newest technologies.  My reasoning? Well, you can come in here and ask all the questions you like, play with the products, be given the sales jargon and drool over all the technology you want - but truthfully, you know deep down in your soul you are going to go onto Amazon and buy it for half the price you saw it in here.  I think its quite a shame, but really, this place is just for window shopping only. Amazing stuff in it, yes, but its just not worth it.
2 Ok, so it's a Sony shop. But I'm sorry to have to say that it's lost in the modern day world of technology.....we are ruled by Apple now, lets not lie!! So Sony is sort of left outside. It's a shame, because back in the day it was a pretty good electronics shop.  The prices are high though, and it's so easy nowadays to get the same product for half the price. Meh.
