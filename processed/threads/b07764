4 Found these guys on Backpage.com selling 25 round magazines for a Ruger 10-22.  The price was double but that is because of Congress trying to implement the 94 weapons ban that limits magazines to 10 rounds.  They also sell guns but you need to call them to see what is in stock.  What this place is known for is selling sports cards and they do not have guns on display but give them a call.
5 Today i purchased a pistol from here. The guy was helpful,friendly and overall great place and had the best price in town(s) for the Kel Tec i purchased.
5 I purchased a firearm from this store. Great prices and friendly service. I will be a repeat customer. I like supporting small business like this. They are the backbone of  America.
5 Joe is a good guy in the firearm's section. There's always some nice toys in stock. Sometimes you might even be like "oh" or "awh...," "very nice". If Joe does not have what you are looking for, just talk to him and see if he can order it up for you. Joe is a decent guy and is more than fair on the prices. This is a great example of an American mom and pop business trying to make it in a sea full of sharks and piranha. I might have to wait on a few speciality toys which is to be expected given the political climate now, but his quality, success, and friendship will come first before I go to a big corporate store.
