4 Good open stick/puck games during the week. I also play men's league here. Only down side is the ice sucks occasionally.
5 We are visiting from out of state and my son did the Skate and Surf camp and he loved it so much I had to take him the next day. The coach was excellent and it was a great program.
4 Oceanside is a great rink. They have programs for kids and adults, with experienced coaches who genuinely love what the do. The pro shop is run by Jarred, and all the guys that work there have been playing hockey their whole lives and really know what they're doing in there. The men's league program is great for guys (and gals) who never want to give it up, and the games are fun to watch. It's not the biggest or fanciest rink in the state, but I think it adds to the family feel of the facility.  Whether you're a seasoned vet or want to get the kids (or yourself!) started in the great sport of hockey, this is your place!
4 Could use a few more seating areas, but a great place to watch youth hockey or catch the occasional ASU game.
4 If a dive bar and an ice rink had a baby it would be Oceanside. The people are friendly the ice is good. I can't speak for the mite leagues or club hockey but the Adult D league is well organized and compared to other leagues a good value.
