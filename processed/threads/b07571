4 I've been here several times for meetings.  It's a cool concept because you can book as much or as little space as you need but still have access to all of the facility's amenities.  The meals and snacks are pretty good.  Sometimes if they are full the parking can be a little tough.
4 An older version of Desert Willow, this one still has all the amenities and treats people well.  The staff is just as attentive and the food is always flowing.  Gotta love that when you are to do business all day long!  The bathrooms aren't exaclty my favorite as many of the doors' locks don't work anymore and they are a bit run down.  But a lot of this comes with being an older conference center.  As long as they keep providing the treats and great service...I don't mind it so much.
