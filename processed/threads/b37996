5 Celestia has amazing talent and is wonderful to work with. I have used Two Heads several times and always send my friends to them.  Whether it is a wedding, birthday or corporate event, everyone loves to have their caricature done.
5 I've hired Two Head Studios over a dozen times now and continue to be impressed.  They spread the gamut in terms of creativity.  I've had them do caricatures, drawings for shirts/mugs, my wedding cake topper!, drawings at my son's birthday party, puzzle map creations, Christmas cards, and they are the staple going away gift for individuals leaving my organization (beats a plaque hands down).  Always on budget and has NEVER missed a deadline.  But the most impressive part is their ingenuity and ability to create the most amazing products.  I've given specific detail on what I want and have also just provided a picture and said "Make this awesome!"  I have never been disappointed.  In fact, highly recommend the "Make this awesome" approach, their ideas are always much better than what I can come up with on my own.       I will, hands down, be a loyal and returning customer for as long as they are in business.  Exceptional.... absolutely exceptional.
