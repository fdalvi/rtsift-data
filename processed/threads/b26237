4 Nice branch. The inside is clean and the tellers very friendly. I like all options for shopping and eating around it too. The parking isn't as tight at this location as it can be at others.   They have drive up banking and a ATM.
1 They will promise you the world to get you to open accounts but will not follow through.  They will thank you for being a preferred customer but laugh when you have a problem and won't do anything to correct their mistakes (closed an account without my permission or consent and without notifying me).  They also only have one ATM at this location, so if it out of service, be prepared to wait in line for a teller or drive to a different branch.
1 Its a bank,  they take your money, invest with it, make money off of it, they take a bail out, and still charge you a monthly fee.
4 Came up here to set up a new account.  And was immediately greeted by Carlos who helped me out and got me set up extremely quick.  Clean good coffee and friendly service I'll be back.  The whole thing took about a half hour
3 Ok this bank is full of nice people who share the secrets of saving & investments. I give it 3 stars total. They are sweet people but I love this bank 4th. Three other banks come before it in my book. It's true everyone can't have first place but I think this bank don't try to come in first. Customer service could be over all better.
