2 So it's just a McDonald's.  So what?  Well, unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) the are not all created equal.  I have been to this location several times.  The staff is friendly for a McDonald's, but I would say it takes roughly twice as long to get my food as it does at other locations.  I don't think I have ever received my food where there wasn't at least something left off of my tray, like a drink, or french fries.  There are so many McDonald's to choose from surrounding this one, I might keep on driving an extra mile or so and visit another location.
2 Fast drive-thru, slow service inside.  Hardly any counterspace inside, as though they really just have this place for the drive thru customers.  Food same as any other McDonalds.
1 Let's face it, McDonald's isn't exactly gourmet fast food, but at least it's fast, right? Wrong! This location blows. The drive thru is unbelievably slow. Worse, I'm not sure what I just ate; the first bite of that Egg McMuffin tasted like dish soap, and it was cold! I might also make one suggestion. It might behoove the owner/operator to have a person who speaks English working the drive thru.
1 This is the worst Mcdonalds ever the manger looks like a fucking creep and there service is slow... They forgot my ranch and made my plain Mcdouble with extra ketchup.
1 Well after a long 14 HR. Day at work I wanted to grab something fast and easy...  well not fast at all in fact a little over 10 min just to get too the food.  I can handle that. But when I went home too eat my food there was hair.  I called the manager to confront her about it...  the answer I got was I don't know how that happened. We don't have anyone with long hair working the grill. I was offered to have the food remade but between the wait,  hair,  and being questioned. I don't want it remade...  I feel bad giving this place one star
