1 The food and service were both subpar. They were out of french fries, there was hair in the food, and to top it off the mac' n' cheese noodles were soggy.The food is made "as you order" which meant it took 20 minutes to get it. Overall not somewhere I would ever eat again!
4 This review is based on the JD's food cart that is usually parked on State Street and Gilman Street.  Man! This food cart is amazing. Polish sausages, fried chicken sandwiches, and fried fish sandwiches. I can never get enough of their fried fish sandwich, topped with Frank's hot sauce and a slab of mayo. It's the best late night food, whether you're on a late night walk, need something in your stomach after alcoholic intake, or just passing buy and wanting a late dinner.   The sad thing is I think their hours vary. But I've seen them open as early as 10 PM and close as late as 2 AM. Sometimes the hours aren't consistent though and they might not show up on occasion during Mondays through Wednesdays.
3 Looking around town for Jin's chicken and fish which wasn't in its normal Francis location we found this spot. Fulfilling after bar chicken/fish sandwiches. Would never go here for a meal but it's a perfect after bar spot. I got a chicken sandwich which was basically two chicken fingers drenched in Franks Red Hot, mayo, tiny lettuce piece on a thin hamburger bun. Did the trick for what I wanted.
