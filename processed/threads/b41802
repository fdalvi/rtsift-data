5 Great source for vaping, walked in based on a recommendation today, Taylor the owner was very helpful, i'm new to the vaping thing, and had many questions, he took his time & went over everything with me.  I got to try out many different flavors & devices till i found one that suited my needs & price range, Taylor didn't try to upsell me or pressure me into buying anything, he was informative & guided me towards the best product for me.  Overall all A+ experience here, i wont be using any other shops for my vaping needs, good luck with the business, from what i've seen, i'm very impressed. Thanks
5 This place is just TOP NOTCH!!!! I came in to the store and had NO clue about vaping and the owner, Taylor, helped me get started on my Ego C Twist kit and great juices that they have! I got Peppermint Bark flavor and Chocolate Chip Mint and they are amazing!!!! I will only go to Pro Source Vapes from now on! Check out the FB Page with all new stuff all the time!
5 I know absolutely nothing about E-cigs or Mods. I thought I hit the jack pot with an Ego-T I had. The owner Taylor took the time to show me and teach me the basics. He put together an awesome Mod for me and the Liquid they make in house is awesome! I definitely recommend this shop.
4 I stopped by just to check out the selection.  My wife, kids and I were visiting the Scottsdale area on vacation from California where vape shops are far more common.  The guy that helped me was very knowledgeable (he may have been the owner) and really knew his stuff.  Juice selection was decent, ample stock of both authentic and clone mods, and he was very open to letting me sample some stock that he just got in. He actually un-boxed it in front of me.   Bottom line, great shop and next time I'm in the area I know where to go if I need something!
