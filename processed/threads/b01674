5 Wow I'm super impressed with this laundromat.   Dollar wash  50 to 75Â¢ to dry  Staff is friendly, always smiling  Thank you to the man working 11/8/12 . Thank you for  to helping me get the laundry basketa in my bexhill.
2 Machines are very old - many out-of-order. Premises not very clean.  A tacky place.  Will not go there again.
4 Came here to use commercial washers for my comforters. Place is kept very clean and their staff is very helpful and helped me choose the right machines that I needed. The machines seem a little old but didn't have any problems with them. A+ staff!
