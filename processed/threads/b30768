5 I stopped in and Debbie cut my hair perfectly. I highly recommend her! I will be going back for sure.
1 BEWARE.  I went there for the first time last week largely because of the price stated on their website.  The website indicates a price of $15 for a man's cut.  This is about the price one pays at one of the chain shops so I decided to try this private salon thinking I might get a better cut and find a new place to go for a hair cut since it is also close to home.  I don't know the name of the lady who cut my hair but as she prepared to cut my hair she brought over a towel, sprayed down my hair, dropped the towel on the floor, and proceeded to wipe the excess water from my face with the towel she had just picked up from the floor.  Unbelievable.  When I was ready to leave she told me the price was $20.  I complained saying the price was $15 on their website, but she didn't change the price.  I paid the $20, gave her a tip, and will NEVER be back.
