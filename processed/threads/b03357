5 normal hair cuts are about $20.  they know what they are doing and use a hot lather at the end to shave your neck.  i've been going for about 10 years.   normal guys should feel right at home here! a true barber shop.  never a long wait for a walk in either.
5 WOW! These guys are a class act. Not only was I insanely impressed with my haircut, but I was beyond impressed with their customer service and attention to detail. If you're looking for a barber I highly recommend these guys.
4 A Real Barber Shop for Real Men.  I really enjoyed my first cut at Gio's. The place looks like an old time barber shop, no frills, not pretty, just a great place to get your hair cut.  I came here because my long time barber (Nodari) just moved here from one of those big pretty boy chains.  You get good conversation a good cut and a reasonable price here and they even have a hot towel for you if you want one.  I will be back soon.  Ask for Nodari and if it is your first visit, use the $5 off coupon I used.  I found the coupon on the web at www.GiosBarber.com    Hairs to you,  Cheers.
5 First time trying this place, but I will definitely be back.  Olesya does an excellent job and was good for conversation as well!
