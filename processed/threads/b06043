1 I was promised by the salesperson that I could exchange any defective tile that I purchased in the clearance section.  So I did, only to have the manager say that they wouldn't honor what the sales person said but that she could give me a discount on any other item I wanted to purchase.  I asked for a discount on another item, she said no.   Twice they went back on their word.  I won't shop there again.
4 Bedrosian is a fuuuuun place to visit and get ideas for your home decorating.  They have tile, back splashes, and granite!  Their show room is clean and has many samples of patterns you can make with their tiling and backsplashes.  Their granite warehouse is so much fun to walk around!  There are rows upon rows of huge granite slabs in all colors and designs.  We ended up buying some granite and tile from Bedrosian.  Great customer service both times.  When we bought our granite, the guy who helped us was named David Whetstone (what a perfect name for the business, huh?) and he was super helpful, and worked with us to get a granite that was in the right price range for us.  He even gave us some suggestions of contractors to call and get estimates from because we were kind of at a loss for that.
