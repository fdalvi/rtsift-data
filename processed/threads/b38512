5 Professinal Services
5 Vivian is very good, friendly and professional. Love going to this salon.
5 Great nail salon! Very friendly! They suggested upgrades but weren't pushy when I said I couldn't afford the pedicure this week; just encouraged me to come back next week. I got a gel manicure...they took their time and were very precise with their work. Moderate selection of gel colors, more than just pinks at other salons! Fair pricing + good work = 2nd visit! Will definitely go back to KV!
