3 I'm new to town and it was hard to find a post office.  somehow I came along this one...it's inside the asian supermarket.  There was just one person working there in a desk like environment.  Guess its contracted out?  But I was able to get my stamps and mail my mail out...    Now sure what other services they offer, but seemed like they could do most of the services.
1 Stay clear of all USPS. Use some other business whenever possible
3 Relatively quick when I stopped in a few days ago. The PO is hit or miss and it depends on who's behind the counter.
5 Quick, friendly and very helpful!  I needed to send postcards to my friends. And my postcards didn't suit to any envelope properly. So the guy over there helped me to put them into smaller envelope and glue it up with the tape. Then I messed up with address so he helped me to fix it on the same envelope. That envelope is total hardcore but I know my friends will have fun to receive it. Usually people not very helpful in post office but there I had really pleasant experience.  Thank you!
