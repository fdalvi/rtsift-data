1 Bad place to have your air conditioner looked at! Had to take it in two times and charged over 100 to fix it and they have no idea what they are doing!!!!! Do not go there for a fix they only want your money!!!! They are idiots and can not work on air conditioners!!! DO NOT GO HERE!!!
3 A but pricey but fast. They almost always try to sale me more than what I really need- wipers, air filter, balance and rotate tires...but that's their job, I guess if you go in with coupons and a tolerance for the sales pitch should be good to go!
5 They knew what kind of oil my new car required, were honest with me about additional services not really being needed, and even rotated my tired by hand because their pneumatic gun had been stolen. Very nice people, fast service, and good price. Did I mention they basically washed my car for me just to be nice? Highly recommended.
