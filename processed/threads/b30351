4 I recently discovered Erehwon. Better prices than REI. Nice friendly staff.   Merchandise could be organized better. I tried my darnedest to figure out which hats were intended for women or men or children and finally determined that you are on your own here. Even when I asked, they only gave me a brief, useless answer.   If I had a million dollars...
1 will never shop at this store again.  Wish I had not bought Christmas presents here.  Called to ask if they honor prices at other stores and told by employee that he was certain they honor other store prices.  When I went to the store the store manager refused to honor price.  Will order my item online.  No wonder Wisconsin stores are losing sales to online retailers.
4 I somehow managed to survive last winter with my North Face Apex jacket and a few sub-layers (Arc'Teryx hoodie, Saucony base)... however, the past few days have shown me how ill-prepared I really have been for this ruthless winter.  + Decent selection of products + Helpful staff - they were patient and knowledgeable + Great suggestions - Prices were largely "full MSRP", although some of the older items were discounted - Not everything is in stock  I ultimately chose a Mountain Hardware jacket (the second warmest in the store) and an awesome pair of Oregon Research mittens. I can't thank the staff enough for their patience, knowledge, and suggestions. I left the store happy and warm. That's a win in my book!
