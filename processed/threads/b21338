4 Cheryl is a smart lady, hooking you on her talented handiwork by offering free 15 minute chair massages at the Scottsdale Farmer's Market. I stopped by and she had a waiting list, but I signed up, shopped around and came back for my turn.   Right on with pressure, and she had some moves no one else has every done on me. She has an office as well as offering to come out to your home ($85 plus trip fee)  and here is the list of services she offers:  Myofacial Release Lymphatic Drainage Cellulite Reduction Pregnancy Massage East Indian Head Massage Traditional Thai Massage Rain Drop Therapy Swedish Massage  Her rates are 30 mins for $35; 1 hour for $65; 1.5 hours $90 as well as discounted packages and a Referral discount (hehemmm, refer to me!)  She also does take credit cards so that is helpful. I am heading over to her for a follow up visit on Dec 6 and will update again!
3 pretty good.  likely not worth full price but with a deal it's a good bet.
5 When I found Cheryl almost three years ago I was as close to immobility as you can get and still manage to function. I too met her at the Old Town Farmers Market and was taken with her touch and her sense of caring. In the time I have been with her, my activity ability has increased greatly! I can get up and down from the floor, I can kneel, my hands are fully flexible! I never thought I would feel this physically well again!  For a caring and "in touch" therapist I would and I have recommended Cheryl!
4 I have tried and spent a lot of time and money on injections, acupuncture, medication, physical therapy,  physician visits, and chiropractic treatment since 2008.   After my massage today, I was almost pain free! And, better yet, this was Chery's basic massage....can't wait to see what will happen when she zones in therapeutically. Her style is unique and self developed....she manages to achieve great results without painful deep pressure.  So glad I stopped by the Scottsdale Farmer's Market where Cheryl offers free chair massages.
