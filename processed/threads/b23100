5 Needed a pace to store our things for a year while we moved in with Mom. Units was the most affordable and practical option for us. After securing a Unit and scheduling a time, the truck showed up with a very large and very clean storage unit. Once we loaded up our things the truck came back, picked up the Unit and took it to an air conditioned warehouse. Throughout the year the family owned business took care of our little Unit and sent payment reminders via email. The customer service was great and come to find out, Units is a family owned business which is awesome because I'm all for supporting local businesses.  Friendly employees, clean units, quick service.  Long story short, Units was a fantastic option for storage and moving. Highly recommended!
5 Great customer service and much more affordable than PODS.  I really like that they are local and keep everything stored in an air conditioned area. This was my first time using a portable storage container and wouldn't have made my move any other way.
5 I used Units to store some of my furniture and household items during remodel last month.  Right from the beginning I knew they were good.  I own my own business and am stickler for customer service.  My timing changed a few times due to the contractor's schedule and Units adjusted without issue.  Delivery was completed when they said it would, my bill was as they said and they could not have been better.  If I have need for storage again, I will be calling Units!
