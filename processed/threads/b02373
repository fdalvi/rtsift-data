4 Went here today to have my tailpipe extended for emission testing. George was very courteous and the price he quoted me over the phone stuck when I visited his shop. It took all of 20 minutes! AND HE IS OPEN SATURDAYS! Will be going back for further modifications in the future.
5 What a great business. I've had mufflers added to my 1988 Mustang that sounded great. I had a stolen catalytic converter replaced on my 1999 Toyota 4 runner. both times he did excellent work for a really good price. I highly recommend Mad Hatter. He even said that I could bring in some rebar from home depot and he would weld it onto the new cat converter to prevent any future theives from stealing.
5 Been a few days since George and Furman finished installing my new exhaust system on my 88 Fiero.  I am very pleased with the result, and am very happy with their service. They are decently priced, and work quickly and effectively.If you need any exhaust work done, bring it here.
1 Wanted to get a Flowmaster muffler installed and this was the cheapest place I could find to do it. I also read the other reviews and figured it was a slam dunk. However, not so much. When I brought the truck in to get the muffler installed, they said that the muffler was too big and it wouldn't fit. I would have to get the right size in order for them to do the work. So I called Wade's Discount Muffler & Brakes, and Wade told me it wasn't a problem. Not only did Wade do the work, but he also only charged me $5 more. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THE WORK, THEN WHY EVEN BOTHER HAVING A BUSINESS!!
