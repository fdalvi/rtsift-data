5 $7 + tip... such a deal!  We realized that Jared needed his shoes shined today when we landed back in Phoenix and I had a feeling it would be cheaper and faster to get them done at the airport than at the hotel or anywhere else for that matter...  We were in terminal 4 and found Teri working for the Goodfellows location near the Starbucks - D gate.  She was super friendly and in approximately 10 minutes, she made Jared's shoes look as good as new!   This company is based in Vegas but recently opened locations here at the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport as well as multiple resorts in town.    They say the first thing people look at is your shoes, so Jared should be feeling dynamite tonight in his... and hopefully mine won't be too shabby either :)
4 Of course it depends on the person you get, but Goodfellows usually does a good job with a shoe shine when I have a few extra minutes in the PHX terminal.  They have locations both before and after security, which is good.  Prices are a pretty good value too.
5 Dedefo did a great job shining my old pair of shoes.  Stop by for a nice relaxing shoe shine and give those old pair of shoes new life.
5 I'm not often a shoe shine guy, but when I'm in the airport I find it's a great way to kill time and add a little extra hop to your step. Last time I was in PHX I had the chance to meet Winkie. She did a fantastic job on my boots and was fun to chat with too. Goodfellows is an airport chain of sorts, I've used them in San Francisco as well. The shine guy in the new terminal at SFO definitely doesn't have Winkie's personality, so that plus a great shine earns her five stars!
