5 Yay, this location is finally open! So glad to have one closer to where I live! Same great menu to choose from and friendly service.
5 The best teriyaki in town :) finally one that's in center Vegas :) highly recommended fast food
5 The best teriyaki chicken with brown rice, addicting. The sound system there sounds better than most too with 2 big HD tvs.
3 Food was enjoyable and there was plenty. I just hate when restaurants cheapen the quality of the meat. The steak used to be actual steak but is now a cheap philly steak type of thing and charging for the sauce that used to be put on the food is a bit much as well.
2 Service at this location during lunch hour is really slow....not good for the working individual that has only an hour for lunch!  But food is still good
