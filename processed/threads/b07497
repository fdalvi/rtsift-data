1 All I can say is that they quoted us a price of $765.00 for the replacement of two battery cables and a new battery. You take it from there. Wish they had a rating of  minus cause thats where I would put them.
5 I wont go anywhere else to get my car fixed. Ask for John when you go here. He was very courteous and friendly from the get go. He went out of his way to let me know in detail what he was going to do and how he was going to do it. He probably didn't need to since i'm not too smart in the car area.
5 They do great work, and their customer service was excellent.  I saved a lot of money and the I was very happy with the way that John and Rob communicated with me throughout the whole job.  Family owned and operated for 2 generations already, give them a try before you waste your money at the dealership... you wont regret it!
5 i have been a customer at tony's auto for many  years,i've always got a great service and so many times the owner John went out of his way to help me ,i never felt taken advantage of or pushed to get service that i didnt need.I personally will not go anywhere else,the staff is corteus,the service prompt and everybody is always smiling,thank you John with me you have a happy customer for life
5 I went to the Honda stealership then came here. Car was fixed on time and I saved 40% !!! Thanks John and Rob, the wife will be happy with the car now. Runs like new again. Don't be deceived with the area, the shop does quality work."
5 I happened upon Tony's Auto Repair when I broke down on the side of the road and they were the nearest auto repair location. A small shack barely noticeable from the street, I'm very happy that I stumbled upon this shop. Tony's Auto Repair is now my premier place to get my cars looked at for regular maintenance and automotive issues. Their staff are very knowledgeable in all types of vehicles, and they're prompt and professional when fixing your vehicle. They let you watch whenever they do anything, and are more than happy to teach you about your car. They work with you to get you the best deals, and will tell you like it is. I highly recommend this place.
5 Great and fast service. Most affordable shop I've come across in Phoenix/Glendale. Will continue to come here for regular maintenance!
