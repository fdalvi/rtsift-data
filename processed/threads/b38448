3 Brand new Starbucks just off the Waverley Steps and it already is bringing in loads of custom. Figures! Shove a Starbucks somewhere and people will flock from all over.   This Starbucks, although relatively new, acts like it's been running like a machine for a while now. The staff, like most baristas in Starbucks, are absolutely lovely and love having a chat whilst taking your payments or making your drinks. It's quite a spacious branch, with quite a lot of seating dotted all over the room, and plenty of plugs for charging your electrical equipment.   Pretty decent Starbucks as Starbucks go!
4 Plenty of comfortable seating. A great place to grab a coffee and use the wifi to get your bearings while in town.
4 A nice place to stop before hitting the town, plenty if seats and staff to serve so your not left long in a Que. This store can be found near the top of the stairs as you are about to leave the Waverley train station.
4 This Starbucks always seems to be busy, probably because its at the train stations. But there are always seats and the baristas move fast here so I feel I don't wait very long for my drink, makes up for the line time. Great place to kill 30 or 40 min till ones train arrives.
