5 My wife and I went to Olive's just this evening and had a most wonderful experience...The restaurant is cozy and reminiscent of tiny bistro.  Upon entering you are greeted by the chef and owner Tim who is more than welcoming and makes you feel at home immediately.  The food selection runs the Italian gamut...pizzas, pasta, salads, as well as great looking sandwiches and desserts.    I went for the gnocchi and my wife choose the pasta rustica...The gnocchi were butter soft and the homemade vodka sauce was killer ( get this dish! ), while my wife's rustica was sausage-y goodness!    The place is BYOB, however there is a liquor store next door that'll more than hook you up...    Go and you will love it, the owner, the ambiance...Oh yeah, and Elvis has been known to make appearances there!  I highly recommend this restaurant...Come with an empty stomach and be ready to take home a pizza to tide you over until your next visit!
4 I thought the food was very good. My wife and I had lunch. We started with a dinner salad followed by two entrees. She had gnocchi and I had chicken marsala. They were both very good. It has the ambience you find in Italy. There was some outdoor seating. It is a restaurant I shall return to. Plenty of food for a reasonable price.
