1 I was visiting from out of town and wanted to test with an agency while I was staying in Vegas. The one model I booked cancelled the day before our after having scheduled it weeks in advance. Apparently she didn't realize when her flight out of town was.   The other two models the agent sent me never responded to my numerous emails. The agent then said he would book someone else and he never got back to me either.   Unprofessional and a complete waste of time.

1 I 1000% agree with Standards H. on this agency.  Couldn't have said it better myself.  In the end, because we "talent" do actually work to make a living, to survive, I would not suggest working with them because if Daniel does pay you at all, it will be much later down the road.... I worked with Envy very consistently for about 4 years, but paychecks ALWAYS came VERY VERY VERY late, about 6 months later than jobs. At that point I was working for a few other agencies as well and could deal with the poor flow of money from Daniel, but he did persuade me to sign a nonexclusive contract, and in that time period for the first year, I have NEVER WORKED LESS in my life so I just disregarded it and started working for everyone again.  Contracts with him are not worth it.  They don't mean much in his eyes. He really could care less if you made enough money to eat or not. Huge ego. Not kind. Not professional.  Does have a great eye for models but doesn't matter in the end when you don't take care of your talent who all end up leaving you.
