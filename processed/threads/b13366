1 Worst customer service on multiple occasions - whether it be trying to demo a racquet or try out some shoes, you can be ignored in whole or in part for quite some time.  A lot of teens and early 20 something kids work here, and it shows.  Yet another place that bothers you with a stupid reward program that rarely yields a substantial benefit.  Location is in the SW part of the shopping area close to I-17, adjacent to where Circuit City used to be.
2 High Prices. No Service.  All the same merchandise you can get elsewhere.  Oh and these vegan pinko commie tree huggers don't carry hunting, shooting, archery supplies.  The outdoors goods are weak too.  If you like racquet sports and carrying a fanny pack this might be your shop - cause it ain't mine!  This is the next Borders Books.
3 A very large store with a wide variety of merchandise. I needed to buy a couple of pairs of black pants for work. I found 2 pair of Nike on the discount rack. I needed black shoes, but they didn't have anything I liked. The prices were good for me. Whenever I need more pants for work, I'll come back.  A couple of times I was asked if I needed any help. The guy who rang me up seemed pleasant. My experience with customer service was pretty good.
4 I had great servise here last weekend when I went to buy shoes. The store was fairly deserted but I'm a size 13, sometimes 14 shoe. The guy was very patient and helpful.
3 VERY high prices on most items, though they do have the advantage of a rather huge selection.  I come in for CO2 and SCUBA refills which they do efficiently and they are friendly and helpful.  Shopping here though will just empty your wallet.
