5 When the Meadows Mall Fred Meyer store closed, we tried to go to the next closest store at the Fashion Show Mall.    MISTAKE!  The service at the Fashion Show Mall was terrible and they were not very friendly.  Luckily, the store at the Galleria Mall is a bold contrast!  The service here is great, they are friendly and attentive.  Did some shopping here for mother's day and I oddly enjoyed my experience. (I usually do not even like setting foot in jewelry stores).   If you live on the West side of Las Vegas looking for a replacement for the now closed store at the Meadows Mall, I recommend taking the extra drive to the Galleria.
5 I have been shopping at this Fred Meyer's store for close to 10 years. I have always received superior customer service and am a repeat customer because of it.   Gertie Lucio has likewise been my go-to sales associate for almost 10 years. She has become like an extended family member over the years. She is always smiling, helps us find the perfect piece of jewerly to meet our needs and strives to give us the best deal everytime. I can't say enough good things about her! Even if Gertie is not in, the entire staff is courteous & helpful and I will not hesitate to have one of them assist me.  Fred Meyers always cleans our jewerly free of charge (even if it wasn't purchased at their store) and I love walking out with sparkling jewels! Tip: Try to purchase your jewelry when they have their huge sales around Valentine's Day, Super Bowl, Family & Friends Day, etc. We have gotten pieces up to 60% off :)
5 Always friendly service.  I usually just pop in when my ring needs to be cleaned or flashed.
