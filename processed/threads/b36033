4 I had to eat a quick lunch yesterday and the only thing in the neighborhood was a McDonald's.  Persconally, I love McDonald's but this day I just didn't feel like a burger (BYW: get two $1 McDouble's, remove the bottom buns, slap them together as a double, fabulous!)  But this day, I  bought a Southwest Chicken salad.  Seriously, the best $5 salad in town!  Whole, grilled breast, for $1 LESS than Chick Fil A and better.  Gotta run, really really good chicken salad!
3 Most of the time, I have no issues her. Food is good. Drive through is fast, although at times they get really busy and backed up. That is when it gets frustrating.  Especially when people sit talking on there phones instead of moving up. Throwing everything off.  The people who work there are nice nice, but you can tell that they rather have a job that pays more.  One good thing is tgat, they offer discount to uninformed police,  military and firefighters. Because they protect us. However,  that leaves out plainclothes police officers and detectives, FBi/CIA/TSA agents and security officer's. What are they? Chopped liver.  All and all, they are a good place to go. And I will go again.
3 The food is what it is but that Friggin Alarm is loud and seems management don't care
