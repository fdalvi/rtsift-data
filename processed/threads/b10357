1 Never again.  This business holds auctions that are accessible through the Live Auctioneers website.  During their March 12th auction, as an Internet bidder I won an item with a recorded hammer price of $150.00.  When I called them the next day to arrange payment and shipping, I was told they would send me an invoice within a couple of days.   After 7 days, I emailed them and finally got an invoice - with a hammer price of $200!  I called them and sent them the Live Auctioneer page showing my winning bid, and they agreed to correct their mistake.   Payment and shipping was arranged.  One day later, I received a call from them to say the item was no longer available - the consignor apparently didn't like the price it realized so he or she came and hauled it away.  Now, I could understand if the consignor had set a minimum bid or reserve price, but he or she hadn't, and legally I had won the item with my bid.  I will never do business with such a sloppily-run company again.
5 I have been going to most of their auctions for the last 3 or so years (ever since a neighbor told me about them). I have bought a few things over the years and (much to my wife's dismay) , I bought an animatronic fullsize GORILLA in the recent March auction!  They mostly auction off Slot Machines, Juke Boxes and advertising signs and lights, but they always seem to have something REALLY OFFBEAT in each auction! Fun stuff!  When I was picking up my Gorilla I saw a life-size Abraham Lincoln coming out for the October auction. I hope I am in town for their next auction. My monkey needs a friend!
5 Victorian Casino Antiques is a fun place to attend when the auctions are happening. And they have great collectible items, perfect for that "man cave" for the boys and great design items for visual effects in one's home. Lastly, the people who work there are great and very service oriented. I bought a antique trunk and a Disneyland poster from there. Check it out, either via internet or in person!
