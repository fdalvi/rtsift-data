They have billed me for the service plus an additional fee because the  account is 90 days past due,even tho they can't seem to submit the  correct information !  A Dellaventura
5 I have been a patient with this office since 2006.  Everyone is always so pleasant and caring.  Recently, I was a participant in an event for children from broken homes.  I told this office about the event, and they donated hygiene kits for all of the children.  They were all so excited!!  Thank you so much!!  I will see you in March for my next appointment!!
3 I went here to get my teeth checked out since my mouth had been keeping me awake for quite some time. The wait was really long to finally get taken back and they didn't look that busy. In fact, a couple walked in and had missed their appointment by like 4 hours and they did a little complaining so they took them back before any of us who had been waiting I'm the waiting room. When I finally got back they did my x-rays and told me I had an abscess and that's why I was hurting. They immediately went into a payment plan for a root canal and never wrote me a prescription for antibiotics. I also came for a cleaning and the little older lady that cleaned my teeth was one of the nicest and sweetest people I've met. If not for her I'd have given this place a 1 star. She really does her job well and was more informative than anyone else cared to be. I don't remember her name, but I loved her.
