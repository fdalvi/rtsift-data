4 I do love my cameras.  Taking a good photograph is something that I get a great deal of joy from.  Jessops is a great shop for all things camera, and it was their store on Shandwick Place that I visited today.  I mainly went in to have a look at their tripod range, as this is something that I've been thinking of purchasing.  Entering the shop was an oddly relaxing experience.  Unlike some stores, the walls and shelves were not crammed floor to ceiling.  Instead, the displays were laid out in an uncluttered manner that doesn't bombard your brain with a lot of information.    The store is quite large, and covers all aspects of photography.  You can get all sorts of cameras from small point-and-shoot right up to high-end digital SLRs.  They also stock binoculars and telescopes, along with accessories for all of these things.  I had a good look at their range of tripods, which covered a large price and size range.  Jessops is a must for either browsing or buying photographic equipment.  They also do printing and processing, and clearly know their stuff, having been around as a company for 75 years now.
1 Shop is really cool, and nicely "shop fitted " took ages to get served, I get the feeling a lot of customers go there to talk. Irritating if you just want supplies!  Going back through this review, as I'm sure a lot of you know this shop went under the the day after this review was originally written, and they're not honouring the gift vouchers I bought from them that day! So it quickly goes from 4 stars to 1star, mainly due to the theft of my money!
1 Great looking shop, there wasn't enough staff. Or they were too busy talking with customers took ages to get through the check out!   Yeah forget this!
