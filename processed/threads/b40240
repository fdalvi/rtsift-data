3 The Pita Pit is now open on Mill. I had the chicken caesar pita wrap. It was very tasty. Decent sized portions of chicken and bacon. Bacon was a nice touch! Although, I was a little surprised that Parmesan cheese wasn't an option...even though that was listed on the menu. Next time I will probably ask for a little more dressing.   Positive notes -good serving sizes -you can customize your pita however you want -they have some breakfast pitas that are available all day that sound interesting
4 Just ate at Pita Pit on Mill Ave for the first time the other night & loved it. They do it Subway style where you pick all of your toppings from a large assortment of veggies & dressings.  The Pita bread is soft & chewy, the veggies were fresh, the hummus was delicious. And the cherry on top was the super friendly service. There were 2 girls working & they couldn't have been nicer.  I see a lot of Falafels in my future.
2 healthy perhaps, flavor less ... for sure. lower the dance music so we can hear each other when placing an order. I ordered a gyro which was just Damn disgusting. This is the subway of pita joints. As a matter of fact subway is better. I'll consider eating elsewhere. sorry pita pit, but ya suck!
2 Kind of the opposite of the previous Pita Pit that was on University, clean and has great / friendly service, but the food leaves something to be desired. The pitas are too soft and doughy, and the chicken just doesn't look appetizing when they throw it on the grill (plus what I've noticed is they don't spend much time cooking the meat on the grill, just kind of throw it on there, then flip it around for a sec when they're ready to stuff it in your pita). Overall the taste just isn't as good as I've had at other Pita Pits. Will try back in a bit to see if it's improved.
4 Pretty good; a little confusing set up for me, but I think that's probably a corporate thing vs. a store thing. What I mean, is that  in this type of restaurant, you usually order/build your meal first and pay at the end. Here, you pay first (at the far end from the front door) and then work your way back to the front door.  That being said, the staff was nice, if not a little sleepy, and the food is pretty good.
5 Great place for a quick, flavorful lunch. To be perfectly honest, I'm not a huge fan of pitas because the ones I make myself turn out nasty and the ones I've had elsewhere haven't been much better.   The main problem I've seen in pita construction is the ingredients are inserted into yo pita in layers. This means you experience them in layers, in reverse order, as well. Say you stuffed yours with chicken, olives, lettuce, oil, and spices. Well, you will then taste...spices, oil, lettuce, olives, and chicken. Just like that.  Not here! They mix it well more like a subway sandwich (I'm a huge subway fan), and it all blends together like a beautiful orchestra.   Top ingredients, salad, options, and more too. Friendly crew working the counter as well.   I now appreciate the art of the pita.
5 Love the vegan options! Love the spicy options!  They are super  friendly here and also helpful.  Food was delicious.  NOT subway.  Ingredients are MUCH better quality and more variety.  Also 100-200 calories less than Subway.  Gross!  Pita Pit is SOOOOOOOOOO good!
