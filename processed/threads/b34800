5 Awesome place to focus on you and get in shape
5 I have been going here since this location opened. They have new equipment and I never have to wait for a treadmill or elliptical machine since they have so many.  Also you can't beat $10 a month with no contract.
4 $10 per month....no contract!!! Also, the TVs built into the cardio equipment makes "treadmill time" a little more bearable. Not lovin' the purple and neon green scheme they got hapnin, but its worth putting up with to have to get locked into one of those deceptive, heavy handed contracts that fuggup yer credit and haunt your existence.
5 great workout place! It is clean, doesn't smell like a gym, the staff is way friendly - and all the people there are welcoming and fun. Modern equipment, lots of machines and a supportive vibe. I live in Los Angeles and have great gyms to compare it with....super cool.
