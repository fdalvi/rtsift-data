3 The service was good and the food was decent.  It's halfway in between Phoenix and Tucson.  It's clean and appears to be family run.  All pluses in my book.  The food was decent and I'd return to try more.
2 If Eva's was located next to a Taco Bell I would be stumped as to which I would prefer.  Pros. Hmmm......the parking lot is never over full.
1 Awful excuse passed off as Mexican food.  It tasted as if the food had been prepared HOURS ahead of our arrival.  Nothing memorable or worth coming back for.  And add to that, it was not cheap. Strangely, it was like pulling teeth to get salsa and chip refills and they never delivered water for our party.  Additionally, the meals for the kids in our party arrived significantly after the rest of the adult's meals.  Isn't that backwards? Go somewhere else, this place is nasty.
4 I don't know what everybody is talking about. I have family in central Arizona and we frequently eat at Eva's. We have always found their service to be adequate, their prices reasonable, and the food quite good. I also love the chips and salsa they serve with warm refried beans.
