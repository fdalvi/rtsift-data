5 Go! Be happy! Try the PLT, NO, NOT BLT. Edgy fun attitude with terrific flavours. Lasagna is also very good.

Quick update: So after having been unable to go for a while, I finally made it back to this fantastic place and a quick tour of the new (to me anyway) Back Door! Holy great place to be, Batman! Dianne and Sian are as welcoming as ever. damn I've missed my weekly fix! Still the best sandwiches and pasta dinners in town! Yes, Vincenzo's has more to choose from, but the PLT rules my palette.
5 This review is for the back door, which is located through the door around the back of nostra cucina. It's aptly named. Everything about the restaurant is fabulous. Great ambiance, the wait staff is incredible and they make their own pasta. I love their spaghetti and meatballs, their back door salad and the tuscan onion soup.  Just go. You won't regret it.
