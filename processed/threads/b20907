3 This is a decent cafe that serves some pretty decent food at good prices. It is located not too far from Murrayfield Stadium and makes for a good place to come before watching some rugby.  The place from the outside looks a bit grubby and inside it looks pretty 80's in terms of decor- not sure this was an intentional style they were going for and rather it just hasn't been done up since then. However it does do a  pretty good all day breakfast, and I opted for a full Scottish breakfast and the portions you get are quite generous- I got 2 slices of toast, egg, bacon, beans, 2 sausages, black pudding and mushrooms all for Â£4.50. The sausages were a bit greasy and the beans seemed that they were overcooked as they tasted a bit dry, but other than that it was a good meal at great value. The cafe also does a good range of other food including fish and chips, rolls and sandwiches.
3 The stereotypical greasy spoon cafe and by saying this I mean it as a great compliment.  Please do not expect silver service when visiting the Roseburn Caf, nor fluffy cakes and dainty French pastries.  However please do expect a tasty home style fry-up, tea, coffee and friendly folk happy to put more rather than less on your plate.  A great place to come the morning after with your newspaper and headache in tow...and bring your appetite!
