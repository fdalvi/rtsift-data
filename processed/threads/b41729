5 As a long-time believer in the benefits of massage, I feel very fortunate to have found OneSelf. I've been getting massages for about 15 years. Sometimes I want a massage for relaxation, but more often I'm looking for relief of problems related to being hard on my body and my unrelenting gym schedule. For almost a year, the work I get done at OneSelf has been keeping me going. The aches, pains, muscle weakness/tightness from working out and playing sports will move around from place to place on my body but OneSelf is always able to provide relief.   Their membership deal is also the best in town! For a mere $50 annual fee you get access to drastically reduced prices for yourself and gift certificates. The membership at OneSelf is truly a value especially when you consider the quality of work they do compared to the other membership places. These massage therapists are experienced and they have a philosophy guiding them. They work hard to fix YOUR issues and have the knowledge to improve your ailments.  If you are as much as a fan of the benefits of massage as I am you owe it to yourself to make an appointment asap. Tell them what you need and they'll find solutions.  They're also offering yoga now, which is cool. You can schedule a session for just before or after your massage then you can straighten out your mind and body in the same visit!  Give it a shot! I bet you'll feel benefits after your first visit!
5 I absolutely love OneSelf- great customer service-amazing massage- always giving back to their customers! Best place around.
