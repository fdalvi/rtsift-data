3 Prices here are what you would expect from a College bookstore- high, but they do have pretty much everything you may need, from meds to pencils and calculators, snacks, and shirts, notebooks and even magazines and used, low priced movies.  Books are what they are- expensive. The only issue I have with this place is the fricken lines. Why are we constantly changing the way the lines work here? One semester the line is over there, the next semester it is on the other side of the room, and forced behind the book shelves so anyone just coming in cannot see it. Stop being so Bipolar with the lines! Other than that, it is a pretty decent place, and the return policies are pretty cool.
1 I will never use online bookstore again!And will never recommend  to anyone!I ordered 2 books online got confirmation email that my books are ready to pick up and of course they weren't ready! They gave me one of the books!I told them that I would like to cancel my other book order,and purchase it in store.They told me that I have to wait until my other book arrives,go back to store pick it up and then I can get my money back!!!At least 5 more people in line had the same problem,they had emails from the store that order is ready to pick up and it wasn't ready!!!They told one guy that he will have to wait a week to get his stuff!!! Save yourself time and NEVER order online,just go to the book store in person.Usually the store has everything in stock unlike the online store.
1 Horrible customer service. Dont waste your time and go someplace else and.save money.
