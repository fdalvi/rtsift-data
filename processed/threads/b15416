5 This newly remodeled location is absolutely delightful. I just relocated to phoenix and was pleased to have Village Inns. Definitely beats IHop or Denny's hands down.
3 If you've seen one Inn, you've seen all Inns. Only, most I've seen are shutting down faster than the Democrats will be leaving Congress this year. Nevertheless, I'm happy this particular one on Northern Ave and the Loop 101, is still in business.  Very clean, well laid out - even for its smaller size and it had an extremely friendly staff to both me and my father - who happens to be so much a regular, he says he'll have his regular and they recite back to him precisely what it was just to be sure. Rarely do you see that, especially in a chain. They were also extremely friendly with me, and happy to meet his son.  That all said, let's get down to the food. Oh, boy, it was, well, Luby's quality. I had chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes, corn, clam chowder soup and it came with a biscuit and soft butter. Let's start with the positive: the chicken fried steak and it's seasoned gravy was very good. As was the biscuit and butter - that was delicious warm/soft butter. The soup was only adequate with its enormously small chunks of meat inside. The mashed potatoes were actually wet and/or runny inside - it was edible, but not by much. And finally the corn. How can you mess that up? Well, enough for me to take one bite and push it over to my father who must be used to it by now. That was the worst.  But, if the corn's the worst, then is the whole place not worth visiting? By all means NO...the staff and ambiance sincerely makes up for any shortcomings.   (Overall rating: 3.5/5 Stars. The following is rated by "out of five" stars.)  Ambiance: 4 - Very nice looking inside, well laid out.  Service: 5 - extremely friendly and personable.  Food Taste: 3 - see above.  Food Quality: 4 - well presented.  Cleanliness: 5 - Very clean, down to the restrooms.  Friendly Staff: 5 - See above.  Fast Busing: 5 - the waiter did all that, and extremely efficient, always with a smile and a chuckle.  Smoking Area: Outside to the immediate right. Not bad, includes a sitting area for smokers.  Would I Return?: If my father wanted to. I wouldn't go out of my way.  Would I Recommend?: Yes...sort of....  And to who?: If someone lived within 5 miles of it and if they were on a tight budget.  Additional Information: Without having to, the staff treated my father with the utmost respect and courtesy while showing genuine concern that his visit was enjoyable. If they did that for one person, chances are they will treat you the same way. Kudos to the hiring staff.
3 All of these Village Inn are the same, but that is where the servers can stand out.  This location is very clean and laid out the same like the one in Avondale.    I got the chicken fried steak skillet.  The chicken fried steak is good, the gravy has good, the fried potatoes cubes are nice and cripsy, and the scramble egg to top it off was good.    The server was so busy, she was all over the place but we were still checked on.
4 I don't really like breakfast foods, but they do have a good selection of other options. I prefer this over Ihop and Dennys. Prices are reasonable and the service is very nice.  I like their multigrain pancakes. Soups are okay. Clean bathrooms.
4 Good place for breakfast.  They have a $6.99 breakfast deal, pick four entrees. I had a two egg omelet, biscuits and gravy, hash browns, and a  yummy strawberry crepe. Very good!  Good standard fare and very predictable.  The servers are friendly and take good care of you.  Just a nice easy place to have a meal.
3 Pretty standard fare.  Hostess and waitress very friendly and quickly seated.  We were there for lunch and the place was not super busy but I though our wait for food was long considering we ordered sandwiches.  I had the half sandwich, soup, and pie for $7.49 which seemed a little steep for Denny's type food and atmosphere.  My wife had a turkey sandwich which was $8.69.  Most restaurants run lunch specials and this was it so not impressed.  The chili was very common and could have come from a can, doubt it was 'homemade' , the Reuben was good as was the turkey sandwich but all in all, will not go back, too many restaurants with better food and better prices.
5 Gawd!!!! It's embarrassing to give a VI five stars but this one earned each star today!    First, it was NOT packed and we got a table with no wait at 1100 on a Sunday morning.  Second, from the hostess to the manager to the cook who waved at me from the kitchen, EVERYONE was warm, friendly, polite, helpful, and dare I say, downright CHEERFUL.  Third, our server, Jennifer, was five star all the way... She was high class and high quality, WTF is she doing working at a VI?????  Oh yeah, she was making my freakin' day, that's what she's doing working at a VI!!!!  Thank you Jennifer!  So we really took note that while we thought we had the BEST WAITRESS EVER, that all the other waiters and waitresses were equally professional, cheerful, and efficient.  WOW!!!!  Again, at a VI???   I am perplexed, confused... VI was always a quick, semi-crappy meal with a tweaked out server and non-existent support personnel... But I must now confess that we will be back so see if we were delusional due to lack of sleep or if this is a whole new VI.  I haven't even talked about the food... Like the service, this was the best food we have ever had at a VI... double bacon skillet was phenomenal, fully loaded double cheeseburger was moist and flavorful... Pancakes, made the pancakes at Sear's in SF look silly, yeah, that yummy (at a dang VI!!!!!)!  We will be back, we will bring momma, looking forward to elation at the consistency or absolute disappointment... But today, five f-ing stars!!!!!
5 Very good place for breakfast and their pies are to die for.  We've been here about five times and they never seem to be crowded, which is a shame.  Their staff is always friendly and the food is always good.  It's like a Dennys-type place, but I think the food tastes better.  I've honestly never had a lunch or dinner item but I don't think that's what you go here for :)  The prices are very reasonable.  Once again, pies are TO DIE FOR! We've had their strawberry pie (x2), pumpkin pie, peanut butter chocolate pie and most recently, their mixed berry pie.  We're going to be moving across the valley and I'm actually a little upset this location won't be coming with us.
3 I have to say... I've always eyed this place with suspicion both aesthetically and gastronomically.  Anyone who says their pies are the best has not been to Marie Calendars...   I came in with an open mind and left with a full belly so here's the run down:  Dinner salad with blue cheese dressing was a hands down winner. The dressing was amazing. I even used the saltines they brought me to eat the chunks of blue cheese on!  The Cuban pita sandwich was A-OK, as were the fries. Service was efficient and friendly.  My pie... meh... was not impressed at all... but that's OK. It got the job of putting way too many calories into my body from one meal sitting.  I had water to drink and thank goodness!  The decor was cute and modern, I was actually surprised at it. I was expecting something schlubby or dumpy. It was not.  Best part of the night was being rung up by a cashier/server who had a long, long, coke/crystal sniffing pinky nail.  Stay classy Glendale!
5 I live an exit away I can't believe I'm just now coming here after 4months. Food was delicious, nothing fancy or pretty just tastes great. Raymundo was our server and he was so nice! All the waiters and waitresses seemed friendly and close as they joked with one another and working quickly but very well together. Customer Service is more than half of the reason I keep coming back to places. You either got it or you don't and this place has it!
3 I grew up with Village Inn.  I love this place.  The food is consistently great.  Love the Eggs Benedict (classic), Country Skillet is tasty, coffee is always fresh!!  And somehow in two visits we went from amazing service to zero in a flash. Props to the Saturday morning crew.  You were ALL on your A game, with personality and prompt service.  Not so much for the Tuesday morning gals.  Left very unhappy, refills would have been nice, a to go box would have been great, and all of this would have happened if you ever checked back in with the table after dropping the food...

1 AWFUL-HORRIBLE-TERRIBLE! NEVER going back there again. Me and my girlfriend ordered the Build Your Own breakfast deal, awful mistake. First of all if you order 2 of the same thing you get charged another Dollar which is rediculous, then when we get our food it's like a Kids Meal portion: COLD potatoes and there were like 8 little potatoes, COLD hash browns, the side of fruit has 2 pieces of melon and 4 grapes, and a HALF of a waffle, side of fries had about 10 fries on it. We were there about an hour and a half and ate our food in 2 minutes STILL hungry and already had spend $28, server was rude and didn't ask us how our food was or anything, it was like she sensed our dis-satisfaction and just felt we were a lost cause at that point. Then the grand finale, the general manager Cesar Real asked us how our meal was and I told him awful and explained all these issues and he pretty much said "well those are the portions we give here so sorry about that" no discount for shitty cold food or awful service not any type of anything to help out, and this is their manager. Twice the price and Half the portions of Denny's. I will never go back here again ever, horrible.
1 My boyfriend and I have been here a few times in the last 6 months and I don't know why we keep going back.   The food always tastes fairly good, however their service is horrible.   Our waitress, whom we've unluckily had the last 2 times we were there, is awful.  This recent time, my boyfriends specifically asked for no tomatoes on his burger, guess what it came with tomatoes.  Not a huge deal but would have been nice if it had been correct.   She never asked me once if I wanted another drink, but kept my boyfriends drinks refilled.   We finished our meal and sat there while she kept walking by us, clearly seeing I needed a to go box and never once asked. Finally I caught her and asked her for one.    I wish I could remember her name, blonde, hair in a ponytail all the time, young and clearly waitressing isn't her thing, otherwise she would have paid more attention to our needs.  If I had been paying she would have gotten zero for a tip, she didn't deserve one at all.   Then we went to go pay and leave, however stood and waited, and waited, and waited to even be waited on so we could go.  The cashier/waitress asked my boyfriend how his food was, but didn't ask me.   I think the place needs some work on their people and service skills.    Time to find a new location and give them a try.  We probably wont go back to this one anytime soon.
1 So, I was going to give the VI 2 stars... but then I realized I would be messing up my rating system since I only have 5 stars to give.  I got there at 6 AM, and I was the only person in the restaraunt. I don't mean there weren't many people, I mean I was literally the ONLY guest. This is an important item which I will explain shortly.  I ordered the Denver Omelet, and it took forever for me to get my food. When I did finally get it, the omelet was runny and practically egg soup all over my plate. The pancakes tasted like they were burnt and stale, completely dry and disgusting. I'm the only person in there... I could see messing up someone's order when the place is full, and you're rushing to get out orders... but when only ONE person is in there, how could you possibly mess up eggs and pancakes?  While I was eating, the waitress set up another table for 4 people with coffee cups and glasses of water. So I wondered if she had regulars coming in that she expected. She spent more time catering to the table she was setting up than she did checking on me/asking if I needed anything. In fact, she changed the channels on the TV's and setup the other table the whole time I was eating and only checked on me as the other guests got there, and I interrupted her for a box to-go. I threw my food away as I walked out... I'm not really sure why I asked for a box.  Absolutely terrible food, terrible service. I will never go to this VI again... I've heard "you've been to one, you've been to all of them" - but this is by far, the worst one I have ever seen.
4 My husband and I were sat right away.  Our server was very attentive which is a kind of novelty at this type of restaurant.  Our food came out rather quickly and my coffee never ran dry.  What more could I ask for?
3 We stopped into VI the night before Thanksgiving for a quick bite. I'll forgive the minor service issues because they seemed a bit overrun with people picking up pies for the holiday. Our waitress was great, on point with refills and such and very friendly. The food was good. The pie was good. The price was good. I'll give them another try sometime to see if the lobby problems were Thanksgiving pie created or not...
1 Unfortunately, zero stars is not an option here!  Absolutely the worst service and food I've ever had the displeasure if experiencing. Being that we were at Village Inn, my hopes weren't high to begin with, but our options in this area are limited. My coffee was cold, toast was not toasted, egg did not resemble a poached egg, the sauce tasted sour, avocado was brown and my potatoes were mush. In our time at the establishment, three additional tables had problems with their orders and had part of their bills compensated. The "manager" never once came to any of our tables to address the issues. Instead, he sat on the counter at the check-out...doing nothing. Save yourself the dissatisfaction of coming here. From a business standpoint, wow, the money they must lose at this location.
4 I really enjoyed the multi grain pancakes this morning, service was great as well.
