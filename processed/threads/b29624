5 This company went above and beyond to assist us and I can't thank them enough.  My neighbors will be giving them a call as they could see the dedication and commitment to resolving our problem even if it was on Halloween (so added business will be coming their way)!  JD & David worked diligently to resolve our dryer vent situation in our two story house!  We are going to have them come back to do the rest of the air vents even though we have had all of this done within the last two years as it was evident the initial company we hired did not do a good job..
5 We bought a house and wanted to have the air ducts cleaned before moving in.  After researching many companies I decided to go with Air Quality Specialists, and am so happy I chose them.  They came out to clean the air ducts, dryer vent and as part of the service seal any obvious leaks, and clean the coils on the air handler.  They were on time, informative and did an excellent professional job.  Then my ac unit did not seem to be cooling well.  I called and had an HVAC tech sent out by the home warranty company and after an inspection he called me to the attic and showed me that the air ducts were leaking as they came off the air handler which was cooling the attic instead of my home.  I called Air Quality Specialists and they sent some one out promptly who fixed the problem with absolutely no hassel at all.  It is so refreshing to get good customer service as it doesn't seem to exist in many places these days.  I will refer all I know to this company and have them out to inspect my air ducts on a yearly basis.
