1 Unprofessional and rude.  I scheduled for them to come out and haul away some landscaping from my yard, and when I had something come up and called him three days in advance to reschedule, our phone call got "disconnected" (I think he hung up on me?), then he emailed me saying he had decided he cannot work for me.    Can't speak for the quality of their work, but interacting with them was an unforgivably bad (and weird) experience.
4 I used this company to excavate my yard and had no complaints. There was a last minute reschedule on their end, but it was pretty unavoidable and didn't affect my schedule in any way, so I was good with it. This is a three man crew and I didn't experience any rudeness at all! They went beyond the scope of work that was discussed and I'm having them clear out my front yard soon. Pricing is good too - overall a good experience for me!
