1 This was probably the worst experience I've ever had at a dry cleaner. Go here only if you want to pay Chicago prices, you want your alterations to be ugly and amateurish, and you want to be sent home with dirty clothes a week after their promised ready date, after paying those ridiculous prices.   Disappointed. The manager was pretty much non-reactive when I noticed my winter coat still had stains on it.
1 I run a business in an industry that refers customers to dry cleaners. I have heard many complaints about TLC and also have had a run in with the owner. I am very knowledgeable about dry cleaning and would never send one of my customers there. On the west side of town go to Best Cleaners, Middleton Cleaners, Lake Mills or Yee's. Avoid TLC and the chain places.
1 I haven't even picked up my item yet but I had a horrible experience with the woman at the front desk today. She was so rude and unprofessional. Her acting like this would def. discourage me from ever going back. There are plenty of other drycleaning places in Madison I'd rather bring my business to, thanks to her.
