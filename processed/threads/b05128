4 Grabbed a quick bite here today and I was impressed.  I thought this place would be like a Taco Bell but was suprised that the food was actually pretty good.  They mostly have a simple mexican fast food menu but, they also sell burgers and have a small breakfast selection available all day.  I didn't have any problems with my order however another customer from the drive-thru came in with a complaint.  They fixed their mistake quickly and without hassle.  Prices are good and the portions are huge.  They also got an A from the health department, so I'll be back.

4 Thumbs up for the 50 cents - 1 dollar menu. Just got a 2 full bags of food for 2 and two drinks for 8 bucks. Taco bell's menu of cheap items are left in the dust here. Food is fresh for fast food.
5 great Tacos here Write off taco bell
1 I guess their "open 24hrs" sign is just for looks, or maybe they were too busy checking facebook on their smartphones at 2:30am on a saturday night, it's all good cause jack in the box ALWAYS has prompt service..  maybe next time huh?..
