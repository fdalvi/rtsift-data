4 This is a very good store.  You can't really rave about the ice cream, if you've been to one BR you've been to them all, but the service at this one is great.  It's under new ownership, about a year or so.  It is a staple of our at least once a week, especially on $1 scoop Tuesday's.
3 The ice cream is really good, and they do have a good flavor selection.   I am giving it a 3 star is because we have been here several times, and the tables/floor always seem to need cleaned.  The service and employees are always good, but nothing great.  Other ice cream parlors seem to have more charismatic employees (joke and talk to you beyond just taking yoour order)   This store the employees seem to have lots of fun with each other, but don't want to talk with you beyond getting your order.    **I would really suggest going across the road to Yogurt Jungle**  awesome....skip baskin robins with a work of art like yogurt jungle so close
3 The ice cream is always great and good selection. The staff on the other hand, seem miserable and you can tell they don't want to be there.
