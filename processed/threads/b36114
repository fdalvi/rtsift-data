5 I wish I lived in Tempe to have these guys as my mechanics. We've been traveling around the country for 6+ months in our '85 Chevy Winnebago. So we've obviously needed repairs along the way. Of all the shops we've been to, not one has compared to this father/son duo.   I've never been more impressed by such teamwork. They want to listen to every part of your experience before trying to diagnose the problem. Then, give them 10 minutes, and they come back with the problem part in hand. Showing you what's wrong with it.   Aside from being logical and efficient with diagnosing, they value the quality work they do. They went above and beyond, thoroughly checking and testing our '85 Winnebago to make sure we'd make it home safely.  They care about their customers. They care about the work they do. And they make sure they're always having fun doing it!  These guys are awesome.
5 TRULY FANTASTIC service! Affordable rates! Enough said!   You will not be sorry. The best mechanics I've ever utilized and thenicest guys you'll ever meet.
