5 Awesome facility, great service provided by onsite manager Courtney and extremely helpful. I like the underground facility for the reason my equipment will not be subject to the intense heat.
5 This place is great. Clean, safe and well lit.  Most of the staff is very helpful. Courtney and Jen go above and beyond to help out. These are the employees you hope continue to stay with PS. They are pleasant and are willing to make the extra step to help with the small tasks that others dismiss as 'not my job'.  I don't know if there is any extra perks for signing up but I would wait for Jen or Courtney. These people are capable and understanding. They are very helpful. If I were new and looking to rent, I would avoid Shirley.
5 Courtney is the manager and she is the best!  I love the facility, very clean and feels safe.  Great online prices.  Would recommend for personal storage.
