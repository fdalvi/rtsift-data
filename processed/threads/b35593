5 It's the food stupid. No really it's not the location or fancy design or catchy name or any other thing , at the end of the day it's the food. Yes it's not in the best area but in Las Vegas what is a good neighborhood. I walked in on a Saturday and the place was packed. It  and  menu is full of traditional Southern Foods, Fried Chicken, Catfish, Bar b Que and other items that they will cook to order-can you imagine some fancy strip or downtown restaurant doing that?
5 I had pork chops, potatoes and eggs. Delicious. The sign spinners advertising the place made me curious. Glad I went in.  I would go here again. Price was right and I even had enough food to share. People beg when they smell good food!
4 Very light and crispy catfish.  Small little market with a "hot food" area.  There is also a small sit down area.  It gets very busy but worth the wait.  The price of the combos are also very reasonable.
