4 I liked the place even when I thought it was a chain.  I REALLY liked it when I found out it was independently owned and operated.  I've been here lots of time - but I don't even remember much about the pizza.  It was good, and other folks liked it, but I got the lasagna the first time I went there and it was so good, it's hard to try other things.  I've strayed a bit, but I keep going back to that.    Huge portions and a fun family atmosphere - though when all the seats are full it can get a bit tight.  It's not a huge place, but big enough I thought it was a chain though it's an independent building.    Meals run $12 to $23 ish, but they also run HUGE.  And not only can you share, but if you tell them you're sharing then for a few bucks more they'll split it onto 2 plates and give you an extra dinner salad.  Definitely a bonus.    Last note - if you go when the weather is nice they have a really great outdoor seating area.  The chairs aren't special, but the sides and top are covered w/ really pretty vines.  Perfect way to eat good Italian food - al fresco.
