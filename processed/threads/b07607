1 This Chuys moved and is now just east of 7th St on Greenway Parkway.
5 This Chuy's has moved to a brand new location at 830 E. Greenway. Just East of 7th St. on the North side of Greenway.  You know why Chuy's is a great place?  The food is good, the service is good, the new location is clean and well lit.  Everytime I go there they smile and say Hello.  When I leave they say goodbye.  I actaully think they mean it.    Chips and salsa all you can eat. Margaritas are actually one of my favorites. The new  "Street Tacos" are fantastic. The beans and rice are healthy and taste good.  And my absolute favorite part... they open early 7 days a week.  Good clean service.  That's what makes a business successful.
1 I went to Chuy's on Greenway for lunch today.  It looks the same as before the raid, except for the staff.  Menu and ordering is the same. The chips and salsa are pretty much the same.    I order the  chicken ala-cart.  I was very surprised at what I got.  They brought me a basket with one piece of chicken breast cut in half.  I asked the server if that was right.  He said the cook had "weighted it out".  I said it was suppose to be  of a chicken not  pound.  I paid $7.64 for one piece of chicken and a glass of iced tea.
