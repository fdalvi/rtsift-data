4 I like Hot Topic. They have all the Alice stuff a crazily obsessed Wonderland nerd could ask for. They also have oodles of Disney, Hello Kitty, and Cartoon Network before it was kinda lame. I just get a little creeped out by the employees. I think that they're going to sneak up behind me while I'm marvelling at a Cheshire Cat shirt and stab me with a Jack Skellington pin (it's OK because I like Jack). Also, it isn't properly lit in most locations, and that is safety hazard, my friend. It also gives you a goth reputation for some reason. If you second that notion, go onto their website and look at their "The Little Mermaid" shirts. So give the store chance. You'll probably find something you like.
2 Hot Topic used to be about the music. Now, they're about what's "in". This particular location is weird. The people who work there are less than helpful and any time I walk in, I feel like I'm being watched. Plus, recently, they've pretty much shut off the lights, so it's extremely dark in there. It's kind of irritating when most of the store is black to begin with.
