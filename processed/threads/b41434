1 For the price of this place, I expected much more! The concierge was average at best and the decor was overly dated. The hallways smelled old and looked worn. Then they had a bar that was never open and a breakfast you had to pay for!!
3 I made the mistake of reading some of the reviews a few hours before arriving at the hotel. After reading the horrible reviews, I was terrified. However, upon arriving at the hotel, I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel was outdated, yes, but also very clean. The room is a decent size. My only complaint about the actual room is that the (very old) tv is positioned at an angle that literally faces a wall. So it's impossible to watch it from the bed or chair. It's also not the kind of tv you can easily turn around, since it's so huge.  We had some trouble with the sink not turning off - but the hotel staff sent someone up to fix it within 5 minutes.  I didn't feel like I was welcome when I arrived at the front desk, but I guess I wasn't treated horribly either. Overall, good value for the price we paid.   Update: after they weren't able to fix the sink, they moved us to another room with a flat screen tv! Jackpot!
