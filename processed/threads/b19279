4 The only problem I have with this place is that the sheer number of choices is dazzling.  Health nuts simply can't pass this place up. Pure vitamin bombs.
4 The staff at the uptown location make better, richer smoothies than the ones I've had at the King/Uni location. I don't know why that is but the K/U ones we've had have been chalky or "off"-tasting, while the uptown ones are delicious. The staff are pleasant and friendly too, and you never have to wait long in line.
3 All the juices I have tried always tasted good. But after they changed there cup sizes, raised the prices and charged for the booster, I thought it wasnt worth the money especially when your main customers are students on a budget.
