4 This place is WAY bigger than it appears from outside!  I needed lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves for hot & sour soup.  I got that.  Along with baby bok choy, curry paste, Piknik snacks and a couple of other things. Produce aisle isn't all labeled, so I had to ask for help.  They didn't have the lime leaves out.  The little man found me in another part of the store with a package of them.   There are aisles and aisles of all sorts of Oriental foods.  I could have spent a couple of hours in there exploring, but wasn't feeling so hot.  That's why I wanted to make the soup in the first place. Strange odor near produce section, but I don't question those sorts of things.   Spent $10 and walked out with a big bag o' stuff.
5 great prices and you can get all the speciality ingredients that you need  great bun bao made fresh - pick up a few
5 Great place to for fresh basil, lemon grass, limes, snow peas, and other Asian ingredients.There is a wonderful selection of spices at bargain prices compared to any of the grocery stores. The yam and yucca cakes are extraordinary!
3 This place is OK.  It is a pretty good size market with good variety.  Prices are not as low as other markets.  It also could be cleaner.  Especially the bathroom.  It looked as if it had not been cleaned in months!  Also the soap dispenser was empty.  there was dish washing soap on the counter I guess you are supposed to use.  They were also out of paper towels, so how are the employees washing their hands?  They also sell prepared food there.
