5 No longer Bicycle Showcase is now Bicycles of Scottsdale. A little bit of a remodel but still a very good shop! Great staff!
5 Now called Bikes of Scottsdale. Just bought two Phat beach cruisers from this fabulous shop! Marcus was so great and patient with us. He was the perfect example of providing an exceptional customer experience.  Don't shop around, just go here. Marcus and William will take great care to help you get the bike you want. Thanks, guys!
5 Friendly staff, no pushy salesmen, decent selection of Giant bikes
4 This store is a fine place to shop for a bike. I went in looking for a cruiser and Ross could not have been nicer.  The customer service was great. The only reason I can't give the store five stars is because of selection. They had no men's three-speed cruisers in stock and I was dying to walk out of there with a new three-speed.  Bikes of Scottsdale is a nice bike store but on this day selection was very limited. If you are shopping for a bike, I recommend making this store one of your first stops and having Ross help you. I would have purchased here but found another bike that I liked better at one of their competitors.
