5 Gibson Air has been repairing and maintaining our office and warehouse air conditioners and swamp coolers for the past 2 years and they never disappoint! Their technicians are always clean, professional and extremely nice and explain everything that is going on in a way that I can actually understand. I HIGHLY recommend them! Don't bother getting bids from others, I already did the legwork! Gibson Air's prices are very reasonable and are always quick to respond!
5 I have used a lot of Air Conditioning repair people and this company is the best.  Reasonable pricing, awesome repair technicians, no pressure sales, and QUICK to respond day or night.  They don't charge extra for weekends or evenings.  Above all else they are very honest, repairing quickly and efficiently.  They really are amazing.  I highly recommend them!!!!
5 They rock!
3 I had to get a relative's A/C fixed in a hurry -- family medical emergency.  I called Gibson based on Yelp reviews, but later began to wonder whether the owners and/or their friends had written these reviews. On the plus side:   After a day in which a (very expensive) part was obtained, the unit was promptly fixed and seems to be working fine. On the minus side:  I was spending all my time at a hospital, so pre-paid for the repair (scary!).  The technician who came out was generally uncommunicative and distant (Asperger's?).  Then, getting a receipt (to be reimbursed by the family estate executor -- but I should have had a receipt in any case) was like pulling teeth.  You would've thought I was asking for the money back!  The phone clerk, when I asked the second time, behaved as though **I** were at fault because I didn't get a receipt the first time!  Then, of course, when I finally got a receipt, my name was badly misspelled. So it isn't all nice breezes with this company.
