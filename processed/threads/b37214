5 This spa is a hidden gem!!! Lily the therapist did an amazing job! Def the perfect spot for your weekly massage!
2 I had Lilly as my masseuse and had an appointment for a 1 hour massage. I got a little lost finding the property and arrived 5 after. I was on the bed and ready to go at 12:15.   Unfortunately, my massage only lasted about 35 minutes because she had a 1pm appointment. Lily said she was not able to credit me the time.   Though she was very attentive, I felt  disrespected when my one hour massage was cut off so early. I left only half fulfilled, disappointed in the service, and pretty jipped. I would have appreciated a voucher or something as an apology.   I was hoping this would be my local go to place since I come for work often, but I guess I'll have to keep looking.
5 This is way long overdue... I supposed to give this review sooner.  I was in Vegas back in May and I called and spoke to Lily about getting a massage on a late Sunday afternoon. She kindly found and scheduled me a 60 minute appointment for the very next day! I prefer light massages and she made sure my masseuse matched the type of massage I needed.  This was my first time getting a massage from Spa at Tuscany and the experience was really, really, really great. I went in there with sore thighs and lower back from cycling/running and when the session was over I walked out of there with no pain at all!  I received the therapy I needed from Andrea.  You know when you get a massage; the masseuse goes over that one spot that you're like "oh yeah, right there"! Well that was pretty much my whole massage, and before I could even say those words I'd hear Andrea say lightly "there it is" and proceed to dig deeper into the muscle to loosen it up  I truly do recommend Lily and, of course, Andrea!  They're so friendly, professional, and love what they do.
