3 A sentimental favorite, not only for the chicken ranch sandwich (crispy breaded chicken breast w/tangy wing sauce, cool Ranch dressing, lettuce & tomato), but also because at 16, I met my first Pinoy boyfriend here (he was the busboy).  It didn't last, obviously, but I'll always look back on that moment fondly. You know, before he dumped me on my birthday and asked for his jacket back.
5 still cookin when it arrives at the table!!!  i ordered the cyo (choose your own) fajitas mixed grill(chicken,steak & shrimp(lime)) with choice of toppers i had bell peppers & onions-portabello mushrooms & jalapenos  nice & clean, almost all boothes, lots of room in the bar, need a few more tv's & some music-a little quiet for such a busy place super friendly, very helpful in ordering & on top of the refills!!! what more could you ask!!  lets start with the chips-fresh & hot-thin & crispy and the salsa was hot & tasty!!! the fajitas were as good as they looked. the portabello was delicious!! the guacamole was so fresh you could taste all the cilantro & lime and spicy jalapeno!!! the soup was so cheesy if you added macaroni & baked it you'd have casserole!! yummy!! the salad was fresh & crispy with fresh tomatoes & real 1000 island.. the grilled shrimp were cooked perfectly and were plump & limey!! no complaints superb service & food. the atmosphere was a little tame for las vegas standards. but if you want a nice sunday after church spot chili's is nice. food is tops -everything coming out looked great
5 SO SO sad..............without warning this location is NOW CLOSED.
5 I love Chili's Bar & Grill. Try the new Shinerbok burger, its the best!
