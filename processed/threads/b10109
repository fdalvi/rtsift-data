5 Closed Sundays.   I typically stay at the Golden Nugget downtown and you can't  just gamble, drink, eat, gamble, drink and drink.   I guess you can because I sure have in the past but now I take a 10 minute walk to the local plunge. Nothing reinvigorates me like a long, leisurely swim. Then it's back to drink, gamble, drink, party, you get the idea.   The pool (50y but 25y lap lanes) is heated, indoors, and only a couple of dollars. They have locker facilities but I have never used them.   5 stars. This is the local plunge and not the Ritz.
5 Excellent lap-swimming facility.  Older building but very well-maintained, many many lanes, one of the largest swimming pools I've seen.  Entrance fee is $2 and they offer monthly passes.  Make sure to check schedules as only two lanes remain open when swimming lessons and practice take place (80% of the time).  Otherwise it is a really amazing facility and a real pleasure to swim laps in.  Lifeguards are very friendly and professional.  I'm not 100% sure but I think it's salted water, not chlorinated.  If you live in Vegas or on an extended visit, and you are a semi-serious swimmer, you must give it a try.
