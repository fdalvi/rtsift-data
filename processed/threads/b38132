4 This is a lovely little antique store tucked away in a small strip mall right beside Lollypop Vintage.  It has quite a bit of higher end jewelry if you are looking for a really nice piece for a special occasion.  The owner is knowledgeable, very courteous and will consider buying antique or pre-1945 items, which I listed in one of the photos. Limited hours... but definitely worth a look.
5 What a great little antique store in Phoenix, AZ.  One of the first things that I noticed about this little shop is that IT SMELLS GOOD!!!  The place is clean and well kept - not like many of the typical antique shops.  Kudos to the owner, Gary for maintaining such a pleasurable shop!  The shop is filled with tons of goodies - raning from turquoise jewelry, lamps, period-era memorabilia, photos, etc.  While in Phoenix, I visited over 15 antique shops, and this one took the cake!  Prices are reasonable, and the customer service is outstanding!  Very pleasant to deal with and no pushy salespeople.  I went in looking for a turquoise cowboy belt buckle, and left with some snazzy Zuni Indian turquoise cufflinks.  SNAZZY!  Highly recommended!
1 Wish I would've gotten to see the inside.   I got here at 10:55 and the door sign said they opened at 11am so I waited. It was 11:05 still not open so I went to the antique shop across the street Xamelback Antiques (a lot of stuff, cool stuff). I spent about 30 minutes there then went back to Picture The Past now it's 11:42 and still not open. I tried opening the door and the young man inside just stared at me so I walked away and left.
