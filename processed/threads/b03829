5 I am a snowbird & found this spa for my nails, pedicures & waxing.  It is great that every year we come down the same people are there & they are the friendliest staff.  You can also get the best pedicures & you know that they are good because the same people are there all the time.  As a snowbird it is nice to know that you can get the same quality every year.
3 I bought my mother and sister certificates for a manicure and pedicure for Christmas.  I went with my mother for her manicure and pedicure and decided to get a manicure for myself while I was waiting.  Well you would have thought I asked to try on a dress!  They acted as if getting a manicure wasn't allowed for a man.  I would have given them 4 stars if they didn't make me feel a little self conscious about wanting to get a manicure while waiting for my mom.  Strange way to run a business.
5 They did an absolutely excellent job with my nails - fixing what another nail salon down the street had ruined. They're so very nice and personable, also! I left there with such a good feeling. I highly recommend them over any other nail place in Fountain Hills!! :)
