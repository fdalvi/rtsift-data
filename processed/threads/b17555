5 This is technically just for the website since I've never been to AZ. They supposedly have a regular retail store.   Anyway, the website is very easy to navigate and has a great look to it. I was searching for some inexpensive Juicy Couture items (esp. for pets) and I stumbled across this place. It's run by MLB players' wives. In any case, the website is well-done in the sense that it updates immediately. I bought the last JC collar set and when I checked back later, it was already off the site. This minimizes the need to contact someone back saying that the item is out-of-stock.   I opted for regular shipping, which came out to $4.95 for my order (that's cheaper than most shippers on eBay which is where I was also looking for JC stuff) and it was UPS ground. I ordered around 12 on Tuesday, it arrived Friday. Yes! My order even came wrapped with pink tissue. My JC dog tee had a tag, the collar set did not. The items are a bit outdated, from probably a 2006 collection but whatever.  I would order again from them. In fact, I'm debating if I want to order the other two tees. A tiny bit too big, but you can't been the major markdown.
5 Received the most beautiful basket of items for the birth of my daughter!  The presentation alone made me not want to open it up!  Products are high quality, and the basket was shipped with care.  We loved it, and were floored when we opened up the box from UPS.  5 stars all the way!
