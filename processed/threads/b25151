4 Small, but has everything you need to print, copy, or ship. Extra star for friendly customer greeting staff.
4 Had to print a couple resumes, the woman working was extremely nice and super helpful w/ additional questions I had about other printing services
5 No complaints. Employees were very polite and helpful.  Very clean. Of course a little expensive i.e. 10Â¢ for one copy b/w.
