1 OMG, I'm so glad I am not the only one that had the most terrible service with this company. They are so rude and unprofessional. I was in one of their estate sale and when I wanted to pay for 2 purses I found, I asked her if she would take ONE dollar off the purchase, she I guess Kathy, responded in the most discourteous behavior : "NO, And I am not even adding taxes with that" ....Are you kidding me? By the way all the items were way overpriced!!!. Do not hire these people they have the worst manners I've ever seen in a estate sale or a garage sale. Just like the other review, I won't be attending to any of their sales again.  EVER.
5 I have to disagree with all the critics. We have been going to estate sales for years and Kathy's is one that we always attend. They are not rude, they are very friendly and we enjoy the fact that there are NO CHILDREN allowed. I would be glad of that fact esp if I were the owner of the property. The children we have encounted at these sales are usually unsupervised and allowed to run around the place like a play ground. And as far as asking if they would take a lessor amount on a price....these are NOT garage sales. If you want to bargain, I suggest you follow the garage sales where you can offer $1.00 for an item.
