3 This place is extremely packed everytime I visit this location. Since it's located across the street from The Palms, no wonder it's always busy. The only concern I have is the panhandler(s) loitering in the parking lot. When I go to this location in the evening, they make me very uncomfortable. When you shoo them away, some can become verbally aggressive.
5 The Chevron station here is cheaper than anything that I have seen in California...by at least  20 cents a gallon.  If you are about to leave Las Vegas, or just need cheap gas, this is a great place to go.
3 We took our truck here to be smogged and we were in and out in no time. The price is average and they get the job done fast! The service is pleasant and they have a full staff of mechanics to prevent delays.
4 terrible had always been the place to go for me. I love the free car wash after my oil change.  I love that they are really quick with all my services. I usually go right before work since it is right across the street. makes it simple for me. I also like seeing the same manager when I go and they actually remember me and ask me how my job is going and when they can come in for a discount. :) I like that. makes me happy and feel like I can always go back. only thing that sucks is when I have to drive my own car out because they don't know how to drive stick and also when they don't have my air filter.. but still 4 stars!
