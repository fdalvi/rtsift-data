5 Very very impressed with the over all service I received from this Grooming experience for my dog!   I expressed my dislike for PetsMart grooming due to the fact that my pet is often there 5-8 hours past the time I was scheduled for - they listened.  First of all this place is very clean, simple, and organized.  The staff is friendly and attentive and answered all my questions very patiently.  As I watched them groom other pets I had a sense that these people genuinely enjoyed their job.  I had a 10 a.m. appointment and my dog was ready for pick up before 12 noon.  I was extremely impressed by this.  My dog wasn't in distress, he smelled clean, looked fresh, and his haircut was the best I've ever seen.  Count me in for the long term!
5 We take our schnauzer and our long haired dachshund here, and they do an excellent job with both. Never had any complaints about service or quality of work in the 4 or so times we have gone there. Also, there is (or was?) a discount for school teachers. Prompt service, good  work, cheap prices. Not much else you can ask for. Easier to get an appointment in the summer when all the snowbirds have left with their sundry lap dogs.
4 We stopped in with our Dobie for a bath when passing through. They did a good job on our Bella.  They really care about their little customers.
