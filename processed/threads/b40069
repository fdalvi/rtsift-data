5 I highly recommend this company 24/7 AC.  "Junior" answered my call & was able to come out same day-  pretty much right away.  He had excellent communication- he let me know by txt when he was on his way  & then when he was 10 minutes away.  He was here about 20 minutes & fixed a very noisy A/C  (the "squirrel cage" was broken- a piece of the metal housing had fallen- the blower fan was rubbing against it). He suggested replacing the squirrel cage as he said it was going to continue to fall apart- he's going to get back to me with a quote- HE DIDN'T EVEN CHARGE ME FOR SERVICE CALL OR THE QUICK TEMPORARY FIX!  He suggested I find my purchase & install receipt (which is from another company) to see if the HVAC system & installation are still under warranty- in essence giving up the job if it's going to save me from paying for it.   So glad to know honest, good, folk like this still exist.  I will definitely this company anytime I need HVAC service.
1 Wish I could give no stars! They called yesterday  and said they are in the area would we like them to service the AC. We just had it done but were looking for a second opinion about what is wrong with our daughters room being so hot. They were scheduled to come today between 2-4. It is now 5:20 and still no call and no one has come. Glad I wasted my entire afternoon waiting for someone who never showed up. Guess I now know why they are cold calling looking for customers!
