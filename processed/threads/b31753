4 Wonderful selection of clothes, I always end up leaving with a couple cute things. I love the wide aisles and the spot for your kids to play while you shop!!This place does't "feel" like a consignment store, it's not too overstuffed like most.
4 Agree with Tara. Place doesn't feel like a used clothing store. Every item that I've purchased from them doesn't look super worn and many times, looks unused. Prices are hard to beat for what they offer, and the staff is very, very friendly.
4 The shop is very cute and clean. They have a little play area for the kiddos and are super patient and not annoyed by children, which being a kid's used clothing store is a great thing. My daughter kept taking the owner's mom plates of pretend food and she would pretend to eat it and chat with her which was really sweet and also allowed me to get the shopping done. Their prices are very good on most things and their selection of items is also very good. I can never go in without purchasing something. It is not overcrowded like some used stores and the owner is very particular about what she takes, so you know everything is clean and cute. Also she puts batteries in all of the toys so that you can test them (it's a nice perk to have new batteries in a toy so that my kids can play with them right away) also she sanitizes everything and washes everything before putting them out on the floor. It's just wonderful to be able to purchase something used and not have to rush home to clean it up before you can use it.  I've sold to them a few times and the process seemed easy enough and although I felt like she passed on a few great items I understand that she is buying on-trend items so she has to be picky.
4 CLOSED. So sad. Loved this place.
