5 I am a general residential contractor who has used many roofing companies in the past 15 years.  Today, I give all of my business to Diversified Roofing.  They provide quality products and workmanship at extremely competitive prices.  I won't compromise my clients by using any other roofer.
2 I called to get an estimate. A project manager came by and looked, but never sent an estimate or called me back. I wasn't in a hurry, so I didn't follow up immediately.  After a few weeks, I called him back and heard a message indicating that he was no longer with the company, so I left a message for his replacement. I eventually spoke with the new project manager, and he said he couldn't find any information. I asked if he could come and give an estimate, and he said he would call me back. He never did.  I called their main number and had a similar conversation. They said someone would get back to me, but nobody did.
1 They did a great job on my roof, the experience though was horrible. The salesman left my file in the office when he quit, the new manager found 17 files that some were already paid for. I called a few weeks later to say WTH and lets get my roof done. As an insurance guru I need to refer good companies. They did great work, their staff are irresponsible, unreliable, and not trustworthy. I hate giving bad reviews. It doesn't help anyone. The manager now in charge also doesn't return phone calls. I had a client in my office to send him a referral and he never called me back asking for the clients name or number.
