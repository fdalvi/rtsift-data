5 This place did a great job on my SUV....my car is 5 years old and it looked like new when it was done.  Full detail includes engine, undercarraige, shampoo seats, carpets, etc.....They do an awesome job.
2 Wish I had read reviews before working my tail off. Spent $8 to wash my car myself, and it's dirtier now than when I started. That's the outside.   Figured I'd hand towel it later.   Pulled into the vacuums. We've driven several long trips, and were in desperate need of a thorough cleaning. Took out everything (why do we carry so much stuff?), removed all the mats, tossed all the garbage, folded down the seats, and made sure all doors were open and nothing in the way of the vacuum.   Went to start the machine. "Tokens only." Ok, fine.   Went to the token machine. "Change only." Whatever. Change machine? Nope.   Went into the office, where the kid on the phone was too busy talking to acknowledge me (why is it that the same kids who can spend hours playing video games that require multitasking are completely incapable of doing two simple things at once in real life?) After his phone call, I told him I needed tokens. He referred me to the machine. I told him I didn't have cash. He got a panic-stricken look in his eyes, then picked up the phone and dialed out. Not sure what he was doing, but after 3 phone calls, I told him that I'd take my business elsewhere.   Went back to the car, packed everything back in, left $8 poorer with a still-dirty car.
1 This place and Bubbles Auto Spa appear to be the same place so just to recap, I paid for the $10 deluxe auto wash automatic car wash, and it left my car with water spots all over and hard water spots to boot, so bad I had to run my wipers just to see thru my windshield to drive home, completely defeating the purpose of washing my car. Such a waste of time and money. This place is crap.
