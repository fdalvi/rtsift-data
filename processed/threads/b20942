4 The Village Store is a handy little corner shop hosting everything you would need from a newsagents and a few more items thrown in too. I popped in for some crisps as I was feeling a little peckish, there was a great selection of crisps to choose from and the staff were very friendly too.   They often have offers advertised and this weeks is buy one free on large bottles of cola, bargain!
4 Despite it's location in a busy and often grubby part of a major city, I've always noticed the village store when I'm down Leith way, purely because the name of this little newsagent reminds me of Postman Pat.  That's all.
4 I must admit, I laughed out loud when I saw Gavin M's comparison to Postman Pat.  Like most 'lol' moments,it's funny cos it's true!!  It's a cute wee corner shop with anything and everytihng....well they don't have light bulbs. They should though.  The staff are beyond lovely and the shop itself is always reasonably clean. It's a great little corner shop.
