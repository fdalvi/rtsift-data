5 Very nice and pleased with our stay. Full accommodations, access to their gym, pool, movie theatre and clubhouse. The apartment suite had every thing imaginable to make your stay comfortable. We loved it and thank you.
5 We just signed our 3rd lease with Ashton Pointe and upgraded to a bigger apartment. We definitely love it here and have always had great interactions with the staff! The fitness center, pools, theater, and putting green are second to none. Definitely a recommended place to live. Keep in mind if you are looking that the pricing can change every day so stay in touch with the staff to get the best rate.
1 I completely agree with the other comments about it being a nightmare to leave.  They lure you in with great amenities and nice apartments (I have to admit it is nice while you are living there).  In the end however, all of the good times were tarnished with a bad leaving experience.  Exorbitant cleaning fees and beware that you have to give a 60 notice before you leave (not a 30 day notice like the rest of the renting world).  That's where they got us.  We not only had to pay for the extra time we didn't need, they raised the rent WAY up (hundreds of dollars more).  Outrageous, they don't care about you, but I guess that's what you should expect when you rent from a giant conglomerate (PB Bell).
