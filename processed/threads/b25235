5 I always take my vehicle here because they are all ASE certified and work well with my warranty company and they also help me out with prices. If you ask them about the coupon for an oil change, they give you that rate. I recommend these guys big time!
4 This repair shop has made some changes over the past year and has become a great place for car service and more importantly customer service.  The only draw back is this Fletcher's need another store across the street because they are extremely busy.  It is tough to get in.  Ask for Joey when you get there. He gets it!
1 Tried to up-sell us on service we didn't need when we went in for brakes (the brake job was fine, though).  Like dummies, we went back about 9 months later when our car overheated (can you blame us, it was RIGHT THERE and we didn't want to drive an overheating car).  They told us we needed a  new timing belt and a whole bunch of other stuff we knew was a load of crap b/c we had literally just had the timing belt and water pump replaced a few months ago.  Liars!  Had the car towed to our regular guy (inconvenient, because he's far away) but not after Fletcher's $89 fee to give us bogus info.  Wanna know what the problem really was?  A radiator hose that had come off.  C'mon Fletcher's, that's LOW.
