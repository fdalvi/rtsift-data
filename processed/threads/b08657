1 This Jack in the Box location has the worst service & food that I have found in the Phoenix metro area. Every time I have gone through the drive through there my order has either been wrong or inedible - how hard is it to make a taco without frying it into oblivion? The wait times are consistently more than 5 minutes...I think I will be spending that 5 minutes driving to another location, just to get the correct order & food that is properly prepared.
4 Quick, courteous and tasty, this Jack in the Crack delivers every time. Courtney at the drive through window is always pleasant and excited to provide the delicious goods, and with the best menu variety in the fast-food game, you can always find something to please the palate and the pocketbook. Never been disappointed going to this location and after yet another successful trip tonight, I doubt I ever will. Solid 4 stars, which ain't bad at all considering it is the restaurant known in the 90s for killing all those kids with E. Coli.
2 So, yesterday morning, I actually had a prego craving.  I was in the mood for a smoothie for breakfast.  My traditional early morning oatmeal or yogurt breakfast was not going to do.  Baby wanted something else.    I head on over to this Jack-in-the Box, which is close to work.  I pull up, order my strawberry banana smoothie, and am promptly told that the "machine is broken".  Uh...well that sucks!  I pull up to the window and the person tells me that the machine is leaking (at least I think that's what he said).  But would be about 10 minutes and it would be up and running.    Now knowing the smoothie issues I had this morning, I dont think that the machine was broken.  The product just wasnt ready yet.
5 Yes, I was craving a burger at 10 in the morning. I went to the McDonalds across the street first just becaused I was heading east. When the gentleman came over the intercom I could hear some snickering and laughter; that made me happy. I like people to enjoy their job. When I ordered a burger he told me they weren't serving lunch yet. I said "okay, thanks then" but as I drove past the window I felt stared at like "who wants a burger at 10am?" Young punk... I crossed the street, and at the JITB intercom I asked, "Can I get a burger right now?" The man responded, "You can have whatever you like." I ordered, and when I pulled up to the window was greeted by a genuine smile and he asked me. "How was your service today?" Awesome. I will never go back to McDonald's.
3 One of the better Jack in the Boxs I've been to.  Cool staff, okay drive through and the price is generally right whatever your budget.  I am just sorry they scrapped he eat and earn program.
2 Jack in the box is very similar to Burger King quality for probably a much cheaper price.  The fries, very much like BK, were actually delicious, but the burger was probably the worst fast food burger I've ever had.  There were also a few homeless people hanging out inside this restaurant and trying to hit us up for change.
3 One of my 'go to' spots for a quick lunch.  Most of the time I go through the drive thru, but I occasionally dine in.  The restaurant is very clean and has a lot of space.  If there's a long line at the drive thru, I recommend parking and going inside.  Some menu items I've had:  Big Cheeseburger, $1.59 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jack-in-the-box-scottsdale-3?select=nZV9TeQ-g5bqKvhE8nMNQg#nZV9TeQ-g5bqKvhE8nMNQg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jack-in-the-box-scottsdale-3?select=p5X4CNgPnwWYg1lXnX6UYg#p5X4CNgPnwWYg1lXnX6UYg  Ultimate Cheeseburger combo w/Med Curly Fries, $7.48 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jack-in-the-box-scottsdale-3?select=3lneHJ4Gr2nBP5CBu3z1cw#3lneHJ4Gr2nBP5CBu3z1cw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jack-in-the-box-scottsdale-3?select=kh1SBdDpTUmLDFbBOSCk2w#kh1SBdDpTUmLDFbBOSCk2w http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jack-in-the-box-scottsdale-3?select=t11vHdHwkpL7jNxqHKYcsA#t11vHdHwkpL7jNxqHKYcsA  Bonus Jack, $2.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jack-in-the-box-scottsdale-3?select=ygPG5tBTlWA48tt8gCL0pg#ygPG5tBTlWA48tt8gCL0pg  Taco http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jack-in-the-box-scottsdale-3?select=jIom11tDaKUrNONF7fALMA#jIom11tDaKUrNONF7fALMA  Chicken Nuggets, $2.50 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jack-in-the-box-scottsdale-3?select=nG8DF-7AZFpyybSdZREYOA#nG8DF-7AZFpyybSdZREYOA  Most of the time I order the Big Cheeseburger, which is only $1.59.  When I'm really hungry, I'll get the Ultimate Cheeseburger and Fries.  When they have the Bonus Jack available (it's a limited time specialty item), I'll order that.  It's fast food, so it's not a gourmet taste experience.  During one visit, it took them too long to make my order, so they decided to throw in a Taco for me as a bonus item...I think their Tacos are gross.  There was a homeless guy sitting in the restaurant taking a break from the summer heat, so I gave it to him....he was really appreciative of it.  Return Factor - 80%
4 Good place; however I just found out they got rid of the breakfast bowl. BRING IT BACK!!!!
1 Dec. 18th ordered 3 sourdough burgers all tasted like they were made 2 hrs prior to being bagged for us. $15.00. Use to go every now and then... Not again.
