5 Micheal Field, LEGENDARY butcher. This place is super old school. If I was a cow, I would feel privileged to have his knife cutting me in two.   The best thing about this place is the portion size, the steaks are bigger than your head and are cut so fine that fat is practically non existent. If you like cooking Italian meatballs come here and get your mince, it's light and fluffy tasting instead of the usual stodge.   Ask about where the meat came from as well, even if you don't care you'll still get a good story.
4 It's undoubtedly clear that the meats on offer here are higher quality than you might get elsewhere and whilst you do have to pay a little bit more for the privilege of enjoying these meats they remain good value for money.    The staff are also very friendly and will help you out if you are unsure what you want to buy which is always a great help.  In addition, there is a fishmongers a few doors down which simplifies things if you are after both meat and fish.  I do recommend it especially if you live in the Marchmont area.
5 I always think of getting meat from the butcher as special occasion thing. That really shouldn't be the case, for too many reasons to list. So instead, I'll tell you why you should go here.  It's very reasonably priced. A whole rib of beef (which I shared as a steak, like a caveman), was Â£9.50, which is extremely reasonable.  The meat was juicy and tender - one of the tastiest steaks I've ever had. The produce in Michael Field appears to be very high quality.  I'm a big fan of a personal service, something you'll never get with the droids working in the big supermarkets (Disclaimer: I'm not claiming the people are droids, I'm saying the ethos of large chain supermarkets is often fairly impersonal. Lawsuit averted). Michael Field is a very friendly, helpful man. It's little things like that that make you want to go again.
3 I didn't buy anything at this butchers in Marchmont, because having left dear mother at home, I'm still trying to come to terms with raw meat.  The service was really friendly, especially for someone who obviously had no intention of buying anything. Like many butchers in Edinburgh, meat isn't the ONLY thing one can buy over there. There're a variety of pasties and pies, which are apparently made in-house!  There is a fishmonger right next to it, so it's great if you'd like to get your raw meat and fish fix at the same.
