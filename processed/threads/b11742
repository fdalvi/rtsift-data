3 Don't know why it says closed, came for my rib eyes 4.49 a lb, luv when they have sales on ny or rib eyes steaks . The beef is choice grade maybe not on par w/ John mulls or costco but for the price, can't beat it . I also like  the seafood counter better then albertsons, for some reason all the albertsons fish counters smell.
5 Natalie at the meat counter is always a delight and Todd does a good job ordering items that are not typically carried (i.e. fresh Rhubarb). I was at Albertson's just up the street and was going to but two Salmon Filets for the BBQ recently, but unlike Smith's, they don't have skin-on filets (and cut to order, if you ask nicely). I actually put down the items I was going to buy and went back to Smith's - where I know I can get what I want. I like that Smith's still sends me coupons for the things I buy the most, and that the cashiers are always friendly and helpful.
2 I'm usually pretty happy. Except for the cashier who is all in your grocery business. Today I did a late night shopping and was disappointed I had to check myself and bag all my groceries.  The machine likes to give you a major hard time. Looking up vegetables was a pain! Call button is ignored!
5 The staff in the bakery rock! Thanks for all the wonderful cakes you make for us here at Las Vegas Dissemination Company. All the employees love the cakes you bake for us:) Yay! Great cake, staff, quality and reliability! Mary Irby Las Vegas
