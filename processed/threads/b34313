5 When my husband and I moved to Las Vegas, we were pretty ignorant about water systems.  We purchased an expensive non-sodium system which was terrible.  Because it was non-sodium, we had many problems such as our dishwasher not doing a good job, spotting on all hand washed dishes, silverware, glasses, etc.,  calcium scale buildup on our outdoor fountain, shower door and faucets and handles.  We were so disgusted.  On a lark, my husband and I stopped in to see what Ecowater Systems was all about.  The owners, Brian and Diane and salesman, William were so well informed and totally explained their system and the ins and outs of how it worked.  We fully understood the difference of what we had that didn't work and the Ecowater system -- how it worked and why it would work.  We were convinced it would do the job for us and on the spot, we bought the system.  We've had it a couple of months now.  All the problems we previously had are gone.    Brian, Diane and William have been in the water treatment business for many years and know what they are talking about.  We are thrilled with this system and thrilled with the way we were treated.  They not only have a great product -- they know  the meaning of service.
5 Excellent service. I was extremely pleased with Paul, Brian, and all of the staff here. Very knowledgeable and customer-focused.
5 This company is top notch. They really know what customer service means and it's not a bunch of hot air.
