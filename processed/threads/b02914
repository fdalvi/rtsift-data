4 Very sleek and a bit out of a place in this mall.  The design really through me for a loop. I'm used to such generic layouts at other stores.  However, this store reminded me of a Nike Store, but only one level.  Prices are a bit high for clothing, but you'll find a few items on sale.  The same goes for the sneakers.  Running shoes are displayed at the front of the store and lifestyle and basketball shoes are located in the rear.  That's about it...
5 Let's be realistic here, these stores all sell the same shoes, generally at the same price from the same suppliers.  The difference is, of course, atmosphere and customer service. Short story here. I had a coupon that was expired, and called to see if they would honor it. They said they couldn't due to their computer system, but the manager gave me a way to get a new one through their corporate line. I called, and a few minutes later I was all set up. They even offer in-store pickup for online orders.   Great job, Finish Line!
5 Ahmad is amazing ! Go to him if you need anything ! He's so nice and so helpful ! Five stars all the way, soley based on his amazing customer service ! :)
4 I called ahead of time for a particular shoe and they were able to find it. When I came in within 30 minutes the associate at finish line was very nice and courteous. He was helpful even though he had multiple customers. He made it a point to acknowledge me, so when I waited it wasn't without being noticed. He remembered the shoe I wanted and had great customer service with a quick and easy transaction.
2 Garbage. No selection and feels pretty cramped. I was in and out of here within a few minutes. Stick with Foot Locker. The pricing is the same wherever you go in person so why go somewhere with barely any shoes. They don't use their space very well in this store.
