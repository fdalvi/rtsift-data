5 A great place to stop for fuel or quick convenience items. Great prices on items in the store, lots of gas pumps to help during the busy times
5 This gas station  is exacty as I expected. It is easy to get to from both North and South Dessert Inn and it never has a HUGE line.
1 It's a gas station. Nothing special. The pumps look pretty disgusting. The glass was too scratched up to see the numbers. The entire place looks like it needs a good cleaning.
4 This gas station/mini mart is very convenient. I don't buy gas here the prices are always high. Maybe because it's on a major intersection, S. Decatur & Desert Inn. They stay on deck with my favorite cigarillos. Swisher Sweets Plain. I can usually get my 24oz. Bottles of my favorite cerveza Corona 2/$5. They have sandwiches also. Don't forget the slot machines lol.
