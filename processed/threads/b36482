4 I often stop for breakfasrt and find the morning crew friendly and helpful, plus they get my order right.  It's nice to curtesy service from a fast food resturaunt.
5 This isn't five stars because Burger King is some amazing gourmet experience. However, this Burger King of all Burger Kings is 5 stars. This is one of the cleanest fast food places I have ever been inside. Also, the manager is the nicest guy and gives the best service. Seriously. I have been to fancy pantsy restaurants and not received such outstanding treatment. So don't laugh, not until you've been and know what I'm talking about.
1 This was the worst BK I have ever been too!  I was ignored and the food sat for a long while before the counter person put it on the tray and then had to pack it in a bag because I ordered it to go!  I was so disappointed!
4 I work nearby and have nothing negative to say about this location. They don't screw up your order which is always nice (ordering in or at the drive-thru). The staff is polite and unlike a lot of places no one is yelling or cursing at each other. Loses a star because it could you use a little facelift.
4 My experience was for the drive thru....  The exterior of this location was nice and neat which includes the drive thru area. Yesterday, I had to make a quick run before a meeting. I drove up and was able to place my order right away. The gentleman working the cashier area was friendly as he repeated my order back to me. When I drove up my food was hot and ready. Everything was great. Matter of fact I will return when I am in the area.
