5 Poof, you're chicken. Snap snap, now you're a duck. Clap clap you're a horse. Funny right?  Luke is more than that, a cure for phobias and habits that need to be broken. And then he can show you how he bends a quarter with his mind. He has a great magic gift for close-up or even a big group. Call him, wait he already knows you're going to call, but this Yelp filter makes it hard.
5 I have contracted Luke to perform strolling magic at several events that I have catered. He is brilliant. Later in the evening he can hypnotize willing participates on the spot!  In addition, he is dedicated and passionate hypnotherapist. If you know anyone struggling to quit smoking, lose weight, stop a habit such as biting their fingernails, or even a person that wants to be a better golfer... have them call Luke!
5 We recently booked Luke to come perform at one of our work functions and he was such a big hit that we brought him back the following week for another event.  Luke began entertaining our guests the moment he entered the door without any direction or introduction.  His friendly demeanor and natural charm added a special element to our work event.    We look forward to working with Luke in the future and would recommend him to anyone who is looking to add an unique entertainer to their event!
