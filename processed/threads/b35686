5 If you need a loan Tim is your man! He was fast, within 2 days I had my approval for $30.000 more than another lender had qualify me few weeks back! He was also able to approve me for a conventional loan, with 5% down, when nobody in town could... Yes good news if you need a loan!  Go see Tim! Tell him I said 'Hi' and looking forward to find me a home! Good luck!
1 This company has so many bad reviews on and off the Internet! My friend went thru hell trying to get a house using All Western Mortgage. It was either having to keep resending same papers over and over or simply just given the run around on the phone all the time. Definitely a no -no in my book and I will spread the word!
5 Matt Mauzy is an amazing loan specialist. He does a great job, and is the best at staying in contact.  Thank you Matt for all of your help.  Sarah and Jeff
1 I just moved to Vegas and looking to purchase a home.  I was assured that it will not be a problem even though I was told by the other brokerage firm that I need a full time position in Vegas for at least a month before I can qualify for a home when I checked into it last year.  They assured us that it was not a problem.  I didn't want another hard credit ding on my credit score.  I got a hard ding with no loan.
