5 Dr. Wirig is a wonderful Orthodontist!  I have had braces three times and my experience with Dr. Wirig was the best.  His staff is very friendly and professional.  I will definitely be taking my 4 children to him for braces.
5 Dr. Wirig and his staff are wonderful!  We took our three kids there for a consult and they loved it so much now none of them can wait to get their braces!  ;-)  They had a fun scavenger hunt and the Dr. and staff made them all feel like they were VIP's while we were there.  Looking forward to going back!
5 Such an amazing group of staff! The 2 Ortho's, Ortho Assistants, Treatment Coordinator and Front Desk - they are all fantastic. I definitely would recommend anyone looking to get braces to go to Wirig Orthodontics!
