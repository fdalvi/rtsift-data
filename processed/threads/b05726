5 2 years in and I still love these guys...prompt, admit when and if a mistake was made (just one so far) and just plain good folks. Highly Recommend!
5 Super friendly and great service - took 3 vintage Hawaiian shirts to be laundered & 1 to be pressed and it was just over $10...most excellent!
4 I have been coming here for the last month since the good dry cleaner by my house shut down. This place is inexpensive and does a fine job.   Today I dropped off:  two dress shirts; and  one pair of pants.   Total for dry cleaning $9.50.   They will be ready Monday afternoon, this is typical of this dry cleaner's 3 day turnover rate.   When you receive your shirts they are neatly pressed with a plastic tab attached to the crossed arms.   No complaints!
5 Friendly, quick & great service. Smiling faces & excellent work will get 5 stars from me every time!
