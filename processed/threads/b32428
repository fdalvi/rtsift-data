5 This is a great store to shop at with a very helpful sales team. I was visiting from Chicago when I stopped this wonderful store!  Everyone I worked with was great and very helpful with a smile.  Wish there was a store in Chicago!
4 $90 for my 2 year old's jeans...  $50 for my 2 year old's t shirt....  Exchanged them both in (gift : wrong size) for a $200 outfit.  I think I am in the wrong store....WTF is this real life?? lol  The only clothes Soul will own for years, that I will feel obligated to dry clean and press LOL
