4 My company has sent a few projects over to the people at Laser Creations, and it's been a great experience each time. They are very helpful, amazing to work with, and their pricing is competitive.  We have found them to be very dependable, professional, and reliable. A great business to work with. I will likely change this review to 5 stars once I have worked more with them.
5 These guys are awesome! I found them from the Arizona Trade Exchange, and have been a pleasure to work with with the couple of jobs I did with them. I hope to be working with them too when I get my taxi business up and running.   I always deal with Jen and she handles everything. They can handle just about any printing request I need and the work they put out is so professional. Their most recent job for me was a self standing banner for a home show and I was shocked myself with how good my graphic design came out.   If you are looking for a printing company in the area, I would highly recommend these guys. I think they save on overhead too by having their location off the main road which means savings passed on to the customer because they do have some of the best prices in the valley for printing shops.
5 Laser Creations has done a great job on a number of banners that we have created over the years... Woody is always easy to work with!!!!
5 Ridiculously good service.   I somehow managed to flub up A piece of art that I sent them. I didn't realize until they had finished the job for me.   I went out there to get it reprinted, they did in the same day and didn't even charge me! This is how you create lifelong relationships with your clients.   I plan on using them in the future for my direct to garment projects.
