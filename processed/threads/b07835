5 Yo, their store is awesome!  That dude, Richard, is da bomb! He hooked it up hardcore, mos def!
1 This is the last sprint store I will ever go to even if I have to drive out of my way to go somewhere else. The people there are very unprofessional and don't know what their doing. I walked in just to pay a bill and I have all of workers there just looking around talking not wanting to help even tho there's a lot of people here. It took them a while just to let me know there was a machine in the back where I can pay my bill. I went over to pay it and it wouldn't accept my money so I went back in line for some help and I have the guy a 20 and I didn't get any change back he just added it to the account without asking me. Probably because he was too busy making jokes with his buddy. Won't be coming back here!
5 Jaryd is plain and simple - AWESOME!!!    Screen on my S3...replaced.  Screen cover - replaced.  Speaker - replaced.  Helped me pick out a case so if I drop my phone, it wont shatter again.    This Sprint repair store is honestly about 15 miles out of the way, but if I ever need any work done on my phone again...I'm coming to this store to have Jaryd work on it.
