5 Framing is kind of an art in itself, I never noticed until I watched the staff here work. Which kind of frame, which colour to mount it against, should you use bulletproof glass so your kids can't mess it up?  I'm told that they can frame something up for you in under and hour which is really impressive, and it's not that expensive (depends what you're framing really).  They also do a nice selection of prints and unique birthday cards too.
4 I have been to this shop on a couple of occasions not to actually frame anything but to browse through their selection of funky and individual cards. They are quite arty and certainly in my eyes beat the mainstream Edward Monkton etc.  I have had a look around the shop and you can tell that there is a huge variety in framing. They are always super friendly to me and don't mind the fact that  I am there for smaller business rather than frames.
4 I cant say I have ever needed anything framing myself, but I often just come in here for a browse to see what type of stuff they have. Framing it seems is a skill - something that we all think we can do, but we cant quite do it to the standards of the pro's. And yes, pictures do look better once they are mounted into one of the ast range of frames in this place.  You may be wondering then what it is I do in a frame shop if I dont have framing needs - well, I'm in the market for a print (I dont know what I want yet), and framers has quite a large selection of them, as well as of birthday cards etc.  Maybe one day I will find the print I want and then get the F-Team (a renigade team of Framers on the run from the law for crimes they didnt commit) to fix it up for me. If I can find them.
