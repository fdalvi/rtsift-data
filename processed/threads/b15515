2 Nice apartments, however the apartment had a problem with Roaches and the complex didn't believe me and it took 4 treatments before they were completely gone. I haven't had a problem in months, but they should have taken care of this when I told them which is before I moved in.  Pool is nice but too many kids. The clubhouse is nice.
1 Looking for an apartment for when my lease is up, after my conversation with the office I can say it will NOT be The Edge at Lyons Gate.  Very snotty pretentious attitude, apparently I was bothering him with my silly questions.  I have no interest in living somewhere that changes their rates on a DAILY basis.
1 I live here.  One star is generous.  The office staff is incompetent, unhelpful and snooty.  They nickel and dime the residents on: 1. water 2. garbage 3. pest control (yes, they really charge for spraying outside the apt, monthly) 4. billing (yep, they charge you to charge you, monthly.  $4.95 paper, .95 electronic) 5. force cable payment whether you want it or not 6. $50 for extra gate cards for minors  The office staff also told me it'd be $19.99/mo for internet, when it's actually double that through Century Link.  Additionally, if you want anything beyond basic cable, you'd better get it in the beginning, or it will cost you hundreds, unnessisarily.  But again, no one in the office informed us of that when it was relevant.  Finally, billing is done through the apt complex itself, Centruy Link (for cable) and Direct TV (also for cable).  Very confusing and you really will need a diagram to understand billing.  I don't like it. At all.    However, in fairness, I like the apartment itself, and hardly ever hear my neighbors, but do hear the cars on the street. Constantly.
