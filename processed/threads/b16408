4 Nice variety shop! Good place to get a bong or hooka! Cool selection of blown glass pipes and trinkets. Nominal selection of cigars and pipe tobacco, but they had my Kuba Kuba, so I was happy!
1 Worst shop ever!!! Overpriced!!! Bootleg products!!! Rude staff!!!  If I could give 0 stars I would.  These jokers will try to sell you bootleg synthetic urine...wonder if they actually pee in the bag themselves... I would check it before leaving the store, unless u don't really care whether or not u pass ur test.  Bottom line: this place is run by shysters and rip off artists. Steer clear!
3 I hit this place up as they are supposed to have a big selection of glassware and hookahs. They did, I was super impressed with the volume of stuff they had crammed into this place. Prices were reasonable and overall a good place to get hookahs and glassware!
