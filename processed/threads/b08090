3 I'm visiting Mesa from Denver and I'm burning up. Craving cold ice tea I came to Walgreens.  Bought it. And left feeling accomplished
3 Walgreens is Walgreens.  This location is a bit sketchy depending on the time of day you go.   I have had people ask me for money outside and the parking lot is always very busy.  However, the staff is way helpful!  I was looking for travel size contact solution.  They pointed me in the right direction then had someone check on me to make sure that I found what I needed.  Good thing too because I would have left not seeing it.   I even got rung up in the cosmetic isle!
3 Decent location in what I would consider the not so fabulous section of Mesa. The lady at the counter was super friendly and I was in and out in no time with my $.69 Gatorade Peace A town, I'm out of here!
