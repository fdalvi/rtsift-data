5 My daughter has been attending this school for 3 1/2 years and she has thrived in this environment.  The class sizes are small and the teachers are outstanding at getting to know EACH child and working with them on an individual basis.  We love the small, school environment and the feeling of community that we feel at Bethany Christian School.  The academics are much higher level than other schools we looked at and students are put into skill based groups so they can excel and exceed on their own time frame.
5 We've been at BCS going on 5 years. We've got 3 kids at BCS and they all really love their school. The staff and teachers are amazing.  We appreciate the smaller classrooms and the great "community" it fosters. We've been so blessed to have our kids at Bethany through the provision of ACSTO scholarship monies. We highly recommend Bethany Christian School whether you're looking for a middle school or elementary. All around, it's an A+ school in our book!!!
5 My son is just about to finish his first year here and we couldn't be happier.  They have lots of activities throughout the year and I can tell he has learned a lot.  We are looking forward to 7 more years here.  The church next door (Sun Valley Community Church) is really great too.
