2 Any chip shop can be a hit or a miss, depending on when you go in but this chippy is genrally OK although they are very skimpy on the chips...
4 I only ever have the Haddock and chips here so cannot comment on the other food but the fish suppers are consistently excellent. The batter is never greasy and the chips are always well cooked.  The queuing system can seem a bit random as it is not always clear who is still waiting to place an order and who is waiting for their order to be made up. Staff are always polite and efficient. Consistently good.
