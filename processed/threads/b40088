5 Had a meeting downtown and swung in, in a pinch, hoping to get trimmed up in a hurry. Was greeted at the door by Stanly with a firm handshake and smile. The sent of talc and aftershave immediately reminded me of the barbershop experience I enjoyed as a child with my dad. Chair was open so we got right to it. Stan knew exactly what I was looking for before I finished telling him and went to town. Fast forward 20 min and I was lookin my best again. Great conversation, sharp haircut, awesome personality all at a bargain of 15 bucks. Will deffanetly return!
5 I'm glad and relieved to meet a barber who takes results seriously! Stanley is obviously very concerned about detail and providing the cut you want. He also adds in all the great touches, all the way down to the hot towel over the head with a quick shoulder massage at the end. His conversation and friendliness are a welcome addition to the great service. My new barber!
5 Being new to town picking a new Barber Shop was a big deal. I was referred to Biltmore Barber Shop by a friend and I've been coming here for months. Friendly service and great prices!
5 Stanley has been cutting my hair for many years and I have followed him with each of his moves. I'm happy that he finely owns his own shop.  Most shops today rush you thru so they can get to the next customers hair cut. Not Stanley, each cut is done to perfection. In the hundreds of haircuts I have received from him over the years I have never found any stray hairs or unevenness. He is a true professional!
