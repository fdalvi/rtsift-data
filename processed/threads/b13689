5 As a business person it's important to look good, and when you look good you feel good. Christine is a master at making you look and feel good. It's not that often you come across someone who actually takes the time to listen and understand what your desires are. I would recommend The Barber Shoppe without hesitation to anyone.
5 What a find! Barber shop for the men and a mini spa for the ladies. Bob is out front dealing with the boys, and Chris co owner, is in back with the ladies.  I can honestly say, this is the best shampoo in the valley. Magic fingers!! Unlike, big, busy, loud salons, when you are in the chair you feel like you are the only customer that matters, and Chris divides all her time to you.  She also teaches styling, so to say she knows her stuff is an understatement.  I have natural curly hair , not the easiest to cut, but Chris makes it look easy. Pedicures, coloring, are also available. So make a date, as in double date and relax and get pampered !
5 Ladies, don't let the name fool you! If you want a wonderful haircut, color, mani or pedi, than the Barber Shoppe is for you. The back room is cozy and  it is a one on one feel special kind of place. Only go if you want great results and want to be pampered.
5 I have lived in Fountain Hills for over 20 plus years and I absolutely love the Barber Shoppe!!!!  Bob is a superb barber and has pleased even the most picky of customers; my husband.  He has always done his own hair (even in the Marines) because he didn't think anyone could get it to his liking.  Bob proved him wrong!!!  I get my hair cut, colored and styled by Chris, who is a master with colors and cut!  Plus, she gives the most amazing pedicures and manicures.  Always precise and intensely focused on getting the cut, color and polish just perfect!  I recommend this place to everyone!
