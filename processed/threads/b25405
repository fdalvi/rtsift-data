5 I love getting my hair done here. Although it's a bit of a drive, I prefer coming here over any other salon in the area.  Amanda always does my hair and makes me feel important while she's doing it. We have great conversations and laugh a lot. That's always a good thing.  She's very talented and extremely professional when I sit in that chair.  Haircuts are very reasonable and on occasion there will be a discount offered on your next cut at the bottom of the receipt.  If you want a great experience and a wonderful hair cut, check them out the next time you are in the area. I think you'll enjoy it.
5 This was my first time here, and I had a great experience. Trisha did an awesome job with my husbands hair. He is actually really picky with who does his hair so he was a little skeptical of a chain salon. We were really happy with the results, I would highly recommend!
4 Wait time is not very long. A few times I have gone in and it was a terrible experience. My hair turned out bad, and the hair dresser was extremely rude, and I was burnt with a hair dryer. I don't remember her name. Terry had saved that place for me, and now when I go, I will only ask for Terry. She's such a sweet lady who does a very good job and DOESN'T BURN YOU WITH A BLOW DRYER.
5 I've been going only here for haircuts since my arrival in AZ in 2009.  I lucked out and got Terry my first time into the store and she has cut my hair ever since!  Great and talented technician who really knows hair and has a following, so make sure to ask for her when you arrive.  I check in online with their phone app and then am 'next in line' for Terry when I get there.  She's terrific and I'd follow her wherever she goes.
