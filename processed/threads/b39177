5 I love this gym! What a great concept. Not too big or too small, equipment is all new and there's no waiting like some of the other over packed gyms. Very clean inside!  I also love that they have classes like Zumba and kick boxing and even a spa in the back of the gym. It's definitely different than most of the gyms in Vegas and worth checking out. Oh I forgot to mention there's a juice and smoothie bar opening in the gym.
5 Love this place! They have a brand new equipment, fun classes, a spa and an awesome smoothie bar that also offers healthy food plans and prepared fresh meals! I started a 5 weeks to fitness at the gym and lost 11 pounds in my first week! Dave's food is so yummy and I have an awesome personal trainer (Brandon). I feel like I'm finally on my way to a new healthy me and couldn't do it without all these guys at Body Focus Fitness! I just want to say thanks!!
3 This place is great. Has everything a heavy lifter like me needs. And they don't mind when I slam the weights. They have a spa and tanning stuff. Great Zumba even though I don't do that. But one major issue. COCKROACHES. They are everywhere..
