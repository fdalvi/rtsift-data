4 This is a well stocked charity shop with a good range of bric-a-brac and all for a good cause, of course.  I particularly like browsing through the book sections in charity shops and they had a whole section called "Old and Interesting" with some pretty old school books including old film reviews which I thought was pretty cool.  The staff here are friendly and on my visit they were busy working away organising new stock onto the shelves.  They also have a section with brand new items including gardening accessories such as cool watering cans and gloves. They also had a box of rubber ducks for £1.99 a pop.
4 Whilst I certainly advocate the cause for Save The Children, I must say that on a visit there earlier this week it managed to add further weight to my argument that Edinburgh can be quite a perverted city.  the lacy corset in the window looked far more apt for a seedy burlesque show at best, a street walker down Leith Docks at worst. In fairness everything else inside was pretty much your usual charity shop standard, but such an item was far from what I expected to see in Save The Children's window. I'm quite old fashioned and think such a store should stock comfy, moth-eaten old cardigans and threadbare cuddly toys.  It's all for charity though, so shouldn't complain.
4 This is possibly the cheapest of the central charity shops especially if you are looking for books.  Even the best books which you won't find anywhere else for less than about £3 will be found here at £1.50 if you are lucky enough to stumble upon them.  However, due to the cheapness of these items the stock moves fairly quickly so a one off visit is not always very successful.  The bric-a-brac section is also very good with a selection of kitchen appliances usually available.  These are very tempting at the prices and I did have to stop myself from buying a second kettle.  All in this shop is cheap, but this does mean that the best items don't spend long in the shop.
