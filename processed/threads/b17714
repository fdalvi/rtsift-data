5 I visited this place when it was Bada Boom and totally dug the space then. Now it seems even more perfect as a sports bar.  The space is laid out well and roomy. The bar is big and seems easy enough to get a drink. The booths are great! I am a sucker for a good booth- these are comfy and have own TV.  I had buffallo chicken and it was really good. It's nice to have bar food but not feel like your in some dumpy hole. Good spot for watching the game or hanging out with a big group.
2 I agree this place kind of sucks.  Food is average. and although it looks really nice no one ever seems to be there.  It is always dead.  they have great TV's and I think the place should hop but instead it is not.  Go to tanked fish next door. everyone else does.  This place looks really good and I like the bar set up. reason for 2 stars.
1 The food here was gross. Our waitress was clueless. I don't think they actually cook anything here. They must just have a micro to nuke whatever frozen stuff they buy. Will never come back here. Came here with my boyfriend, his sister and her 2 kids and no one had a meal they liked. Not even the chicken tenders or hamburgers. Stay away!
