1 1 star from the vegan perspective, as they use whey (an animal protein) in most of their breads, including their white and wheat sub breads. Please drop the whey (and all other animal products) from your breads!
5 I eat at a restaurant in Cave Creek weekly. I like the buns they use on burgers and chicken sandwiches so much, I asked where they get them. It's Capistrano's. They are the bomb. To give them one star because you're a vegan, is like me giving a vegan store one star because I eat meat.
1 We had a meeting scheduled for Capistrano's to supply our restaurant with bread and buns.  We waited over a half an hour before deciding we would need to reschedule.  Later, after we left, the gentleman we had a meeting with called us.   Instead of apologizing for wasting our time, he proceeded to blame us for being late when we were 5 minutes early!  After that failed, he tried to blame the receptionist who tried at least 3 times to call his office, twice on his cell phone, and even sent him and E-mail!  Apparently, Capistrano's has all the customers it needs and isn't really looking for more.  Take your business elsewhere.
