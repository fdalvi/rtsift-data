5 I have been seeing Dr. Sue since 1996 now.  My initial reason for seeking her out were the severe reoccurring sinus infections I was having.  I had never considered acupuncture before (and knew little about it) but my traditional doctors were suggesting I take antibiotics for 3+ months and then surgery.  There was no way I wanted to do that and felt there had to be another option.    Dr. Sue set up a course of treatment for the sinus issue and once it was under control I reduced the frequency of my visits and went once a month or so for what I call "tune ups".  In the past 14 years, I have had a few colds BUT, only two actual sinus infections as compared to 3 & 4 times a year before!!   Dr. Sue is also amazing at Craniosacral therapy and has done wonders for my back & neck pain using that, acupuncture and massage.    In addition to her 'people practice', she also provides canine acupuncture and therapeutic massage.
5 I have visited Dr. Sue for several issues and she is amazing.  Whether it is just some pain to relieve using acupuncture to a serious medical issue I was having, she remedied them all!
5 My wife and I have been going to Dr Sue for more than a year for weight loss and to get healthy. We have both had excellent results working with her. Dr Sue's weight loss programs are tailored to the individual person and she leaves you with the tools to maintain your health and well being. She is very caring,  compassionate and is a great accountability partner. We recommend her to anyone looking to get and stay healthy.
