3 Only popped in for a quick pint just before they called last orders but the range on offer seemed good, service was friendly and the feeling overall was one of it being a decent pub frequented by a local clientele. Worth making the trip to the eastern edge of town for.
4 Perfect size place with enough tables and chairs to not be too crowded.  Lot's of TVs for watching the games, no background music, staff was attentive.  Take a sign only credit card which is really nice for business trips... they have an average array of brews on tap, I didn't see any of the smaller brewery beers available.
