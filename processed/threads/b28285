5 The Gardener's Kitchen is a fantastic little local company that sells scratch made, slow cooked, ready-to-bake meals in a number of  phoenix farmers markets and specialty food stores.  The offerings include meat dishes, pastas and even vegetarian and vegan dishes.  Every meal is expertly made by hand in small batches with no chemicals or preservatives and takes full advantage of the bounty of the local farmers markets.  They are delicious!  In the interest of full disclosure I must mention that the owner and operator of The Gardener's Kitchen is my sister.  This however, gives me unique insight into the food produced by The Gardeners Kitchen.  I grew up eating the food my sister cooked and it was always fantastic.  She is one of my foodie inspirations.  The most amazing thing about what she has done with the Gardener's Kitchen is that the frozen food tastes exactly like her fresh made meals and they take no longer than an hour to prepare.  Anyone who lives in the greater phoenix area would be well advised to stock up on some meals from the Gardener's Kitchen for those nights you want foodie quality food without any fuss.  The Gardener's Kitchen sells at the following farmers markets: Downtown Phoenix Public Market 721 S Central Ave Phoenix, AZ 85004 Saturdays 8am - 1pm  Tempe Farmer's Market 805 South Farmer Avenue Tempe, AZ 85281-5536 Monday - Friday 11am - 7pm Saturday 10am - 8pm Sunday 12pm - 6pm
5 I do not get to the Phoenix or Tempe Farmer's Markets very often as I live on the other side of the world but I did get to sample some of the dishes and have to say that they were outstanding.   Next time I happen to be on that side of town I will have to give it a second taste.
