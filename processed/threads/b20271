2 Really not great. I would probably go as to far to say the worst Indian restaurant I have ever eaten at, and I have been to some truly horrendous ones!   I came here last month with a couple of friends, against our better judgement as it was completely empty at about 7 in the evening, but we still dined here. The food was really not tasty, I had onion bhaji's to start which were dry and tasteless, and my friends had a selection of kebabs which they said were chewy, and they really looked unappealing. The curries were equally awful. I had the chicken bhuna, which had a super watery sauce, and the chicken was really chewy and stringy, and there was a layer of oil on the whole thing making it taste rank to be honest. The rice was also over cooked and was pretty soggy. To their credit though, the nan bread was tasty was was the best part of the meal - but it would be pretty difficult to mess that up!   The meal was really expensive too, with two courses coming to about Â£17 - really not worth it. I found the staff rude and unhelpful, and overall had a pretty nasty experience. Don't be fooled - just because a restaurant is on the Royal Mile does not mean it is good, I learnt the hard way!
4 I had a surprisingly good time here. I say surprisingly cause we wanted Indian and picked the closest place to the hotel. I thought it would be touristy and expensive and crap and it wasn't.   The food was better than good and it was reasonable enough prices. The food also came with this mint dipping sauce which was divine!   Next time I'm in Edinburgh I will definitely try and make it back.
