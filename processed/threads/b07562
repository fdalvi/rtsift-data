5 I used to work here!  I still am great friends with the owner.  Service, sales, or rentals, this is a Sunnyslope staple.  He even has a pawn license so he can even buy (and thus sell) used bikes.    He's an expert - I was always amazed at the depth and breadth of his knowledge when I was working here, but maybe that's cause I was 16 and a total bike n00b.  The selection of new bikes might be a little limited, but if you are in the market for a used bike or already have a bike that just needs a little TLC, check this place out.
5 I swung by after the recent YVE b/c I haven't been here for a few years - amazing how things look the same after all this time.  The reason I did an update is because I wanted to note that this place has a pretty wide selection of new bikes - not a ton of high-end new stuff, although he can special order something in if you want to support your local small business.  He does have quite a variety of sizes and models of, shall we say, more accessible mountain bikes, cruisers, crossover bikes which are like mountain bikes but more for on-road riding, and so on.
5 Good old fashioned  bike shop. You cant beat it.  Can fix just about anything on a bike.
5 I'm ashamed to share that my 10-year old bike still has the hair on the tires, AND the tires were flat from having been in my storage shed for 6 years. Figured it was a good idea to get a tune up (and a helmet) before trying to ride again!   The shop owner was so nice! $40 for the tune up and even though it was going to be ready later that day, he advised I leave it a bit to make sure the tires didn't need a new tube (they didn't).   He patiently showed me how to put the bike rack on my car - even though I didn't buy it from him, I just brought it from home.   He didn't try to sell me the most expensive option of the accessories and in the end, I got a tune up, a helmet, a bike lock and a headlight for $128 (including tax).   He taught me about the gears on my bike and gave me a map of all the bike paths in Phoenix! All the while, charming banter. I feel like I've made a new friend!   Not only can you buy bicycles and any accessory you may need for your bike at this little shop on Hatcher Road, I understand you can rent bikes here too; and, the shop is right by the canal so if you don't already own a bike but feel like riding, this would be a great launching point.   Of course, I SAY that... let's see if I actually get on mine now...
4 Found thrift store 10-speed that needed some tightening & tuning before giving to a friend - tho couple other shops are closer - took it here based on reviews and very satisfied.  Courteous, competent, personable,  reasonably priced, and short turnaround.  Very happy with the service.
5 This is a GREAT bike shop.  My son has decided he loves to bike and so we went to 3 bike shops before finding this gem.  Nice prices for an entry level biker (or a bike collector, great vitage bikes, or a serious biker might find something, but since we are new at this, well...that's all I can review).   The guy that worked there (not the owner) was sooo nice! He worked with my son on how to change gears and he hooked us up with a new seat.  After a weekend of more biking than I have done in 10 years, I am going to head back and get my son's bike fixed (he crashed), look into a bike helmut and a new bike for the hubby! :-)  I really liked this place!
5 Leon is nothing but 100% awesome!!  my dad bought his first bike from him 25years ago and now I shop their 25 years later.  best place in town to find vintage cruiser parts.
5 A Sunnyslope landmark and I am not exaggerating. This place has been here for as long as I can remember and the service has remained top notch. I have bought and sold a few bikes here over the years and have never been done wrong. Bought a bike today and was impressed with the fact that the guy didn't even try to up sell me at all. He gave me suggestions based off what I said I was looking for,let me try a few bikes out in the parking lot and when I chose my new ride proceeded to make adjustments to the handle bars and seat which magically made the bike fit me like a glove. This is truly a great place to buy a bike, support local businesses and honest businesses by buying here.
4 Great place we found an stopped the sad day I had to drop a goo d friend off at the human society across the street.  My wife was looking for a Pink Beach Cruiser an they ha the perfect bike. Like them so well I sold 10  year old Trek 720 Hybrid to a friend an found a nice gun metal mens beach cruiser for me.  Was a bit more than I wanted to spend at the time, but they are worth every penny  Great Honest guys, that even buy older bikes
5 The owner is a great guy, very friendly, takes time to explain things, and gives you what you need!   I bought a bike for my younger brother, which he rode around a bit, and decided he wanted something a little more rugged -- we brought it back (with a flat tire and slightly bent rim - whoops!) and the owner offered to swap it out for a comparable bike, helped my brother pick one, and adjusted the seat --- DID I MENTION THIS WAS ALL WITHIN 3 MINUTES OF CLOSING TIME!?  He stayed a little late to help us and then even recommended a restaurant close by (Wagon Wheel - figures, right?)   This area is shady, but the owner and the store is not!  5/5 all the way!  :)
5 My son had a flat and this place is close and my fellow Yelpers give it a five star rating. That is totally correct! The owner was friendly, polite and had us back on the road in like 3 minutes. Fair prices and a good selection of bikes, parts, etc. Highly recommended!
4 Very affordable bike tune-up, just don't expect your bike to be cleaned like other bike shops do.  I guess that's where the extra $10-15 goes for other places.  Bike technician was very friendly and fast.  Bike was ready in one day.  My wheels seem a bit wobbly, so I'm not sure he trued them or not.  Once again, another service that other more expensive tune-ups usually include at other shops.  This review is for the great, friendly service, not so much for the quality of the tune-up.
2 I see some great reviews here, but I have to say that I did not experience the friendliness here that others have.  I walked in with my son, with a couple bikes in the back of my truck to possibly sell.  I walked in and looked directly at the gentleman behind the counter and gave the obligatory nod, smile and hello.   the nod, the smile, and hello were NOT returned.  I inquired about possibly selling my bikes.  He didn't even look at them, and they were nicer than the used bikes i saw in the parking lot.  He immediately snapped back that HE WAS NOT BUYING BIKES RIGHT NOW.  okay buddy, relax,  i just asked.  There ARE USED BIKES IN FRONT, my bad dude!  I had a badly warped rim on my mountain bike.  I asked him about that, he said he could fix it.  I brought it in and he said it was shot.  I figured that and I purchased a rim from him.  Thought he was gonna replace it for me.  NO DICE.  He just handed me the rim and told me to have a nice day.  He OBVIOUSLY did not like me as a customer, so I guess I have no reason to go back.  Thanks alot buddy.  I'll buy my kid a brand new bike elsewhere, now that I've sold his gently used, but outgrown of Mongoose bicycle on craigslist.  I won't be buying the $240 Diamondback bicycle he saw in your shop, at your shop.  A little friendliness goes along way.  This seems pretty common in the bicycle shop world.
5 These guys were super friendly and honest and they didn't charge me an arm and a leg. I'm definitely going back.
5 OK, so my son destroyed another tire. Back to Try Me Bicycle Shop we go. Same exact experience. Great customer service (while you wait, I might add) and very fast. Prices are reasonable and it's in a good location. Easy in/out access. We'll be back I'm sure!
1 Unlike others, I did not find the owner friendly. I found him to be a bag of douche of galactic proportions.  I suppose this place is OK for average bikes needing average repairs, but when I brought in my road bike for a repair of moderate difficulty for any competent bike shop, because the owner was incapable of doing the repair he chose to insult me by telling me I should sell my bike and get something more appropriate for someone of my physique.   At the moment I'm a little overweight, but here's the facts: every summer I road bike in Italy. I have summited Mt. Terminillo. I have gone up and down the hills of Umbria as a member of a local riding club. I have ridden legs of various stages where the Giro d'Italia is run. I am capable of riding as much as 200 miles/week. I can summit South Mountain 3x in a go.  I have ridden literally thousands of miles on this very bicycle, which -while carbon fiber - is FAR from a pro racing model. But this nitwit thinks I should sell my road bike because it's "too advanced for me". Oh and I'm a fat motherhumper too, thanks and come back again soon!  "Try me"? I did. You and your sad little bike shop in the ghetto failed.  --- Edited to add: since my encounter with this obnoxious tool, I found a friendly bike shop which had no interest in fat-shaming me. I told the story about this dickwad and all of the employees were aghast. They fixed my bike wheel so that I could ride again. I'm doing 200 miles a week (yes really) and have dropped 7 lbs in 3 weeks. By August I should be under 200 lbs, and when I go to Italy to ride up Mt. Terminillo again I will take a selfie.
