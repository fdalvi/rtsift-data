5 Good people, great service. Been going there for a while now, and always going to Andrea. She's super cool and funny. Although busy on weekends, strip mall parking is aplenty, and if you happen to have a long wait, you can just hit Fry's next door to do some grocery shopping while you wait. Target and many other stores close by in this convenient location.
4 I have been going here for a while now and can't say anything bad about it.  The staff are always friendly and knowledgeable.  There aren't too many times when I have to wait very long to get my hair cut.  I have seen many stylists here and haven't had any bad experiences.  Very affordable as far as I am concerned.
5 Fast service, the woman who did my hair was great and it was the cheapest hair cut I've ever gotten. I was told that my hair cut looked better than when I was paying $200+
4 I've been coming here for years & it just dawned on me that I have never posted a review for it!  I sit with whichever stylist comes up when it's my turn, & I've always liked my haircut.  There usually isn't much of a wait, & if there is, you have a variety of stores to go do a little shopping at while you're waiting.  Regular haircut $12/$10 Sr. & occasional discount coupons in the mail.  Good place!     :-)
1 Why even bother checking in online?  It went from 5 mins to 15 min wait so I checked in and headed over. 10 minutes later when I got there, they told me it was going to be another 20 minutes and I was at the bottom of the list.  Checked in another day because it said 1 minute wait. I checked in and headed over. Was there about a minute later and it was packed. I was fourth on the list, and when I checked again it still shows a one minute wait time and there are six people on the list.   When will I learn?
