5 One of the better Fry's locations in my opinion, and the prices are really good to boot. Compared to some of the other Fry's locations, this one has always had really outstanding customer service; they are always willing to help you find something and are friendly at the checkouts.  The grocery has always been really clean and organized, and the home and garden section on the left adds a nice variety.  The parking lot can get a little cramped with the one-way lanes, but this is still my top choice in the area for a market.
1 Rosalie at customer service should probably watch what she says about customers of different cultures and races. People are always watching. Then to bash on that customer to another customer? Not so customer service Rosalie.
2 This is just a rounded-up 1.5 star rating because Jenny will not budge and meet me at two stars. Guess a tie goes to the business.  So little to say about the service at this Fry's. On our Saturday morning visit, there were customer lines EVERYWHERE. Customer service, check out, and even the Starbucks. But employees, of which there were many, were in pairs and threes having conversations on the middle of the floor including right at the entrance where entering patrons were forced to maneuver around carts and employees setting up oversized flower displays.
4 I like Fry's. clean stores, friendly locations, I think I'm getting wonderful prices. really like the fuel rewards!
5 I actually look forward to grocery shopping when coming to this location. This place has it all from food, to home decor, fuel for your vehicle, to outdoor items. It is Clean, has great produce and friendly employees.  Give this place a peek, you will be happy you did.
5 Manager Paul and his staff are the most friendly and caring employees in the Frys East Valley area. They always go over and beyond in customer service.
