3 First Visit - Waited in line for 15 minutes Hostess: Just want to let you know that we are out of pancake batter  Second Visit (the next morning, waited in line for 40 minutes) - Ordered the Dutch Baby (Oven baked. Served with whipped butter, lemon and powdered sugar.) Damn good pancake, but come on, how can the Original Pancake House be out of Pancakes???
4 My favorite breakfast place in LV / Henderson.  Located in GVR - Green Valley Ranch.  I have yet to experience the potato pancakes prepared like OPH, anywhere else.... Outstanding!
5 Their speciality is this baked Dutch Apple pancake that is fluffy huge and to die for.  All the portions are gigantic so we order different things and share. The oven baked omelets are also amazinging fluffy and filled with whatever you want.  Every kind of pnacake and toppings you can imagine. The Chocalate chip pancake comes with tiny chips sprinkled on top with confectioners sugar and whipped sweet cream. butter.  It's like eating the best fudge yet pancake style. Damn I can't wait to go there this Sunday.  It about 15 min.s south of Las Vegas and is inside a newly built casino called "Green Valley Ranch"  that is only a couple of years old. Take the fwy towards Mc Carren Aiport. You will see it from the fwy. There is another location in North Las Vegas on Charleston which has an old fashioned amibience and too many nosiy families.   It is always worth the wait and when we take someone for the first time they are really impressed with the food. All of these people who are complaining about the wait don't seem  to know that you can't rush good food made from scratch. It's not some crappy mix from a box like IHOP has. The eggs are real not liquid from  a carton. Baked items do take awhile so no surprises there.  Plus the place is very popular so expect to wait. The prices reflect the huge portions and the quality as they  carry or import the best butter, cheeses, canadian bacon etc.
4 Sure, there's a wait, but once you've eaten there you really understand why. I really love this place for breakfast. I'd give it 5 stars but I had a weird experience last Saturday. I ordered a strawberry Belgian waffle and a kids chocolate chip pancake. (Hey, be nice, I couldn't decide what I wanted and Mom said to get both so who am I to argue?) The waitress asked if I wanted whipped cream. Yes, I said, on both. She brought out the food but nothing had whipped cream on it. She realized and brought me a large side of it but it wasn't the same. The heat of the breads is supposed to melt it a little bit and make it moist but these were *seriously* dry. The strawberries were yummy but "dry" as well (which is fine-- they're not supposed to be wet-- but it didn't help the dry waffle/pancake problem.) It was a little weird smearing the cream on after the fact, but whatever.   The ham and cheese omelette my mom got was fantastic, as was the orange juice. She also said the coffee wasn't bad, for restaurant coffee. I wish they had skim/fatfree milk!!   Still I love this place!!
4 I was here with some awesome college loves and didn't know what to think of the place at first.  I mean, they were raving about how good it was but I didn't see how one pancake was better than another.  It's located inside Green Valley Ranch in the District, a little bit of a drive if you're coming from the West but nothing to complain about.  We had to wait, but it wasn't terribly long, and our waitress turned out to be a sweetheart.  I ordered pancakes with strawberries and whip on top.  When I got it, the strawberries looked so perfect I almost didn't want to eat them, almost.  Every one's plates looked incredibly delicious actually, and considering that no food was left uneaten, they must have been.  My mouth was so delighted by my choice it's still thanking me.  The whipped cream was more like vanilla icing which just made it that much better.  A breakfast dessert is basically what it was, if only every morning meal could be such a treat.
3 I've been here a number of times and have mostly had good service and good food. It's in a casino though... which makes it less appealing to me as a destination breakfast spot.  Portions are gi-normous. You could probably share a plate with a friend if you're feeling cheap. Coffee is decent but I like mine stronger.
3 My first OPH experience was here back in 2005. When my friend and I went we didn't have much of a wait. Tried the Dutch Baby and it is HUGE. Can't say I'm a big fan of that dish, I mean it's good and all but after eating a quarter of it you want something with a little bit more variety but hey that's just me.
4 Great breakfast place. It's been voted the best breakfast place for the past 4 years by the Best of Las Vegas. Pancakes are excellent, as well as the omelettes. I like how the omelettes come with 3 of their signature buttermilk pancakes too! I've had their specialty: Apple Pancake. A little sweet and huge, but still tasted great.
2 Drove out of our way to go here for a good breakfast, based on the good reviews I read about it on the net.  Was not impressed at all though;  the pancakes were decent, but the eggs and sausage I tried were mediocre.  I also was excited to try their 'signature' Apple Pancake as it sounded delicious, but I was greatly disappointed.   It was huge, but very blah, could barely taste any pancake at all really.  Didn't enjoy it much at all, and on top of that, everything was expensive considering it was just breakfast food, almost as much as we'd pay for a nice sit down dinner!
4 I can never finish my whole breakfast here!!   They usually have a wait early in the morning so get there as early as you can becoz they don't seat you til your whole party is there! I've tried their Santa Fe Omelette which comes with red/green salsa on top! It complements the omelette very well!  The omelettes also come with buttermilk pancakes! The portions are ridiculously large and for the money...its pretty worth it!  I enjoy coming here..especially when I feel like having carbcakes for breakfast!
2 Eating here was a disappointment compared to the other OPH locations I've eaten at, as well as my past experiences eating at Green Valley Ranch.   The restaurant feels cramped, with too many small tables in the open center of the room. A woman seated at the table behind mine banged her chair into mine by simply pulling it out to sit down. They seem to serve many families; the close seating must cause problems when kids get restless or fussy.  The food my party ordered was slow to arrive and no longer hot when it was brought to us. Other diners seemed to have the same 20-minute wait for their dishes, so we couldn't write this off as just a fault of our server. I ordered the Challah French Toast and found it to be a little dry in the center. If I had to eat here again I would choose something else.  Two stars for the large portions, the many choices on the all-breakfast menu, and the not quite standard 80s hits piped in. (Anyone playing "Video Killed The Radio Star" is on my good side.) But if I'm ever at GVR and in the mood for breakfast again I'll try their coffee shop instead.
5 Wow.  I'm salivating as I am typing this...  This place is just that good.  At least for breakfast.  Their OJ is freshy squeezed.  Portions are generous.  I had the Eggs Michael.  It's poached eggs with a mushroom sauce and potato pancakes.  The pancakes in my photo look burnt but it's good.  My friends had no complaints.  Their omelette's were insane and must have at least 6 eggs in there.  Don't be put off by the long line outside.  It moves quickly.  Our party of eleven was seated within 10 minutes once we got to the front of the line.
4 YUM-O to this place.  line was long my first time here but SOOO worth the wait!.  i had this tropical pancakes with pineapple and tropical syrup....while i dont regret my choice, i wish someone at my table would've ordered the dutch pancake...my goodness those were huge. only thing i would say is that for most items, you need to pay additional for the breakfast sides...too bad this isnt 24 hours!
4 A perfect place for good, clean, hangover curing, hearty breakfast.  I love the cherry crepes, chocolate chip pancakes and ham & cheese omelets. They go crazy with the cheese it's just oozing out of your omelet as soon as you cut into it.  I can never finish my food; it's just too big here.  Minus one star for service that isn't up to par.  I wish they have more fresh juices like apple.  Overall one of my favorite breakfast spots to hit when there isn't a line going all the way around the restaurant.
5 Good food for brunch! Their food is not greasy as other places. The strawberry whip cream waffles is the best. Their whip cream is very light and fluffy and not too sweet. The waffles itself have some kind of flavor to it and a little crunchy. I'd ordered the eggs and sausage. Both were not greasy. It is located on the highest floor of the parking. That's a pretty nifty idea where people can go straight to it from the parking. Love the strawberry whip cream waffles. Will definitely go back there again.
5 What economic slowdown? What recession?  This place was packed last Friday and I thought, coming from the Bay Area, that Las Vegas/Henderson was slower than San Francisco.  Wrong!  And I doubt that these people were going to the Rebel game the next day at the Silver Bowl.  Yes, the pancakes still take a while to get to the table, but excellent as always.  Service was quick and attentive.  The server and his manager were quick with coffee refills.  Yes, there were lots of families at this location.  Even the older folk were cramped into OPH.  A nice young couple gave me, the solo, tourist diner, a coupon good for 20% before I paid my bill.  Who says the residents of Henderson are rude and aloof?  Me thinks not (As an undergraduate years ago, I lived in Henderson, "Of Course!")  I shall return to the OPH on this side of the Mississippi!  Kudos to the staff (and the yuppie couple).
5 Excellent breakfast!  Where to start, first this location is nice, new and big.  It's located inside Green Valley Ranch Casino.  I love Henderson and this area very modern and new.  This restaurant is best enjoyed in a large group because there is so much to try and share.  On our last visit we had omelets, honkin big, delish!  We also had the strawberry crepes, outrageously delicate and hearty all at the same time.  The best item for me though is the Dutch Baby, how to even describe it.  Its this huge puffed pastry with a crepe texture that is served with powdered sugar, lemon and butter.  So beyond yum that it brings a tear to your eye.  I recommend the vegetarian omelet with gouda cheese.  The Santa Fe one also looked good with tomato sauce and cilantro but I couldn't try it, too much food!  Wait there's more, the potato pancakes with sour cream and applesauce are awesome and the pumpkin ones too.  Too many dang choices and so little stomach! I heart u OPH!
1 I'm generally pretty patient and not one to complain (at least that's what I think, my BF may tell you something else), but we had the WORST experience ever here. The line for the buffet was ridiculous at 6 PM on Sunday night so we we to the Pancake House which was totally empty. Everything was fine when we placed our orders and got our drinks, but then we waited and waited and waited. Our waitress didn't even come by to give us an update. When we asked her what happened to our food she said ALL of these people are waiting for their food and gestured to the 3-4 other occupied tables as if the place was packed!  It seriously took about an hour before we got our food. When our food came we were informed that they had run out of french fries (wtf?!) and that we would be getting hash browns instead. First of all, how do they run out of fries when no one is there and second, their "hash browns" are really home potatoes. Sorry, I'm a stickler for details :) They must have also run out of hamburger buns because my bacon cheeseburger was on 2 pieces of toast!  Anyway, this was the worst restaurant experience I've had in a LONG time. Obviously something was wrong because no one else seemed to have had such a horrible time. In the end, I guess it kind of worked out because they heavily discounted our bill and we only ended up paying $12 for 4 meals.
4 Food is good, and very generous portions.  They have great pancakes and GREAT omelettes!  Definitely a place not to be missed!
2 I liked the one across town on the west side, but the one at GVR seemed dirty and gross when we ate there. the food was not very good compared to the other one, i will ate GVR cafe any day over this place.
2 I would think a "Pancake House" would have a good size "pancake" to serve. The pancakes that came with my order were super small!  I ordered their omelette which came in the form of a football. (Kinda fat) It was slabbed on a plate with no garnish which didn't look so appetizing. Surprisingly it tasted ok. We ordered a side of hash browns which tasted so bad that I had to return them and cancel the order completely. It was bland and had an aftertaste. Service was horrendous, there weren't enough settings at our table which took forever to get more, cream for our coffee wasn't given till our coffee was cold, and they are cheap on napkins!... Overall, overrated and not impressed.
4 This has been my weekly go-to sunday breakfast spot since I moved here last summer. It's very reliable! Reasons I love it:  *The line you wait in moves very quickly.. I've never had to wait more than 15-20 minutes.  *Service is fast and friendly. *Food is awesome! I love the pancakes and the baked omelettes. Also love that they have gouda cheese! The pumpkin pancakes they serve during the winter months are my favorite.. they even come topped with fresh whipped cream.
3 Decent place to grab breakfast inside the Green Valley Ranch. Has an IHOP feel to it (what do you expect from a chain) and the line can appear daunting, but moves rather fast. In true Vegas fashion its right next to a slew of slot machines to keep you occupied. Decent solid food. Nothing really stood out, but certainly higher quality than IHOP. Great attentive waitstaff and a good deal for the food you receive. Overall I would recommend it, but nothing special.
4 We shared the apple pancakes and they were delicious! The pancake was like custard because it was baked. The apples were amazing! The dish was big enough for two easily!  The large orange juice that was supposed to be a large...was over $4!!! I get it, freshed squeezed, blah blah blah. Oranges are in season and it does not cost 1/16 of that to fill a not so large glass! Rip off! I will still go back when staying at the GVR but won't be ordering OJ :)
3 The Original Pancake House in Green valley Ranch casino has changed. Originally it was located near the parking garage entrance and was AWESOME!!!!! The food, service, and decor were perfect. The only problem was that they never had enough space for all the people. On the weekend the lines were so long it was like waiting for a concert.  Then they moved to the old cafe space in the back of the casino. Much more space. And it started tanking. They brought in a lot of new faces. The food went down almost immediately, the serving sizes shrank, the flavors changed,  the staff were clueless, and worst of all the open area had smoke drifting in from the casino.  Service is now routinely slow and the nice cozy feel is gone. I dont go there anymore. Maybe I should have given it 2 stars..........barely average and if you arent staying in the casino not worth the trip anymore. I used to drive from Summerlin to go there.
5 We loved this place!!  We ate here in Decemeber and saw that we could get a restaurant.com gc, so we thought why not.  Our memory is that the place was a crowded IHOP wanna be but the food was good.  This time we loved the location, food and decor.  It was so much more relaxing and pleasant than our first visit.    I had the strawberry pancakes, hubby had the apple cinnamon pancakes and we shared a side of bacon.  Everything was delicious.  The standout was the side of bacon coming in  around $5 and worth every cent.   I still dream of the bacon....
3 Oh.  My.  Goodness.  When one of my breakfast companions said, "I'll have a Dutch Baby," I was nonplussed.  What the &^%%$* was a Dutch Baby?  So I asked for one too.  It's a huge fried-cake thing and my GOSH it was good!   So was the service (very attentive with the coffee, bringing extra napkins, etc.). They were also very nice about us sitting forever and chatting.  On the down side:  whatever you do, sit at a table, not a booth.  We were offered a booth, and the upholstery had the consistency of a -- well -- a PANCAKE.  Imagine sitting in a bucket of soft foam rubber, with the table up to your chin.  So we asked for a table instead, and they cheerfully moved us.    I'm torn.  The food was four stars, definitely, but the booth was too much of an adventure.  Three stars.  (Something like that always makes me wonder uneasily what else is worn out or neglected.)  A solid A-OK for those pancakes, though.  Now I'm curious about the apple pancakes!
2 Way overpriced for a casino coffeeshop. Value is simply not there. Servers are very pleasant and efficient. But with all the choices in Las Vegas, there should never be a reason why someone sould pay $30-$40 dollars for two people to have breakfast.
2 This place has decent-enough food, but with the terrible service the place has you might as well go to Denny's or IHOP instead.   I went to this restaurant for a reunion with one of my old work mates from the now-defunct Tower Records. I decided to go along, feeling I needed to see these people I hadn't seen in years and try a new restaurant.  Let me start the review by saying I had absolutely no problem with the food here. Our party ordered a plethora of diverse item, and what I tried and saw was very good. The Belgian waffle that I ordered was superb.  But that's where the good stuff ends. Our food took an eternity to come out. I don't think I have ever waited this long to get my food, at ANY restaurant. For this alone, the staff should have discounted our meal, but no one stepped forward to do so.  And it only gets worse! The 6 of us all had different ways of paying (some credit/debit cards, some cash, etc.), and the staff REFUSED TO SPLIT THE BILL. I admit, we probably should have asked them to split the check earlier on, but when you're running a restaurant, you work with your customers and do what is right for them. This meant tons of money borrowing/lending/ATM trips just to pay it. Paying for our food should NEVER be a hassle like this. These jackasses are getting the SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY either way, so how hard would it have been to split the damn check?  My last complaint is that the restaurant has been moved from its original position. Originally it was right inside Green Valley Ranch, just inside of the north doors atop the parking garage. it has now been moved much deeper into the facility, meaning you're going to have a long smoke-filled trek to the restaurant through the casino just to get there.  Seriously, why eat at this place when you can avoid the annoying trek through the parking garage and casino, and just go eat at Denny's or IHOP? The food is about the same quality either way, and I have never had these issues at either of the other chains. So go elsewhere to have your pancake needs filled.  Food: B- Service: F Atmosphere: C
1 We struck out big-time here. We were introduced to the original "Original Pancake House" in Portland, where this chain started. The breakfasts there were sublime. The breakfasts at this outpost were at the opposite end of the spectrum. We shared a Denver omelette, that was 50% more cheese than egg. Not only that, it was tiny and hardly had any veggies or ham. They charged us around $9 for this omelette. I'll happily pay that much for an omelette at the original OPH in Portland, because they are delicious and have more eggs than cheese. The chocolate pancakes were OK, but how can you not have excellent choco pancakes? This is a no-fail recipie...  It's also good to know where to park. This seemed like it was hidden in the back corner of the building, about 1/2 mile from our car. I hope there are closer parking spaces than we found...  (I originally posted this review for the other location of this place in Las Vegas - my error)
4 Pretty decent place.  Really nice food (though a bit more expensive than a lot of comparable places).  Only real gripe is if I recall correctly everything is ala carte (pancakes were by themselves, meat was a separate side) which while opening up the number of potential combinations, it hikes the price a bit.  I have seen a few reviews that dinged the service, however we went to a later breakfast (about 10AM) on a weekday and had no issues at all.
3 I smell...bacon!  Yes, I know this place is called Original PANCAKE House, but have you ever had the bacon here?  To borrow from Jim Gaffigan: "I never feel like I get enough bacon, at breakfast it's like they're rationing it."  Well, if that's the case, come to OPH and order the bacon lovers plate.  7 strips of bacon on one plate.  Yes, 7!  All the meaty, greasy, bacony goodness your arteries can handle.  And these aren't your typical Farmer John, paper-thin slices.  We're talking s-l-a-b-s of pig.  They have other things on their menu, such as, oh, I don't know...pancakes.  The pancakes here have gotten thinner and not as fluffy as they were a couple years back.    The dutch baby is always a winner, but isn't quite filling enough for me on its own.  Unfortunately, after you lather it up with butter, it's almost suicide to add a side of bacon, so really, why even bother?!?  I have a hard time ordering anything here that doesn't come with a pound of bacon (can you tell?).
4 I used to eat here all the time a few years ago but hadn't been back in at least 3 years. That all ended this weekend.   I went and I am happy to report the food is still very tasty. I got a vegetable omelet added bacon & gruyere cheese. Amazing! Pancakes where fluffy and light. I also had a taste of their Philly cheese steak, it was good too.   I'm glad I went back and it is just as good as I remember.
3 Hungover and hungry for breakfast?  This place won't disappoint. Portions: HUGE Prices: fair Service: fine  I shared the biscuits with sausage and poached egg smothered in mushroom sherry gravy. It was definitely enough food for two people. The potato pancakes should be eaten with their chilled apple sauce. That combo was kind of great. I had never eaten potato pancakes before. The gravy was a bit too heavy, but had a nice flavour to it.  I couldn't say anything was particularly original about their food, but it certainly filled me up.
4 Located in the Green Valley Resort & Spa!  I saw that there was a pancake house in the hotel and knew that is where I wanted to have breakfast. We waited about 5 min for a table. (place was packed).   Our server was sooo nice and attentive.  Our food arrived at our table only 10 minutes after ordering.  Talk about quick service. I had their French Toast which was good.  It hit the spot ! (I can't kick this french toast habit!). I also got a side of over easy eggs and and english muffin.  That completed my perfect breakfast meal.  Everything was good and tasty!
4 First of all - do not go here unless you're hungry!  The regular portion of pancakes is 6 pancakes!  The omlette my husband ordered had something like 5 or 6 eggs in it!  All that said, the food was awesome.  I had a half order of pancakes with perfectly cooked poached eggs and my husband had a sante fe omlette.  He said it was the best omlette he had ever had and I cleared my plate of pancakes (half portion). It was all very delicious and the service was friendly and prompt - overall a great breakfast.
4 I've been here twice and each time I've ordered the potato pancakes with sour cream and apple sauce. I've never had to wait more than 5 mins. for a table and food comes out promptly. Servers are attentive and friendly. The portions are huge, I've never been able to finish my plate.   My mom is also a picky eater and orders the corn beefed hash and likes it here. It's hard to find a place where they make it to her liking.
4 Fan freaken tastic! I have been to the original pancake house by disneyland before and have happily stuffed my face with all kinds of goodies. This time it was a different visit. The low carb life style and the original pancake house sound as if they wouldn't mix well...  But they mixed very well. We both ordered the four egg bacon and cheese of your choice ( I picked gouda) omelette. Yes it does take a while to get your plate but it states on the menu that they bake their omelettes so expect a 18 - 20 min delay.  They arrived perfectly cooked. So fluffy and stuffed with so much bacon. I was in heaven.   Service was spot on. Refills arrived promptly and fruit substitutions weren't a problem. When visiting green valley ranch this is the place to stop for breakfast (or brunch depending on how crazy the night before went).
5 ok, truth be told:  other than going to see my most awesome niece and nephew and kick ass sister, THIS is the reason i go to vegas.  yes, there are oph's here in the bay but they can't even begin to compare to the marvel that is the restaurant located in the green valley ranch resort.  everyone that works there is amazing and personable and accomodating.  and everyone there works their butts off.  there is constant hustle.    everything we have had there is delicious.  i am a fan of the irish omelette (cheese and corned beef hash inside).  try it with the gouda and you can't go wrong.  their cheesy potatoes are pretty yum as well.  my niece is a huge fan of the chocolate chip pancakes and always manages to cram in more than she can actually eat.  it's pretty amazing.  other items that have found their way to our table in past visits have been the 49er, the eggs benedict, the potato pancakes, scrambles, crepes and loads of coffee.  everything is big, filling, full of flavor and served quickly.  green valley ranch is gorgeous and classy to begin with.  the restaurant just follows suit.  there is no vegas cheese factor here.  the place is always packed when we go and yet we have never had slow or bad service.  for us, it's like the cherry on top of the sundae of our visit!
2 The Original Pancake House is basically a diner.  Simple food, prepared quickly.  The quality is decent -- think upgraded Denny's -- but nothing special or worth repeated visits unless you like a bland breakfast.   There's nothing particularly amazing about the food or menu choices, but if you're carting around a load of kids, it's not a bad place to go for lots of pancake options (chocolate chip, whole wheat, blueberry, etc).  When we went, we ordered crepes and blueberry pancakes.  The crepes were too sweet and the blueberries on the pancakes weren't fresh.  But the service was great, the coffee never-ending and the bacon was perfectly crispy.
3 Not a lot on the menu for veg lovers, but I did score with the spinach crepe and potato pancakes.  Unfortunately the pancakes were very tasty because they were loaded with the butter they had been fried in.  And the hollandaise sauce was creamy and cheesy, and loaded with fat calories.  Ok, so I wouldn't eat here every day, but it saved me hunting all over for something vegetarian I could eat.
4 Fast service, great food.   I have had their oven baked omelette, oven baked pancake, strawberry crepes and waffles and they have all been delectable. Another plus is their waiting staff, they have all been very friendly and fast for coffee refills and overall service.   The only thing i don't like so far is their benches. They sink too far and make me feel swarmed. I recurrently take the sacrifice for their delicious breakfast carbs.
4 OPH is great now that it is in it's new location inside GVR.  Sitting at the bar is the way to beat the crowds.  The food is good, hot, and big!  I had breakfast there before going out on the Red Riderz Turkey Run last weekend.  The coffee is really good, the waffles rock the house, and the bacon is just right and crispy.  Our waitress was sweet and rolled with our louder-than-usual staccato commentary.  OPH is the place for breakfast.
4 This location is located inside the Green Valley Ranch Casino. It's kinda hard to find, so just follow the signs inside.   What to expect: all your typical breakfast food. Emphasis on different kinds of pancakes in HUGE portions. They have at least 10 different types of pancakes to choose from so I always have a hard time making a decision. They also have your other breakfast favorites like waffles, omletes, bacon, etc.   Their omletes are HUGE and very fluffy since they're oven baked. I've tried almost all of them and they're all equally delicious. They also come with a side of pancakes so it's good pick!  Potato Pancakes: basically hash browns in a pancake form. Comes with apple sauce. This dish is a little too greasy for me, but the pancakes are crispy and the apple sauce helps counter act some of the greasiness.   Eggs Michael: pretty much eggs benedict except with their mushroom sauce which is basically a creamy mushroom sauce that reminds me of cream of mushroom soup. Not bad.   Overall if you're looking for a nice place for a Sunday brunch with the family, this would be a nice place to go :)
2 The Pancake house is located inside GVR. I wish they would have kept the Cafe it was so much better then this spot! Got the eggs,pancakes, and bacon. The eggs were mushy and had no flavor, the bacon was falling apart in pieces because it was so overcooked but the pancakes were decent. The service was good though. I might be back to try the lunch menu
4 I am in love with their German pancake! My fiance thinks it is over rated, but it is just mind blowing for me. I am a fan of thin pancakes (like crepes), which is why I love these. And Original Pancake House is the only breakfast place that has them.... that I have gone to.   Their waffles are wonderful too!   I love this place so much that after i did my first half marathon, as sore as I was, I came down here to have a big meal to reward myself!!! It was totally worth it as I limped away from the restaurant  Service here is great and location is good.
5 It never disappoints. Although I have tried their baked omelets, which I love, I have been stuck on the potato pancakes, whose like I have not seen elsewhere in town.  Great food and outstanding service earns this joint a 5
4 Great breakfast place! The German Pancakes are awesome and definitely worth the wait. This place can get pretty busy, so wait times may be long and service may not be so humble and prompt.
4 One of my favorite breakfast spots. The price is great, service is good and the food hits the spot every time! Their bacon, gigantic and delicious. Green Valley Ranch is the nicest station casino in the area as well. My only suggestion? Watch your eggs and don't be afraid to send them back. They tend to be under cooked at times, depending how you order them.  I totally want one of their cute coffee cups!
3 Good breakfast food, and decent service.
5 Absolutely delish. I got the veggie omelet (comes with pancakes)  and a side of bacon, and split it since it is way too much for just one person.   The omelet was incredible. I usually hate eggs, not a big fan at all, but it was so fluffy and yummy it didn't even have that egg-y taste. I also substituted the mushrooms for jalapenos which gave it a nice kick.    The pancakes that came with were yummy. I had them put chocolate chips and bananas on it, so good. And the whip cream, yummm! It is freshly made and incredible.   The bacon was good, but I have had better.   Overall great experience, the wait was short, we had awesome service, and of course delicious food.
4 Went again this morning. We got the Salami and eggs and the apple pancake and a glass of grapefruit juice.   Both were just ok, not at all as good as the omelet, which is my fav there. The salami and eggs was not scrambled, which is what we expected but more of a quiche type of thing.  This came with potato pancake, which again nothing special and were a bit greasy.  We also go the apple pancake which was really good, but it needed more apples and less "pancake" doughy stuff. The whip cream was still really yummy though.   the juice was great, nice and fresh squeezed. and service was also again really good.   i recommended that you skip everything else on the menu, and go for the omelet since that is incredible and def the best thing, and have them add chocolate chips to the side of pancakes.
4 Breakfast for dinner, what a fantastic idea! We ventured off to Green Valley Ranch for some pancakes and eggs at the Original Pancake House.   It was close to closing time and though I generally despise doing that to the wait staff, my craving for sweet and delicious pancakes overrode my general rule of thumb on this occasion.   The Station Casinos cafe converted into the Pancake House seemed to be a smooth transition. Seated in a comfy booth the service was timely.   Let's talk food, pancakes were comparable to my usual pick, IHOP and the eggs, eh, they were your usual scrambled deal, nothing special. The German potatoes or whatever they're calling them there (ya know, the carbs that accompany your breakfast?), they were seasoned nicely and I did not have a hard time clearing them off of my plate.   All in all, I am still perplexed by the cost of OJ! I understand there may be some additional labor involved in "fresh squeezed" juice, but $4 for a highball glass, really? Whatevs, that is my only real gripe with this fine establishment, that and the fact that the venue closes.   IT'S VEGAS PEOPLE, everything's 24-hours, that's the appeal, isn't it?! And GVR doesn't really have a 24-hour eatery happening anymore so why not leave the Pancake House open for all hungry sinners? Just a suggestion ;)   Give it a whirl if you're in the area, not worth a special trip but did a nice job in hitting the breakfast craving spot.
3 I've been to other Original Pancake House locations, but for some reason the one inside the Green Valley Ranch Casino was better.  Maybe it was the excitement of the casino and family from out of town, but we had a great experience.  The service was great, and my family now say it's going to be a tradition to go there for breakfast, when ever they come to visit me in town.    The Blueberry Crepes is a must order...Delish!!!
4 I love gravy and that's the one thing this place is missing.  Missing big time because gravy is one of the most delicious things ever!  Besides not having gravy this place is great.  The pancakes are delicious and being named 'The Pancake House' they have many different kinds.  The Pecan and Bacon are my favorite.  I think bacon pancakes are second only to gravy in deliciousness.  Whenever I go I get one of their omelets.  I try to eat right and I trick myself into thinking that a bacon and gouda omelet is just full of protein and dairy. My scale tells me differently but it's always worth it. The omelets are huge and extremely tasty.  My family likes appetizers, even at breakfast.  The chocolate crepes are usually passed around the table for everyone to try.  While I couldn't down the whole dish by myself, the crepes are amazing! Since they've moved into the old cafe the wait time seems to be much shorter. Service has been par everytime I have gone.  My one complaint rhymes with Davy.
3 I had breakfast here several times recently.  We tended to go early in the morning and got good service.  Omlettes and pancakes were excellent.  I definitely never left hungry.
4 This was our first visit, me and my wife got the oven baked omlettes, I got the mushroom which was very good I thought and she got the corned beef hash which was good but a little skimpy on the CBH I thought. These omlettes were massive (probably enough for two) and she couldn't finish hers so I helped but gave up because I was so full. My daughter got the lasagna which she liked, I tried it and thought it was good as well. The restaurant itself is very upscale looking and has flat screen TVs and I think ESPN was on, as far as ambience goes it blows IHOP out of the water. As far as the menu goes it wasn't very extensive compared to IHOP, the complete dining experience (service/food/atmosphere) is good enough to recommend OPH. I actually was least impressed with their pancakes, they were okay but quite small, with a name like OPH I expected some big honkin flapjacks like I've seen on Food Networks "Man vs Food" or "Diners, Drive Ins and Dives".  Oh, if you're on a budget look for their coupon in the Valu Pak which comes periodically in the mail. Even with the coupon we nearly spent $40 including the tip. Although next time we'll save some money by ordering just one omlette.
3 I have been wanting to try this place since I moved out here, and was slightly disappointed by the food. I ordered the Michaels Eggs with potato pancakes (my fave) and was disappointed because the pancakes were no more than hashbrowns in a circular shape. Hubby got banana pancakes which I tried, and were good, but no more than just regular old pancakes with bananas on top. Where is the flavor? Anyway, service was great and the bill wasn't very much. Not a very long wait either for a Sunday brunch. Might be back if Eggworks down the road isn't insanely busy.
2 This place looks awesome. The smell of the maple syrup blasts the air while you wait on line to get in. Granted, outside of Vegas(ahem, Henderson) I am pretty sure their is no line.  The food, well it is not that great. It certainly doesn't inspire me to come back and try other menu items. More or less inspires me to wish I hadn't paid so much for the food!  Like so many national chain stores, great look, great concept. Just no real delivery of something worthwhile. It also tries to play the 'Olde Fashioned Game' with locations nationwide and corporate reps throughout the business...its about as old fashioned as the Casino that its in.
2 Eh... okay. Not great, but not bad. The omelettes are obscenely large... that's not a compliment! LOL.
1 We have an Original Pancake House in my home town. Same food, but way more expensive. Next time I'm hitting the $5 breakfast buffet and saving the additional $45 it cost me for 3 entrees, 2 small glasses of OJ, 1 glass of milk and a cup of coffee.
4 I love pancakes!   Now that we got that out of the way...let's move on to the review.   When I got there, there was a line. But it was moving quickly. 5-10 min wait. Fanfreakintastic.   We had a sweet older lady as our waitress. She was amazing! She has a favorite-grandma essence to her.   I couldn't decide between the chocolate chip pancakes and another dish and i really really wanted some bacon that morning! so she suggested getting the senior special (cheaper price! Score! Btw I am not a senior citizen) and a side of the chocolate chip pancakes.   Our food came out great, nothing to complain about. My bacon came out extra crispy not burnt just the way I like it!!!  I really loved their chocolate chip pancakes!!! The chips are slightly warm and oh so smearable on your pancakes. scooped some of the side whip cream and  tossed it on my pancake, took the first bite and I was in pancake heaven. no need for syrup... it was delicious just with the  melted chocolate chips n whip cream.  she checked up on us a couple of times...I always appreciate that and not afraid to give a larger tip when that happens. I have got to say she was one of the best servers I've had any where. That's a lot coming from me, I take that sh*t seriously when it comes to any customer service. :)   Can't wait to go again!
3 After losing all your money at the penny slots, blacking out from drinking one too many apple-tini's; there's nothing more comforting than a sweet smile from an attentive waitress, hot coffee and cold oj to go along with a nice filling breakfast.   OPH served it all up, especially with a line way shorter than the one for the buffet. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p7RWwyP49cDwgvoK1Um8Mg?select=3Cnddjx72U0DVabeEzXKXw)  *German pancake aka Dutch Baby (signature dish) $10- Baked so it looks like a deflated popover. Coming sprinkled with powdered sugar, it was like a thick crepe with subtle sweetness. The lemon and butter they give you as a topping is interesting. Eating this dish is like eating at the buffet, so you could probably order the smaller size. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p7RWwyP49cDwgvoK1Um8Mg?select=UySg86682T1ALQZRoSSdfw)  Mushroom omelet - $10. They don't mess around. The thing is huge and can easily feed like 10 senior citizens. It's a little bit different from a standard omelet since they take the eggs, cook it in a skillet and then bake it. They even give you 3 buttermilk pancakes, which we couldn't even touch we were so full. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p7RWwyP49cDwgvoK1Um8Mg?select=ngoFBlaMQh9mXRES_mpU0Q)  The food is overflowing and hearty, 2 people can easily share one plate.  You're definitely going to need energy to get back to the slots, this food can put you to sleep.
4 Original pancake house relocated to the old grand cafe. Much of the vast space is unused and takes away from the quaint thoughts of breakfast.   The menu offers it all: crepes, pancakes, waffles, French toast, benedict, and so on. Prices are fairly high but not unexpected for inside a lovely hotel like GVR.   Started with coffee and o.j.  The coffee was superb. No complaints. Well, they don't have flavored creamer or lattes or anything.... The o.j. was clearly fresh squeezed and extremely pulpy.   I had eggs Michael. A rendition of Benedict with sausage patties and a mushroom sherry cream sauce. Really good. Eggs cooked perfectly. Seasoned nicely. Piping hot. 4 crispy potato pancakes on the side with sour cream and applesauce. Lots of food! I would have preferred toast in lieu of 2 potato pancakes so I could mop up my yolky cream sauce goodness.   Hubby had corned beef hash. Although it showed close resemblance to the magical canned version, it lacked fat so, therefore, was a bit dry.   $32 for 2 coffees, 2 breakfasts and 1 juice. $38 with tip. A bit steep for breakfast but satisfying nonetheless.
4 Omelettes are amazing. The other stuff is ok but the omelettes are the best. Service is pretty good and if you park in the back of gvr is pretty convienant. Its a tough choice for breakfast over here with the cracked agg and hash house being so close.
4 Great food, Perfect portions for breakfast.
1 restaurant is closed and not open for business anymore.
4 Go to the one in the Green Valley Ranch Casino instead. Which is along the freeway to the Mc Carren Airport.
