3 I've never used the word Meh in my life but it's hard to come up with something else to say about this place. It's just ok.   The food is average, the music is average and staff are friendly enough, the place is clean enough...it's boring. The cost of the food is literally the average of the 5 other places I checked out that day...Yes, I was so bored I did the math.   It's not a bad place, but it's certainly not worth writing to your aunt peggy about.
2 There's something about the word 'guts' and the general sloppy, greasy nature of the food that puts me off this place.   Nonetheless you should expect the usual builder's favourites of sausage and egg rolls with a generous dollop of brown sauce and other portable greasy spoon fare.  Cheap and cheerful, but not tempting enough to lure you all the way down to Leith.
