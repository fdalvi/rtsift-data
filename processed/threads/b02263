4 Really fast service, those nasty little tacos came with lots of shredded lettuce, which I requested, and it's close to my house.  Thanks, Jack in the Box.
1 Nastiest food I,ve ever had from a Jack in the Box, tacos were stale and extra greasy,  burgers were burnt, bread was stale and burnt, fries were old.
5 Great Service. Gwen is usually the Drive Thru cashier when I eat here. She always has a smile and a welcome. The food is hot and freah, I have never been disappointed. I love the Breakfast Jack, the best breakfast sandwich to eat while driving.  I have used their dining room also, usually on the weekends. The dining room and bathroom are always clean.
1 The French fries were so soggy you could use them as shoe laces , also portions were undersized not one of the containers were full to the top , not that any of us wanted to eat them
4 I've always had great customer service from this location no matter what time I go. I've gone from breakfast in the morning to late late night snacks. I usually get potato wedges so I just wish they were a bit more consistent with how much cheese sauce they use. Though, that's just to be expected at drive-thru fast food.
1 What a crap experience !  Get someone who listens and speaks clearly to work the drive through!  Hope that idiot working there tonight enjoys that job because Jack in the box is about as good as he will get!
3 Clean restaurant, only two guys working behind the counter, our food came out pretty quick but the people after us were in line for a long time, 2 ppl actually walked out mumbling how long they were taking.   Drive thru service seem to be quicker since they seemed more focused on those customers. If I'm in a pinch and super hungry and in the area, will be back.
