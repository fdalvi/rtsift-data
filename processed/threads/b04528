5 Most knowledgable associates hands down.
1 I simply called to get some info about t-moble. And curious about the data plan and the process. And the mister i was talking over the phone was an AssHole very rude, and doesn't give a shit about new costumers.
5 they came thru and fixed the problem. that's the t-mobile i know and love!!
5 Well, I wanted to give T-Mobile credit where credit is due. My faith has been restored. I wanted to update everyone and let you know that T-mobile did come through for me and once again T-Mobile has became the compassionate and understanding company that I have grown to love over the past ten years. Yes, today I heard them thank me for my business and being a customer for the past 10 YEARS!!!   Many times companies are written about when things go bad (just as I did) but I was truly upset and felt so abandoned by a company that I had faithfully used and paid on a monthly basis for up to 5 lines. Something that I felt should have been considered when I ran into this problem with an upgrade.  Well, let it be known, T-Mobile did wave the migration and termination fee and not only that I was able to change my family plan to a MUCH BETTER ONE and for LESS MONEY!!!!! BAM!!!   THANK YOU T-MOBILE!!! LOVE YOU AGAIN!!!!
