3 The service here is nice and the time frame is quick, usually a one day turn around. My one complaint (and this is big) is that the place smells. I cannot trust a cleaners that smells bad...
4 I have been happy with this cleaner.  Last tie I was in, the nice gal there told me about the Members club.. pretty straight forward, pay $4 up front, get a special dry cleaning container bag, and get 40% off all dry cleaning and %20 off all household dry cleaning (comforters, etc) - how cool is that? Their staff has always been kind, quick, and they seem to do their job well.  Our clothes are always dry cleaned well... so, I'm a fan!
1 GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. I submitted 6 button down shirts and a year old Ralph Lauren suit. They lost 3 shirts, but only told me they lost 2. Weeks later while I was submitting my claim they found my shirts. The worst part was my suit had a small hole on the back of the jacket. I had to let them know how much the suit was first to submit my claim and when I did I expected to be reimbursed. I received a check for $7.95 and a $5.00 store credit. The suit was about $700 so I thought they made a mistake, but no. The letter they sent included a brochure about how insects can cause holes in suits and that was the reason for the hole and the responsibility was mine. I have never experienced a hole in ANY of my clothes, EVER, and the suit did NOT have a hole when I turned it in. I was outraged when I spoke with one of the owners of the company, who treated me like a child and told me life isn t fair. Unless you want to deal with a company who has insects that can ruin your clothes, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.
