4 I fell on this store by accident. I was across the way, spilled coffee on myself and went to Stash to grab a top. They have amazing jeans, super cute tanks and the best sales people! The guy actually gave me the shirt they had on hold since he said "the previous woman was so rude you deserve it":) The best selection of Rock & Republic jeans I have ever seen!
1 I went to this store for alterations to jeans that my husband and I had purchased. This place was recommended to us. When we arrived, we were completely ignored by one of the salespeople. The two other sales people were better, but one was giving advice to a woman telling her something looked great on her when it clearly did not. When the alterations woman approached me, she was very gruff and bent over asking me lazily if where I rolled my jeans was where I wanted the hem. ??? I asked how much the charge would be and she said $30! We were told $15 before going... I'm not paying that for a simple hem. As we walked out, one of the sales people asked me why I was leaving. I told him we were misquoted. He said the charge is supposed to be $25. I told him the alterations woman told me $30... All around terrible experience. This is the type of place that has sales people that will kiss your butt if you have an alternative lifestyle, but if you're married with children, forget it.
