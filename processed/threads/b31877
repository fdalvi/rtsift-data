5 I stumbled on this place with a groupon good for a month of boot camp classes and 2 hours of personal training. I did the bootcamp class only once, it was a fantastic workout, but bootcamp classes isn't really my thing. I was interested in the training. I worked out twice with Jason, he's a very good teacher! I came in relatively fit, but not really knowing how to lift weights. I ended up spending 12 more sessions with Jason and I'm stronger and fitter! Better yet, I know how to work out with weights now (teach a man to fish.....). The facilities are nice, there are 2 private showers and since its bootcamp or workouts with trainers only, its never crowded.
5 I was looking to get back into working out again, and my boss said she knew a guy who was a personal trainer and that she would go with me if i was serious about getting started! Thus began the beginning of a beautiful PTship with Vin my personal trainer! He has now been kicking my ass into shape for over a month and I feel better and can't wait to keep continuing down the path of health and shitasticness! :) Thanks Pro Fitness! You're awesome and you keep me motivated!!! If you need the extra push to get motivated, this is the place where you should start!
5 If you're serious about your health, and fitness, go see the great trainers at Pro Fitness in Tempe.  Vin, Dylan, Aaron, LaSalle, Paul, and the rest of the crew are great professionals who know their stuff.  Too expensive?  Try having a year of medical bills because you're not fit...  Sanman
