5 Great location and staff.   Came here to drop off some books to send back to Chegg. The young lady working had awesome pink hair! She was really nice and bubbly, scanned my books and had me out in no time with receipt in hand!
1 I thought I'd just run in since it wad close by...WASTE of my time! The owner is the rudest business owner I've met in awhile, I'm not sure how they expect to keep the business running with that kind of attitude- not caring and apparently not happy with life in general. I was late getting back to work because they were incompetent and over charged me TWICE and had to redo the transaction! I ended up taking my packages and documents and telling them to cancel everything. NEVER going back yo this one- I'll drive out of my way to avoid it from now on
1 Website and front door say business opens at 8:00 am.  Twice in the last month I have gone here at 8:15 am, and its still closed.  This is extremely unprofessional and I will never give them my business again for wasting my valuable time before work in the morning.
1 Buyer beware PO Box rental -  After almost 2 years of renting a po box I informed the owner I didn't need my po box anymore. When I asked about forwarding  mail I was told mail can't be forwarded from a po box, which is fine, so I asked if that is the case please return any mail to the postman.. I was then firmly told they would hold all mail for 6 months and if I wanted to get it I would have to pay for 6 more months for the po box... MY MAIL will be held hostage unless I pay almost $200 seems like it should be mail theft... the worst of it was the attitude of the owner who pretty much told me if I dont like it then pay the hostage charge...  BUYER BEWARE!
1 Bring your own tape and scissors.  I wasn't allowed to use theirs because of "insurances", and they charged me $2 to tape my package.  Business must be slow.  FEDEX next time.
