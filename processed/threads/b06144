5 Go see Jessica Banks for cut/color. Extremely nice and the only person i let touch my hair besides myself. Plus affordable.
1 Don't waste your time. I only went in because from the outside it looks like a beauty supply but when I walked in it was 70% empty, I thought they were going out of business. I asked for what I was looking for and one of the ladies standing around chatting rudely told me that they were a salon and I needed to go to Sally's. I would've never guessed that place was a salon, but I will never go there again.
