5 Exceptionally friendly customer service and very good prices. Highly recommended.
4 A great cleaners who does everything onsite.  I think they are locally owned and are really nice people.  It's priced like all the others too.  No price gouging here!  We get tired of the pre-paid crap owned by some Arab, that is sent out somewhere and is only a store front.  This one is definitely not one of those.
5 Prices are comparable but the service is unbeatable.  Great friendly people that really care about you and know how to provide a good customer experience.  Highly recommended.
1 Good prices until the owner decided not to  take ownership of his staff ruining 2 of my shirts. I was told something to the effect of "There is no way we could've put those stains on your shirts"... I guess it's an impossibility for dry cleaner to ruin shirts. His compromise was offering me a $20 credit, which would've covered 20% of the value of the shirts lost. I won't continue to play Russian roulette with my nice clothing... I'd advise you to do the same. The humorous part of the whole thing is I probably spent over $50 per month on dry cleaning... a savvy business person would've pulled my account, realized the value of a good customer, and done the right thing.
