5 These guys were great. Quick, reasonable price and professional
4 These guys were great to me and if they were not so far away I would have used them since I paid 50% more to hire someone closer.  I only needed my 2 front windows redone on a 1 year old used car I bought that some moron put limo tint on and I could not see my mirrors.  Sounds silly but somehow the reflection of my light colored dash blocked the view completely and they were only going to charge $65 to replace both windows, what a steal!  However, I ended up going to somewhere closer to my house for convenience and spent $90 so I could be picked up by my spouse while it was getting done.  Wish I could have used them but they were super nice and accomidating so I thought I should at least write them a review for that.
5 I took my Prius here to have one window re-tinted. The service guys were all friendly and quickly got my car in.  The job was done right, efficiently, and everyone was really nice.  Would recommend to family and friends.
5 Awesome job. I was impressed with the quality and the ease of getting in same day. I would recommend this place to anyone. There prices are very reasonable.
