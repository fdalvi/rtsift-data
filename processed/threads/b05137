3 Big 5 Sporting Goods is your run of the mill sporting goods store.  They have more reasonable prices then Sports Challet and Sports Authority but their selection is sometimes lacking.  I mean due to the size restraint alone that Big 5's usually have they can't carry as much stuff as the other places.  That is also the charm of Big 5, whereas you would have to go through 3-4 people when at the other places, at Big 5 you deal with 1-2.  I think the associates are a little more inclined to take care of what you need as well.  An overall thumbs up for Big 5.
5 What they may sometimes lack in availability of products, they make up in customer service.  The associates have gone above & beyond on several occasions to accommodate me and make me happy.  This is simply way I am loyal to Big 5, especially this store.
