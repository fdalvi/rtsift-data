4 This woman does excellent work in a short amount of time. It's reasonably priced, too -- for a bridesmaid's dress that needed adjusting on two straps and work on the bodice, it cost about $84.
5 This woman is the best in town, but she is semi-retired so her hours are a bit infrequent. She is slightly more expensive than other places in town, but is totally worth it!
5 Nice altering work. Same guy working 15 hours a day. Always delivers on time and very friendly.
