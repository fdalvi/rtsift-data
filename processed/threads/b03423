3 A fast food place, but of all the fast Japanese food places I've been to [and I've tried most of them], I would rate this one highest.  3 stars is the highest I'd rate a fast food joint.  If you get the chicken, I would recommend getting the all white meat rice bowl.  I prefer their beef bowls.  Their sushi rolls are sub-par, and since they are pre-made, I wouldn't recommend them.  Their wraps are good as well.
5 I love samurai sams and the service from Nacho (the cook) over the years has been great. He is always super friendly and makes the t-bowl just how I like it. I like the white meat chicken bowl with no veggies and brown rice. Comes out to 450 calories a perfect lunch. You can also grab a bottle of the sauce for 5$. My only suggestions for this location would be to have more reading material for the lunch crowd and to give out free side sauces rather than charge 25 cents. Sam Sams is a favorite for a healthy tasty lunch!

4 My parent's business use to be next door to one of these places....  For this location, I would recommend eating here on the weekdays ONLY. The guy (mencho) that makes the bowl has been doing it for a long time and knows how to make them the best.   If you are really hungry or want to get a bowl for two meals I would recommend the sumo bowl. It only costs 8 dollars + change and its loaded with meat, veggies and rice. Another good entree is the Yaki Soba, which are grilled noodles with veggies (make sure to add your meat choice it costs extra). If you want to give your salad more of a zing rather than the plain rice vinegar go with the ginger dressing - its delicious.   Enjoy the sweetness of  the massive amounts of sugar and tastiness of their Teriyaki sauce! But if you are looking for a healthier option go with the white meat chicken, more veggies than brown rice option. Food is usually pretty fresh.  Remember to get stamp card if you are regular, 10 stamps = $5 off a purchase :)
