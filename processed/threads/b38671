4 Have been to this chapel a few times & would go again. I love it's history & the building. It's a shame it is covered but if that makes it last a few more hundred years then it's worth it. It always supprisese me about the temperature inside even on a hot summers day it's freezing. The ornate but crumbling images on the walls are out of this world Always a busy place for tourists.
3 Eine kleine feine Kapelle, die historisch sicherlich Einiges zu bieten hat, bei Dan Brown Erwähnung findet und ziemlich viele Touristen anzieht. Habe mir mehr davon erhofft. Kinder sind übrigens frei.
5 Lovely little chapel. Well worth a visit. Recent renovations have almost been completed. The steel roof & scaffolding are now all gone. There's some ongoing repairs to the stonework outside but what a difference from my last visit 3 years ago.  We arrived just in time for a tour by Neil, one of the guides. He was informative & witty & I'd recommend the tour. It was only 25 mins but covered the history & tales of the chapel.  The new visitor centre is great & has little pods showing videos, there's a small interactive zone & a great wee cafe with an outside terrace that overlooks the glen.  The castle ruins are a 5 minute walk from the chapel & you can also walk down into the glen itself.   Definitely a great way to pass a few hours in some beautiful countryside. Lothian buses run to Roslin so it's easy to get to, too. It's a perfect place to escape the city especially if you need a break from the Festival crowds.
