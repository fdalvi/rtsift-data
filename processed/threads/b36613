5 This, by far, is the nicest, biggest, cleanest Goodwill I have ever been too.  I was on the way home from a friend's house today, and stopped here before getting on the expressway.  This is one of the locations that I have not been to before, despite me being very familiar with the area.   When I walked in, I was blown away! HUGE SELECTION OF STUFF! OMG!  Everything here is so organized, and they have a TON of stuff to choose from! (I've been to a few very sad neglected Goodwill's in my day...THIS is not one of them!)  I searched through a bunch of clothes, shoes and other stuff while I was here. I didn't buy anything on this visit, but I will be back. Place is awesome, well organized and in really good shape. If you want a really nice goodwill with tons of stuff to choose from, go here! Best store ever!
4 I show up here from time to time. It is a large store. It is clean and organized inside.  It is PACKED on sales days.   I've found a few items here including a almost new bottle of Dream Angels perfume for $2. Not bad!  I've purchased a few clothing items here for myself..... jackets and sweaters really. Even a jacket for my son.   They always have TONS of stuff in the home section. I usually have good luck finding jewelry boxes to re-finish here. I got a nice bookshelf here too.  I give it 4 instead of 5 stars because of the theft. I know it's no fault of the sore BUT every single time I find a movie worth watching it's gone. Someone stole the DVD. If you know all the DVDs get stolen why not move them maybe closer to the jewelry counter?  Also... ATTENTION PEOPLE STEALING DVDS FROM GOODWILL. QUIT BEING A DOUCHE BAG... EITHER DON'T STEAL OR TAKE THE CASE WITH THE DVD.   Thanks.
