1 We actually stopped by Nov 27th to view some of the floor plans, but left very disappointed.  Although the floor plans were beautiful, the representative who assisted us, did not give us the level of engagement I would of felt necessary to make customers comfortable and welcome.  In fact, it was quite the opposite.  The representative was not friendly nor engaging.  The individual was not informative or even interested in our presence what so ever.  It made our excitement deflated and really ruined the whole experience for us.  What I was looking to be the first step of an exciting journey into purchasing a new home turned into a wrong turn down the wrong road.
1 Over Priced, Poor Amenities, HOA Fees to High, Not enough money put back in for what is taken in, Poorly run, Greedy realtor, ST is a Joke. Go ahead buy a Safari Drive Condo and Find Out the Hard Way.
5 Safari Drive is an awesome place to live.  It is located within walking distance of everything in downtown Scottsdale.  The architecture is very modern, more like a Newport Beach or Manhatten loft.  Workmanship is outstanding.  We bought about 9 months ago, and it has been amazing how the units have increased in value.  Can't wait for SF Giants Spring training,  We can walk to the park.  The Safari staff does a terrific job.  If either of the reviewers who gave it one star had bought when they wrote the review, they'd be sitting on a bunch of home appreciation and be living in the coolest place in Downtown Scottsdale.  We love it!
5 Location. Location. Location.   Modern and edgy, high-end fixtures, so many different floor plans, floor to ceiling windows, concrete floors, views of Camelback...what else do you need? Better than The Optima and Waterfront combined.  #loveit
