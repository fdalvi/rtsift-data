1 Not a shuttle service I will use twice.  Pros: Cheaper than cab for larger parties and van was nice as appears on website. Cons: Driver arrived late, calling for directions after we were scheduled to be picked up.  Driver got ticket on way to salt river destination for speeding.  Picked up 1.5 hours late after prearranged scheduled pick up. Not fun sitting in the sun waiting and wondering if your gonna get picked up after floating on the river for four hours. Company requires full payment up front in cash (no recourse if dissatisfied)  Advice for anyone thinking about using this service and trying to save a buck by using a discounted shuttle company is don't pay until service is rendered. Management assured me that this isn't the service levels we should expect from his company but offered no reimbursement other than apologies for the inconvenience.
5 This is the best way to get around the valley if you a traveling with a large group. Its efficient, and cheaper than a cab. A new, very clean van comes and picks you up with a very professional driver. This is the way to get to the clubs, the river a spring training game, wherever you need to go. Book the wagon and you won't regret it.
5 The big red wagon took myself plus a group of 10 to the Luke Bryan concert and we had a blast! Jennifer was our driver who was so sweet and understanding. My group was drunk and a little annoying towards the end of the night but she took great care of us. The ride was very reasonable, comfortable, and safe. I recommend them over a limo any day.
5 I am so impressed by this company. I called in a panic & they got back to me within a few hours (called at 7pm they called back at about 9pm). This was 100% opposite of the BOB who despite me being a returning customer could not do so after 3 days. I will be using them in the future from now on!
