4 Where one can find by far the coolest things, from art to antiques and quite the nice furniture for a very cheap price.
4 This is by far one of the better & bigger GW's in the valley. Their prices are more in line with Savers or Epic. -Not crazy or sizist (smells are more expensive than Larges, or vice-versa) like a few of the other Goodwill locations. They are pretty organized & their staff is friendly. I try to make a stop here whenever I'm even remotely near the area.
