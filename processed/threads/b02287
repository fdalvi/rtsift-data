4 I really don't know how to properly review a Savers.  I mean, its not Neiman Marcus, nor is it a Dillards.  Anyways, I have been in here a few times because I have needed random things for a variety of home projects.  I guess Savers carries a lot of used clothing like the Goodwill would do, along with new items as well.  The reason I like it here is because, well, you can actually not only donate to a good cause, but you can find stuff for you house that maybe you wouldn't want to pay full price for at a retail store. I've been here a few times and scored a few things that were of benefit to me!
4 Like most Savers this store is huge (former supermarket locale) with tons of merchandise, most of it in very good condition.  I got three tops and a Hawaiian dress.  My daughter got several tank tops for a trip she's taking, the reason we were there in the first place.  I like this store. (4/09)
4 I shopped at this Savers MANY times in the past. I liked the store a lot. However, they closed this location several months ago. If you are planning to go to Savers, check their Web site for a current location that is near you. http://www.savers.com/Default.aspx
