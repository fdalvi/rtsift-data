1 I live by this place its looks like shady poor people live here it creeps it out I dont care too much for the neighborhood too much either.
1 I took my 6 year old son here to visit his Mother after we divorced and it was daytime and I was spooked, as the sun went down I took him and left. The next time I told Mom that we would meet at Dennys from then on. It is scary and drug dealers live there. The bathroom is bigger than the room itself. Not all the people there are bad, some are good but are just really down on their luck. Some people even own cars there including a guy who owns a new looking white Ford F-350. Stay away from here if you know what's good for you. It is a last of the last resort place to live, not really a motel anymore.
