5 Again I'm surprised nobody has found this place.  Just 30 minutes from Sun City Grand (Ah, maybe that's why).  Absolutely GREAT stage shows like the Redneck Tenors, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Brubeck Brothers, Kathy Mattea, PLEASE, use this info for yourself and don't pass it on.  Because it's only a 600 seat place and there are no bad seats.  Believe me, NONE!  Call them or visit their website and GO!
5 A really great place for a great show!  This place is a treasure and always has an eclectic schedule.  Students 18 and under are only $5, too, so it can't be beat.  I highly recommend trying them out.  My only recommendation is to make reservations for dinner before the show, because the local restaurants will get jam packed.
5 Took my girls out for Valentine's on Saturday night! Jeanne Robertson was in town, always wanted to see her but was never out west until now. This center is not that big, but that is fine with me! You don't have to deal with the outrageous crowd, and everything else that comes with it! I can truly say that there is not a bad seat in the place!! Seats are comfortable, and they don't try to squeeze you in a sardine can! And of course the show made it that much better! If they are having any other show I want to see, I will be there again!!
