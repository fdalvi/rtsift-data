1 To small and to expensive. They don't control neighbor issues, and they dont refund deposit even I spent 6 hours cleaning the place to make it look better than when I moved in.. Stay away. For the money you can find tons of places better..Manager of the building is also above the tenants. She needs people Skills if she is going to be in the people business
1 IF YOU ARE READING THIS, DO NOT SIGN A LEASE!!  Our lease will be up in a few months and we couldn't be more happy. When we first moved in we noticed some ROACHES. We called the office and was told pest control would be out in a few days. My partner called them back and yelled at them to get someone out faster. It was finally taken care of, but that's how they think of their tenants. They wouldn't for a second live with ROACHES, but we were expected to.  Another issue are the neighbors. They leave trash out and even have couches on their front porch. Management doesn't enforce any of the rules and are basically lazy.  Many people with dogs don't pick up the shit, and management just leaves it there too. There are also a million cigarette butts everywhere.   In short it's a place that looks very nice, but is really just a dump that's too expensive. My advise would be to rent a nice house for the same price.
1 Do not move in!!  This place has the thinnest walls ever.  You can hear your neighbors conversations.  The appliances are so loud.  The dryer shrinks and ruins all your clothes.  The carpets are cheap.  The place is a going down hill.     For what you pay in rent you can find something better.  Trust the reviews.  DO NOT MOVE IN.
