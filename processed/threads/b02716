5 My wife first took her car here & got the mini-detail. It was an excellent job, especially for the money. We began bringing our trucks here soon after. They do an amazing job every time. They all, including the owner, greet you buy name after the first visit (maybe they just remember me because my trucks are always filthy!) It's the only place we take our trucks now.
5 The owner, Chris, is a great example of how a small business owner hustles to make his business a success. Wash n Roll do a great job at a fair price.
5 Excellent service, attention to detail and friendly staff.Great value at $10.00. Will use them again.
