5 Eid Ul Fitr prayers were beautiful. The mosque is brand new and had really good accomodations for the crowd to bring them from the off site parking situation in little vans to the mosque and back. They also had a play area set up for all the kids in the back after the prayers. Will go here again even though I live in Ahwatukee....
5 alhamdulillah an amazing masjid. very mixed cultures which is beautiful and supportive!
