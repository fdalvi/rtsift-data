4 The first time I came to Serenity Nails was as a walk-in. I was greeted immediately and with great courtesy. This salon is very clean and the staff are extremely friendly. I come here regularly, and consistently receive excellent service. The cost is a touch pricey, but considering the quality of service and attention to detail I am more than willing to pay for it. I have never, ever felt hurried, and  a result I can sit back and relax which, as us girls know, is an important part of the entire mani/pedi experience. As I have stated in previous reviews, service is so, so important to the overall experience of any business hoping for repeat customers. In this case, I can state with absolute confidence that I will fall into that category.
5 Great friendly place! My nails always look great! They have good specials Mon-Thurs ;) husband and wife owners, always happy and honest! Wait times are always minimal! They have a lot of techs, and you can tell that everyone is treated with respect! I love how friendly it is, I always get a good laugh!;)
2 Payed $22 for a half job pedi!!!...second time disappointed never going back..
1 I wouldn't even give this place one star. Went here for a pedicure and left extremely unhappy.  The gal had me soaking in the chair for 25 minutes before even beginning, and also had the nerve to leave me mid job to go do an eyebrow wax. Needless to say, she didn't get a tip. I recommend not going and I won't be back. Shitty service and employees.
3 A little pricier than where I am from but fast and efficient service. They also have tons of colors to choose from and are well staffed. This trip I only got a gel overlay on my nails, I'll definitely be back.
3 Service received -mani - pedi, great job. Basic manicure only lasted 2 days (with hands use in consideration), pedicure still looks nice after 4 days.  Friendly customer service.  Cleanliness - Dirty, they really need to dust...overhead light covers, clean the arm rest on the pedicure chairs, dust behind the chairs, and pick up the magazines. And clean you trash cans and once a week wipe down the bottom of your chairs. I know you are trying to service your customers but the untidiness makes customers feel uneasy about your sanitary practices (pedicure tub-manicure tools).  I will give them another chance...hopefully it will be cleaner next time.
5 I've been going here for eyebrow waxing and nail/toenail painting for almost two years. I love this place! Super friendly staff, really quick and they do a great job! I got a full set put on for an event once and those suckers stayed on until they grew out, they didn't come off at all. They do an excellent job and I'll keep coming back even though we moved further away.
5 Note that I am SUPER PICKY when it comes to pedicure and manicure. I quit going to salons in Reno as bone of them seem to do it right.  As I was out of town I was in dying need of ped and mani with Gelish. I finally gave in and visited Tammy at Serenity Salon. OMG what a wonderful lady. I like my nails soaked off - not dremeled. She didn't even question and did as I requested. It is a busy salon but she took time to make sure everything was done correctly.  Totally worth 50% tip
