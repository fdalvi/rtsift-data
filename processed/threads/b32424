1 This is possibly one of the most ridiculous things that has ever occured to me in a "coffee shop".  This $tarbucks is located inside the Safeway at 7th Ave & Osborn.  I rarely ever patronize a Sbucks, but my grandmother was wanting some coffee, so I obliged.  Being the coffee snob I am, I opted for a tea.  Even bagged tea is better than corporate coffee in my eyes (even if it's by the same company).  I ordered an iced rooibos.  Tea.  Who can screw that up, right?  He made my grandmother's latte, which appeared "fine" (though one has to wonder) and proceeded onto my tea.  Plastic cup.  Adds ice.  Fills with water.  Adds tea bag.  Swirls the cup around and hands it to me.    -- "Do you want a second tea bag or something?"  -- "Huh? What? Why would I need two tea bags?"  I stand there acting confused.  Did you expect ice water to create iced tea, or any tea at all?  I tell him he has to brew the tea, then dump it over ice.  He shoots back that he did *exactly* that.  I demand he remake it.  This time I told him to brew me the hot tea, give me a separate cup filled with ice, and I will deal with the tea steeping and such.  He does that, and I make my tea.  Ugh.
1 What can really be said about starbucks that hasn't already? What seems to be 10 years ago awesome coffee has turned into todays "meh... ive had better."  This is the location inside the safeway. I usually stick to a tea, but if you're looking for coffee close to this area, try Lux on central about .5 miles away.
5 Today I went to Starbucks for there BOGO free deal with my mom.  The lady at Starbucks was really nice.  I got my favorite peppermint mocha and my mom got eggnog latte.    It is nice to get a drink in Safeway.  Then you can in joy your coffee and do your grocery shopping at the same time.  :)
4 Love this Starbucks. The employees are always friendly and get your drinks promptly. Because it is in a Safeway, they may not have everything a standalone would have but that's okay.
4 I should say when we went to this Starbucks it was 5:30am, and none of us had more than 5 hours sleep the night before.  SO...that said...the person making the drinks was very nice, and got the order right.  I got a caramel macchiato, extra hot with low fat milk.  I added whipped cream....because I could. I am not a huge huge Starbucks fan, but at 5:30 this morning...it was the best Starbucks ever!  lol.  It is in a Safeway, so you can also pick up some groceries.
