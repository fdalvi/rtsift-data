5 I go here for all my vitamin needs. Started going here when I found out I'm developing cancer. My doctor wanted me to start taking vitamins. The staff is friendly and attentive. Love going here because they carry coconut water by the cases. Best thing to drink ever. So much better than regular water and powerade.
3 Excellent, diverse selection of vitamins. Staff has classic vitamin/sales training, so take advice with grain of salt.  Consult someone who knows how to get your vitamins from real food first. However, sometimes you need vitamin support. For what the store is, they're excellent. Could be improved with more raw and whole food vitamin selections.
4 This place is close, clean, and customer friendly. The staff always speaks and offers assistance. The shelves are usually stocked with what I need. They are very well versed in nutrition and the products they offer. They seem to like it when I ask questions.   The Vitamin Shoppe has a free member card they use to send coupons and specials. Their prices and hours are reasonable too!  I'm glad The Vitamin Shoppe is in my area.
