3 I take my kiddos here regularly and I almost always get in and out with no hassle. They put notes in thier computer system of how we like our hair cuts so we don't ever have to explain it to someone new. There are a few toys in front to keep my 2 year old entertained and the staff is friendly.
5 Ask for David- he is very very good at color and cuts.  He's also good at listening to what you want to do with your hair and figuring out how to make you look good!  Call and ask for an appointment with him-- he books up fast because he's worth it.  Every friend I've referred to him says the same thing-  he's good!
5 Heather did a AMAZING job with my cut and color.  She was professional and friendly.  I will be coming back to her for sure.  I would recommend her to anyone!!  She listened to what I wanted and she keeps track of everything in the computer so when I want my color she knows what she did last time.    GO SEE HEATHER!  She was great!
5 Tried this location once again. Usually stylist cuts my hair so short that I have to wait a few weeks for it to grow out before I can do anything with it. The last time I went the stylist cut my hair shorter on one side than the other. I only went back because it was close to my house and I had a limited amount of time. This time was the charm. Melissa cut my hair and it looks fabulous. Just the right length on top and the back is as short as I wanted. I walked out of there looking great. If you want a great hair cut with a stylist who really listens to what you want then ask for Melissa.  She is fantastic.
