3 Aquarius struck me as selling an odd combination of stock at first. I had quickly scanned their sign on the front store saying "vintage", and when there was a lot of high end second hand suits designed for cocktail parties I was a bit thrown off.  Turns out I jumped to a half-awake conclusion and confused myself. They are in fact a Jack of all Trades second hand kind of store, selling a majority of clothing for well-to-do ladies. The odd cute brooch turns up in here for time to time, and on the last occasion I stopped by there was a wicker chair, fit for a king, sitting by their door.  They have a lot of faux Venetian glass bead jewellery at the moment, being sold at 2 for Â£8. The owner is very helpful and you often see locals popping in for a chat with her. They have a fetching vintage rail which is impressively packed with old fur coats from the 40s. Some of the fur is synthesied so you can rest easy knowing you're not buying a dead animal (sorry fashionistas, I'm not a fan of the real thing) but the coats are beautifully soft and still hold their former glamour.  Sequinned cocktail dresses geared towards stylish women in their 40s aren't really my thing. And in parts, some of the style offerings struck me as outdated. But if you're looking for a cheaper option for out of season high end fashion that's well-pressed and in good condition, then stop by for a look. It's open most days till five for your perusal.
