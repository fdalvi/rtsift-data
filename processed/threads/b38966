5 This is a truly allstar team that will take care of any and all software needs. They are also highly involved in the downtown community efforts and the team to work with in Vegas.
5 Raster Media did a fabulous job with my Dice Wisdom app.  Not only were they able to create exactly the product that I expected, they walked me through the process of my app being approved to be sold at the iTunes store! Did you know that you need a D&B number to even submit an app to iTunes? I didn't.  It was SO cool to actually see the app on my iPhone. After they did such a great job with the iPhone version, I had them also create an Android version. These people know what they're doing...and are especially adept at guiding someone who's not that tech savvy through the entire process.  Unlike other businesses that SAY they can create an app, it's mostly a cookie-cutter mobile landing site for your business address; they don't really know how to CREATE one..Raster Media did an incredibly wonderful job with mine!
5 Love them!!! They help in every thing in need!  They have done a wonderful job teaching and explaining. Everyone at Raster Media is so nice and helpful!! Total 5 stars!!
