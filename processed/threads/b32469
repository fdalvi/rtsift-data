5 Jodi Lynn is awesome! During our newborn pictures she was so patient and got the most amazing pictures. You can tell she loves what she does, and she's so good at it!
5 Jodi is truly one of the most amazing photographers to work with on a shoot! So far, my family and I have done four shoots with her: maternity, newborn, one-year-old, and Christmas photos. Each experience was spectacular. She is creative and patient. She has a great eye and vision. Her team is also amazing. I HIGHLY recommend her!
5 Jodi is awesome I hate having my picture taken but she makes you feel so comfortable and she knows all the right angles and lighting to put you in to make you look better than in real life. She did my maternity and new born photos and they exceeded my expectations!
5 Jodi has a most unique eye and wonderful style! I have used her now to do my daughter and my son's senior pictures as well as our family pictures. They were all so wonderful I had a hard time deciding which to choose!! She is professional, creative, always on time and exceeds your expectations always! I love working with her. Wouldn't use another photographer even if they were FREE! Thank you Jodi!
