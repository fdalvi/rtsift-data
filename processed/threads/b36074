4 I haven't even been to the store yet, but I was absolutely compelled to write a glowing review due to the very knowledgeable, enthusiastic and helpful sales associate, Manny, whom we reached when calling the store with questions about the different lines of luggage. I can only imagine that the experience in-store is even better!
4 Ridiculously expensive but great quality luggage. Had to get a specific piece for my boss, and when I called to check availability I was able to do everything via phone and email. Saved me a trip to caesars AND no sales tax since it was shipped out of state. Yay!  Manny and Di made it a super easy transaction
5 Love Junko. Such a great service.  Also really like Rimowa suitcases ...have a dozen of them...BUT! The salsa air is just not sturdy and is like a cheaply made toy. One just broke on a recent trip.   The fancy metal ones look great even when they are beaten up but the locks may come undone, and if the model is out of production, you are out of luck.    Bought a beautiful gold color metal suitcase in taipei..after a few trips, the locks got messed up, now the unit is out of production...in fact in a trip i had to have this suitcase shipped to me, and buy another unit..  Junko has helped me greatly with all these ...great communication, high professionalism.  I will always buy from her.
