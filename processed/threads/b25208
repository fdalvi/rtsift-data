2 I keep getting coupons from this outfit in the mail, so I finally clipped a couple & whipped over here to give it a try.  This Wienerschnitzel is nice inside, it was clean, & the service was good.  I had a Chili Dog, an Italian Sausage Dog, & fries.  Everything was hot, the fries were fresh & crispy, & it all tasted good.  "So, why the 2 Stars?" you ask?  I'm glad you asked that!  I brought a magazine to read as I ate, but I couldn't hear myself think because TWO big TVs were blasting out sports crap that I couldn't have been less interested in.  Also, the button on the bathroom sink would pop up right now, without the delay it's supposed to have, so I had to hold it down with one arm while trying to wash my other hand.  Hasn't anyone who works here ever noticed this problem?  Do the employees here ever wash their hands?  I'm just askin'.     :-O  2 Stars.
2 Took them 15 min to bring out 4 chili dogs and fries. Snail slow service. I honesty think the people working when I went in where high out of there minds. Should of went drive through.  I did give it another star because it was extremely clean inside and very cool
2 Stopped back in here today with a coupon for a free Chili Dog.  Just as before, they had TV, but at least this time it was turned down.  Also, just as before, the faucet in the bathroom is still out of order, & IT'S BEEN 8 MONTHS SINCE I WAS HERE LAST!  Otherwise, this place is nice inside & I have always liked the food.  They just either need to get a new manager here, or a new Maricopa County Health Inspector who will shut them down until you can wash your hands!     :-O
1 Tried it once and will never go back. Tried a chili dog and a burger. Was trying to give this first visit a fair shake but it's not going to happen. Food was terrible and service was below average. I'm hoping this place will shut down and FILIBERTO'S will take over the building.
