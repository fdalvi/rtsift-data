4 Pet Club has many selections that other more "common stores" do not. They have more varied brands of natural foods and supplements that my dogs absolutely love.   I first came in because I do like to support smaller and more local businesses. The staff is very friendly (not entirely as knowledgeable as I would like, but they will look things up and find out information for you). The store is clean, though a bit warehouse-like (I guess like any pet store).  The prices are slightly higher than I feel they should be, but they do have a "buy ten get one" on almost all products. So this eventually pays off pretty well.  I specifically like their natural medicine section here. It's quite varied and my dogs have gotten relief from the products. Mainly the "Natu-joint" liquid to be placed over food (high quality glucosamine) that got my dog walking again. If you have an older animal, or one with sore joints, come check out their medical section. First isle to the left ;).   Sign up for a pet card (They just write your name and file it and check off when you come in), and have a look around at the different products available here.
5 I only shop at Pet Club for my dog and cat. They only carry high quality pet food and treats, which I prefer over the big name pet foods. Their staff is knowledgable and friendly.  They also support local pet charities, which I very much appreciate.
