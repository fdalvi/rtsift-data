5 CHEAP EATS ALERT! On your way to the Chandler Mall for lunch? Why don't you skip the corporate food for a day and stop by Espo's (Espinoza's)? Located on the SE corner of Chandler and McClintock, Espo's Market has been anchored at this spot for decades.   Simple but hearty fare here. Personally, I go for the rellenos almost every time. But the tacos and burros are rock solid also.   Careful you don't get any sauce on that tie Scooter!
1 Food is to spicy for me.  Plus I hate that I have to go in the store to pay for my food if I forgot cash.
3 I think Espos has been there since the dawn of time.  I've eaten there off and on since the early 80s.  I went back today for the first time in probably 10 years.  The food is good and certainly plentiful for the price.  Today I ordered a carne asada burrito and and chimichanga.  Overall they were good but were in serious need of salt.  As always I found the salsa to be a little spicier than I prefer.  The guacamole was quite good.
