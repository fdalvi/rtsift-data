5 I travel for work and have had my eyelashes done in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Minneapolis, St. Louis, San Diego, Chicago etc.etc.etc. BEST application, not only did she use a variety of lash lengths to give the lashes a full and natural look, they have stayed on for 4 weeks! Lash applications have never lasted as long, or looked as good. I dont live in Las Vegas, but would fly there and back just to have my eyelashes done here again!  The new full set price was the cheapest I have ever paid, i typically pay between 200 - 300. Wink Lash was literally have the price and double the quality.
