5 I can't say enough good things about this business. We had a closet done about 9 years ago and part of the closet organization was swing down clothes bars. About 2 weeks ago one of the side assemblies broke making the bar unusable. I called Closet Factory and they could not have been any nicer about it. The new unit was ordered, came in about a week and was installed right away. Great company and they do stand behind their product.
5 I worked with Susan Peake at the Closet Factory last November and she designed a fabulous closet for me. I could not be happier. She asked a lot of questions, took measurements, and designed a closet that is exactly what I wanted and needed.
1 I contacted the Closet Factory last Monday to arrange for a new master closet design. I spoke to the owner, Abby.  She indicated she would have a designer contact me.  By Sunday with no contact, I left a message which prompted a call back from Abby today.  She informed me that it would take another week for a designer to get back to me, that they are scheduling installs the week prior to my completion date which means if I wait another week for a call then I couldn't make my completion, and if I want any hard wood it would take 5 to 6 weeks.  I asked if my only option was to wait for the one designer who has my "territory" and she said yes.  I guess she must be doing very well to turn away business.
