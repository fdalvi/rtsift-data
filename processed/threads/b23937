1 Having moved 15 times and having been referred to Classic Delivery- WHAT A NIGHTMARE.  VERY unprofessional and S L O W!!!!!!!  A move that should have taken no more than 6 hours stretched out to 10 hours.  The movers seemed to be strickly out of prison....just a TOTAL HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE.  Would DEFINATELY NOT RECOMMEND.
5 We had the best experience. The movers were super polite and friendly. The service impeccable. The cost reasonable.   The truck was well equipped , everything was wrapped in plastic then wrapped in blankets.  There wasn't a mark on anything. I cannot stress how impressed we were.  I give them my highest rating ,  They do book out about a week in advance so don't hesitate to call.  65 per hour.
5 As apart of our daily business, we value the workmanship of an Excellent Moving Company. We can always count on the guys to take care of our customers and their items. They are always prepared and extremely knowledgeable when it comes to moving the largest items in the tightest spaces! Whether or not the item is arriving to our store or being delivered to the buyer it is always wrapped for protection and safely stored on their truck for transport. We consistently recommend them daily and every time our customers come back letting us now how amazing their experience was!
