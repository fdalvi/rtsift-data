4 It may seem somewhat lacklustre to review a single chain of Domino's but I feel there's enough to say to justify it. Bear in mind then that the four stars here go for the quality of staff and service at this particular branch and do not necessarily reflect my opinion of the chain of restaurants as a whole. If you don't already like Domino's then this outlet isn't going to change your mind.  I know I'm certainly not alone in my love for a dirty takeaway pizza every now and then and I have to say that this Domino's really hits the spot. The orders are always cooked and ready on time and the staff generally know what they're doing. A good rule of thumb as to the quality of oft-frequented chains is how often they've gotten your order wrong. We've all experienced it, you ask for no mushrooms and somehow end up with the shiitake special - but never once here has my order been anything but exactly what I specified.  I'm not all too sure if this is a staple across all the Domino chain but you can get  a large pizza with any two toppings for Â£8 here and whilst that may be more expensive than the greasy takeaway a couple of doors down, it's easily enough to feed two people and it tastes pretty good too.  There's always a steady stream of staff flooding in and out of the doors into cars delivering takeaways so they're obviously pleasing some customers.  Whilst I certainly see the merit behind the argument that big chains kill competition blah blah blah, I feel happy in this case that I know there's a (relatively cheap) option close by for when I want to have a few mates round and get the pizzas in.  And they do 241 on Tuesdays on all pizzas - which is nice...
5 Surprised to find myself reviewing dominos....  The service is what has prompted me to! Matt is the best.
