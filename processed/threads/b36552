4 Wow, how amazing is it to get first review for a restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip?     :-))  Here we have Snack Nook!  This little place lives within the Casino Royale food court & features Noble Roman's Pizza, a Subway, & Snack Nook here, where just $1.99 brings you a hot dog with a tasty 13" weiner in an 11" bun, with help-yourself mustard, onions & relish.  I put on some mustard & then had them add chili for 89Â¢, & what you end up with is a great snack for $2.88!  There's a comfortable dining area too.     :-)  Speaking of dogs, are you a horndog single from say 35 to 99 in Vegas?  If so, whip which ever kind of doghood you have in here & plant it at the jumpin' Casino Royale bar for your great hookup with another like-minded tourist!  Hey, "What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas!"     :-))
3 What do you want from a foot long hot dog that costs $2?!? Decent taste for this skinny wiener. They actually make the meat look longer by putting it on a shorter bun. Good eats for low pricing, which is always a good thing in my book.  This place is located in the back of the Casino Royale. Walk through the drinking and smoking gamblers and get your grub.  If you are not eating inside the casino, you can ask for condiments to go, and they pack up your dogs really well in a plastic, clear bag for you.  if you do choose to dine in, you can have access to a fill it yourself drink service station, and many industrial size condiments.  If you are in Vegas, just stop and get one of these dogs to live in the time when Vegas kept multiple cheap eating spots to keep you happy, full and gambling!
4 $3 craps and $1.99 hot dog, nice way to spend a late Vegas night.  Located at the back of Casino Royal, this little gem serves up a bargain in New Vegas prices.  Great to put in the belly after a late night of Vegas.
