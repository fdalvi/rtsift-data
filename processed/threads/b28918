5 i received a leaflet under my door from Taj Express, and normally I just throw them away because I hate junk mail, but I hadn't had an Indian for ages and the temptation got the best of me and I am so glad it did!  Taj Express offer a wonderful, tasty curry at very respectable prices. I ordered a chicken balti, which was delicious and you get a generous serving. I also ordered naan bread which was cooked to perfection, and not too greasy, unlike most Indian restaurants.  What's more is that if you spend over Â£15 you get free delivery which is great, the delivery time was quite long at 40 minutes, but the quality of the food more than made up for this.
4 This small unassuming takeaway (there is a dining space however there are no facilities) produces some tasty Indian food and the portions are generous. I particularly like the tandoori chicken biryani (the chicken in this is cooked fresh when you order), though the curries are also flavorful, if fairly standard Indian fair.  In the area you can't go far wrong with Taj Express, the food is tasty and there is plenty of it.
