4 4 Stars because the Pasta Bowls truly ROCK!  This is not your dads Dominos Pizza, they have really changed.  The Sandwiches are good, the pasta bowls are killer and the pizza is MUCH better.  Service is pretty good as well.  The online ordering process is pretty cool.  It updates the status of your order from prep to baking to checking to delivery.  For delivery food you really cant beat it & I never thought I would say that about Dominos.  Good Job.
4 Consistently better over the past couple years. Hard to give any corporate pizza joint a 5 star rating, but they are definitely a good place to pick up some inexpensive eats.
1 I can't eat this pizza again. It was overdone and the sauce was not very good. Service was great though.
