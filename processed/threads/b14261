4 Nice staff and store, however the wait time for prescriptions in the drive thru can be a little long. I think it's probably a good idea to go in and pick up.   They also have a Redbox and good deals and wine!
1 This company is about three time as expensive as Walmart; I also have a prescription that is supposed to be filled on the third of each month. Last month I picked up my prescription four days late so now this month as I am out of medication they will not refill my prescription until the eight of the month. I am going to have to call my doctors office to get a new prescription and have it filled at Walmart (where I should be doing my business anyways). Next month I will be out of town for five days when the prescription needs to be picked up and I am confident that Walmart will not deliver such poor service at such high rates.
1 Don't ever come here.  Because no one works here. You will wait 30mins if you need something. If you see don't stop go to the next one please. Don't say I didn't warn you
