3 Noticed this place last week when i was in the area on biz - hmmmm- add this to the list.  tonite, after dropping SO off at work, gotta hit the old bar for some biz - not fun. afterwards, decided, i'm in the NE area of vegas, gotta get back to the westside, i'm in a shit mood. it's dinner time, i'm hitting up a few places on the way back - 1st stop, Catfish Alley.  Before my drive by last week, never seen or heard of the place.  basically, southern style food - catfish ( really ? ) fried chicken, fried shrimp, hot links ( they were out of the links ...damn ! ), fried oysters.  sides included okra, slaw, p. salad, fried green beans, corn nuggets, baked beans, etc  i ordered the 3 pc catfish w/ fries.  a side of potato salad. ordered some fried mac n cheese bites.  I asked if they had fried diet coke ( get it ?  she didn't ! )  wound up making 3 more stops before i made it home to try the fish. it was kinda funny - they included cole slaw in a bag ( if i knew that, i would've skipped the p. salad ( i was told it was homemade - coulda fooled me ! ) the fish - top notch !  light, crispy, moist ...coulda used some more tartar sauce ( not a biggie since i'm leaving the other 2 pcs for my girl and she doesn't like tartar sauce ), fries dull, slaw - mushy - most likely due to the delay in getting home with it ( i'll give them the benefit of the doubt )  the m&c bites - after 2 ...nope - no good - might like it better as bar food after a couple beers - maybe.  total cost $14 ...the catfish is tasty - the place is called catfish alley - stick to the catfish !!
5 Best dang AMERICAN STYLE SOUTHERN FRIED catfish I have ever had!!!  I came here about a year ago with some friends and everytime we come to las vegas we make it a point to stop at CATFISH ALLEY. Lemme break it down GOOD:  CATFISH-Very light and crunchy without being greasy, YES I SAID IT "WITHOUT BEING GREASY!!!" Incredible!!!  Also get the spicy version because its not really that spicy at all, and I think the flavor kicks a bit more actually.  FRIED CORN NUGGETS-Think Lawrys corn in a batter and deep fried.  EXCELLENT side order!  But it is not available as a side order to come with the catfish, you have to order it as a whole order. :(  Corn on the cob-So fresh and so clean.  Just add butter and enjoy.  Baked Potato, Potato Salad, Seasoned Fries all are very nice according to my friends.  As for me, I order the 3 piece catfish dinner (SPICY!) with baked potato and corn on the cob. If I go with friends I will also order the CORN NUGGETS. 1 order of nuggets will easily satisfy 3-4 people.  As for anything else on the menu, ive also tried the FRIED CHICKEN. But the SOUTHERN STYLE FRIED CATFISH, is where its at.  Take care and enjoy your food.
4 Rachel M. mentioned she heard some great things about Catfish Alley, so we had to check it out for ourselves.  This 2 year old casual restaurant is immaculate.  That's the first thing we noticed is how clean and orderly everything looked.  We stood at the counter for awhile as we decided what to order.  The guy working the register was friendly and super helpful.  He suggested we go for the "4 Pc. Fish Dinner with 2 Sides" ($10.99), so we did.  Our choice of sides were okra and greens.  (Other sides include french fries, cole slaw, baked beans, and potato salad.)  We were also intrigued by the Mac & Cheese Bites for $3.75.  We chose a booth to sit at as we waited for our order.  It was soon to arrive and we dug right in.  The catfish had a great coating that had lots of flavor and stayed crispy, keeping the fish moist inside.  It wasn't greasy at all, just like B.K. said.  The hush puppies that came with it too were pretty good as well.  I was really impressed with the Mac & Cheese Bites though.  It was the first time I had these and they were such a nice treat.  (I'm sure every kid would love these deep-fried macaroni and cheese goodies!)  We were also lucky to try out their Fried Green Beans and Corn Nuggets.  The deep-fried string beans were tasty too, with a good crunch.  The Big F loved the Corn Nuggets though.  It's like cream of corn that's been deep-fried, almost like a dessert.    The Big F was craving for more fish, so he ordered another two!  ($2/each extra pc. fish)  I would recommend eating in because things always taste better right when they come out of the fryer!  They do serve individual size bottles of wine if you're feeling fancy!  Sidenote:  The ladies' restroom only had hot water in there...and I do mean scalding hot water.  Not sure if it's been fixed or not, but watch out!  (You know I got pictures of our Southern grub!  Check them out!)
5 This place just couldn't be any more consistent, clean or great.  I've come back about six times since my first review.  It's just spotless -- and I really appreciate that.    But it's really about the food.  It's just great.  Seriously, if you're homesick for Southern food -- greens, hushpuppies and zero-grease catfish that doesn't taste muddy, this is it.   I don't know how they do it -- it's just delicious.  Did I mention that the corn fritters rock.    For lunch, this is a great find.  I can't ever clean my plastic plate -- 2 piece special that comes with 2 sides.  I usually get double greens and couldn't be happier.  If I've got a guest with me, I'll splurge and we'll split either the fried green beans or the corn nuggets (they're back).   Never can clean my plate --and that's just fine.    Seriously -- if you're on the east side, this place is just wonderful.
4 This place is off the path from all you strip loving folks, but this is definitely something that you should try. This place has THE best fried spicy catfish(not spicy at all) and CORN NUGGETS! the folks there are super friendly, making sure that your visit there is pleasant (they personally check on you at your table, and always with a smile). The place is also very clean and organized, with a lot of room between tables.  This is definitely a Vegas hidden gem.
5 I had never heard of this place until I ran across it here on Yelp and all the reviews were positive. B.K.'s review really had me ready to go.  Well it was everything promised. Terrific melt in your mouth catfish, crispy and mosit hush puppies and did I mention it was CHEAP!! $5 for 2 fish & fries.  Next time I will have to order alot more it was so good I had to share.  The place was comfortable and relaxed with smiling faces, plus great food I can't wait to go back
4 I just went here for the 1st time a week ago but I had to go back & get some more of that catfish so I did.   Well being highly medicated I ordered a Family 8pc catfish cajun-style  w/hushpuppies and 2 sides(baked beans & fried okra), plus mac n cheese bites.   The catfish once again was outstanding, as were the hushpuppies but I was a little disappointed with the rest which is why I've deducted 1 star.   Granted it was take out and I didn't get to eat it hot & fresh. The mac N cheese bites were not impressive at all. The okra looked real tasty but didn't make it home crunchy.The beans were just beans,probably canned.   I really like this place, the owners run it and its very homey.
5 This is THE best catfish spot west of the Rockies.  I ate here 3 times in a span of about 7 days, it was that good.  The spicy (which means seasoned, not hot) catfish is the way to go. Add your own Tabasco to bring up the heat.  Lovely filets crusted in a corn meal/flour mix fried to perfection.  The corn nuggets, battered fried green beans with ranch dressing, mac n cheese balls and the hush puppies are the top side dishes.  They even have Dr. Pepper (but not in the fountain, so be sure to ask) and sweet tea.  The owner and his staff are absolutely the nicest people.  I can't wait to go back!
4 My wife and I eat some kind of fried food every 1st Friday of the month so we came here after reading so many great reviews.   Totally worth it.    We started off with the sampler which came with 3 pieces of catfish, 2 pieces of shrimp and chicken fingers which we inhaled in about 10 minutes.  Ended up ordering another helping of fingers and catfish along with a pitcher of beer and we were in fried food heaven.    I did wish the "spicy" catfish was actually spicy but that's a very minor thing.  My wife actually liked the chicken more than the fish.  Staff was fantastic.
5 I have been coming here ever since they opened and they absolutely have the most amazing fried catfish (west) of the mississippi. I don't know how they do it, but the fish always- and I mean ALWAYS- comes piping hot, perfectly crisp outside, perfectly moist inside and DRY- without a hint of grease. Amazing. It's as if they were baked! I don't recommend "taking out" as it's best to have them straight from their fryer to your table. Nice sides to try are their fried mac and cheese bites (have them hot), fried okra, collard greens, and my favorite, their fried green beans. They serve the perfect hot sauce to accompany (Frank's) and a tartar sauce that I never consume because I love their hot sauce. Order the fish "spicy" which isn't hot but rather, "spiced" with Cajun seasonings. I also like to order an 18-pc. (catfish only) to take home and make fish tacos with. The orders always come with hush puppies that are delicious hot too (though I'm not really a fan). The staff are always welcoming and pleasant and the place is very clean- a favorite of the lunchtime crowd. They also have 2 flat screens on the walls and drink fountains. If you're looking for catfish done amazing, this is the place in Vegas to head to.
4 They have a two piece catfish special with fries and hush puppies for $5.00 and it is great value for your money. I tried the fried okra and it was yummy. This is a mom and pop business and you can tell because the people that work here are friendly and eager to serve you. I love supporting places like this. I wish them all the success in the world. Hopefully, with my support.
5 The BEST fried catfish, ever. I can't imagine it getting any better than this. Crisp, light, perfect cornmeal coating. I ate every tiny speck on my plate. Home made tartar sauce. Some of the best french fries I've ever had -- crispy, perfect! And the greens were like crack. I could eat those greens every day. I wish they sold them by the pound.  I need to go back and try more sides.
4 I live very close to this restaurant and I don't go there as much as I really should.  These are very, very nice people and the food is good and reminds me of my time spent in the south.  The menus IS predominantly fried food, which is a little heavy, but this is really comfort food to the max.  Fried okra, catfish, all very, very good.  Crispyness to the max and great texture, but NOT greasy.  Easy access, lots of parking, family owned and very family friendly.
5 When asked, "what did you do in Vegas?" I say, i went to church.. or more like i went to brunch after church. Catfish Alley's patrons all seem to be good wholesome Southerners who just got out of church and are now being further rewarded with delicious food.  We had wings, so delicious so crispy and not oily. Fried catfish, everyone seems to hit it on the spot. not overly coated with corn meal, cooked up light and crunch, moist on the inside. the sides were good fried okra being the highlight but the other sides i had was average. It's good but it's average.  The star of the meal, chicken fried steak. This is getting the title, Best I've ever ate! This is one dish i try everywhere i get a chance and it's head and shoulders above everyone else. I don't even know how to describe the crust. It's soft but yet it's flaky, crunchy, crispy.. how can i describe it? I really don't know but what i do know it's the best I've ever had.  The only thing i didn't like, Where is the dam kool-aid? We had a talk with the boss and we've come to an agreement. next time I'm in there i better get my kool-aid.  With that matter addressed, this will be a routine stop for us when we're in town, even if i have to walk there myself.
4 I drove by this place probably a couple thousand times :). Stopped by for a quick lunch few days ago and tried a Cajun catfish plate with yams fires on a side. Fish was great and yams fries were great too. I'm a fan!
5 Soooo sad...their number is disconnected and they're closed... This is really a terrible shame.
4 This place took me by surprise. I was yelping around looking for a different place to eat and driving east of Flamingo in hopes of finding a spot. Then I asked Yelp to search for a nearby restaurants and it pointed to Catfish Alley. I read the reviews and then drove right to it. This place was perfect! You have to order your food at a counter. The people there are really nice. The food is not cheap, but its very good! I wish I could come her as often as possible but I have two issues. I am trying to lose weight and fried catfish and delicious carbs are not a good mix.  I tried the fried green beans, the baked beans, and they ran out of the fried macaroni bites. I loved everything.   I wasn't so sure if the catfish was going to be that good. It was expensive and I didnt want to pay for it. But when it came out, it was hot and very tasty! No bones. Just delicious catfish flavor.  You should definityly try it. I brought Herbie and herbie liked playing with the fish tank they had there with huge fish swimming around.
3 Is this place still open??? drove by a cpl weeks ago and it was all boarded up!!!
4 Found this place through Yelp and so glad I did! I now have another work lunch destination.  I ordered the 2 fillets/2 sides combo. With the two delicious catfish pieces, I chose fried okra and sweet potato fries. The catfish is on par with Lazy Joe's Fish N Chips. I'm not sure which I like better. They are breaded differently and both have their own merits. I'm always down for fried okra and theirs were as good as I had hoped. The sweet potato fries did not disappoint either. I'm not a big fan of hush puppies, but two of those came with the meal also.  I will definitely be back. There is a plethora of items on their menu I want to try. Specifically, I'd like to try their gumbo and a couple of their other side dishes.
4 Decided I have to find some decent soul food around town so I made the trip here.  I went for the Big Catch dinner, but the guy at the counter was thoughtful enough to advise me of the bone content and steered me to the four piece dinner.  The catfish was nice and crisp, although I wish the actual pieces were bigger so I could get more of that catfish flavor.  The greens were awesomely deliciously, a little spicy even.  Mac and cheese also did not disappoint.  They should move the ice tea machine so that it's next to the soda machine; I filled my cup up with tea, then ice, and of course received some splashback.
5 Had lunch here today, very good catfish had the spicy which is not spicy hot , but flavorful spicy, I reviewed hush puppies restaurant earlier , and said that was the best catfish that I ever had , they might be but w/o a side by side taste test I could not be sure , all I know now, is that I got more options for catfish:)  all the sides, we had were really good(fries,blk eye peas,Cole slaw, collard green , mac n cheese, fried okra, and hush puppies)  we also had the shrimp. the shrimp were alright nothing special , the catfish is the star here . Have to try the fried oysters the next time, yes there will b a next time . Service was very friendly.
4 I'm not 100% on the catfish... maybe because I'm not the biggest catfish fan, but the sides are absolutely amazing (except the store bought fries).    The first time I tried this place I got the lunch special w/sides ... I was so impressed with the black eyed peas that I went back and ordered more.   Seriously go here for the sides. The greens are amazing. When we bar-b-que at home we will go here and order a bunch of large sides to go with our dinner.
2 Only thing good about this place is customer service.
4 I had the both the regular and spicy catfish. Spicy is the best if you like a little kick. You will NOT need the hotsauce. The hushpuppies, baked beans, and collard greens handsdown the best I have had in Vegas. Not a fan of the mac n cheese. It seemed like the Kraft version...I was looking for the southern homemade style mac n cheese.   The owners are from MS and have the fish flown in fresh from the MS Delta so you are getting the real deal when you eat there. Overall, I felt like I was at home enjoying my southern roots while eating at Catfish Alley. Its like being in your favorite hole-in-the-wall but with a more trendy spin.
4 After having read great reviews on Yelp and being that Catfish Alley is very close to my house, I made a stop for a quick dinner pick-up.  It's a small and modest-looking joint, but the mom & pop atmosphere only adds to the down-to-earth warmth of the place.  The cashier lady who took our order was very sweet.  I was impressed to see a Best Of Vegas's Seafood Restaurant 2010 award on their wall.  We ordered the 4 pieces + 2 sides and it was the right amount of food for two people.  The catfish pieces were a good size, the breading was flavorful and not too greasy.  We ordered both regular and spicy breading, I preferred the spicy, it was perfectly complimentary with their Firecracker sauce made in house.    I also really enjoyed the hush puppies, and I'm not usually a fan of them.  The sweet potato fries were a little less sweet than other restaurants, and after some contemplation I've decided I like them a little sweeter.  Next time I'm definitely trying the fried okra and fried green beans.    Like all good southern food, Catfish Alley is probably not good for your diet but so good for your soul!
5 I'm from Mississippi and I know catfish. This place has Mississippi catfish with a New Orleans spice. The greens are awesome and now they have black eyed peas. Nice to have so close to the house.
4 Ive only been here once but I'd been dying to go for weeks. One night we set out to go only to find out our GPS guided us to the Flamingo location which is now closed. ... thanks Garmin. We called and confirmed yup. closed. the only location in town is on Bermuda/Silverado Ranch - not just "silverado" as yelp has it listed.   FOOD: I went w/ the spicy catfish 2 piece - with 2 sides - I went with coleslaw and sweet potato fries. the whole plate was freakin delish. NOTE: the spicy catfish is not spicy at all. not even a hint of spice. not even a dash of spice. or a hue of a dash of a hint of spice. So feel free to order spicy or non spicy and it will be the same. BUT DELICIOUS it was.. gotta say that was damn good. It was exactly as I imagined it tasting. wonderful. perfectly breaded. 2 (kinda small) hushpuppies. swee Potato fries were on point. They also came with their own in house made tartar sauce (which i dont eat b/c i dont eat onions) and their own homemade hot sauce. I poured every drip of that on my food and added Hot sauce b/c it was so good.   SERVICE: it was great. kinda empty in there @ the time b/c I think it was early like 630p on a saturday night. (yeah im old I needed to eat early) give me that blue plate special! j/k The staff checked on us several times and she gave me 3 pieces instead of 2. and gave my bf 4 instead of 3. Kinda pricey for the amt of food you get - $25.00 for a 2 and 3 piece.. eh... I'd go back but when my wallet and most importantly my calories allow for it..
4 Ate there last night and it can best be summed up with.. OMG, that's GOOD!  Hubby got the spicy catfish and loved their homemade hot sauce on it, said the two went together well.  His sides were the cole slaw (yummy) and the baked beans (meh).  I got the regular catfish and my two sides were the greens (nom) and the fried okra (nom!).  We each ordered the two piece dinner and we each got 3 pieces.. even after I commented, when ordering, that I could only eat one piece so hubby should order one less than he wants 'cause he was getting my extra one.  So.. I ate 1 piece, hubby ate 4, one too many.  Breading was nicely spiced on each, the catfish was fantastic.  Hubby was curious about their appetizers so I told him to go ahead and order 1.. he ordered two, and there were huge quantities of both.  The mac & cheese balls (fried) and the sweet corn balls (fried).  Let me say this, with the fried catfish and fried okra, I was thinking that more fried foods would put me into a coma... but they were both fantastic!  Breading on both was very minimal, and they were incredibly good.  The sweet corn balls had extra honey in them, they should be classified as a dessert.  Only drawbacks.. baked beans were boring, not much flavor difference from a can of pork & beans from the grocery shelf.  Then there was their tartar sauce.. it was homemade and very good, but you get a very tiny quantity of it served with the order, making a request for more tartar sauce obligatory.  When we were leaving, after bemoaning the fact that they're such a long drive from our house, we got informed that they're opening up another location this summer near our house.. I'd have hugged the guy for that info if I wasn't already slipping into my fried-food coma.  Look for them opening sometime this summer at the NW corner of Craig & Decatur! :D
5 Gotta come here.  Gotta try EVERYTHING which means you gotta go back!  I love this place, its not greasy.  The greens are a bit overdone, but that's my only criticism!  I loved the sweet potatoe fries, the okra, the black-eyed beans (or in our world, they are just called ...Peas) and everything!  Must go back for the briskit....more to come!
2 I loved Catfish Alley, I thought I was glad it was by my home and Job!   It was good, but not worth $30.00 for two 3 piece and fries and a side order of corn bites. The spicy was too salty, whew!  The plain was more like it.  If we had ate there, I would have had them give me the plain, it was that salty!   I think I will fry my own fish next time.
4 Great food, wonderful service.  A little joint that concentrates on quality food and personable service. Best fried chicken I've had in Vegas, crispy light coating, hot and fresh tasting.
5 **Summary**        - Best fried catfish in town hands down. The breading is flavorlicious and knows no equal. **Price**        - $10.00 for lunch **Ordered**        - 2 Pc. Fish Dinner w/ Fried Okra & French Fries               - Catfish - Perfectly spiced cornbread breading                - Fried Okra - A little on the bland side compared to the catfish. I prefer Church's. **Recommendations**        - One to add to the bucket list if you've never been here.
4 Can I say what a lovely little hidden gem this place is?? I've never had "authentic" southern food before, but if it's anything like this I would eat it all the time.   Their catfish is awesome! They bread it with what looks like cornmeal which makes it extremely crispy without it being overly greasy or heavy! I had like 3 pieces of the fish and I didn't have that bloated gross feeling you usually get after eating a lot of fried food.   Their fried okra is also extremely fresh and made perfectly. I definitely want to return and try their corn nuggets!
5 The place has a very "at-home" feeling to it. I like how they played some jazz music--it felt kind of relaxing. The people there were super nice and friendly. The lady at the counter and her son checked up on us and all the others dining there to make sure all was well. As far as the food, here's what we had: -4 pc. Catfish w/ two sides(Mac and cheese and fried okra) for 14.99 and an extra fish for 2.50- Believe me when I say that this is probably the best catfish I've ever had..no joke. The batter was just right, not too thick and perfectly seasoned. The fish was very moist and the pieces were pretty big. It came w tartar sauce and what seemed like a sweet and sour sauce? Not sure but that was pretty ok. The Mac and cheese was good. Not the best one I've had but the guy loved it..and he's picky when it comes to the mac and cheese. I have to say though that the fried okra was alright..a little bit on the bland side. -Gumbo- I must say that I am a fan even though i only tried a little bit of it fearing I would accidentally eat the meat. The guy on the other hand found it to be "okay" stating that it was "too thick." Didnt know what his deal was but I liked it! -Hush puppies- Before coming here, I hated hush puppies with a passion.In fact I told myself I'll never eat it again(bad experience). The bf insisted I try it stating that it was "real good" and he wasnt lying. These are probably the only hush puppies I will ever eat--crunchy on the outside and soft and tasty inside.  -Cornbread/sweetened green tea- we finished off with some delicious and perfectly moist cornbread for only 25 cents a piece! Washed it down with green tea, which was sweetened to perfection!  We ended up paying close to 30 bucks which wasn't so bad. Many think it's a wee pricey but I thought the portions are decent for the price. Overall a must go-to-again place!
2 Very pricey for a take out place. The staff was nice seemed like a family run business. Im a old fan of the Hush Puppy restaraunt and there you get all you can eat for less than their 4 piece. I dont know what they use to bread the fish with (It may be pork rinds) but it wasnt all that flavorful. The fish was dry. The slaw was good as were the hush puppies. Their 'homemade" desserts were made at a bakery according to the kid at the counter. It seemed like they had more than enough help so they put one of the sons out to oversee the dining room and since there are only a handful of diners he spent a lot of time "hovering" over our table. I wont be going back
2 Food tasted really good.  But disappointed at the quantity for the price.  Catfish was crispy and soft at the same time.  The bbq brisket was tender and the sauce delicious with a nice mild spiciness.
5 Best catfish I've had. Definitely a fan of the cajun seasoning. I've yet to eat anythng here thatisn't great. Authentic Southern dishes and service. There is a wait, but this is due to the food being made to order. I'm always great with waiting if it means that I am getting fresh food. The atmosphere is very welcoming.
4 Great catfish here. Cajun seasoning is THE BOMB. My mistake for eating with my eyes because I thought 1 piece wouldn't be enough for me so I chose the 2 pieces 2 side deal. I was so wrong. One piece did the job for me, and I think it's because of the thick fillet. The catfish was meaty. Catfish had a nice, crispy, corn meal breading around it with a nice tender catfish fillet. I got the mac and cheese as a side and the corn on the cob. Both delicious. I also tried the fried okra. I'm not a big fan of okra, but the breading on that fried okra was a great combo. I tore that okra up!   $9.99 deal. I call that a freaking steal! (hee hee that rhymed)
2 Waited 30 min for some barely warm overcooked bland catfish "jerky" with some lukewarm french fries and collard greens.  2 piece fish and 2 sides cost us 9.99 and the portion sizes were that of a grade school cafeteria.  The seasoned fries were not fresh - frozen and the collard greens were definitely from a can...  Long story short - we will not eat here again and will not recommend anyone else does either.
4 Very cool little place and the staff was friendly.  Others have commented on the price but I think it's fair based on you what you get portion and freshness wise.  I'll be back for sure.
5 I will keep it honest about this place.  They know how to run a business.  I have been a fan ever since they were at the old spot on Flamingo and Eastern.  Know why they have been running great for 4 years?:  Unlike a lot of black businesses, they cater and are friendly to ALL people, as if they were all family, and dont maintain an intimidating ambience about their business.  They dont go to the same area of town as the others (Westside/NLV) going to the a-typical areas of town for black businesses shows they know how to market themselves.   The catfish is seasoned just right,i literally could eat it all day (Miss the Ayce from the old spot though.lol)   The sides excellent,especially the greens,the okra, and the baked beans.  Fresh well prepared deserts.   Even the non fish items (chicken wings,etc) are tasty.  Everyone would do themselves a favor and go here....bring your whole family.
1 Slow service and not very inviting. Fish was mushy and the beans were just from a can of pork n beans. Will not return.
2 The catfish is ok, but not any better than you will find at any Las Vegas buffet.  The fish batter was chewy...I've never had chewy fish batter.   Sides were very good and I liked the mom and pop atmosphere.  I love fried catfish, but I don't like the fish here.
4 Wonderful, fresh and tasty.  Snappy crust with the most tender, flaky catfish meat inside.  I've never had it this good!  The catfish tasted fresh as it can get, the hush puppy sides were flavorful (unlike the ones you get from chains like Long John Silvers).    Maybe the few people that complained were at a different place in the neighborhood that serves catfish, because chewy, rubbery  'jerky' style is exactly what the competitors have.  I have a feeling that the collard greens and black eyed peas were from a can, but  I may be wrong on that.  They tasted good, but not like they were freshly picked.
5 How come the yelp map has the location on the opposite corner, in the middle of a vacant lot?  I waited and waited and finally a bus came.  Seriously, the food here is really quite good for its purpose. Base prices have been reduced about 15% in response to previous concerns about menu cost.  The catfish was as good as farm-raised cat can be. Even my wife, a tougher critic than me, praised the flavor of the meat and the savory breading.    Until some joint opens offering river-caught two pounders as the menu leader, this place will do just fine.
5 Jeez if only yelp had a way to send smells over the interweb. A-mazing =) note to self tuesdays 4.99 - 2pc fish and side
5 Catfish Alley is thee bomb! Food is delicious and customer service is great.
1 Macaroni ain't no good, taste like wood. I usually wait about a week or two to yelp but this place....is a scam.  I can not believe that they just served me Van de Kamp shrimp and pre frozen catfish. Im upset, because I came to Vegas and wasted money and it wasnt on a slot machine. Jesus the mac and cheese, KRAFT MACARONI, really?   Do yourself a favor and skip this place, no wonder my guest and I were the only people here. I choose to skip mentioning the Kroger brand hush puppies on purpose.
5 I never had fried catfish and liked it. My friend swears by this place and forced me to try it. I loved it. It is fast, cheap and tasty. I actually liked catfish. I liked the greens and the mac n cheese. It was comfort food. No frills. Not extravagant. Home cooking southern soal food. The service was friendly too. The place is a basic, small local food joint with minimum decorations. Affordable and fast.
