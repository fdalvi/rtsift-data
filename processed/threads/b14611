5 this place is not closed. we just used them to buy a new house this month. i used the gray team to purchase my first home in AZ. then my girlfriend used them to sell her home in AZ. now we are using them again to buy our first home together.   kendra and jon are extremely helpful and honest. they have a talent in helping you figure out what home best suits you and most important, your budget. available all hours of all days, they are quick to return calls, calm buyers and sellers anxiety, and bring up issues that you may not be privvy to. extremely professional but also friendly and they treat you like you've known each other for years.   and to top it off, jon is a contractor so he is able to point out flaws in a home if there are any.   both of these agents are motivated and inspired to help out their clients. we will use them again and again and use any opportunity to pass along our great experiences to other prospective buyers and/or sellers. thanks kendra and jon!
5 This place gets 5 plus stars. JR is the man!! When he helped us sell our home in PHX, a 5 year nightmare came to an end. We stopped paying 4 bills and a Hugh cross county burden! Thank you USA WEST!
5 Thanks All!  We appreciate your support.   As always, call Jon at 480-272-1470 for incredible service!
1 I disagree with your practice of dropping flyers door-to-door that agents from West USA Realty use to advertise.  It's basically just garbage that we must pick up and throw away.  Plus, it serves to pile up on the front door when we go on vacation to indicate to the criminal element that no one is home.  My front door is my private property and not a tool for you doing your business.  Please don't drop your garbage flyers on my door.
