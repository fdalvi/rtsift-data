5 I brought my kids in to see Rob for the acne they get from their sweaty helmets. Dr. Rob knew exactly what to tell my boys so they would take care of their skin and use what he gave them. I really don't want them to get acne scars so treating it was really important to me. Thanks Rob!
5 Dr. Rob is great!!  He was able to get my sister in to see him (she was visiting from out of town) at the last minute and was able to diagnose her problem in less than a minute.  She has already felt relief in less than 3 hours and we are so grateful.  His staff is super friendly and professional.  So glad that they are close by!!  Thanks Rob!!!
5 I was in Scottsdale on vacation and needed to get to a dermatologist fast.  The SCC of Scottsdale was very accommodating, professional and friendly.  Rob and his staff made time to see me in their schedule and saved my vacation.  Thank you so much!!!
