4 I have been driving past their pumpkin patch for years and finally went this past October. Three times! The first time, I stopped by to do a price comparison. I needed mini pumpkins for a charity event I was doing. The second time, I went with my family and we enjoyed taking pictures and picked up several pumpkins...I think we spent $10. The third time I bought a bunch of mini pumpkins for that charity event, because at 50 cents each, it was the best price I found. I like it because it's not overly crowded, but they have an array of sizes and shapes of pumpkins. it's neat and orderly and the prices are very good.   The volunteers are very nice and helpful. They have various wagons to help you shop & carry your pumpkins to your car. They also have decorated it very festively and have photo areas set up with hay stacks and cut-out photo spots. You get a pumpkin sticker and color pages as well with your purchase.  For tired parents, who don't want to make a whole day event of pumpkin patch-ing, this is a cozy place to go in & out, and still get that classic pumpkin patch photo you've always wanted.
5 I am the Pastor of Epiphany.  I sent the reviewer from 9/29/12 a response via Yelp! a couple of weeks after she visited apologizing for her unfortunate experience.  A church service is the last place that someone should feel unwelcome.  Epiphany is not a perfect church, but 4 out of 5 guests have a positive experience.  We do take feedback seriously and endeavor to give that fifth guest a better experience next time.
3 Came here for a training, enjoyed the church, but too bad that there's no Wi-Fi service.  That could improve the use of the church.
