5 Great massage every time!  I'm a regular client at D-Stress Zone and have two regular therapists, Sari and Wendy. I also see Karen sometimes and have seen other therapists over the years when they weren't available. I've never received a less than excellent massage no matter who I've seen.  Check them out. You'll be glad you did.
5 Such a great place to go and unwind. Your first time get you get an extra 30 minutes free for a massage. I emailed them at the end of the day at 4:30pm and they called me back right away and were able to get me in that evening. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend this place.
