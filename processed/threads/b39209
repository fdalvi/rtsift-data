4 This is our favorite Circle K.    Large convenience store with a variety of fresh grab and go breakfast and lunch items.  Lots of Slurpie flavors (although I will note that more often than not, many of the flavors are unavailable when we stop in due to freeze thaw cycle).  Gas pumps.  Cold drinks.    I guess that it pretty much is an average run of the mill convenience store except for the fact that they have AMAZING customer service.  They are always friendly and helpful.  Never had a bad experience.  Although I wish that all of the Slurpie machines were available to use more often.
3 Clean location and efficient staff. Coffee always seems to be available, haven't encountered a creamer out yet.  Cup dispensers are full.  Just seems like they've got it together here.
1 I am not pleased. My friend bought me a cheeseburger from this location, and something was definitely wrong with it. Strange texture, I think it may have been really old or something. I didn't eat a lot of it, but that night, I felt dizzy and my stomach had sharp pains. I still feel pains in both my sides from that damn cheeseburger. NOT going to this location (or any Circle K if I can help it) again! Stomach infection = not worth it.
5 I like this Circle K the best because of the friendly staff that works here and also because they always keep the store clean and well-stocked. The location is perfect as well.   The ONLY thing I think this store lacks is a car wash.
