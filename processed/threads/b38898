5 GREAT new location!  I am amazed how many Starbucks are in the Scottsdale area but here's another one!  The new one has a great layout with a good number of indoor seats.  It also has a drive through which is super convenient!  The drinks are made well, which I have come to expect from Starbucks and the baristas are helpful!
4 Great new location, definitely a plus for the neighborhood.  Fast service, friendly staff, and great drink.  Can't beat it on a summer day like this.
3 The food and beverages are always predictably good, the staff are always predictably friendly, and the seating is very much adequate. My only complaint, otherwise I'd give 4 or 5 stars, is the Internet access is super flaky. I'd come here to work but after far too many lost VPN connections there is absolutely no way I could trust this Wi-Fi service with my job duties. (In fact, I had to post this with the PotBelly WiFi because the Starbucks connection went down while logging into yelp.)
