1 My boyfriend and I went here to grab a breakfast sandwich because the cafe at our hotel was packed! So we went to subway at the plaza, we both ordered the western egg and cheese, this was the most frustrating subway expierence EVER!!!! This woman could not make sandwich for her life, i wanted to walk out half way thru her making it! Let's just put it this way, when we got our sandwiches, they were barely warm and she put so much salt and pepper that's all we could taste. Never again, we should of gone to mcdonald's!
2 My friend got a tuna sandwich from here and after he ate it didn't feel so hot. Being wise and knowledgeable I knew better then to eat at this place. Sure glad I didnt have a sandwich. Fremont street sucks.
1 Line was almost 15 people deep and they had ONE employee working. ONE.   I didn't even attempt to wait
1 Bad attitude!
