5 I am a long time patient of Dr. Gallimore and besides being a very skilled dentist, he is very friendly, as is his staff.  I had an implant done at Nevada Oral and Facial Surgery and he was responsible for putting the fake tooth (Crown) in.  Everything went great and I have never had any problems with it.  When I first started going to Dr. Gallimore, what initially drew me to him was his high quality dental work at very reasonable prices.  To this day he still has very reasonable prices and takes many insurances.  My whole family and several friends and co-workers go to him as well and I would not take my family to anyone else.  There are some very scary dentists in this town and you should especially watch out for the dentists in Las Vegas who advertise super low rates on cleanings and pulling of (wisdom) teeth.
5 Dr. Gallimore of www.702-DENTIST.com is one of the best, most experienced cosmetic dentists in Las Vegas and his staff is very friendly and makes you feel at ease.  All of my family and many of our friends and co-workers also go to Dr. Gallimore.  Being open on Saturday in Las Vegas is a BIG PLUS because I don't like to miss work during the week if at all possible or if their is a dental emergency over the weekend with one of the kids.  Their dental prices are very reasonable, they took my insurance and they have many financing options if you need to finance.  THE MOST IMPORTANT ITEM, DR. GALLIMORE IS VERY HONEST AND TRUSTWORTHY.  He does what is best for the patient and what is the most cost effective.  He does not try to push root canals like some dentists do.  You can tell he is a very decent and compassionate man.  Oh yeah, did I mention that they are OPEN ON SATURDAY!
5 Dr. Gallimore will put you at ease.  His team is always friendly.  The practice is kid friendly.
