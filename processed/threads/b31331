1 Poor quality prints, subpar paper stock and VERY expensive compared to a local shop.  I understand price would be higher since it's in Cosmo but $100 for 10 copies of a double-sided 11x17 when I paid $50 for THIRTY (30) copies at a local shop of MUCH better quality???  Pretty bad if you ask me...
4 The only reason I only gave four stars is because I had to place my order over the phone for delivery to my client at her hotel. I am a printer in Winston-Salem, NC and awoke this morning to a frantic text message and two telephone messages at my office from my client. She is in town with a very well known manufacturer of undergarments who is sponsoring a charity golf tournament hosted by Michael Jordan. One of the pieces we printed for her had a mistake and she was desperate to get them replaced. I called and worked with Sheree who quickly processed my request and had them delivered two hours earlier than my request - much to the delight of my client. Thanks for the save Sheree!!
