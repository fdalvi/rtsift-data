5 I really like using Yelp but could not find this location on here and I knew it was just around the corner from my house so I went over there and grabbed a business card so I can add it to the list of good ice cream in the Arcadia area. I was very impressed with the smiles and the welcome I got when I walked in here tonight with my friend. When we got there we found so many good choices and the young lady behind the counter seemed to enjoy what she does and the makes me want to go back for more.
5 Last Saturday night we went in for a cool creamy treat! The store had run out of punch cards but the young man working behind the counter generously gave me his personal punch card with 7 punches in it! So kind & cool!!!!
3 Well, it's Cold Stone so what can I say that hasn't already been said.  Service staff is hit or miss and you have to enjoy overpaying for a sinful treat but it is very tasty and you can get it almost any way you want.
2 I'm so depressed I can't even write this. The past three visits, no coffee ice cream. Bummer. 2 stars because I like the concept and love the ice cream.
1 Don't order a cake online and expect it be ready when you come in to pick it up. You can place an order for a custom cake online, pay for it in advance, and they will confirm your order. Unfortunately, that's where it ends. You can show up at pick up time and no one knows anything about your order and no cake will be waiting for you. I had to settle for something out of the freezer case that wasn't what I had ordered. Very disappointing. In the future I'll spend my money somewhere that's actually interesting in providing good customer service. It's a shame they just don't care.
