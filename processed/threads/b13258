5 Gourmet Coffee, Fresh Bakery, Soup, Sandwiches, and best of all Home made Gelato in dozens of wild flavors. Clean and comforatble, with outside seating too. Best coffehouse in town.
4 Oh Java Cat. How I miss you!   The Cat is a wee cafe where you can get some AMAZING gelato(peanut butter habanero,  if you please), a cup of piping hot fill-in-the-blank-with-your-fave-drink, and a damn good chicken stew, if I may say so!  ...makes me miss the East Side!
4 Meow Meow!  I have only had the coffee and gelato and yeh I loved them both so much I have been back many times.  The service is awesome and the baristas here are always on top of their game, and super friendly as well.    They have an drive thru which I think is awesome, especially for the east side... The Cat is pretty much the only one for good drive thru coffee in this area..  There is a large patio for spring/summer!   They also have sandwiches and soups which I am excited to get down there soon and try those out as well.   I would strongly suggest you grab a drink at the Java Cat.. you won't be disappointed!
4 Nice place...
4 Fresh baked pastries, homemade gelato and excellent coffee, just some of the items which Java Cat excels at!! The Cat has lots of live music too, not just the random hippie stuff or starving artist but decent music from different cultures! The building is tight and can get crowded but the outside patio can handle any spill-over no problem. The fact that they're open early (5:30 am) means you can get the freshest coffee and bakery anywhere before heading off to work!! Bravo Java Cat, bravo!!!
2 I'm downgrading my review substantially today after making another visit to Java Cat.  The space is funky, at least for this neighborhood, and the coffee house tries to be gourmet, but there are numerous failings.  First, and it may seem trivial, but when you walk into a dark cave of a space in the summer, you don't want to see garish "cool white" CFL light bulbs in the track lighting.  Track lighting is meant to give warm, pinpoint accent lighting and the CFL's are harsh and blue.  Second, I ordered a BLT imagining it would be hard to screw up this sandwich.  I sat and waited way too long as the ladies behind the counter chatted away.  After more than 10 minutes someone yelled out "did someone order a BLT?" gesturing at the counter, where my sandwich had obviously been sitting for a while.  At no point in the ordering process did they tell me how my sandwich would be delivered or announced.  Apparently I was supposed to watch the counter.  On to the sandwich.  The BLT came on flavorless, doughy-white ciabatta type of bread and had lettuce hanging out a good two inches on all sides.  The ingredients were jammed in in an unceremonious fashion, but nevermind, I thought.  If it tastes good, I am happy.  After folding the lettuce over so that I could actually take a bite, I realized that the bacon was extremely salty and tough.  I lifted off the bread and saw that they had used bacon shaped into rounds, obviously  manufactured for use on bacon cheeseburgers and other fast-food nastiness.  The bacon was so salty and nasty that I couldn't taste the rest of the sandwich and literally had to choke the thing down.    I'm afraid that Java Cat really falls short in a city that aspires to much more.  Just down the road Crema Caf√© does everything much better, with a flourish and a flair and with a real sense of customer service.  The new Madison Sourdough cafe on Willy Street is a great gem of a place, raising the bar on casual breakfast and lunch fare even higher.  The only thing that could possibly recommend Java Cat is their gelato, which is an unusual and refreshing offering on this side of the lake.
5 This little locally-owned coffee shop is a great addition to this east side neighborhood. I bought a house in the area just before Java Cat opened. In all honesty, I was concerned about how it would survive. I was totally wrong.  Several years later, Java Cat is thriving. It's always crowded and for good reason. The food is excellent. The coffee is very tasty. And don't get me started on the gelato...to die for!!   Don't forget they provide computers if you want to get some work done!  The best part about Java Cat: the drive through! What a fantastic idea. I'm happy to see this place is doing well. It's definitely worth your time and money. Very good!!
3 Great little coffee spot, and a welcome addition to the area. The coffee is good with lots of choices (Javalato, anyone?). There are also lots of food options - hot and cold sandwiches, soups, lots of pastries, and chocolates from local chocolatiers. Just once you have to try the squares of cake & butter cream frosting dipped in chocolate ganache.  Most coffee shops have wi-fi these days, but how many actually provide the computers? There are three, they're free, and far less busy than you would think. I've only had to wait twice in my dozens of visits.  Java Cat hosts music on the weekends, and usually really good acts. I'll never forget the 9-year-old accompanying his dad's Irish jigs on the bodhran - really well, too! And the rotating gallery art is always worth a look. (As opposed to the permanent collection, which is....excessively cat themed.)  Oh, and the drive through. Yay!  So why did I give it only three stars?  Let's start with the atmosphere. Dark purple walls, black ceiling and a lot of grey make for one gloomy room. If not for the warm wooden furniture and the large front window, the place would be downright depressing.  Then there's the temperature: freezing. One day this summer I noticed that I wasn't the only one huddled in a sweater and asked if they could turn the AC down, They said they have to keep the ambient temperature at 60 to keep the gelato from melting. Really? The freezer doesn't do that? Now, I don't know if that's the official line, but I do know that Java Cat is often uncomfortably cold.  And finally, it's no place for small children. There is one high chair and one booster seat, and neither has any straps/buckles to hold a kid in. There's no changing table in the bathroom, even though there's plenty of space for one. Changing diapers on the floor of a public bathroom sucks. And they actually removed the small kids' area they used to have. If I didn't know better, I'd think Java Cat was deliberately making it hard for people with babies to hang out there. Actually, I'm pretty sure that's exactly what they're doing.
4 Java Cat! Kinda cute little place that serves a good cup of coffee along with great soups, better sandwiches, and amazing gelato.   Had a Monte Cristo there with maple syrup and chips and was very pleased. Partner was hesitant after I described it and one bite and she nearly took the entire sandwich away! Whenever we go past, we check if it is open.  Very polite staff, helpful, patient.  Only thing I have had that was not fantastic was a spiced apple cider which had about three times as much cinnamon as it should have. Serious burning pain up my nose on the first whiff.
5 this place is fantastic! their gelato alone is reason to travel across town to check it out. i'm not one for coffee, so i can't speak about that, but the gelato is certainly killer, especially on a hot day by the lake.   the website above is wrong though, the actual website is here: http://www.javacatmadison.com/
5 Had a chance to get back to Java Cat today. Seriously. If you love frozen treats and you haven't been here yet, I am shedding a tear for you.   The best gelato I've had, hands down. Both in quality, and creativity of flavors.   (as a side note, the man and I split a BLT today as well, which was also yummy in that good-old-classic-sandwich kind of way).
3 I love the drive through on my way to work and go the about once a week.  The coffee is yummy.  I never go there for food because it isn't all that great.  They also are not at all kid friendly.  No toys or books and no changing area in the bathroom even though there's space.  If they got rid of the old computers that not many people use they'd have a nice little area for kids.  Happy Bambino is right around the corner so I think it would get used.
5 Best coffee in Madison, in my opinion.  The blueberry scones are extra good as well. If you're in the area it's totally worth a stop. Oh, the staff is very nice as well!
4 I like this place. There usually aren't any screaming kids bothering me. Also, they have old computers that people can use to do useful things, like search the internet and write yelp reviews expressing their valid and not-so-valid opinions.
4 I really enjoy The Java Cats house espresso roast, very smooth yet complex and full, very similar to Illy Cafe--epsresso roast, or Torrefazione Italia-- Perugia blend. I have tried well over one hundred blends and roasters over the years as an espresso business owner in Seattle, and find the Jave Cat coffee to be very well done and is worth a try if you really care what your coffee tastes like and how it is prepared. They have a great "coffee house" atmosphere with live music on weekends and serve fresh "in-house" baked goods, sandwiches, salads, and soup. Java Cats also offers superb home made gelatin and italian ices made daily, yumm.
4 The coffee seriously taste better from Java Cat than any other place on earth. Pure taste bud delight and always served by the friendliest staff. You can tell the owners put their heart into it! I mostly go through the drive through on my way  to work. Which is really saying something because its not really on my way to work and I work right next to a coffee shop. Java cats coffee tastes better, cost less for the quantity than most places around, including the place next to my job.   The only reason I am not giving it a 5 is its not my favorite decor style in side, kinda dark and dated looking. They really are not very accommodating to children either but I kinda love them for that, and I do have kids. If I wanted to listen to my kids loud banter while I sipped my coffee I would have drank it at home.  I do think they could use some help with the vegetarian section of the menu but personally the coffee flavor and Love I feel when I go in there make up for any short comings. Im actually sipping on a cup of joe from the shop next to my work because I was desperate and wishing it were from Java Cat instead. Which is what made me think of writing this review. Tomorrow I will leave for work earlier... Java Cat stole my heart..
4 Good strong coffee, tasty baked goods, free WiFi, friendly service and yummy gelato, combined with a diverse clientele and nice vibe--Java Cat is head and shoulders above any of the coffee chains. Really the only drawback is the very limited parking, which sometimes necessitates a bit of a walk, not a problem in good weather, but not fun during our much too long Wisconsin winter.
5 HOMEMADE GELATO. Oh, and friendly service and clientele.
5 Gelato . . . Enough said.
5 Best coffee and gelato in town. My kids and my husband love the friendly atmosphere and clientele...
5 These guy have got it going!  The drive thru is a nice feature - I use it often.  The atmosphere is comfy, the gelato is out of this world and sometimes they schedule live music.  Plus the owners are really good people.  You con't go wrong here.
5 I like to come here to focus on a project.  Great coffee house vibe.  The staff clearly likes being here.  Everything is unique and delicious.  I had the soup of the day.  Baja chicken.  Excellent!!!
2 I do t get this place, coffee is weak, sandwiches are terrible and service is confused and slow. If I want gelato it's great, but seriously better food at Crema down the road.
2 WARNING! JUDGMENTAL BARISTA RANT!!   Wow, these baristas need some training. I ordered a 16oz Iced Latte. Nothing too difficult. The girl who served me pulled 35 second shots (23-28 seconds is the standard for espresso shots) then poured them over the ice in my cup deluding the shots, then added milk and more ice. It tasted awful...   If you come here just order a regular cup of coffee or tea and then get some gelato. Don't waste your money on their "more complicated" drinks.   Rant over.   They do use just coffee which is a plus!
5 Great food, especially the gelato and the breakfasts - but the sandwiches and bakery items are good also.  Can be hard to get a table on weekend mornings,  more so in the winter.
