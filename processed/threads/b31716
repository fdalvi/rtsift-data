5 I woke up to a soaked carpet. Kevin quickly found the leak was under the slab. When I then found that my HOA covered slab leaks with their own plumber, Kevin gracefully backed out.  I called him back later for a separate problem - a kitchen drain leak; it was quickly fixed by him.  He is knowledgeable, polite, and prompt. Highly recommended.
5 Kevin is so honest and helpful.  I always get a real upfront cost.  I've had plumbers come where it feels like a game on their bidding and he doesn't do that.  His prices are fair and justified.  I feel comfortable with him in my home and he doesn't give me creeps like some of the other guys I have had work on my house in the past.  I would HIGHLY recommend him and will use him whenever I need him.
5 Kevin is very honest and does an excellent job at a very reasonable cost. I highly recommend KW Plumbing! Will definitely call KW Plumbing for any future plumbing issues.
