5 Body Beloved was the best facial I ever had. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming. My skin feels like it got the best detox ever!!!. I left there feeling more relaxed than I have in a long time. My face was glowing. I went directly out since my skin looked so amazing. Cara is kind and professional and will treat you like a queen or king!! It is a must for anyone looking to spoil themselves for a day.
5 Cara is great. Being a guy, I'm not really into facials and pampering, but I do tend to break out far too frequently. Cara showed me that chemical peels can help clear up breakouts and even out the skin tone. I'm amazed by the changes and how effective even one treatment can be. She spent the time to find the peel that was most effective for me and didn't try to push a bunch of products on me- she was focused on the best outcome for me.  Thanks cara!!
5 I have been going to Cara for years and have never had a bad experience! I love all her product and she alway make me feel totally relaxed! (5)***** stars All the way!!! Highly recommend this place!!!
