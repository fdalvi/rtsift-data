3 I've visited the 75th & Tbird location of this chain, and both are about the same; your average mani/pedi. Sometimes there is a wait but not too long. Their prices are decent; $17 for a no-frills pedi, $24 for mani/pedi. I was excited to get a chair with working massage - it seems like I usually get stuck in the one that's broken.   The techs are all very nice. There are the usual ton of options/upgrades. This place is distinct in that the tech handed me a price list of options, instead of just asking if I wanted sugar, design, etc, and making me ask for prices. I've been royally screwed in the past, as I'm sure many others have.   I must say, my tech did a fabulousjob on my toes. This pedi is a week old now, and not so much as a single chip. Now if I could just get a mani which was as durable!
3 I've been going there for years to get my nails done.  Price is right, and I've always received very good service.
1 I stopped there the Friday before Easter to get a pedicure.  Imagine my surprise when they would not allow my service dog (diabetes alert dog) in their establishment.  Three women came charging at us as we came in the door, screaming and pointing at my service dog "GET DOG OUT!"  The dog was wearing a service coat. I tried to explain, but they kept pointing and screaming at me.  Other customers tried to help me, but they would not relent.  I finally left, went a block away and my dog was received warmly.  I had left word for the owner to call me.  He called me at 10:00 PM (I was in bed) to tell me that his employees were scared of dogs and that he would not allow ANY dogs in his shops (this is a chain).  He didn't care if she was a service dog.  I've NEVER been treated this way by ANY establishment that I take my dog in. Bottom line: if you have a service dog, you will not be allowed access with your dog in Bien Nails.  I will NEVER go there again, and will do all I can to let people know what happened.
