5 I've been coming here for years, bringing them 3 of my cars so far. They are awesome people out there. I truly feel that they use good judgement, know what they're doing, honest people trying to run a  solid business. Their prices are very competitive, therefore they are using a healthy cost to ensure that it's quality service while not bankrupting either the customer or the business. So far I only know the two main counter guys but both are excellent employees. If it weren't for them I probably wouldn't be taking my vehicle there. Definitely recommended!
5 My "check coolant level" indicator came on so I thought I'd have these guys check it for me.  I walked in and asked how busy they were.  The manager said "very" and I told him my concern and he promptly said "oh, just pull it into the first bay and I will have one of the guys check it" 5 minutes later I drove away with my coolant topped off without charge.   GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!!
5 We have used Fletcher's for all of our auto service needs since we moved to Buckeye 7 years ago. They have always done excellent work and are very fair on their pricing. They have been very honest and helped us save money several times compared to other local places. Case in point, a few months ago we bought a used car and took it a few places to get estimates and determine what repairs were needed.........another local brake place (won't mention the name) gave us an estimate for almost $1900 for the repairs needed. We went over to Fletcher's and got the same work done for less than $1000. By the way, the $1900 estimate we received from their competitor was after we negotiated it down to that price, it was almost $2200 prior to that. Come to find out, 2 of the things on the list from their competitor were not even needed and were just added to pad the list of needed repairs.   It is nice to know that we have a place we can trust and that will do great work at a great price.
