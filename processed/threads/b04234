4 The service at this Barros is great. We have always gotten our food real fast and it is always fresh. The Barros special pizza is the best. The wings are always great. They have TVs going to keep you entertained. I also like how they have a separate kids area so there are not tons of rugrats running around. They also have awesome lunch specials where you can get pizza by the slice and a drink for super cheap.
5 The family and I love this place. The pizza is fantastic, they load on the toppings. Definitely try the Chicken Supreme. You won't be disappointed.    My kids really enjoy playing and eating in the kids area and devour the pizza.   The price is very reasonable and even more so when considering all the food you get. I highly recommend Barro's Pizza.
5 Love the pizza.
4 Had the mega meat pizza... It was pretty good. Usually take my kids here as it has a play area.
