1 Horrible company! Did not complete installation, installer did not even use plastic, and a 2-4 day job is now going over a week! They also delete bad reviews of themselves from Facebook! Dan (owner) is a liar himself in that he promised to call us back and satisfy his customers. He is a dishonest man and runs a dishonest company!!!  NEVER use this company!!!
5 My husband and I had slate installed in our bathroom last month and we love it!! The installers arrived on time covered everything in plastic and went to work. Within a few hrs the install was done and the bathroom looks amazing. Needless to say we will be contacting them again next year to install slate through the rest of the house!!! Thanks Dan, you have outstanding customer service!!!
