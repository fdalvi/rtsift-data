5 Great massage, I walked out feeling very relaxed and the pain in my neck was gone.
5 I finished off my day treating myself with a massage. I was a little skeptical trying Daniel Fernandez LMT since it did not have many reviews. I went on a groupon deal and WOW. Daniel has a very relaxing and sedating technique. He found spots on me I didn't know were sore. Tension in my shoulders and back is gone and I feel great. I will be back...
5 A last minute canceled lunch date, plus I'm still hobbling around  led me to a Groupon Now deal  for a 60 minute deep tissue massage with hot stones for $41.  Too good to be true, but I called and left a message and Daniel called me back with an availability that day.  His practice is part of a collective group of independent massage and skin care therapists in the Longford Medical Center.  It takes a bit to navigate to the collective space, but his room is pleasant and serene with just the right amount of essential oils and level and mood of music.    We discussed my problem areas and he focused on them all. A totally terrific experience of deep tissue, trigger point & hot stone.  This guy is exceptional!  His prices are terrific even without a groupon:http://www.danielfernandez.massagetherapy.com/
5 This guy is great makes you feel comfortable  from the beginning! Takes his time and you don't feel rush. I'm definitely going back
5 I have been going to Daniel for a year now and my neck and back problems are gone. He has helped me with my posture problems from working at a desk most of the time. With his tips and help I have maintained myself pain free. I highly recommend Daniel. He is very professional and knowledgeable. I'm looking forward to my next session.
