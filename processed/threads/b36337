5 I am from Chicago and I have to say WCD has the best Italian beef sandwich I have ever had in Arizona! The Chicago dog was excellent as.well. Nice setting a little hard to find as it sits in the middle of a park (Gateway in El Mirage) and there is little signage on the road but great all the same.
3 I had the Italian beef sandwich   It's hard to compare because they are just flat out hard to find outside Chicago.  I will say it was a bit short of being anything I would call authentic you could be disappointed if you've been to Chicago. They do however sell real authentic ingredients to make your own Chicago dogs.  Pretty much nothing more than a hot dog stand at a skate park.
3 Great place to have lunch with the kids... Food is okay, but I've had better... The hot dogs are a worthy treat, but the tamales are disappointing...
5 Hard to find. It's tucked behind solar panels on Cinnabar, it's not on El Mirage. It was pretty good overall!
5 Absolutely great with kids good food great prices and one amazing Italian beef sandwich!!! It's a must try when your at el mirage park!!!!
