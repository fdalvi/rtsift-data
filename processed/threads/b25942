3 It's fast, their friendly, it's cheap and it can be healthy if you order the right thing. I tried the new Garlic Garlic Chicken, did I mention the Garlic?  It was good and a better choice than anything fried.  White chicken, veggies and a dark garlic sauce on steamed white rice, somewhat healthy.
1 Went there today with my kids the manager was so rude and could careless what the food looks or tastes like. The teriyaki chicken is always burnt after they chop it up they leave the scraps on the counter.  I went to use the restroom only to discover that the toilet would not flush thank goodness I only had to pee! When I mentioned it to the manager she just shrugged it off. This place is an embarrassment to our neighborhood! !
5 All I can say is yum!!!! I came here today for dinner with my hubs and I am already craving more. I asked him if we could come back tomorrow night. He said yes because Panda Express is not only affordable, it is delicious. I like to get the chow mein even though it is not the healthiest dish on their menu. That's why I also got the shiitake kale chicken breast. Delicious! Highly recommend.
2 Not impressed. Been there over 8 times the last 2 months. Cold, Burnt, Rock hard orange chicken. Rice all clumped together and tasted frozen. So not a fan of this Panda. There are other ones farther away that I would rather drive too and get better food. I love Panda - just not this location.
