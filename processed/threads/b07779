5 My dad and i have been going to these guys since '05. They are honest guys and wont try to make you fix everything on your car. They will tell you how long you can go with out getting things fixed. They are generally really fast about things. Hao always remembers us when we bring our cars in, and is happy to see us (but who wouldn't be happy about loyal business)  Great local mechanics that know what they are doing. They give you a fair price and don't overcharge for things. Great guys to deal with!  There is a reason why we don't go to any other mechanic in town.
5 This European  auto body shop is staffed with certified techs who are well skilled and trained on foreign cars. I discovered this location several years ago while driving down the street. My Mercedes at the time needed a ton of work. The techs inspected my vehicle and let me know the pricing to fix all my repairs. They were very friendly and took their time to make sure I understood the areas that needed to be repaired. I have to say for someone who knows nothing about cars they were very helpful and did not take advantage of me. I been returning ever since.   Some of the services they offer are AC Services, Alignments, Brakes Road Trip check and much, much more.  They have a cozy waiting room for your to wait while your car is getting fixed.
5 This place is my go-to repair shop. They've done an excellent job with my Honda Civic and Accord. Very fair on price and the workmanship is spot-on. Fixed a few weird problems with my Accord and did a wonderful tune up on my Civic. Hao and his brother runs the shop and offers very good care for their customer's car. I've seen an array of makes and models in their garage so Japan, European and Domestic are all within their wheel house.
5 Awesome! Honest and fair. Will do business again. I came from Gene's Auto Worx in Tempe.  Gene's is shady..
