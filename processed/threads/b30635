1 If possible, I would give A Perfect Sole zero stars...and I never even had a chance to visit the place! I purchased 3 certificates for a "relaxing express pedicure" from WeeklyPlus.com, one for myself and two as gifts. Since the purchase date, I have repeated attempted to call and schedule appointments, alternately leaving messages for Toni (the owner) or hearing that she was so busy but would call me back in "10 minutes". I've never received a call back and, when she did pick up the phone during my calls, she was pretty rude. One friend who received my gifted certificate was finally able to make an appointment after repeated calls, but has said that the woman she spoke to was rude and even a little scary. I'm ashamed that my gift has turned out so poorly and have even asked my friend to cancel her appointment and I'll give her a pedicure at a different salon.  WeeklyPlus.com said they've received lots of negative feedback about A Perfect Sole and were willing to refund my account for the unused certificates. Also check out the guest book on the company's website for more comments about customers' poor service experiences.
1 Just plain unprofessional!
5 One of the best pedicures I have ever had.  Toni is a delight and the results last for weeks.  Very fun atmosphere with an interesting clientele!!
