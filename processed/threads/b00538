5 I volunteered at this place last week with a a local missionary group called the Mathew 25 Project. It was my first time working with Mathew 25 and also at Umom.  This is a transitional shelter for families.  We fed around 100-150 people in what was basically a clean comfortable cafeteria style environment.  This is a converted hotel/motel in Phoenix and I was really impressed with the facility and the staff was so kind and capable.  If you are looking for an opportunity to serve or if you are a parent in a tough place, I would highly recommend giving them a call.  Great experience!!
5 UMOM helps homeless families in need.  Their shelter provides a safe place for them to  stay and work on finding permanent housing.  They also help domestic violence victims find shelter as well.  Until I moved to Scottsdale and heard a presentation from them, I had never heard of this charity.  It really touched me to hear the stories and they invited me to come visit the facility.  After seeing what they do first hand, I knew I had to get involved somehow....so we donated some blankets and furniture as well as gave some monetary support.  I am all about helping charities that put your donations to good use and this is one of those who are making an immediate impact on the community.  Kudos to the volunteers who work at their facility and help these families in need!  Return Factor - 100%
5 It's is rare that I give five stars, but how can I not. They help homeless families and low income families. As well, they have after school programs.  Got to love those, that help others.
