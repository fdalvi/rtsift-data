5 Ive been coming here periodically over 5 years. There has been months that i did not need to go but i  go see Dr. Jensen once a month because of my needs . If there is new pain from bad exercising, i just walk in the next day and tell him where it hurts and he will handle it. A typical visit entails little to no wait, then lie on a rolling bed for about 15 minutes before Dr. Jensen work on your back. Dr. Jensen is very experienced, down to earth, easy to speak to and works at relax pace. You will be out of there in no more than 30 minutes. They open till 6pm, Mon Wed and Fri currently , so Ive always able to make it after work.  Im having Dr. Jensen treating me from an auto incident, so far the program im going through has been helpful while the pain is being relieved. His office is helpful with dealing with insurance company. When you start out with him, he will do an evaluation for you and maybe take a scan. Your needs may be different than mine but so far, im in good hands.
5 After trying a great many different Chiropractor's over the years, we have finally found one that works... and works very well. My wife has suffered for years with a nagging back pain. You know the kind... the kind that just seems to be persistent.  Dr. Jensen didn't fix it in one visit like so many Chiropractor's promise, however over the the course a a few weeks the pain has come quite manageable and my wife is finally able to lead a normal life. It seems the only real pain now is me being a pain in the butt to her. Thanks Dr. Jensen.
5 I am 68 with chronic neck and back pain and had never been to a chiropractor. 2 months ago I walked into Dr. Jensen's office at Arrowhead Lakes and inquired about the treatments. The staff was so nice that I made an appointment.  When I first met Dr. Jensen  I told him my history and that he was my last hope.  We laughed and got started.  A month later I am a new person with very little pain.  Why did I not go in 30 years ago?!!
