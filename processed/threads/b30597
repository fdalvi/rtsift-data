5 I am a Farmers Agent here is Washington State. Our agency periodically has had clients either move to ARIZONA or buy a SECOND home in Arizona. We always refer them to Marc Sollee/Farmers Insurance Agent! We get great feedback from them on his professionalism and how easy he makes the insurance process. Whether you are moving to Arizona, Live in Arizona or are buying SECOND home this is the Insurance Agent for you!
5 I incorrectly assumed that a traffic citation on my record would mean being insured by one of the larger, more reputable companies would be expensive, if not impossible. Marc was so friendly, professional and efficient! He set up an auto and a renter's policy for me in one call and I was delighted to find my rates were no more than the iffy company I was already insured with. Peace of mind is worth it when it comes to insurance and Marc was a key element in that!
5 I have some experience with accidents and insurance claims.  It's important to have a good agent who make sure you're covered properly.   Marc Sollee is what I can an extra miler.   He takes the extra time to do it right and he's backed by a company, Farmers Insurance,  that in my experience takes good care of their customers.
