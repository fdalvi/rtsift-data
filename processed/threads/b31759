5 great place!  Nice inside.   They even have a good selection of wine.
3 This is actually the smallest bar I've ever seen, and they do a nice job of utilizing the space...well, at least for seating. For sports watching, it's tough to get a good angle. I need to go back during prime time...like on a Saturday night. Some patrons boasted about how fun this tiny tavern gets when it's packed. Will investigate.
4 Great Bartenders!  PATRONS ARE FRIENDLY and FUN!  Prices are awesome.  Music and  still able. to converse with your friends.  We Love this bar.
4 Just visited Willy's bar for the first time and it was a very welcoming bar.   The bartender was friendly and made an excellent bloody mary complete with pickled asparagus.  After two years it is still well kept and the regulars  bring a smile to your face.
4 Willy is one of the most modern decorated DIVE bar I have seen. Granite and chrome, nice lighting and decor.   The service was great other then the debit machine was down for awhile...it's OK I just had another drink.   The afternoon I was in they had fried chicken from Albertson's for the patrons...how cool!   Prices and pours were right on!
5 Super welcoming. Little hole in the wall and you can tell everyone in there is a regular but you don't feel like you have to suck down your beer and get out of there. Good deals on beers. We have only had one bar tender there I don't know her name but she is so sweet!
