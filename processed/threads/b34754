2 "Would you like some stamps or ice with that?"  With my Snickers bar? No thanks, they don't go well together. How about this, Circle K..."If I wanted stamps or ice I WOULD HAVE ASKED FOR THEM!"  Ugh, I can't stand this Circle K. Always trying to up sell me on shit I don't need. It ain't that clean either. It's jam packed with the many farm and construction workers in the area so it is convenient for them. The location earns them a second star since there isn't much in the area. Also, Circle K fixed their overcharging for 5 Hour Energy drinks by offering a 2 for $5(reg) and 2 for $6 (extra strength) special. I don't know, probably still too much for them, but they help me get through the day.
3 I, personally, don't have any problem with a cashier asking if I want stamps or ice because I chronically forget these particular items ALL THE TIME.  The only complaint I have with this store is that they NEVER have iced tea in the iced tea dispenser AND they don't have any unsweetened or low-calorie canned iced tea in the coolers. I don't drink soda but I love my caffiene, therefore, I drink lots of iced tea during the summer. Please, please Circle K management...fix the iced tea dispenser or something! I have the option of going to Shell, but I like your delicious cheese, cracker and grapes snack packs. Caffiene will win over food eventually though....
1 I thought I drove into another country....a third world country.....a sketchy third world country when I pulled off the 10 real quick.  I won't let my wife go here alone, day or night.
