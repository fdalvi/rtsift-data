5 I am a chiropractor, this is where I go to get adjusted.  Dr. Thoma is the most knowledgeable chiropractor I have ever known.  When I started under Dr. Thoma's care I had very bad mid-back pain due to strenuous exercise and a stressful lifestyle.  Dr. Thoma took and analyzed my x-rays in the most detailed manner possible.  He discovered that my spinal alignment was in need of some major improvement.  Through his adjustments and the corrective exercises he prescribed me I am now pain free and feel better than I did when I was a teenager!  Thank you Dr. Thoma, I'm so glad I found you!!
5 Dr. John Thoma is a healer.  As a chiropractor myself, I am under Dr. Thoma's care because I know he is one of the best.  His knowledge is beyond belief and his care is specifically tailored to meet my needs with regards to addressing spinal misalignment as well as muscle imbalance.  Because Dr. Thoma was an elite athletic trainer for years before becoming a chiropractor, he understands a huge spectrum of biomechanical issues that are helpful in the care of his patients.
5 This is by far the most dedicated Dr.I have ever worked with. Not only do I no longer move in pain.  I have improved in every category of fitness.  I can run faster, jump higher and perform at a level I was never able to reach in the past.  I advise anyone who has limitations in movement or pain in movement to get on the right path and make an appointment with Infinity Spine Center.  It will change your life.  I know because it changed mine.
5 Amazing doctors that truly have your best interest in mind. Full of knowledge to help you live the best and healthiest life.
