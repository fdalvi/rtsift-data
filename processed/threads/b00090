4 I like Family Video. It has a large selection, good parking and the staff is knowledgeable and very friendly.   But unless you get a new/er movie or are just very lucky, it can be difficult to find widescreen movies. For some reason, FV tends to default to full frame when they sell down the stock to just one or two discs of a title. I'll admit that I am a complete widescreen snob, and this makes me crazy.   Otherwise they'd be getting five stars from me, no question.
1 Be very wary of the Family Video in Sun Prairie, WI, they do a great job trying to up sell you at the counter and next thing you know you are walking out the door with 3-5 movies when you came in intending to get two.  The problem with this, is they do not indicate anywhere on the movie when they are due back. You do not get a receipt indicating when they are due back, so if you have five movies and one is due back the next day and the other four in five days, you better be darn sure you know what one, or you will be surprised with a $8-$10 late charge. (And hopefully, the person that hands you the movies tells you the correct one)  When you ask them why they do not print off receipts, they state it is the cost of paper - well, I would think the cost of an angry customer(s) would be more concerning.
4 I was in Family Video last week. An employee told me that they are now going with all widescreen. They still have some older stuff that is fullscreen, but all the new stuff will be widescreen (damn straight!).
4 When I was about 12 years old, I got to sell popcorn with my Cub Scout Troop. Thankfully, the same type of people who still go to video stores are the same sort of people who contribute to youth organizations (lonely old people). I appreciate how much Family Video worked with us, and they have a good selection of films. When in town, choose Family Video over Blockbuster.
