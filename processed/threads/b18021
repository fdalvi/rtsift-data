4 Yes, I went to a McDonald's while in Vegas.  I even went twice *gasp*   The first time was because my friend and I felt that we had lost enough at the blackjack table, so we went to McD's to drown our sorrows in some milkshakes and McFlurries while practicing with a deck of card and some nickels.  The second time was because we hadn't eaten lunch, but we knew we wouldn't be able to make it until dinner :)  So we stopped really quickly for some fries...and more McFlurries ;)  The service isn't the quickest, but they are friendly and the food is good!  Stop in for a quick treat!
1 These people here are retards. Caught them overcharging my friend for his senior coffee. Then they got my order of two coffees wrong three times in a row. Dude was a punk too shaking his head and acting like a jerk. I think life's gonna be a long road for him.
5 Yay...polite and very fast for a busy mcdonalds.
