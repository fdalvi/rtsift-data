2 Very average in every way. Staff eating while making customer food. Way over staffed considering the very mediocre level of customer service. "Manager" went out to smoke, came back inside and started preparing food without washing his hands. Even though the drive thru business is very light, they seem to ask almost every car to pull up, park & wait??
5 Went here yesterday and they forgot my 99 cent chicken nugget. I called and the manager said sorry and then put me down for a free 12 piece chicken nugget and frosty. He made the whole trip 100% better for me. Also every time I drive thru they always get my special requests right. This is also the first time they have ever forgotten food. When I go thru they always pet my dog and are social. I enjoy coming here.
2 On Friday, June 26, 2013 we were headed to the movies at the Superstition Springs in Mesa.  We decided to eat dinner before the movie and stopped at Wendy's on Hampton instead of the food court in the mall.    We got one kids nugget meal, a baconator combo, an Apple Pecan Chicken salad and a large tea.  When we arrived at the mall, there was no chocolate milk for my daughter's meal and two knives and no fork for my salad.  We couldn't go drive all the way back to the Wendy's to get everything that they forgot.    After the movie we went back to Wendy's with our receipt.  We gave them our receipt and told them that we had been there previously and we did not get our chocolate milk.  They weren't busy, so about 4 employees came to the window.  The MOD said, "we don't have chocolate milk".   So we said, "how about regular milk?"  We got a milk and they asked if there was anything else we could do.  I asked for my receipt  back.  They looked worried because there is a telephone number on the receipt and it says "how was your visit".    Well in the immortal word of Leo Geotz , always check your bag because you get f*@#ed in the drive through........
