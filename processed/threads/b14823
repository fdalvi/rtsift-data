3 Steve the owner came out and sprayed for bees.  The way he sprays he doesn't get all the bees at once so he did have to come back for a 2nd treatment (free of charge) and then did kill all the bees but for that 1 day in between they were pretty pissed off and stung my neighbor.  We were too scared to go through the front door since that was where they were.  I would have preferred for them to have them all taken care of on the first visit but he did explain why that wasn't a good idea.  At the end of the day they were taken care of and haven't been a problem since.
5 Steve did an amazing job.  I called my regular pest control company and they said someone would be out in 4-6 hours to quote me a price and then they would send someone else out to fix the problem.  Steve on the other hand answered his phone immediately, showed up about 2 hours later and gave me a status when he was running 10 minutes late. It turned out we only had scout bee's, no colony, so he charged me less than 1/2 the usual price and gave us a 30 day warranty.  Great experience overall.
