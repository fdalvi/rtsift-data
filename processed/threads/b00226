4 Having been fucked over by U-Haul one too many times, I passed over their convenient downtown locations and headed out to the airport for a recent move.    This is how truck rental should be done.  Quick, efficient, clean, reasonably priced. And they had the advantage on U-Haul in that they actually had trucks available.    One caveat: moving season in Madison is August and this rental was in November.  That might account for the ease of the transaction.
2 I arrived in Madison about 6:45pm on what was possibly one of the coldest Monday night in Madison this year only to discover that when getting my rental car that they were not allowing customers to pickup their car, instead they had runners getting the cars and letting them warm up before letting customers go out in the -22 below weather. Now I can appreciate that however it shouldn't take nearly 45 minutes to get your car, I watched the rest of the airport clear out while I was left waiting for my rental car. I was very disappointed and was actually the last person waiting in the airport.   Because of this I think that I will take a direct flight from Saint Louis into Milwaulkee and make the hour drive into Madison. Flying into smaller airports is often frustrating simply because their rental car staff is rather limited, this was a perfect example of a rental gone wrong.
