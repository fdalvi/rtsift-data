1 Michael my broker in Prescott, AZ is fantastic but the organization as a whole is the pits.  The first house I made an offer on, they sent out an appraiser that was illiterate using an appraisal which looked like it came from another property then he appraised it $20K below what its actual value was.  So there went my appraisal fee.  The the next house, I was approved for the loan and was ready to close and had movers scheduled to move my furniture and then because I accepted an advanced position making more money with another organization, they tried to delay the closing for another 2 weeks to a month.  Resulted in me  losing the house and expedited appraisal plus the additional expense.  Needless to say I fired them and went with another lender.  Very unreliable.  Had me doing a lot of the foot work to obtain financial documents that they were being paid to gather themselves.  If you have any other options for a lender go with that one and save yourself a lot of expense and aggravation.  I feel sorry for anyone that has the misfortune of dealing with this lender.
