4 So this is a Vegas country dive bar that has karaoke.  It is 4 miles down Boulder Highway from downtown -  bar names don't get much more on point than that eh?  (East Vegas Wasteland Bar was considered too honest)  Anyway this place is the most authentic Texas Roadhouse style saloon that I've seen in Vegas, not that I've really been looking.  The karaoke is DJ'd by a man with a HANDLEBAR MUSTACHE who looks like a real cowboy.  There is a shotgun behind the counter next to the register.  I noted three cowboy hats.  They have an extensive selection of cheap beers and liquors, and enough whiskey to get a donkey drunk.  I went with the $3 (!?) draft pint of Amberbock, a domestic with a darker color and more flavor than most.  The karaoke was not as awful as I had feared, although there was a lot of Garth Brooks in the hizzy, peeps.
4 Another great Vegas dive bar with the cheapest well drinks we've found ($2.25 for Christian Bros. brandy and soda).  If you like country, karaoke on Friday is good.  Friendly people behind and in front of the bar.  We always stop here when we're in town!
3 We thought we would start our day off with a short trip from downtown Las Vegas . . . and 4 miles away sits this small dive bar . . . with cheap cold beer . . . that is if they would have CO2.  Are you kidding me . . . a bar running out of CO2 . . . you are either a really busy and great dive bar . . . or . . . you have problems.  Sorry to say . . . I believe it's the latter.  Anyways . . . we stopped in mid morning and there were plenty of locals playing the slots . . . so it is truly hard to judge what this place would be like a night with Karaoke and a DJ . . . but I just can't get pass the fact that they ran out of CO2.  Will I ever be back . . . probably not . . . but if I do . . . I would be at night to see if this place is any better at another time of day.
