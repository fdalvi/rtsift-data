5 I have had hit and miss luck with dry cleaners in the past and have finally found one that does a great job at cleaning and is affordable.  They charge $1.99 per item - period.  If you get it in before 9 am you can pick it up after 4 pm.  It appears that they do all the cleaning on site.  So far, they have cleaned every spot I've had (I have a 4 month old - enough said).  My only complaint is that if you pay by debit card you are charged a $.75 fee.  Not a big deal, but I didn't see it posted anywhere.  The only other way to pay is with cash.  By the way, it is prepay.
3 Soo slow line out the door everytime I've been in....the dry cleaning for the price could have been much better =( Disappointed
1 Um, let's just say you do get your clothes returned in plastic wrap...that's about it.
5 Simply fantastic dry cleaning service. I dropped in because it was close by, and was amazed at the good attitudes of the employees. It's so hard to find good customer service anymore and I feel it's the best indicator of how good a business is.   They slammed through a large flux of people in no time at all,  They had my clothes done the same day, And their prices are great!
5 Great service - quick and friendly.  Great prices as well!
1 This place started out strong but ended up being sloppy.  I bring in about 8 shirts a week and every time I pick them up I end up disappointed.  One time, there was a stain that wasn't there when I dropped it off.  I think it was from their iron.  I will be looking for a new dry cleaning place even if it means paying more.
5 Okay so they pulled through in the clutch. My parents and reviews said that they were great and better yet they were rather cheap. They advertise on their window that if you check-in at 9am you will have clothes ready by 4pm the next day. I had an important job interview at 1pm, they had it ready for me at 10am the following day! They are amazing and they provide a great service!
