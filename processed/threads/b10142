5 My parents are the greatest. They are strong practicing Catholics. So when they were for Thanksgiving, they wanted to find a Catholic Church. My sister goggled to find one since I have not been practicing. My sister found this wonderful church. It's kinda in the middle of the one of the busiest streets downtown. But that goes to show you the age of the church. First was the church, then came the businesses. It took us a while to find parking since we can't park on the streets. We ended up parking in the back of the church where there was a small parking lot shared with many businesses. We asked some of the parishoners were we could park and they said anywhere in that back parking. As we approached the church, we noticed that had a open area with a beautiful statue of the Blessed Mary. Then we walked into the church. It was small, but beautiful. The stained glass windows are magnificently made, each one portraying someone that was Biblically Influential. The artwork they had behind the altar - fantastic. THIS is a beautifully structured placed to go and worship.
