4 This location is pretty friendly over all.  I walk over here when I get hungry during long days in the studio as its right around the corner. Yay for tacos and cheesy fries.
2 The food is good at this place, but for drive-through orders, I have been shorted on my order about 30-40% of the time.  If you go there, double-check your order regardless of how long it takes.  It'll be correct on the screen, but wrong in the bag, and usually missing something.  On a positive note, when I indicated I had a problem on their online survey, i got immediate and meaningful response from management.  However, the problem just occurred again today.  Management has more work to do.
4 It's jack in the box so you know what to expect but this is one of the few jack in the box locations that is not stingy at all with the condiments. I ordered a snack box and asked for ranch (you can put ranch on almost anything at jack) I got 5 containers of it. Don't mind me just getting excited over ranch.
