2 I went into Jiffy Lube for an oil change because it's the closest auto service center to my home and I didn't have the time to drive to a preferred shop.   I received what I expected from a Jiffy Lube: overpriced service (somewhat balanced it out with a $5-off coupon printed from the website) and mechanics who are more like salesmen.   When the oil change was done, the mechanic in charge of my car took me out of the waiting area and into their back room where he was trained to run through a computer-aided presentation of attempting to sell me every possible thing in their book. It gets awkward when you say "No thanks" more than three times and the mechanic knows that will continue to be your answer, but by company policy he is forced to continue running through his upsell script.  Also, I didn't appreciate the fact that there were a couple non-uniformed teenagers with hoodies on who were lurking around the service bay area. I hope they were not employees on shift.
5 Oil change was complete in a surprising 10 minutes, the staff was very professional and courteous, the waiting room was tidy and well air-conditioned, and they gave my car a thorough vacuum and window wash.  They did run through their usual upsell drill, but I have never had any oil change or car repair done where whoever it was, at Jiffy Lube or not, didn't put me through the upsell drill.  They honored my $13 off coupon (got mine in the mail).  This particular Jiffy Lube is a newer location, and feels more clean and inviting as a result.  Also, the location seemed less busy than others (or perhaps I just got lucky on timing).  I'd recommend this location!
1 My first visit to Jiffy Lube last year was okay.  An older gentleman helped me that day and was very friendly and answered questions honestly.  I do not take my car to Jiffy Lube all of the time, rather I also take it to Sears, though it is a long long wait there.  For times when I do not have half a day to wait for a car (like at Sears) I take it here.  Never, ever again.  I recently had a transmission flush here.  Several weeks later I took it in again and told them the engine seemed "noisy" lately.  They said they would add an additive to help with that.  $80 later I walked out and the noise continued that week.  I figured it must be something else going on.  I took it to a trusted family mechanic of ours and he discovered a filthy engine with "frothy" oil.  He said it looked as if my oil had NEVER been changed!  I had been changing it faithfully and using full synthetic oil.  Also, they did not perform the transmission flush as the mechanic saw the "line had not been broken" where they hook up the transmission line to their machine.  Proof they did not do it.  He said the trans fluid was also filthy and stunk, even though I had just had it "flushed", or so I thought.    I am not just angry but sad.  I work hard like anyone else for my money and come to this location for over a year now.  I wait in the waiting room with my little boy and these people knowingly are ripping me off and LYING as they see me sit their with my child.  Sick.  I will never go back and you should stay away as well.
5 Lightening fast service!
2 Price is ok, waiting room ok, they have limited services available despite a laundry list of options.. if O'Reilly wasnt next store I doubt they could get through an oil change
1 SO OVERPRICED.  The only reason I even considered giving it two stars was because I was in and out in less than 20 minutes. However;  The base oil change was $40. NOT including oil, which was an extra charge. I brought my car in with barely 129k miles, so I opted for the high mileage oil which was an additional $25. A $65 oil change is just asinine.  Plus to change the air filter they wanted $20. For what? Popping it out and slapping a clean one in? Please. I'll do that myself and save $15.
4 Quick service, helpful staff, not the cheapest around, but they were thorough in their work, and I was pleased. Had they been 15% less expensive it would've been a 5 star review.
1 Way over priced. If ypu have a coupon watch closely. They bait and switch. Quick service
1 I pulled in and asked for an oil change.   Ten minutes later they are tearing into my 2009 Suburban as if we agreed to something already!?  I hadn't been given a cost or told what their services were all about.   There was no costs posted in the lobby, they immediately directed me to, either.  They tried to tell me the oil change was over $40 but that the extra quart would be even more!?  Now correct me if I am wrong but my car takes the same amount of oil as any other average car.   Out of frustration,  I told them to button my car up because I was leaving.  Then the manager in glasses wanted to haggle over a better price, saying it would only be 10 more minutes.  Too many hidden costs and inspections at this place.   They suck you in to tie you down.  Then they hit you with price.   Not my first,  second,  third,  or fourth choice to do business at.
