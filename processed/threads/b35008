5 All I can say is WOW!! The food and service was amazing!! It's not in the best location, but the food is amazing!!!!!!!!
4 Yeah, this place is awesome. They're slinging fabulous grilled chicken with warm corn tortillas, thick, crispy, freshly fried tortilla chips, and super tasty pinto beans. I think this place will likely supplant El Pollo Supremo as my go-to joint except when I want beef as well.  The menu is very limited including chicken and a burger and that's it, but they are doing what most restaurants haven't figured out, that they shouldn't try to be all things to all diners, they just do the thing that they do better than the guy down the street does it.  Stick it, Colonel, this is finger lickin' good.
4 Poor, poor, Pollo Sabroso.  They have the unfortunate distinction of being in the exact same niche as the incomparable, untouchable "El Pollo Supremo" on University in Tempe, which means they are going to be directly compared to the godfathers of mesquite mexican cookery, and Sabroso is bound to end up in 2nd place.  But, that said, this place is good.  Quite good, as a matter of fact, and I would have no problem stopping in with my family for meals in the future, even though El Pollo Supremo is just a few miles farther.  I definitely think there is enough to distinguish Sabroso from its competitors to make it a unique experience.  Chicken portions are good sized and fairly apportioned (you don't get stuck with just a neck and a wing in a 2-piece meal), and very well cooked, but much more subject to gristly weirdness than Supremo.  The seasoning and style is somewhat different, too, and while I prefer Supremo's drier red-smoke flavor, I could certainly respect other's opinions that prefer the warm, moist and mild flavors of Sabroso.  Supremo is a dry but superb assault on the senses with smoke and sodium, Sabroso seems to aim for tender and moist succulence.    I think I dined here many years ago when it was under different ownership and the menu was all over the place, and the chicken back then was poor to fair.  Now, perhaps taking a hint from Supremo, Sabroso has signifcantly cut its menu down to the essentials (think whole chicken, 1/2 chicken, quarter chicken, and the essential sides and a couple quirky add ons) and that kind of laser-focus hopefully will keep them in business a long time as they perfect their chicken, and the Sabroso folks REALLY have improved the quality of the chicken compared to the last guys (Correatado?).    Sabroso does have some tasty sides, and a good number of them, and their salsa is quite special, although not quite as good as Supremo's cold-pureed salsa.  I especially like the smoked jalapeno, and I wasn't sure what to make of it at first, but when I was done I considered it to be an integral and awesome component of the plate.  Good stuff!  The beans and rice are on par with the best of any authentic mexican eatery.  I do think the folks at Sabroso are a bit more service oriented than at Supremo, so for the uninitiated, the overall dining experience may be better at Sabroso.  The guys at Sabroso actually seem to like to talk about their food and their concept, while the masters slaving over the red coals at Supremo seem WAYYYYY too busy and removed to deal with the little people.  Hey, artists at work, do not disturb!  The staff is friendly and informative at both places, but Supremo has more of a feel of a roach coach that just happens to be inside of a building, while Sabroso embraces the general restaurant and service concept better.    So, in the ultimate final summary of the Sabroso / Supremo Smackdown:  CHICKEN:  Supremo ***** Sabroso ***1/2 SIDE QUALITY:  Supremo ****1/2 Sabroso **** SIDE CREATIVITY:  Supremo *** Sabroso **** SIDE PORTIONS:  Supremo *** Sabroso **** LOCATION:  Supremo *** Sabroso *1/2 DESIGN/ATMOSPHERE:  Supremo ** Sabroso **1/2 SERVICE:  Supremo *** Sabroso ****  FINAL SCORE:  Its all about the chicken at these dives!  SUPREMO *****, SABROSO ****  But Sabroso is certainly highly recommended.  Skip your next night at Carlos O'Briens, Carolinas or Miguels and try something really special!  Bon appetit!
