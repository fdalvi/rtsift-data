4 This smoke shop is really small, but very well stocked. The staff is really friendly. This is a place i would not recommend bringing children (Due to the porn on the walls), but all your tobacco needs can be satisfied here. I knocked down a star due to them charging a convenience fee on debit card transactions.
5 Nice little, or I should say compact shop, it  has all you would want in it. The person  that helped us was very nice, helpful and generous. I really liked the colorful things he had, and user friendly...just what I was looking for at a good price. Glad to have them close by,  another plus. Def. will  Refer them.
1 Overall very unhappy with the service and the products. I purchased my first ecig here and at first the guy seemed helpful and knowledgeable. I spent $80 on the set up and the next day upon using my ecig it appears that it is not charged or is broken. I took the battery back and had it replaced, but again the same thing happened. Overly unhappy, I go back to ask for a refund and I was denied my money back. I contacted the manager AND the owner and no one ever returned my phone calls.  I ended up buying an entirely new ecig battery and chamber from a different smoke shop and have not had one problem since. I literally pissed away $80 for a crappy product. I will never go back!
