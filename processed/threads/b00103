4 I walked into this place and the following came to mind:  "In 1972 a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-Team."  I'll have to go back several times to look at all the stuff they got.  Floor to ceiling, wall to wall, there isn't anywhere you can look and not see something that could blow yer ass up, or at least hurt it real bad.    FUN!!!
4 Never thought to review a gun shop... anyhow, the owner was extremely helpful, as I am admittedly a novice when it comes to firearms. I picked up a 5 and 30 round magazine, a tactical bag (carrying case), and a couple boxes of ammo for my AK-47. He also pointed me in the direction of a few shooting ranges that are assault rifle friendly, since not all will allow AK-47, AR-15s, and the like.
5 Bought three guns from there.  The owner, Trig, probably not a coincidence to trigger, ws very helpful everytime.  Very legit and better prices than the Gander Mountain down the Road.  Would recommend!
4 Knowledgeable & friendly, you can't ask for more.
