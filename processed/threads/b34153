5 $5 shoe shine.
5 Francis always does a great job.
5 Go see Francis in the Golden Nugget's men's restroom located near the 24 carat club. (I'm being specific because most of the knuckle heads in that place don't have a freaking clue when you ask where to find the shoe shine guy). With over 30 yrs experience, he's a great individual who takes immense pride in his work. He only charges a few bucks for dress shoes, but he did such a wonderful job, I tipped him well. I recommend you do the same. He'll reward you with the biggest smile and gratitude you'll ever get in Las Vegas.  *If you've ever got your shoes shined @ Nordstroms you can really appreciate the work that this man does! I only make it out to Vegas a few times a year, but I wait to get my shoes shined by Francis rather than wasting my time and money going anywhere else!*
5 I went to see Francis yesterday at the Golden Nugget. My shoes were in such bad shape that I thought I was going to need a new pair. However, within 10 minutes, he cleaned them up to look like they were new.
