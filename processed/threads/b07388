5 Friendly, competent and fast. Its nice to find a competent mechanic I can trust.
2 Be sure to have the mechanics address everything on your list related to the quote you receive.  I brought my truck in for two issues.  One was resolved, but gained another problem which to their credit, they admitted screwing up and is now being fixed.  The other problem wasn't fully addressed and now will take more money to fix. Their response to me asking why it wasn't taken care of in the original quote was to say that "it should take care of the problem". They even changed their story about the diagnostics from what they told me the day before.  Told them I wasn't happy and was told I should be very happy as they saved me a lot of money. I'll acknowledge what they did to save me from having to get a new manifold was appreciated, but don't tell me you are going to fix the problems and then come back later and say they "should" be fixed when they aren't.  Sorry, but I will go back to Airpark Auto Service.  It's worth the 15 mile trip.  No shades of grey and definitely more confident about fixing a problem.  Sorry Cactus, but I won't be coming back.
1 This is an update to my earlier review. I happened to check my oil today and thank God I did.  4 QUARTS LOW!  Only three things are possible. 1. Oil leak  2. Oil burning  3. Insufficient amount of oil was put back into my truck after putting the engine back together. I'll give you a hint which two problems it isn't.  BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY.
5 I've taken my Corvette and F-150 here.  This place is top notch.  Dennis and Richard are great!  I'm mechanically inclined and still use their services.
