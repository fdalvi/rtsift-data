1 We had one of their contractors extend our driveway for a third car and the job he did was fair at best.  Not anything to write home about.  Not on time, not organized, did not follow through until complete; at the same time we had him put in a sidewalk on the side of the house and this was just as frustrating.  Not on time, did not show when supposed to, sloppy job, not level, did not take into consideration surrounding or existing items when framing walk. We had to do extra work on our part to make things work.  Now in all fairness we could have been a side job for this contractor, but you still need to keep your customer aprised of what is going on and show up when you say you will!  You need to do a PERFECT job even if it is just for extra money!!   I do not recommend this contractor.
1 Our HOA hired them to repave all of our parking lots. They tore up all of our lots and then suddenly raised the price by $100,000. We would have to pay an assessment if we allow that. It's been almost a month and our lots are still torn up and we are parking on the street. It is like Lord of the flies out there. People are parking on unsafe torn up asphalt. They are also messing up the parking for adjacent neighborhoods. It takes me 10 minutes to walk to my car in the morning. The worst thing is, there is no end in sight and there's so much disharmony among the neighborhood. I would give these people -10 stars that is how angry I am. Do not ever hire them.
1 Dynamite Paving is a Terrible Company! Do not do business with this company! They jack up contract prices by 50%. My advice stay as far away as you can from these rip-off artists!
1 Dynamite was hired to pave our condos over a month ago. All they've done is rip up all our asphalt so we can't park and then tell us they're gonna charged 50% more than their quote! They left the job and all of us are left with nowhere to park . For goodness sake never hire them!!!! I rate then negative 100.
