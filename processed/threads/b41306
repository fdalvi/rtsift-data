5 First time here for pizza and salad The only thing I knew before walking in was I know it's take home pizza...  The employees were very friendly and helpful, they executed their jobs perfectly It's a good thing I went on a Tuesday because they have a $10 Large pizza deal which was perfect for me  I got a Large pizza split in half Half was just cheese and sauce (boring) The other half was papa's favorite Papa's favorite consists of sauce, cheese, pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, mushrooms, onions, green peppers, and black olives... Sooooo good!   I also got a regular garden salad with ranch and the whole thing was about $14  The guy making my pizza (Brandon) was very nice and filled me in on the heating instructions as well as tips for my next visit  The pizza is super good and the salad is good as well :)   Ps- next time I want to try the cookie dough and/or the dessert pizzas
4 Take and Bake! Papa Murphy's is like the Subway of pizza, with the speed and efficiency of Jimmy John's. You order your pizza, and in a wink of an eye it's made right in front of you.   Baking instructions are easy, and the pizza tastes really good for something that is baked in a regular oven. Someday when we have a grill I'd like to grill some pizza and see how it tastes!  They seem to always offer coupons in the mail, and they also have family deals, as well as daily deals. Service has also been cheerful and friendly.
