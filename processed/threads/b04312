1 Dr. Kang is the greatest! I have been seeing her for about a year now and I absolutely love her. She is not only excellent at what she does, but she is a genuinely nice person. I always look forward to my appointments... well not the blood work.  That being said... the reason for the 1 star is all because of her office. I have NEVER called the office and waited less then 15 minutes on hold. The office is short, rude, and doesn't want to actually work. My other complaint is how long it takes to be seen. The office called to reschedule less then a week before me appointment because the doctor no longer works Mondays. Well the earliest they could get me in was 52 days later! I am suppose to see the Dr. ever 3 months and that would put me at almost 6 months between visits. I explained this and they said that the dr is very busy and they could do nothing.  I LOVE Dr. Kang but because of her office staff and her work load I have to find a new Dr. :(
5 Dr. Vadikuti is best !  She is very knowledgeable, nice and truly cares about her patients.  She is a real advocate for her patients.  She doesn't rush through her appointments.  The office staff are nice and friendly as well.  If you ever find a need for an Endocrinologist this is the place you want to be.
