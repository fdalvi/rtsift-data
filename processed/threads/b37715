5 Did a "Girl's Night Out" here and had a great time! All the supplies are included - even the plates and cups for our snacks and beverages!  A very fun and encouraging environment to try something new if it is your first time with a paintbrush!!
4 This was a fun night of BYOB fun and painting.  The concept is you can do one painting by yourself or do one half each of a whole painting with someone else, ie spouse, bf, gf, bff, whomever. We did a half of a painting each and it was really interesting how different each half is but yet the whole is connected.  I would encourage anyone that likes to paint, or has thought about painting, to give this a try. They'll teach you how to paint the assigned painting/picture for the night and provide all the color paints and brushes. No experience necessary. So bring your favorite bottle and food and get ready to paint!  You get to take your art home and display it on your wall. And proudly say, "yep, I painted that" - one step closer to being a recognized artist.
5 The ladies running our class were super happy and easy going. I can't believe we painted for 3 hours, it seemed to go by so quick. We were there for the POP Art your Pet session and it was truly amazing. I hope we can go back again soon! Way better then other painting establishments we have gone to and much more relaxed!
