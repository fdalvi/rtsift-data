5 Had a great experience! Hired him to take some photos of the recent storms and received an amazing print for a great price! This fine art photographer is someone I will use again  :) I have also recommended him highly to many friends for decorating their house with artwork! Thanks again jbphotographyllc!
5 I recently had JB Photography do some photos for marketing material that my business was putting together.  Jeff met me at a perfect locatiob for the scope of work we did.  He captured the greatest angles and colors.  the entire process from start to finish was extremely professional.  JB Photography will be doing all my work from here on out.  Highly recommend this company!!!!!!
5 JB Photography is one of the best! The husband and wife team were fabulous, flexible and very professional. I was so impressed with their concern to detail and knowing all the right positions, lighting, settings and backgrounds for just the right picture. My pictures far exceeded my expectations, and are some of the best I have had done to date. I would recommend them for any event, occasion or picture need. Great people to work with, and of course the pictures speak for themselves. Top notch all the way around.
5 JB photography is the best. They are flexible and very friendly. My pictures came out great. My whole family had a blast working with them and my husband is hard to please. We will definitely be using them again.
5 Jeff was a great photographer. His head shots were very professional. My wife and I will go back for some family photos in the next 3 months. I love that he is mobile and he'll go to the location I want him to go to. I also loved that he went from Chandler to Phoenix and back to Tempe for me.
5 JB Photography is wonderful!  My fiance and I hired them to do our Christmas card pictures.  They were very patient with us and our large hyper dogs!  The photos turned out wonderfully and I would definitely use them again!
