3 Not being gay myself, I couldn't get overly excited about Priscilla's when a friend insisted I go to some of "his" bars for once instead of always dragging him to George Street. For starters, from the outside it looks as if it's been closed down for about 20 years, although it does get a bit better once you get inside.  It was karaoke night when we were there, which apparently is every night apart from fridays and saturdays. But, unlike any karaoke situation I've ever found myself in before, nobody here seemed to mind getting up and potentially embarrassing themselves in front of a room full of people and so the whole atmosphere was really relaxed and friendly.  Although we were there in the evening, they open in the afternoons and do some basic bar food (paninis, pizzas, toasties, that sort of thing).
5 I went to this place for the second time last night and I absolultely love the place. The kareoke was the most magic thing about it. I will be going back there with friends and rate the place 5/5 and will advise the place to people in the future.
5 Went again to this place last night. ab fab agian. went up singing songs, drinking, dancing, it can not get anybetter.
3 I spent my honeymoon in Edinburgh. On our first night we met up with some local Yelpers, but we got down to Leith a little early. Not being familiar with our surroundings, we looked for the closest bar with a wifi sign and saw Pricilla's.  We're from a very liberal city, so gay bars are just as fun as traditionally straight bars. It was early--I think around 6:30--so there was only one other group in the bar.  The hubby and I drank a few pints of beer and chatted with the extremely friendly bartender, Jason. We discovered we had something in common--Jason worked in Texas for a few years and was familiar with some of our customs.  We didn't make it back to Priscilla's during our stay, but it was a nice place.
