5 Thank you so much Joanna! We love our henna's. you did a great job!  Awesome and interesting studio!!!!
5 Jenna does amazing work! I texted her at 11AM and she showed up at my house less three hours later without me even having an appointment or having met her! She was very personable and professional all at the same time!  Her work  is so fantastic! I showed her a picture from my iPhone and she did even better than the picture! I love her work and I will definitely be a repeat customer!!! Very quick and beautiful work!   If you are thinking about getting henna, she is definitely the person to see!
5 Amazing gallery and studio. Jason does the best tattoo work in town. He is also a very talented musician and painter, if you ever have a chance to see him play you definitely should.   Note: THIS STUDIO DOES NOT DO HENNA.
