5 Great quality and super fast turnaround! Thank you, will be back soon!!!
5 I have been using their services for a while now and every time they exceeded my expectations with both the time and quality. If you looking for a place to get your clothes adjusted to ensure PERFECT fit this is the place to go.
5 After trying to get alterations done for my wedding gown at David's Bridal and being told they were booked 8 months out, I went into a panic. My wedding day was only a month away and I had no idea who to call. Luckily, after hearing some great things about Top Tailoring, I decided to put my gown & trust in her hands... And I'm so glad I did! She shortened the bottom of my dress and brought in the bust flawlessly! Also, I'm positive I paid a lot less than I would have at David's. If you need professional alterations at an affordable price, Top Tailoring is the place to go!
5 I brought in a suit that I had purchased online as well as a sport coat that needed the sleeves brought up. Friendly service, quick turnaround (5 business days), appropriate pricing, and an absolutely fantastic job on the tailoring- everything was perfect. Highly recommended.
5 Several weeks ago I found a beautiful dress that was perfect except for one small hole at the bottom of the zipper. It was the last one! I had to get it.   I looked around online for tailors and was drawn to Top by the super positive reviews. I hot footed it to Gammon Rd and found my way to the small suite in a strip mall. Svetlana, the owner, is sweet and sewed it up right in front of me in about 45 seconds. It looks *perfect* and I am excited to be able to wear it soon! Great experience all-around.
