5 Great prices!!! I bought my queen size, pillow top mattress, box spring and frame for under $500. Small but friendly staff. The do offer delivery service every day but Tuesday and if you make it in early enough your bed can be delivered same day! There is an extra charge for delivery, however, because it is done by an outside company. I probably [hopefully] won't need another bed for a while, but I would definitely recommend Mattress Outlet to anyone who is in need of a new, but affordable bed.
1 I purchased a stress o pedic queen mattress a little over a year ago from this location. At the time, the sales woman was helpful, full of knowledge, and I felt comfortable spending a bit more for a better product from her. Now a year later....the bed is canooing, and incredibly painful to sleep in. Eventhough it came with a 5yr warranty, our friendly sales woman has yet to return our call. As a matter of fact, she's the manager. It doesn't look like we'll be seeing a replacement, or even recieving a call back about our $1,000 bed. Very disappointing to say the least.
5 This store really is worth mentioning. Because I have Spinal Stenosis, having a good mattress is critical - I did a ton of research this past week and realized the only way for me to have a good night's sleep would be to purchase a latex mattress.  I went everywhere - You name it. From Macy's to online stores. I knew what I wanted, but the price was critical as I'm on disability. Finally I found this store - they satisfied all my needs. I got the quality mattress I needed at the right price. PLUS - The sales person was NOT pushy - I could not believe my luck.  I had to make the time to write this review and hope it will help someone else? I would highly encourage anyone looking for a good mattress, at the best price possible, to visit this store.
