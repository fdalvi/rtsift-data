5 Dr. Loo has been my primary care doctor since moving to the valley.  He came highly recommended by a coworker.  His easy direct manner and interest in the whole picture of what is going on in your life set him apart from other doctors I have seen.  The office runs seamlessly which is a big plus in my experience.  I have actually changed doctors in the past because the front office and staff is difficult to deal with.
4 I found this doctor near my work via Yelp and Aetna, and was a little worried when I walked in; the TV in the waiting area had on Glenn Beck.  Was I a little scared? Yes. However, the nice receptionist was kind enough to keep me there.  The theme of everything is the Hawaiian Islands, which was nice and fairly relaxing.  I waited a bit longer than I thought, but I wasn't in a hurry, so that was ok.  The nurse taking my weight, blood pressure, etc was a little brusque, but nice enough, and then Dr. Loo came in.  He's nice, believes what you say (I'm a 24 year old with arthritis, 3 surgeries behind me and 4 to go, yet most doctors can't seem to understand that it is painful for me to walk), and had good suggestions. He actually gave me a PT script instead of making me find an orthopedist out here. I really appreciated it.  All in all, a good visit. Just loses one star for scaring me with Glenn Beck.
5 Dr. Loo has been  my primary care doctor since I was a child.  He is so kind and really cares about his patients.  I also occasionally see both nurse practitioners, which are both very attentive and compassionate.  If you're looking for a primary care doctor, I'd definitely recommend this office.  All the receptionist and nurses are very nice too!  He has a Hawaiian theme office, very calming when you walk in.
