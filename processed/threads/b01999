4 This is the fastest Wendy's ever! I've never had bad service and my orders are always perfect. -1 star because it almost scares me how fast the food comes out.  But if you're going to be eating fast food... there are far worse things to worry about. Speaking of which, Wendy's has a few good items for when i'm looking to grab "healthier" fast food. Their salads are loaded and tasty, I also like the non-breaded chicken tenders. But occasionally I just come through for a speedy Frosty late at night.. always meets expectations.
3 I'm a dollar menu whore.  One chicken sandwich please.  Here's your $1.09.  NEXT!   They want $1.98 or something ridiculous for a large soda. Next time I'm bringing my own $.25 can of pop.  The food is Wendy's.  Better than average fast food burgers (or $1 chicken sandwiches) I guess.
4 Good food, usually very fast, and a convenient location. I definitely recommend if you are looking for fast food
2 I haven't been to a Wendy's in a very long time. I used to love going to Wendy's as a kid.  My visit via the drive-thru was friendly enough. Nice staff member at the window. Fast service.  The food however. Ugh. First off I ordered a diet Coke and got a regular Coke. The burger was decent but there are better burgers at other fast-food restaurants now. The fries must have been sitting around for a while. They weren't very hot and were pretty soft.  Not sure I have a reason to go back again after this experience. I didn't go back and complain since I was on my way home and tired and didn't feel like wasting my time. I just through out the soda and most of the fries.
