4 Nice Chinese in the West End of Edinburgh. Bit tucked away but still easy to find. I mainly go here for lunch as it is close to our office. They have a fabulous Â£9 three course lunch deal. Good tasty food and friendly service. On the occasions I have been here for dinner the food was been good and the price is good. Lunch times (especially Fridays) can get busy so best to book. When you first come in it look like a small place but there is also downstairs seating.
