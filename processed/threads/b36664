4 I moved in my apartment in January and I love the location. I go to ASU and it is really convinent for me, plus it doesn't hurt that Mill is a cheap cab ride away.  I also have been treated very well by the girls in the office and I appreciate that! Thank you!
1 This apartment sucks. Do not move here! Agave used to be named with Villas and I have been living here since 2009. The most problem is that their free "air condition" did not work in the summer! Imagine how terrible it is. The room temperature is more than 80s in midnight and I have to take a shower to fall asleep from time to time. Sometimes the air conditions works well, but sometimes does not. Since my lease ends in March every year, which was cool and nice in Phoenix. I always forget how terrible it is in the summer and too lazy to move. But I will definitely move when my lease ends in March 2014. Do not move in unless you want to ruin your summer!
1 this is the worst place I've ever lived in, just finally finished moving out and now I'm being charged for things that were not my fault. Initially there were also lots of damages in the pipes and water leaked out in the hallways and in my room. twice. as well as my roommates room 3 times. that didn't bug me as much as the fact that it took them 3 weeks to fix it and even then they left the walls half completed. Now after moving out I'm being charged with not having closet doors when they didn't come with closet doors in the first place. plus management rotates so often its a new person in the office every month. WORST PLACE IVE EVER LIVED IN.
