4 I have been to this specific location four or five times. They have good donuts, the expected selection of beverages and snacks. They sell gas.   The thing that I enjoy about this Kwik Trip is the genuinely nice people that work here. I can tell the difference between authentic niceness and being polite because you think the boss is nearby, and these people are just nice. When I stood at the register, fumbling for my wallet while holding my very heavy baby, the cashier was kind and patient (not like the young girls at the grocery store who loudly click their nails - grrrrr).   The coffee is also quite good. There were six different kinds of hot coffee in carafes, not to mention iced coffee, slushies, and the 'cappuccino' machine. They have the sugar in a dispenser so I don't need to monkey around with opening ten little packets for my 12 ounces of coffee (don't judge me). My absolute favorite, though, is the machine that dispenses cold half-and-half. It is probably the kind with all the preservatives, but I get coffee here a couple of times a year and so can live with it. I just like the idea of pressing a button and getting cold creamer, as much as I want, right into my cup.
4 It's a Kwik Trip. It's good. They always have about 6 people on staff (why??). Bananas!
1 Ran out of gas, and my wallet was in Columbus.  I asked a neighbor to help me out, and they were willing to give me their credit card number to get enough gas to come come.  The Kwik Trip employees refused to run the transaction.  A manager was called, and the only way they would run a teansaction like that was to have my neighbor purchase a Kwik Trip gift card in lieu of using VISA card.  I was a loyal KT customer, but after this experience, I will no longer purchase so much as a pack of gum from these clowns.    Thanks for all the help, KT.  (eyeroll)
