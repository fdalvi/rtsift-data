5 Adelaide is great boutique!  You have to check it out.  I went in recently to find a couple of gifts for my friend's birthday.  There was so much to chose from.  And the best part is that they put it in a cute bag with a bow...so no wrapping.  I also bought a few items for my home.  There is such a variety of things to chose from, including clothes.  I also attended a painting night there, which was so much fun.  Ask to get on their email list, and you will be notified when they have an event like that.  It's really worth doing.
5 Such a cool, unique store. There are not any stores like this around. I am definitely becoming a regular !!
5 A friend of mine told me this place was awesome and that my wife and I should check it out.  When we walked in the first thing I saw was the Moscow Mule kit they sold (100% real copper mugs not the fake stuff.  They also have my favorite ginger beer Cock&Bull) which made me super excited.  For those of you wondering what I'm talking about a Moscow Mule is a refreshing cocktail made with vodka, ginger beer, and lime? Served in a super cold copper mug.  Anyway enough about that. This place is really cool all around with stylish, fun, and exciting items for both myself and my wife.  #moscowmule #coppermugs
