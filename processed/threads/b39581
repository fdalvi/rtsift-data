4 Right in busy financial district of Edinburgh about 200 yards from Princess Street. Very nicely done up inside and a great place to chill out after work while everyone else is running around looking for buses etc.
3 Popular even on a Tuesday night this branch of the chain doesn't differ significantly from any other I've been too but with a far lower ceiling than the George Street one the atmosphere manages to be more intimate. I'll admit to not being a fan of these places in recent years but either my tastes have changed a bit or they've been forced to charge more competitive prices by market forces because I now actively enjoy visiting them.    The tapas menu merits comment as well as the good Syrah Rose I had a bottle of. The menu's caught my eye in the past but I'd never eaten anything from it. The Avocado & Tomato Brochettes I had this week were well prepared, tasty & good value so a bigger amount of food from it will be tackled next time I think.
