3 Located SW corner of Cactus & 75th ave. (yelp map is incorrect).  Strip mall location, just a couple doors down from Subway.   Very cheap food here but decent for that price.  Crazy bread with sauce is hard to beat for $2.38.  Nice people working at this location.  Fair amount of parking.
4 This is walking distance from my house and I can only say the pizza gets better every time I go. The first time I came here was last year and I was disappointed, but they have redeemed themselves. I usually buy the supreme or pepperoni and cheese yum. I'm not comparing it to Chicago pizza, this chain had its own criteria.
4 This is good pizza when you consider the price and that it is meant to be for quick pick up. Let's not bother comparing it to other pizza places, because that wouldn't be fair. You'll never beat the price for a pizza like this.
1 I would give no stars if I could.  The kid who answered the phone did not listen at all after I repeated a simple order of 3 peperoni and 2 cheeses.  He kept repeating the wrong order and I kept correcting him,  My son ended up walking out of there paying for 6 pizzas and did have 6, but I again only ordered 5.  Go somewhere else.
