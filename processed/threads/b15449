5 Fast. Easy. Convenient.  They got me in for an appointment same day and I was out in 30 minutes.  AMAZING service!
1 I went to one of the temporary ones to get our 2010 and 2011 taxes done (had issues using Turbo Tax to file last year).  So after being quoted "around $200" to do each return, I decided, OK let's try.  My husband usually does it himself with Turbo Tax, but since it had issues with the first-time homebuyer credit last year and kept returning the forms, we decided to try a live person, and we figured $400 wouldn't be too bad.    Well, after spending hours there because the guy was so slow typing everything in- he kept making mistakes that my husband and I corrected- we ended up with a $579 bill.  Not sure how it happened- he said because we itemized, etc.  I don't know why we weren't quoted at a higher rate.  I left there feeling upset, cheated, and like a fool.  He tried to give us a $25 coupon, like that would really make a difference.  He seemed to understand that it was a lot of money, he said it should be free since I'm a teacher...blah blah who cares, I still had to pay almost $600 right there that I was not expecting to pay.   We will NEVER use a tax service again.  I don't care how desperate I am to get my taxes done.  I will trust my husband to do Turbo Tax or whatever, and if we miss out on something, fine.  At last I know I didn't pay some guy more than $100 an hour to type numbers into a computer.  What a waste.
