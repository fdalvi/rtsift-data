5 Who wants to see old lady boobs  (question mark)  Wet t-shirt contest Thursday night.  ..btw   why is this catagorized under 'dive bars' ..  how dare you.  this is my living room.  Many shitheads hang out in my living room, but being the good Buddhist that I am, I accept everyone.  Thanks for stopping by.
3 Doooooiiiive!  Great place to belly up next to bikers/tweakers/truck drivers.  But I digress, who am I to judge?
3 Oof.  Amber's in ain't no joke, it's a dive if I've ever seen one.  I've been here twice and both times and it was a buzz kill.  The drinks are cheap and the service was okay but it was a boring place without any appeal.
