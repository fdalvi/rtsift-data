1 Worse hotel I have EVER gone to. Went on a business trip with my hubby, who is a truck driver. We had a reservation that was placed by his employer and were denied because according the the unhelpful clerk, the person that set up this hotel proof needs to be present. And even after explaining the situation and handing him the confirmation printed out after reserving with an email attachment explaining the situation to the manager....the clerk says, "well when he comes we can give you the room." So for some stupid reason we paid out of pocket to stay in this Roach Motel (Literally). Once checked in, the room was out dated, dirty, smelly, etc... I am burning all the clothes I wore in this room out of fear of carrying any complimentary bed bugs. I wouldn't even wish my worse enemy a nights sleep at this sleezy hotel.
1 This place is horrible. The lady at the front desk was extremely rude. I called for extra towels and the lady at the front desk informed me that she was too busy to get us towels. She went on to explain that she could not help us, said shed see what she could do and in the same breath said never mind I can't do anything for you. Worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Shitty service and shitty staff.
1 Horrible place to stay asked for non smoking room smelled like cigarettes bad customer service wifi is horrible did not work kids running around at 2 in the morning up and down hall ways
1 Absolutely one of the worst motels in Phoenix....PERIOD. You will only receive 4 or 5 T.V. stations at best!!! And this is with cable...Definitely not worth a visit or stay...I won't even mention the Roaches!!! NEVER returning to this motel & I wouldn't advise you to either.....IM DONE!!!!!!
