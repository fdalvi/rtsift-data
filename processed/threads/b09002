2 Just a little dive bar!  This is a spot that we used to head to for a few beers at the end of the night when I lived in the neighborhood.  There are a bunch of Native American's that frequent this establishment.  The best thing about Playa Bar is they will package up a few brews for you to take home with you.  Not much to say about this old little hole in the wall.
2 I stopped in here last Friday night with some pals on a whim, as we all like to explore dive bars... It's hard to believe this exists in South Scottsdale - this place is strait out of South Phoenix! We are three "well-dressed" white guys and they were looking at us like we were General George Custer. It took the bartender awhile to even acknowledge us, and when she did charged us double the posted price for a Corona. We were obviously not welcome in here! We downed our beers and hit the bricks before the stabbings began. I like other South Scottsdale dives, and Indians too... but this place definitely didn't like us!   Tip: Try the Roadrunner over on Hayden.
5 The Playa receives 5 stars for the ultimate, unequaled dive bar experience. The Playa is the unmatched champion of dive bars. If The Playa were a Star Wars movie it would be The Empire Strikes Back. In all seriousness, if you are looking for a bar with cheap drinks, pool tables, sometimes a DJ but always a great juke box, and no effing judgements, The Playa is where you need to be. The bartenders are awesome and the bathrooms are clean. (and in case it gets too real, there are security guards)
