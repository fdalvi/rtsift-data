5 My kids did Summer Camp here and they had a blast.  They made LEGO movies and my 5 year old was able to make some robots.  They were more excited about this camp than the others we were looking at.  They also have classes in Summerlin and a number of Afterschool programs.
4 A place where kids can play while learning about gear ratios and potential energy? Sign me up! I hope they open one over on the east side, though.
4 The staff was very nice.  We went there yesterday for a birthday party, and they were very helpful and surprisingly aware of food allergies and the precautions that needed to be taken.
