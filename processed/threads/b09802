5 I love the Quiznos in our neighborhood here.  The owner of this Quiznos goes out of his way to ensure his restaurant is always clean, well staffed, and has fresh ingredients.  The bread is always fresh and the ingredients are as well.  The condiments are fresh and never out.  The air conditioning is really good to so when your hot in July you know it's going to be a nice lunch.  I highly recommend this Quiznos.
4 As far as a Quizno's goes this one is clean and the owner is very friendly.  I'm in here a lot since it's close to work and enjoy the food.  Gets busy around noon but the line moves pretty fast
4 I generally enjoy a sub from Quiznos, but they have to be made properly otherwise they aren't that great. Luckily when I have visited this location they have been pretty good about making the sandwich the right way and the taste results have been excellent.  I have had trouble with some Quiznos locations taking coupons in the past, but I haven't had any issues at this location yet, so I am happy about that. I also love their cinnamon sugar cookie, which I have to order every time!  One issue I have had here is that the soda machines have had nasty pop. Workers really need to stay on top of that, but otherwise I have been pleased with my visits here.
