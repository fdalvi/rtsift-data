2 I took Melissa's car to the dealer for service today.  After a few hours sitting in the waiting room and listening to light hits ranging from Kelly Clarkson to Enrique Iglesias my stomach began to grumble.  I perused the vending machines and initially considered going with the BigAZ Bubba Twinsâ„¢ Chili Dogs until I came to my senses and decided to venture out into the world in search of sustenance.  Across the street I spied what looked like ancient adobe dwellings.  As I got closer a sign indicated that it was the dilapidated ruins of Pappago Plaza.  Through my explorations of the prehistoric temple to the gods of home furnishings and strip mall bars, I was drawn to both the British Open Pub and the Hometown Buffet next door, but neither was right for a meal before noon.  Just as I was about to give up on my quest I spied a single word that drew me in...PIZZA.    As I walked closer I noticed the magic words..."2 slices for 3.99" and I was sold.  I entered the tiny hut and it appeared to be empty.  After a few seconds the phone rang and a tiny Italian man stepped out from behind a door.  He answered the phone and spoke something I didn't understand in a thick Italian accent.  After hanging up he asked me what I wanted, at which point I ordered one slice of cheese and one slice of pepperoni and a Pepsi.  After giving him my $5.27 he retreated behind the door from which he came and I took a seat at one of the 2 tables in the cramped and poorly maintained hut.  After a few minutes he returned with my slices.    The slices were good size, but smaller than typical New York pizza with a thicker and softer crust.  I went in search of spices (a must for any good Pizza joint) and found only red pepper and parmesan.  Disappointed, I started with the cheese slice.  It was a bit on the chewy side, sort of like a poor man's Hungry Howie's, but was very bland and without the flavored crust.   As for the pepperoni, they were limp and soggy and tasted like some dog treats smell.   By that I mean it's intriguing to the point where you almost want to eat it, but you know it's not a good idea.  Luckily they were easily removed to convert it back into another bland cheese slice.  The best part was probably the crust, which was soft and tasty and could have been great with the right dipping sauce.    I returned from my quest having not discovered any hidden treasure, but at least alive and with a full stomach...which is more than I can probably say if I had gone with the chili dogs!
1 Dude. BARF TIME.  FIRST of all, I ordered for delivery. The delivery driver got lost and I ended up having to walk down to the corner to meet up with her. (I still tipped her because I'm not a total dick, by the way).  I ordered two pies, one with pepperoni/pineapple and one sausage and green pepper. At first glance, I thought they messed up my order and put pepperoni on both, and forgot the green peppers. When I looked closer I discovered that their sausage is small and sliced thin, like pepperoni. I also discovered teeny tiny slivers of green peppers, about an inch long. Each topping, and we're talking by the piece of topping here, had about  a 3/4 inch of cheese between it and the next topping piece. So the place goes stinge-o on you in regards to dressing a pizza. Also, the crust was soft and flavorless. Tasted like a cross between a wheat tortilla and the cardboard box it was sitting in. (Please note, this was NOT a whole-wheat crust.) And the next day? The leftovers were so bad they went into the trash. Not a fan.
4 It's a small space, brightly lit and somewhat barren.  A couple of wobbly ceiling fans waved to me as I entered, and a short, friendly man popped out from behind a tall counter.  He was a nice guy, super eager to please.  I waited a little while for my pizza, and it appeared that the short man was the only one on duty, and most likely always is.  Turns out they deliver, and the menu shows an offering that expands beyond the restaurants misleading name of Pizza to the second power.  The pizza is actually quite good.  It's blatantly apparent that the cheese and sauces are higher than average quality.  The prices are decent for a pizza shop, and they have a few specialty pizzas that help strech your dollar.  It's a fun and simple atmosphere, but don't let the rundown appearance distract you from a tasty meal.
5 The Best Pizza is now at Teatro Pizzeria in North Scottsdale. It is not to be missed. The Pizza maker has been brought over from Rome, where he has been making Pizza for Oder 30 years. It is located in the Summit Mall on North Scottsdale Road.They make calzones which are to die for. You must go!!! open for lunch too.
1 Being an avid wing fan lover I am one to go exploring in search of the best wings in town. And boy, this place was not it! Upon ordering, an Italian man which I believe was the owner was rude and seemed like was not satisfied with his job. I asked for 20 wings for $16 which I thought was a bit high. After retrieving my wings I payed the guy and seemed like he wanted me to leave a tip. Well excuse me, I only leave a tip if the service was great and I actually got served. No the wings were " to go" so no tip left. Now to the wings, man they weren't good at all. They were dry, overcooked, and sauce was not good at all. Seemed like store bought franks red hot as I got the medium wings and BBQ sauce was bland as well. Overall service and food needs to be improved and I "may go back." Disappointed yelper! :(
5 If you're tired of the same old Pizza Hut, Papa John's, Dominos pizza all the time, give this place a try! Owned and operated by one person so its clear he doesn't advertise well or have a website, and the place has a bit of a dull look. To be honest I've never dined in here. I always take my order to go. The place is empty most of the time and it's sad to see he's losing all the business solely because of lack of proper advertising. That's the only reason I can think of because the food is excellent. I go here at least once a week! The cheese they use is spectacular and the gyro specialty pizza is a must try! TRY IT AND YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. I hope this place thrives because honestly, I'd hate to see it go. Btw, for those concerned, their meat is Halal!
2 Alright, the guys who work here were all very friendly; however the food was terrible. We got meatball subs. The meatballs were crusted over from either frying or sitting out... Not sure. The fries were too salty. I wouldn't go back.
1 $9.99 delivery fee through Orderup.com. Seriously?
5 Just received a delivery order from a super friendly guy from Piza Pizza.  Great hot wings and mozzarella sticks!  Prices were great and I'm impressed!
