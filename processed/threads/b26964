1 So tell me, why would you own a self serve dog wash and not let people with hairy dogs use your services! Makes no sense to me. I think Principessa pets, Poochy Kleen, or The Soggy Dog would be much better choices!
2 We normally go to another self service dog wash to bath our two dogs but we decided to try U Shampooch because it is closer to our house. The owner was very nice and helpful but they don't offer the same things that our normal dog wash does and were more expensive. At U Shampooch is costs $14 per dog and only comes with shampoo, towels and the use of a dryer. Not worth the money for what you get.
2 I went to Shampooch about 2 years ago and had a wonderful experience so even though I can wash my dog in my shower, I decided to "treat him" with a spa treatment. My back thanked me too.  The cost was 18.00 for my golden and I would have been happy had the shampoo not been so watered down, I really don't feel I was able to really get my dog clean no matter how much I used. Had I known that the shampoo was going to be really watered down, I would have brought my own soap.   The owner made a couple of rude comments. I ignored him AND won't be back
