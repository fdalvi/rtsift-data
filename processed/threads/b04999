4 The best store for personalized gifts!!!! I have been to a few different Things Remembered stores and this is by far my favorite location. I come here a lot for personalized gifts, I have gotten everything from baby gifts, wedding gifts, mother in law gifts, birthday gifts, anniversary gifts, they are great for everything! I recently took in a really nice bottle of Perrier Jouet Champagne and had it engraved for a wedding gift. And they did a wonderful job of course, they always have a fast turn around. The staff is really very helpful especially the petite african american girl with bangs, I am so sorry I forget her name but she is a sweetheart and I always try to have her help me with my gifts! Nicest staff I have had from any Things Remembered store! I will continue to be a loyal customer!
5 Over the years I hae purchased many items from blankets, flask, and picture frames.  I have always been very pleased with how they have turned out and the people reciving the items were also pleased with the end result.  Will continue to shop here.
