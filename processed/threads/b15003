2 The location is convenient for me and the prices are good, but that's about the extent of it. The employees always ask if they can help but honestly ... looking at their hair and nails, I'm not sure that I would feel comfortable asking for their assistance or opinions. I know that's an awful thing to say but is the truth. If I'm in a salon or beauty supply store - I want to know that the people use the products, have good hair, and resemble some sort of "beauty". Fried hair, penciled eyebrows, beauty-school dropout doesn't make me feel confident.   I've belonged to their club for several years and pay to renew every year but it seems that the one time I forget my card, WEIRD, ... they can't find me in the system. They can't find me by address or phone number. I promise, that information hasn't changed. I've talked with several friends that have said they've had the same experiences with different Sally stores.   It's really no wonder ... the place still uses dial-up. Good grief.
5 I've been shopping at Sally for a couple years and have always had good experiences.  Today I received exceptional service and I had to let folks know.  I came in with a question about gel nails (Gelish vs. IBD).  The lady who helped me called one of her other managers who is a certified nail tech to ask my questions.  They were extremely helpful and went above and beyond what I would expect.
