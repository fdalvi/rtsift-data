3 Corner Pizza is a decent place to grab a decent pizza, and the prices are pretty good as well, although there are other Pizzerias in the city that do give better value for money. However, if you live local, then it's a great place to go to. The restaurant does not do deliveries, but if you call them up you can pre-order a pizza so that is ready when you get there.  When I came here I ordered a 12" pepperoni pizza and it was Â£6, which is pretty good, although the pizza was more greasy than normal and I used a tissue to absorb areas of excess grease.  The drink prices here were also pretty expensive so I decided to go to a local off-license to get a drink there instead. Corner pizza also do other food items as well, such as kebabs, burger, chips and a range of Ben and Jerry ice creams.
4 It's not the most healthy food in the world (but takeaways rarely are) but it tastes great and the service is friendly. We often pick up last minute meals there with the kids. They love choosing the toppings. Great value too.
