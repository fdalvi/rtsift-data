3 it's a school, enough said. not sure what they are teaching in there but my nephew comes home saying things like " that's COO" or "uncle i'm gonna be late for SCHOO" .
1 The only retarded district that doesn't test 4 yr olds. My daughter can't go to school because her birthday is on October. That's messed up, how can you deny a child the right to go to school and learn. Her preschool even says she should be in kindergarten because she knows more them any other student
5 This is not a review of school district but response to reviewer Manny I.. Deer Valley is not the only school district that goes by Birthday cut off date, by far not the only school district... And I don't see how smart your daughter can be if the word "retarded" is part of her father's vocabulary!!! There are a lot of words you can use instead of that very ugly term.
