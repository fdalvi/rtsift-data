5 Don't make the mistake of setting your GPS to this location in hopes of coffee or confections - not a store, just the corporate office of a great company.
5 Love the food!  Flavorful and healthy.
5 I picked up a small catering order at Wildflower today.  I have been going to the restaurant for years.  They have done a terrific job of reinventing themselves time and again.  The meal I picked up went to friends who were waiting for their father to come out of surgery.  The salad was perfect!  They cut up the sandwiches into 4ths.  It tasted great, and the service was even better.  @quinterogolf.com
4 Ate here for lunch the other day. Was quite impressed with clean decor, friendly/helpful staff, and great sandwiches!  Tried the Almond Tuna sandwich with sprouts - soo good! If you love lots of sprouts, you'll be pleased with how generous they serve them. Tried the Brie sandwich and it was tasty as well.  They may consider ramping up their staff for lunchtime rush. Also, pleased that it's in such a nice location.
