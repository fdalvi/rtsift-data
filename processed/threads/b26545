5 Its a warm and very inviting shop to walk into...  Quite unique with beautiful clocks lining the walls by the front entrance.   We were exploring all the great shops on Main st and came across this one.   My husband and I both enjoyed exploring the wide variety of items in this shop.  They carry some really nice bronzes, along with clocks and lots of other things.
4 If you're looking for antique clocks, this is the place. I've never seen so many beautiful grandfather clocks! There are parts and pieces for clocks everywhere! They are not the cheapest parts, but they look to be of fine quality. The man who owns the store was very friendly and informative.   I came for the antiques, and I must say that this place is stocked to the brim with amazing antiques. If only I'd a bigger budget and a way to transport some of the things he sells. I was looking for a nice antique lamp. They have lights of all sorts for sale. Everything is beautifully aged. Being antiques, they are pretty expensive, but if you're looking for authentic antiques, this is the place to be.
5 great selection of clocks and other fun vegas collectibles.  pricey but reasonable for the pieces they have.
