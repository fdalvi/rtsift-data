2 Located inside Fashion Show Mall This rating is for store employees and the store. Store was very nicely organized, clothes folded.  However as for the staff, they lost major stars when it came to this: Went here 2 weeks ago while on vacation.  During the weekday it was pretty quiet, lots of great helpers asking if I needed help.  However when I was leaving the store, I was a bit disturbed by the last 2 staff hanging by the door.  This guy leaned over to kiss one of the employees on the lips.  At first I thought ok, maybe it's her bf visiting.  Well turns out this guy is one of the employees as well!  As a customer, I believe PDA between 2 store employees is a big NO NO especially while they are on the clock and not greeting customers as they should be!  (Sorry, but the last 2 employees made the store loose major points.)
1 First of all, why don't you carry swimsuits, all year round? Or at least, keep it in back-up supply. For a city that is plagued by tourists, it seems like it should make sense.  Two, it's pretty much the rudest encounters I've ever had from A&F staff. I get it, it's Vegas... but really, you work at A&F in Vegas. What, you couldn't swing it as a cocktail waitress? I'm sorry, you are a Vegas reject. I'm used to dirty looks, but not ones complimented by fake tans... usually just heavy foundation. Get over yourself.  The store is laid out well, but as it goes a lot of that doesn't matter to A&F - when you come looking for something. Everything is hidden in the dark! I went home, took a cheese grater to my jeans and got over it.
3 This store is huge. There is a good selection of clothing for men and women. The staff is not friendly or helpful. I love coming here even though the service is not so great because prices are so much cheaper in the mainland compared to Hawaii even with the 8% + tax rate. This store seems to have more selection than the other AF location on the strip at the Forum.  ^_^*~
