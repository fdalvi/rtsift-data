5 Harry Jacobs is amazing.  He found stuff on my credit that wasn't even mine.  Then he got it removed.  I'm now enjoying excellent credit,
5 I had some unethical company I had NEVER done business with put  a negative on my credit.  I called Harry Jacobs of Credit Restoration of Nevada and he had it removed within days of my visiting his office.  Very Happy!
5 Had an idenity theft issue 4 years ago and contacted Harry Jacobs who instructed me how to get it resolved thru the financial institution that had posted on my credit report and did not charge me! They could have charged me but said I owed nothing. Great Company!
5 After being screwed over by a local credit repair company, it was great to meet an honest man in the business. He was very knowledgable about the field. He looked over our credit in detail and was honest with us that that our credit was something he could not fix.  It was great to hear honesty in this credit repair business because every scam artist out there will tell you they can take off things off your credit report when they can't.  Would highly recommend going to Harry Jacobs at Credit Restoration of Nevada.  You can expect professionalism and honesty.
5 and to think I found this guy online.    He is a straight shooter who won't promise what he cannot deliver.   I had the worlds worst credit until Harry and his minions got a hold of my profile.   It's shameful I had to go through a half dozen companies in this line of work to find one who wasn't out to only make money for themselves but had genuine interest in their clientele.
