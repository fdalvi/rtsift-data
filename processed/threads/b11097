5 went there to buy a pair of shoes for mom. the staffs were super nice while i was there and answered all my questions. very satisfied experience.
1 I wouldn't give then even one star. I came to buy a pair, but the attitude of sales people made me change my mind. I was adviced to buy shoes here for its know comfort, but truly I ll take my money somewhere else. Very disappointed, it was supposed to be a quick purchase.
5 I've had one pair of SAS shoes that I only use occasionally because the soles are wearing out. My left and right shoes are different sized. The salesperson was more than helpful and explained they can special order left and right to fit my feet. She opened about 6 boxes to make sure to get the right size. She also offered to clean my existing pair and explained that when my new shoes came in, they can send in my old pair and get new soles for $65. The shoes are expensive, but now I can buy one pair of shoes instead of two! She offered to get some water for us too. Could not have been a better experience!
