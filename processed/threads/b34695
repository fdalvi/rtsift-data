4 A business lunch at a college cafeteria? I was a bit skeptical and then surprised.  The ambiance is nice with a modern contemporary feel. The salad bar is great it even had hummus and couscous. There is always a vegetarian soup and other option as well. They do have hot meal items too, on this day it was pizza, burgers, fries, a pasta with red sauce and cheese, and macaroni and cheese.   There is also a wide array of drinks and deserts, some were novel to us, like a rice crispy treat made with trix, this is a diabetic coma served 2 cubic inches at a time.   All of this for just $9.  and it is all you can eat.  Another pro is the calorie info posted by everything.
3 Breakfast: Four stars. Lunch: Three stars. Dinner: Two stars.  But really, if you're going to eat here, go eat breakfast here. They have delicious egg dishes and Sriracha. And you can preview the food before you swipe/pay for all-you-can-eat.
5 = = = = = =  DAILY LUNCH BUFFET!  = = = = = =  Question:  OMG, where has this STELLAR Buffet been hiding??  Answer:  RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES IN THE MIDDLE OF DOWNTOWN!!  The starting point for me here is that this is a candidate for best Buffet in Arizona & my favorite of any restaurant downtown, & there are a lot of good ones around here!  Remember the great 5-Star Marston's Buffet (R.I.P.) just 4 blocks down the street from here?  Well, this is the same thing except that it's TEN TIMES AS BIG FOR HALF THE MONEY!     :-))  Today Taylor Place here featured a BIG selection of about 150 food & (included) beverage choices.  Every bite of what I ate was just terrific, from the Albondigas Soup to the great salad bar, various sandwiches, meatloaf, chicken, pizza, custom made omelettes, you name it.  Now you DO want to be a person with a sense of adventure to eat here, because it has a screwball serving area layout and a mix of help-yourself and staff-served dishes such as at Le Village Buffet in Las Vegas.  Also, the dining room is a unusual, with stainless steel tabletops & a high ceiling making it a little loud & with an echo about like the Sweet Tomatoes Buffets on Tatum and on Power Road.  You'll live.  It's quieter inside than Portillos & we're not going to stop going there!     :-)  The staff is friendly & the Lunch Buffet is only $8.35!  (They also serve Breakfast & Dinner Buffets!)  With its much larger food selection & much lower pricing, these guys might just beat the holy grail of Arizona Buffets, Wandering Horse, & just think of THIS:  Both are "RUN BY THE GOVERNMENT!!"     :-O   :-O   :-O  Hey Iain!  Oh what a special place this is, & I can't wait to come back!  The menu varies daily & they're Vegan friendly.     :-))
