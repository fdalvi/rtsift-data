5 Excellent design work and the email marketing program is the best on the market.  They do it all in terms of online marketing and won't blast you with crazy monthly fees like some of the others in town.
5 Great email marketing service!  Lots of useful templates, and the service is easy to use.  Great reporting, too!  If you email to clients, use Firedrum!
4 Needed to put together an email blast for a soon-approaching performance and tried Firedrum. I found it to be very easy to use, and I loved getting a clear understanding of how many people had viewed my invitation. It's the best way to go if you're trying to build a fan base and want to keep track of what works, and what doesn't. For the self-employed, it's great to have something work right, and not take up valuable time ramping up on 'How To'.
5 I have used several other email marketing platforms and none of them compare to the ease-of-use provided by FireDrum's program. I am a huge fan and have plans to convert ALL of my clients over immediately! I'm also excited to start using some of their other marketing services for my PPC and social media campaign management. I'll update my review once I do!
