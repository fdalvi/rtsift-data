3 I ordered food from this place through the Dine Inn menu from the Marriott Courtyard. They delivered with a minimum purchase. I believe that was $15 or $25. The food was average quality. Not the best, but not the worst. It was a little overpriced, but this is expected for Las Vegas.
3 Milanos is pretty good, they have decent sized pizzas and a variety of other food available. However they aren't consistent. I first ordered during the Super Bowl last year and it was amazing and the staff was very friendly but the next few times I went the pizza would be mediocre or amazing. It's hit or miss but it's still better than some other places I've been to.
1 Ordered this pizza for a party, we all thought it was average pizza at best on top of their rude customer service. Won't be ordering again. Also, refuse to do business with these jerks, they won't stop sneaking in our gated community and soliciting in a non-solicitation zone. Called and politely asked them to stop soliciting our neighborhood and they refuse to stop. This business will suffer due to bad customer service and a lack of respect for its surrounding community. Lots of better competition to choose from too.
2 One of these menu's made its way to my room at the Motel 6. I should have just tossed it into the trash, but I couldn't drive anywhere and ordered a Stromboli and a Greek Salad. Now, they say Stromboli on the menu, but this is clearly a calzone I think. Ok, it is in the shape of a calzone, but was missing the Ricotta cheese that is always found in Calzones. I guess its a cross-over thing, but anyway the crust tasted like a Croissant pastry. If they use that for the pizza, then it will be trouble. THe mozzarella cheese was decent inside, but veggies were overcooked and that pastry crust shell was tough to get past. Salad was just regular with feta tossed on top. Move to the next menu if you see this place and $2 delivery charge.
