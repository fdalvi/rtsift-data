5 These guys are awesome!  Their cabinets are the least expensive that you can find anywhere and they look amazing!!!  We redid our whole kitchen, including granite countertops for less than half of what other people were going to charge. When they (1 guy) come to install, it is done quickly and perfectly, and in my case, in just 1 day. I cannot say enough good things about everyone at West Coast Cabinets. If you need new cabinets or counters call them. They could not be friendlier or more helpful.
2 For what we got and the price, a 4 star was in order, but...   The installer left EVERYTHING behind and just walked out of our home when he was done. 15+ large Boxes in the front yard, all the left over materials were strewn about the kitchen, sawdust inside all cabinets. The job was not complete; I had to do it myself. The area above the sink and fridge were not finished by the installer. Fortunately he left the materials behind so I could finish.   The granite installers dinged an area of the wall between the microwave and oven, so I get to repair that as well. I was ready to give the installers a C note each, but the workmanship kept me silent at goodbye time.   Joe did call when I complained. He offered to send someone out to fix the problems, but I did the work already.
1 Don't waste your time. First, we went to their store to look at countertops with interest in having cabinets done also. One person was there, Josh who didn't know much. Based on dimensions I provided, the price for the counters would be $2,500 according to him. The owner John Joshes dad, came to my mom's house and told us his kid was wrong and he would give us the quote for the entire job in a few days. Thirty minutes after he left, I had a question and called, but only could leave a message. I called again in a couple more hours and could only leave a message again. That was three weeks ago and he hasn't called back. To me, that's rude and not good business.
