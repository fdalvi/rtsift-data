5 My favorite model train store in Vegas. Just about every Friday after work, I stop by to see John and Dee.
2 Being new to Las Vegas, I was excited to visit Westside Trains. I am an experienced model railroader, so maybe my expectations were too high. When I entered the store the person at the counter never even said a word to me. I guess customers are not that important. There was a lot of Lionel trains, but nothing really displayed very well. The HO products were few and basically for beginning modelers. Very few structure kits and certainly no craftsman kits. Equally lacking was any scratch building supplies other than a few plastistruct items. I always prefer to support local businesses, but it looks like I will have to go back to using online stores.
5 Went to this store in pursuit of my father's new N-scale train hobby.  The staff was awesome and, though they had a small selection, they showed us everything they had and made suggestions on our project.   We went there specifically for N-scale magazines which they had- and even had a few back issues that we bought.  I love to support local small businesses like this and this place is definitely on my "return to" list.  Thank you Westside Trains!
