5 Came here instead of Starbucks to get some much needed study time... It's too hot for coffee.. Close to my university ... Has all things berry healthy... I personally ordered the Berry Fulfilling w a free energy shot... Free!! I'll take berries and free any day.. My drink : all berry and only 150 mere cals..& filling.. Actually felt like dessert.. Awesomely sweet staff..
3 consistant service.  No bells or whistles to keep me from going out of my way to get to this location.
5 Great service and great smoothie!!  Yummy!!
3 I love this place but i had a shot of wheat grass and was not as good as the locations in Campbell California. It was small too and the orange was frozen that was given with it. When I tried to bite it was all ice and hurt my tooth. Good thing I'm only visiting. All your locations should have the same products and be just as good!! Service was great though and very welcoming! Might just want to check your grass!
