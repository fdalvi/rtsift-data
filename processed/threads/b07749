5 This was probably the best Jack experience I've had.  It is a tradition I have with one of my girlfriends to grab a couple tacos after a show or some drinking. Basically, just a late night.  We pulled up at something like 3:30am.  The guy at the drive through was ridiculously nice. I'm still talking about how nice he was 3 days later!  They still had their shake machines running. They ran out of whipped cream for my friend's shake so he asked if she wanted extra ice cream or cherries on top. We said go for it! Gosh, we got extra ice cream & like, 6 or 7 cherries lol  Oh yeah, & the taco's? Fresh. Stuffed. Hot. Greasy. GOOD! Why do we like these mini coronary inducers? Guilty pleasure. My friend & I agreed, these were better than other Jack tacos we've had.
3 Double Check your order, usually correct but have had to take in a few items.   Not Bad and Super close
5 Went in barefoot without incident, the staff was very courteous.
1 Drive thru chick named Kylie wouldn't take my order because I wanted two separate orders at 1 am. Both very small and simple, with one car in the drive thru other than myself. What a joke.
