4 Route 44 cherry slushy with extra cherry juice at 9pm. Cost me $2.09 and such a treat it reminded me of I what state I was in!  Had the trip been any more stressful, I would have put a little (or a lot ) of vodka in it and then I would have more to say!  Nice service and great drink!
2 I ordered 2 slushs. Got my total, drove up to the window to pay. Waited for 4 minutes and they opened the window to say "we are out of slushes" ugh, why couldnt they just tell me that to begin with
3 Cherry Limeaid YUM enough said!
3 Love this place. A nice way to stay hydrated in this heat.  My only complaint is, the charging for ice water. WTH, I mean I never ever just order water. I always get my daughter her fav "blue pop" (ocean water) and some sandwhiches, I just always order an ice water for myself & think it is a crappy/unprofessional thing for a biz in this hot state to charge for water!  I always keep change in my car, so I can tip the kid a $1 even when using my debit card. The kids are always nice, not their fault company charges for water in AZ.
