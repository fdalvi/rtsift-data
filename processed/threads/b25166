5 Robyn has done our taxes for two years now.  She is professional, thorough, and very easy to work with.  Her hours are flexible and we were able to do much of the paperwork virtually (but securely).  Her rate for tax prep is incredibly reasonable considering how much she was able to capture for us and how knowledgeable and detailed she is.
5 My wife and I visited Robyn about a month ago and got solid, no nonsense tax advice from a very knowledgeable CPA.    If you have ANY questions about Federal or State taxes, Robyn is the CPA you should be going to.  Not only is she knowledgeable, but she's willing to take the time to help you understand the advantages of various parts of the tax code.  (She actually thinks taxes are kinda fun! How weird is that?)  I'll definitely be using her as a counselor to my family and small business in the future.
1 In my experience I found her not to have the level of knowledge and expertise expected.  Suspect either poor listening or poor comprehension skills as she researches and answers questions not asked, while failing to respond to those actually asked then charges both meeting time and research time.  Initially found her to be basically competent in elementary tax matters (ie turbo tax or other software might do just as well) but would suggest seeking expertise elsewhere if your situation has any degree of complexity or variance to vanilla 1040.
