3 YEEE FRIGGIN HAAAAWWWW!!! Another wonderful bar establishment that the Casa Grande area has to offer *no sarcasm* This place was nicer than the Airport Tavern at least and the bartender was pretty cute too! She's a rookie and it was a slow night but she was very nice and poured love into these drinks! THANKS BABE! Oh yah, I dare anyone to challenge her to a game of pool! She bring in her own queue SO WATCH OUT, she's not shabby. My over all experience was pretty good. I haven't been to many place in Casa Grande but this place is one that I may visit again whenever I'm out there since there's really not much more there that I know of...   ***Da Bafroom: AWWW DAAAAMNNNNNN! I've been in outhouses nicer than this crap hole! Take care of your bidniz #2 in advance. Bidniz #1 well, as guys, we'll go anywhere so it doesn't matter...   Welcome to Casa Grandy Folks! Yall come beck ageen nah ya hear?!?!
2 For a dive bar in a one-horse town the Silver Bullet is well, pretty much the only option other than the bar at the hotel I was staying at, which closes pretty early.  Drinks were at a pretty average price, but the locals were a bit routey and eventually got into a pissing contest over nothing, puffing their chests out like a bunch of drunken insecure.. well you get the drift. It was pretty creepy though, I came in with two girls and we were getting eyed down pretty bad. We didnt stick around too long before a bunch of our friends made it before the tension in the air got too thick.  I did enjoy the fact that there was no music playing though, I dont know about you but Im sick of bad music being on everywhere and too loud at that. I get enough of that at the hotel lobby!
