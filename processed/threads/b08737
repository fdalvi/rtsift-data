5 I don't normally review corner markets, but I have to here. They have build your own 6 packs of craft beer for 8.99! They also have their own growlers of rotating craft beer which you can refill and buy the growler bottle there . Great selection of cigars and cigar boxes as well.  Love the back corner which has some nice to tobacco pipes.  Every ting is iry! :)   If you need some good beer go to cactus and the dude behind the corner is awesome! Such a great guy who is super nice.
5 You would never know it unless someone told you, so I'm going to. You can get growlers of a lot of good, local beer in here. They have Papago's orange blossom, a lot of the four peaks beers, etc. They are different every week I think so there's a good variety. Cheap, too.
5 My boyfriend and I used to live across the street from this place. There's a circle K right by us too, but we would ALWAYS go here. The owner is so friendly and remembers us every time. Super awesome beer selection and a build your own 6-pack for super cheap. Good prices, friendly staff and super convenient!
