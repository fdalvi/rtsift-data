4 Hard to rate a McDonald's well.  I go through the drive thru most mornings for coffee and will eat lunch there from time to time.  Drive thru service is always great and restaurant is always clean.  They hire and retain good help.
5 This might be the best run McDonalds in the Madison area. The drive-through runs incredibly fast! Plus, it's a throw back McDonalds with a displayed old milkshake machine that triggered Ray Kroc's involvement in the company, and resulted in him bringing in a franchise model that facilitated the restaurant's world-wide domination. However, who checks for a McDonalds rating?
1 I ate here on Dec 1st (big mac combo) and it did not feel well after words. I learned that they and all Mc D's use ammoniated beef, it is frank'in food. Madison is full of privately owned restaurants that serve real food, not chemical and byproducts dressed up as food. Save your kids, save your self. Just say no to the evil fake food
