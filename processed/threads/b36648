5 I recently put a Salt water system in my home. I bought the unit from a company called Pool Thing here in Scottsdale. Wow! it is fabulous. My pool looks cleaner than it ever has, swimming seems so much easier and lighter for some reason and, pool Thing after all the research is the best. the people were easy to work with and they really did everything to make sure we were happy. Highly recommend.
5 My pool thing was installed 13 years ago and the cartridge went bad because the previous owner did not read how to take care of it. After making some inquires Alan Auerbach contacted me (found the original installation records) and troubleshot the problem in an email. We talked and ordered the new cartridge and he offered a free service call if that wasn't the problem. He even hand delivered it to my office and gave me his cell phone if I needed help installing.  Install was easy and system works as advertised. Not more chlorine tabs!  Outstanding product and even better customer service!
5 We also had problems with an older model of the Pool Thing so took it in for repairs. We had to replace the cells but they did not detect a problem with our original power supply when they inspected the system which resulted in a delay in delivery.  However, they then provided a digital state-of-the-art power supply at no charge to replace the original power supply. And even delivered it to our home. Thumbs up!  We really like the system. This past summer we didn't shock the pool even once, and relied only on the generated chlorine. And we have 4 dogs that are contantly dragging dirt into the pool.
