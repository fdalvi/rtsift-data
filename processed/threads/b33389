4 My favorite morning coffee place at the T2.  The folks here are friendly and do not have the typical "I work at the airport and have been beaten down about the head and shoulders" attitude.  So yes, service here is friendly!  Plus, they take some pride in the product and make coffee that I think they would also drink.    Here is to the Coffee Bean!  THANK YOU for waking me many times each month on my flights out of T2!
5 The best HAZELNUT flavor drinks of all kind here!  I got the regular ultimate hazelnut and it tastes exactly as I remembered it when I last had Coffee Bean & Tea in Honolulu.  My absolute favorite coffee shop!  As a gift, I also picked up some of their pom & blueberry tea packets.  Perfect to take back to the office.   Two people were working.  One was taking orders and prompt to greet people.  The other was making drinks.  There was about 5 customers and the service was quick and friendly.    Drinks and the level of service is consistant with all their locations.  Even when its out of state.
2 After going on two three hour flights without coffee I was desperate for the nectar of the grumpy morning person.  First coffee placed I passed in terminal 2.  Thought I was going to get a good cup of joe but not so much.  If you want brown water, here you go.  If you want coffee try Paradise Bakery a few yards down the terminal.
4 Much better than Starbucks. Their ice blended drinks are far superior  Just a more comfortable atmosphere. Better during selection.
