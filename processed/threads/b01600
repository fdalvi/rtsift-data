1 I vow to avoid this store as much as possible. Smugness is not a virtue yet some of the employees at this store can teach a class on it.  I did shop here knowing their prices were high yet it was convenient.   Yet due to their employees poor attitudes, other stores will get my business.
5 Great people. Everyone is very professional and helpful.
3 They have a meatless section! Although there's a sign on the board, there really isn't a lot of selection for vegetarian alternatives in the frozen section. Was a little underwhelmed when I saw the sign -- I thought maybe I had found a little frozen vegetarian paradise. Turns out that's not the case.
3 I usually go for their dairy products like gallons of milk, eggs, and yogurts.  Friendly staffs and helpful employees.
