1 Nice place, but everyone there was extraordinarily rude. The patrons and the staff treated us like second class citizens simply because we are in the 20-30 age bracket. Ageist people are horrible to see, let alone interact with.  Aside from that, the room was nice. This place is significantly out of the way, so if you were planning on doing anything within Phoenix, stay somewhere else.  EDIT: We discovered a few days after staying here that they charged us for an additional night that we were not there. Upon contacting the company, it sounds like they do this to customers a lot. As a result, I have downgraded my rating.
5 Excellent food; excellent service; wonderful ambiance; view was very enjoyable!  We very much enjoyed our dinner here.
