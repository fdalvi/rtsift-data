5 Sephora, my love affair with you knows no limit.   Went in here to get my boyfriend his new favorite shave cream after I bought him a sampler and he ended up loving the one product. We looked on the shelves and they did not have it in stock but I asked an associate close by if they possibly had some in the back. She ended up opening a drawer underneath the products (awesome) and handed us not the tiny tube we were going for for $14, but a giant jar that ended up being $22. Spectacular.   Boyfriend left me in the store (possibly because he knew I would pay if he did....) to my own devices, and as I was perusing some skincare one associate handed me a basket, and another one came up and told me about a new skincare rewards program, and even ended up getting me some personalized samples for me and the boyfriend. She was extremely helpful and even said the shave cream would count for the skincare rewards. When I went to check out, the shave cream actually didn't count but they gave me the stamp anyways. The woman at the checkout also let me know what my beauty balance was with my Sephora Beauty Insider card, and wrapped up the shave cream and samples I got nicely.   Usually I exclusively shop at Sephora online due to coupon codes and samples galore, but this visit showed me that human interaction doesn't completely suck. Having 4 different and helpful associates was above and beyond amazing and it is really hard not to love this store and all it has to offer.
5 This is the best Sephora location. The ladies who work here are soo helpful. I just love Fatima..she has the best customer service ever! Got my freebie for my Bday..another place you must sign up to the email rewards program. It was eyeshadow/mascara/liner. Mini sized..but free! They know once I get in the store I will buy something. And I did. Splurged on a beautiful Lancome lipstick. Lov it! They always hook me up with free samples to keep me coming back! And I will!
5 Sephora is like Toys R Us for grown up women... and maybe some men too?? They do have a nice selection of products for men. But for most women, being left alone in Sephora with a credit card is like letting a child loose in a candy store... The possibilities are endless! There is so much to choose from, including Sephora-only package deals from companies like benefit and Urban Decay. Sephora is also the only place to get Make Up For Ever products.   Sometimes, I like to be left alone to shop and other times I want assistance. I love that the salespeople at Sephora accommodate me regardless. I never feel like I can't find the help I want, nor do I ever feel like I am being pressured to purchase anything... even when I sample every possible color.   Oh the sampling! Probably my favorite part of Sephora, I love that I can sample anything I want before I try it. ANYTHING. And not just checking the color on my hand, but actually applying it as I would at home to get a true feel for the product. Want to sample the perfume? They don't just do the silly 'spray a piece of paper' sample system here, no, not Sephora. (Perfumes smell different on different people, and different on people then they do on paper) The lovely salesperson actually created a sample for me by taking some from the sample bottle and putting it into a little plastic vial. Perfect for me to take home and use a couple times to make sure I like it!   Pricewise, Sephora is very fair for what they offer. The samples and great sales they have from time to time make Sephora my go-to makeup shopping store... The Sephora Beauty Insider card is a must. I have no idea where mine went but that is ok, the friendly staff at Sephora are always more then happy to look me up in their system and credit my account so I can get more freebies.
5 I love the Sephora at this location! It's so much better than fighting the crowds on the strip. I needed to stop by to get some necessities for a trip I will be taking soon.   I already knew what I wanted so there was no need for help this time. I walked straight to their Benefit section and found the Erase Paste it works like magic! Then I went in line and was looking at all of their last minute impulse buys by the register and I was happy to find Rosebud Salve in a tube! It's so much easier to apply then the one in the tin ...perfect for traveling! I also like their frequent shopper program you can earn small sample items or regular sized items depending on your points.This trip I opted to save my points for something bigger in the future!
5 Since I was shopping @ TS I had to stop in to Sephora. Thankfully my favorite sales girl Fatima was there. She is amazing. She showed me all the new products they have out for the holidays. I just love shopping there when she is working. I went there looking for the new Kat Von makeup and was not that impressed. So I actually left Sephora empty handed! There is a 1st for everything! I did find some wonderful things to put on the ol' Xmas list for hubby tho..
5 I'm a guy...and I love this place. Nuff said.  Okay, too short of a review so here goes.   Sephora in Town Centre is my choice of Sephoras in Las Vegas. Convenient parking and slightly dog friendly easily drew me in. The staff is extremely helpful and talkative even when you're just running in for a quick refill on cologne.
4 Though I've been to Town Square lots of times, I hadn't been inside this one until last night. Spacious, bright (they're always bright inside), and many associates dressed in black to assist you (had several people ask how I was doing but there weren't too many customers late last night though). I must note that there was a man working there who had nice makeup on. (It's almost like MAC, when the employees all wear makeup (even men) and it all looks so nice on them.)  I don't know why but it felt like this one was missing inventory because it seemed smaller; for example- the natural/organic section was comprised of two small back-to-back aisles (Pacifica is becoming an organic brand that I like). But then again, it could feel like that, because there was just more space than usual. (The one I go to the most, at Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops, is smaller, more compact, but there are way more customers in there.)  I do love the Sephora Beauty-In-A-Box collections like the Lip Gloss for $40 (on sale for $30 on the website but not at the store BTW) and the Fragrance Sampler for $50 (retail value is $100- you get samples of various fragrances and a certificate for a full size one only redeemable at any Sephora store- such a great gift idea BTW).  When these stores first opened up in LV, I couldn't leave without spending $50 on a single trip, every time. Now, I have a little more restraint and can actually just go in to browse.
1 If I could, I would give Townsquare Sephora 0 stars but it requires me to put atleast 1 star.  This Sephora is the worst place I have ever been to. So, I buy a gift card for my aunt from here for a Christmas gift.. and me and my aunt go shopping 2 weeks later at Planet Hollywood Sephora and we use that gift card and find out that NOTHING is in the gift card, no $$$!!! That whole time I feel robbed from them like they took my money, wasted my gas to get all the way there and did not give me anything in return. So I went rushing to Townsquare and stormed into the store and they said "well we have to check the camera if you really purchased it". The whole story is too long to tell but this place sucks, shop at another Sephora if you can because this one has a dumb worker that does not even know how to put in money in a gift card, pathetic...
4 Unless you've had a bad experience with an employee I honestly can't imagine a female not enjoying herself here... Make-Up,Perfume,toiletries,nail polish galore.... I can appreciate a place that helps people feel better about themselves...This store is pretty big but at the same time full of stuff. My daughter and I love spending hours smelling all the perfumes and trying on different colors of lipstick ,eyeshadow ect.. on our hands.The staff has always been very helpful and courtious to me. They have a brand new line of Hello Kitty items like a big silver Hello Kitty container that has various make-up brushes in it,Silver Hello Kitty Compact,Hello Kitty perfume.. I LOVE HELLO KITTY!!!! So this line I am in love with... There is also a hellah cute Tokidoki Make-Up line with crazy colors-LOVE IT!!!!  On your B-Day you get a free Birthday Cake Shower Gel and it's a good size too....                    **Sephora+MommyDaughter=Fun Quality Time**
1 Went in here last night. The selection was great, and people kept asking if we needed help. However, when I did, I didn't get it. I was trying to buy a bottle of cologne for my boyfriend and a pretty black girl with a spiked faux hawk asked if I needed help.  I asked her about the cologne because they were out of the size I wanted...she opened a drawer and there wasnt anymore. I asked if perhaps they had any in the back. She said maybe but did I really want her to look in the back? Um... What?   "Do you REALLY want me to look in the back room?" *Sigh*  I said I guess not and walked away.  Its cool, I will just order it from somewhere else, and I wont be back.  Dont hurt yourself chick.
5 I love this Sephora!  It's not really crowded, the staff is super helpful, they have everything I need, and they always give me free samples when I use my Insider card.  What's not to love?  There's a gentleman who works here who wears full makeup and is actually extremely helpful with suggesting products and general makeup advice.  You might want to seek him out if you are looking for new products.  He's kind of hard to miss.  Don't be scared... he's a sweetie!
4 There are three things that keep me coming back to this Sephora: location, location, location. Kidding-sort of.   Of the three Sephoras in town, this one is the "Mama Bear" in terms of size (Grand Canal Shoppes location is the Papa Bear and the Miracle Mile Shops location is the Baby Bear), but accessibility to the Town Square location is a breeze compared to the other two. This is all relative though because we know that Town Square can be a mad house, but the fact that you don't have to hike 8 miles just to get to the store gives this store a leg up over the other two.  The staff at this Sephora has been super helpful, sometimes a little aggressive but that's any Sephora. If you don't want to get trapped, arrive knowing what you want or else it's easy to find yourself wandering through the store with a basket full of items you didn't even know existed (and aren't even sure you want by the time you get home). The beauty of Sephora is everything can be tested-lotions, lipstick, toner, nail polish...everything! I've been known to embarrass my friends by trying a different color on every nail, but thanks to this method I have several of their OPI for Sephora polishes which I highly recommend. They have Sephora-exclusive colors with OPI quality, so if you're a cheap at-home manicurist like myself then a trip to Sephora is worth it!  Some of my other favorite products are Fresh which makes for the most part plant-based ultra good for you cosmetics and skin care products, Philosophy which makes some of the most smells-good-enough-to-drink products ever and Frederic Fekkai an amazing line of haircare products. ALthough none of these brands are exclusive to the Sephora chain, you'll be hard pressed to find the vast selection of each brand they carry anywhere else.   Overall, Sephora is a product junkie's playhouse and even if you're not you'll likely find products that will make you a life time fan.
4 Sephora is like a puppy store. I want to take everything home with me!  This location at Town Square is particularly great because of its size and accessibility. It's got a parking garage and metered parking right next to it, so you can get in and out if need be.  But for those of you who like to browse and sample, the employees here are helpful but not bothersome. Sephora is pretty pricey, so you have a few options to ease any buyers remorse. If you don't like your purchase, bring it back and return it. To prevent the extra trip, ask for a sample. You can ask a salesperson for a sample of (almost) anything in the store.  My suggestion: join the Beauty Insiders. It's their free loyalty program that includes special discounts, offers, and free gifts BOTH online and in stores. You earn points for purchases that you can redeem for deluxe samples that are ever changing. And if you spend enough, you earn the status of VIB (very important beauty insider) that comes with enhanced perks.
4 sephora has everything i want and need. ahhh!!! every little girl's dream was to play makeover. this is the store to buy anything from makeup, hair care, nail care etc. unlike ulta, sephora carries more higher end products. but worth a visit. staff is incredible and try their best to answer questions and fit your beauty needs
5 Really love this place!  I used to go to the Sephora at Planet Hollywood during college.  I'm so happy they have added another location.  Parking is much easier at the Town Square location.  They have everything!  I think I could lose an entire afternoon walking around sampling everything!  My husband and I were planning on going out on Friday night so I decided to get my make up done.  I normally get my make up done at Fashion Show Mall at one of the department stores.  I've been there upwards of an hour and a half getting my make up done.  The woman that did my make up at Sephora...40 minutes tops!  That included her writing everything down for me and getting the products I wanted to buy.  And I loved how I looked!  Her name was Maria....very sweet woman and very fun to talk to!  I wanted fake eyelashes.  I wish they could just put them on for you but there's a store policy that states they can just help you do it.  Overall, it went well and now I know how to do the eyelashes myself.    In the future, I'm definitely going back here and having Maria do my make up!  Don't forget to ask for their "Beauty Insider Sephora" card...earn points for rewards when you buy makeup.
4 I absolutely love Sephora! This location is my favorite since I don't have to go all the way to the strip and it's easy to get in and out. I've been here multiple times and the staff is always helpful and friendly. I'm like a kid in a candy store at Sephora!
4 they have some of the best advice and i really enjoyed myself there.
3 I have always loved sephora.  Love the atmosphere, love the products.  They only get 3 stars from me because I either feel like the staff is very very helpful and pleasant sometimes, and at others (especially in the evenings) they seem as though they don't want to be there and seem to pay more attention to eachother, and less to their customers.   Wish it was more consistant.
5 I can't give this place any less than the max because this is my second home in Vegas.  The time I've spent here can't  compare to any other place I've been to (besides XS).  Im no make-up connoisseur but this place excites me because theres so much to be discovered.  It's well lit, organized, spaced out and inviting!  This store is also filled with ready to help employees, without being overly bearing of course.  I've experience this at other Sephora stores and it's one of my pet peeves.  Since you can easily spend a lot of time in a make-up store, the last thing I need is someone hovering over me while I have fun.  This one, however, you're always greeted with a hello, asked if you need help, and make their presence available when you're ready for it.  Like others have said, parking is a+++!  This Sephora is easily accessible and not such a journey to get to like the Planet Hollywood or Venetian location (although I think it's awesome that the Venetian has a whole section dedicated to Make Up Forever, as its one of my favorite brands!!!).  This location has a good selection of products too.  That's a plus because it makes it a convenient one stop shop.  Don't like it?  Changed your mind?  No worries, just bring it back for a full refund with receipt or store credit w/o one.  I love this policy because when it comes to any beauty product it's all trial and error.  Having the option to bring it back really brings comfort when you end up dropping well over $200 for things you probably don't even need.  This brings me back to how much I love this store!!  I can never walk out without purchasing anything, even if its something I can do without.   *Quick tip: Do take advantage of the beauty insider card.  There's no charge and its quick and easy to sign up for.  You get a ton of perks, especially once you become a V.I.B.  Every time you make a purchase you collect points that you can use to redeem featured products.  They have 100 and 500 pt. giveaways.  Anyway, happy shopping, and say hello if you happen to see me in there... because I'm always there. haha =P.
4 Recently had the most excellent customer service experience at this Sephora and could not help but sharing. This location continues to be my one-stop beauty shop, always facilitating the purchase of no less than 4 new nail polishes each time. Seriously, I could open my own salon based on the collection I've acquired from Sephora alone.   Popped in here a few weeks ago to get a lip gloss from the Fresh cosmetics line, but they unfortunately stopped carrying it in store. The second sales associate who helped me, was really knowledgeable in that cosmetics line and offered me an excellent alternative. She took her time helping me and made a few suggestions before letting me check them out on my own. Her name was Dulce (sp?) and she was incredibly nice, not pushy at all (the employees on the floor can be a little aggressive, which is a turn off).   I came back yesterday and she remembered me-when does that happen?! As much as I come here, it's nice to see a friendly face who I know I can count on when I walk in!
5 Town Square is home to what I consider the best Sephora location in Las Vegas.  LIGHTING: Its large without being overwhelming. Its extremely well-lit. And there is even some natural lighting from the windows as well. All girls who love make-up know that natural light is the best light. With every other Sephora in town inside of a casino shopping mall, TS is the only location that offers this luxury.  CUSTOMER SERVICE: I've found that Sephora in general has excellent customer service. I've never met an unfriendly face or rude associate. Everyone is always willing to help with make-up application, recommendation, or anything else I may need.  SELECTION: They've never been out of something I was looking for. All the brands I shop such as Dior, Korres, Urban Decay, Nars, MUFE, etc have always been in stock. I can find anything I've ever wanted here. Its really a one stop shop.  RETURNS: When your spending a pretty penny on make-up products, sometimes, you make the wrong choice or get a bad color. Returns here are hassle free and Sephora is always willing to make sure you are 100% satisfied with the products you purchase. And if your not ready to purchase, ask for a sample and any of the associates will be happy to package up a small bit for you to take home.
5 This is where I go to get my orgasm, and sometimes my super orgasm.  Seriously, Nars Orgasm and Super Orgasm are my illuminators of choice and Sephora carries the entire Nars line. They also carry Laura Mercier, Stila, Benefit, Make Up For Ever, Shiseido and every other high end line you can imagine. I love the Sephora brand of brushes - very soft and luxurious.  This location is better than the Planet Hollywood or Venetian ones because you don't have to park and walk a mile to get to the store. It's also larger, definitely larger than the baby Sephora in the Meadows Mall in Penney's.  The girls in here are extremely generous with samples -- if you see something you want, let them know and they'll scoop some into a little container for you to take home and use for a while before purchasing.
5 Location: Town Square Mall (an outdoor mall)  If I ever need some make-up, Sephora never fails! Especially this location since you don't have to worry about going through the casinos shopping mall and long walk from the parking structure just to get to the store!  Excellent customer service - very friendly and were not shy about giving you samples! [***insert happy face here***]  This location always has something that I need! Other locations always seem to have run out! Eeeek!  Overall - I'll be back!   P.S. - Sign up for their Beauty Insider Rewards program (it's free and you get free samples on your birthday!)
5 I love this place.  Any time I need make-up, this is the first place I think of because of its selection as well as super-helpful staff and Sephora Beauty Insider gifts!  The store has so much to offer and the associates have just as much information to help you out with!  It can definitely be intimidating with the huge size of the store, but fret not - employees are great at what they do.  Though I've been here several times, the last visit was in mid-December to pick up a Christmas gift.  We got a Too Faced palette and some brushes as a first timer's make-up kit and everything was so easy to find and the lady who checked us out even said it was going to be a great gift for what we needed it for.  I love their samples!  OMG, I have found SO many great things from those alone.  Try them!  NOW!  Especially the Philosophy face wash.  I loooveeee it.  P.S. Your male S/O may decide to wait outside as there's not much for dudes to do in here.  -;)
4 I went in the other day on my lunch hour to take a look at some nail polishes. I was first greeted by a woman giving out samples! Score! After that though I was overwhelmed, which showed on my face, and an assitant was soon helping me find the right area to find the polishes. I took a look at the huge array of items when another assitant was there to ask if I needed help. Again, I did and she pointed out some to help with growth and even tried some colors on her own nails so that I could see what they looked like. I picked a color and the strengthener and then decided to look around. Another employee offered me a basket, then another asked if I needed help. I politely declined the further assistance but felt like now everywhere I turned there was someone else about to ask me. Sure enough, not two minutes later I was asked again by yet another employee. I finally decided to leave since I really just couldn't take it anymore.  I would have given 5 stars except there really is such a thing as too much good customer service. I would have loved to have just had a chance to look at products on my own.
4 MY HOME! As a girl, you know I love my beauty products. Haha.  This Sephora is always well-kept no matter how busy it is and if anything looks like it is out of stock then the employees always check for me.   My only gripe is that when I wanted to try out the Bare Minerals line, the make up artist who did my color match completely put the wrong color on me. I had to wait until she walked off to scrub my face with make up remover and go re-apply my make up.  If you are a Sephora Beauty insider (free membership), then be sure to save up your points since they do not expire and you can get some deluxe sized samples. If you are interested in any of their products then the ladies will make you miniature samples as well.
4 I love that they have this store in Town Square, it makes it a lot faster trip than going to Plant Hollywood. The girls that work there are helpful, but what i LOVE about this place is their return policy. If you do not like the product you can return it (fast & easy) no questions asked. You should pick up a Dior Lipstick Addict while your there, my favorite! lol
5 I love this place, where else can you go and try EVERYTHING! I don't get stuck buying something that sucks, because I've already put it on my face and know that it's perfect. The staff  is super helpful. They listen to my ranting and answer my ridiculous questions. They've used all the products so they have actual experience with them! I want to live here. Seriously. It's clean and wonderful and GREAT
5 I love Sephora! Like many fellow Yelpettes mentioned, this is like sending a kid into a candy store with a credit card. I am a make up lover, but I also like to try new skin care and hair treatment products. Sephora is great about giving out samples so that you can check out the product before you commit to the (generally) expensive price tag. I can never get enough of NARS, Urban Decay, Dior, Stila and the list goes on! This store is always neat, organized, with plenty of merchandise in stock. This is the only store in town I was able to find Urban Decay's highly coveted "Naked" eyeshadow palette a while back.  In addition to great selection and my love for make up and all things girly, the service here has always been stellar. I have discovered many great products by having the sales people take the time to figure out what I am looking for and sending me home with some samples to try before i buy. My most recent discovery --thanks to Sephora's great staff -- has been the Ojon Damager Reverse hair treatment which is working WONDERS on my over processed, dry hair.  I will continue to spend my money at a store that not only provides plenty of options when it comes to the merchandise, but also cares about their customer's needs and satisfaction.  Ulta's customer service could take a lesson or two from Sephora's staff!
5 Well Catherine Addis made me look beautiful for my wedding I know people usually doesn't just go to sephora for make up, but I knew I could relay on sephora to look beautiful, she was funny and friendly but didn't smother me at all she thought me how to apply make up, I was under the impression that it was expensive but it's completely affordable I'm for ever thank full to sephora and Catherine for making me look beautiful, she is my hero, no joke my pictures were stunning thanx to u I'm forever grateful I found you girl you are good they are very lucky to have you there!!!
4 Greta place to shop for all your high end beauty needs. I tend to buy most of my products else where but every so often I need that one item that only Sephora has, or it's cheaper here. They also have a great club card that accumulates points that you can trade for specified items.you also get a free gift for your birthday! Staff is always helpful and pleasant, willing to help you with any questions. If your unsure about using something they may be able to give you a sample to try at home.
5 Applied for a Beauty INsider card. Like a bonus card to accumulate points. Also for bday gift!! Thanks Chris, awesome customer service love going to Sephora; one stop shopping for many different brands. Samples, samples... just ask before you purchase something.  Guys just think of it as a Home Depot and you have aisles upon aisles of everything you need.
5 Excellent location (Its always RIGHT THERE no matter where I seem to park...), I'm a fan of Town Square, so I like this particular store. The employees are very nice AND not too pushy to help you like they can be at other Sephoras. For being a beauty insider, you get a free birthday gift (usually a small sample), I really wanted the sample item that was being given away and another location that's closer to where I live, ran out. It wasn't worth driving across town for, but I felt bad for missing it. I wasn't in a Sephora store (this one!) until well over a month later and when I mentioned it, the associate was awesome and gave me the free sample anyway!
4 Customer service here is great.  EVERYONE who doesn't have something to do is always trying to help.  I think I was asked 5 times in the first 5 minutes of being there. But I finally caved in and said "yes I need help."  I went in for a new foundation and powder and wanted to be matched again for the correct color because I am lighter then I was in the summer time.  The gal that helped me was very nice and showed me a ton of different options but I went with my original brand.  I was a little annoyed when I told her I needed a powder as well and she kept asking if the foundation was all I needed.  Sorry, but are you not paying attention to what I am saying!?  I did appreciate it when she was showing me my options, she didnt just show me the most expensive products.  She actually showed me things I would be interested in.  The store is very clean and well organized.  Its a perfect location in Town Square, smack dab in the middle with parking very close by.  Sephora has many different brands of makeup, skin care and perfumes to chose from.  This is really the only place I shop for makeup.  Easy and prices are decent.  SIGN UP FOR A SEPHORA CARD.  You get points every time you buy something and you can use them and receive a gift.
5 These people know customer service!  I first went there with two of my girls after happy hour at Yard House.  I bought a few things the sales girl suggested and got a Sephora Beauty Insider card.  This is a frequent flyer card where you earn points towards free products.  Since I started getting their emails, I scheduled a make up application with one of their color specialist on a Saturday.  First, I spoke with my color specialist, Sharon, about what I wanted to focus on and the colors I liked.  She brought over a skin care specialist to washed and masked my face.  She provided me with recommendations regarding my skin type.  Then, Sharon worked her magic.  She was friendly and provided instruction throughout the application.  After it was over, we discussed the products she used and she helped me with recommendations for other things, like brushes.    90 minutes and $270 later, I had a whole new makeup look.  Now, I feel more polished and professional for work.  It gives me more confidence.  And you don't know decadence until you try Guerlain's lipstick that comes with a mirror that pops open when you open it.  I'm in love!  I'll be back to get my skin care products.
4 I am fairly new to using make-up for the face. Although I am well-versed on eye make-up. Every time I go into a store to find products that I might like, I am always timid and uncomfortable because of how particular I am. I have sensitive skin, a dark tone with reddish undertones, and I know exactly what looks I like. It doesn't help that make-up associates tend to be vultures when it comes to newbies and I always end up going home with items I specifically stated I did not like. So, when I came into Sephora last night, I was prepared to have an uncomfortable experience. I was wrong.   Elisa, the sales associate who assisted me, was very personable. She listened to what I wanted and made suggestions. She showed me several products and helped me test them. When I seemed uneasy about anything, she was quick to garner my feedback in order to move to a more appropriate product. Elisa went above and beyond by showing me the proper way of applying the bronzer, blush, and highlighter. (I was looking for a contouring set). She even suggested the best brush without my having to ask---not in a sales-y way, but like advice your best friend would give you. After we found the best match for my skin, she gave me a sample of her favorite scrub (Since I have sensitive skin, testing a product is essential so as to avoid a break out or major irritation).   The best part of the whole thing? After we found my contouring set, she asked if I needed anything else and after hearing that I wanted to continue browsing for other goodies, she left me alone. But not without assuring me that she would be available for any other questions I had or products I wanted to try out. And you know what? Because she made me so comfortable and I didn't feel pressured: I walked over to the brush display and bought the brush too.
4 The store is clean, well-organized, nicely lit and usually playing some nice upbeat music. I have fun trying out the products before I buy. They have my favorite brands like Urban Decay and Tarte. You can even take home any perfume as a sample to test.   I have a terrible allergy to an SPF ingredient found in many cosmetics so one of the store's young ladies helped me find products and carefully read through ingredients. On top of that, she gave me tips on how to apply my makeup. Grab a rewards card to take advantage of the free sample beauty products when you accumulate enough points. You also get a great little gift from them during your birthday month even without a purchase. Quality makeup can cost a pretty penny so make sure to keep an eye out for sale items.
2 Walked in...guessed I don't fit the criteria of a paying customer in this place. I've had a review like this before , but it happens to fellas such as myself from time to time. I walk in, employees look dead at me, I say hello and they say hello, but offer me no help or direction.  Walk straight over to the perfume get what I needed and got rang up. Walk out with my bag and the looks I got were a little friendlier from the staff up front. Lovely location, smells nice, easy to find perfumes...but didn't get offered any assistance.
2 I love Sephora for the range of products they offer, samples, awesome return policy, rewards program, and the opportunity to try before you buy. But whenever I come to this location I struggle to get any help from the sales associates. They're either too busy and understaffed, or preoccupied chatting with one another about some gossip, obviously too busy to help. The last two times I needed a new foundation, and when my sister needed assistance picking a new one as well, we have had to do our own color matches. It would be nice to get some input from a make up expert, especially when buying $45+ face paint, but we simply couldn't get some one to help, or even acknowledge us. Also they're frequently out of stock of MUFE HD Foundation in 118 and 120, and going to another location just for foundation is a pain in the butt.
4 This is my favorite makeup store (and favorite location)  The staff is always friendly and helpful. I used to be exclusive with Mac and Clinique, but Sephora lured me with their huge selection. I love the eyebrow pencils from Anastasia and the BB cream from Boscia (self adjusting shade for all skin types), but my two all time absolute favorite items are Buxom lip gloss - it will change your life. I use Dani most often but I've flirted with other shades. And Givenchy Rouge Interdict. I'm not sure if that's the color name.. It's kind of a glittery white/pinkish color, at $25 per tube it is very, very expensive, but it has lasted me quite a while.
5 The best makeup and beauty place EVER.
4 Sephora is great whether online or in store. This is the most convenient location in town for me. Good experiences. The people always are willing to help me find what I want. They also give you a sample tester to take home of any product you want in store. They are able to do your makeup if you are a VIB and you get large samples if earn VIB points. The selection of brands is extensive and the Points program is free so why not!?!?!? From the app on your phone you can make your shopping list and see if they have the products in store before going. I used to only do Clinique and MAC, now I do a little bit of lip gloss or eye shadow from different brands. Still mostly those two but gives me options in one place depending on what looking for. Also has the clarisonic and devices like that in store! The big thing for me that it didn't get 5 stars is no MAC products and the VIB perks are good but not great.
5 This is my favorite Sephora in the city. Even as a local, I prefer the locations on the strip because I know they are going to have everything that I'm looking for without having to check their stock online. Everyone is helpful and attentive but not to the point where they are all over you. This Sephora although located inside Planet Hollywood, does not seem to get congested like the Venetian location. I do my research on the products and everything first and then when I have made a decision I visit the store for purchase. Here I can get in and out without having to wait long in line or travel a long way through the casino.
5 I came in here to get some foundation since I was out.  The Bare Escentuals loose mineral foundation is pretty awesome but I saw they had new pressed powder.  I asked one of the makeup girls to help me with finding the right color and she used this IQ computer thing to determine the right color.  When she put it on in the store, it looked great!  I got home and within a couple of days of using it, it was obviously too light for my skin.  I went back in and talked to them and they were so awesome.  Another girl did the IQ thing again and we went outside in the sunlight so she could apply three different brands.  We found the one that best matched my skin tone, and they traded the original one I had purchased, which I was grateful for.   Yeah it was a hassle to have to go back and exchange it, but they could've been complete jerks and refused a refund on an open and used product, without a receipt!  But they seemed more than happy to fix the mistake and never made me feel like they doubted my word on what happened.  I was very pleased with the customer service and I love my new foundation.
5 I just can't switch from Sephora brand makeup line!    This store is conveniently located in Town Square.  Always a great place to walk around, shop and eat!  This location is kept very clean and organized.  The selection of products is almost overwhelming!   But since I'm review for me,...  let me get to it.  My face has always been on the oily side.  I've tried just about every brand of cosmetics from Cover Girl to Clinique to help my 'oily' issue.  Sephora seems to be my skins favorite.  The foundation and powder gives great coverage with a light feel when I apply it.  Since I was almost out, I had to stop in for more!    Checking out I had a great lady help me.  Savannah was absolutely fantastic! I didn't have my Sephora beauty insider card with me.  There was no issue for her look up my account.  She did this quickly with ease!   She was very informative of my points and deals that were available.  It was a great shopping experience especially with her finishing touch!  Bonus~ I always get little goody samples in my bag.  Lets me try out different things for free all of the time!  Thanks Sephora!
2 I've never had any problem with their customer service.. Until recently. It feels as if it's getting worse and worse with each visit. Last night's experience was the worst.  I received an invitation for their VIB event, so I decided to stop by last night. Upon my arrival, I got no greetings at the door, no acknowledgement while I was browsing around, cashier looked like she didn't even want to be there, and lastly, no greetings leaving the store. I understand that it was during their busy hour, but the sales associates at the door seemed like they were too busy chatting with one another instead of acknowledging customers. (They didn't even smile at me!)  Walking into Sephora used to make me feel happy and joyful, but last night, I left the store feeling disappointed and offended.
2 Sorry and I hate to give Sephora this rating but my experience today left a lot to be desired.  I went to Sephora in search of quite a few items. I'm starting a new job so I wanted to update my makeup stash. I've been existing off of drug store brands for awhile now but my new job requires me to be not just presentable, but polished. So. I wanted to completely revamp my makeup collection. The funny thing is I came here ready to lay down some serious cash but....  There were PLENTY of employees working here but not one of them greeted me. I walked the aisles, mostly looking at Smashbox and NARS. I wanted a kit and kaboodle type purchase. IE: Concealer, foundation, powder, and a finisher. Unfortunately no employee came around to help me. I even had one girl walk by me, say nothing, and then greet another customer.  At that point I decided to just go with what I had seen on YouTube videos. I tested concealers/foundations on the back of my hand until I found a match. Then I wandered to the Clinique section and selected a mascara. I also decides on a new eye-liner by Urban Decay based off of a "review of eyeliners" I pulled up while in the store.  I spent a good hour here without ANY help from an employee AND I left with $90 worth of makeup.  Honestly I could have done this kind of shopping online since I did it all myself anyway. Unfortunately there's no way to compare skin tone and foundation online.  So - my thanks for this makeup rejuvenation mostly goes to makeup artists of YouTube 90% and 10% goes to Sephora for being the place I could go make my purchases.
5 Look I hope you bring a wad of cash with you to this store, hello. Mascara, lipstick, eyeliner oooohhhhhh! Get lost in the land of cosmetics! I do love Sephora, and the sales people here are really helpful and they make up-selling an art form. Come in your birthday month, if you are in the computer (or tell them to add you) you get a free Birthday month gift! I love that, great hook!  I go in for one thing and leave with 3 or 4... I do love the makeup forever base, and the Benefit Mascara is amazing...
5 The sales women were busy but made sure I got everything I needed. She was really helpful finding my correct shade and double checked to make sure she recommended the correct brands since I only buy cruelty free (not tested on animals). Great shopping experience.
4 Women constantly dream of looking hot and gorgeous, but Sephora is actually a place where you can learn to be! Sephora is a cosmetics store that sells semi-affordable makeup, with some of the most affordable being from Sephora's own line (which is pretty good btw).   I do not shop at any other makeup store. Sephora is my place for quality makeup and skincare. If you didn't know, spending a little bit more on your makeup will actually improve the quality of your skin, as long as you're taking care of it!!   The store is organized and clean. They have samples of almost everything and even give you something free at checkout for you to try. Don't forget to be a Beauty Insider!! :) That way you can use points to earn more makeup for being a loyal customer :D   One thing I do not like at this store is the customer service. At Town Square Sephora, no one really goes out of their way to help you. They just watch as you pick out products and don't really say a word.
5 I stopped by to pick up a couple of items and ended up sitting in a free makeup class on highlighting and contouring, which is all the rage now right? It lasted about an hour and a half, and they had a lovely classroom setup in the store with tables and seating, makeup and brushes for us to use. Peter was our instructor and it was obvious why he was the makeup director for all of Las Vegas. He was full of great information and definitely made highlighting and contouring a practical application and look for us instead of the super crazy drag queen look some girls take on. Dulce was assisting and she was wonderful as well. I took before and after photos and could definitely see a difference in my makeup application after trying Peter's techniques. I'm not one who listens very well to makeup lessons and prefer pros to do it for me, but I have definitely used Peter's techniques ever since this class.
5 who doesn't love Sephora? I have made the switch to using all Tarte products and Sephora is the only place in Vegas that supplies them. I have shopped here for years, and i absolutely love the employees here. They really are there to help!
1 I came in to get advice on anti aging products. The only employee that was helpful was the greeter. In the back there was three employees standing together and when I asked for help it was like dealing with some Heathers. I have good skin which I invest a lot of research and money in maintaining. When I mentioned I wanted to look up reviews on the only product one of then pointed out the employee took me to their touch screen and left me to my own devices.  If you want help getting skin advice go to ulta like I did.
5 Sephora is like heaven to a lady! All sorts of makeup, lots of different brands to choose from & test them in the store! They also have a great return policy on any products if your not satisfied with something. Definitely recommended the classes!! Did the Colorful Eyeshadow class & now I'm so confident in applying eyeshadow I can't wait to experiment more @ home. The staff was wonderful!!! Lauren, Monica & Yelena!! Thank you so much!!!! I will be looking for the next class!
4 Summer is coming up so I need all new make up because my tone goes red like crazy in the summer.  Got really good deal on everything.  My face doesn't feel as caked up like I tend to feel with my Mac. The name of the new line is Make up Forever. I wore it today to a Rodeo event today... I have oily skin but it made it even worst. Good thing is I can go back to Sophora and try another brand! By the way the employees are very helpful.
5 Every time I come in here I feel all warm and joyful inside.  This is my favorite business established EVER!
4 This is my favorite Sephora of all of the ones in Vegas. I was surprised to see the bad reviews but I understood why. Everyone that left a bad review hated that they weren't very attentive, I love that about this store. They let you browse, they will occasionally ask if you need help, if you don't they leave you alone. THANK YOU! for not being like the others where they follow you around like a lost puppy and then stand there with their arms behind their back and a creepy smile just staring at you waiting for you to ask them a question. Maybe I'm just an independent shopper but I love it. Leave me alone until I ask for help. Lol
