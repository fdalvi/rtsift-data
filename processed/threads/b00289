1 Well, I went there earlier tonight with my boyfriend. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and soft taco. He ordered the #6 combo, which is the beef chalupa w/a hardshell taco. The inside of my quesadilla was cold and barely had any chicken in it. I was very disappointed. My boyfriend's chalupas had barely any meat in the inside and it was the same for his hardshell taco. I would expect better service and better preparation. We waited an awfully long time about 15 minutes. I don't recommend this place to anyone. The Taco Bell on East Washington is far better.
3 Every once in a while, I get a craving for a Chulapa, and it's off to Taco Bell.  Love those things, and unlike some places, they've gotten my order right EVERY time!
5 I went to this location tonight and ordered food. The guy who took my order got the order wrong. I told the shift manager, Matt, and he fixed the problem immediately. Furthermore, he was polite and had good manners which was a plus. Thank you, Matt!
