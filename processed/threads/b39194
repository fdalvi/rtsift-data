3 We came here for breakfast on a Sunday morning. The diner was small with limited seating. The wait staff has to squeeze between chairs to wait tables. The food is country style and is delicious. They have a few unique dishes. After a short while, vintage cars began parking out front. This is a weekly breakfast group that drives these classics to the diner every Sunday. If you don't mind tight quarters, it's worth checking out.
4 Great neighborhood location.  Small, friendly, good food and service.  Not a spacious but adequate.  Many basic homemade specality items.  If you have the time to enjoy the visit  it is a great place to visit
5 Just love this place...breakfast was great! No frozen potatoes used! Great seasoning on our breakfast. Very nice owner and waitress. A definite return to!! You will enjoy breakfast or lunch here
