1 Horrible! Stopped in on 4-12-12, went through drive-thru after 11:50pm...ordered the #2. I thought I was gonna get fresh fries and burger...I ended up getting nasty fries, looked like it was made hours earlier and has been sitting out...GROSS!  The burger was sloppy made and had a fish taste. Don't stop there after 11-11:30pm. This is the last time I will ever eat at Wendys on 35th ave and Bethany hm rd. I tossed out the food and it was too late going back to ask for a whole new order. Should've just went over to Whataburger since they make it fresh instead of stale fries and burgers.
4 A good burger. You can taste the oldfashioned-ness.
2 I was there the other night, 20 minutes til close...they were out of mayo, ketchup, lettuce, tomato, iced tea and baked potatoes...what's left to order?  Just close early...
1 Horrible Horrible service. It was like we were bothering them. I don't understand. I work customer service everyday and I know how to treat customers,  not here. I will never go eat here again, and would never recommend this Wendy's to anyone. The management needs to seriously look at how people are being treated here. Then when the food finally came the order was all wrong,  I didn't even bother to let them know.
