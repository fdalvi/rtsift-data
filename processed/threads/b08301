5 Always get my water here. Very friendly people. They always offer to rinse out my containers.   They have great tasting water and sell water containers in multiple sizes.  The best deal is the water card, you get 50 gallons for $10, that's 20 cents a gallon.   If you eat sweets, I also reccomend the Rocky Road.
5 Who would ever expect to write a 5 star review about a Water and Ice store? I sure didn't but WOW, these people were fantastic! It was actually awkward to get such great service, didn't know how to handle it to be honest. These folks earned a customer for life tonight, offered to rinse my water containers, helped fill and load without me asking, best trip to get water ever!
5 All year long, I utilize their drive-up service to fill my water bottles, but in the summer this place becomes even more special because they make good shaved ice on the cheap (and offer so many flavors)! The owner collects solar dancers (just look up at the big window next time you're there), and all the workers are always friendly & attentive.
