4 Beautiful building, great counselors, great diversity of students and great school spirit!
5 I only went here because my niece and nephew are going here. Number one reason is because it is literally right next the gated community I live in. If you hop over the fence, you are at school already! The building itself is modern and has that new building smell still lingering. Based on what my niece and nephew tell me, they love going there! All the teachers and staff seemed very friendly to me.
3 my son transferring to this school this week from Centennial High school due to we bought a home in the beautiful gated community next to it.   We walked around the school recently to get the fill of the place.  Beautiful school.  Can't wait to meet the counselors and administration people when we register today.  I hope there's no problem with this school regarding gang activities within students like some other schools.  Hope from all the yelp comments I read that the school staff is really helpful to students and making their school safe against gangs, bullies, and negative students that creates bad experiences for good kids all together.
1 enrolled my 11th grade son here in November 2013, transfer from Centennial High, great disappointment from teachers to school enviroment overall.  I would like to rate it as "0" but couldn't.
