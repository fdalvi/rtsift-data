3 Its a dump! what more can you say, do we have any other options-really??? ....... wasn't to pricey but I don't know what dumps cost these days. stinks like a dump. This is the end of my review. Hope you get a chance to visit this place soon.
4 For being a DUMP, should expect much more.  Flys, stink, garbage, dirt, and everything that comes with.  Salt River... Keepin it real dumpy!
4 Salt River landfill is pretty nice as far as dumps go.  I have been going to landfills and green waste dumps for over 10 years . Their prices is about average and they are about average for time in and time out.    The only major negative things I can say is they have pretty high requirements to set up a commercial account and they only accept cash.
