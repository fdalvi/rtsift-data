2 I wandered in here because it's across the street from the Tufesa bus station, and I had a bunch of time to kill. This place looks like it was probably a fast food chain 30 years ago, and there were a couple of positive reviews from 15 years ago up on the wall. I wasn't sure what to expect, but sometimes you can find a great dive if you're adventurous. This wasn't one of those times.  I was there at breakfast time, and ordered huevos rancheros. It got corn tortillas with fried eggs on top, and some stewed vegetables on top of that. The other side of the plate was beans. The eggs were cooked well, but there must have been half a cup of vegetable liquid all over my plate. It ruined everything. I should have complained but I was too tired to bother.
2 Drive by this place every morning on my way to work. Never had a urge to eat here until recently. I knew what I was walking into just by looking at this place. Do not know how this place stays in business? Never see any business there! i ordered a breakfast burrito, it had eggs, sausage, and potatoes. Nothing special, something I could have made up at home. This is my opinion, when you have a restaurant. You should serve food that has something special. Not food, we can serve up at home. Give me a reason to return!! The location is very out dated, needs a new coat of paint and get rid of all the pictures. There are too many options in this area to eat at. This place really needs to change. But I doubt if they will!
3 This place is now called "Lorena's Cafe", so I'm assuming the food and other general information on the old listing is going to be incorrect; and as such, the older reviews are no longer relevant.  This place isn't the best Mexican food I've ever had, but it's certainly not the worst. It's authentic, cheap, fast and open at 6am, so you can't really beat that, especially considering that there aren't many places to eat in this area at that hour. I work next door, so I am here almost everyday, so it's definitely worth coming back to if it's convenient :)
