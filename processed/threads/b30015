5 I love this place. They always have theater groups that put on great shows, various performance artists and bands that you probably wouldnt see anywhere else, great local artists in the front gallery, and it's the home of Th Sic Sense sketch comedy troupe.
5 Poefest! This tiny, little, black box theater is host to my favorite Halloween tradition: Poefest. For about an hour you will enjoy dramatic monologues of Poe's writing. Sure, we all read these stories in school, but to hear them delivered in this fashion accentuates the beautiful poetry of his prose -- the natural rhythm he expertly creates by organizing his words -- and brings keen awareness to his mastery of language. Which is especially awesome because it's performed by players of Arizona Curriculum Theater (http://www.curriculumtheater.com/), a non-profit organization bringing classical literature, arts, history, sciences, and mathematics to life in classrooms and libraries across Phoenix, and driven by the mission to use the power of the arts to promote literacy, engage students, and make education more fun and accessible -- something they do very well!
5 Loved it so much I came back!  Spent a Saturday evening with my hubby at PoeFest and then returned the following weekend on Sunday with my mom.  Such a great location and looking forward to visiting again!
