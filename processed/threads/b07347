4 I have been awaiting lab results, post biopsy, for an entire month! This office has ignored the urgency of not only the biosy results , but they have not even bothered to call. I would NOT recommend this group of physicians to anyone.....as I continue to sit and wonder whether I have thyroid cancer!
5 Biopsy observations were sent to various locations and physicians. Upon reflection, I have confidence in this group of Doctors. They are ultra thorough, and do extensive research before reaching a diagnosis. I would especially recommend Dr. Daniel Duick!
5 Having spent much of the last year shuttling back and forth between doctor's office, I always appreciate going to a practice that is well run and well staffed.  That is definitely the case at Endocrinology Associates.    I met with the doctor, had a thyroid ultrasound and bloodwork done within an hour (they have an on-site lab which is super convenient).  Dr. Harari called me personally less than 48 hours later with my bloodwork results.    Definitely recommend!
