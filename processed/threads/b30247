5 Alexandra was amazing!  My appointment for a cut and style began right on-time, and she took the time to get to know me, and what I was looking for.  She was conservative in the length, and progressed only if she got my okay to go shorter.  After she blow dried my hair (which takes forever for my hair to dry, no matter how nice of a blow dryer you have!), and styled, she looked at it again, and made a few more suggestions that better framed my face, and got my hair to lay better. If I weren't moving away from the area, I would definitely visit her again!  Booking an appointment was a snap!  Just visit the website, and book online.  FYI the Salon Suite Fifteen is located inside what looks kind of like a small office building, which is filled with a lot of different salons.  I was very happy to support a local small business!  Here's directions from Alexandra's website: Suite Fifteen is located inside of Vintage Salon. When you walk in the door turn left down the hall and then right at the second hallway (you will see the salon on your right through the window).  I also submitted an update to the address, which is not correct on Yelp.  It should be located at Higley and Ray.  Check the website for correct location.
5 After a string of bad hair cuts I came across Alexandra on yelp and made an appointment.  I really like the online booking system, very easy and convenient.  Alexandra did a great job cutting my hair, she takes time to get it just right.  I would highly recommend her to anyone....
5 Alexandra is awesome!  Very personable and caring.  Bonus is that she is quick with color, which is a huge bonus for me with tons of hair!
