3 I can Never find what I'm looking for but always know they'll take anything I drop off! Donations beat any dump fees.
2 This particular Goodwill store is always a mess.  Rarely can I find what I'm looking for, with decent quality, but I have found a few things worth while.  If I have the chance to go to a Goodwill farther away I will, even though this is the closest to me.
2 This has to be the most unorganized, cluttered, dump-your-crap here, Goodwill in the East Valley!  It's their 50% off day and they have 1 register open!  I was there from 2-4 looking around, and only once did they have 2 registers open but after ringing up a few customers the cashier announced it was her lunch break and left, with no replacement!  It's hot, cramped, and cluttered.  There is no rhyme or reason to their racks and most of their stuff is broken or dirty.  Don't waste your time or money, find another Goodwill to shop at.
