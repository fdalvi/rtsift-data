2 Regis at University Square used to be my backup salon, but since it was torn down and my usual salon was booked up, I decided to try the Regis Salon at West Towne.    The salon was clean, the staff was polite and relatively speedy.  The stylist I had was very friendly and asked lots of questions, which was great and I thought I was happy with the cut until I got home and really got a chance to take a look at it.  She styled it very nicely, but I guess she just assumed that I would always want to style it exactly the same way, because as soon as I moved a hair it was a disaster area.    I asked for a layered collar-bone length cut with a bit of texture and long side bangs.  I ended up with bangs that were two inches longer on the right side of my face, hair an inch longer on the right side, completely blunt ends that were at least two inches below my collar bone.  I look like I had my hair cut by a one-eyed high schooler.  If I wasn't leaving town tomorrow I would go back in and demand they fix it.   Only giving two points because of the clean and friendly atmosphere and that one stylist put on Muse for awhile.    I'm sorry I didn't wait and go to Studio 924.
2 I've booked colors and cuts with Rina several times and she does an excellent job.  She understands modern coloring and cutting techniques and always makes sure we're on the same page before starting a process. ***Karina has left Regis along with many other talented stylists so I'm revising my rating.
5 Always get a great cut and style
