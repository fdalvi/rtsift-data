5 This place is consistently rated one of the top two or three salons in the state, which is probably what drew my sister and mom there to begin with. Being a totally oblivious male when it comes to things like this, I usually just go with recommendations from friends or family. What was surprising was that it has all the chic trendiness of the upscale places, which ding patrons for 60-75$ per male cut, but at less than half the price.   I have gotten cuts from Myriah, Rae Lyn, and Lucy and they all have done great jobs. They all were able to take what I instructed (for example, once it was, "I'm shooting for Dr. McDreamy. Go!") and I'm always pleasantly surprised. Good conversation, nice people, and no snobby feel like at most spots like it.
5 I'm with you Jake!  I've been seeing Keiko at SS for 7 years or so.  She does a fabulous cut and she's a master at perfect color.  (Not that I'd know, YES, I'm a natural blonde...just not this blonde!)  It's not an intimidating, snotty salon.  Everyone's really nice and friendly.  They always have snacks and tea or coffee for the clients.  Great spa services from facial and manicures to full massages and waxing too.  Try Keiko and tell her Gayle sent you!  She's the bomb!
5 The exhaustive search is finally over!  I finally found a hair stylist who knows what he's doing, is friendly, takes his time, gives great conversation and a neck massage and is easy on the eyes.  I didn't even have to go home and fix anything after Bobby cut my hair, which is usually not the case.  I was so impressed that I set my next appointment before I left.  *** 5th HAIRCUT UPDATE *** After my 5th haircut with Bobby, I can not complain about a thing.  I don't even have to tell him how to cut my hair anymore.  He remembers what I want and how I like it.  He's so personable that he makes getting my hair cut an event rather than an appointment.      ******** November 08' UPDATE********** OK fellow Yelpers, you're really starting to ruffle my feathers!  I shouldn't have said such nice things about Bobby because now YOU people are making it difficult for ME to get an appointment (or as I like to call it, a date) with Bobby.  From now on, I'm going to start giving aliases for people who are in my reviews.    So forget all the things I said about that Bobby guy, that was an alias that I made up.  Really, the person who cut my hair was Frank or Fred or Fritz, I highly recommend him.  He's great if you can get past the multiple personality disorder.
5 I was in Phoenix for a conference, was in desparate need of a haircut, and had some spare time to kill. Thanks to Yelp, I found Salon Surreal and Tasia (my stylist)!! She did a GREAT job, I cannot get over how great my hair looks. I even trusted her enough to cut bangs for the first time in like 12 years. Good chair conversation and awesome skills.
5 Thanks to Yelp. I am going to have to concur wholeheartedly with Bobby Q. I just left Salon Surreal and was so impressed by Bobby (the stylist) and the salon itself. Bobby did an amazing job on my hair and yes does a great neck massage and is super personable. The salon has a really great atmosphere. Is super friendly and in no way pretentious.   If the Indian restaurant next door is any good, I may have just found my once every 6 week happy place.  But again, thanks to yelp and all of you, I wouldn't have known about or tried this place if it weren't for reading all the great reviews on here!
1 I am really surprised that Salon Surreal has received such positive reviews. I mean, *really* surprised. I went (on these Yelp recommendations) and immediately wanted to call Tabitha for a salon takeover.   I went in for a manicure/pedicure and was able to get in the same day. Parking was a bit of a struggle on a weekday afternoon but not too bad. When I walked in I was greeted by a full wall of products. That's all you see. Just this huge wall of products.   I think Huey Lewis and the News was on the sound system, too.   I went to check in and there were lots of young girls--none of them with fabulous haircuts--standing around the front desk. They checked me in and I waited for my nail tech, who showed up and gave me the weakest handshake ever. I almost laughed and could barely hear her. She was perfectly nice and polite, but it was just awkward.   She took me back and gave me a class of water, which was nice, and then started on my hands. I didn't have much to say to her (and couldn't hear her over the N'Sync song on the stereo) so I just looked around as she clipped my cuticles. The place is a cluttered mess. I couldn't believe it. There's just stuff everywhere. Photos, pieces of paper, knick-knacks, stacks of towels, old chairs and nail accessories. Clutter clutter clutter. And on top of the clutter was lots of dust. It was gross.   The decor is this weird early 90s red/black/contemporary thing going on. Oh and did I mention the music? Yeah. I admit that bad music stresses me out--I'm just that kind of person--but this was so bad that if I heard it at a bar or a coffee shop I'd turn around and walk out. And it wasn't even "dentist's office" bad. It was worse than what you'd hear at Applebee's.   My pedicure was better because I could just sit there and let her do her thing and bury my head in a magazine. There were a lot of staff standing around still, too. One had a laptop open.  I suppose the most non-relaxing thing I experienced was the smells. This salon uses Creative nails and the lotions and accessories all reek of fake fruits and flowers. It was nauseating.   When I left I went back to use the restroom and passed by the huge washing room and several dozen lockers where I suppose the staff keeps their stuff? It all just screamed "factory" to me. The bathroom, too, was this weird mish-mosh of contemporary (not modern) and Tuscan.   There is nothing soothing about this salon. And as a new client I was shocked they didn't offer me a discount. Instead, I paid $90 after tip for my mani/pedi. And sure enough, my cuticles were ragged and unfinished and after a week my toenail polish is chipping.   On Newbury Street in Boston I paid $45 for a pedicure that lasted me 3 weeks. If you like the kind of salon that's calm, relaxing, serene, and upscale, this is not your place. If you like fun and action and don't care so much if you have to go back every week because everyone there is so much fun, then this is your place. Personally, I like calm and quiet and quality.
4 Based on all of the positive reviews I read here on Yelp, I wanted to give Salon Surreal a try. I'm glad I did because I had a positive experience and I will be back.  I called in to try and make an appointment with Bobby because he had the most positive reviews. Unfortunately, we had conflicting schedules for three weeks straight and I couldn't wait that long. I decided to go with Brandy because the receptionist said she was good with bangs.   The salon itself is pretty cool and really big. There are a ton of stylists and it looks like it caters to medium to upscale clients, but like other people mentioned before, it was very comfortable and unpretentious.  They have separate areas for cuts, dryers and the sinks, so I got the opportunity to see the entire salon. I was pretty impressed. They have flexible hours, which is great because I work until 4pm, and a huge variety of products.  My color came out great and even though this is a new salon, the color matched perfectly with my old salon and my cut came out great. Brandy actually did a better job than my old stylist who I had been seeing for almost two years! She was extremely friendly and had great chair talk. She gave me exactly what I asked for and I was comfortable the entire time.  I would definitely recommend this salon  :) I would say it is a TAD overpriced but its not awful, and they fully disclose the prices on the website, on a product card and before your service, so you are well aware.
4 ETA: Bobby has moved to Moments Salon off Camelback. I'm still seeing him all these years later, and adore the cuts he gives. Love, love him. :)    I like to give a cut a few days before I pass full judgment...  AND  I AM IN LOVE WITH MY HAIR!!!!!!!!!   I was needing and wanting a change from my other stylist who'd just look at  me and want me to tell her what to do. Um, isn't *she* the professional? I digress...  Anyway, I turned to my Yelpers, and you did good by me. I went to Bobby and am very, very, very happy with my hair. In fact, now several people want his card and to go see him.  He was the perfect combination of listening to what I want and am willing to do with my hair and making suggestions of what will best suit me.  Well, Yelpers... I've now got a cut that is LITERALLY wash and go. OMG. A girl could not be more pleased! He spent time talking me through how to get my curls to look good (not frizzy and uggh lookin'). He was very easy to talk to and there were no weird, uncomfortable silences, kwim?  I concur with the neck and scalp massage. Ahhhhhhh...  One thing that really irritates me about some other salons is when they say nasty things about how your hair was cut last time and/or when they make you feel like you are an ugly piece of crap without them. We've all heard it before. "Wow, they really cut this uneven last time..blah, blah, blah" Nothing could be further from the reality with Bobby. He was a delight and was very professional.  Boy, I'm glad I booked my next appointment with him NOW. I think he's going to get even more busy with all of these Yelpers lovin' him.   The man does some good work. I love this hair. In fact, I think this is the first time in the 30-some odd years I've been dealing with this head-o-hair that I truly love and appreciate the fact that I have natural curls. I'll have to upload a new pix with them later. He did a great blow out job on the hair, too.  Thanks, Yelpers! I'm a happy, happy girl!  **Disclaimer: I give Bobby -- himself -- 5 stars all the way!! The salon itself was good
5 I've been going to Salon Surreal for about a year now. I get my waxes done there, and am totally in love with Kari!!! Those back rooms are great, and relaxing. I've gotten a facials and micro-dermabrasions done as well, all of it well worth the time and money I spent!   I also have my hair done now by Nichole, who is new to the salon, but  super sweet!! She's actually going to be doing my hair and the bride's hair for my brother's up coming wedding! And from what I've heard of her other formal 'do's she's amazing, so I'm very excited about that.   No matter what you're looking for this salon and spa has what you need! And if you're not sure, give them a call and the receptionists can give you a recommendation!   I love the decor of the place, it's appealing to the eye (if you know what to look for) and it's classy. I would say it's the best mixture of an upscale salon and a place I could go just to hang out.   Everyone that works there is nice and their personalities run the spectrum!! Some are sweet and soft spoken while others are boisterous and outgoing. The one thing I would never say is that this salon is anything like a factory. It's functionality and flowing set up allows clients to be the center of their stylists, esthetician, or nail techs attention. Each person there brings their own personality and pop! to their area but is by no means cluttered.   I would recommend this salon to anyone visiting the Phoenix area!! They have fabulous male and female stylists, massage therapists, estheticians, and nail techs!!!!
2 I really wanted to like this salon. After the reviews I read, I was expecting a really upscale salon. While the iced tea served there is good, I diddnt think they would bring it to me in a tiny styrofoam cup. I used to go to Rolfs. But wanted a change. I explained this to the receptionist that I am in bad need of a new look. I tried to book my appointment with Bobby, but he was on vacation. So I asked who was good with coloring brunette hair and she told me Rachel. I arrived early because after reading reviews I thought parking would be a nightmare. I had no problem parking and there were many spots available. Rachel was a doll. She had an awesome personality. And after I told her I really wanted a change, there wasnt much hair cut off at all. The color was beautiful when I left the salon, but the red washed out within 3 days. I was very dissapointed. Also I saw other stylists giving the neck massages forever! However, I diddnt get any such treatment. The only time I got in the sink was to quickly wash the color out. I do not love the cut. When I spend that much money on a salon visit. I think I should LOVE it. I will not be returning to the salon. But for those of you who wish to, there is a 20 percent off coupon on arizonaspagirls.com
4 I went back for a bang trim because it was really an emergency. I got a same day appt. for 5pm with my regular. I was excited when I walked in because she was waiting for me (I was 15 mins early) and she remembered who I was, which is great customer service.  As usual, Brandy was very friendly and we discussed plans for the weekend. I also made mention that my hair was NOT black as I wanted, and she told me to just tell the receptionist next time I book a color appt. that I need black and they will special order. ALRIGHT!  From the time I left my car to the time I got back in, was a total of 9 minutes.. which was pretty cool. And the trim was free. Cant beat that.
5 I get my hair cut at Salon Surreal.  I've been going for a while now and I love it.  Each time I go, Lauren, who's at the front desk knows me by name and makes me feel welcome.  Bobby cuts my hair and does a great job each time!  He always makes sure that I like when he's done and gives the greatest washes ever!  he also styles it when I leave.  :-)  The salon is clean and bright and full of color. There are usually cookies and beverages available too.  Aside from hair, Salon Surreal also offers nail services, massages, and waxing.  Salon Surreal is great because it's casual and offers great services at decent prices.  Go and treat yourself!  Also, walk ins are welcome.
5 Since my first appointment with Brandi three years ago, I won't let anyone else near my hair.  Best highlights ever, and great cuts from short to long and back again.  I have recurring goth phases too, so I appreciate that she doesn't condemn me for being a child of the 80s.  ;o)  The place is friendly and hip and pretty competitive in their pricing, considering that it gets such rave reviews.  I can't help but notice the lack of haughtiness.  This is a milder version of swank.  Everyone's really friendly (they even feed me tea & cookies), and when I was finally brave enough to treat my hopelessly imperfect body to that first bikini wax, I was really glad I did it here.  Highly recommended!
5 I was in desperate need for a haircut and I needed to get in a salon right away. I called salon surreal to ask how much a haircut costs there and when they told me $50 I thought that was really expensive but they were able to fit me in right away so i made an appointment. I usually pay about $30 including tip so I was wondering why they charge so much for haircuts.  My appointment was with Tasia and she was awesome. She asked me what kind of cut I wanted and I told her to do whatever she thinks will look good on me. Next step was washing my hair and she gave me a great head massage it was so relaxing I wanted to take a nap. Tasia did a great job with the cut and style and gave me tips on different ways to style my hair. She also showed me some products that I should use but wasn't pushy about selling them to me.  I really enjoyed getting my hair cut at Salon Surreal and now I understand why they charge $50 for a haircut. The stylists that work there are experienced and know their stuff.
5 I'm not a salon type of girl.  In fact, I hate getting my hair done. Having to sit there for two hours (I have a lot of hair), participating in the inane banter with my stylist who is annoyingly way cooler than me. One might say I had serious commitment issues when it came to stylists. I would stick with them for a couple months then leave them for someone new.  My search has ended! I can't find enough good things to say about Bobby. He's funny and personable, he always gives his suggestions  and he never scolds me when I let my hair grow out for WAY too long a time.  Though SS is about two minutes from where I live I would still give it my business regardless, it's friendly and unpretentious and Bobby's the best!
3 Although their prices for color/cuts are very reasonable and my stylist did a fairly good job, I was overall less than impressed with Salon Surreal.  - I received a phone call 10 minutes before my appointment time that my stylist was running more than 30 minutes late. I had already driven across town in traffic and had nothing to do, so I had to sit and wait in their lobby. - I barely received an apology from the front desk staff when I arrived.  - The stylist later told me the reason she was running late was because the client before me arrived late. I am a fair person, but I cannot consider this a reasonable excuse to be running more than 30 minutes late. - The stylist took longer than I expected to finish my hair, so that combined with her running late resulted in me a missing another appointment later that evening.  Again, I have to stress that the work was fine and the price was right, but my first impression of the salon was ultimately not a good one. I will continue to look elsewhere for the perfect salon!  EDIT: Since posting this review I have received not 1 but 2 letters from my stylist asking me how my hair turned out. She also included special offers if I returned for another appointment. I appreciate the follow up. On the flip side, as my hair has grown out I have noticed that this cut, although better than the one I had when I walked into Salon Surreal, is not great. Even with the discounts, I will need to look elsewhere.
5 I'm probably the last person who gives a shit about his haircut but every couple of months it starts to get too hot and I need to get it cut.  Since my "lil sis" Francesca works here, I always go to her.  She does a great job and gets me in and out in in 15-20 minutes.    The place is always clean, it smells good, and is well lit.  It is really a nice looking salon.  The chairs aren't so close together that you can watch the person next to you.  I really like that aspect.  Francesca is great & is way fun to hang out with.  All the other people in there are all douchey.  Anyways, if you want some good lookin hair, go see French over here and she'll hook you up.
5 My experience:   My sister-in-law, Kari Gibney works at Salon Surreal as an aesthetician (or however you spell it! - She does great facials, waxing, etc.).    I am starting a new job tomorrow and woke up and decided I desperately needed a new hair-do!!  So, I thought I'd try out her place....even though I  was tempted to try out the nearby Supercuts because I am broke.    But, I came to my senses and thought I better not take that chance and go ahead and get a good cut.  So, after reading all the previous reviews and talking with Kari I was so excited to get in (the same day I called) to see the proclaimed Bobby - apparently a hair guru.    I have to say, it was the best cut I've had in a long time.  I had been going to another salon and paying $40 for the haircut.  It was always just okay.  Bobby's haircut was $45 and SO WORTH that extra $5!!!  He was completely friendly and easy-going.  He gives the best scalp and neck massage too!!!  My previous stylist never did that!!!  The salon is open and everyone seems very friendly - plus they have ice water, iced tea (in actual glasses instead of styrofoam cups) and cookies.... which my old salon never had/offered.     My hair is thin and frustrating to work with because it's also frizzy/kinky/curly.  But, he gave me a new cut (I've always done some version of a bob) that is so cute!!! I love it!!!  And he could blow-dry it so it was smooth looking (without a flat-iron)!  So, I think I'll stick with Bobby from now on! And if you need a good aesthetician ask for Kari Gibney!!!  P.S. I do want to point out - as an overall salon it's not the best out there in terms of design/decor/atmosphere - the decor is kind of outdated and it's not as serene as I think salons should be.  But, I gave the place 5-stars because for the moderate price range it's pretty darn good.  I'd challenge you to find a more opulent salon for the same prices.  I'm sure there are some amazingly designed salons out there that are opulent, modern, luxurious, etc - but their haircuts are not gonna be $45!  Just wanted to make that point.
1 I've always felt like the superficiality of this place makes me feel unwanted, the only reason I go is because of my fantastic stylist, who has since moved to another salon. With that said, I'm glad I don't have to shlep down the 51 to a salon full of self-absorbed people.
5 So I am pretty new to Phoenix, AZ and have had the most horrible time trying to find a decent hair dresser... I was pretty skeptical in trying out a new person, I mean how hard is it to cut an A-line and color a persons hair chocolate brown?  I decided to do some true research and of course used yelp to find Salon Surreal and booked an appointment with Julie.  Their prices are very reasonable cut, color, and style for 100 bucks.  Julie is amazing young and gets the concept of good hair.  Im a talker and for not knowing me at all she really made me feel conformable and I am definitely going back!
5 I actually took cosmotology in high school.  I know the basics but obviously can't do much to my own hair other than dye it.  I know the "shoulds" and "should nots".  I like the atmosphere and the layout of the salon.  Ask for Ann Delisanti, she rocks
5 I'm a commitaphob when it comes to salons. I don't know why, but it's hard to find a hair dresser and location I love enough to commit to and work with the scheduling etc. That is, until I walked into a one Salon Surreal and two years later, I'm still going back!  For my hair, I go to Heidi Hand. She is the funniest and greatest hair dresser there is. She makes you laugh and your hair look great and you really just want her to go get a drink with you when you're done so the conversation can continue.   For my eyebrows, I go to Jessica. Now for those of you who were blessed with eyebrows (or any other part) that needs the glorious experience known as waxing, you know it can be a royal pain. Plus, if you get someone who doesn't understand what you're looking for in an eyebrow shape, you are S.O.L. for weeks. But, Jessica has it down. I almost forget about the pain and my eyebrows look awesome after.   The salon is conveniently located next to a great Mexican food restaurant so if you need a cocktail and snack before or after, you don't have to go far.   I tell everyone about Salon Surreal. I'm talking strangers walking down the street. It's just that amazing!!
5 Although I have yet to have my hair cut at this salon, I come here just about every 6 weeks to have hair painfully ripped off of my face.  I have tried a lot of different salons around town, and Jessica is by far the loveliest and most friendly aesthetician I have ever had! She nearly makes the waxing experience pleasant :)  Definitely a place I'll be staying loyal to!
5 Once again Salon Surreal and Heidi Hand comes to the rescue!! I've been so overdue for a hair cut... it's really embarrassing how overdue actually.  Last week I called my favorite girl Heidi to see if she could squeeze me in. Now, every time I go in she urges me to make a followup appointment then and there because she books up so fast, but there are times that I guess I don't list. Hand slap for me; I know. Heidi's so popular because everyone knows how fun and awesome she is, so when I called for an appointment, I knew it was going to be a long shot. Just as I feared, the appointment gal told me that Heidi's next available appointment was in October...October! My split ends screamed and shivered when they heard that. So I asked her to put me on the waiting list and prayed to the hair dresser fairies for a miracle. And guess what?? True to the awesomeness of Salon Surreal and especially Heidi, I got a call a day later informing me of a cancellation for Saturday AM. So, today, I woke up bright and early and had another fabulous hair cut, chatted up a storm with the stellar Heidi and left split-end free. Oh and this time, I made a followup appointment!
5 I know ... I know... your thinking - this chic lives in Seattle, Wa; why is she reviewing THIS salon? Well let me get my soapbox out from underneath my bed- make sure my mic is on. Haacchummmm...   I have been looking high and low for someone to give me a decent - I was just hoping for decent haircut and color. I have that kind of curly hair that everyone who doesn't have LOVES and everyone who has hates (you know the kind). Jessica Lawson is the only professional that I would ever let touch my hair again. Which in some ways really sucks cause I have to wait for my biyearly business trip to PHX. But she is worth the wait - and weight in gold.   She gives realistic advice about your hair; sets realistic expectations and delivers above and beyond service and professionalism.   I am happy and honored to have found someone who I trust.   Thank you Jessica.
5 Brandi did wonders for my abused and neglected hair!! I hadn't had my hair so much as trimmed in nearly a year! 3 inches removed, and I am loving it!! Thank you, Brandi!! :)
4 I had been planning for weeks to schedule an appt to get my hair done before my Seattle trip (in two days). But in typical Tina fashion, I realize this past Sunday I need to get my ish in gear and schedule an appt! Slacker, I know. I called a few places yesterday and I was lucky to get an appt at Salon Surreal for today. I showed up about 45 minutes early (got off work early) and had to make do since they couldn't get me in earlier. They offered me something to drink, since I decided to wait, and I was happy to see several piles of my favorite intellectual reads: Glamour and a variety of gossip mags. Hey, sometimes a girl needs mind fluff after a hard day at work! The layout of the salon was a little odd. The lobby chairs all faced the hair products and the partition really seemed to close off the salon. During my wait, I noticed that the staff was really friendly and seemed very efficient. The girl who did my hair, Francesca, grabbed me five minutes before my appt. I thought she did a really nice job on my hair and was really friendly. The total (excl. tip) was $115 for a cut, style, and hair coloring. I wouldn't do this every month, but it seemed pretty reasonable given my curly, thick hair. I had her straighten my hair and it  looks pretty damn great. Just in time for my trip to Seattle....
5 I am devoted to Hiedi Hand (a.k.a. Hot Hiedi). She's been cutting my hair for several months, ever since my previous stylist moved to D.C. She's so hilarious and outgoing--she tells it like it is. Plus she does a great job on the cut and is always sure I like it. If I'm iffy about the bangs, she'll redo them. She doesn't push me to buy the styling products at the salon. In short, love Hiedi.
5 I have been going to this salon for my haircuts for almost a decade.....holy sh*t I am getting old!  I see Ann Gentle and I would not even know how tell someone how to cut my hair now that I have been seeing her so long.  The place is really nice and it has a cool atmosphere, I love the location in central Phoenix even though I have now moved to the NW Valley.  I still take the drive to come and see her since I now know her so well.  The other staff is always really nice and if you are a guy, I have to tell you that the scenery is great!  I cant complain about having tons of hot girls around while I get my hair cut.
4 Consider this a real salon.  A place that you would wear makeup and decent clothes to.  I showed up in my most unflattering work outfit and I was feeling a little more than uncomfortable.     Thankfully, my stylist Mandy didn't prejudge me and was willing to take her time discussing my new cut and highlights.  She had lots of good ideas and I ended up with really good cut and some new blonde highlights.  I'd definitely go back to her.
5 I moved here almost 4 years ago and after a handful of bad cuts (picture the girl in 16 candles who got her hair caught in the door and a couple of other girls cut it out) a friend referred me to Salon Surreal. I've been going there for almost 2 years now. The first lady that did my hair moved and referred my to Stephanie Franklin and I couldn't be happier. It's nice to have found someone that understands my hair type (curly) and knows how to cut it.
5 If you want professional work from an expert esthetician, make an appointment with Ginger Lee. She's thorough and discreet. She provides an array of services including full body waxing. As waxing goes, it's somehow far less painful with Ginger. She has a way of distracting you in at the most strategic moments! LOL
5 I was looking for a local place to continue my new obsession with gel nails.  A positive review on another site led me to Jillian Vaughan within Salon Surreal Salon & Day Spa.  We went with a dark navy Shellac and gel overlay.  Spring pastel colors be damned-my nails looked neat and super shiny!  She was super quick and the nails had a nice density.  They have grown out well and have not chipped.  Thanks Jillian!
5 Not that I'm a germaphobe,but a significantly negative experience with a simple manicure many years back has me handling all my mani/pedi needs myself. Every now and again(like once a year)I'll get my toenails professionally done,then I simply keep up on my own. I perused here and Kudzu for a nail salon and after looking at some with high revues,I just wasn't at all comfortable utilizing the services of places where I can't effectively communicate with staff due to the prevalent language barrier that is the norm for the nail salon industry. So,after a few look sees,I took a chance and booked an appointment with Salon Surreal. When I got there,I saw the wall of product and the bustling front desk. Even though there were a few others checking in,I was greeted immediatley and warmly. I was about 10 minutes early.In looking around I couldn't help noticing how loud the cutting floor seemed to be,even though shielded by the wall of product.You could see so many people buzzing around,it looked like a beehive to me.I didn't think "spa". To me,a spa is quiet and serene.This place was anything but that! So,about 5 minutes before my appointment time,Janea greets me and brings be back to the nail area. She's already got the station set up,nice hot(but not too hot)foot bath already set.Nice detail. I'm the only client back there so it's a very welcome difference from the cacophany of the front. Janea is very soft spoken and has a very light touch,which was perfect for me.She is also a consumate professional at what she does.The massage was a light touch as well,but very effective and soothing. I'm now going on week three and the pedicure still looks fresh with no chipping or dulling of the polish. I thought the price was a bit high for a basic pedicure,but with the first time discount here mentioned and honored,it brought the price point down to something more palatable. Since the pricing is a bit on the high side,I have to say,it will keep me away from more frequent visits. If I come across a coupon or another dicount offer,I will be back. For those of you wanting a very nice pedi experience,I do highly recomment Janea.
4 Ann Gentle is excellent!  I just moved to Phoenix and was looking for someone to cut my hair and Yelp helped me out.  She listens, is creative and just genuinely a good person to be around!
5 Hiedi is my stylist of choice at Salon Surreal. I've been a client for a LONG time ... let's see... 7 years. That's a long time in the hair salon years!  What keeps me coming back are the compliments I frequently get on my hair color. People are always asking me what I've done different. I really have no idea what exactly changes from one visit to the next. But I trust Hiedi every time. She puts me at ease and always knows how to change the color slightly to keep up with the season or my mood. She's fun to chat with, does her best to stay on schedule and always have great assistants to keep things moving.
5 This is my salon.  I've been going to Tammy Brunelle for ten years since I was in high school.  She always gives me a great haircut and color job.  I highly recommend scheduling an appointment with her asap!
5 I have been going to Salon Surreal for almost 10 years.  Ann Dellisanti is the best of the best.  I am not always the easiest client to work with, I change it up all the time, and she never loses patience with me. She always wants to make sure I am happy.  I have recommended many friends to her over they years and they always go back too.
5 I have been getting my haircut here for 6 years and cannot imagine going anywhere else!  We moved an hour away 4 years ago and I have continued to go back to Ann Gentle for the quality cut and the incredible service.
4 Great salon- Keiko is my favorite and I know I'm not the only one who thinks so! She is so precise; I always know I will get a good cut from her plus she is so fun to talk to.  I love that they use Bumble and Bumble products from wash to cut to style. I always leave Salon Surreal and Keiko feeling fresh and amazing!
5 A great unpretentious but very nice salon with good people who care about what they do.  It shows.  I go to Todd Miller.  He is a great guy and a better stylist.  SO silly that the owners picture is the photo for this place.  Sends a bad vibe that this place does NOT have.  I've been going here for years and have never met her.  Most stylists are busy/booked, but they do accept walk-ins most of the time.  Might want to call ahead though.    Ann Gentle and Heidi H. are also great.
5 While my regular gal was out on maternity leave, I decided to go see Ann Gentle to keep my hair fantastic.  I used to go to this salon many years ago and was happy to be back.  Many of the girls there said hello and that they missed seeing me coming in.  It was nice to feel so welcome. Ann has never done my hair before and thought I might bring in a picture.  My bad, I didn't.  I did as best I could to explain what I wanted to her.  She asked great questions about how natural or dramatic I wanted my coloring to be.  She ended up doing a great job and my hair turned out better than I what I had hoped for.  My highlights were weaved tight and my hair looked very natural as I requested.   I highly recommend Ann Gentle if you want your hair to have great color!
4 they did a fantastic job on my bodywave. I love it-still looking great months later.
4 I have been to this salon twice and had two different stylists. First time I had Jeff and he was awesome but no longer works there. The second time I went I met with Nicole for a hair cut and style. Both experiences were pleasant. The salon has great hours and is very accomodating. I do think it's a bit pricey for what you get but I will go back. $50 for a 30 min haircut and style plus I tip $10.
5 I used to frequent Salon Surreal to do my hair before I moved to California. If you need to get your base color and/or highlights done, the one person you must absolutely request for an appointment is Shari Davis. She is truly a genius with color and someone with her techncial capability cannot simply be found anywhere else.   After moving to California, I've been to multiple salons to try to find someone who can color my hair and "get the red out" but alas, I have stumbled on some failures. I have since dyed my hair a dark brown because frankly, there is no Shari Davis that I can find and I've given up. If I could afford to fly to Phoenix to get my hair done by Shari at Salon Surreal, I would in a heartbeat.
5 One word: SHARI. She is amazing. She has been my go-to girl for the past four years. She not only makes it easy to have a conversation, but she is brilliant at hair color. I have never left there unsatisfied. It took me awhile to find the perfect stylist, and trust me, you will not be disappointed. I have referred two friends to her, and they are attached as well!  She also specializes in blonde, so if you are a blonde, you know how difficult it is to find someone who is great at bleach! She is fantastic, and really listens to what you have to say, as well as offering great advice! Kari is amazing at eyebrow waxing too! I LOVE SALON SURREAL!
5 I started going to this salon a couple months ago when my hair dresser had moved to New Jersey. I was scheduled with Megan, and couldn't have had a better experience. She was wonderful and friendly and made my hair look awesome!   I was there again this morning and had another great experience with Megan. My hair cut and style was reasonably priced and they don't stress you out with pushing products on you (unless of course you ask for recommendations).  I will def keep going back :)  Update: I've been going here for over a year now, and STILL use Megan, and she's STILL fantastic. Definitely recommend using her, although I hear many of the stylists are great (I'm just biased now).
4 I decided to book an appt here after reading all these great reviews on yelp!  I saw that a lot of salons are closed on Sundays so it's definitely a plus that they are open.  They had an opening with Laura so off I went!  I was definitely pleasantly surprised.  The staff was friendly and Laura did a great job asking questions.  I'm one of those "do whatever you want" type of people BUT I have a lot of hair and it's a weird Asian wavy.  You can't really cut it too short or it puffs out and I am super lazy and rarely style.  Yes, I know... I expect to wake up look great and go.  The cut- All I kept thinking was "omg, she's cutting too much off.. Omg more layering... Omg more razoring.. Omg this is going to be a disaster."    Thank goodness it wasn't!  Like I said, I was very pleasantly surprised!  I had wanted something a little different and she succeeded with flying colors.  Loving it!
4 I have a terrible time finding a good salon to go to primarily because I don't really like going and having my hair done.  The whole experience can take forever and be somewhat unpleasant depending on where you go.  I was pleasantly surprised however after visiting Salon Surreal and actually liking the experience.  I called, they had an opening, and voila before I knew it the whole thing was done.  Painless, professional and comfortable.  Everyone was super friendly and unpretentious.  I will be coming back.
4 Firstly, I'm a dude.  Secondly, this was my first "salon" experience.  My longtime barber left V's, the quintessential place where MEN get their hair done.  It took me a long time to actually find that barber and it's not worth the growing pains to test out the rest of them.  I told my wife this and she said to try her salon.    With hesitation, I went.  It's overwhelmingly targeted towards women, but once I got over that I got a FANTASTIC haircut.  The stylist was genuine and we chatted almost the whole time... rather than a few dudes mumbling inside jokes to each other the whole time (like at V's).  I would highly recommend Laura McShane!  She took a while "getting to know my hair" and I gave her free reign to do as she pleased.  She gave me a modern haircut that is really low maintenance.  Way better than pointing at a picture of hair I found in GQ.
5 Laura McShane did an excellent job on my hair.  I received highlights, a cut, shampoo, and blowout.  I looked like a different person when I left the salon.  The highlights look amazing and hide my gray hairs.  Also she was sweet to say I did not have that many.    Thank you for a great job and for such pampering and great treatment.  The other salon employees were very friendly and welcoming as well.    Can't wait to come back.   **Quick Update.  I had my hair blow dried straight.  I got it wet this morning and now it is back to its curly self.  The cut is beautiful and the highlights are perfect too.
5 Ok I think I am becoming a serious salon junkie.  I had Laura McShane do a Brazilian Blowout.  It is hot and humid today and my hair is stick straight and so soft and pretty.  Laura went out of her way to make sure I knew how to care for my hair after I leave the salon and made sure I left with the look I wanted.  Wonderful salon and service.
5 Ms. Lisa Stevens is a makeup artist at Salon Surreal. I'm a film and television actor in Phoenix and Los Angeles. Lisa has done my makeup a few times and I've been very pleased. Recently, however, I asked Lisa about permanent makeup as I have a difficult time applying eye liner. Lisa did an amazing job on my upper eye lids! I can't speak highly enough of her work!!
5 The best thing about a haircut by Keiko is the precision of her work.  The bad thing is that it grows out so perfectly that I don't have to go back for several months, yes - it continues to look great for that long!!    I've been to other places/people and my hair is just not as happy as when Keiko cuts it.
1 I had some red haired younger girl that had piercings. I told her that I wanted my hair a little bit darker for the fall. She assured me it wouldn't be too drastic at all. I have naturally light blonde hair.  I left the salon with almost black hair. What a waste of $200 and a few hours.   My hair was also very greasy when I left.  So I am currently at another salon getting a color correction. Thanks for nothing.
4 Thanks Yelpers for recommending this place. I've used Yelp reviews for ever, but this is my first time reviewing. I had my hair done on Saturday at a different salon. Lets just say that I have never hated my hair so much after that. I wanted a nice caramel color, with lots of depths and highlights. Well what I got was a dark mocha with weird almost white highlights. After doing some research, I found Salon Surreal. At first it sacred me that even though they had many great reviews, most of them were a year old at least. I called on Sunday, and I got an appointment for Monday morning. The salon itself is located for in a little strip mall.  My appointment was with Bree. Let me tell you what a goddess this woman is!!!!! She is very nice and approachable. I'm so glad my appointment was with her. She not only got my hair as close to the color that I wanted, she did it without damaging it and in less than 2 hours. Bree took the time to understand what I was going for and explained what she was doing throughout the whole process, she even fix my haircut as the other place had butchered it. My hair is now a nice dark caramel, with an ombre fade into a light caramel color. She even warned me that she was worried my roots would come in darker and that I might not like the color transition. If that happened she recommended that I set up an appointment for a toner.  The best part, the price was very reasonable I will definitely be coming back, Bree will be my to go girl from now on.
5 Bree is amazing! I had to get my color done on a work trip so I was extremely nervous trying out a new one time stylist but I wish I could use her everytime! She knew exactly what I wanted, was super friendly and gave me good tips for the city! Loved her!
5 Elegant and excellent service and salon.  I do believe coming here is my new hobby.   Laura McShane is a wonderful person and stylist.
5 A good friend of mine recommended this Salon. And I was at first hesitant because I wasn't sure what to expect. I really liked how my friend's hair was done. I had my hair cut short, new blond hair and highlights and stylized by the fabulous stylist Ellie. She really knows her craft. She was friendly, and she had great ideas when I asked her for suggestions for my hair. The salon has friendly staff, comfortable setting, the music was not very loud like other salons I have been to before. When my hair was washed afterwards it was relaxing and there was even beautiful relaxing music in the background. It was a fun days out!  I had some great hair therapy fun. And love my new hair! I'm definitely coming back! Thank you Ellie!
5 I really love this Studio. Decorated modern & clean. Great vibe. I see Allison Hyatt and she does an AMAZING JOB!!! I have tricky hair and it's hard to get the highlights I want but Allison does it PERFECTLY!!! If you're looking for a great hair salon, try out Salon Surreal but make sure you ask for Allison Hyatt!!!!
5 I started seeming Kari a while back. She does my eyebrows and skin treatments. Kari is the best!!!! She is very welcoming and she makes you feel right at home. Explains everything well and makes sure you are satisfied.  The room where waxing and skin treatments are done is very zen. It is clean and peaceful .  She offered full waxing services as well as several skin treatments including chemical peel. Many different kinds of customized facials and chemical peels.   Prices are great as well and they run monthly specials as well. Let's just say chemical peel is half price then what it costs me at my dermatologist office.    The best at of all of this is that Kari uses PCA skin product. This skin care line is purely amazing and it has been invented locally in Arizona. It is so light weight and it recovered my skin from acnes. PCA also has aging line.  I can't say enough how great PCA skin product is as well as Kari. You will have to check it out yourself and believe me, you will not regret it.
5 Mariah is a great stylist.  Called to make an appointment and they had us in a few hours later.   The cut and condition was for my little sister - she's 14.   Walked-in (no wait), Mariah met with us a minute or two later.   My sister wanted a short "pixie-cut", but wasn't sure exactly HOW she wanted it. Prior to coming into the salon, her and I scrolled Google/Pinterest for example cuts. Her choices ranged from Jennifer Lawrence's recent bob to Goldie Hawn's short, vintage do in the 1960's. hahah. Needless to say, this could've turned ugly really quick, literally AND figuratively.   Thank God and Mariah, it didn't.   She was very, very attentive to my little sister's wants. She cut and stopped, showing sister where she was at in terms of length and style and waited patiently as I explained to sister, "hey, be honest if you like it or not". Great with kids (okay, okay 14) young women. She styled her hair, then walked her through on how to style it herself and what would be the best tools to use. My sister loved it.   It is an up(per)-scaled salon, but you get what you pay for, right. Trust me, it's worth every penny. Ask for Mariah - you won't regret it.
3 I had a good experience at this salon. The salon was very nice, they even greeted me drink in hand. I had a very nice stylist who was easy to make conversation with! However, I am giving this place 3 stars because I felt like I way overpaid. I paid $60 for a "just ok" haircut.  I have been to several other salons where I get a better haircut for cheaper. That being said, I probably won't return. However, they do have great customer service.
