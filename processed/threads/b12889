2 Tempe's long awaited and much anticipated skate park landed with a thud, i thought. location sucks, complaints are it's very technical, but it does have a concrete picnic table. the bowl ledges have real coping, so i'm not sure, but would imagine bikes are a no-go. full pads are REQUIRED, helmets, i'm not sure.
3 Lots of good lines here, nothing gnarly vert but plenty of lines to be had. Stick to the back half of the park if you're a tranny rider. Half bowl with shitty pool coping, small cradle, various hips, and a few extensions. Show up early morning or right before close. Little fuckers on razor scooters, rollerblades & skateboard camp kids plague this place. Suggestion : get blazed in car prior to entering park.
