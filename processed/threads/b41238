5 Great place to take kids. Plenty of activities, its safe, well surpervised, and a multitude of areas for kids to play in.
5 My 5 & 8 year old children spent 3 hours doing crafts, exploring and playing!   Favorite features were the musical instruments outside, recyclable crafts, black light camping room.  Love the inspirational quotes on the wall.  Price is unbeatable.  Can't wait to go back when the new exhibit opens.  Gift shop prices are very reasonable too!
5 This was our second time here. Our son is 1&1/2 and we have taken our niece and nephew 5&7. All three of them had a great time, there is a great variety of activities for each age group and other general exhibits for all ages. Compared to some other museums in the valley their prices are great and they have multiple trip packs and annual memberships. Great family activity!!!
2 I really didn't think this place was so great.  It was kindof like things that would be in a preschool, in one big place.  Big squishy building blocks, a play kitchen, paper crafts.  We're here for a short time, and I was debating which area children's museum to take my 3 and 4 year old boys to.  We were close to this one so I picked here.  It's ok, maybe for wee little kids, that aren't in preschool yet.  The current exhibit installation was about travel.  It was cheap, $7 per person over the age of 1, but I'd rather pay a little more and have more to do.  My house is filled with toys and paper scraps and junk to make macaroni necklaces, I was expecting this to have something that would spark their little minds more.
