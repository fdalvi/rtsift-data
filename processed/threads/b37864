4 Just walking by to see what Gangnam had to offer when the friendly hostess popped outside and talked us into coming in for dinner. I'm so glad that she did. Second day of being open, and they are killing it! Really fresh decor, SUPER friendly staff, neat concept for dinner. We tried the stir fried sukiyaki veggie udon noodles, spicy garlic edamame, mushroom medley, BBQ rib eye, and the Korean honeyeyed pancake with ice cream.  Everything was so incredibly tasty. The sauce on the udon noodles was so delicious and the veggies were fresh and cooked to perfection. The edamame was the perfect appetizer. I would definitely recommend to give this place a try.   I really hope that they do well- I can't wait to go back!
2 Not even open a week, this restaurant has problems with kitchen efficiency and with service. It's almost like they all just showed up and started doing things without any prior conversation or coordination.  They haven't got a liquor license yet and still they won't allow patrons to bring their own wine!  Now that's just dumb. Virtually every other restaurant in town, and especially the ones with no liquor license will allow corkage.  I asked if they'll allow corkage once they DO get a license, and the answer was "we'll take it under advisement".   Well, I've got news for these guys: I'll take it under advisement as to whether I ever return.
4 Great find! Place is super clean, decor is modern and atmosphere was really good. The ribeye, kobe and chicken  were delicious. Bonus for us was when the waiter told us the chicken was organic!  My 10 yr old loves to grill at the table so we frequent gyo-kaku grill at home BUT this place has better food and prices.
4 Great Meat, Not all you can Eat and No Side Dishes. But Super Nice servings are 4 oz and from $6-$13. Great Place go for lunch special from 11 am - 3 pm
4 Checked out this place with my friend while we were in vegas. He just returned from a trip to korea and loves Korean food. This place was good although it was missing the sides that generally come with korean bbq and we were surprised to find that the sake was more expensive than the soju. All and all, I'd try it again.
4 Ambiance and service were phenomenal.  I will definenatly be back. Now for the bad.  They don't carry side dishes which is my favorite part of a Korean meal.  So I will still make a 20 minute drive out to Soyo because of their high quality kimchi side dishes and complimentary barley tea.
4 I loved it here....  I was staying across the street at Hardrock and wandered over....being a huge Yaki Niku fan I figured it was worth a try....I realized right away they were not Japanese but that's not important these days...the quality of the meat was good and the service was amazing...  I asked the waiter for atsukan....and he had no idea...so I told him it means hot sake...I was in one of those moods....I did send back a few pieces of the tongue they sent me, however the chef then replaced my tongue order and in addition made me another chefs special dish on the house....my friend and I left full of wagyu beef....happy...and maybe $60 lighter....which is a deal, given we were drinking...
3 Came in for a late dinner during the week. The restaurant is in a strip center and parking was easy to secure.  The interior of the place is decorated modern and has 2 flat screens to watch your fave sporting event. Each table has a grill to cook your food. My Hawaiian waitress was friendly and sweet but for a Korean joint I was disappointed the only banchan you receive is Kim chi. I ordered shrimp with head on and sliced prime rib beef. My order  didn't include miso soup and steamed rice so there was an up charge. I did enjoy the three dipping sauces for the entrees which were ponzu, sweet and a spicy sauce. The beef was tender but it was a only 4 ounces for $11.95 The shrimp was decent but was priced at $5.95 for 4 pcs and were on the small side and I've had fresher.  Overall I thought the decor and service was solid, but the food fell short on value and quality and don't think I would return.
5 I haven't been this satisfied with Asian BBQ before! I've been to Sura BBQ and Tofu hut, but they don't even compare to Gangnam. Sura is too pricey and I am a little taken back by how they place the raw meat outside.  Anywhoo, Gangnam was a nice alternate to that, since they serve you your food like Tofu Hut. However the quality of the meat is far tastier. Everything that I had was delicious!   We ordered the beef belly, BACON WRAPPED SCALLOPS, spicy garlic edamame, fried chicken karrage and the banana tempura with ice cream. This is definitely one of the rare occasions where i can honestly say i loved every bite. The service was phenomenal and we came during happy hour. They also have a Robata special after 10pm, must try!  The proportions were excellent and presentation was beautiful. (Especially the beef belly and banana tempura)  The exterior of the restaurant does not give it justice to the inside because i was pleasantly surprised by how pretty it was in there, and I did not expect a place like that to be so close to UNLV.   The ambiance is appropriate for all types of parties from romantic to large parties. (:  I will definitely return & try the whole menu!
5 Omg. The food was delicious!  Our group was 4 people. We got the butterfly and firecracker shrimp. Bulgogi bimpap and bbq the following meats: grade a kalbi, kurobuta sausage and shrimp. Most delicious yall! Im coming again tomorrow night. Love how they stay open late and offer delicious food with awesome service. The apple sake was yum as well, just keep it nicely chilled. Going back tomorrow for the lychee sake (:
5 Sooo loved!! From the ambiance to the food..def be back. It had a fun atmosphere/feel to it. Music vids playing while ESPN highlights (for the bf) played! And the food was amazing. Got the paradise meal and it came with everything..appetizers, soup, rice (bulgogie rice was super good), and meats & veggies! Can't wait to go back!!
4 PRO: trendy, clean, excellent quality, bulgogi, bibimbap, udon. CON: no appetizer with meal (typical for Korean)
5 Don't pay attention to the bad reviews. I suggest you go and take advantage of their happy hour/lunch specials; they have great quality meat. The interior is very clean, roomy, and low-lit (great place for a romantic meal). The tables are clean and it seems like they take real good care of the grills as well.  I have never heard of this restaurant since they opened and oh my god... I am so glad now that I have! First of all, as a student, I think the location is great! It is literally across the street from UNLV. On my first visit here (also my first time in an asian bbq style restaurant), I was quite confused with their menu, but my server, a lovely Filipino young lady, was very helpful. She took her time explaining the different combos that they offered. I ended up getting the Meat Lover combo, which came out looking very fresh. What I loved most is that it came with miso soup, a salad, a bowl of sticky rice, and 3 different sauces for my meat. On my second visit, I had the same Filipino server. It was also during their happy hour, so select dishes were up to 50% off. I had the Meat Lover again (I can't help it--I love my meat!).  If you are into asian bbq and are near the area, I would highly recommend trying out Gangnam.
3 Coming from an experienced La Korean BBQ vet, it's hard to be compared to anywhere else. Gangnam Asian BBQ is no exception. I ordered the bulgogi bibimbap, and was sadly disappointed with the selection. It was rice and bulgogi....that was it. The waitress came by and she even look as displeased at me. What was surprising was that she didn't do anything about it, which was saddening. I can't say that it was their fault, since that's what I ordered, but if a customer looks dissatisfied it should raise an alarm to do something about it! Learn from this, the restaurant has potential.
5 I used to only go to all you can eat bbq places. However, these days I prefer quality over quantity and Gangnam is just that. I absolutely LOVE this place!!   Good vibe, good music, and I like all the Kpop music videos they play on the screen. I like how they treat you as you are walking in and very friendly servers!   Hint: Happy hour specials!! Seems like the owner is re-inventing the menu every so often for the better!
4 We came on a Saturday night and the restaurant was not busy at all. It has a cute asian decor and very nice ambiance. Patrick the server came and acknowledged us and seat us right away. Since nobody was there at that time he let us chose our own table. He was very friendly and answered all our questions about the menu. He recommended the bulgogi bibimbap to my husband and it was so good! I had the beef kalbi and beef belly. Loved the kalbi but not the belly. After dinner we had dessert. I ordered the friend banana tempura with strawberry ice cream and Man oh Man! Their banana tempura is the best of its kind! Better than PF Changs banana spring rolls. It's worth every calories! I'll probably come back just to order this. :)
4 First time I came here was with my cousin, and then they already got me hooked on their happy hour menu. Then just yesterday me and my boyfriend came in and we found out happy hour is all day PLUS buy one get one free beer?! Hell yeahhh! (: We ordered the: salmon carpaccio, korean kalbi, karage, calamari. I highly recommend all of them.  Owner is nice, server was nice and atmosphere was pretty upbeat.  Definitely worth the 30 min drive from my house even tho I have a korean bbq 5mins away.   my new favorite korean bbq
4 So Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining has been opened for awhile, but I only just noticed it very recently.  It is a Japanese and Korean DIY BBQ restaurant, where you can order items a la carte or from one of their many preset combinations.  It is a similar concept to Yagu (on the West side) and many other J or KBBQ restaurants in California.  Based on reading the past reviews (very helpful in convincing me to drive to this side of town for just a meal and go then back) and the photos posted for this business and comparing it to my first hand experience here, I can deduced that the restaurant has experimented with various promotions before settling on their current all day Happy Hour promotion.  Gone are their lunch special menu or previous versions of their HH menu.  Now you get 1/2 off selected beverage items and discounted menu items.  The food I was served was good and tasted even better when cooked properly and to the exact doneness that I want.  And since it was not AYCE, I did not felt subconsciously compelled to overindulge during the meal with the final destination dangerously close to meat coma station.  Price was reasonable, not cheap when you add everything up, but you get good quality for the price.  The server was very friendly and helpful, as was the owner or the restaurant manager/model (yeah, she definitely exudes the essence of Gangnam style). The restaurant itself looks very nice (posh with well executed design and decoration).  Suggested party size for dining here is up to 4 per table, as you have to share the grill built into the table.  Don't wear anything that you don't want smelling like it was generously sprayed with the delicious smell of sweet BBQ smoke after you leave or have a change of cloth for going back to work. Best time to come is after work so you can take advantage of their HH drink specials without having to feel like an alcoholic for the 2nd part of your work day.  Bulgogi, Korean Prime Short Rib and the Kurobuta (Japanese Pork) Sausage was what I ordered to be grilled and is what I would recommend to others trying out this restaurant.  No free banchan here, but you can order their Kimchee and Pickles (both are $0.00) to compliment your meal.  Solid 4 stars experience based on the service, food, atmosphere and price to value.
5 Food was awesome, service was very attentive! Great late night dining spot too.  Get the Kobe beef!
5 This review is too long over due, this restaurant is how do you say Awesome!!! from the time you walk in and is greeted by the hostess which is a good looking, sexy , hot Filipino lady, the second thing that came to my mind was order your food,the Interior and ambiance was definitely up to par,there is a flat screen TV that was showing Asian news and a large projection screen  TV that was showing a Asian dance videos, teppan style tables,also a sushi bar area in the rear,you can have your photo taken and place on the wall with the others 50 plus there.I had the make your own lunch set, fire cracker chicken, spicy cucumber, chicken basil, rice, and miso soup,the food was season very well and delicious,buy one beer or sake you get one free (Sapporo, Asahi, Hite, Soju, Sake..cold or hot) happy hour is all day long the menu has a lot of tasty Item to offer,Hard Rock Hotel to the west and UNLV is the the east......Recommended.
4 Great service and food. They were nice enough to cook up my barbecue as I multi-tasked with studying for an exam. Everything I ordered was wonderful. The scallops wrapped with bacon, the Kobe sliced beef and the fried pot-stickers and brown rice option were the best. I flavor was great and so was the atmosphere.  I plan to return.
4 Japanese style BBQ but I enjoyed they serve free Kimchee that taste was great.
4 We went off the strip for our final meal before leaving Las Vegas on Thanksgiving weekend.  This Korean BBQ restaurant is on Paradise Road just behind the northern strip hotels.    Although the strip mall it is located in seemed busy, the restaurant itself was pretty vacant for a Sunday night at 6:30PM.    They gave us a menu with "happy hour" pricing on most of the food packages, which I'm not sure if that is given at all times or not.  Anyway, 4 stars.  The decor is really nice, the service is very attentive, the food was great.  They bring all the food to you. The Miso Soup was delicious. The meats were brought to our table, and they ask if you want assistance in cooking them at your table; however, we declined and cooked them ourselves.  Everything was fresh and delicious.    Minus one star for one reason only.  I thought the prices were a bit high with the "happy hour" pricing.  If the prices are truly higher during peak hours, I would definitely not come back.  At the "happy hour" prices, I would consider a return, although it is still a bit expensive for what it is.
2 This place was a real let down.  I had dinner here with a couple friends and we were all of a similar opinion.  First off the prices are a bit over inflated as is evident by the constant "sale" prices on the menu, everything is apparently half off and it still is not worth it.  We ordered a combination that allowed us to try just about everything they had on the menu.  The only items that I would have given more than two stars were the bulgogi and some fried chicken bites in a spicy sauce.  The scallops we ordered were not cooked properly (almost raw) and had a bit of funky fishy taste to them (in an old scallop way).  The service was very poor and quite slow.  When we brought the quality of the scallops to our server's attention, he commented "well, that just how they are here." As someone who enjoys good Korean BBQ, I had high hopes for this restaurant, but it simply failed to impress and for the money you would be much happier going somewhere else, like Honey Pig.
4 A really cool, modern, comfortable BBQ Place!  I would give this place a 5 star, if their banchan selection was more extensive.  However, for the location, the food and the service, I will definitely be coming to this place, again and again...  A.  Location - Harmon, Swenson, Paradise.  There is a small strip mall there that has plenty of food choices and this location is perfect for so many.  Right across from Hard Rock....  B.  The Service - extremely efficient and pleasant. I came here for lunch and while it was not terribly busy, the server was just right in being very efficient, always there when you wanted her, very nice and top notch.  C.  The Menu - Loved the menu.  The cuts here are smaller in size and also more reasonable in portion and pricing. You can order a huge variety of different meats, seafood and veggies all ranging in prices form 3.00 to 12.00 per plate.  I loved the mix and match. IF I brought my glasses and had more time, I would have done this.  Instead, I turned over the menu to the combo page and pre-ordered one of the combos to make it easier for me.  D.  The Food-   a.  Miso Soup - OK, so we are in a Korean restaurant and they serve Miso soup. I find that odd, and at same time I really cannot complain since it was tasty.  However, when I am eating BBQ, I like the real basic soup that is plain and simple.  b.  The meats -   Chicken Tender Cheese Fondue -   OK, I am not a huge non traditional foodie, but man, this was really cool and tasty.  Bulgogi - Wow was that really fast and the sauce was PERFECT.  Filet Mignon - So tender and juicy...  Shrimp Garlic - Would have preferred Shrimp PRAWN, but these tiny morsels were okay.  Harami Miso - Man was this steak just right. Never had it before and I really enjoyed it.  Assorted Veggies - Cool. Normal stuff. but those corn on the cob were awesome.  c.The appetizers - Again, miso soup, rice, salad and some kind of cream cheese wonton thing.  Different, okay. I prefer banchan.  E.  Come back factor - This is one cool place, the food is good, the portions are manageable so you can try different things for sure.  For business lunch, hanging out, this is a really nice restaurant and I do plan to come back.  If I am focused only on the bbq, I may try Tofu Hut or other places DJK, but I really enjoyed this Gangnam BBQ.  GK says, check it out.
4 So I meet up the homie Mike C. at this place. Been wanting to try it for a minute now. It's eveningish and not busy at all.  It has a nice, dark, and clean ambiance. I'm not too sure on the dynamics of this establishment. We were the ones manning the grill, which I had no problem with. I've had places where an angry looking Korean lady snatches the tongs away and takes over. It wasn't the usual AYCE but I'll still pho'ks with it.   The dishes we sampled was the carpaccio, pork belly, brisket, filet mignon, and prime kalbi.  I saw on Yelp that this place had beef carpaccio. Ever since Woonam Jung stopped serving carpaccio, I've been looking for another joint to replace that empty spot in my heart. Gangnam's carpaccio wasn't as extravagant as Woonam's, but just as good. Served on an oily sauce and some greens on top. Simple and delicious. This was my favorite during the feeding.  The pork belly and brisket. What can you say? It's always good. There is nothing special about these other than the pork belly being thick. Dip them things in the sesame -salt & pepper concoction and you got a happy customer.   ALRIGHTY THEN!  Now to the beef. The filet mignon was good and tender. We cooked it quickly to a nice medium rare. It was perfect! Again, I'm glad we were manning the grill. These could have easily been over cooked and ruined. We actually got another order of the filet mignon. The server finally brings in the prime kalbi. He says that this is their signature dish. It was very tender and sweet, but it didn't leave an everlasting impression with my palate. Would I still pho'ks with it?  Sure. The first four orders is a definate though. So in the end, the crack that will have me on the come back is the carpaccio and the filet mignon. WINNER!  Yay!, I'm a fan!!!
4 Place is pretty hip. It is a KBQQ joint, and they sell their meats tapas style. I'd suggest to order their korean prime kalbi, brisket, premium beef tongue, kobe style beef, spicy pork, and their filet mignon for meats. They also offer happy hour in which some of the dishes come at a discount that ranges from $2.95-9.95 per tapa order depending on the meats.   Mixxed veggies are a good choice for sides, kimchee, japanese pepper, mushroom, and asparagus. The stuff with the cheese sides aren't really worth it. I wasn't too fond of the whole cheese dipping thing, and didn't end up using it.   For the combos, the first time we came, we ordered the Paradise combo. It says it's good for two people, but we split this with a family of four. We don't eat a lot, but it was still enough to fill us up! Well, we also ordered calamari (which was also good! especially their sauce!) and their fried dumplings (beware. it's really spicy).  This place is pretty hip, they also have a nice private room for a big party. They feature this big projector screen that plays a mixture of popular music videos from here and Korea. The Korean music videos are so fun to watch even if I don't understand the language. It's a good way to help the time pass.   It's a fun hip place to go to, but every time I go it's barely full. Maybe one or two areas are taken.
5 Easy, fun and fabulous atmosphere.   Great for a date night, working lunch or with the kids!!  Pick your meat and veggies and they arrive raw. You cook them on your table top grill. Fun way to get the kids cooking. And the prices are Great!!  Ill be back for sure. Good music as well as a tv playing sports!! Great selection of sake too!!
5 my girl had to work NYE and we wanted to have a nice meal close to the Strip, but not too close.  a quick search on Yelp and decided on Gangnam.  Great decision Yelpers!  you can order everything a la carte or order one of their combo specials for two.  We did the Paradise A combo ($56 for two ppl).  our server said it was the most popular choice.  there was easily enough food for 3 people!  everything was tasty!  Five starters and five dishes to BBQ. I especially liked the spicy dumplings from the starters, and all the meat was top quality.  Service was very helpful and attentive, without being annoying.  Great place for date night (slightly romantic, but more hip and cool).  we will definitely be back!!
3 Had dinner here last night. Not really the authentic Korean barbecue that I was expecting. We had one of their popular combination specials. Meat was good, but Kimchee wasn't too good.  Service was pretty good with an easy location to find. Next time I'll try one of the other barbecue places.
5 Came here with my brothers and sister-in-law during a trip to vegas, and was more than impressed. We had our own private room in the back (even though we were just a party of 5) and the waitress was very attentive, and explained the menu well. The paradise A combo i split with my brother, and we got more than enough food for even 3 people.  The Harami Miso, prime kalbi, and calimari were all top notch. The meat and veggies were brought out quickly and you could cook them to whatever liking you choose. I'd come back here on future vegas trips.
3 I came to this restaurant for the simple reason that I had to get out of the hard rock hotel. This was right across the street and I figured anything was better than spending more time at the smoky trashy hotel that was trying too hard.  My first reaction upon seeing the menu was to be a bit taken aback by the printed discount signs on the menu. Made me think of "regular price 9.95 but just for you it's 7,50--- maybe because the food is old or no one wants to go there."  I worried too much. The food was reasonably good. Tasty Korean BBQ at an affordable price. Service was pretty indifferent. "Yes we have a smaller table but it isn't set up: why don't you sit at the bar."  And I had to wait for a fair amount of time before getting any attention to place my order. The indifferent service might account for my bulgogi being a bit on the cold side. But the food did taste good and was a good value for the money.  I
4 A great new hidden find in vegas! Their lunch happy hour is amazing prices and food is actually better than most in china town. Dynamite shrimp is a hit!
5 I am so happy this gem is not on the strip, could you imagine how over priced it would be? Came here on a Saturday night for a 7PM dinner, and the place was dead. But that was okay because my party had an entire back room to ourselves.  The service was stellar, and i'm sure most readers understand the premise of the place. You get a lot of pre-marinated meats/veggies/etc brought out to you and you cook it yourself on the mini-grill. It's so easy a 7 year old could do it (or my older brother who hardly gets credit for cracking an egg).  I recommend you get one of the pre-designed samplers. We opted for The paradise A  and we got more than enough food for two.  The Harami Miso, prime kalbi, and calimari were all yummy.  I would recommend this to anyone who is staying in Las Vegas. It is located right across the street from the Hard Rock Casino, but worth the cab ride if you are staying on the strip and to lazy to walk.
4 My first experience with Korean BBQ. I was a bit intimidated at first. The place was busy and my rookie flag was flapping wildly. I was able to get through the ordering process with the help of a super friendly waitress that set me at ease from word go.  Happy hour prices made my experience even more palatable.
4 I really enjoy this place and used to go every Tuesday for lunch. The servers are great and friendly and they are very attentive.  I love the calamari here it always is crispy, flavorful,  and doesn't have too much batter.
4 Open late and away from the hustle and bustle of the strip. Two thumbs up for late night happy hour. Lots of choices & really good quality meat. They also have soup, bibimbap, appetizer, and vegetable choices.   Try:   Meat items: harami miso, rib eye, beef bulgogi, spicy pork, toro beef, & bacon wrapped scallops!   Appetizers: poke, spicy tuna kimbap   The servers are all really friendly & accommodating. We were the only party there around 11pm but it worked out since our party had 15 people.
5 The service is really great! Great for late night groups to have a few drinks and good Asian BBQ.  The price is very reasonable. You can come dressed up on a date or totally casual. I recommend this place for people that wanna have a nice chill spot to eat good Asian BBQ.
5 It's not your typical Korean restaurant, meaning it doesn't have the all you can eat Korean BBQ. But if you're looking for quality cut meats this is a great place to dine. Been here already multiple times and still haven't tried all their dishes. Hospitality is really nice and the set up of the place has a relaxing ambience.
4 I love this place.  They have the best bibimpap. It is huge and delicious!   They have great appetizers.  The servers are nice.  They have some BBQ meats a la carte.  I tend to find something I love at a place and always get it over and over again.  It's the bibimpap here.  If I want some pork belly and NOT AYCE KBBQ then this is where I come.
4 This is PERFECT for all of you that do not want AYCE KBBQ. There aren't many of you, but if you're like, who really can't eat all that much in one sitting, it's excellent. Come during happy hour (1130am-5pm and then again after 10pm) and it'll be better bang for your buck.  We didn't eat much and was still really content and full (for me, at least). We only got short ribs, which they do remove the bones for you so it's just all meat. Then, we got beef brisket, which is pretty typical, as well as 2 orders of pork belly. I'm sad no tripe but I'll live. There are a lot of other things on the menu but I'm not a fan of marinated meat at KBBQs.  During my second visit, I got pork cheek, which was my first time eating it so I'm not sure how I feel about it yet... I wouldn't say everything is awesome-tasting but it's not too bad.  They've got a small selection of desserts but we only got ice cream ($1.95). Flavors: vanilla, green tea, and strawberry. It's a good portion size.  I doubt I'll come when it's not happy hour so there you go. But if you're in the area during happy hour, why not?
4 Great deal for Happy Hour ! Discounted prices for appetizers and meats. Its like $3 for an order of pork belly or beef toro (brisket).   Came here for "dinner" before an event i had to go to, with a friend. She had been here before and was on the way, so had me order (before it hit the end of Happy Hour time). She liked the Pork Belly and Pork Toro.   Service by this young korean waitress was superb. Very friendly and funny.   We had ordered 3 pork belly, 1 pork toro, 2 toro beef, and 1 prime kalbi.   The pork toro (pork cheek) isn't discounted. - $5.95 - As the "toro" name suggests, it is highly marbleized with some thick areas of fat on the edges. This isn't the first time i've had pork cheek (similar to pork neck meat as well). When cooked properly, and a good quality meat, it should have a super tender texture, and "crispy". Not like a hard crispy but like crisp to bite through. I cooked it in a way where it seared the fat giving it a nice crisp in the fat. The pork toro is NOT marinated or seasoned in any way. Quality, to me, seems not up to what i had imagined. Overall still not bad, but could be better. But pork cheek/neck meat is quite expensive. somewhere along $10-15/lb, wholesale. X_x   Prime kalbi - $8.45 - quality wise, wasnt that good either. For them to put the "prime" name, id expect a high quality cut of meat, flavorful and tender. Not to the point of aged meats, but you know what i mean. The prime kalbi is seasoned with some slight marinade topped with some finely minced garlic? Pieces are a fair thickness. Cooks nicely. Not as tender as i hoped, nor was it as marbleized as i have had this cut in other places.   Toro Beef - $3.45 - otherwise quoted as "Beef Brisket". By no means it is the Toro i was thinking of. It is straight up brisket, similar to that of what you get any where else. Misleading name, but i guess it was my fault for believing it may be more towards to the Toro name vs the quoted brisket name. Thin slices of meat. Cooks fast. Simple as that.   Pork belly - $2.95 - surprisingly, this was probably the best of the 4 items we had ordered. Even compared to the pork toro or prime kalbi. sad but surprising. Lol. Simple pork belly cuts.   Overall, not bad experience. Priced fair during happy hour. Pretty sure i wouldn't be ordering the meats not during happy hour though. Nice place to try if you are in the area.   They have a lot of appetizers discounted during Happy Hour as well. Didn't try any though.
4 Whenever I'm in a big enough city, I start craving Korean food.  The GF had heard from some other folks that we should go to Sura, which we had gone to a few weeks earlier.  Sura was fine, but not good/great.  I had flown into Vegas, and per a mutual agreement, had not made any special Valentine's Day plans.  We ended up here for dinner, and there were probably 3 or 4 open tables.  We were quickly seated in the modern looking space.  The menu was interesting - they had the standard combo items, where you get a mix of meat and sides, but apparently when we were there it was happy hour, and they had items that were priced in the $3 to $8 so that you'd order a serving of beef toro, spicy pork, sides, etc  - almost felt like a tapas place, though obviously meat heavy.  Quality of the meat seemed a little better than Sura.  We were a little surprised that the kalbi/short-ribs had the bones removed, but that was fine.  All the meat and sides we had were good, and the gas grill worked fine.  I was also glad to see that they had spicy cucumber as a side, which is one of my favorite forms of kimchi.  The small plate style of ordering probably kept us from over-eating as much as an AYCE joint, but I was feeling nearly as full.  The one miss we had was that we had ordered white rice, but it didn't come out till we were almost done (which had included a second round of ordering).  I had asked about it earlier to one of the staff, and they nodded, and wandered away like they were on it, but didn't bring out any rice.  My guess is that they had gotten slammed at some point, and ran out of rice, so they had to make more, but that's only a guess.  No one said anything, and when they did bring out the rice near the end of the meal.  Overall, our damage with tip was an even $50, which was considerably less than the $72 we had spent at Sura, and I left feeling more satisfied with my meal.
4 Traditional Bibimbap is quite delicious.  Service was great too. If you want something off the strip that is worth checking out, I'd recommend this
5 My fiancé and I came here for dinner the night he proposed to me. It was late about midnight and there were only a few other people there. This place is fun and romantic, definitely setting the mood for the amazon night ahead of us. We had the premium combo with Kobe beef, need tongue, shrimp rice bumpy bop or something, among other yummy things. This was my first taste of Kobe beef and I certainly fell in love. The meat is fresh and well as the veggies. I love how you can cook your food perfectly the way you want it.  The staff was very friendly and not very invasive. Always refilling our drinks and occasionally checking on us, making sure we were enjoying our experience.   The price is a little steep, but what do you expect when you order Kobe beef. I would have paid more. I'm sure there are less expensive places in china town but this was close to home.   Over all we had a very good experience, the food was delicious and the staff was very nice. I will be going back.
5 This place does happy hour on food 7 days a week! Til 5pm then 10-2am.  Really yummy, clean and nice. I don't feel uncomfortable for being a white girl at Korean BBQ like I do at other joints in town. Really friendly guy waiter every time I come here late night. Sapporo on draft too!
4 went here last night after the fiance got in and it was pretty good. I was surprised though that our bill still came out to $50. I thought everything had a lot of taste and the staff was very nice.   We got the following:  House salad - good size for the price Squid - about 5 pieces for $6 but it was good Kalbi - We got hte $8 kalbi meat which was like 6 small pieces so i felt that could have been a bit bigger cuts Bi Bim Bap - $10 - big portion and bf said it was good Also got a couple of veggies - mushroom melody and peppers - both were good as well.   overall not bad if you are not looking for AYCE.
5 Oppa Gangnam Style!   Oh, wait! that's PSY's line. Actually, Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining is Tapa Style and not all you can eat Korean BBQ, (keep in mind, AYCE KBBQ it's not big in Vegas than it is in Cali).   We happened to come here during their Happy Hour menu offerings. So we paid for some of the meat choices at a really good price. For that we ended up doubling are orders of the: Toro Beef, Basil Chicken, Bulgogi Beef, Spicy Pork and Pork Belly. The portions we got were good for a party of three.   - Toro Beef: Its marbleized beef brisket and very flavorful. Not as fatty as the ones that you"ll find at cheaper Korean BBQ places. It was my favorite out of our five choices.   - Pork Belly: Standard cut pork. Not bad at all, they were seasoned. The quality of the pork was good, and had tastiness to it.   - Spicy Pork: Tender cut pork. Smothered in spicy sweet marinade sauce makes this super delicious.   - Chicken Tender Basil: Tender white pieces of chicken. With touch of lemon and basil. They were simple but delicious and it accommodated well with my white rice.   - Bulgogi Beef: Beef was really tender and marinaded with a lot of flavor, very good!  nuff said.   The sauces that came with these were: Spicy Soy Sauce, Sweet Soy Sauce and Ponzu Sauce. The Spicy and the Sweet Soy were good. I even combined the sauces and it even adds for more taste to the tip of your tongue. The Ponzu, was the one I enjoyed dipping my meats in. It had that vinegar, sweet flavor to it.  Overall meat quality here, Excellent! The five choices we got didn't disappoint. Every meat was tender and easy too eat. Again, they were less fatty. We enjoyed every bite that came out of the mini-grill.   We got friendly service here. Our server was very personable, and she turned out to be a cool chick. We even got some Kimchi's on the house. Atmosphere here is modern. There is a big screen TV in one side that would play random upbeat music videos. Also there appears to be space to lounge or dance for the late night vibes.   Even though they don't offer all you can eat. They do combinations, but anything extra outside of that, can get pricey. That's why when they offered the Happy Hour menu, we chose meats with deeper discounts and for a party of three the portions were just right, for a tab around $35.   Eh, sexy lady...nom,nom,nom,nom...Oppa NomNom Style!
5 Amazing！It's my best ever in Las Vegas！The design，BBQ and service....... Oh,man everything is awesome!
4 Came in on Saturday night and this place was totally empty. I was a party of 1 because I had been desperately craving Korean BBQ. The prices are pretty reasonable, although I know most of you will whine that they aren't AYCE. They have slightly lower prices on certain meats during lunch and happy hour. I started off with the typical pork belly, beef brisket and seaweed salad. I must say the quality of meats is a step above the other AYCE places on Spring Mtn. hence you get what you pay for. Both meats were very delicious and I was still a tad bit hungry so my server recommended to me pork toro. The meat was just okay and I actually prefer the pork belly instead of this, plus it's cheaper too. The service was good for the most part, but since the place was empty, at one point the server and host both disappeared on me, which delayed me from ordering my second round of meat. It wasn't too big a deal because someone eventually appeared again in the dinning room. I live really close to this place and I will probably be coming more often. This is a perfect option if you want Korean BBQ, but your waistline can't afford to do AYCE. Also a nice place for lunch, because if I would of stuck to the beef brisket, pork belly and rice my bill would of been around $10. Can't wait to come back especially since eating here won't break my budget.
5 Brought my sis and best friend here for the first time, they have never done a Korean BBQ and they loved it!!!  Can't wait to be back!!! So good food service and price! I think it's the only Korean BBQ in vegas I would go to...just right benone the strip!
3 I tried numerous things on the menu and I have several favorites. some are great and some and just okay. Overall, I recommend this place.
4 Wow, these people need to get their butts to the east coast because MAN WILL I MISS THIS.  For Asian BBQ, yes, it looks daunting and overpriced when you first look at the menu. 4oz for 7$ is like paying 7$ for nothing. But when you order the combos for 2 people, you're actually getting enough for 3 or 4. Get one of those and a la carte the few selections you really enjoyed and you're bill will be about 100$ total for 6 people! Not bad, right?  When they ask what kind of rice you want - normal or bulgogi mixed - definitely get the bulgogi. That stuff was the bombbbbbbbbbbbbb. Perfectly sweet to go along with the savory meat!
1 Very horrible service. We want add something, call waiter about three times. I'm allergic to onion. Order told him "we every food no onions" but still had Onions inside, The waiter like didn't hear.   We come here for the first time a good time. We order the combo, it's a good deal. This is the second time come here to eat with friends. The same order, of all the food are reduced. The service also very poor. Two waiters in flirting and chating, didn't listen to the guest's calling. Empty plate on the table and no one clean. I never come again.
5 Amazing everything how I've had at friends house's home made! Really nice staff and waitresses,  cool atmosphere.
2 The hubby and I got the Gangnam combo. It was way overpriced! I feel like a fat ass for saying this but it was not enough meat. I'm spoiled by the generous portions from the other KBBQ places I've been to. The vegetables included in the combo were random and awkward too. The combo does not come with your traditional banchan (Korean side dishes). No kimchi, no lettuce, none of the usual Korean sauces for your meat. We did get three sauces-ponzu, glazed sauce, and a somewhat spicy sauce. It wasn't terrible but without my banchan, there was something lacking for sure. Yes, I realize it's not a traditional KBBQ restaurant-some Korean/Japanese BBQ fusion. The service was good though. The restaurant is modern, clean, and trendy but that's not enough for me to come back.
3 I usually cringe at the cost of a restaurant where you cook your own food but Gangnam is surprisingly affordable, especially if you take my advice and order the combos for your group. The menu says they are for 2 people but we had a group of 4 and the combo filled us all.  You can always add one or two items a la carte if you are still hungry.  The meat is surprisingly well marbled and tender and fresh.  The sauces are perfect compliments to the meet.  I thought the salad was a little bit of an afterthought as it was mostly lettuce but we still ate it. Our favorite was the bulgogi bibambap.  The service felt a little off as they had a difficult time understanding and we were very conscious that they were watching us the whole time.  I understand it is your job to clear our table as we finish a plate but there are ways to be less intrusive about it. Also, they were fixing a light in the restaurant while we were all there.  Still, this place is very enjoyable and reasonably priced.
4 Really good Japanese/Korean BBQ fusion. The ambiance is nice and clean with a modern edge, well ventilated tables meant my hair didn't smell like smoke after, and servers are pleasant and eager to please.  We did NOT get a combo, but instead ordered a-la-carte, mostly premium meats with a simple bowl of rice, kimchi and pickles. We satisfied our hunger, enjoyed almost every meat dish, and cleansed our pallets with a dessert all for less than the combo price...the difference? We didn't fill-up or waist money on the appetizers (that come with the combos).
5 I always come to this place because it's location happens to be near my house and the food is yummy. U order the food a la carte but still fills me up and is kept in my budget. I like to come here with my girlfriend because the booths make me feel like I'm in a private place. The restaurant looks like it is brand new and I enjoy the music videos that they play on their projection which is a mix of Korean, American Pop, and some funny ones like Boy Dance Party from SNL. If you get Kristin as a server, you're in great hands! She is very helpful at suggesting food items and checks on our table at a consistent rate. She actually looks like she enjoys her job and enjoys serving you . The staff has always been attentive with my water also as I am a fast drinker. Their servers speak fluent English too   My usual order consists of brown rice, kimchi (free), salmon jalapeño poppers (sooo good), 2 orders of toro beef and 2 orders of pork belly. The owner is friendly, and willing to help out with anything .   This is my favorite Korean BBQ spot in Vegas , check it out!
5 Came in for a late lunch to a fairly quiet restaurant, with only one server who was hustling his few tables and doing an excellent job juggling them.   We ordered Bibimbap ($12) and spicy Sukiyaki Noodles ($9), our server tossed the dishes for us on their sizzling hot plates, brought us hot tea and let us eat our enormous portions in quiet recovery (this IS Vegas after all, who isn't having breakfast at early dinner time, and nursing some form of hang over?).   As the restaurant got busier, our solo server got some help as a new guy started his shift, and we weren't forgotten in the hustle.  The interior of the restaurant is soothing, Asian minimalism, a nice balance between Japanese and Korean stylings, as is the food. I love trying restaurants off the strip in Vegas, as they are SO much better quality and pricing than anything near the touristy parts.   Gangnam was so much more appetizing than anything we could have hoped for on a post-EDC weekend  ;D  Located in the corner of a mini-mall, if you love legit, delicious, fine Asian dining, you MUST come here!
5 Came in for lunch we were the first ones there so we we're quickly seated. We both got the lunch set which comes with rice, miso soup and a salad. We chose to do the al la carte option because we weren't too hungry. We got the marinated Kali, bacon wrapped asparagus, the spicy tuna something appetizer and the spicy garlic sauce. We ordered the green tea mango cheese cake with mango ice cream for dessert. The portions we're small but we weren't very hungry and we're full. Our bill was $35. I liked that we had the option to either cook it ourselves on the grill or have the kitchen cook it. Everything was delicious will definitely come here again
5 I just finished eating at this Korean restaurant and it was delicious! The moment I walked in it was very clean and eye opening. It is centrally located so it is perfect for anyone looking for a good BBQ place. Even though there were only two servers tonight they did a pretty good job overall. It started to get packed as the evening went on so I knew that this place was good. I tried a lot of things actually: prime kalbi, bulgogi, pork belly, oysters, miso soup, and even dessert. I wish I could have tried everything but I will save that for the next time I will be there. I even have a feeling that the owner/manager was out and about seating customers, smiling, and making people feel comfortable and right at home. To top it off, they have a projector screen on the wall to provide a little entertainment while you are cooking or enjoying your food. My server, Kristin, was very nice, polite, and outgoing. She really took care of me, always asked if everything was okay, and making sure I was never thirsty. How can you get better than that? I would recommend Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining to anyone who wishes to have great food, great service, and very reasonable prices.
5 I have tried many Korean BBQ places and I have to say this restaurant stands out the most! I have heard so many good things about Gangnam Asian BBQ and finally gave it a try tonight. The ambiance of the interior was really intimate and it was very clean. It really sets the mood for dates or whenever you're in the mood for binge eating KBBQ with your friends, which is what I did.   The food was delicious! The meats were served fresh and presented nicely. What came to my surprise was that they served Thai Tea, which made my visit even more satisfying. We ordered the miso soup, pork belly, prime kalbi, bugolgi, the bacon wrapped enoki just to name a few and Yuuum! Belly was satisfied! What adds variety of flavor to your meat is the three different sauces they present you with. There is a vinegar like sauce, a sweet sauce, and a spicy sauce, which really gives you multiple choice on flavorings for your food.Of course trying their desserts was a must so I went for the banana tempura. This was so goood. The banana tempura was served hot off the frying pan and what helped balanced that out was the vanilla ice cream. It was a great ending to my meal. The prices overall are perfect for what they serve you.  All in all I have to say my visit was great! The owner even came out and checked on us. He was so friendly and he looked happy to see his customers. I will be coming back for more!
5 When I go to a Korean barbecue place, I always go for all you can eat because I can get most of my money worth. Gangnam isn't all you can eat, but you are still getting your money worth.  Atmosphere is that of a high end restaurant. Dimly lit, fancy decorations, expensive looking grills, professional looking servers, & popularly hip music. What caught my attention the most was a projector showing music videos of not only well known recent English music, but they also have popular Korean groups also. I find myself dancing & singing along.  The servers are very helpful in recommending what to order. They're able to describe each dish or drink well enough to make a decision. They also give honest opinions on whether one thing is better than another thing.  The meats were served looking really fresh & presented really well on a plate. Of all the Korean barbecue places not one where I've seen the meat served already seasoned.  Not many Korean barbecue places I know have a Happy Hour or lunch special. This place has pretty good deals on their appetizers & meat. For the money you spend at all you can eat places, you'll have a better experience here compared to any other Korean barbecue place in Vegas. Drinks, meats, food, desserts - you can definitely taste the difference in quality & you can even make others jealous with a picture of a nice presentation too!
5 This place always has good food, and it's a classier place to eat if you're going to be near UNLV. They don't have an AYCE option, but everything is reasonably priced. At a table with four of us in total, we ordered the following:  Steamed chili dumplings Peach saketini Fried meat dumplings Miso soup         Fried calamari w/spicy sauce Fresh oysters Prime kalbi (short rib without bone) Beef Toro (brisket)  Kobe style beef Salmon Basil Green tea cheesecake  You can also either choose to grill the food yourself or ask your server to have it cooked before bringing it to your table.
5 This isn't your usual Korean BBQ place, no all-you-can-eat here.  But the portions are generous, the staff is courteous, and happy hour just makes everything better!  We happened to arrive during their happy hour, and we were greeted promptly.  Clean, classy atmosphere.  The music is a mix of top 40 and big Kpop hits.  Service is prompt and courteous.  Nothing really noteworthy up to this point.  Then the food arrives -- everything was well-seasoned and good quality.  The meat we ordered was never chewy, a welcome change from Tofu Hut.  Their prime kalbi was surprisingly marbled, definitely my top pick of the evening, followed by the green tea/mango cheesecake for dessert.  If you're looking for tapas-style Korean BBQ, Gangnam certainly makes the grade.
5 Not AYCE?! Meh. I'm over stuffing my face with as much food as possible to make it with my money. I'm glad they didn't have the AYCE option.   For the price, which is quite reasonable, the portions are a good size. We had three meat plates (beef toro, pork belly, prime kalbi) and a few sides (oysters, dumplings, calamari, seaweed salad) , shared between three people. I was stuffed! We also ended up getting banana tempura for dessert. All in all, it was a good meal. My least favorite item probably wouldve been the calamari. But there are so many other items to order, it's not a big deal. It wasn't bad, I just have a high expectation for my calamari.   As far as service, they were on top of their stuff. Never had to ask for water. They checked on us just enough to not be annoying.   We went around 530, and we were the only people there, which worried me a bit. But by the time we left, about hour and a half later, the place was packed. So if you don't want to wait, be sure to go early.   All in all, I definitely will be back.
4 I've been there a couple of times and I am truly amazed by the fast service and the quality of the meat.  Atmosphere: I love the decor! The big projector screen is perfect for entertainment. I can eat my food while watching and singing along to music videos. The restaurant  looks very clean.  Service: the staffs are friendly and courteous. They make sure to constantly refill my glass. My server was Kristin and she was amazing! I didn't know how the menu work the first time I was there and she took the time to explain everything.  Food: OHHH MYYY GAWD. no words to describe those succulent  pieces of meat.    The only reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars is solely because it's not an AYCE BBQ :p
4 On a Saturday night, this back of the strip mall restaurant provided an enjoyable time and good food (that you cook at your own pace). The place was 50% full when we went there round 8pm. However, I think this place draws a late crowd as it is open until 2 am. Attractive staff and modern style furnished the space.   Be aware when sitting down. Check for water from the exhaust hood above. As Korean BBQ gets hot and the ac runs cold to keep it cool, condensation builds and can drip on to the table or seat. The underside of my shorts got wet when I slid into the bench style seat. (-1 star).  This place is good for 2-4, and larger tables of 8 are in the back. Super fast service! Don't be shy to flag the servers down. 3 people ran the front of the house. All 3 were at out table at some point.  We ordered a set combination of things and every bit was great. They prepared bibimbap table side and opened our mushroom foil pouch too. The grill didn't get too hot but would try this place in the winter time.  The good was of high quality and at some point, thought it may be too much. Food, 4 beers, house sake = $85 before tip. Not bad!
5 Reasonably priced for a non-AYCE dinner. You do still get good portion. Below are the items we've ordered/gotten:  Mango Saketini and Peach Saketini - alcoholic drinks, they taste like what their names are: mango and peach. LOL.  Appetizers:  Steamed Dumplings Fried Dumplings Miso Soup Seaweed Salad with shredded radish  Post appetizer/pre main course: Fried calamari w/spicy sauce Fresh oysters  Main course: Prime Kalbi Beef Toro Kobe Style Beef  Desert: Green tea cheesecake Fried Banana with Ice Cream  Service was good. Checked up on us one in a while to make sure everything was okay.   This establishment is near the strip and UNLV. So if you're around the area, a must stop!  Would come back here and try out their HH.
5 All around 5 stars  Service was timely and accommodating. Especially when it came time for the check even with a full dining room. Nothing ruins my meal more than a laggy check. A plus plus.   Food is a decent price for the variety and quality of meats, appetizers and sides. No all you can eat. But I definitely left full and satisfied with what I paid for. I feel like you can't go wrong with anything you choose. But something def worth mentioning are the desserts. The green tea cheesecake is fire. I would also suggest getting the yuzu sorbet to accompany it.   Haven't been for happy hour yet. But totally seems worth it based on my experience with dinner.
5 First time ever at a Korean restaurant and I was blown away. The BF and I came in during lunch time on a monday. The place was clean, modern, and trendy. We ordered the spicy tuna bimbap, prime kalbi, pork belly, bulgogi, and the brisket. I did not know what the heck the bimbap was when I ordered it but it was damn magic melting in my mouth. There were three dipping sauces presented to you and I was in love with the middle sweet/salty/sesame oil tasting one. IN LOVE! I should have asked for a bucket to go. Everything we had was freaking delightful. The service was awesome as well, she was so patient with us. I wish this place was closer!
4 This is the perfect spot to take friends who are unfamiliar with Korean cuisine.  The menu covers appetizers, some fusion (Korean-Japanese) dishes as well as traditional Korean BBQ meats.  The restaurant is nice and clean and there is a grill in the center of each table to cook the meat.  We had a party of six and two of our guests had no previous Korean dining experience. They liked the fact that we prepared our own food. They even had forks for these poor souls.  The outcome was that everyone had a great time and wanted to come back again when we return to Las Vegas for next year's convention.  All the items are per portion so I imagine it might take a visit or two to get the quantities right.  The server was very friendly and hip and ready to assist all the various levels of guests entering Gangnam.
