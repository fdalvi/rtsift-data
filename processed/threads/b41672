5 For the longest time, our only selections for retro pin-up/Rockabilly/Â­Psychobilly clothing was the infamous Bettie Page store, located both in the Caesars Palace Forum Shops and the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile Shops.  I mean yeah, there's Hot Topic, which is everywhere, and the independently ran 'Cash 4 Chaos' boutique located down the street from UNLV. But even they don't offer a full selection on 50s-style dresses and what-have-you.  Rockin' Bettie carries well-known brands such as Hell Bunny and accessories from Leg Avenue. I don't know if they have a house brand as I wasn't able to browse long enough to check. But since the storefront is so small, I doubt it. The prices are comparable to the Bettie Page boutiques and Hot Topic stores, ranging anywhere from the $40 to $100+. It depends on the style and brand of the apparel, so yeah.  Their selections are really cute and definitely worth browsing through!
5 I've been going to this shop since they were in the meadows mall and I'm so happy that they finally got there own place!! I love this store!! They always have an amazing selection of plus size rockabilly and pinup clothing and great accessories. The girls are always so sweet and I can't wait till they open their pinup photo shop, it's going to be amazing!! You definitely need to check this place out you won't be sorry!!
5 This shop is a little slice of rockabilly heaven right in the middle of the desert!  Rockin' Bettie's has all sizes! Men's clothes,  kids clothes and of course dresses, pants, shirts, and bathing suits. Lot's of pursues,  wallets and accessories.  The owner is awesome and super knowledgeable!
5 I absolutely love this store, the owner is very attentive and such a down to earth person. I love the way its set up and I love the new location. Not only did I find a dress that fit me perfectly but I found 2! Which is amazing even though I'm only getting one. I will definitely be shopping there more.
