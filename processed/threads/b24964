3 You know what you are getting. Come on, this isn't the best pizza in town, but close enough to many homes in the Southern Ave and 19Th avenue basin.
1 Staff is unprofessional behind the counter and there's never any hot and ready pizza ready at a place that claims this as their motto.
5 I live in the area and come here often. Excellent fast service and the crew is energetic. The pepperoni pizzas for $5 are not world changing but it feeds larges family's and no one EVER complains about pizza. I like to order ahead for a freshly made 3 meat pizza. Always done within 10 minutes.
