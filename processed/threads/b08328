1 Horrible dry and bad smelling burgers. Tried the Angus deluxe as well as the Grilled BBQ chicken wrap. Both were dry and tasted like foam, but smelt of rotten carcass. Mea Culpa for trying McDees...
1 The food was dry and tasted like it had been a couple of days old or more. very displeased !!!
1 Horrid! The girl at the drive thru told me it was 60 cents for ranch and I was purchasing 3 chicken nugget combos with fries... Are you reaaaaally that cheap mcdonalds?! NEVER AGAIN I have Never heard of a fast food chain charging for all of your ranches, fuck you mcdonalds you stingy a$$ FUCKERS truly fuck you
3 It's McDonald's. It's not like it's Wendy's across the street, but this location isn't as bad as everyone else is posting. Some times I might treat myself to fries and a chocolate dipped cone.  It's always been clean when I was there. I am disappointed that they remodeled. I liked the extra booths they use to have and the cozy "coffee house" type of layout they used to have. It's more open now, though. Just something to get used to.  The staff are decent. Nothing spectacular stands out.
