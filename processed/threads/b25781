5 The manager is very helpful, very willing to answer all the questions you have. His background in maintaining pool systems is very good and he was able to help me with every concern I had. I will definitely come back to this store for my pool needs.
5 If you live in Laveen or this area of phoenix and have a pool they are great. Great customer service and won't try and sell you things you don't need. 2 months of great service so far, and going to continue to use them for all of my pool needs.
4 I've been going here since I moved here, get my water tested for free, they tell you what you need to keep your pool running.  I also get them to come and clean my filters once a year its about $120, and it is worth EVERY penny.  I tried it by myself one time, and my husband and I had huge fight putting it together.  Get the professionals at Leslies to do it!
