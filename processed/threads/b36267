2 Just had the Big Country Breakfast Burrito. Great taste. Not big at all. Value for your dollar not so great. This is the second Carl's Jr I visited this week and portion sizes seem to be getting smaller and smaller. Not sure why Carl's Jr thinks this will get return business.
5 Carl's Jr...... Five stars???  Really??? Yes, its true. I judge a place on what it suppose to be. This is supposed to be a fast food joint. Its the same as Hardies in the midwest.  they do what they are suppose to do well.  They make there biscuits from Scratch!! The biscuits and gravy are fantastic. Service was great also. Went in and sat down. Clean and friendly.
4 Out of all of the fast food joints Carl's is tie for 1st. Gotta appreciate the military discount!
1 There was nobody running the drive through of this location at 1130pm on a Monday night. I stopped in and waited for about 5 minutes at the drive through. I was never greeted or served. Needless to say I was very disappointed to have wasted my time and gas driving to this location for nothing.
2 Service was very slow. Took at least 20 minutes to get my food when there was only one car in front of me. The girl at the drive through wasn't very friendly.  The food was ok. Well at least the burger was good. My friend got two beef tacos and she said they were gross. Jack in the box has better tacos for a better price. They weren't with the $1.50.  Probably won't be back to this location.
4 I stood in line here when it first opened to get a years worth of free food! Carl's Jr.'s is always been my favorite it was number one in my childhood never McDonald's. Same old same every time Western bacon cheeseburger fried zucchini chocolate chip cookie, best lunch ever!! The people at this location have always been very nice anytime I come through.
