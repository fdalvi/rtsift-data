3 Starbucks is Starbucks. Can't say I can review the coffee because it is pretty much the same across the company. If you like coffee at one Starbucks, you'll like it at this one too. Staff was friendly enough and got my coffee (vanilla latte) out quick. I prefer local coffee spots if I can find them, which get my four and five star ratings.
4 I do love Starbucks and this one is no different! Make sure to work towards your gold card if you're a coffee addict because who doesn't love free drinks!
4 Friendly and prompt customer service. On the small side for a Starbucks with more outside seating area than inside.
5 Great location by my gym. Constantly full of customers. Very efficient staff. Have never had a bad cup of coffee here.
