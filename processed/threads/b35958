5 We use a higher end dog food to feed our pup so we're used to driving up to Scottsdale to purchase it...so I was thrilled to discover that Pet Club opened a brand-spanking-new location near the Biltmore!  Not only is it clean and well-stocked inside but the prices for food, treats, etc. are FAR less expensive than competitors in the same caliber of pet stores.  I also want to commend the nice employee who carried my heavy, 35 pound bag of dog food out to my car for me.  Welcome to the neighborhood, Pet Club!
4 Overall pretty happy with Pet Club. I come to this location in order to pick up our freeze dried Stella and Chewey's dog food for my sweet poodle Ellie, who is literally obsessed with them.  My only complaint is that many of the dog toys are made in China. I would really like more pet stores to take a look at what sort of products they put on their shelves, as they go into our dogs mouths every day. Our vet warned us to be very concerned about the non regulation of Chinese dog toys, and for the past few years, I've had to seek out US made Dog toys.
1 I may not be the fanciest person to be walking into a store in this part of town, but I am not invisible. Waited a good ten minutes as the salesperson chatted with a woman at the counter, explaining a complicated food regimen for her cat, over and over, looking at photos on her phone, with nary any acknowledgment of me even there. Ignoring a customer ready to pay for a product standing right in front of you? Really, unheard of in direct retail. Believe it or not there are plenty of stores selling high end pet food these days, and most of these stores actually want my money. I put the bag down at the front door and walked out, still no acknowledgment. This location happens to be extremely convenient for me but it will never get my business again, it was an insulting experience.
