3 Brand new Shell gas station here in at the corner of Lake Pleasant & Happy Valley that badly needed it.  There are only 4 banks at this same intersection and no gas stations till now.  This is also the closest gas station to Lake Pleasant which is why the fuel is a good 10 cents above Circle K on 67 ave & Happy.  Brand new little store is nice so far, only about 8 pumps but its better than nothing.  Wrote the review mostly to put it on Yelp so I can check in.
5 So happy they opened.  Very nice store and closer for me to get gas on this corner than having to drive down the road.
1 I was so happy to see another station in the neighborhood.  I went in to fill up as I usually do at any station unaware that I was paying TEN CENTS MORE PER GALLON (than Circle K)  because I wasn't paying cash or using a Shell credit card.  Yes, there are signs on the pump but, really, who would think to look for such a requirement?  I've been buying gas for over 40'years and have never seen such a non-cash penalty.  I, and my children, their spouses and our friends will not be getting gas there ever again.  How disappointing and dishonest.
1 The price they post on the street (which is the same as their competitors) is only for cash or shell cards. If you pay with debit or credit it is 10 cents more. Avoid being ripped off and save your money and use the circle k down the street.
2 The location is very clean and pretty easy to get in an out of.  My one gripe with this station is that they post a price on the street which is a cash or shell credit card price.  So when you start pumping your fuel, you then notice that you may be paying $0.10/gallon more than what is on the sign.  Then you look at the sign again and see in very small letters cash or shell credit card.  For someone with a diesel vehicle that is a big price difference especially when there are places not far away, where you can get cheaper fuel.
