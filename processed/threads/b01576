3 I needed just a quick eye exam for my contact prescription and this place satisfied that need.  The least expensive of what I could find in a 10 mile radius as I wasn't willing to spend a ton.  The staff was disorganized but friendly.  Overall, for my basic needs they were great.  They seemed to have a huge selection of glasses but I didn't browse.
1 Wondering if the two pair deal is too good to be true?  It is.    I went in on a Thursday afternoon.  Two people were working and there was only one other customer in the store.  One employee greeted me and then returned to he desk to play on his cell phone.  I shopped for about a half hour trying on frames and finally left because no one would help me.    The moral of the story: no one will help you if you are standing by the $79 frames.
2 If you are looking for cheap frames that are made in China(most of them) - perfect store for you. Most of the frames look alike with very little variety. We ordered sunglasses for my daughter that she can use during sports - they had to send it out. When we ordered - they said it'll be about a week & they'll call us when it comes back. 2 weeks later - haven't heard a thing from them & when I called them, I was told they were in their "call tray".  They are terribly understaffed, always have to wait forever to get any service but they are nice.  If you are looking for decent quality & variety of frames and want prompt service - do yourself a favor and go elsewhere!!!
