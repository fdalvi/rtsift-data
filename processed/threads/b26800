2 The entire staff does not speak English enough to relate comfortably with them about what you want done.  Happily they are not talking constantly to each other like the shop I tried last time...Envy Nails...the conversation there was constant, personal and loud.... This shop does not use liners in their pedi basins...I thought it was a law but whether it is or not, I like that feature.  Their utensils do not look clean.  Like another review said....everything cost extra and my callus's were not even slightly removed and I get Pedi's every 2 weeks.  Guess I will have to go a little further to my old salon, Highland nails....Andy gives a great pedi.  Hardly ever does a shop take AMEX...and neither does this one
2 LAZY--- I've been here a few times when I was in a hurry only because the place I really like is busy. They never do a fully good job. They always rush thru the job. Skip a step or forget.  Like today I went for a mani/pedi. I had to ask the guy to file my nails after he brushed the nail file over them once leaving them uneven. REALLY!! I know he can see. Then he only cut have of my cuticles. Got up and forgot when he came back. When I asked him to do it of course I looked like the bad guy.  Same with the manicure the lady gave me and the last time was just as bad. Uneven nails they don't clean underneath the nails and just walk away. No thank you nothing. I will never go back. I know now to always make an appt at the place I like
1 Horrible, got the most painful fill of my life!! Super glue under nails, sore around cuticles
