3 I found quite a few things that I liked here. But, I just wasn't able to find the help that I needed to purchase them. So, I went about my shopping and got no help. I wanted to try on a few items but wasn't able to score a fitting room. I was not at all impressed. The mens' dress items weren't great but they were priced a lil better than I had expected. Still, the lack of customer appreciation was disappointing and upsetting even. I am tired of being ignored like I was invisible.
3 KC was having a pretty good sale. I ended buying a dress that was originally $100, marked down to $80, then $40. During this sale, everything in the store was an additional 50% off. So, got a one sleeve, black slinky dress for $22!  Cashiers were friendly and the associates were helpful. The store was crazy and there was merchandise everywhere. It was looking for boots but it was too chaotic to find matching pairs.
3 This is a premium brand with equally premium prices. The leather bags cost more than Coach and Dooney at times .I saw a sale once; the bag price was $79.00 but that was short-lived. The shoes, although in a neatly organized section, was also pricey. I did spot the lower end of the Kenneth Cole brand, Unlisted, wallets for $14.99 that looked tempting but I didn't bite.   With my experience in browsing, we simply do not go here much. But this store is good if you are a fan of the brand and would like to pay lower prices.
4 Friendly staff, clean store, very comfortable women's shoes and great deals. Got a $60 soft shirt for $20! Women's pumps are super comfy. Sales staff there to help as well if you need it.
