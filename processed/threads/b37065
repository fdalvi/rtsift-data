5 The best place to watch the sunset in Mesa. Just beautiful, great service, food, and drinks. Sometimes they have live music on the weekends too. I have to check out their breakfast as well.
2 Generally speaking if a place has good food and bad service I will overlook the bad service. Well this place has terrible service and very mediocre food. The view is nice and the queso is good. Beyond that there is nothing worth going here for. A suggestion I have for The Patio is better more attentive, happy waitresses. I can go anywhere in the valley and get a dose of attitude from 20 year old girls for FREE. I prefer my lunch attitude free. Another suggestion I have is if there is mostly sandwiches to eat here add something besides salad for people who eat gluten free even if its just corn tortillas. I would and could overlook the bland food if I felt like the staff genuinely cared when they ask how is your lunch. Muttering "enjoy" and then perking up when you bring the bill will not your saving grace to obtain a tip.
1 Horrible food and service.. We went there for valentines day and my BFF birthday .. Food was cold, and serving people has no idea... They need a new management ....Went there twice will never go again !!!!!!
