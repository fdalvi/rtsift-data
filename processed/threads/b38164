5 After moving to Arizona, I was having horrible acne that I haven't had in years. I met with multiple places and had no luck. Luminescence in Chandler, AZ knew exactly what steps to take to help. They are very informative, experienced in the various procedures, products, and overall skin care. Nicole and Tammy are great to work with and make you feel comfortable no matter what procedure you are having done.
5 I've been following Tammy around for years (since 2007!) and she is truly the key to beautiful skin. She must be since hers looks like porcelain.   I wouldn't go anywhere else for ANYTHING skin related.  Did I mention I drive from North Phoenix just to go there?
5 I bought a groupon for Luminescence for laser hair removal.  I am half way through my treatment and I am so pleased.  The Spa is so professional and clean!!  I tried to do my research comparing them to other spas and now I understand why they have the best reviews.  They have been great with scheduling and I really feel like they go the extra mile to make me feel comfortable since this has been a new experience for me.  I have recommended them to many of my family and friends and will continue to do so!  Thanks Luminescence!
5 I absolutely love Luminescence!  Tammy is amazing and really makes you feel comfortable no matter what you are getting done.  The laser hair removal treatments are super affordable and work so well that I just signed up for another round of treatments in a different area.  I am looking forward to continuing to go here for a long time, and am so happy with each and every one of my experiences there. I have already referred my best friend and she loves it too!
5 Came here for underarms laser treatment and love Tammy and the whole staff and the cool laser they use makes it almost painless! Highly recommend! Beautiful and clean new office location also is a plus!
