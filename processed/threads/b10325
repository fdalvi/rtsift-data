3 Dr Ohriner is great. He has a matter of fact attitude with a touch of sarcasm which I appreciate. I'd give the office 4 stars if it wasn't for the wait time in reception.
5 I have been going to dr . O for years . The man is one of a kind and the only eye doctor I trust . He is funny and very knowledgable about vision . I actually have fun going to the eye doctor . He is a great guy and very professional
1 Absolutely horrible!! If I could give them Zero Stars I would.  I took my daughter in for an appointment and it took two and a half hours!! We would have left had they not been sure to collect our co-pay upfront.  The staff was so inept that I knew it would never be refunded to us.  I had to go to work so my husband had to drive down and relieve me.  They actually locked them into the office and left them there while the staff left.  There is no reason to ever be this unprofessional!!
