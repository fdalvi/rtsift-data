4 2/20/2011 - They were great today. My online order was wrong - they made another pizza, delivered it to my house, and took the wrong one to give to charity
1 Called in a "to go" Crazy Cheesy Crust large pizza with Sausage and mushroom at 5:50 PM.  Was told order would be ready to pick up in 15 minutes (pick up at 6:05 PM). Sat in the lobby and was given pizza at 6:30 PM.  Was so pissed off that I did not look at the pizza.  When I got home, there was a profound lack of toppings.  My wife told me not to grouse about it and that we ordered from this place to try it.  We finished half the pizza when she suggested I write a review.  I took a picture of the remaining slices as proof. Absolutely amazing these guys are in business.  If you use this location: (1) Add 15 minutes to the pick-up time they tell you. (2) Expect skimpy toppings  Other than that, the place is fine.
3 Waiting time longer than they said and the staff member who took our order came off very rude. The pizza isn't bad, but after waiting ~30 minutes and being talked down to by an exasperated and unfriendly staff member I wasn't in the mood for pizza anymore.
