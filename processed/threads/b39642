5 A fantastic shop with a great range of well set-out stock.    Good range of bikes and staff that are willing, patient and able to talk through your requirements and help find what you need; will encourage you to take a bike out for a test.    The range of accessories is great, and they have stuff that you didn't even know you needed (by that I mean new shiny things that you just want).    They also provide bike maintenance and run maintenance courses.
5 The bike co-op sale is great and its worth waiting for this twice yearly event. The have a great range of bikes and the service department is really helpful. We're on bike 5 and still love going into the shop.
5 Brilliant, well stocked shop with knowledgeable, helpful and friendly staff who are proactive about helping you out, and provide fantastic advice to help you with your decision -- whether its buying a new bike or just a new pump or spanner!    They also have a brilliant website, so you can research what you're looking for before you head into the store.    My favourite bike store by far.
