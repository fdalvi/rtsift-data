5 Huge Selection of quality patio furniture at unbeatable prices!
2 Ordered the 12 piece La Jolla set in silver and canvas. Received the furniture, looks great in our rooftop terrace. No issues with the delivery BUT the reason why I am giving this company 2 stars is that there was a chair cushion missing from the set delivered. Ok, that is fair enough things can get lost or go missing however when I contacted the company their interest level was down to zero. Pretty much we got your money thank you very much. I contacted the guy to advise we will need a replacement cushion and he was quite defensive we take photos to ensure all pieces are sent blah blah. I said that is fine we can pay for the replacement if need be. The guy asked me then to send him an email detailing the cushion etc which was more than 2 weeks ago and I have heard nothing! So here you go 2 stars for the customer service you will receive!
5 Very, very pleased with both the quality of the product and the customer service. Would definitely recommend this as a well-priced alternative to the other more expensive look-a-like product on the market.  Thank you for making our patio look spectacular!
