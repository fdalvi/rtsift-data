1 This seemingly is JUST for the home--not for people's clothes. I thought it was a JoAnn's competitor.  Bolts and bolts of fabric on hanging rolls. Also carpets. No one said hello or offered to help us. No patterns here. They have designer fabric but i didnt check the labels.
5 I love Home Fabrics! The staff has always been very helpful and cheerful whenever I have been there. They have GREAT prices on decorator fabric, trims, foam, etc. They offer free workshops on how to do drapes, etc. on Saturday mornings that I just found out about and I am very excited to go learn. They are strictly a home furnishings type of fabric store but probably should be your first stop if that's what you are looking for.
1 It's always such a letdown when you go into a store that could be great, but isn't. Samantha the manager is so unprofessional, incompetent, & clueless. How does she have that job??? Maybe it's a family business or they aren't really interested in making money. Crazy. Taking  my business elsewhere.
5 I just had some windows installed for my new house and you know what they need?  Curtains!  I've searched high and low for just the right curtains that compliment my freshly painted walls.  I have had no luck.  The problem is that all the stores seem to have the same style.  I need something different and unique like Monique.    Home Fabrics has a great selection of fabric that got me excited!  Luckily, I have a sewing machine and curtains are the easiest thing to make.  My search for curtains ended here!
