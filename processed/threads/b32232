5 A medical practice that has a "Heart".. Very caring , attentative, and they "LISTEN"....I ALWAYS feel relaxed here...They will take care of you !
5 Dr. Calderon and his staff are the best. They always go out of their way to help you and make you feel good.
5 First off, I would like to make sure that you, the reader is aware that they have moved to a new location. I have messaged Yelp several times about the new address but looks like they havnt gotten around to it yet.   The new address is 2810 West Charleston Blvd. Building F. Suite 53.  This new office is twice as big with more chairs and some tables with magazines. Parking is about the same. It's not a lot, but enough for you to find a spot for you not to walk so far.  I like going here because of the two doctors I see. One being Dr Calderon who is my primary care doctor. The other just recently is my cardiologist Dr Aquino. Both are nice and tend to my needs accordingly. The typical wait for my appointments here don't take half the day just like my last unnamed primary care doctor.   The receptionist and medical assistants do an awesome job of getting my paperwork processed and make sure I have everything filled out correctly.   In closing, if you are fed up with your primary care doctor and hate taking a day off from work just to fulfill an appointment, come here. They will take good care of you.
