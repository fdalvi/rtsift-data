5 First time trying this salon and I was highly impressed! Stylists and staff were extremely friendly and took there time making sure my children came out looking beautiful! I have 4 children age 7 and under and they had iPad games, movies, and toys to keep them all entertained while waiting for there turn. They have a frequent visit card where your 10th cut is free and they do little girl makeovers with makeup, hairstyle, etc that would be great for any little princesses birthday party or special event!  We will definitely be back!
5 Such a fun salon for kids. Our stylist Mira was so nice, patient and friendly.  We are definitely come here from now on.
5 I took my son here for his first hair cut and the staff was amazing!! They took great care of him and did everything to keep him distracted during his cut!  They have a tv playing a movie so the child can watch while they get their hair cut and even go so far to ask what their favorite movie is, and will change it to make sure the child is enjoying their experience! I will definitely be going back!
