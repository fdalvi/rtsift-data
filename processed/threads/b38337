4 I was lucky enough to stumble upon the new Le Creuset Signature store at the Scottsdale Quarter. I own a few of the cast iron pieces and absolutely love them! My pieces makes cooking enjoyable for me and clean up incredibly easy. The store itself has an array of bright, beautiful signature colors.  I found the staff to be inviting, knowledgeable and truly proud of their brand.  I am excited to have a Le Creuset store is close by and will be one of their regular customers!
5 Le Creuset has a great new location in the Scottsdale Quarter.  The signature store has a complete line of cast iron, kitchen tools, stainless steel, wine accessories and stoneware.  Next time you are in the area check out the cooking demonstrations on Saturdays.
5 WARNING: This is NOT your average cooking store! Le Creuset at Scottsdale Quarter is more like a "Gallery of Fine Cookware" - from the contemporary design of the store and displays, to the renown, colorful Cast Iron works of art. Their staff is friendly, professional and very knowledgable. I went in for a new spatula after they opened about a year ago, and now I'm hooked! I have replaced just about everything in my kitchen with Le Creuset. I highly recommend this store and everything in it :)
