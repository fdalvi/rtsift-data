4 Carl's Jr is may favorite fast food burger, it has a good grill flavor not like BK which to me taste like liquid smoke.  They have a hearty low carb burger that taste great and fills me up.       They also have interesting featured burgers . The staff brings the food to you when dining in and clears your tray when your done , they always check to see if everything alright.
4 Growing up in San Diego in the 1970's meant Mickey D's, Jacks, BK, KY Fry, DW, and if I was good, Carl's Jr.  A Super Star with Cheese, Criss-Cut Fries and a drink was a treat.  It still is.  With all the choices in fast food burgers, Carl's is still one of the chains at the top of my list.  As a matter of fact, I think it sounds good for dinner tonight on my way to DeMolay.
3 Just finished the 2 for $4.00 Famous Star special.   The hamburgers were average, with a nice grilled flavor.   The Spicy Chicken sandwich is also average.   Generally, I find that Carl's Jr is expensive so look for coupons.
