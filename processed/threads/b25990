5 OK. Mad. I had a book written. Amazing, thorough and well deserved. I posted and it didn't save. Sorry Minister Dave, Yusuf and Simple Weddings.   Simple Weddings is AMAZING, they went above and beyond from the start to the very very end and is crazy affordable. You made our simple, special occasion amazing and I will remember you always.   We will be back to re-new our vows.  THANK YOU THANK YOU!  If you want a great experience and great pictures....call them and book now. You won't regret it.  Love you guys!!!!!
5 Fun! HIGHLY recommend them to anyone getting married in Vegas, regardless of your wedding style: wacky Elvis or Hangover theme or romantic in Ceasar's Palace Garden.  The Reverend is funny but still performed an intimate and special ceremony. Amazing photographer! Their customer service is also top notch and easy to work with them.Especially recommend for people who live out of state. They are pros and make it easy and fun! The Reverend did a great job entertaining our group of 12 while we took photos.  Had a wonderful experience and know you will too!
5 Minster Richard & Melinda were our wedding day saviors after I missed my own wedding:( It seemed if anything and everything that could go wrong that day it did and I was about to break down into tears when we spotted the silver lighting of the one and only "Simple Vegas Wedding Chapel".  Melinda set the scene and Minister Richard made the moment all the more memorable by making us laugh and cry throughout the ceremony. They surprised us with our first dance as husband and wife. To make it even more perfect we danced to the song I wanted to sing to my Husband on our wedding day by coincidence;) To top it off we were low on funds and being the compassionate people they are we worked it out with ease. We were married for $70 and I couldn't have been more pleased because in that moment it was as if everything was "Ment to be" when I heard my fianc√© say,"I Do". God bless such wonderful people as they are sincerely there for you on your big day!                                            -Mr. & Mrs. Sawyer
5 Awesome company to have officiate at your wedding.  It truly was a SIMPLE process.  Scheduled the entire wedding via text messaging & purchased the deal thru Yelp. Minister David was prompt, professional, friendly and quick.  They didn't even jack up the prices on the day of our wedding which was on 11-12-13, considered a "special occasion" day by some other service companies.  We highly recommend Simple Vegas Weddings!  Thanks.
