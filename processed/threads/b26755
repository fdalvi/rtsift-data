5 After a horrible experience at Metro PCS, I went through the drive through to get some lunch on the fly.  5 stars for the cheerful and efficient gal at the drive thru window. The food is always consistently good.
5 The food was delicious and tasted very fresh considering it was after lunch time
2 My orange chicken was dry like it had been sitting there for a while. My noodles were almost cold. Never going back. Yuck, I wish I had gone to firehouse subs instead.
