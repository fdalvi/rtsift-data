4 This place is a bit too modern and clean to be considered an authentic St Louis style BBQ establishment, however, the food is a nice surprise to stumble across way out here in the desert.  The Brisket is amazing, although, some may say it's just a tad over priced for BBQ, but worth it in my opinion.  There's another location in Mesa on Alma School just south of the 60.
5 This is some of the best BBQ I've ever had. Pulled pork is incredible. Big portions of food at great prices. Fast service. A great place to hang out and have some drinks as well.
4 I ate here once w hubby after we wandered around Whole Foods next door...I was starting to get cranky and nasty. Hubby knew it was time for me to be fed.  I was hungry and completely demolished my plate. I don't even remember what I ordered. It was rumored to be brisket, but I was so hungry I didn't check twice. I left with a happy belly. Food tasted good, but the overall impression of the place was, "It's not that big, it's clean enough and the portions were pretty big."  I became a fan, but hubby said his food wasn't so good and had no desire to come back and give them a second chance. Boo. :( Pity because we live so close to them.
