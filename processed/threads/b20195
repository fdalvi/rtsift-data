4 Old traditional bar which has been around for a long time.    It tends to attract a slightly older crowd, who are much more interested in having good conversation than posing in an expensive George Street bar.    There's a coal fire in the winter, which is just the thing for thawing you out when you come in from the cold.
3 Mathers is a bit of a spit and sawdust kind of establishment at the top of Broughton Street, the kind of place where you could probably actually get away with gobbing on the floor if you so desired. Its clientele look like the kind of guys who are qualified to use pneumatic drills, this is most definitely a bloke's pub and tends to be full of proper blokes on any given evening. I wouldn't come here on my own for a quiet drink, but the boyfriend and I have been in together on a few occasions to take advantage of their extensive and reasonably priced range of single malts. They show most major sporting events on their TVs, although I'd advise you get there early to grab a drink and somewhere to stand - it can get pretty mobbed.
3 Emma had it spot on, Bar Bruiser.   I've never felt less manly in my whole life. Everyone in here used to be a boxer/kick-boxer and have a 3 course meal of nails and barbed wire for dinner. They don't really make any noise or have anything to say until someone scores a goal, which then becomes the hot topic of conversation all week.   Staff are very nice though and the place is comfy.
4 This is a good, traditional pub which, as the decor informs you, has been around for a long time.  It feels friendly inside with a clean, impressive, wooden bar and plenty of top quality spirits behind it.  Malt whiskey is its speciality and it has a great, but also expensive, selection.  Pints are reasonably priced at about Â£3 each and they sell good quality, real ales and beers alongside the standard Tennents and Strongbow.   Mathers also has plamsa TV screens which are always showing the latest football, rugby or boxing matches.  Naturally, this attracts a good bunch of 'lads', but on any given nights there's a good range of people, including locals and students.
3 Pretty much what it says on the tin, an old geezers spit n sawdust pub. I like it!
