3 I frequent this particular Subway for a variety of different reasons.  For starters, I work at the Arizona Center, so its right in my area for a quick lunch when I am starving.  I'm not a fan of Subway's in general.  I don't think thier food is that good, and I've found other alternatives to them to eat healthy if I choose.  There is usually quite a line when you walk in, only because a lot of us take lunch hour at the same times here. The location is usually neat and clean, and the staff here is okay at best.  Menu is self explanitory, and seating is ample, inside or out.
2 This is the most understaffed Subway in Phx.  There is no doubt in my mind that it will easily take me 20 minutes to get in and out of this Subway.  The problem with that is that I am usually trying to catch a movie.  It really gets frustrating to watch one person do all three parts of the job alone while some kid sits in the back and acts like they are busy.    All of that being said, this Subway is consistent and usually tastes good.  The place is always clean and the workers TRY to move you through as fast as possible.
1 I'm in town for a convention and decided to grab a Sub to take back to the hotel room.  This Subway has a great location in the Arizona Center.  It was not very busy.  The staff was friendly and neat.   I was disappointed when I got back to the room to eat only to discover that the bread either old or left in the microwave to long.
2 This Subway is in the Arizona Center in downtown Phoenix.  I have eaten at this particular restaurant several times and it was just regular old Subway.  There are so many better choices near by for sandwiches,  I can't seem to understand how this place can be so busy.  Subway claims to want to offer better health choices for customers, yet they regularly offer "footlong" subs that are marginally more expensive than a 6-inch sandwich.  If you are looking for a decent sandwich in the area, head over to Crave (my favorite) or corner bakery.
