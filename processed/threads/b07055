1 My husband and I used to LOVE this place!!  My husband is really good with cars, but he couldn't do anything because we lived in an apartment with street parking.  We took a car in to get the fuel lines replaced.  They decided to PATCH them instead...they leaked right away and we needed another tow.  I took my 94 toyota camry V6 to them to get the muffler fixed (the whole thing got pulled off).  A few years later, we are now putting a new one on (because it split down the whole side).  They had manipulated the whole system to fit a generic (not the right camry muffler) on...  I have lists of other things that have gone wrong. Needless to say, we are no longer going to them.  I'm just so disappointed.  They used to be great.  Not sure what changed/happened, but they are not trust-worthy.
5 I love McDermotts. I go to them for everything, and every time I've had them fix something, it stays fixed. I have a junky old car (13+ years), and they've kept it on the road for the last 2.5 years.
5 They are good!  The only limitation seems to be what you are allowing them to fix.  i recently purchased a 20 yr old Taurus which they have maintained for many years.  Any additional requests have been completed to my complete satisfaction.  This old (collector) car will last for many more trips.  Good value!
4 I've gone here twice now. Once for a seatbelt problem and just yesterday for a dashboard light replacement and tire and rim replacement.  Cons: * Had to call them a couple times to figure out the status of my car and when it was ready. To be fair, they seemed like they may have had a lot of work that day, but I expect a auto repair shop to be more proactive in letting me know when my car is ready. * They also didn't give tell me how much the bill would end up being in advance which Meineke, by contrast, does before starting work.   Pros: * Cheaper than taking it to Meineke which is where I usually go. * Repairs done to my satisfaction. * Friendly service. If you need a ride somewhere close, they'll take you there for free. Feels more like a small, family business.  If you're on the west side, I'd definitely recommend them and plan to go there again.
