1 The reason I'm giving 1 star is because I must in order to give a review. My nephew was basically kicked out because of the incompetency & non existent communication of this facility. This was my nephew's first formal schooling experience, which he loved right up to the point when we had to break his heart & inform him he would no longer attend. My little love started a month ago with 3 other little boys that we were told only about 4 months into the program. My nephew was basically kicked out because he can't properly hold a pencil....ridiculous right?? Well that's what they told us. He doesn't have a dominant hand which we love because if he can use both hands then great!! Another point that was never discussed was the fact that he might get a trial period to see where he was at...which seems appropriate but not a month into it. Then they had the nerve to say that the tuition is non-refundable...yet only the deposit is stated in the paperwork that is non-refundable. The whole point of school is obviously so kids can learn & put to practice those new learned skills. I hate to say that they discriminated him but if it looks, talks & feels like a duck....then guess what?? It's a duck!
5 My child is currently enrolled in Summerlin Kinder Prep.  I am very happy with the curriculum, the environment and especially the teacher and staff. My older child attended Summerlin Kinder Prep last year.  I was very please with how well my child did, she was well prepared for kindergarten.  I am not only pleased that my children have received almost one on one attention, they have also excelled in reading and writing.  After looking into a few different preschools, I am very glad that my children had the opportunity to attend Summerlin Kinder Prep.  Tuition was very affordable and they are centrally located.
5 My daughter has been enrolled in Summerlin Kinder Prep for almost 6 months now.  I have been very happy with our experience here.  Miss Sarah is a great teacher and my daughter loves her.  I appreciate the small class size and the structured time she has during her mornings there.  She looks forward to going everyday and has been learning a lot, preparing her for kindergarten.  I have no complaints, everything runs very smoothly and organized.  I can easily communicate with either her teacher (Miss Sarah), or the Administrator Tracy at any time.  Overall Great Preschool and greatly appreciated!!
5 Our son has attended this preschool and just graduated today. He loved it, and had made good friends with his classmates. He loves his teacher, Ms. Sarah, and always looked forward to taking something to show-and-tell. His overall experience, I think, had been a pleasant one for him.  I like how there are only few students per class so Ms. Sarah was able to pay good attention to what her students needed to learn and at what pace. Our son learned a lot of things he needed to learn before Kindergarten (colors, numbers, letters, days of the week, reading, etc) so we are really satisfied that we sent him to this school.  Ms. Tanya takes over the admin side of things, and she's been really friendly and helpful. I liked how when she reminded us of public school registration date because I wasn't aware of it.   They also had a field trip and our son had fun with it. We celebrated holidays throughout the school year with food contributions which I liked because it made our son aware of what they were going to celebrate in school.  Graduation today was a blast! For a little school, it was really really well prepared and decorated. The children performed magnificently. It was short and sweet, too, so the kids didn't get cranky.   I recommend this school to anyone looking for a preschool.
5 I couldn't be happier with making the choice of enrolling my daughter here! Not only did she enjoyed going to school, but she learned so much! I love that they have a small class size, my daughter was able to learn more on a one on one basis. They did a lot of reading and writing and even had a field trip to spring preserve. Ms. Sarah and Tanya both were amazing! The day my daughter graduated she was so upset that she was not longer was going to attend! They did an excellent job and I would never hesitate to recommend this school to anyone!
