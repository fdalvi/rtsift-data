1 If I could give this company a zero I would.  The business manager "Mike"  is completely unprofessional and incompitent.  On top of that he smells like smoke. Have another cigarette.
5 All I can say is what a great and helpful company. The entire team is efficient and made my experience fast and enjoyable. Everyone I spoke with in the company was friendly and I would definitely use their company again! Thanks again, Olga!
5 Synrg was great to work with.  Helped me a ton with starting my own hair buisness.  Would definitely recommend!
5 I use SYNRG for my business social media needs so that I can focus on taking care of customers and operating my business. I have been extremely pleased with the results. They are responsive, professional and understand my needs in the way I conduct business. I feel like Olga is part of our business. They also offer a wide variety of other services and are presently working on some program design for us to implement. Highly recommend!
5 I've been a client at SYNRG for the past 60+ days and I'm pleased with the results so far. Olga is very responsive when I call her and extremely attentive to the social media needs of my insurance agency. Her posts are very creative and professional which enhance our image and credibility. She is an extension of our insurance agency in many ways helping us to extend our reach through social media. I would definitely recommend Olga and SYNRG.
