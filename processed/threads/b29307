3 it was "meet the real L word" night and a bunch of us decided to check it out.  never really did see any members of the show.   2 dj's and 2 mediocre gogo-dancers shaking their ass.  our drunk friends were having a blast, even played "spin-the-bottle" with a complete stranger just cause it was her birthday.  hahahha  it's not exactly by the strip even though the address is "las vegas blvd" the cab ride back to our hotel cost $17+tip.   over all, a fun lesbo bar!
4 Had a good time here & I would come back based on my one exerience alone  Good music/VERY strong drinks with a full bar & a kick ass dj  They have go-go dancers all night in case your not into dancing & just want to enjoy the show   Had major fun there with my gf & would do it all again on any night  Keep the drinks coming!
5 I've got to say Bootybar is the best lesbian nightclub in Vegas!! The DJs are awesome, Lisa & Carla and sexy too! Drinks are  strong, and good prices ... especially for how nice the venue is. Dive bar prices with awesome ambiance! Bootybar is only every other week so it always a night to look forward too! The locals come together & always new faces @bootybar!
5 A big group of us girlies went to Vegas for New Years and went the evening of New Years day. WHAT A PARTY! We had VIP, and were truely treated like it. Great service, great drinks, great music, and a fabulous crowd! Even the bathrooms were clean, well kept and had an attendant. The vibe was great, the music was great and we met some wonderful people here. Will def go back when visiting Vegas......keep this going!
4 I just moved to vegas and I HAD A BLAST!!!   great DRINKS HoT GIRLS FLY ASS scene LOVED IT!!!!!  I'll be coming back again again and again
