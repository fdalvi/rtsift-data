5 We took a sunrise flight with Doug and his crew.  This is a family business and it makes for a fun experience.  It is beautiful to fly with sites like Red Rocks and the mountains one direction and the strip and the desert floor the other.  I would highly recommend this flight.  From the early morning lift off to the champagne toast afterwards!!
5 We had such an unbelievable experience, thanks to the amazing pilot and crew at Las Vegas Balloon Rides!!  I highly recommend doing this while you're in town.  They were so great!
5 The balloon ride was great.  I took my two kids (7 and 11) and they both loved it.  I loved the fact there were discount children rates! Doug the Captain has decades of experience with a flawless safety record.  We got fantastic views of the Red Rock mountain area.  The take off and landing were both super smooth and we got a full hot breakfast after the ride.
5 well i'm not really an expert on hot air balloon rides, i've never landed in one, but from what i know, the first half of the ride has always been great with the dougs.  Doug Sr. and Doug Jr are both accomplished pilots and have never failed to explain whats going on during set up or the flight itself.  one of the neat things about flying with the Dougs is that you are likely to encounter skydivers at some point if you fly with them more than once. i think its a great way for sane grounded rational people to interact with some other sane grounded not so rational people.  kind of a nice way to mix things up a bit.  i'd like to say the landings are great and silky smooth, but i have a habit of jumping out of the balloon at the halfway point so all i can say is that they look like theyre great and silky smooth.  i can say i've never heard of anyone complaining about the landings.  so, yup, a positive experience all around.  they'll even throw in breakfast for special occasions and such, but i tend not to stick around. all i can really say is that  i look forward to the next time i fly with the dougs, cause it's always an adventure
4 Definitely a bucket list kinda thang!!!   BF and I wanted to do something different and something we've both never done before.... I saw this deal on Amazon Local and figured that's COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from all the hype that is Las Vegas.   Although we started way early for my liking, it was a pretty dope experience!  From watching them inflate a hot air ballon that came outta a family van, to being 1300 feet above ground, to watching them deflate the hot air.... It was something we'll both never forget!    Please take note: I'm scared of heights and didn't look down once. But, it was amazing. And didn't even feel shaky at all. Felt like we were on solid ground.
5 Doug and his crew are knowledgeable and very friendly. Great balloon ride, nice hot breakfast afterward. Would recommend to anyone!
5 Wonderful experience!              My Husband and I surprised my folks with a sunrise hot air balloon ride for their anniversary. We took advantage of their Living Social offer. I trusted this company based off previous happy yelpers, and was thankful it was even more wonderful than I had expected!!!! Communication with Doug is flawless, he always answered his phone and was happy to help with any questions or requests to help surprise my parents. Meet up and pick up went smooth. The ride was amazing! Doug is full of personality and helps you feel comfortable the entire time! There were 6 passengers in our ride and everyone enjoyed every second! The take off and landing were smooth, they don't expect you to do any work or clean up once you land. We enjoyed a (non alcoholic) champagne toast after the ride. Breakfast was hot and tasty.... eggs, bacon, toast, and pancakes...... nothing fancy but much better than I expected!!!! The balloon ride is calm and peaceful, experience it with someone important to you and you wont be disappointed! Wonderful way to start your day!!!!
5 I wanted to surprise my boyfriend with a hot air balloon ride for his birthday weekend in Vegas. He had no idea what we were doing up at 5 in the morning, but once Doug came with his van I think he became rather excited. It was a pleasure to do business with Doug, as other people said, there was no problem with communication with Doug. He told us he would pick us up at the Cosmopolitan at 5:45am but when it was 10 min after I called to make sure everything was okay and he apologized and said he would be there in 3 min. Sure enough he arrived 3 minutes later.   We were driven to a bar/restaurant to get some papers signed, after that he brought us to the take off location where we watched them unfold and set up the balloon, and blow it up! It was such a cool experience! Getting into the basket was fun but it was a bit rocky and unstable. Going up into the air was a rush. I had been skydiving before but this was a different experience considering we were going up slowly and watching the ground level decrease beneath us. Another thing to be aware of is, it is necessary to keep the fire pumping throughout the entire trip and the heat from the fire is pretty hot. At some points I felt like my head and face was on fire. Once we landed, Doug brought out some non-alcoholic champagne and orange juice for us to toast to a completed trip. We were driven back to the bar/restaurant and given a complimentary breakfast while watching a slideshow of pictures from our trip.  Throughout the entire experience we had a great time because Doug was full of jokes and we felt very comfortable. We enjoyed learning about hot air ballooning and him and his family's history with hot air balloons. The best part was watching Doug's son and his friend base jump/sky dive off the side of the hot air balloon basket!   This is a family owned business and there was a lot of teamwork involved. I was thoroughly impressed with how well everybody worked together. They definitely knew what they were doing and were very professional in all aspects. THIS IS THE COMPANY TO GO TO EVERYBODY! I remember I had trouble figuring out which hot air balloon company would be the best considering there are a few others but I am extremely happy this is the one I ended up going through with. The other company "Vegas Balloon Rides" came later and kind of 'took' Doug's company name. Doug has been around for longer than anybody out there. He knows what he is doing!  Everybody should try this at least once in their life! and definitely go with Las Vegas Balloon Rides!
1 Not impressed at all. I paid 200 to go up and see the top of my house.  We traveled from Post and Ft Apache to Windmill and Durango.  I wish someone had warned me of where the flight would go. The pilot/owner spent 1/2 the time telling jokes, which was good. Unfortunately, the other 1/2 was spent bad mouthing the competitor.  That's not enjoyable.  And talk about HOT.  You need a hat... NEED!  They should set better expectations, an email covering what to bring doesn't cost anything and is just good customer service.  We almost landed on private property, the landing team had to help the basket get over gate.  There were 13 total on the trip including the pilot. It might be legal, but for a comfortable experience, it should be limited to 9. You get handed a disclosure on a lanyard which says tipping the pilot is customary.  umm its not customary to tip the owner.  Speaking of which, four of us on the ride were told that if they wanted an extra 30 minutes, they could pay an extra 50 in cash.  umm yet again. On the good side, you don't feel anything when up in the air. Also good, the pilot has a lot of flight experience and the crew is polite.
5 I surprised my skydiving husband with a balloon ride/jump for his birthday.  It was amazing!  He got to jump out of the balloon with his other skydiving friends.  It gave the other passengers an added treat to watch 6 people jump out of our balloon (not at the same time).  The staff are nice and have a good time doing what they do.  They make the experience fun.  I definitely recommend this company.  They are the only one in the valley with a perfect safety record.    I also recently sent my father-in-law and my hubby for a balloon ride with this company while he was visiting us.  I can't wait to go again!
5 Almost every weekend I see a group of balloons floating around near the hills on the southwest side of town.I thought I should jump at the chance to see the city from high in the sky. I have gone on a balloon ride twice before so I knew what to expect when I booked the ride.  *I would suggest booking a flight when the weather is cool- spring or fall. *Be flexible with the dates that you can fly- the weather here in the desert in very unpredictable. Too much heat or wind is not a good thing when flying.  *Wear comfy clothes and shoes.  *Dress in layers. Its a bit cool when you take off, but once the sun rises, you will heat up. * Most importantly... WEAR A HAT!   The pilot and crew were very positive and professional. I felt safe the entire flight. We hovered around the south west side of town near Fort Apache/Wet and Wild area. After the flight we were served non alcoholic champagne and then taken to a local establishment for a hearty breakfast- a reward for getting up so early.  LVBR were proud of their business and were invested in each passenger having a safe and memorable experience.
4 I bought an Amazon Local deal to take my girlfriend on a hot air balloon ride for her birthday back in September.  The weather foiled our plan a few times, and I started to get skeptical, but after the light breeze we had for today's ride, I totally understand why anything stronger for wind is unsafe.  The flight itself was great and, all around, a really cool experience - a bucket list item, as many have said.  We took off around 7:30am, flew for about an hour, and went to Denny's for breakfast after a champagne toast upon landing.  The balloon was a little packed (we had 12 passengers on our flight), but it wasn't horrible - kinda' like riding public transportation.  I'm 6'4", so the 55,000+ BTU flame throwers overhead were a little uncomfortable at times, but overall we both enjoyed it a lot!  Doug has a lot of experience, told some funny jokes along the way, and gave us thorough briefings to prepare us for the ride.  The staff was all friendly, and we got some amazing views around the valley.  Thanks, Las Vegas Balloon Rides!
5 I'm so glad I found Las Vegas Balloon Rides when my girlfriend and I visited Vegas last week. It was our 10 year anniversary so I wanted it to be special. Let me just say that Doug (owner and pilot) was very helpful through the whole process - nice, funny, and accommodating (helped mount my GoPro on the balloon) from the phone call to the day of.    The ride itself was serene and breathtaking. It's hard to explain what it feels like to be in a hot air balloon. I expected it to be unstable when I saw it up close given the fact that you're standing in a wooden basket attached to a huge piece of cloth(!), but it was nothing of the sort. Smooth sailing the whole time - you don't even realize you're in the air until you look straight down, and even then it's more awe than fear.   LV Balloon Rides gave us the best price in the city, and with it we got a pilot who has been in the business for 30+ years (at least). I recommend it wholeheartedly.
