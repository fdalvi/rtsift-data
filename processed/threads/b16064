5 I saw Stephanie for skin rash (an allergic reaction from brand new wool sweater) on both of my forearms. Went to 2 different dermatologies and they just gave a steroid creams that didn't work ( used it for 2 weeks) before I decided to give acupuncture a try. After just one treatment the skin rash started going away and after the 2nd treatment the rash were all gone. I also refer Stephanie to our Lymphedema patients from Lymphatic Therapy Services for different types of problems like salivary gland not producing saliva, chronic pain and more...and we always get positive feedback. Thanks you so much Stephanie for all you help.
5 Dr. Jordan is amazing! She truly listens to what your areas of concern are and addresses them. I usually suffer from incredible migraines and semi-permanent acupuncture needless took the pain away and kept it away. Much cheaper than all the specialists who haven't been able to help in the slightest.
5 I started seeing Dr. Stephanie Jordan in 2004 for a variety of low-grade issues: heartburn, headaches, mid-afternoon energy crashes, lethargy, brain fog, moodiness, painful periods and all the physical aches and pains I garnered from my work at the time as a massage therapist. She helped explain my various maladies in easy-to-understand TCM terms. Over the years I have continued to see her and I can confidently say that she changed my life. As my doctor, health coach, and acupuncturist, Dr. Jordan put me on an herbal medicine regimen, educated me about nutrition, and helped me to prioritize my health issues - and held me accountable for doing my own part. It is because of Dr. Jordan that I have been able to do make all those changes that have allowed me to be much more productive than I had ever hoped. Truly, I am not sure where I would be now without her.
