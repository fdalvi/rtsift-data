5 I've been doing business with these guys since the late 80's.  They've always had the best service and fairest prices of anyone else in town.  Nobody adjusts or regrips my clubs but the guys at Vegas Golf.
5 Great place!! You will find a good deal though Bill Ahlert. He is very helpful. Make sure bring CASH because they will give u discount if u use cash on some the item.
5 Went in to have my clubs re-gripped.  Salesman was helpful and worked with me to achieve what I was looking for.  Overall I was very happy with the fit and price of my clubs and it only took them about 2 hours to do my irons.  Going to be taking my wedges in soon to have them matched.  Support local business!
5 Always get great service at Vegas Golf. I've had clubs re-gripped, re-shafted, and shortened. Every time I've been very satisfied.  Lots of good deals in the store too if you're looking for to replace a club.   Highly recommend.
5 quality products exactly as described. best packaging ive ever received a club in, better then ordering direct from a manufacturer!
