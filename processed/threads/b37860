5 I recently got the 52 Point Spring Clean from these guys...WOW!  My wife has never loved me so much!  We ended up signing up for a regular service!
5 I highly recommend you've got maids. I really appreciate that they go the extra mile to be eco friendly. With young kids, I would hate a bunch of harsh chemicals being used in my house. Fast, professional and affordable.
4 ***Update (7/28/14) - I received a call from Tyler, who is the new owner. He personally wanted to resolve the issues I previously had. I have since moved out of his jurisdiction but he was very professional and I appreciate his follow up on my previous experience and his willingness to rectify the situation! I wish him the best since being an owner is not always easy but he's off to a good start!!!   My previous post:  The communication between staff was less than satisfactory. After talking to their office at least 5 times they failed to book my appointment even though I confirmed it with them twice over the phone. I called a few days prior to the appointment since something didn't feel right. Needless to say they didn't have it so I had to schedule it again.  Now when the 3 maids arrived they were professional and dressed appropriately. Overall they did a good job but spent entirely too much time in the bathrooms. There was one girl per bathroom and the other was handling the rest of the house. The girl in our spare bathroom spent over an hour and a half cleaning the shower. Please note I keep my house pretty clean and that one shower had not been used in 6 months so spending that amount of time was not necessary. Ultimately they charged me over $300, which at the time seemed like a lot but after calling a few other companies in the valley that was entirely too much for the services they actually provided.
