5 Ahhh Food 4 Less what is the reason i dont shop at you more often? I really dont know. Cheaper prices than all the other Grocers Even Walmart. The Bakery puts out fresh cakes and pies, and even has Ethnic foods in the bakery. The Sandwiches are packed full of meat and 3 for 3.98 is not a bad deal at all. I would definitely pay visits to the produce section as everything looked fresh and ripe, especially the watermelon.   The Store is clean, with wide aisles. And seems to be fully stocked and well organized. I guess they keep costs down by not having baggers but thats fine with me.
4 For a few years this has currently been my grocery store for all my essential food and toiletries needs.  I like Food 4 Less because they have a broad and ethnic food selection and I don't have to drive further to Wal-Mart to get my toiletries.  Compared to other grocery stores nearby, their prices are the most reasonable (you pay for what you get) and the quality of their foods (except fruits) are pretty good every time I go.  The only thing I don't like about this Food 4 Less location are people keep asking me for money or soliciting out in the parking lot...  There's usually the same people that hang around there.  I should just carry a sign with my that says, 'college student in tremendous debt' so they won't keep asking me every week.
4 Very helpful & friendly employs
2 This location is exactly the same as the store on Sahara and Nellis. Dirty, unorganized and poorly managed store.
4 Great Prices and Friendly Customer Service
4 The store is in a visibly older building, but the customer service is great. Every single employee greets you with a smile, and even the stockers engage and assist customers. If they had a finished ceiling and nicer looking floors, the store would look much more appealing and would definitely earn five stars.
