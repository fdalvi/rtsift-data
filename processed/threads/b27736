5 I absolutely love this place and went to about 6 different barber shops to find it.  I loved V's but found the price just seemed to high for a haircut so the search was on.  My search led me to Downtown Barber Shop which is ran by a barber that came here from Russia.  The first several times there his son, Arthur, gave me the best hair cut I had at a barbershop 3 consecutive times.  Lo and behold, Arthur was opening his own place and I wasn't about ready to start looking for a new barbershop.  5th Generation Barbers is nicer than the Downtown Barber Shop but it doesn't have quite the same eclectic feeling due to the years of things being accumulated.  The thing that really matter though is the hair cut and they do a phenomenal job consistently.
5 Best barbers I've ever been to and the hot towel shave is a luxury I can't go without
5 I've been going to 5th Generation Barbers since I moved to Phoenix last summer and haven't stopped since. Arthur and his crew take their time and make sure you are getting exactly what you want. As an added bonus, they have two flat screens if you ever wanna catch Sportscenter while getting your trim. Highly recommended!
4 Arthur is a fine barber, albeit with some quirky habits such as taking cell phone calls while cutting your hair :-)  Funny conversations as well.  Overall a great cut.
