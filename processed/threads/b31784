5 I just visited a new Cactus Valley Pool Supply store next to the Safeway at Happy Valley Road & 39th Ave.   The staff was friendly and the prices were great... I'll be back.
1 I just visited the same store and got ripped off.  I purchased goods from the store and one item was defective.  I attempted to return and/or exchange the item and was denied. I had my original sales receipt and all the packaging.  Buyer beware!  Also note - on the sales receipt there is a 15% restocking fee, if they choose to allow the return.  Good luck - I will not shop there again!
1 This store closes at 4:00 on Sunday. Called at 3:50 and asked they lady if they sold and had in stock rubber feet and side flaps for my Hayward Ultra Vac. I was told they do but they close at 4. I said ok can I get a price on them please? She said well it's 5 till. She was more worried about her closing than pricing the parts I need!  Fact is I could have been out my door in her store in less than 3 minutes. I WILL NEVER SHOP HERE AGAIN.  Oh, did I mention Leslie's is only about 3/4s of a mile down the road, open until 6pm on Sundays and was happy to take my money?!
