4 Did NOT disappoint!   I can not stand digging through messy racks, I just don't have the patience, so I was VERY pleased when I walked in and found everything neat and tidy and in it's place :)  There was a nice variety of womens pants, shorts, shirts and even shoes.  The only thing I did not find a whole lot of were sports bras.   The prices were consistently about $10 under the normal retail price, a few items had a bit of a higher discount. Still, for the quality of clothing they have, the prices are right!   I also like that the staff are not pushy and in your face, but they are friendly.
5 The customer service is out standing. Always willing to help you. I will keep shopping there. Better deals than the Nike store and friendly
5 Helped my wife and I find everything we needed and told my wife and I that Cabelas would have the beanie.  Will always shop here. Their products last forever.
5 I love this store. My husband and I have been here three or four times in the past six months and we consistently leave happy with some really great deals.   The staff is friendly and helpful and lets you try on as much stuff as you like.  They will even bring additional items to the dressing room so you don't have to get dressed again and go out looking yourself.  That comes in handy when you thought the medium was the right size but you tried it on and realized you needed a large.  Hate it when that happens.   The store is very clean and neatly organized.  The staff is constantly replenishing the racks.  There is always a ton of gear on the clearance racks and I end up finding way more than I need.  Plus, it's usually an additional 20% off the lowest ticketed price!  Bargain!    They have a really good selection of styles, sizes, and colors in just about everything you can think of workout related.  We went there yesterday in search of tops and bottoms to run in in cold weather.  We had a friendly staff member help us out and we found exactly what we needed.  Shopping here is always a positive experience and I highly recommend it.
