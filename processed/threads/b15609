3 Stopped in for some grub after a visit to Lee's. I was disappointed to find out they no longer offer the Enchirito. Kee'erra was friendly and did offer a comparable substitution though. Overall it was right in line with other TB's I've visited. I will return.
4 Great customer service this morning.  The young man at the counter was quite pleasant.  Food is fresh and good.
