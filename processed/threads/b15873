2 I went here this June after a shoulder injury because it was right down the street from my primary doctor. I was happy/lucky that I was able to get a same day appointment and the office staff was helpful.  However, it all went down hill when I got to see the doctor. I was amazed I didn't have to wait long, but I soon realized why. After xrays, the doctor asked me to raise my arm, I did and stopped when it hurt. He nodded his head, turned to an intern and said, "impingement syndrome." He didn't even look at my shoulder to see that it was swollen or manipulate it to test my strength and range of motion. He decided to give me a cortisone shot.  The intern prepped me, tried to help me calm down, and the doctor gave the shot. After that, the doctor gave me a brochure on impingement syndrome and prescribed me a medicine that my insurance didn't cover. He didn't even fill in the blanks on the brochure to indicate which exercises I should do or for how long.   The shot helped for a couple of days but I couldn't get the prescription because it cost $300. I called his office four  times that week asking for a generic prescription, but they never returned my call.   Finally, I gave up and went to another doctor.
5 Dr. Yee did both my right and left total hip replacements, one year after another. He also did a laparoscopic surgery on my left knee. He is by far the best orthopedic surgeon I have ever been to. He is very knowledgeable and is also very friendly. His staff is awesome and his assistant, Joy, is amazing. I am back doing my regular activities and working out at the gym. I would recommend Dr. Yee to anyone searching for a good orthepedic surgeon.
5 Looking for a great doctor to tend to your shoulder or knee? Look no further. Dr. Randall Yee is the best. He did my TKR and it was as perfect as can be--no complications whatsoever. He also has an excellent staff--all are congenial and take time to answer questions.
