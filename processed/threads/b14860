5 I love Etch Salon - conveniently located in Kierland Commons - close to restaurants, bars and shopping!!  A full service salon with everything that you need - including all of your best care products as well. Thomy does my hair - and lets face it....trusting someone to your hair is right up there with trusting your gynecologist!!
4 This used to be my salon of choice until I began spending more time in Chandler and decided it was time to go elsewhere.  My best friend gets her cut and color done there now, and loves it - see Janelle!  I used to just get a haircut, but always had an enjoyable experience...and recommend it to friend's new to town and looking for a hair stylist.    To be honest, one of my favorite things about getting my hair done there was people watching and checking out what all the stylists are wearing.....they are always trendy and cute.   Prices are average - $60 for a hair cut.
4 I've found my new Diva-Heaven and it's aesthetician Goddess is Lacey.   First of all, they were able to fit me in after I missed my previous appointment at a cheesier day spa {thank u! thank u! thank u!} And then I spent a great hour with one of the most personable & thorough aestheticians that I've ever held my leg in the air for: Lacey C. Not only were hands lightening fast...she ensured that no strays were left behind!!   If you find yourself having a Chupacabra moment... don't hesitate to make an appointment with Ms L.  You won't be disappointed.
4 I have been going to a genius stylist for about 5 years now, but she's been traveling so much recently that I was forced to see someone new for my last appointment.  I've driven past Etch at Kierland Commons dozens of times, and have recently had a couple of friends try them out with fairly decent results. I prefer to have my hair colored and cut by the same person, and they were happy to accommodate. However, I believe that they normally schedule a separate stylist, colorist, assistant, etc.  My appointment was with Janine, who had her work cut out for her when I went in - my hair was about 8 inches longer than it needed to be and my roots had started taking over. I was a little nervous to have my long hair cut drastically short by someone I hadn't been to before, but she did a fantastic job, and did so with very little instruction/guidance. The color was perfect and I couldn't have asked for a better cut. I really enjoyed the salon. It is clean, edgy and appears to have all of the latest and greatest hair styling toys. The entire experience ran me $170, which is more than i typically pay, but I think it is a competitive price for the area. The salon is open late and on weekends, which is very convenient. I will definitely return.  **I should also mention that another friend of mine, Fuzzy (called that because of his fuzzy hair), who has had his hair cut by the same barber since he was 6 years old, was recently given an extreme-hair-makeover by Ryan.  Ryan not only proved his genius status by seriously updating his look, but was very friendly along the way and patiently showed Fuzzy how to keep up his style after he left the salon. Great experiences all-around.
2 Good hair cut but the people their act like their better then the rest of the universe. I dont appreciate going to places where I am paying good money to feel bad about the way I look. Way to pricey.85 dollars for a haircut! yeh right.
4 Went to a nail salon close to where I work for gels...they were thick, uneven and the lack of quality just may have been due to the manicurist taking calls while she was doing my nails.  A friend whose nails always look really nice recommended Yen at Etch.  WOW!  Like night and day.  Of course the fill was more expensice $45, but this is DEFINITELY a case of you get what you pay for.  They look so natural - great color, shape, length - AND THEY'RE THIN AND EVEN!!!!  adn let me just add this - she did all this in a shorter time than normal because I had booked an appointment for something else.  Really good job - and I wasn't exhausted from too much chatting.  Sometimes I just want to relax.  No problem here! Oh, and she also does color gels (and pedicures, which I will try next!).
5 Oh MY gosh! I just came back from the most glorious hair and cut experience ever!  Ashley, did the most amazing job on my very thick, curly hair.  I finally found a stylist who can manage curly hair, they are hard to come by!  Thanks, Ashley, you are the best, I will absolutely be back.
1 This place blows like a con-air.  Everyone has an expensive stick up their ass ( that they bought on credit and now cannot afford to pay for), not to mention terrible personal style...why would I trust Ricky Martin with the white pants and Ed Hardy fedora to touch MY style? The only thing going for this etch-a-sketchy is the shampoo girl, she gotz long nailz...i mean fingerz.
5 ASHLEY, Really, every time?  Today I just went in for a trim and decided to have her blow my very curly hair straight.  Ashley is absolutely adorable, (and I am not holding that against her)!  I love that she is able to listen to what I want.  I love that she understands that I actually know my hair better than anyone.  I also love that she always stresses that if there is something i don't like, she promises to get me right back in to fix it.  If you are looking for a new stylist...pick up your phone and call her NOW before the rest of Scottsdale finds out about her...won't be long now.
5 I will be honest... this salon is a little more expensive than others but you really get your moneys worth.  I've been to several other high end salons in Phoenix but Etch hits the mark.  I'm definitely going back!  I went to Ashely (thanks to Patti's recommendation below) and I agree, she is adorable!  I went in needing some highlights and a trim and once I saw her (Ashely's) hair I said, "I want your hair!" and she did it!  I love my hair and my boyfriend agrees that sometimes a girl just needs to spend a little more to feel beautiful and Ashely did just that.  I went from dishwater blonde to Kate Hudson golden and I love it!  If you are looking to go blonde see Ashley!
5 David is great. He has cut my hair for 4 years. I moved away but still fly in to see him.
5 Lynn Felix is AMAZING!  She has been cutting/styling my hair for the past two years. I have tried numerous salons (all price ranges), and there isn't anyone who has come close to her expertise, sense of style, professionalism and friendliness.  Do yourself a favor.  Call Lynn today!  You will be very happy.
5 As a referral from Janice Hurley-Trailor, Brooke did my hair at this salon, and I loved it.  The color changed and so did the style, as a result of a makeover directed by Ms. Hurley-Trailor, and for my hair--via a consultation with Janice & Brooke.  (I gave my permission to take full liberty in the change).  The result was dramatic and different, and though it's been since Dec 14, I get compliments almost everyday on my hair (and other aspects of Janice's change). I love the hair.  With thin fine hair, I didn't think it could be styled the way it is, or that I would like a shorter length.  But it looks great and is pretty easy for me to style and maintain also--these latter are just as important as how it looks and falls.    The cut and color are fantastic, and I treated very well all during the event.  And event it was!  Thank you Brook, and to Janice Hurley-Trailor for the exceptional referral and make-over.
5 I had a fabulous experience with the lovely Paige at Etch Salon this past Sunday.  How convenient that the joint is open on a Sunday!  I arrived and was warmly greeted by the nicest receptionist with such a sunny disposition.  When it was my turn in the chair, Paige and I discussed in length how to address my mop.  We agreed on a very-overdue cut, serious grey-coverage color and she also suggested some caramel highlights to "show off the cut."  I knew we were on the same page from the start and that allowed me to relax and enjoy the service and conversation :)  The salon is gorgeous-clean and modern.  Paige is patient, gentle and a very talented stylist!  My hair looks and feels fabulous and I got so many compliments at work today!
5 I've been going to Lynn Felix at Etch from the time the salon opened about 10 years ago.  The salon is modern,  clean and I am always treated nicely by the front desk staff, but Lynn is the only reason I go there.  She used to own her own salon and her years and years of experience has made going to get my hair cut and colored a relaxing experience instead of an hour of nail biting terror waiting to see if I like the results!   She never cuts more than I ask and when I went to her for highlights, the first time ever, I was even more impressed by her.  She is a true hair professional.   She has her own curly hair so she knows how to cut curly hair to look great when you want to wear it straight or curly, and that's not an easy thing to do.  If you are looking for a hair stylist who knows what she is doing, is fast, professional then you have to look no further.  The only problem with Etch has nothing to do with Lynn or the salon itself, is the parking during season.  The parking lot where Etch is located is small to begin with and a Valet station has taken two whole rows closest to the salon for it's own use.  The problem is the area is blocked off but there is never anyone at the Valet station.  So if you can't valet the car and you try to find a space during season, especially on Saturdays (any time of the year) you are forced to drive around for several, and I mean five to ten minutes or go into the parking garage which will result in a little walk so bring comfy shoes.   I think the Valet should park the cars in the garage and let the lot be for self parkers.   It makes no sense to take up the spaces 20 feet from the salon, where a client can easily walk, to make things easier for the valet.
5 Jennifer Lynn has been my hair dresser and my kids hair dresser for years now.  She is very talented with cutting and coloring and always gives my whole family a great new do.. The salon is in a great location at Kierland also...
5 I got a referral for Lynn Felix...........I have not even been to her yet but based on the referral, her hair cut Was AMAZING!   you could see the difference and the skill!  Can't wait to see what Lynn does with my hair!   LOL
5 I have only used Kristen for my skin services!! I thought My acne was never going to go away, and it was even hard for me to be seen in public at times because of how bad my skin was, but I highly reccomend her! She is an acne specialist, and she KNOWS what she is doing! If you are fed up with your bad skin, go see her seriously she won't disappoint!
5 Just one word:  Ellie.  Ellie Davis is a genius with color and hair.  I never tell her what to do, just like I would not tell any artist what to do.  And the result is stunning.  People stop me on the street to ask who does my hair.  My husband loves it.  I get my roots done once a month, and Ellie does highlights, lowlights, and haircuts as she deems necessary.  She is not a diva; that's just how much I trust her.  Book early as Ellie is one busy lady.  You will be glad you put your hair in her capable hands.
5 LOVE THIS PLACE!! I used to drive to south scottsdale and paid well over $250 for a cut and foil for my long, thick dark hair. I decided to try Etch b/c of location. I called and asked for a stylist who is great with coloring dark hair. Think kardashian dark... Well they set me up with TYLER BUSH and WOW!  Tyler did an amazing ombre on my hair and I get stopped all the time with compliments. It is gorgeous! He is always up to date with styles and I trust him so much now that I sit in the chair and let him do his MAGIC!
4 Moved here from LA after seeing the same colorist for over 7 years. I was terrified to try someone new after do long with the same person and I have found the transition easy, stress free and been happy with the results of Tyler working on my hair.  He is a great colorist, stylist and does great updos. Really nice guy too.  I highly recommend.
5 I can't believe I've lived here for over 4 years and just discovered this place!  There are so many great things about this salon.  1.  It's like a club!  Great music (Kaskade radio?) and a very upbeat atmosphere.  This place is so much more fun than a typical salon.  2.  VERY reasonably-priced.  It's a nice Scottsdale salon so still expect to pay a premium, but I was very pleasantly surprised when I left after a full cut and color in under $200 of damage.   3.  Kyle - hair NINJA.  Seriously his hands are fast like a samurai, and I was out an hour less than I'd planned for - AMAZING.  Oh and he's gorgeous and made my hair look almost as good as his.  Best salon I've been to in Phoenix - period.
5 I posted previously about Etch and hairdresser/magician/artist Ellie Davis. Like any artist I respect, I let her do her own thing. My hair has never looked better. People stop me in the street to ask me who does my hair. My husband loves it. And it's all Ellie because I do nothing to my hair when I get out of the shower except comb it straight back. On a cold day, I'll point a blow dryer at it. Ellie understands my no fuss needs and my hair looks fabulous all the time.
5 I had a great experience at Etch Salon! The facility is beautiful and it is in a great location (in Keirland Commons). Jillian is amazing and gave me a beautiful haircut! I was making a dramatic change and showed her two pictures of what I wanted and she did it perfectly! I would not only recommend the salon but if you need a new stylist, Jillian is wonderful!
