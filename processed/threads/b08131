5 Kaila's teeth are just about perfect.
5 My son has been a patient at both Dr. Wright's Chandler location, and this Mesa location for about 3 years now. The doctor is wonderful, the staff is fast and knowledgeable and the office staff is efficient and very nice.   The amenities Dr. Wright provides for his patients make visits fun.  They have electronic check-ins, a tooth brushing station, a fun variety of band colors, an ice cream freezer for after the visit, and fun trivia contests and raffles each month. (Our family favorite was the Halloween pumpkin contest where the staff decorated pumpkins and the patients voted for the best.)  Now that my son is almost done with his braces, I'm excited to get started on my own!
5 I have been coming to Wright Orthodontics for close to two years and very satisfied with the results of the invisilgns. The staff is so efficient and professional. I highly recommend this establishment to anyone for their ortho needs. They all really take the time to be 'present' with you at your appointment, very special indeed.
