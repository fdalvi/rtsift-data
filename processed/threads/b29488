5 I love this place... friendly service and a clean and dry car when you leave. I am a premium member and use this car wash about 3 times a week and my car looks awesome! They give you the same service here for $2.00 less for a car wash than many competitors. If you looking for a car wash you keep your car looking new then this is the one I'd recommend.
3 Purchased a groupon for unlimited car washes for 3 months for $18. Which is a fairly good deal, but it took at least 15-20 minutes to get it all set up.  It's not a hand car wash but one of those automatic washes. Everything is automated from the moment you drive-up to pay. But, if you have a problem with the payment, it took a LONG time to get it rectified. (Not a lot of staff people on hand to ask questions)  When you drive into the wash, there's an attendant that'll offer you a blue towel, which you use to dry off your car.  The process of washing is no more than 5 minutes.   Once you exit you can drive into a spot and vacuum your own car and drive off with the towel they give you.  I had some issues with my groupon and having it work automatically. It took the guy at least 20 minutes to fix the problem.   Being from LA, I thought this was a great deal, but come to find out most automatic car washes average about $3 in town.
