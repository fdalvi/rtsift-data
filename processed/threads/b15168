5 This is a great spot all year around.  They are everywhere now as well.  They recently started a birthday club where you get a "love it" size ice cream valid from your birthday to two weeks away.  This Cold Stone also does great fundraisers for schools.  They are busy, but well worth the wait!
5 I've been a Cold Stone fan for years and while just about everything I've tried is amazing, I have created my 'go-to' favorite.  I get sweet cream ice cream, with raspberries and chocolate shavings.  Sometimes, if I'm really treating myself, I add whip cream to the mix.  Everything is delicious, the staff is always friendly and overall the place has a great atmosphere.  I think I just may need to make a visit tonight!
