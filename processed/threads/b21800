5 This is THE T-Mobile store to go to.  Super friendly staff who are very knowledgeable about the phones which really the main reason you go to a mobile phone store.
5 BEST T-mobile store ever! They are all super helpful, knowledgeable and really friendly! The guy that was helping me I think his name was David (?), helped answer all my questions, about upgrading, and even up coming phones.
5 I have had two experiences here.  They both were great.  I love that this store is in a little nook, so it is never crowded.  It is also very clean and bright.  They go above and beyond to help their customers.  Shout out to Nicole B. who spent a generous amount of time with me last week making sure I had everything transferred back onto my replacement phone.  She embodies the meaning of customer service: knowledgeable, patient, persistent and pleasant!
