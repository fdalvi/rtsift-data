5 Great donuts especially when they are hot.  Not too sweet.  Cheap.  My new breakfast place.
5 Yummm... These donuts are great... The cinnamon sugar donuts remind me of the churros in Disneyland! Reasonably priced too. What a nice quick breakfast or an afternoon treat!
5 These donuts are the best and at $2.50 for 7, everyone should give them a try.  They are made fresh, fast, and taste so good when they are hot that I almost ate them all before I pulled out of the parking lot.  Owners are super friendly!
4 Tried this truck out at First Friday this month. Enjoyed the yummy donuts but what really Wowed me was the service. They came out with a smile serving the yummy cinnamon donuts and offering coupons for the next time I checked out their truck! definitely worth checking out.
5 These donuts are UNREAL. I mean, lets be real, is there anything better than fresh and hot donuts?  Try the "Omar Special" you won't regret. For only 2.50 (or 3.50 with 2 toppings) for a set of 7, you can't go wrong.  Seriously though, go here. YUM.
5 So goddamn good.  Its the complete opposite of Teen Wolf 2, but in your mouth.
