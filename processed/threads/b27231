4 I have an older Acura.  The R12 needed replaced in the air conditioning. John at Auto Tune said they carried R12 but it was really expensive.  He told me they had a similar product, Freeze12, that would work just as well at a fraction of the cost.  They also looked at some other issues on the vehicle.  I was impressed that they offered alternatives that were much less expensive.  I would not have known there was an option to R12, and they could have charged me a much higher price.  John was friendly and helpful and I will make the drive to take my vehicle there again.
4 Great shop with a good group of Mechanics.  I've taken quite a few cars there. Support your local shops and still get it done cheaper.
