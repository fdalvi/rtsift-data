5 Please check it out. This place has a nice small ma pa feel to it which really makes it nice. I bring my dog here every chance I get and you should too
5 Fantastic.  I might sound silly, but my dog was happier after his grooming with them  compared to his demeanor following being groomed elsewhere.  Also, the fee was reasonable, and they don't try to sell you things you don't want.
5 I just relocated to the Phoenix area and have been looking for a grooming salon.  I took my 2 shihtzu's here last week for the first time after checking it out beforehand.  I was very impressed with how clean and quiet the salon was.  Not a lot of barking dogs and noise like many other salons.  I am very particular about my dogs grooming and well being.  They listened to how I wanted them clipped and they looked great when they were done!  Also I noticed my dogs were not nearly as nervous or anxious here when I took them in and when I picked them up!!  It was a great find and will definitely be taking my girls there again!!!
5 Fantastic! I was very impressed with the job they did on my shorkie. I consider myself to be very picky about how my dog is groomed. The minute I walked in, the greeting was very warm. My groomer took the time to ask me questions on what I liked and disliked about her current cut. They were done with her at the promised time. And oh yeah, she looked so adorable when I picked her up!!!! Will for sure go back!!!
