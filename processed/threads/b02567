4 It has been a while since I've been here, so this is based on memory.  This is the type of smaller music store that used to be more common before the advent of Guitar Center.  You'll find an array of newer instruments, mostly lower-end guitars and basses.  They typically have a decent selection of used amplifiers and instruments, a feature Guitar Center lacks.  Plenty of accessories (cables, straps, midi-cables, picks, etc.) are available.  An above-average store for the budget minded musician.
3 They are what they say they are, a discount shop of sorts for musicians.  Focused mainly on amateur musicians, they have a decent selection of new and used electric guitars and basses.  The focus more towards ibanez and danelectro in their selection.  The acoustic guitar room is pretty shoddy.  They have a few quality guitars that they accepted for trade in usually and then way too many Johnson and other subpar branded guitars.  Great for first guitars maybe, but one should really spend the money for a decent brand of guitar as it will hold some resale value while allowing the musician to advance.  They have a good selection of percussion stuff.  Not really kits or anything, more just supplies.  You can find the chord you need here, better to get it at this small shop than a megastore.  Trade in value is pretty good and the staff is super nice.  In Phoenix you have to take what you can get in regards to music stores, this one is worth visiting.
4 Its kinda small but I bought a whole practice setup for less than i could at the swap meet here.  The people working here were super helpful (they sell used cables!  yay!) They have a decent selection of amps pedals and slides. . .  i didnt really pay much attention to the guitars as thats not what i went for but they, uh, had a bunch hanging, if that helps.
