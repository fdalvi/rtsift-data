5 If you are looking for a top notch attorney with a customer mindset, then you want to consider Barber Law Group, PLLC. I was extremely impressed with fast and postive results with major attention to customer service. I highly recommend the Law Firm.
5 I simply used the Contact links on the website and had answers to my questions in less than 12 hours. Also, all these answers were given to me free of charge, honestly and presented in a way I could understand. As a young working professional, I would highly recommend contacting this organization if you are ever in need of legal services. The service was outstanding and I have already recommended this group to family and friends.
5 Bretton Barber is the most honest, fair priced and professional attorney I have ever come across. I shopped around when I needed to have something set aside on my record quickly for a job. I feared that if I went with a "cheaper" attorney that I would suffer the consequences. Well, I couldn't have been more wrong! Bretton was easy to talk to and got to work on my case immediately. I will definitely recommend him to people and will use him again in the future if the need arises!!
