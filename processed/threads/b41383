3 Small store with all basic indian stuff, the staff are courteous and extended their time to accommodate us. I wish they carried more choice precooked food and veggies in the store
1 Been here 3 times and all 3 times the store was not fully stocked. Not organized nor clean. The pictures they posted are deceiving...shelves were empty.  Not a huge choices of masalas compared to other Indian stores. I was not greeted by the staff... They were very cold. Smile goes a long way. Unfortunately this was the closet store to me but I will have to drive further out to another one.
3 Simple store with basic indian groceries. Store is clean and staff are courteous. Items are pricey , minimum of 20% more than market price. I like the store except for the prices
