5 I used to live right by Jones tire so I anytime I needed something to do with my car, Jones was the spot. But I moved across the city and had to find a new auto repair place. I went to 2 other repair shops and had really bad service at both! I took that as a sign so I'm back to Jones! I don't care if they are out of my way, the service and reliability you get from Jone's is priceless.
5 Bob Jones the owner is a stand up guy. Very nice and understanding. Offers honest and honest service. Its my second visit and I feel comfortable coming to him with all my car troubles.
