5 What a jewel in the desert.  It is a small theater but the talent is a good as it gets.  I saw "The Drowsy Chaperone" and it was a great production.  I highly recommend you get out there and see one of their productions.
4 This was my first time at a small/community theater. I had such a great time! I went to see "And Then There Were None" by Agatha Christie. Great cast..loved that everyone used a British accents. I got my tickets through an email for "show up". We had 2nd row. The sound was great, effects were great. The employees were really very helpful and the show was very well acted. If I had a small complaint, the entrance is a bit uninviting. The doors that lead into the lobby look like plain, gray doors, so I wasn't sure if that was the actual entrance or not. I also liked that the restrooms and water fountains were right in the theater. Very convenient.
5 It's great to have such a well run community theatre right here in Fountain Hills. The productions and acting are fun and well done. For the price per ticket it can't be beat. Excellent value.
4 I love coming to see productions at this intimate theater in Fountain Hills. I went to see their latest (and controversial!) production of The Full Monty. For a non contract (or 'professional' ) theater, the show was outstanding!!! And there isn't a bad seat in the house...but they do sell out quickly, so if you are interested in seeing a production, get your tickets quickly, and never try to buy them at the door!
5 This show is one I have seen several times before BUT it still is such a great comedy that it was worth repeating.  I laughed so hard I hurt.  The situations were just too hysterical.  I had heard (although I had seen it before) that it had some "terrible language" in it.  Not so.  Only a true prude would not enjoy the situations and comedy.  I live in Phoenix but it was worth the trip and I'll be going to the next show they have.
2 We've been to Fountain Hills Theater several times and always enjoyed ourselves. Last night we saw Sherlock Holmes Last Case which could more appropriately be named Sherlock Holmes Worst Case. Although the cast and crew did a passable job, the play itself was a yawn-generator from the opening scene. It's like the writer couldn't decide whether he was scripting a comedy spoof or a serious mystery so it ended up as neither. Again, the cast & crew did a passable job and the only fault I can find with the theater is choosing to stage this dreadful dreck in the first place.
4 Went with some girlfriends to go see I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change down at the Fountain Hills Theater for a girls afternoon out.     It was my 1st time at the theater and I have to say I like it a lot! It's a small intimate theater, but it just means you're more engaged with the show.    The seats are on the small side, so if you have long legs, you might be a little uncomfortable, but I was up in the front and didn't have to worry about that issue.   I really don't think there is a bad seat in the place, the show was great, we had a great time and I look forward to catching more shows at Fountain Hills Theater.
