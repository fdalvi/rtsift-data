2 I was out shopping and decided to stop in because it has been years since I last had Gloria Jean's coffee. I ordered an iced coffee and my daughter ordered a blended mocha. My iced coffee was ok I guess I ended up throwing away most of it and the blended mocha was super sweet. Maybe if I visited more I would come up with a favorite, but with Starbucks just down the way I will continue on next time.
2 I was born and raised in the Greater Seattle Area, but I don't consider myself a coffee snob. I don't even drink that much of it. My orders are always the same, tall soy latte with no flavor at 120 degrees. Such a simple order that is only improved (or unimproved as is the case here) by the type of soy milk used or the coffee beans.   This coffee stand is located inside of a mall and because of this most likely has a large overhead. That overhead gets passed on to me the consumer, naturally, and what should be a $2.50 drink becomes a $3.75 drink. Not a big deal normally, however, IT IS when the product being put in my cup and subsequently going down my throat is not even worth the cup that separates my hand from the scorching liquid within.   Two stars GJC.
4 I love the variety of flavors here. So many choices and they make it so well. It helps to stay cool while you walk the mall. My only complaint is that blended drinks are a little pricey, but the staff is friendly and smiling.
