5 The 5 stars I give this place is not for their food, because we all know what McDonalds is.  I go here almost every morning for my iced coffee that I love and adore.  I give them 5 stars because Ive come to know the staff there and they just rock.    Maritza, Kiara, Maria and BB are among the best there and make my mornings a great one.
3 Running around I got the munchies and stopped in for a couple of egg McMuffins.  They tasted the same as they have since they were invented in Santa Barbara decades ago.  The staff was friendly and I got my sandwiches quickly.    I thought I had reviewed this location several years ago when I was here for a UYE fundraiser for Julia T's school.
2 Granted if you've seen one McDonalds you've pretty much seen 'em all. However when I tried to order a caramel coffee - it's like I was speaking another language. I even explained how to make it and they still got it wrong.   They refunded my money and I got a Coke instead.
