5 This is the best pizza in vegas. the best pizza ive ever eatin in my life. i had the panormous pan pizza, the pepperoni's were huge, there were 8 huge square peices i got full off 1 and im a big eater so there it is. ive never been here so of course they deliver and the prices were not bad. the pizza box even was freakin awesome and looked expensive. i give this a 10.
4 Go there with low expectations but a big appetite. Not bad for fast food pizza.
4 Marcos has some of the best pizza around.  It is quick and delicious.  The crust is just the right thickness.  The sauce has a ton of flavor and there is a lot of it on each pie.  The toppings are in fair quantity.  I'm not sure if they are still using canned mushrooms.  They used to.  It has been a while since I've had a Marcos pizza with mushroom.  If they are still using canned, I wish they would use fresh.  Besides the pizza, the cinnamon bread is a must.  It is chewy and fluffy.  It is buttery and sweet.  Unreal.
5 Great pizza and my favorite cheese bread.Great service as well
4 We were first timers and they were busy but awesome pizza.... Think I found a new Friday night dinner
