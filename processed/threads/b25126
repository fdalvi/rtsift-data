3 Dr. Fechtel is a wonderful Optometrist and I am glad that I stumbled onto his office totally by random selection - he is in my insurance network and his office is closest to my house plus I was interested in selecting Oakley frames and they do carry that brand.  So there you have it, fate.  On the negative side; from the time you order your glasses till the date you actually get them is a bit of a LONG wait.  I ordered my glasses on Oct 26th and it is now Nov 6th and still no glasses although I was given the impression that I would have time by last Friday.  I was contacted today and the office rep informed me that it now may be another week to 10 days before they are ready due to some screw up at the lab.  That means that I will have to wait about 3 weeks for a new pair of glasses.  Now that's not that big of a deal for me because I am still using my 5 year old glasses which work reasonably well for me but if you are someone that had maybe lost their glasses and needed them right away, well, based on my experience, good luck.  Now let me repeat, Active Eye Care claims that the reason my glasses are taking exceptionally long to deliver is due to a screw-up at the lab and AEC does claim that a "rush" has been requested on filling my Rx.  We'll see.
2 My STAR rating has gone down one STAR.  In my previous post; my chief complaint about this eye care provider was the long wait to receive my new glasses.  Well, I would like to report that my glasses are now here but NOPE, 20 days later and still no word from the Active Eye Care office if and when I may expect delivery and this being after a "rush" was put on the new specs.  Wonder how long it would take without the so called "rush"?
5 Purchased a set of okley's with transition lenses. Angie was very helpful, making sure the frames fit my giant face. Thank you!
5 Recently purchased my third pair of glasses from Active Eye Care. Customer service has always been excellent. I appreciate the good selection of eye wear.
