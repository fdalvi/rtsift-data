5 The best massage on the west side and great prices. The therapists cater appropriately to your needs, focusing on the healing and relaxation of your body. Friendly owners and great ambiance with the music and lighting. 60+ minute massages come with a warm/hot water tub to soak and sooth your feet while your receive a scalp and upper body massage. Following is the foot reflexology, where the muscles are relaxed at intricate points to the pressure of your comfort. Finally, legs, back, and neck to again, the pressure of your liking. Additional services include hot towel wash after the massage. I go in tense and come out completely refreshed! Enjoy!
