4 I took my little Ryder here for the free preview "Family Music" class. Since its still summer and hot at the parks for playdates I was hoping to find someplace indoors for him. The staff here actually get 5 stars. The ladies are all very friendly & helpful. The prices are a bit high for the classes $65 a month but it includes a few days a week of the PlayGym they have there..which consists of every major toy for them to jump/crawl/play on. They also offer many  other age appropriate classes..for more money of course. There were alot of nannys there so I felt kinda out of place being one of the only moms. Which was a new experience, guess its the location? Im sure we will sign up for the music class. We had fun playing with all the instruments and the singing was fun as well. Go for the free class..even if you dont sign up its a free day out with your little one!
1 We will never go here again. Every time we take our daughter here the next day she is sick. The last two times she has gotten viral infections and we have to go to the ER as she got a temp of 105. Obviously this place is not cleaning their facility properly!!!!!!
