2 The agents were VERY friendly, which what I would expect from Hawaiian, but the process is all messed up. You get your boarding pass from the Kiosk, with your bags, then you wait in a VERY crowded space to check your bag. If you have to see an agent for unaccompanied minors or routing changes, you go into another line and wait until there are no bags to check.  This is about as friendly as Spirit Airlines where they don't care about their passengers.  Thank goodness I wasn't flying, just taking a friend.  If I have to check a bag, I will fly someone else, just because of the chaos.
5 Just want to Say ThankYou Hawaiian Airlines for Making My Grandparents Flight Very Enjoyable. They Say Nothing But good things
5 AZ to HI flight:  - Left on time, arrived 30 minutes early. Got lucky! - Breakfast of fruit slices, cheese & crackers, and orange juice. I thought it was tastefully done for a complementary meal.   - snack: Maui chips and a rum punch (some new product promotion. Damn lucky for drinkers. Drinks are usually so expensive!)  - Water was offered thru out the flight. It worked for me!
4 AZ to HI flight -arrived 30 minutes ahead of schedule -complimentary beer or wine -meals were fulfilling  -staff was nice and made trip comfortable
3 Not the best.  Crews are too new.  Not experienced enough to deal with first class (probably why it's the least expensive airline for first).  Their first class lounges all SUCK.  Horrible furniture. Old and stinky in HNL airport.  Can't leave your luggage in a secure area - has to be "in your possession" at all times.  They are the only f/c lounge I know that doesn't have a secure area for luggage. On my 6 hour layover every time I wanted to go get something to eat or drink I had to lug my bags with me :-((  It's also WAY too cold in the lounge.  And they only have ONE TV.   Come on Hawaiian - I love you but it's a love hate relationship.  I'll probably just go coach next time since there's no "get what you pay for" in first.
