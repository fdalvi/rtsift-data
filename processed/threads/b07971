5 Lindsey was a big help at the register with our very special request!    We'd seen this ugly pair of sneakers kicking around at every Sports Authority for the past year.  I mean they have a dozen or more in the clearance section at every location and they don't move.  So I asked Lindsey if they would haggle.  I mean these are UGLY shoes and they have a lot of them.   Lindsey called over a manager and they looked at something on the computer and... then said OK.  Made my day!  Now my daughter has a CHEAP pair of ugly basketball shoes!  I'm very happy.  Thanks Lindsey!
