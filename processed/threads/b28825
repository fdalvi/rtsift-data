5 A gift shop that sells what appears to be the scrapings from Pan's Labyrinth's cutting room floor, if you're into fairies, kelpies, elves or other fantastical beings then you've found your place. This shop stocks them all, in ornamental form.  It's most famous for the owner though, a wonderfully nuts woman who I expect spends her spare days sitting cross legged at an ancient stone circle, not wearing shoes and taking massive quantities of hallucinogenic drugs. She's so far removed from life on Planet Earth you can't help but feel jealous of her, and while I'm not quite the target demographic, I'm glad her shop does well.
3 Enchantment is very enchanting indeed and as soon as you walk in you are surrounded by fairy figurines, crystals and various other magic related items.  I can imagine this place would be ideal for people who are into alternative healing therapies with their range of crystals on offer and the whole shop has a very peaceful, tranquil feel to it.   It's a little bit different to your average shop and I can't see myself ever needing anything from it but if fairy's float your boat, then why not?
4 I always say this about shops of this nature, but fairy ornaments etc remind me of the wicca craze that hit in the mid to late 90s. Perhaps Charmed and Buffy saw that trend flying into my high school, and I distinctly remember my then best friend's room looking not unlike this shop.  Shops like Enchantment are becoming fewer and further between, but it's nice that this one still does well. There are little pewter ornaments of delicate garden sprites, elves and fairies lining the shelves of this place, and dangling from the ceiling in abundance.  If you're into pixies, healing stones and a touch of magic, then you'll like it. My mum likes ornaments like these and it's a great wee resource not too far from the Royal Mile if you're looking for an impish wee pressie. It's a nice change from seeing green ornaments in the shape of Loch dwelling monsters.
