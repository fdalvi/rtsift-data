1 This organization is full on promises and empty on delivery. They will string you on for months, keeping you on the hook, asking for additional information, and then never deliver. It's hard to see how they remain in business.
1 NACA is the true predator! I am a physician and have the income, documents, etc. all in order to qualify for a mortgage. SEVEN months and hundreds of pages faxed and got nowhere. They are a scam...collecting $50 membership fees from as many people as possible and stringing them along. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!
5 Yup they do take a long time to get things process, not going to lie, but in the end it's all worth it.  Yes, they do add on $50 membership fee a month to your loan, but if you need help, it helps you not the bank.  The bank paid all my fees, we had to come up with our insurance upfront.  Just remember they work with people that don't have the greatest credit, so it takes time.  We had a foreclosure, they said they could work with us 2 years after our foreclosure.  During that two years we rented a house and saved and paid stuff off and got our finances in order so that when we went to NACA it would not take long to get through their bureaucracy and jump through their hoops.  Yes, it was frustrating, yes I felt like pulling my hair out, yes it does drag on for months, yes they do ask for the same information more than once and yes this program does work.  We got a $201,000 loan for 2.75% for 30 years.  For 2.75% interest rate on a 30 year loan, yes it was worth it.  Perseverance, patience and a good realtor who stays on top of things.  If we would of had a lazy realtor we probably would have lost the house.  Between us both we got things done.
