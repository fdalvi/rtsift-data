5 I have now purchased my chicken feed from this group three different times and I could not be happier!  The quality is incredible!  You can really see a difference in the feed we purchase from our local feed store and the feed purchased from this co-op.  This feed smells fresh, you can see actual pieces of real food, and it's organic.  It makes me feel good to know that my chickens are getting a great quality feed and I do not have to spend a fortune to provide it for them.  The pickup location is not the most convenient for my family, but we do not mind driving a little out of the way for the quality and cost savings.  If you have chickens, I would definitely recommend giving this co-op a try.
5 Love this! I get great chicken feed for less money! Lots of feed options and a very organized program. Drove from Mesa had no trouble finding pick up location. Getting my feed was easy and my hens are happy! Much less processed and can get organic mash with no corn or soy. I will be a regular. Thank you!
5 Mr Scooter is awesome he is knowledgeable and loves to hear how my chickens are doing.  he has also given me some good pointers in how to raise my girls properly.  The organic feed is the same price i was paying for crappy regular feed. Scooter always has his cowboy hat on and is there to greet us with a big smile.  thank you.
5 Thanks so much for making it possible to get quality Organic Feed for our girls. I just wanted to drop you some kudos! Our chickens are so happy with the feed we order from the co-op. I had to buy a bag of organic layer crumble from a feed store to hold us over till the feed comes. They turned their beaks up at it! That shows you the quality of the feed we get, or how picky our chickens are;). Thank you so much for all you do to get us the feed we need. I know it is no easy task and wanted you to know how happy you are making us and our hens.
