3 Brick oven pizza is the BEST as far as I am concerned but this place doesn't quite deliver.  It's just not quite in the same quality category as my beloved Me-N-Ed's in Central Cali.  But it IS Brick oven pizza and it IS pretty good!!  Average price, fantastic friendly staff and gelato!! The BBQ chicken Pizza is a family favorite.  Maybe that's why I am not a huge fan.  I prefer the classic pepperoni and extra cheese (sometimes add pineapple and jalape√±o) or a combo.  I am not too big on the BBQ mixin with my Pizza. Anyway... I digress.  This place is not to be avoided! Not sayin I am running here every time I crave pizza... but I never complain when the family requests it!
5 For such a quick pizza joint and premade crusts we were in love with this place.  Guy behind the counter was very patient as we drooled over the menu possibilities and assisted us with our choices.
1 Tried to go to Redbrick last night and found out it closed nine months ago. So if you are in Vegas and want GF Pizza, you gotta look somewhere else.
