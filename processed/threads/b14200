1 Clouded judgment on the way home from a night out led me here.  I had a giftcard. so I figured why not?    A couple hours later I had a conversation with "Ralph" on the big porcelain telephone  that gave a couple answers to "why not".  Ugh.  Maybe I deserved to be punished.
1 The worst Jack in the Box I have EVER BEEN TO!!! They constantly get your order wrong, the food is literally dropping with grease so badly that the bag is completely soaked!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!!!!
1 Honestly, one star is still to good of a rating for this location! If you love burnt food, atrocious customer serivce, and long wait times then this location is perfect for you.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!
