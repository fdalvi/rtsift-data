4 They seem to have pretty much anything you would want. I don't have a military background, but the place seems complete. They can draft dog tags on the spot as well.
5 40% surplus, 30% cheap knock off Asian made, 30% American made cheapie.  With that said, I'm sure this store must serve certain customer base.  The guys working behind the counter seems knowledgeable. Also this place sells some multicm and a-tacs camo for airsoft kids.   My cusotmer wanted American military surplus jacket to bring home, and I managed to find one that he wanted.   Pricing is okay, compare to on-line shops this is about average. For surplus some items were cheap, some items were over priced.
5 Great staff! Fun stuff! Something new everyday. I highly recommend this place whether you need supplies for the military, love hunting, or need costumes for a play.
5 Great group of guys! I went in hoping to get some replicas of my grandfather's military medals for his funeral. Two of the employees went above and beyond to help us out! Not only did they read through his discharge paperwork to figure out what we needed, but put them together for us so we were ready to go! Great customer service! Cool place with lots of military knowledge and gear! I would definitely return!
5 Great store! They have a huge selection of surplus items. They had exactly what I was looking for and it was made by a very high quality and well known manufacturer. Thanks for having exactly what I needed when I needed it!
