5 Costco sells pretty much everything I need at reasonable prices. Don't need to repeat that. What makes this Costco special is the Kirkland Signature car wash. For $7.99 you get an environmentally friendly clean that even works well with my convertible roof. If you've got a dirty vehicle, this is the place to go. My car now shines like it was new.
5 Costco is THE shopping place.  Clothing, food, household items, furniture, medicine, gasoline and a car wash....a one stop shopping extravaganza.  I spend way too much money, but they have the highest quality at the most reasonable prices.  Get the American Express Card and you can earn anywhere from 1 - 3% back up to $500.00.  The BEST thing about Costco is their return policy.
5 Yes Costco can get crazy busy but there is a reason for this. Costco has great products, great prices and great customer service. If they loose any of these qualities I will drop their membership in a heart beat but until then I am very happy to stay a member of Costco.
