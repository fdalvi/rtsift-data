1 As much as I would like to endorse a small, local business I had a fairly disappointing experience with Bill's Key Shop on University Ave. Apparently because the now bankrupt Saturn manufacturers were difficult to deal with, it's perfectly okay to be completely uncooperative and rude to a Saturn owner.   And this was following an email exchange where I was clear about the make and model of my car before I went out of my day to visit their shop.  I did find someone else who was happy to have my business instead.
5 I was locked out of my son's apartment. I lost the key somewhere in the blding. could not find it. Called Bill's Key shop, and it was just about 6:00 pm. Someone arrived within 10-15 mins. had the door unlocked within minutes. All was good! The gentleman was very nice, didn't take advantage of the situation. I had asked for charge up front to know what I was getting into, and he stuck to his price. Hopefully you won't need their service, but if you do, rest assured you are in good hands!
5 Prompt for an evening lock-out, stuck by his quoted price, which was WAY lower than another company I called, polite guy and no hassle.
