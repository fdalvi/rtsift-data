5 Grand opening tomorrow. They had a soft opening on New Year's Eve. I was presently surprised at how lovely the place was on the inside. It's dimly lit and makes for an intimate experience. They have a GREAT selection on the buffet for anyone's taste; several options for vegetarians and meat lovers. They even had biriyani on the buffet line, which I am a big fan of.   The place is very spacious and has a contemporary layout with soothing music playing. It makes you feel like you are really in a high end restaurant, but you realize that it's a high end buffet with great food instead. I'm told they will offer a full bar in the near future which is unique for an establishment like this.  I had no complaints. The staff were accommodating and received prompt service. I will definitely be back.   I just need to work off the 20k+ calories I just injected into my body first after I take a much needed nap. Not smart planning on my apart considering it's the evening of New Years Eve. Oh well. We live and learn.
5 Absolutely delicious!!! Would highly recommend it to anyone!
3 This was a very pretty Indian restaurant in a not SO good location.  The food was good, as was the service.  However the portions were extremely small and the prices were high for what we got.   Our recommendation for Indian is Mount Everest.  Good portions, quality, service  and the right price for us!
5 Lunch buffet was only $9.99! The best quoalit and great selection.  I want to try dinner soon.  Love it!  :)
5 One word, delicious.  If you can read more than one word, then read on my friend cause this is one of the best Indian restaurants that I've been to.   Some hobknobs might find the location a bit shady, but the interior of the restaurant is clean and well put together and makes you forget about all the bums across the street. Whataraya gonna do? Amirite?  This place has only been opened a week or so. The service here was good. While the waiters were new and seemed untrained in the usual customer service/waiter chatter, (family owned restaurant I assume?), they were still very polite and attentive, and boxed our food to-go for us. No complaints from me, they refilled my water glass often as I slew down all that spicy curry.  Good news for all vegetarians, half the menu is vegetarian based, which put me in a chipper mood right off the bat when we entered. They also have multiple chicken and lamb entrees if you're still craving the meat food. For me not actually being a big fan of curry, the food was amazing and I ate till I was beyond stuffed. I forgot the names of the dishes we selected, but I had a nine vegatable combo with mild spicy creme curry and my boyfriend had the traditional chicken curry. Both were just right in hotness and didn't leave a chalky taste in my mouth like most curry does.  The grand finaleeeee....Naan bread. mmm yes, that's right. the garlic naan bread here is so delicious I just wanted to go adopt a new puppy or something. Was so good that I got another frisbee shaped bread slice to-go.  With all that and an extra bowl of rice, the price for two was pretty decent. We ate there during the dinner hours where they gave us a menu, but they also do a lunch buffet which I have yet to try. I plan on coming back here as this place has awakened my curry craving. I'm getting hungry just typing about it.
5 I was there for dinner yesterday , the place it's called Delhi Indian Cuisine . I have a amazing experience !! I am pretty good fan of indian food , I have been to almost every Indian restaurant in Vegas , but the one I was there yesterday , there is no  comparison with any other  indian restaurant . Ammazzzzingggg food , ammmazzzzzzingggg service , ammmmazzzzingggggg decoration  , oh my god ,, all the waiter and waitress were so friendly and polite , I have a amazing experience  having dinner there . It was a fairly new restaurant , not too many people know that place , it's slightly off the strip about two miles,  but its really worth going there . Lastly, If you like indian food and if you haven't been to Delhi Indian Cuisine , you really missing something ,,,, No more words for this I just want to say Wowwww
5 Where shall I begin, food is excellent, nice atmosphere, service is great. The staff is very friendly and informative for first timers to Indian cuisine. The chicken tikka masala was my favorite dish, along with the yellow fried rice.
5 Tandoori chicken is to die for!!! Service is very nice but not hovering. Glad it is so close to the UNLV campus. Bread came out hot and fresh. Will definitely be back again!!
5 I went to the this place for lunch with my wife and my son . When I went there , I was really surprised with the decoration inside . And the buffet wow, it's the largest Indian buffet in Las Vegas so far ,, so many varieties in the buffet , they have the largest selection of vegetarian and non- veg items , and the price wow, ,, just under $10 . Waiter and servers are so friendly and polite ,, great customer service ,, I am really glad conning here ,, highly recommended ,, Great service !!! Great Food , definitely going back soon .
4 (Review of buffet only)  Interesting choice of location to set up a new Indian buffet on the east side of town considering you have Mint, India Masala, Origin India, Gandhi, and Taste of India all within a 2 mile radius, although I think it's the others that should be intimidated, since the new kid in town has got some bhangra swagger.  Pretty much all of its rivals are in little strip malls of varying degrees of  decay, so this should not deter you in terms of its exterior.  Once you step inside, the modern decor with track lighting, single open room layout, and seemingly endless linear display of offerings along the buffet line should set your mind at ease.    Upon being seated, you are immediately prompted if you would like naan bread with your buffet.  Not only should you say yes, but you should specifically request the garlic naan since the aroma alone with the freshly minced garlic and finishing brush of ghee emanating from the freshly cut bread removed from the tandoori oven is intoxicating enough to get your appetite revved up on the feast that lies ahead (refills are complimentary if you need more)  As one approaches the buffet line, the first wave of offerings include various meats including the standards such tandoori, tikki masala, and curry chicken along with some wild cards such as goat curry and reshmi kababs, which is a ground chicken meatball that seems a bit healthier than the sauced meats.   The latter half of the line offers a multitude of vegetarian offerings including saag paneer (spinach), chana masala (spicy stewed chickpeas), eggplant, mixed curry veggies, and lentils.  The third category of offerings is the carbs, which in this case included plain basmati, a spicy chicken biryani, mini-samosas (which gives you more of the flaky crust to enjoy, much like why mini-pecan pies are superior to regular pecan pie), idli (a steamed rice cake), and something I've never seen before, a spongy savory cake called dhokla, which I've read to be a beloved street snack in the southern part of India.  It has a cornbread-like consistency, a rich yellow hue from turmeric and mustard seeds, and is served with some chili peppers, cilantro, and toasted coriander seeds.  Add a dollop of tamarind, and it is a pretty addictive combo of flavors which I would have had more of had I not discovered it at the end of my meal.    I almost never have room for desserts after an Indian buffet but it is a rotating mix of gulab jamun(sweet milk balls), rice pudding, gajar halwa (carrots+milk), and a few offerings of fruit which I am always a bit wary of when it comes to buffets in general.    Service was very good in which plates were cleared and water was refilled efficiently, and the staff checked in a few times to see how I was enjoying the meal.  Compared to the local competition, price point is excellent (9.99 vs 10.99 at India Masala, and 12 and up at Mint and Gandhi), quality of food is definitely in my top 3 in Vegas (Mount Everest and Taj Palace), and highlights include the garlic naan, balance in offerings between vegetarian and meat dishes,  a few unique offerings (mini samosas and dhokla), and ambiance.  India Masala is still my go-to choice for take out buffet due to quantity (refer to my review for my patented packing technique) as well as complimentary Mango Lassi with yelp check-in, but if I'm dining in, Delhi Indian is my new go-to place for quality when I plan to go on an Indian carb feeding frenzy for lunch.
4 Finally an Indian buffet I can go to. Wide spread..lot of choices both in vegetarian as well as non vegetarian food......clean ambience, good service, decent price.
5 Thank you yelp once again! While roaming the streets of LV, I got the craving for some food from the homeland. After some bad experiences with lunch indian buffets in the past here, my hopes were pretty low.  I have to say I'm vegetarian so while many may love indian buffets with great meat options, I usually am stuck with like two non-appetizing vegetarian options. Not the case here!! The buffet was huge! Filled up half the restaurant! And the food was delicious!! Naan-amazing Samosas- to die for! (I ate like 3) Korma- almost fell out of my chair! Even the dal was good!
3 It was just OK. Ive definitely had better Indian food before (not in Vegas but back home in the UK).  Lets just say, I wont be ordering from here again lol. I ordered a Lamb curry/biriyani
2 Okay so I just don't get the hype. I was really excited - I mean Indian, buffet, good reviews, sounds like a recipe for success. It was okay... and cheaper than other places at $9.99. But I think I would pay the extra few dollars and go a block over to Mint in a heart beat. Yes the buffet takes up length wise over half the restaurant, but what I didn't care for about this place was that it lacked variety - you have the standard Tandoori chicken, Tikka Masala etc.  But maybe it was a busy day before I got there giving them the benefit of the doubt, but I had to fish around in the sauce to find pieces of chicken and not only in the tikki masala but any dish which contained sauce and meat. Don't get me wrong I love sauce, but I like to find that there is ample meat to accompany my sauce.   Also, there was something about the ambience that felt cold - maybe it was the poor acoustics which made it feel very big and open but not in a good way or the just the set up but somehow the dining room was not overly inviting. Although, that in itself is not something that would normally concern me - hey if the food is superb I'll eat it sitting on a street corner (as used to be the case with Viva Las Arapas before they moved). Nonetheless, I thought it is something that should be noted.   Service was average, nothing outstanding. We did request garlic naan and they brought it. My friend asked for lemon wedges for water, they forgot, had to ask again and then they brought a plate of lime wedges from the salad bar.. maybe they don't have lemons?   On the upside I got a free Mango Lassi which was tasty with Yelp check in - so thank you Delhi Indian Cuisine for that treat. So overall I wish them good luck and I hope that they make it as I do with all restaurants that are not chains but unfortunately I am going to stay loyal to Mint for lunch buffet, and Mt. Everest as a second choice.
5 I was craving Indian food so I came here based on recommendations on yelp. the place including the bathroom is very clean. staff is super friendly and nice. the food was excellent. I tried everything on the buffet and they were all tasty. I especially loved the goat curry but I love curry in general. when u sit be sure to ask for garlic naan.  I was searching for saag paneer but it was displayed so I asked and they said they had run out but they made a small bowl for me. it was excellent as well. the buffet is only available for lunch and they temporarily close from 3-5pm so they can change for dinner. I think I found my Indian lunch buffet place. oh it's $10 which is cheaper than other places. I'd definitely be back for sure!!!
5 I must say this by far is my favorite go to restaurant. I love the staff and how clean the place is. The chef is amazing and so very known by a lot! I'm totally impressed by how put together it is. I'm thankful my boyfriend introduced me to this place :) My co workers are too sharing their love for the restaurant. I wish them all the luck and success!
5 Good ambience and good food. The owner was very nice and so was the staff we reached there at 10:30 and they did not rush us at over all a good place to eat Indian food
5 Fantastic as always. I decided to mostly eat the vegetarian dishes today. Saag paneer, chana masala, yellow dal. Mmmmm mmmm mmmm. It was fantastic. The veggie Palau rice was also incredible. My favorite buffet appetizer are the samosas and the bread as usual was fluffy and delicious. Today I tried their Chai Masala and was very impressed. Not overly sweet, but just enough sweetness to compliment the tea. Thanks Delhi!!!
5 Good service. Nice selection. Flavorful. Generous naan portions. I was happy with them. Reasonable price too. Strong competition to India palace.
4 Just thinking about the place made me hungry .It`s 11 PM so probably too late for the buffet .But anyway ,Vegas local ,frequent visitor to the Indian buffet and have been to most in town .Yes that crazy ! I started going to this place about 2 months ago , had a gigantic biryani and mango lassi , the chef specializes in the Mango lassi as far as I am concerned! Fan ever since . First time I went there for the buffet , the garlic bread , the mushroom were fantastic , not to mention the chicken and mutton .I had a feast , no pun intended . Only regret that day was, maybe  I shouldn`t have eaten that much .But by another 3 days the regret vanished and i duly returned ,this time ,they had another special variety of chicken , I am blanking on the name , but i was good , if you end up there just look and sausage like chicken roll,it`s really good .  When I am not going to this one ,I am probably going to some other one :) .Imagine the embarrassment at showing up at the same buffet ,every other day ! And have to say most of them are similarly priced and probably have similar food range ,but after multiple sampling at other indian buffets I have to say that this one has more options,maybe a little bit cleaner and definitely the most spacious  in town. And would recommend it to anyone who wants to get away from ridiculously priced buffet at the big nightclub restaurants , as long as you like indian food . As for the negative stuffs , the ambience could be better , i mean they could decorate the walls a little bit better and play some decent music like some upscale places.Sometimes they have hard time catching up with the demand supply thing but i guess this being a new place ,its something they can work on.And  yes sometimes ,there is just that little extra oil floating around in the nan-bread or the curries, again something they can work on .All in all ,for an indian buffet ,it`s bang for bucks. And no I don`t own the place and have nothing against any other Indian buffets.
5 Four words: bang for your buck. For $9.00 you get amazing food! And when you're in Vegas surrounded by steak buffets offering powdered mashed potatoes, this is a great deal. What this place lacked in ambience, it made up for in taste. It's relatively new with a great culinary future ahead.  The owner was very sweet. He personally brought over the free mango lassi I got from checking in (delicious, might I add).  If you're feeling your pockets empty because the strip is just too darn expensive, then hop on over to the outskirts of main vegas attractions and scoop up your desired heaps of savory, succulent, mouth-watering (affordable) Indian food. Seriously though, go go go.
5 I was like you once. Looking on yelp for the best indian food option. Knowing that these places on the strip weren't worth their prices but wondering what other joints still offer good food, good service, and nice atmosphere (because, hey, you're vacationing in Vegas and you don't need to be slumming it at some filthy ethnic place to save $10 you'll just lose on a side bet anyways). Well, this is the answer. Do not look at any other reviews because New Dehli is where you want to go.  Just a few months old, it has a slew of positive reviews and -- as great as the food was (there is a mango lassi free with your check in that you MUST get) -- the pride the staff/owners put into the restaurant is apparent with every detail of the restaurant. From the decor to the menu to the EXCELLENT service, New Dehli is what comes to mind (for me, at least) when we talk about "shopping local". This is their restaurant and I saw in my visit that the owners truly care about this place. These folks took out a space in a shopping center (plenty of parking!) and have created a truly sincere dining experience. Maybe it's not something I can explain well -- but if you'd like to understand, swing by New Dehli on a Thursday evening and take in the experience. Never have a rooted this hard for a restaurant in a city I've only been visiting.
5 Lunch buffet was awesome! Very large selection of items, vegetarian and non-vegetarian alike.   Naan bread is brought to your table fresh from the oven, so no problem of dried out (or missing) naan in the buffet line like some other places. As if you need another reason to wolf down warm deliciousness...ask for the garlic naan, mmmmmm, you won't be sorry.  We ended our meal with one of my favorite things - a cup of real chai tea ($2/cup). If you have  never had it, you have to add your own sweetener, which is nice because you can adjust it to your liking (and you don't have to use real sugar if you prefer artificial sweeteners).  I would have to say this is one of the best Indian buffets I have had in Vegas. We left full and happy, without feeling heavy (other buffets we've visited often had overly oily items and this one did not). I also think that for the quality and selection of items, they could actually charge a couple dollars more and still be a bargain. We will definitely be back!  note to owners:  I wish you offered some kind of drink menu. Not only would customers would know what kind of drink options were available for purchase, it would also give your business the opportunity for additional revenue during the lunch buffet time.
1 Never order for delivery!! Ordered and they never showed up. Don't know how the food taste because I never received it.
5 Went for dinner, it was delicious! I had the Vegetarian Thali and my babe had the Butter Chicken. My Thali came with regular naan but we ordered additional garlic naan and both were tasty. We had plenty of leftovers, there was so much food! Service was great, really friendly.
5 This place has opened two months ago and hence doesn't appear on google maps. But dont let that get into your way for this awesome north indian treat. I like the owner n staff who are very polite and attentive to their customers. The food is of high quality and is priced reasonably. My pick would be the traditional style chicken curry and would recommend it to everyone.
4 Order my food to go... BEST CHICKEN CURRY!! My new favorite place. I love Indian food!! Glad this place is open!! I've been waiting to eat here. The ambiance is really nice as well. Look forward to trying their buffet!!
5 Passing through Las Vegas, found this place on Yelp! Amazing experience! Food was fantastic, fresh, plentiful and diverse and each dish had its own, unique flavor. Staff was friendly and provided excellent service. The establishment was also clean and well maintained.      Will not pass through without another visit!
4 I kinda get what another reviewer meant when she said the buffet is quite large, yet lacked variety. Everything was pretty great though; I love that they aren't as afraid of adding a little bit of heat to their buffet dishes (most places avoid heat in buffet items, for obvious reasons).   I also thought the garlic naan was wonderful, hot and fresh from the kitchen. They brought it out pretty late into our meal, which brings me to the service. Not bad, but a little slow. Understandable, as they haven't been open long, and not a huge deal. Just looks like they might still be working out a couple of kinks perhaps?  I would definitely return, for the buffet, and possibly for dinner if the mood strikes.
5 I swear, I walked 40 mins from the hotel to this resturant just to eat the buffet.  Delhi Indian cuisine is by bar the most delicious and cheapest buffet in Las Vegas . The owner was super nice and friendly.  Everything from the quality of food, service, atmosphere, cleanliness, large variety  Was perfect.  I am from San Francisco but I haven't had such a tasty biryani in my life.
1 Can't give minus stars, so starting with one star.  This is my first review ever and thought it might be helpful for anybody walking in with family and small hungry kids.  Service was so poor that one of the starters (chicken soup) was delivered after 35 min and the other starter (Pani Puri) after 40 min. Not to mention that the Pani puri shells were stale and smelled/tasted bad.  Food was delivered after one hour and don't even want to discuss how it was.  One of the servers realized and offered us gulab jamun, appreciate that, but fact is fact and if you are hungry and with impatient kids, please look somewhere else.
5 After reading so many reviews, my BF and I finally tried this place out last week. We had the lunch buffet, and I was surprised by the variety of the different foods. Of course our first question to the owner was if the meat is halal or not, and it was!! *halal alert*   The food was delicious, everything from the reshmi kabob to the warm gajar ka halwa. They had chicken tandoori (flavorful!), goat biryani, channa masala, and the list can keep going on and on. We also ordered garlic naan (including in the 10$ buffet price) and it honestly seemed to come right out of the oven! I couldn't get enough of the chicken tikka masala, and the Navrata korma (I think that's the name? LOL). The sauce (Salan) was creamy and hot.   It became obvious that this place is going to be very popular VERY soon. We talked to the owner, and he was very helpful. He told us that although the main items stay the same during the lunch buffet, sometimes the dessert (mithai) might change, and maybe the lentil curry (daal).   The atmosphere of the restaurant was quite fancy and quiet on the day that we went... But they have a very nice setup.   I'm itching to come back again! :)   SPECTACULAR place!! MUST GO.
5 Excellent lunch buffet. They had a good spread for vegetarians as well. The owner was nice and came by the table many times to check on us. Much better than other Indian fares on the strip -- similar taste but much better price and service.
4 Tried it once so far. Loved the lunch buffet. Check-in offer at the time of this review is still one free soda or lassi, which is a cool bonus for what is already a great deal ($9.99 lunch buffet).  Impressed by the gingery Dal Tadka, and the savory and slightly sweet Navratan (veggie) Korma. They were cool with making us Roti (whole wheat) instead of regular Naan, and I thought the size of the Tandoori Chicken pieces was encouraging. Smaller chicken pieces indicate less hormones, and a more expensive bird. It's the first dish you will see on the buffet, and is a good representation of the rest of it. Quality ingredients made with care in quantity - these are some of the largest chafing dishes you will see on a Indian buffet, ever!  Looking forward to the next visit, and hopefully an upgrade to a string of *red* stars.  Way to go, Delhi! Keep it up please!
5 Simply the best service! So friendly and sincere & the food was too notch. I was so excited I forgot to take a picture of the presentation but it least I took one of the aftermath..... So good I couldn't finish it all. I will be back for sure and will mark this as one of my favorite spots.
5 My husband and I came here for dinner our first night in Vegas.  Our dinner was so delicious that we decided to come back again the next night! This was the best Indian food we have had compared to places in San Francisco and Sacramento, CA. It has delicious food, great service and good prices. The restaurant is also nice and clean. The Tandoori Chicken was fresh and sizzling when it came to our table. The meat was tender and falling off the bones! We also had the Lamb Curry, Chicken Curry, and Chicken Tikka Masala. All of the curries were amazing with just the right amount of spices. The staff was friendly and accommodating. We will definitely be coming back here when we visit Vegas!
5 Great food, great service. Make sure to get garlic Naan. I'll definitely go back for some more. I sample a little bit of everything, but my favorite was goat curry by far. Plus you can't beat the price around $10.00 dollars for their lunch buffet .!
3 Recently dined here for the lunch buffet hoping to find the best Indian food in Vegas. Greatly disappointed. Being originally from the Bay Area, I've ate at some really fantastic Indian/Pakistani restaurants. Haven't found one in vegas yet.   The staff was very friendly and the Garlic Naan was really good. However, allot of the food tasted bland and lacked flavor altogether. The chicken curry lacked chicken and the flavor of the yogurt was overwhelming. The Saag, Samosa's and the Dal lacked flavor. The pakoras tasted stale and the rice in the Biryani was over cooked.   The only two things good were the Garlic Naan and the desert, Galub Jamun. I see all the great reviews so maybe I just came on a day when the cook wasn't feeling it.
4 Excellent lunch buffet. Chicken biriyani, garlic naan, and chicken makhani are what I would recommend. Everything is good though. Cheap and reasonable price, can't go wrong with that. I hope this place gets more business.
4 As I said before, I would travel to find a good value for the price and this place did not disappoint. After speaking with the management, I learned that they have only been open since January 2014. This place is legit, new and clean. When you walk in the place opens up and the interior design is simple and clean looking. I went for their lunch buffet and it was only $9.99. Not a bad price as there are probably a plethora of Indian cuisine in one square mile. The buffet had a variety of foods: Lots of curry chicken, kabob, and goat, ton of veggie curries, the naan was fresh, and they had two desserts. I would have given them a five star but the salad bar area was weak and they ran out of vegetable samoasa. The servers are extremely welcoming and nice. Anyways, I will definitely be back and bring some friends. Good to have another option for Indian food.
5 Have to say this food is better than Mint Indian Bistro. Sorry guys. Great great Food!!
4 This place has great food for the price (lunch buffet).  It is not a disappointment either on selection.  They actually had one of my favorites which have been difficult to find in a buffet, vegetable samosa...very yummy.  Unlike a lot of Indian places, the food was not too salty.  Definitely will be a repeat customer.
5 Out for past 11 days and was tired of eating burgers and pizza, we wanted to have Indian food. While browsing yelp, we stumbled upon this place. Dinner was great, service was also good. Next day we tried their lunch buffet, and it was even better than last night's dinner. Lots of option, great taste and overall great service. I would recommend this place to my Friends visiting Vegas.
5 This is definitely as good as it gets. The lunch buffet was first class. Can't imagine how anyone could rate this less than 5 stars. I've been to many indian restaurants all over the world (including india) and this was as good as the best. The food was so good it could have passed for an indian wedding. The biryani (my favorite) was perfect, as was everything else. I hope this place stays around for awhile! One thing I was suprised was that they didn't have a dinner buffet any night of the week, if you are the restaurant we would love to see this!
5 Great food and great people! The hosts were wrapping up when we walked in but they still accommodated us. We went with a simple order of jeera rice and chicken curry with beverages and raita. The food was original to the Indian palate. The hosts were possibly the best I've met! Must check it out if you have an Indian craving in Vegas
5 My sister and I we were craving Indian food for dinner , I've been to mint, Mt . Everest, Indian oven.. hands down we found the best one yet, Delhi Indian Cuisine is truly the best. And the setting is great, Hari the one who help us was awesome. Don't think twice about it, eat  and enjoy..
4 **Summary**        - Value - This is probably the cheapest Indian buffet in town.        - Quality - This ranks as one of the top Indian buffets I've had. Moist chicken/goat and good curry. What more can you ask for?        - Service - They're absent from the front a lot of times, but when they do come over, they're very friendly.        - Asian Influence - They have chow mein and chili chicken. I guess it adds variety, lol. **Price**        - Lunch Buffet $9.99 **Ordered**        - Garlic Naan - I suggest requesting the garlic naan or they might give you the regular naan instead.        - Tandori Chicken - Flavorful as ever cooked in a clay oven.        - Chili Chicken - One of their Asian tasting entrees. It wasn't too spicy. A little salty from the sauce, but good otherwise.        - Chicken Makhani - Chicken + Curry + Butter = Delicious. The chicken wasn't too dry and the curry was as buttery delicious as ever.        - Chicken Saag - I prefer the makhani, but this adds variety to my plate.        - Goat Curry - The goat is fall off the bone tender. A must try. **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice lunch Indian buffet. It's a great deal!
5 Awesome and affordable food, good service and family friendly . What else u need? I will come again to try other entrees . They have 9.99 buffet with endless choices .
5 I've been to several Indian restaurants here in Vegas and this one is definitely the best I've had. The garlic naan is chewy and delicious. Also, so many great vegetarian choices on the lunch buffet which is a very reasonable $9.99. The staff is extremely sweet and they provide great service!
5 Enjoyed a delicious dinner here. Can't wait to come again and enjoy the lunch buffet. Chicken tikka was fabulous as was the chicken kadhai. Okra masala was delicious.   I suggest you give the kashmiri naan a try.  It was to die for.
5 The buffet is only $9.99 and the food is great.  I have been to many of the other buffets in town and this is probably the best.   Add in the free drink with check in and u can't beat it.  This is my go-to place for indian food.
5 I'm new to vegas and was looking for an Indian restaurant.  The food was delicious and the service was great!   Bonus for the free mango lassi!  Huge selection of food.  Nice atmosphere and convenient location.
4 Delhi Indian Cuisine has been on my radar for quite some time. I've seen the high reviews and wanted to check this place out. I'm so glad that I did because the food here rocks! (my socks).  The lunch buffet starts at 11:00am and goes until 3:00pm. It is one of the better priced Indian buffets in town at 9.99. I came in and ordered the lunch buffet. The dining room is very clean and spacious. There is a large buffet area which is loaded with tons of food.  The yelp check in offer was for either a soda or one of their house made lassi's, basically, a yogurt smoothie. They have a sweet one, a salty one, and a mango one. I ordered the mango. It was SOOO good. The flavor was very mango-ey and it was silky smooth and had a nice mouthfeel from the yogurt.  As for the food, I would recommend anything! I especially liked their chicken, all of their versions of them were super tender. The goat stew was especially tasty as well. It wasn't too gamey and the sauce on it was fabulous! There wasn't anything on the menu that I didn't like.  One thing that I thought was kinda weak was their garlic naan. I found the taste to be a little bit bland. And for their noodle, milk dessert was a little bit too sweet.  Service was also kinda questionable. They seemed to start out pretty slow with taking our orders and getting our drinks, and after our first round of dishes they didn't clear our plates fast enough so that we were stacking our plates on top of each other. But, they were quicker at bussing our table during the middle of our dining experience.  Would I come back? Oh, you know it, because I loves me some Indian food. And the food here is delicious, fresh, and tasty. And try the mango lassi, it's really good.
5 I love Indian food and I've been to several Indian restaurants on and off the strip so I was very delighted when my friend told me of Delhi's Indian buffet. I'm usually a little disappointed with the small portions at the Indian restaurants so I thought the buffet would be a good change.   I was very very pleased with my experience. The selection was great and the food tasted very good. I haven't had vegetable pakoras that tasted as good as the ones they serve here. I tried goat curry for the first time and was impressed. The chicken tandoori and chicken biryani were just as delicious. I also tried these dough balls in syrup called Gulab Jamun and although the texture was a little weird at first the flavor was exceptional. The server suggested I try it with the rice pudding and it tasted even better!   I have nothing but positive things to say about this place. The service was prompt and friendly and you cannot beat the price of $9.99! My bf said we're not going anywhere else for Indian food. We have definitely found a gem!
5 Delicious. My mom wanted Indian food, and she couldn't stop raving about how everything tasted. The Lassi deal for checking in was pretty sweet too. It sucks that it's off the main tourist hub, which means you'll need a cab to get there, but it was definitely worth it.
5 Well appointed great service and amazing food. Make sure that you get garlic naan. Had the lunch buffet. The chicken makkani ( which I would compare to chicken tikki masala) melts in your mouth. The goat curry falls off the bone. Everything was Great!
5 We had a very good time here, the service was excellent. Our waiter (Krishna) took really good care of us.  They have a great variety of vegetarian as well as non veg.  If you are into non veg I would highly recommend the tandoori chicken, it was juicy and spicy and very well cooked.  The Navratan kurma was wonderful and the shaai paneer was great.  The kulfi is homemade so definitely try that,  it was great.
5 We came in later in the evening.   The staff was very patient and helpful.  The food was delicious!!!   No wonderful this restaurant has good reviews.  Chicken Vindaloo was very flavorful ( medium spicy).  The Tikka chicken was also delicious. It came on a sizzling plate.   Yes, you want to come here.
5 Very clean.  Friendly staff.  Food tastes great.  All this for 9.99.  We'll be back over and over again.  Dont forget to try the garlic naan.
4 If I rated it on the food flavor alone, I would give it five stars. What's holding me back is the casual racism exhibited by the owners.   If you don't think white people can handle spicy food, just don't ask us how spicy they want it. Make us think you only offer it one way. But that's not what you did. You specifically asked how spicy I wanted my Vindaloo. I said, "Very spicy." You looked at me like I was crazy, and asked again. I said, "Indian spicy", hoping that magical keyword would convince you. No, instead, you looked me in the eye and asked if it was for someone else. Had I not been ready to rob a bank for a Vindaloo, I would have left right then, but, at this point, I was committed. So, thinking that you finally were going to give me what I asked, I let it go, and we ordered the rest of our stuff.   The Vindaloo's spice level was somewhere between yogurt and a milk shake. Granted, it had a fantastic flavor, as did the Tikka Masala, the Mahkane, and the Saag Paneer. The Kashmir Naan was so delicious it brought a tear to my eye, and the Galub Jamun was top-notch. In fact, the only thing missing from my night of Indian food bliss was some vague tingle; some heat to let me know that I had eaten some spices. It was just not there.    I'll definitely order from here again, but I need to know what secret code I can give you so that you'll actually put some heat in my Vindaloo.
5 Awesome food choices . the spice level was good as well . Very neat and clean . very helpfull staff . The Gajjar halwa and kheer were simply amazing .  we went for buffet they had good choices for both veg and non veg  and a lot of items for both. garlic naan and chowmein were also very very good. i would definetly recommend them to all my friends and family visting Vegas .
5 By far the best food during my Vegas stay. I spent two weeks vacationing in Vegas and went to several restaurants everyday.   For dinner I had a yellow curry lamb dish is in my top three rated dishes of life. The chicken masala was the best that I've had. This place's lunch buffet easily beat out caesars palace buffet and was a fourth the cost. This place's lunch buffet easily beat out caesars palace buffet and was a fourth the cost. I I will eat here anytime I'm in Vegas.
5 Service: 5 Stars  Food: 5 Stars (well, I really like the goat curry, garlic naan, Khir...) Ambience: 5 Stars  Yelp check in: free lassi/soda  What more can I say?  Just try it for yourself!
5 Excellent food! Warm people and patient service. The entire family loved their custom flavored and spiced menu. Any days choice!! Go and meet Krishna. He loves people coming to this place and serving them with lot of affection.
5 One of the best buffets in town.  Very affordable for lunch ($9.99) for quality Indian food and fresh baked naan.  What a bargain.  Definitely coming back.
4 One of the good Indian restaurants in Vegas. Good food and descently priced. Lunch buffet was really good.
5 Great food! First time coming here and the owner greeted us at the door and made us feel very comfortable. Great variety and the price was on point! Would recommend to anyone.
5 I have been to 4 other Indian buffets in Vegas but none of them made me crave their food as badly as this place.   The service here is not always the best but it's getting better in recent months. You may need to wait a little longer to get their attention especially if you don't look Indian. I don't really care because their food compensates for everything else.   My favorite buffet dish is Malai Kofta. Just dip your fresh naan bread in it and you will know what I mean. Kebabs are also really good.   They tend to rotate their buffet dishes throughout the week but removing Malai Kofta on certain days is the crime against the part of humanity they made addicted to it!
5 what a treat!! ...tried other indian restaurants here in town ... but none were as good as this place..plenty of different dishes. we had the lunch buffet  and it was so good my daughter wants to go back every day!! .... we will go again next week
5 Wow- my husband and I are vegetarians from phoenix who love indian food, and we loved this place!   The food was very flavorful and colorful - some unique items. It was presented elegantly, with a good selection of alcoholic beverages.   Also, the owner came to our table and was very polite, asking us if there was anything we needed.   Don't usually eat much dairy, but we got the free mango lassi and it was to die for!   Definitely check this place out! It's HUGE so it would be great for big parties. Good atmosphere with lots of natural light.
5 Excellent. Food was spicy and well prepared. Atmosphere was nice. The place was extremely clean. I'll definitely be back.
4 I'm a foodie for Indian and many places in town do not have the variety as Delhi Indian. Their selections are vegan friendly, meat, and they even have some salad/desert bar. The service was by far the best, staff is very friendly and accommodating. Looking forward to my next visit.
5 Fantastic! We went to the lunch buffet and they have the largest selection of dishes for vegetarians like us, (don't worry there were plenty of meat options for you carnivorous types.)  And the customer service was out of this world! We felt like we got the royal treatment, we had a couple special requests and were accommodated graciously, I have to say this may be our new favorite indian restaurant in Las Vegas!
5 Great Food!!! You won't be disappointed. My favorites are the chicken Biryani and Chicken Curry. Love the flavor and spice. Great atmosphere and ambience. I will definitely come back for more.
5 i like their selections..from curries and vegetables! this is a hidden indian food away from the strip
4 I wanted to try this lunch buffet since reading some friends' reviews and I went today.  It's taken the #1 spot in the Indian lunch buffet spot with one restaurant yet to go.  I was there early, about 11;15, and I was the first person in the restaurant.   There soon were several other customers.  It's a very large room with lots of tables laid out well and the buffet is a large area opposite the entrance.  With a check in on Yelp, you get either a mango lassi or a soda free.  It's a good deal for merely checking in.  I ordered garlic naan and then headed to the buffet.  The naan was good but I wish it had more of a garlic flavor.  For the first plate, I had chicken Biryani, a couple vegetable pakoras, a vegetable samosa, a piece of tandoori chicken, some chili chicken, soya badi, and some saag paneer.  Everything I had was very good and I noticed that almost all dishes had a spiciness that I liked.  Of these, the weakest dishes was the saag paneer.  The crust of the samosa was flaky and the filling was very good.  The soya badi was quite good.  For my second plate, I had squash, Navratan korma, chicken curry, and chana masala.  All of these were very good save the squash which was a little nondescript.  I also tried some of their raita which was good.  The chicken curry didn't have very much of a curry flavor but when the juices from the chana masala mixed with the curry juice, it became much better.  Finally, I went back and got one idli and put a small amount of tamarind chutney on it.  It had a soft texture and was good.  I was a but disappointed that they had no dhokla.  I had read Christopher S.' review and I was interested in trying something different.  Overall, this is a very solid buffet and moves to the top tier of Indian restaurants.  The price is now $10.99 but that's still very good considering the wide choice you have with their large buffet.  Service was very good!  Several times, someone stopped by to see how things were.  A woman stopped once and asked me if it was too spicy so they know that they spice their foods.  Plates were cleared before I came back each time.  This is another stop for after hiking when we go to an Indian buffet.  It's a great addition to the Indoian dining in Las Vegas.
4 Solid lunch buffet for $11/person- clean and organized display with all item labeled, naan available by request with garlic, and free mango lassi with Yelp check-in.  Cucumber, onion, and tamarind-sauce salad is refreshing and delicious. Goat curry is meaty with good heat to it, tandoori chicken, curry chicken, chili chicken, and biryani rice all available. Vegetarian options included samosas, pekora, chana masala, dal, and squash, along with saag paneer. The salad section also has a phenomenal mint sauce that goes deliciously with absolutely everything- I'd buy this stuff to go if I could (I didn't ask). Finished up with the gulab jamun, my favorite dessert of milk-cheese balls soaked in honey sauce.  I liked that the variety of the buffet was fairly diverse with a lot of lighter and vegetarian options, allowing me to sample a little of everything without totally pigging out. Service was polite and soft-spoken, we were asked repeatedly if we liked our food, which was appreciated.  Having moved here from the Bay area, with about 234920349 times more Indian restaurant options to pick from, I simply wish I didn't have to cross town to find this cuisine.
5 Best Indian food ever. We tired almost all Indian restaurants in and around Vegas and this is the outstanding one. Sumptuous food, warm welcoming, and quick service are their attractions... I recommend everyone to try food here when you visit Vegas
4 Pretty good! The buffet is good and has a lot of vegetarian options. They could definitely spice up the options a bit (after all, most people who want Indian food want spicy food) and they could definitely mellow out on the salt. Way too salty!   Very friendly service. It's also a lot nicer, bigger, and cleaner than you would guess from the outside.   I'll be back :)
