3 Good prices, cheap gas, but I wouldn't trust the meat here.
1 Customer service is horrible. It seems that if you need something you better go find it yourself because the employees here are very busy (supposedly) all the time.  There are always super long lines. I mean the only benefit from this whole experience here is that they have really cheap gas prices. Plus you can alwasy find movies and tamales in the parking lot.  but hey really if you are really looking to save money food here is really cheap. :)
2 So, I come to this store becuase it's about 5 mins away from my house! Convinent! But.....The staff is rude and they ignore you and gossip over you to the other staff around you, they don't care what you think! Ghetto!!  But the prices are cheap.Store is Dirty!  I wish that the parking lot was lit up more though.... Beware of a black lady coming up to you 'in need of money for her kids!'  it's a load of Bullshit! Don't give anyone there any money, bunch of scam artists! Pros:Cheap Cons: Everything
2 Rude staff, messy place, dirty floors, but it gets the job done and is very convenient!
