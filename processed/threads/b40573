4 Great spot if you're into threading. There's an older lady there that I typically go to. She's the best.
5 I love this place! They have great customer service fast-paced threading your in and out in a jiffy!
5 After the last bad trip to the eye brow bar at the Mall, i was back out there looking for a good threading salon. Preetys came up so i drove halfway across town only to arrive half an hour past closing. But the proprietors were inside making repairs so they allowed me in. I was directed to a smiling older indian woman who promptly ushered me to the chair and got right to work. With a very gentle touch she cleaned up my very overgrown brows in a jiffy!  I was skeptical because she worked so tenderly but my brows were pefectly shaped and groomed. I will be a regular and refer friends!
