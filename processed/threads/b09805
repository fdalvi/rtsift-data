3 I ate a shitload of breakfast burritos from this place.  I'd recommend the Machaca.  They're only like $4 and it's pretty massive.  I'd say go with the green sauce though the red sauce isn't that bad.  Their chilaquiles were pretty good too but different to what I'm used to.  They were more like wet tacos than actual chilaquiles.  The place itself is sort of small and with not much to offer.  I'd say, get it to go.  Ask for a large cup for the green sauce.

3 The best thing about the burrito was the tortilla. I think I read on the menu they make them there and it was definitely fresh and really good. However, and though it was stuffed full, the meat wasn't that tasty. It had almost a pre-made/canned taste to it (though it obviously wasn't by texture) that just made the burrito weird tasting and kind of disappointing. I liked that it had guacamole, though. Could have used some cheese and/or sour cr√®me though.  The tacos were shredded beef with just lettuce and cheese. The shells were also really good. The beef was a little fattier than I'm used to but it was good. Definitely worth the $1 price tag, but I wouldn't pay much more.  Overall, a decent lunch that left me with some to eat later for under $7. Beats having to eat at Taco Bell, for sure.
