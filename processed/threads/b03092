1 I have a puppy- shorkie, this was her first cut...I was quoted $40 over the phone and charged $45 when I picked her up. I asked for a teddy bear cut... the cut is horrible! Her cut is all choppy and uneven, the top of her head looks like he gave her flat top. When I got her home I noticed I cut on the underside, in the joint area of her hind leg. I'm very upset. I will never go there again nor would I recommend this business to anyone
5 I've been coming here for longer than I can remember. I have always brought my two Labs here. My two dogs can be a little rambunctious sometimes. The staff is always great. They always do a great job every time, no matter how crazy my dogs. They really take pride in their work and I highly recommend them.
