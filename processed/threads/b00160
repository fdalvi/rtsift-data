4 Low cost good work. Two macaws in the waiting room.  Right by the mall on the East side.
1 A wash may be better priced than others but you'll get what you pay for. My husband brought out 2008 Prius for a wash and vacuum and it doesn't look like anything has been cleaned! The carpet in the hatch and floors are still dirty and none of the interior was wiped down. We will be going to Octopus or we'll just do it ourselves next time.
5 I came in with a free wash voucher after having my vehicle serviced at Ford. One of the guys who oversees the final wipe down of the car, inspected it once it came out of the wash, and said he wanted to put it through one more time because it was still dirty. They took the extra time to wipe the car by hand, and put it through the wash once more. Definitely more than I expected from any car wash facility... especially when I didn't even have to pay!
2 This time around wasn't so great. The interior of my car was wiped with dirty rags, and my car smelled like dirty rags until I got home and was able to wipe down the interior myself. They also didn't do quite so well on drying the car off - although I should have probably said something to the guys about doing a better job. Nevertheless, a very disappointing experience, after such positive one just a few months back.
1 I paid $17.50 for an inside-outside cleaning and was given a dirty car. After agreeing that the car was dirty, the manager refused to have them vacuum it again.
