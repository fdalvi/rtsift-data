5 Sandy Van helped us with a short sale and counseled us on our personal situation to even be able to short sale our home. She answered all our questions honestly and was very patient with us. She also had very good support staff which acted the same. The short sale process does take a long time but we received weekly updates from her practice. During the process we did not get harassed by the banks that held our mortgages (which was nice). I had heard about her through a reference and have no regrets with using her services. Although I had heard of several individuals who have short sold their home with simply a realtor, I do feel that her qualifications as a lawyer and realtor did help our situation.
5 I was buying a short sale house, and Sandy proved to be very knowledgeable in all aspects of the short sale process. She was patiently answering all my questions at any time of the day and night, including the weekends. I really enjoyed working with her and would definitely recommend for buying or selling a house. And she is an attorney too, which was really comforting for me.
5 Sandy Van was highly professional, and had my house sold in a week for a higher price than I expected. She answered all my questions and concerns quickly and in a positive manner. I would recommend her to anyone buying or selling their home or property.
