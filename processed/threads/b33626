4 This place has really good "World Famous" shakes.   Try the date one -especially unique. Only problem is they are way overpriced. Good price for gas considering its in the middle of the desert.
4 The place has adequate space and exceptionally clean bathrooms.  However, the gas prices are outrageous.  But this is expected on the 8.
4 Great date shake. They have nice amenities, some dates for sale, and friendly people. They also have lots of parking under the trees to grab a nap, a nice kennel for your dog, and is a great place to stop in the desert.
3 Not amazing but a good stop to pee and grab a drink. It is so very windy here! Watch out for sand in your eyes!
