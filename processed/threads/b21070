4 This place makes me want to smoke cigars, in a big bad way. I don't smoke and never have but I was prepared to get on the bandwagon.  The smell of this place would turn even the most anti -smoker to the dark side. Nothing would give me more pleasure (and cancer) than to spark up one of these up just for the smell of it.  Cigars are expensive though, a box of Fonseca No.1 will set you back Â£215 quid. I know there are cheaper ways to kill yourself, but this one pleases my nostrils the most.  I'll leave you with some advice my local Bishop always gave. If its not rolled on the inner thigh of 60 year old sweaty Cuban lady, it's not worth smoking.
3 When my uncle came up he was late meeting me cause he spent AGEEESSS in this shop and came out almost bouncing with a bag of well... cigars. I don't smoke so I failed to share his great excitment at the prospect of smoking that stuff (although they do smell nice ). According to family gossip it did not come at a cheap price. (especially cause you are going to burn it and it's not the healthiest thing to do- then again chocolate isn't either so scrap that).  He likes cigars and he was excited. If you like cigars you might be to.
3 I'm not a smoker (got get that in first, my mum reads these) so you might see it as a little redundant me reviewing this place. Well maybe it is, but that won't stop me.  It's a bit of a smack in the face walking in here. The music is REALLY loud (alright, alright old man) and the walls are stocked to the ceiling with glass fronted shelves full of cigars on the left and smoking paraphernalia on the right (yes that means pipes and bongs).  The cigar collection was pretty extensive, as was their pipe arsenal. It did seem a little expensive, not to mention a little intimidating. Probably not somewhere you'd take your mum.
5 My aggressive, racist and humourless old Uncle Jimmy had very little in the way of redeeming features (excluding the half day off work I got to attend his cremation), but pipe smoking was one of them. I find the chemical smell of fags pretty disgusting, and the weedy stench of a roll-up ciggie is just about as bad, but pipes and cigars are a different story.  You can't get away with it until you reach a certain age, as you'd look "ironic" doing it in your 20s, but there's just something wonderfully dignified, traditional, and wise about pipe smoking.  Fingers crossed it's here in a few decades, and I won't be just a window shopper.
5 Great selection of pipes, tobacco and cigars. Friendly staff always happy to give suggestions and advice!...
