3 Good pizza, so so wings good pasta.
4 I am going to say that this place restored my failth in S.O.N.Y. pizza. My last visit in the far N valley was gross.   This pizza was great, good flavor, good crust, good service.
3 I used to be a huge fan of Streets! When I first came out here in 94 you couldn't get a better pie in the valley. We used to go to the 19th ave location. But the years have not been good to my old Fav. The pizza is barely better than pizza hut anymore. It's lost a little something over the years. While the pizza is still good it's not great and who wants to pay $23.00 for an ok pie. Lately the pizza has been in the 12.00 range in regards to quality.   This must be the reason behind this locations recent closure. Bye Bye Streets.
