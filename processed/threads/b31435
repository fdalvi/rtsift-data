5 Wow, I called & spoke to Rami who came out same day to figure out my daughters car needed a new battery for her remote & her car. I did not want to have my daughters car to a mechanic nearby so I Googled this guy and since I am near 115 Ave and Happy Valley he was not to far from me, but I guess he goes everywhere and decided to stop by my house on his way home at the end of his day.  Since it was a simple problem he didn't even charge me for diagnosing the issue. I am surprised in this day & age with the cost of fuel $4/ gallon that he was still fair with me. I will be using him again in the future.
5 I love this guy he has been my mechanic for 5 years I will not purchase a vehicle unless he approves it and will never get my car serviced with anyone else.    He is like family.    I have never had a mechanic like him.  He is the BEST!   Comes to your home office anywhere!
5 Absolutely the best in the business.  Rami prides himself on prompt effective service at fair prices.  When dealerships cannot figure out the problems, they call him!  He has worked on nearly every car i have owned and his prices are always the best.  He never tries to oversell me or lie.  Do yourself a favor and call him now if you need a machanic.
