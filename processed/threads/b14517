2 I'd give this place 3 stars but the drive through line was about 12 cars deep, so we went inside.  It took 10 minutes to get our food after ordering.  Coulda been a bad night or a bad time (9:30pm) but this isn't the first time the lines have been really long here.    Food is normal, wait is not.
2 Right now to give this place two stars right now I will check back later, it extremely busy and they're filled with teenagers because McDonald's here is between two schools so lots of noxious loud teenagers in the afternoon on some mornings the weekend has a little bit better but the accuracy if you order is really bad I'll try it again later possibly but never too much problem in the drive-through seems to be very fast and a lot more accurate than on the inside.
2 This McDonald is renovated again. It is always packed,  drive thru is slow, difficult parking arrangement and currently impossible to drive and park. I cant even count how many times my order has been messed up here. A complete disappointment.
5 I LOVE this McDonalds! Awesome service, friendly smiles & great tasting food. I alter every order I make here (b/c I'm picky) and it's ALWAYS correct, I never have to send it back or go in from the drive thru b/c it's wrong.   I have been coming to this location for probably 2 years and I've seen staff promoted and it's so awesome. I can't say enough good things about this mcdonalds. Keep up the great work you guys!!! :)
