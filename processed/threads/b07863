1 We were also in a lazy mood and ordered in... The pizza came more quickly than we had anticipated! Which was good because we were hungry... About 3 bites in a found a long dark hair in my pizza... My wife trying to make me feel better assured me that it was probably hers. We both knew it wasn't. We started feeling much less hungry and as my wife went to throw the rest of the pizza away she found a big, black, nasty fly baked right in... Yum!   Maybe they were just having a bad day... But regardless we won't be ordering from them again... My wife makes better homemade pizza anyways...
3 It was good while we were there for a stop over in Phoenix.
