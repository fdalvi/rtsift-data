1 The doctors in this office are ok, but the staff is terrible, I needed to get copies of my medical records and the front desk girl told me that they will be ready on the same day, gave me a form to fill out and to pick up later on that afternoon. I went back and it turns out that they could not have them ready that same day, but in 2 days will be ready....I let a week pass by, when I called the medical record's person to make sure they were there because I was on my way, he stated that my records were not ready and that it will take a MONTH for them to be ready! He told me this information before I even said my name or anything else!! He then went on to say there was 50something ppl ahead of me and that it cannot be done sooner.(He was the same guy that told me my records would be ready in 2days) I was like "this guy must think I'm a real idiot or what?" First of all no doctor's office can possible take longer than 2days to print out a couple of pages, and for him to give me that kind of information without even knowing who I was or how long was I waiting already totally revealed his false statements about how things work, he was a totally caught lying. They never apologized for the run around they been giving me and they have the nerve to charge .60cents per page!  This is unprofessional and unethical behavior coming from the employees working there, don't they realize medical records are serious documents doctor's need on a daily basis to find out about patient's conditions? The way the are running that office is a real joke, not to mention all the mistakes they make, but yet they are very quick to charge you and overcharge you whenever they get a chance!
1 Pretty sure that if you're a dermatologist, you should look at my skin while I'm in your office. Not here. Instead, the doctor looked at his computer and continually asked me questions like "Who's treating you now?" (Uh, nobody, that's why I'm here.) "Who last treated you?" (Dermatologists in South Dakota, Minnesota, California....you know them?)   Front desk staff wasn't the best either...I have eyes, and you can look in them whenever you want, just to convey friendliness or whatever.   Props to the PA though, he actually looked at me and cared about me. I won't be back.
1 HORRIBLE customer service!
5 I love it here !!!!!!! Miss Lisa is the bomb .She always makes me more beautiful. Her photo facials are beyond description. She always treat me with the best bed side manners. Makes me forget the pain . Shes always cheerful and so pretty.
1 Horrible! I have been here 2 times. This would have been the third but had to walk out because I had been waiting for an hour and a half after my SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT!!! Horrible!! The doctor on my second visit literally spent 2 minutes with me. No exaggeration. Go somewhere!!!
