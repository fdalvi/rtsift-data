4 All I can say is....Coconut Seven Layer Bar Ice Cream! YUMMY!! This was WAY WAY WAY overpriced, but it was so good in a waffle cone!
3 Holy crap, how is it that a sundae costs $7.99?  If they weren't offering a buy one waffle cone or sundae, get one free, there's no way my boyfriend and I would have gotten separate sundaes.  It was the perfect snack to keep me occupied while I waited for the Mirage volcano show to start.
4 Stopped here for a late night snack. It was 10 minutes til closing. They would only do scoups and cups not sundaes since it was so close to closing. My husband loved his chocolate dipped cone.
2 Expensive ice cream here! Crazy expensive!
3 Who doesn't love ice cream? I love Ben and Jerry's ice cream but I didn't like the prices. This was considered splurging for me, but it was good. Now I'll save up and splurge again in about a month.
4 This little ice cream stand is tucked away inside Casino Royal next to a large McDonalds on the strip.   When I went, there was a buy one get one free deal on low fat soft serve ice cream! Nothing in this world makes me happier than ice cream.  The price for technically ONE soft serve waffle cone was over $10 which may be slightly steep but I did get two for the price.   The actual ice cream was okay. I much prefer the cheaper and creamier McDonalds cone or a McFlurry. In all fairness, they did provide a spoon!  Service was quick. It's a little stand with usually 2 servers who were speedy with swirling and cashing.
