4 Pretty sure this is not closed, since I go here all the time. I am a big fan of the Pharmacy and the Pharmacist (Brian) is a very cool guy, knows his stuff, and gets things done! Overall I would give the Pharmacy 2 Thumbs Up!
3 It's just your typical Walgreens. They have it all and are open somewhat late. It's always my stop in place when I've forgotten something. Staff is pretty friendly as it should be.
4 I made some purchases here for my nonprofit group.  I was able to get some gel deoderant with some coupons from the Sunday paper and coupons from the store.  My final purchase was 12 sticks of deoderant for $21.  I made the purchases over several times and at different stores because I am learning how the coupons work.  I believe I scored with the price, and it will definitely help my group.  The cashier was helpful, after I told her what I was doing.  She didn't fully understand the coupons, but she tried.  I plan on going back to see what more I can get for my nonprofit group.  They can have some good deals, you just have to look for them.
