3 I always have to check out Sheik.  I have bought Jordans from them before and if they sold fake ones, I hope they would get a better selection.  I have not shopped at this Vegas one, but never had a problem with Sheik.  I only comment because I hate fake Jordans and the pair I bought is from 8 years ago and if they were fake, they would have fallen apart already.  They are the IX white grey and navy.
1 Very disappointed in this company. I ordered a couple pairs of boots for my daughter two days after Christmas. It is now January 14th and still no boots. Kinda funny, considering the money has been withdrawn from my bank account since Dec. 27th huh!? I've tried to email the customer service department, even tried calling the 1-800 number given to me by an employee in the mall location (who was very rude about it BTW) the status of my order continues to say "still not shipped" and I continue to have NO answers. Don't waste your money on poor customer service.
