1 When you order a calzone you think you would get a calzone 40 minutes goes by I have to get a pizza because somebody didn't place the order correctly thanks for wasting time on my father daughter date
1 Slow service, bad pizza. The only good thing was they had 5 TVs and had the World Cup playing which we wanted to see. Other than that yuck. Pizza was greasy and undercooked.
4 Found Boka randomly one day, and has been one of my favorite pizza places since! The servers and friendly. I've met the owner a couple times and he is joyfully friendly as well! The Pizza is delicious and there are many choices! There is a little wait because they cook in a brick in an oven but it's well worth the wait! Also, they have great prices on beer! So grab a beer while you wait for your pizza to cook and hang out! Love this place!
