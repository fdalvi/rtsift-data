1 I went here for an oil change.  I mean it's around $30 and you get a free car wash.  Seems like a deal.  They claim to do a 16 point inspection but they don't or at least my particular technician did not.  When I spoke to the manager he didn't seem to care.  No explanation to the poor service whatsoever.  Needless to say I won't be going back to this location.  It's fine if  Terrible's just wants to perforn an oil change for that price but then don't promise extras.
4 I love this Terrible's location.....why?  Here's why:  PROS - It's in my neighborhood & conveniently located so I can stop by for gas on my way back from most parts of the Valley.  - Use of the car vacuum cleaners are FREE.  - The car wash services.  It's a typical Terrible Herbst medium  sized car wash setup.  - They have oil change & other minor car maintenance services.  CONS - I can't really think of one.  I come here mostly for the gas & vacuum cleaning.  I have other Terrible locations that I prefer for the oil change services.  Will I return?  Yep!
5 it's a gas station!  fill er up, and the gas gets me from a to b. =) what else could i ask for?!?!
5 I come here to get gas. It's close to work, so that's cool. Other than that... um... I like the gas here?
5 I don't get gas here, but I do use the car wash and vacuums :)  You'll find me here weekly!
2 Pump #6 card reader doesnt work!!  And so when I told the guy inside that, he said, "oh yeah, I know.. happens all the time".  ARE YOU SERIOUS!!!???  Then why don't you get it fixed????
3 I really dig the free vaccines. They are powerful and the hoses are long enough to get the entire interior of your vehicle.
