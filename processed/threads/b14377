4 Great selection of post-holiday sales and friendly staff to help find what I needed.  Found plenty of little socks with monkeys on them, pajamas, and had no trouble with sizing.  Great vibe in the store.  Convenient location adjacent to Rock Bottom Brewpub at Dessert Ridge is nice as well.
4 The hopscotch court was fun to do as you enter the store. Unfortunately, I didn't have much luck finding something for my 4 1/2 year old niece, but they had tons more stuff for the smaller kiddies. The store itself is kinda small, but packed with clothes, although if you have a stroller you might find it frustrating. The staff was friendly and the clothing was all nice and tidy.
5 I came to this store looking specifically for pajamas. I did not find what I was looking for. The selection for the type of pj I was looking for was very limited in the size I needed and style choices. The kind woman working offered to call the nearest location for more options. I took her up on her offer, however no luck at the other store either. Although I did not find what I was looking for, I think the store deserves 5 stars because the service is always helpful and pleasant. In addition, the store is always clean and my little one enjoys the Lego table!
5 Everything is always in sale and the staff are super friendly! If you search the clearance racks in the way back you can find some steals! For example, 2 pair of leggings for $4.99 and tshirts for $2.99. They have table with building blocks which is a great way to distract my kids so I can shop! We love desert ridge, and this store is one of the reasons I do!
