4 I love how you can deposit cash and checks through their ATMs. Even in the drive thru!
2 Not pleased with this branch at all. :/ I see no logic in telling me I can't use checks I am cashing to get a cashiers check when I am an account holder.  BUT..... I can cash those checks come back and they would issue me one? Fucking stupid! !!!! How is that logical? All they did is piss me off to the point I won't come to this branch.  I seriously want to walk back in and get a money order with the teller right next to the other guy.  Grrrrrrrrrr.
