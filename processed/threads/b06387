5 Dr Dan Rutz helped me so much with my back.  Went in sore and barely walking left feeling better. Highly knowledgable and competent Chiro.  I feel very lucky to have been referred to him!
5 Dr Dan is great at helping to keep my family healthy we go for regular adjustements and he has helped my son with his alergies.  He knows his stuff and has a true adjustment table not just a message table. I like that i can get in same day if i tweak my back at work i call and he will be that waiting for me to make it through traffic to get there on my way home.  a great guy who does a great job
5 I must say, I never imagined a chiropractor visit could make you feel so much better, but it seriously does! I originally came here a few weeks ago due to severe lower back pain and Dr. Dan fixed me up within a few visits.   We now are doing weekly visits to work on my neck and back and I already feel very different. I have learned that working out years of back pain can take some time, so don't expect to be fixed over night.   The staff is very friendly and they seem flexible with scheduling. He accepts most major insurances and thankfully Culinary insurance.   My only complaint is the office location, although easy to get to... Leaving is tough!  The location has one of those annoying right-turn only exits. One day, when I am president of the world, I will ban those annoying right-only turns.
