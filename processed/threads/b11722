5 The owner, Hrair, provides absolutely superior customer service.  He is the only one I trust with all my cleaning and alteration needs.  He has also "saved" my wife's leather purse after being stained with lotion.  Highly recommend!!
1 So worried about an apparent parking problem that he pushed a customer away.  There were tons of empty spots but as I was about to enter his store, owner assumed I was going to a different store.    After he was such a jerk, I went away.
1 I stopped in here purely for the sake of convenience. My usual go-to tailor is off Flamingo and my go-to shoe repair guy is off Eastern, but Park Avenue Cleaners is a lot closer to my house. So one day on the way home I decided to bring a dress that needed the zipper repaired and a pair of shoes that needed new heels put on.  It was clear that the guy behind the counter (maybe the owner?) watched me from the moment I parked (in front of the store) and walked inside. He completely, obviously attempted to up-charge me probably because of the following: 1) I arrived in a BMW, 2) my dress was Herve Leger and he commented on the brand and 3) my shoes were Christian Louboutin, which he also commented on the brand. I did not need them re-soled, which is what he tried to sell me, I just needed the little rubber heels replaced, from wear. We went back and forth and he tried to charge me nearly $50. Out of control!   He wanted $18 just for the rubber heel replacement, when my go-to shoe repair guy (B&L Shoe Repair off Eastern Ave.) charges $10 flat, regardless of what brand the shoes are.  I said thanks but no thanks and walked out.
1 Terrible guest service. I asked them to take up the hem of a dress and they totally botched it. Isn't this supposed to be their expertise? and then Hriar tried to tell me it was my fault. Worst experience at an alteration place I have ever had, do not bring anything here to be altered. I will never give them anymore business.  They way overcharged me for the quality of their service.
