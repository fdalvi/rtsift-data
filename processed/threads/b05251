4 OK, so I know this is a chain. This review isn't really for the food. Honestly you either love or hate pizza hut. It's generic prefab pizza... it's the McDonalds of the pizza world.  This review is purely for the service. While Papa Johns here in Vegas has proven crapy and unreliable.. these guys have been stand outs as far as junky pizza goes. They are always fast to deliver, easy to talk to on the phone, and the "qualitY" if you will has been 100% consistent. Also on the night we got 4-8 inches of snow in Green Valley these guys were out there delivering pizza.. even the manager got in his car and started doing some deliveries.   So if you do want to get your junk food pizza on in Green Valley, this place is quite reliable. I prefer Settebello, or Metro.. or Rosati's.. but sometimes this pizza fiend needs a little PH too.
1 Terrible pizza terrible service terrible timing terrible delivery terrible everything.
4 BEST REMEDY FOR A HANGOVER!  I typically don't eat a lot of pizza but when I do, it's almost always Pizza Hut.  I love the grease and the moist bread.  This specific place is literally a hole in the wall.  No seating and not much standing room, however, it's never been busy everytime I visit.  Today we came by to buy a medium pepperoni pizza for 8 bucks.  We also have a discount from our company so everything came out to about $7.50.  The person who helped us was named Ashton.  He was good looking and super nice.  Told us it would take 10 minutes and it was really earlier than that.    I know pizza is a sensitive issue for a lot of people.  For me, I'm a simple kind of guy.  Grew up on Pizza Hut and will continue eating Pizza Hut.  Since this place is so convenient from work, I'll definitely be coming back again.
3 Normally this pizza hut is quick and deliver guality pizza.  Lsst night it took over 1 hour from when I ordered online and it looked and tasted cold.  Every other time has been good though.  I will give them another shot.
