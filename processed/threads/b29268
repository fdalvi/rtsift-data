5 A dude rating an OBGYN? Weird, right? Not really. Dr Bullaro delivered our daughter and will be delivering our second child in December. She is fantastic. My wife and I recommend her every chance we get.
3 I have loved this office and staff from day one. Kind and very helpful. My only complaints would have to be scheduling and lack of availability.  I recently went in for an appt on a monday and was told that I had miscarried at 11.5 weeks. This being our second miscarriage, I chose to opt for a D&C to spare the emotional and physical pain. Once I completed the blood work I was told that the anesthesiologist would be contacted and I could have the procedure by Thursday or Friday of that week. I tried not to move a muscle the entire week so as not to cause the miscarriage earlier. I called to check up on the details of the procedure and was told the anesthesiologist would be out of town until Monday. Needless to say I was terrified and upset. I was also very frustrated that only ONE person was on call and happened to be unavailable. I ended up painfully miscarrying the night before the scheduled procedure. Something I can't imagine going through again.    This is such an incredible practice with wonderful people, but I truly wish they had a FEW people who are on call to be available in situation like this. Also to allow more flexible scheduling to high risk patients. I would have loved to get my first appt around 7 weeks but had to wait until 11.5.
