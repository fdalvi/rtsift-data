3 gave this place three stars for what it is ... a hotel in the burbs - hotel was a good value and there was an acceptable indian joint across the parking lot.
1 Pulled into this hotel tonight after a very long day.This hotel was recommended by a colleague. This will be my first and last night here. I booked online directly at Hampton Inn's web site 48 hours ago.   When I arrived tonight at 7:30 pm Eastern, they gave me ROOM 207 which has to be the worst room in this hotel -- there is no natural light. The room is over the carport and the room window is blocked by the hotel's sign.   Supposed to be here 2 nights. Methinks not! I will find a different hotel for tomorrow night.  Too bad for the sales team at Hampton Inn in Kitchener!  I will be in the Kitchener/Waterloo, Ontario area 3 days per week for next 6 months, starting today. I was going to make this place my destination hotel. NO WAY.  In addition, restaurants around here are "C" quality. A decent cup of coffee is one mile away at Starbucks.  I thought Hampton Inn was a decent brand. I stayed at a lovely Hampton Inn in Williamsville, NY (outside Buffalo) two weeks ago. It was super.  Any suggestions Yelpers for better hotels for business travelers in Kitchener/Waterloo, Ontario?
5 I stay in a lot of Fairfields, Hamptons, Courtyards...  This place checks the main 5 boxes for any business hotel:  1.Clean 2.Quiet - no stupid/ancient heaters/ACs that dont shut off or cycle every 5 minutes. 3.Good water pressure and HW on 4th floor. 4.Good/free wifi. 5.Convenient/walkable to basic food options.  That's a solid 4.....but it gets the full 5 for intangibles:  Treadmill, pool, lobby carpets in good condition.  Snacks at checkin, fresh fruit (actual ripe bananas - shocking for corporate hotel hell).  Hot water for tea at 10 PM was hot.  Cable options were plentiful and TV had good HD (not fake HD) to watch the hockey game.  That's a 5 in my book.
