4 A family member passed away earlier this year and his wake was held here.  It's a very peaceful, serene place and I felt very comfortable here.  I wasn't part of the planning or anything so I'm not sure how they are on that end of things.  The staff that worked here seemed very accommodating.  At least, when I interacted with them, I didn't feel as if I was being a burden... they were definitely there to help.  Well, I really don't know what else to say I guess I'll leave it at that...
4 Hard to say that "I'm a fan," as this is my mother's final resting place -- but Palm made the process and planning as easy as possible. The staff was very professional and empathetic, and the ceremony was as I expected it to be.  Right now, there are large patches of brown grass (especially in the "Freedom" area), which I would like to see corrected.
4 Palm mortuary is peaceful.  The grounds are kept up with trees, shrubs, and green grass (within Vegas standards).  A fine place for your body as a resting place.
