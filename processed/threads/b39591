2 Very clean place. The interior looks very nice. Customer service is so so... When I first walked in I was greeted right away. Right when I sat down the nail tech got on her phone... Than she seemed unknowledgable of what I wanted. So than another tech helped me. He was nice ... But  my manicure I got there looked like a little kid did my nails... Plus I payed 35 dollars which was kinda high for a bad looking manicure.  I would not go back there ... But again only upside is how good the place looks.
5 I was skeptical about going because I'm so picky with my nails but decided to give it a try. I use my nails long and that's why I was iffy about getting them there. I was greeted once I walked in. the place is very clean and sanitary. Which is very important to me. (I don't wanna catch any infections or anything crazy while getting my nails done) It got very busy as soon as I walked in. Everyone seemed to be waiting for all kind of services but more popular was eyebrow wax by David. He seemed like he was on high demand by the ladies. The nail tech who did my nails was lee. I love my nails. They came out very nice and long! The way I like them!! I left him a $10 tip and my total was ONLY $20!! He was very happy with his tip nonetheless. I'm a great tipper to great service!! I'll be going back there again!!
5 Nice place and clean. Went in for a last min mani and pedi while in town from LA. Both men that attended me were nice and did a good job (forget their names) they have a good price list too. Deff a good idea to try them out
