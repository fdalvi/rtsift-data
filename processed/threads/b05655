4 If you need to wax your eyebrows, you need to come here!  LeeAnn is truly the waxing brow QUEEN! (: I stopped going, since my skin has been getting a little too sensitive for wax, but for 10$ this is the best you're going to get! (:  **LeeAnn is off Tuesdays, so don't bother going on that day.
5 I got a great French manicure there! From out of town and kind of stumbled on it. Kinda nervous to do that but was definitely satisfied. Will go back whenever I can!
