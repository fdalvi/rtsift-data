3 Smoothies smoothies smoothies how I love you. Although I tend to make smoothies at home I will buy them from time to time. Keva Juice is in The District of Desert Ridge right next to AMC offering a wide variety of tasty smoothies. Now one problem I do have with Keva Juice is they only offer one size, and it isn't that big. As I said I love smoothies so sometimes I like them for meals, but these just aren't big enough! I think they should invest in some bigger cups for sure! Other than that Keva gets my approval. The people there have always been great, and they have really let me customize my smoothies there!
4 I can only comment on two of the smoothies because I am on a banana kick and I choose from one of the two: the Bananrama or the Peanut Butter Chocolate. Oh so good! And now they do offer more than one size!  I have started getting this for dinner versus food! I love it!
2 I really love getting smoothies and checking out small smoothie shops but I was a little disappointed with this one.   My smoothie was bland, tasted mostly like the soy milk ingredient, and I noticed that all the smoothie are juice and sherbet based and don't actually have fresh fruit in them. bummer.  I tried the acai smoothie, which had acai juice, raspberry juice, sherbet, and soymilk in it and it was ok.   These smoothies need fresh fruit ingredients!
