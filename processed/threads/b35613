1 Placed an order online for a couple of pizzas at this restaurant and they got the order late.  I called to inquire the status because it was supposed to be there 10 minutes earlier.  I was told they just got the order 25 minutes ago and I would have to wait.  No apology no time for how long or anything.  Just "You have to wait."  They also didn't answer the phone nicely just "hello"  Sorry, but if you can't have good customer service, you can't have my business.
1 Waited over an hour for our food, and it was pretty gross. Breadsticks were dry, bland and near inedible. Pizza was overcooked and unimpressive. Also ordered a cup of ranch, and it was slimy and thin. Not like any ranch dressing I've ever seen! Would not recommend.
1 I placed my order via grubhub online.  It was delivered ontime however, they forgot the sauces and dressing for the salad.  Also, I had walked downstairs and the delivery guy banged on the door about 8 times and immediately rang the doorbell about 7 times.  When I did get to the door about 5 seconds after his initial pounding of the door, he said "were you not going to open the door?"  I replied, I was coming up the stairs and if you had not banged the door and rang the doorbell multiple times, I would still have been here in the same amount of time.  He grunted and shoved the food into my hands.  Half the food was great but from the delivery guy and the forgotten sauces, I will never order from them again.  I will say that the falafel I got from them was good.  But NOT THAT good.  If they can't deliver with a smile, they can never deliver again.
