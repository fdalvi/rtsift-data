1 Dr. (male) seemed gentle with my cat but, as a medical professional, I am deeply concerned with his complete lack of direction on how to proceed with treatment of my cat with a common kidney ailment.  Rather than beginning any treatment, Dr. wanted to proceed with numerous other far-reaching, non-specific tests with large price tags.  Poor follow up and dirty exam rooms were troubling. I care enough for my pets to know they deserve better than this.
4 They have always been good with all of my pets, prices could be more competitive however.
5 I've taken my dog to this clinic a couple of times and we love it.  Clean, supportive environment.  The staff is wonderful, so this is our "go to" clinic.
1 They misdiagnosed our cat as having diabetes. After the cat went into insulin shock they said 'well, sometimes it just goes away.' Seems like they to want to kill animals as expensively as possible.
5 Over several years and 2 beloved cats, dr. Linden & Walker couldn't be more competent or compassionate. I believe they have a great staff & very reasonable prices. Love this place!
5 I only found this clinic because my Saint Bernard's doctor, Dr. Ashley Greenway, began working there. I cannot praise her enough. She is a marvelous doctor. She is brilliant, straight forward, and honest. My Saint Bernard has a slew of oddball heath problems, from entropion and corneal issues to allergies to ear infections; and she has quickly and accurately dealt with them all. She is always super patient with him, even though he is pretty much a complete spazz.   The clinic boasts a staff of HIGHLY skilled technicians, who have veterinary experience ranging from emergency medicine to surgery, and are dang near doctors themselves.   The clinic is peaceful, cozy and it is easy to feel at home. Please stop by and meet the awesome staff and our favorite veterinarian in the valley!
