5 Great local spot, bring a book or a board game. Free great coffee! community and frequent live music.
5 This little Irish themed community coffee house,tucked away in a strip mall in Queen Creek is quite the oasis in a parched landscape. Wonderful staff, great coffee and tea, wonderfully talented artists and musicians coming together every weekend to create a fantastic family atmosphere that everyone can enjoy. Bluegrass,folk,country and rock and roll to name a few. Do yourself a favor and make the short trip to Third Place Cup. You won't regret it...
5 LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! From the first time I came in, I was treated like family. The baristas are loving and quirky, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the coffee is to die for! You can tell that they love what they do. Beans are roasted fresh daily, drinks are crafted with care and are reasonably priced. I am hooked! Third Place Cup is Queen Creek's best kept secret!
5 Excellent Coffee. Fun atmosphere, Loving Staff. Great Coffee and tea drinks. Fantastically talented musicians appear here on friday and saturday nights.  What's great is the level of hospitality and the warm people.  It's become my home away from home. Michael.
5 I went there today with my wife. John the owner is such a great guy, he is really nice and will talk to you. The coffee they make is off the charts amazing. They use a manual stream press coffee machine, they form the coffee grounds into a puck then brew beautiful espresso. This place is amazing. Way better then Starbucks, You need to try this place out.
