5 this is a great service. They are prompt; the vans are clean and well kept. Their price will beat any other company. They know their way around traffic delays and drop you off at the terminal right where you need to be. The most they ever have is two stops per vehicle, so you aren't sitting in the van while other customers are dropped off or picked up. In the multiples times we have used them we have had the van to ourselves each time. And they don't charge extra for the jokes! I enjoy spending my money with this company.
5 The fare's are reasonable, and the van was neat and clean. I can't say enough about how courteous, an attentive they were, not to mention how great the conversation was while in route. They're on time and even called to remind me the day before I was using their service. I'm slightly disabled and unable to walk very far without considerable pain, they took that into consideration and helped me beyond delivering me to my destination. I really can't say enough good things about this service, but I know I'll always use them when traveling again.
5 Always on time. So nice and friendly and helpful. Doesn't make a ton of other stops either. The Scotsman (and he really is Scottish) always gets us where we need to go!
