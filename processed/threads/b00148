2 I stopped here on the way to my hometown from the airport one of the last times I was in the Madison area. I'm normally a huge fan of the Wisconsin Swiss Melt, but the one I had here was not so good.  First, the sandwich was exceptionally greasy. I don't think I've ever had a patty melt-type sandwich that was that greasy in my life. Yeah, I understand this is a joint that specializes in butter burgers, but this was extreme, even for Culver's.  Second, the size of the burger was pathetic. Admittedly, I've been out of Wisconsin for a few years now, so maybe my recollection of the size of Culver's burgers isn't so good, but the patty on this particular sandwich was seriously thin, and the burger came no where close to covering the bread.  If you're just passing through the north side of Madison and have a sudden craving for Culver's, I'd suggest you keep going and stop at the location in Waunakee or the location near East Towne Mall, depending upon which direction you're heading.
1 This Culvers gives Culvers a bad name. Ive had excessively slow service, hair in my ice cream and burgers that resemble dog food and that's enough for me. Ive never quite seen a burger paddy so thin and greasy before in my life. You've  got to be desperate to eat there.
