5 The owners are so friendly, so patient, and so helpful.  They go over and beyond what you would expect.  They are always aware of who is waiting and how long and how they can expedite your visit.
5 This is the place!  Jo and her staff are amazingly helpful.  They go above and beyond to fix another company's errors.  One can really judge a company by how they problem solve and this place knows how to take care of its customers.  I can't recommend them highly enough.  Where is the ten star button?
5 Outstanding customer service.  They are so helpful and friendly here.  A great place to ship packages, have signs and banners printed or to rent a private mailbox.
4 Jo gives great service here. I was able to get all my printing and shipping needs taken care of rather quickly. She has a great personality and pays close attention to detail. These are great skills to look for from someone that is mailing out your important documents :)  Will return again!
5 Great customer service!  They are extremely helpful and look for ways to save money on shipping your package. Highly recommend!
5 They are always so helpful with packing up boxes for me. Very professional and courteous. I was in there once while an irate customer was yelling about his son closing a box( not Post Net's fault) and they were unfailingly polite and professional with this man in spite of his hysteria and rudeness. Very impressive! This is a convenient and pleasant place to serve your shipping needs. They also help you save money on mailing your packages.
