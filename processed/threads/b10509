5 Dr. Baig is very flexible as far as psychiatrists go. She is compassionate and cares about her patients far more than many other psychiatrists I've seen. While her religious affiliation is obvious to even a casual observer, she does not allow her religion to interfere with giving the best, most professional care to all of her patients.   Her waiting room is almost always full and waits can be very long, but this is the sign of a good psychiatrist. A psychiatrist with an empty waiting room is bad news because that means nobody wants to see them!   I am extremely satisfied with the care I receive from Dr. Baig. In fact, I drive nearly 200 miles St. George, Utah to her office in Las Vegas just to go see her.
1 My wife was a patient here.  Run away from this office.  Long waits, unsympathetic care of questionable competency and constant billing errors await you.  All delivered from an uncaring staff.  My wife saw the psychiatrist to have here medication adjusted.  Then after that, even though the medication was not adjusted correctly, it was never corrected.  This happens because every time you think you make an appointment, you never know if you will be seen or by whom.  You could wait two or three hours (not uncommon) or you might see a psychiatric nurse.  Of course you might always see her husband the other Dr. Baig.  He is a psychiatrist, but what seems to be lost on people in this office is that he is not your psychiatrist or the person you made an appointment to see.  I don't know why so many insurance companies have her as a provider.  Their criteria clearly does not include quality of care.
