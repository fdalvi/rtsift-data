5 Food court at Ghettrocenter.  I don't know why it's so good, but it is. I'd put it up against any comparable restaurant (Samurai Sams, Kyoto Bowl, Panda Express, etc).  I always order the 2-entree plate with fried rice, spicy chicken, and teriyaki chicken. Try it--you won't be sorry!
5 Quick update: It still rocks
5 If you haven't eaten here . . . you're missing out.
2 Positives-employees try and be friendly and they have some decent entrees.  Negatives-Chow Mein/Rice are all nasty and ruin your dish.  Panda Express is much better, sadly, you need to go down the road three miles for it.
5 One thing I miss about Arizona. They have good quality food and the employees are very nice. I haven't been in almost a year but I crave it regularly. My mother who still goes to Metro often stated that they upped their prices so she is no longer going which sucks as their prices were already a bit on the steep side compared to the same plating options at similar food chains. I have since moved out of state and can't find anything that can quite compare.
5 This place is probably the only redeeming factor of metro center mall. The mall is horrendous these days and nothing like the Golden days. However if you're still in the area and looking for some quality food then give jade a try. The food is delicious. Tastes fresh and the staff are friendly as can be. If I could only recommend one thing on the menu is would certainly be their crab puffs. Don't hesitate. Eat jade today.
1 This place is nasty. What are they serving?!  I'm still sick from the "chicken" I ate 2 days ago. Gross!!
5 This restaurant has been around for years and is the best restaurant in the mall bar none.   I like a lot of the dishes but my main choices are usually the Teriyaki Chicken, Beef and Broccoli, Orange Chicken and/or Kung Pao Chicken.  It's so much better than Panda Express.
