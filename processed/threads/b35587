5 Bill Searle does a great job filming and editing your videos. You can trust him to do weddings, commercials, sports events, trailers, info-mercials, music videos, standup comedy or just about any type of event where a camera man and editor is needed.   He did my wedding and did a great job of capturing every important moment without being overbearing. He delivered us a DVD super fast and did exactly what we asked and has very reasonable prices.
5 Bill Searle and Cholla Productions are super-- Bill is a terrific and talented videographer and also a 'people person' who is kind, helpful, patient and good natured throughout the process.  Bill has done a lot of video work for me, including making a DVD of twenty five years of photos that my husband and I watch every anniversary.  Bill gives his work and his customer's videos a personal touch.  He really tailors the product to the customer.  I highly recommend Bill and Cholla!
5 Bill did a great job helping us promote our business with a very unusual animal-related video. He was very patient and helpful and the final project has everyone saying the same thing: "Hilarious."
