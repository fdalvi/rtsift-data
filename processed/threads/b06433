2 my nails were chipping within a week and the gel they used was obviouslynot real gel because they were still wet when I got into the car....I'd rather spend the extra money and go to diamond nails!
5 I love this shop! They really do a great job on my nails. My nails never chip or break. I never go anywhere else now. Lonnie and Jonathan are the best, and they run a nice, clean shop.
5 I love love love this place. I needed a place walking distance from csn and although there are other options, this is the only place I've ever needed to go to. The staff are amazing, john is a little quiet at first but once he opens up he's a riot. On my second visit Lana (I think, I feel awful not remembering her name) remembered my name, that I was hoping for a promotion at work and asked how my daughter liked the Elmo show we went to see. In other words, she really remembered me, and that's impressive, especially in this town. My glitter tips are amazing, she used a colored glittered acrylic powder and it was like magic when she was applying it. I sat there just fascinated. On my second trip I got the deluxe pedicure and was that just awesome. I didn't ever want it to stop. Lastly I mentioned that I had seen positive reviews about the place and johns exact words were "we really have the best clientele" in other words, they really appreciate their customers. Such a great place, such a wonderful experience. I will go to them for as long as I live in Las Vegas.
