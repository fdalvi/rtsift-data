5 GREAT!  Tasha and Lynn are wonderful and the prices very reasonable
1 Wow,just left this place after a staycation at the Westin Kierland. Not only were the tubs very dirty but they did a horrible job. I will not go again........EWWW
5 This is a great salon. The care and service given is top notch. Tasha made sure I was satisfied and was very fast and friendly. I wanted to stay longer and be pampered.  Don't believe the bad reviews, simply not true. Steve
5 Amazing service and really friendly staff!!! Very much recommended!!
1 My friend went here for the 1st time, and will be the last.  I walked in asking for a mani pedi... and not one person looked at me or greeted me until I had been standing up front for 10 mins or more, then they told me 20min. So I waited, my friend showed up 10mins and we still waited another 15-20 mins.  As for the nails. they convinced me to upgrade and it says in description that you get 10 min massage, I got zero minutes. Very disappointed.  My friend was almost done by the time someone started doing anything for me.  We spend 3hours in this place.  My girlfriends gels nails were sloppy and the worker said come back tomorrow...what?...who has time!?! The best part is leaving and going to sushi. Sorry. I will not go here again.
