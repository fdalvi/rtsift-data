4 I will take Baja Fresh over that other place any time.  Any time.  This particular place is clean and friendly.  I personally stick with the orignal Baja fish tacos.  There is something about their special tangy sauce that I really really like.  I also get the express guacamole and chips - made fresh with no wierd additives.  The chips are fresh made, I can tell, and I'm so glad they do this.  Comfortable seating; an ideal place to have a quick meal.
