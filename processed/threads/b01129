3 this place is pretty hard to find if you're not looking for it, because it is behind a circle k.  it's a typical dive bar, with super friendly people, lots of weirdos, pool and dart tournaments. also: karaoke. the people here are really into the karaoke, too. there was a lot of softer stuff like the 60s dude who sang the doors, nights in what satin and patsy cline; a dude they call elvis who looks like he is from a weirdo alternate universe and sings frank sinatra type stuff (also: he smells horribly bad); and a bunch of cougars singing old-80s bombs.  the men's bathroom is super awkwardly setup, but if you're the type that wants to show yourself off, you can probably make that happen pretty easily, since about the whole bar can you see the urianal when you open the door.  i doubt it will become a staple for us but it might end up in the rotation when we're in the mood for something different.  be on the lookout for randy. he'll probably talk to you
5 Great neighborhood sports bar!! Price is right, lots of drink specials. If you like playing pool or darts this place is for you.
3 We were looking for a dive bar, and a dive bar we got. Upon entry, I was a little scared and concerned that DMX (aka: Earl Simmons)  was on his way in with us, packing some major heat. Hey, you never know. Where *are* my dogs at?   I noticed this is a Pittsburgh Steeler haunt. Pool is complimentary on Sunday evenings.   The air hockey table was unplugged.   It was a dive.
