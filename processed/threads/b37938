5 Went here for the first time yesterday and had a totally awesome experience. Josh went well out of his way to help me with a few handmade boards I brought in, and he even gave me suggestions that actually led to not having to buy so much from him. That's the gold standard in customer service in my opinion. The shop is small but has quality stuff at great prices, and it's awesome to have a local skate shop in the area. This is my new spot for sure, highly recommend!
5 Keep Screamin is awesome. I haven't been on a board in 25 years and had no idea what I was looking for. Josh guided me through the process of selecting a board based on what I planned on using the board for. He answered questions without trying to sell me on anything. He even suggested some bearings that were less expensive but would be easier to maintain and last longer than the more expensive bearings.  A+ service all around and I know where I plan on getting my next setup from.  I fell off a skateboard for the first time in 25 years and it felt awesome! Thanks, Josh. I'll see you soon.
5 This skate shop is dope! Awesome urban downtown feel to it. Badass graffiti art inside. Great selection of goods to build a complete. Also awesome longboards and cruisers already put together. The owner Josh is very chill and down to earth and is always helpful! I try to stop through here whenever I'm in the area to see what new products he has available. Last week he had a huge display of consolidated decks and was putting up some new kicks on the wall. Definitely check this place out, you won't regret it!
