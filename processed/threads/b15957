5 Went here 2 times and had excellent service in picking out boxes and reasonable shipping options. Both employees i dealt with were hospitable and friendly.
2 Nobody likes running around for the services they offer. I was visiting from California and yelped this location for notary. One employee and she was patiently helping a guy but then people just started coming in one after the other. It was warm inside and after about 5 min of waiting for her to finish the guy in front of us it was becoming a frustrating situation. After 10 minutes of sweating because AC was off she finally asked owner to help. She should have asked him a long time ago. For a business as such not only is reasonable service expected but necessary. Not having the AC on made it worse so if you are going to be slow at least make it comfortable.
