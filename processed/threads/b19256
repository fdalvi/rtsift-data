5 Placed in a small little house on Regina Streeth North, this little restaurant is in conjunction with a Buddhist temple. The atmosphere is very serene and relaxing. Food is fairly cheap as well for the amount that you get. I would definitely recommend the Fruit Tea. It's to die for!
5 I've been here a couple times with my girlfriend, and we always walk away full and happy.  The food is pretty good. If you're looking for some good vegetarian/vegan food this is the place to get it. Or if you're just looking for some tasty, healthy food. Its pretty affordable as well.  The thing I like the most about this place is the tea. They have a full menu page of different types of teas to choose from. The fruit tea is a great one to start with. It takes a little while for it to get to the table, but that has to do with the amount of effort they put into brewing it. All the teas taste amazing, and they make you feel really good afterward.  The only thing I would criticize is that their menu can be a little sparse when compared with other larger restaurants. But they are a small place after all.  Overall, the tea alone earns them 5 stars from me.
5 I was pleasantly surprised with this tea house that a friend recommended.   We were greeted quickly at the door and seated.  The selection of teas was different than any other place I have been.  Our appetizers came out quickly.  The soup was outstanding and the bean sprout salad was great.  I started to get a little full when our meal arrived.  The presentation was very nice.  The temperature and taste of the food was perfect for me.   I recommend this place for anyone who wants to try something new.
5 I absolutely love this restaurant. Tasty food, polite and nice staff. Ordered something and mentioned it did not match my taste, then the staff immediately gave me a new dish for free. For a place that charges only 7-9$/dish (which includes appetizer bean sprouts and soup), this is amazing. I love their soya nuggets and dumplings!
