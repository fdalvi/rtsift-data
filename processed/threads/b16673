5 Dropped by to pick up boxes for my move. The customer service is really above and beyond. I can't recommend them enough!
5 I am always in need of storage space, and Storage One is just down the street from me. Managers Richard and Dee are wonderful, and you couldn't ask for more helpful people.  They are fast, courteous, and very accommodating. During a little personal emergency they kindly let me use an empty space to organize my stuff for shipping. This was unexpected and highly appreciated, and saved the day for me.    In the scorching heat of Las Vegas's summer, I was even given a bottle of cold water!  It is this kind of personalized service that will keep me coming back for all my storage needs, and recommending Storage One to all my friends.   Thanks Richard and Dee!!!  Walt
5 First up, I have never used a storage unit at this location before, but I have used this facility to rent a U-Haul truck and purchase moving supplies a couple times now.  I used them a long time ago when I moved into my current house and had a great experience.  It was prior to my Yelping days, so sorry for the late review!    We are going to be moving again soon, so I have been down there a couple of times buying boxes and moving stuff.  The people I have encountered so far are friendly and helpful.  The gentleman working today, even loaded my trunk up with all of the boxes I had purchased.  It's always nice when a company goes that extra step to help their customers out.    I would definitely recommend this place for your moving supplies.  They people are super nice, so I am sure their entire business is run in the same fashion.
