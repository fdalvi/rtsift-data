5 I can honestly say that Atlas security group will fix or repair anything that you want safe. I am a local business owner and we have had so many problems with our front door, Atlas security fixed it with out blinking an eye.   Atlas security group is a family owned business that prides themselves on quality products and exceptional customer service. It amazes me that in Las Vegas quality customer service almost does not exist, I am very proud to say that if I need another Safe, lock or security camera I will not hesitate to go with Atlas. Thank you for keeping my store safe and always servicing us with a huge smile.  #professional #fast #amazing
5 EXCELLENT!! Atlas gave us great locksmith service, FAST, and for a very fair price!   I needed a house re-keyed and was hoping to do it before I left for a day of errands. I called several locksmiths in Vegas and asked how soon they could do the job and what would they charge. Most could not do it soon and the one that could, quoted me $150. When I called Atlas next, they sounded busy but I explained my situation and the woman on the phone gave great customer service and said she'd get someone to the house before my meeting. In a short while a young man named Jason called to let me know he was on his way. That was reassuring. He arrived quickly and did a great job. His communication was excellent and his work was efficient. The cost was very fair and to be honest, much less than the highest quotes. I will continue to call Atlas when I need lock smithing work!
5 Locked myself out of the house this morning, called Atlas and they were at my home in a very short amount of time. Sammy was a life saver and the pricing was very reasonable!
