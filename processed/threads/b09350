5 The owners have been doing this for 35 years I'm told... they decided they are simply done with it. They plan to stay open for a couple more months - selling things off at big discounts.   This is a wonderful store and it's definitely a shame to be losing it. The store is filled to the rafters in old and new books. They also have a hodge podge of various trinkets and whatnot. You can get antique doorknobs here, random golf clubs or old 35mm cameras. It's somewhat of an antique shop, but mostly a book store.   Whether you have been there before or not, you really owe it to yourself to check it out. Even if you don't buy anything, just go. If you have been there before - go take one last look around... tell them you appreciate them.   Walking into the store is like getting hugged by grandma - go hug it back.
5 So as we were driving down Mill, I saw this store and had to drop by.  The fiance should be glad that I wasn't in the store too long and that I made a great effort at not looking at all the books they had.  I could spend days  and do a lot of damage in here.    The store is awesome and I wish I could visit it again, but it will be closed the next time I am in town.
5 Every time I stepped foot in this store I felt as though I had entered Stephen King's "Needful Things". I just knew between all those books there would be an item I wanted more than anything else and would sacrifice everything to have. Luckily for me the store closed and I never had to kill anyone. I fondly miss the discounted and quirky book selection. This was a fun place to waste an hour or so..
