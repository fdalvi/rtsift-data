4 This review is based entirely on their cosmic bowling.  Holy mother of God, this place had to have had the most random and diverse selection of music and bowlers on the planet! It was entertaining, inspiring and perplexing all at once.  Each lane was populated by a different set of folks. Black kids on 10, suburban white family on 13, emos on 9, Messicans on 5, and our lane - two lezbos and a teen boy. The whole place was almost an exact cross-section of my neighborhood.  And the music! Some hip hop, then fluffy pop or some such, then a Norte√±o ballad, a country tune, some 80s music, an old dance club anthem. It was utterly schizophrenic.  I liked it. And hated it. I don't even know anymore.  Once the "family" lady behind the bar started serving up the drinks, I just didn't care anymore. It was just plain fun. Plus I bowled an excellent game.
4 Very friendly staff, even tho it was only 3 of them. They still did a great job. $8 for unlimited bowling & covers your food. Good rock music while I was there but will be going back.
2 Place was not clean- tables were dirty, bathrooms were horrible. Too close for comfort at the lanes when bowling next to another family.
