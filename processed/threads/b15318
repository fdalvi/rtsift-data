4 We have been a few times now. The bagels are pretty good as are the sandwiches. The folks working are always very nice, not always the quickest but never too bad of a wait.
4 This is our go-to spot for breakfast whenever we are making the early trip out to California.  The place is located in a run of the mill strip mall out in Avondale, and it is pretty easy to get to from the freeway.  The bagel selection here is pretty good, rivaling that of the other well known bagel places.  My favorite bagel here is the honey oat.  The nice thing I have noticed is they make the bagels in small batches so you are guaranteed the freshest bagel.  The breakfast sandwiches are pretty good and extremely filling.  The cream cheese selection is also pretty decent, but don't expect any of those light and fluffy types.  If you are out and about in this part of town and feel like a bagel, you should give this place a try.  The staff is always nice and friendly and you never have to wait too long.
4 I stumbled upon BAB's when I was looking for coffee when I first got to Avondale and I go back a few times a week.    Friendly people, great bagels and awesome bagel sandwiches!
4 This is a great bagel shop. Very friendly and the bagels are the freshest I've had.  It is frequented by locals who have many other options in this growing area. Serve yourself from many fresh coffee choices. You'll love Big Apple Bagels. Parking is convenient too.
5 A little place tucked away in a strip mall, well worth a stop for a great bagel sandwich. Get a toasted bagel, they are the perfect consistency for a sandwich.
5 Great bagel sandwiches and pretty fair prices also.
4 Went here a few weeks ago. Good food at good prices. I only wish it was a bit more cozy of an atmosphere.
4 To bad thy are out of business ;o(
