1 Smelled much better from outside than in.  Taste was so poor, I will not be returning! Steamed rice was so flavorless! The noodles were flat-flavored... The only semi-decent part was the BBQ pork... And it was definitely not good enough to make me want to return-- ever! Just avoid the foods 2 go!
3 For a quick bite after leaving the market I would definitely give this place a try.  I did however NOT like it the first time I came here over a year ago but decided to try it once more.  Pretty good! Nice pricing and I would probably recommend when ordering the dim sum try getting there before lunch time because when we did everything tasted as it would fresh out if the steamer.  I am definitely a fan, not 5 star raving fan but still I would come back and get some more food from them if in the area.  I would however recommend that they elaborate on the dim sum selection.  It was delicious but not much variety.
