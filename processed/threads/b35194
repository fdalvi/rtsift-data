3 $18.99 gets you a margarita souvenir in the shape of the Eiffel Tower. They only have margarita, strawberry, and pina colada flavors. Avoid mixed drinks. The $9 jack and coke is a small premixed bottle.
4 The Arc Bar is a small cafe that sits in front of the Paris Casino playing all the latest Top 40 songs. The bartender hooked our drinks up when we told him we was from NY just like him. We both bought the $18.99 souvenir cups, one being a tall clear plastic Eiffel tower and a ceramic Paris globe thing... Be very careful on how you hold the Eiffel Tower because in seconds you could be wearing your drink as well as others around you.
4 My girlfriend and I stopped here on our last night in Vegas, after seeing nice tall Eiffel tower souvenir cups people were walking away with. Warning: These things are Strong! I had a margarita tower, and I almost had to buy some juice to even it out. They are literally pumped and the bottle of alcohol is squeezed into the tower.   Be careful with how you hold it however, the top is prone to falling off. And if it falls, the bottom will most likely crack and leak, while the top of the tower abrupts like a volcano.  Cheers
