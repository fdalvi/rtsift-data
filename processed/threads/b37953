5 What is better than spending some time with young professionals? Spending time with young professionals that love and worship my Jesus the way I do!   The first and third Tuesday you could find your way to North Phoenix Baptist Church for some praise and worship, some of the Word of God, and some new friends!   I know Christianity is not everyone's thing and neither is this review :)   But if you are in your 20s/30s looking for a home church love to sing and dance in His name PhoenixOne is the event for you. There is always tons of great ways to connect with churches and other organizations!   Hope to see you there!
5 EPIC!  Such a refreshing experience.  God centered, yet age relevant and a great message that is taught from scripture.  The worship and scenery was so great at PhoenixONE.  Most importantly this seems like an authentic place to build Christ centered relationships and make new friends.
5 It is pretty amazing that you can get together with young professionals first & third Tuesday of every month and worship for a couple of hours.  Every time I come I always fill so much better and I get to meet cool people that like to worship too.    They moved the location to the City of Grace Downtown location in Downtown Phoenix. The church is pretty old, but it is amazing inside the church.     If you like to worship and want to meet cool Christians you should come sometime.  :)
