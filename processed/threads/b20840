5 YES THEY ARE!  The sheer amount of choice you have in this place is crazy. From a single arch canopy for a wedding party to a 10ft inflatable scary ass clown for your trip to the children's hospital, this place has you covered.  I genuinely believe that these guys can make anything out of balloons, which is why after 5 minutes of questioning I was banned for life.
5 First tip - with Edinburgh winds, get the weights so your balloons don't take you off!  This is a fab wee place and as it was my niece's birthday last week, conversation had turned to trying to find suitable balloons, and then I remembered seeing this place on my travels.  It does what it says on the tin - it is all about the balloons. From little balloons to huge children sized Disney characters, this place does it all. It does have to be seen to be believed. If you are having any kind of event (weddings, christenings, birthdays, etc) then you must come here.  There are prices to suit all budgets and also accessories for different occasions such as Hen nights, etc. I went for 2 Balloons - a huge cupcake for a 1st birthday and a large Disney balloon. I was beginning to wish I had the car parked outside (the girls in store had asked me this) but they were able to provide a huge bag where the balloons were packed inside so I could get them home, without the two of them taking me off. It was a windy day and I thought in the case of Claire vs Balloons, they might win despite the amount of cake I have been eating recently, such was their size.   The balloons last an average of 7 days so if you have a child who loves certain types of cartoon characters then this is an enchanting and unusual extra to a gift - my one year old niece just kept looking up in awe at the balloons.  So, great service and fab products. I'll definitely be back when the occasion calls!
