5 My car was running rough, so I asked a friend where to get it repaired. He gave me a name of a garage that specialized in Cadillacs.  When I went to the garage, the owner said it probably needed spark plugs but was too much work for him and would not do the job. I went to Tech ! Auto and asked the owner to look at the car. He told me it needed spark plugs and he could do it that day. I got the car back running great. Fred stated he can do any kind of work on autos or trucks and come back anytime. That is the kind of company I want working on my vehicles, not someone selective on what he is willing to do.
