4 You kind of have to go here to determine if it is your thing.
5 I had to drag my husband out of here kicking and screaming. Its a really cool place with tons to explore. I found it interesting as well.  Military stuff Camping gear  Old signs Old school Playboy collection Vintage tools Records  Etc, etc, etc....   Ladies -- Its in a really cool shopping plaza with about 6-7 other thrift store/boutiques.   You'll both be happy!
3 Found some great vinyl and browsed tons of beautiful junk.  What a treat.  And free Wifi!
5 WOW! I visit this place once a month. It is not your typical "antique" or "thrift" store. They sell Absolutely anything and everything that you could be interested in.  -Photography supplies and vintage cameras -New and vintage tools - LOTS of magazines, tin signs, and old road maps - Sci-fi and a few geek toys  - Knives - Records -Military, hunting, fishing, and camping gear - Automobile parts and posters - Furniture -Everything else!  In short, I love this place. It's an awesome place for anyone, but it is an especially great place for guys to shop. I buy my guy friends gifts there all the time!  The prices are fair. For the most part, they are pretty competitive with ebay prices and other thrift shops.
5 Great place bought some signs for my shop and they look great I will be returning maybe even tomorrow. If your looking for cool,tools,antiques,military, or basically anything then go in there. I will definitely recommend to a friend
3 Selection is amazing with tons of awesome vintage stuff oriented towards guys, so 5 stars on that but prices are pretty much retail. If you want to find a deal or are looking for 'old junk' this isn't your place. But if you want to find some clean old stuff and don't mind paying a premium you will love it if you are a man
5 Super cool shop. Great for finding unique items. It's like a yard sale specifically for guys.
