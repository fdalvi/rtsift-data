2 After seeing their advertisement in Seven Magazine, I was determined to try this place because I'm a suckah for lobstah!  There are two locations in town: one in Anthem and one on Eastern and Serene. We had some trouble finding the one on Serene because it is inside Doc Holliday's and there isn't a lot of light. It is a lot bigger than it appears from the outside.   I started with a cup of seafood chowder. It had potential because it was flavorful but it was served lukewarm and it wasn't as thick as I'd like. I ordered the U Conn Roll which was full of succulent lobster inside a warm roll. It came with a side of fries. My husband ordered the lobster mac and cheese and it was disappointing. It tasted like boxed Kraft mac and cheese with chunks of lobster.  The only redeeming thing about this place is that I enjoyed my lobster roll. Service was just okay. I think this place has potential but I won't go out of my way to go back again with all of my other options in town.
2 After reading a glowing report in the RJ, we gave it a try. Went to the Serene location inside Doc Holidays Saloon.  Food was great, but service was lousy. The server was nice but she didnt refill our drinks or check on us ( at one point we were the only customers...)   Place was a bit dirty and smokey.  While the food was good,  everything else was not.  Whover is managing the place needs to work harder.  Too many better places to go, especially in that area.
1 Horrible!! Six of us went out for dinner, we got soup, salad, 3 lobster dinnahs, the samplah, mozzerella sticks for the kiddos and mac & cheese.    Of course the soups, salads and the girls' food came out first.  I liked how they put little blueberries on the salads and the mozzerella sticks were pretty generic.  The soup came out cold so it had to be sent back to be reheated.  Our friends' daughter didn't like the mac & cheese so we went to send it back.  The waitress came over and said "Well, it's homemade."  Aside from it being a very rude comment, who cares if it's homemade if she doesn't like it?!    All 3 of the lobster dinnahs were cold so they had to send it back as well to be reheated.  They must cook a bunch of lobster all at once and then reheat them, which doesn't do anything for the taste or the tenderness of the meat.  It didn't taste very good in the first place and it was even worse when it came back out - I couldn't eat it at all.   No wonder this place was dead when we walked in - blatantly rude staff, cold, tasteless food...  I will NEVER make the mistake of coming here again!  Final words: Spend a few $ more and go to Joe's Crab Shack.
5 First-timer here...and I was SO GLAD they had options for the NON-Lobstah fan! I know, I know...you're probably thinking why would I even go to a restaurant with the name lobster in it, if I am not a lobster-fan!? BUT, in my defense, it was for a business meeting and I didn't choose the location.  However, I had a really great BURGER! The staff was friendly, Carol in particular was funny and gave great service!  I'd go again...and I think I'll try the Chicken Quesadilla next! lol...
3 Despite the many mixed reviews, we decided to try this place anyways.  With a name like monstah lobstah, they have to know what they are doing, with lobsters at least...  We walked into the restaurant on a Sunday evening and because it shares an entrance with Doc Hollidays (separated by another door), you will get attack with the cigarette smoke smell.  Once inside, it looks quite cheesy, with red and white checkered table cloths.  This place was empty!  Bad sign.  So after we got seated, the person who attended to us was quite a good seller.  However, we stuck with the basics.  Two lobster of 2.5 lb each, 1lb of clams, and I ordered the U-Conn Roll because I've read good reviews for it, even from reviewers that had given it one star.  Steamed clams - I have to peel off this outer layer of the end piece so that I won't be eating dirt.  It comes with a small bowl of clam juice/broth, but it didn't add much flavor for me.  I put some salt and pepper on a small dish, squeeze some lemon in it, and that was the accompanying sauce for the clams.  That brought out some flavor, and I enjoyed it.  The U conn roll was ok.  I liked the fat fries that were next to the roll, absorbing some of that buttah and they were GOOD.  How can anything w/butter be bad?!?  The lobster roll on the other hand was alright.  But, it was probably just me...I am not a fan of lobster.  The lobsters that the guys order were ok.  They had mentioned that those lobsters tasted as if though they have been boiled the life out of them.  Would have tasted better if they were steamed.  Well, all in all, it's aight.
1 This was the worst dining experience I have had. I should have known better when we were the ONLY table at 5:30 on a Sunday. I was looking forward to trying this restraunt since he came to Vegas. I went to the Henderson location on my birthday. It was AWFUL. It was dirty. The food was not edible. Our waitress Shawn brought out baked potatoes that were as brown inside as they were outside, the corn was old, the lobster was cold & rubery. My companion ordered the surf & turf, $24.99. The steak was like nothing I have ever seen. It was 1/4 inch thick, all light brown fat.. Allen Berube obviously doesn't go to his restraunts, and if he does he should be ashamed.
3 This is not a fancy lobster restaraunt, so if that is what you are looking for you will be dissapointed.  Despite what other reviews said we decided to give this place a shot.  The food was good. We have the chowder and bisque, both we piping hot, and yummy. Chowder was thinner that I prefer though.  I had the U-Conn Roll, which was LOADED with big chunks of lobster. It really curbed the craving that I have been having. My fiance had the lobster pasta. He said it was delicious, and would definitely order it again.  I ready some awful things about the service, and I seriously have nothing to complain about. Out waitress was really nice and quite attentive. The restaraunt was slow, so there was no fighting to get her attention.   Next time I have a hankering for a lobster roll, I will definitely head to Monstah Lobstah.
5 Love this place. If you like simple, unadulterated goodness and authenticity, this place is it. Yes, it's adjacent to a bar. Yes, it's no frills. But that's what makes it so good. Their known for their "Steamahs" & Lobsters, flown in from the east coast.   Prices you can't beat... $19.99 for a 1 1/4lb lobster dinner with 2 sides! And what a great deal, the UConn roll. I have fallen in love. They open up the whole lobster for you and stuff the meat of the 1 1/4lb lobster in a toasted roll with lettuce and butter. Ridiculous! why shell it yourself? Let them do it and the lobster is still warm when they serve it. The hush puppies are fantastic (better than the fries), and their Lobster Bisque is the real deal. They regularly have fresh 10+lb lobsters, and people often come as a group and share them (great idea- gonna have to call ahead for a big table and do this!).   I have overheard conversations from other tables on how good the food and prices are. Even had a few myself with other patrons and it's all the same. This is a place they will be coming back to. We have gone twice this week! Its a relaxing low key place to unwind and enjoy some TV and great grub. Besides the authentic food, the staff is relaxed, prompt and knowlegeable about the food in a great way. The kind of place where everyone's friendly, a true neighborhood hangout.   Watch for specials ($2 fish taco tuesdays) and get on their Facebook asap!!! This needs to be a must try. Hope they get enough business to stick around a while. I'm torn with telling people about my great find, I don't want to have to wait for my table if they do get busier!!! LOL   :Best Tail in Town!" Monstah Lobstah!!
5 Great Mother's Day special ($59.99 for 2ea of 2lb lobsters - HUGE - 2 sides, 2 desserts and 2 coffees). I have never had a lobster so large, but it was perfectly cooked and delicious. The kids fish stick was actually a large piece of sliced fish, which was great. No yucky minced up crap. Was a bit dissapointed that they didnt have any of their chocolate cake for the dessert, but they did have complimentary champagne, which was sweet.   They pushed the tables together for our group, and having the kids in a relaxed atmosphere was relieving.  I hope they can get some more staff quickly for holidays. And make sure your wait staff knows what is out of stock for the day in advance. But the staff is so sweet and genuine, one can hardly be upset at them.   It seems every time we go, more and more people are there. People may be finding out about my lil secret dive hot spot! Oh no! :)
1 Went there for lunch and the place had only 2 tables with other patrons  ( should have walked out then). We were told to sit anywhere and the waiter would bring us menus--well after 5 minutes the waiter finally realized we were waiting for menus. Ordered the U conn lobster roll--the meat was like chewing rubber- but the fries were really good. The service was horrible-the waiter never came back to see if we needed anything, We had no spoon to stir our coffee. We had to go up to the counter to get our check. Very disappointed
4 A good friend took me there for dinner,  I love seafood, I really enjoyed dinner!  For being in the desert the lobster was wonderful I had the Ucon roll it was simple and yummy!  Chunks of lobster on a toasted roll with melted butter and fries.  The lobster was cooked perfect and tasted awesome!   I followed it up with a cup of lobster bisque creamy and hot loved it!  Stole a hush puppy from my friend and it was awesome too, also got to try the lobster quesadilla, everything we tried was great.  I would recommend this place anytime  and to those who say the sandwich didn't have a pound and fourth of lobster should know lobster is sold and weighed IN THE SHELL so that adds to it just FYI
1 This place blows! I'm still trying to figure out how a place can ruin something you dip in melted butter...but these guys were able to manage it.
4 **Summary**        - U Conn Roll was good. The Lobstah dinner was great. **Price**        - $45 for 2 **Ordered**        - U Conn Roll - Very good. Perfectly toasted bun and seasoned fries that were cooked just right. The lobster chunks were a tad bit chewy though.        - Lobstah Dinnah - Moist lobster dipped in melted butter. Need I say more. **Recommendations**        - I'd come back for the Lobstah Dinnah
1 Fresh seafood? No I ordered the shrimp and for the $13.00 I got frozen sea pak style shrimp, crinkle cut frozen fries, wilted tasteless to go cup of coleslaw. My girl got the Lobsta dinner which was a little better but not much. Veggies drowned in butter and soggy. Service just terrible. I won't go back that is for sure!
4 Used a Groupon.  The lobster dinner was fine and the service was good.  I had the hush puppies and veggies and they were done right.  My wife had the baked potato and coleslaw.  The potato was not well cooked and the coleslaw wasn't good. The main dish, lobster, was tasty, fresh and cooked right. The seafood chowder was good but the serving was small for $5.  The side salad was very good with greens, blueberries and grape tomatoes.  The food is all served in disposables, paper towels for napkins but it works fine. Prices were pretty reasonable.
1 this place is terrible. The food quality and lobster were very poor. The service was awful and when we went there it wasn't very busy. This place is a poor excuse for a Maine lobster restaurant. I felt the prices and value were terrible as well. I will never go back and was utterly disappointed. This place sucks!!!
3 Finally got around to using my coupon for this place.  While the food was tasty, the portions were small.  We had UConn rolls and a cup of clam chowder.  If not for the coupon, the prices charged would have been way to much for the amount of food given. Tasty (but pricey) food Service was friendly but slow. (There were only 3 tables of customers and 2 servers.)
4 I had the lobstah dinner which was average.  The lobstah, cauliflower, and baked potato were all okay.  My husband had the chicken parmesean - not the best.  While it was a large portion and he could only eat half of it, we didn't bother to bring the rest home.  For dessert I had a cannoli - simply THE best.  That changed the entire experience for me:  dessert nirvana!!  Next time, I'll get the lobster roll and a cannoli - yum.
3 I'm giving this place 3.5 stars.  This was my third visit.  The first two were NOT good, but I bought a Groupon to try it once more and was pleasantly surprised on try number three.  I had the Lobstah Mac and Cheese.  The mac and cheese on it's own was nice and creamy with a lovely light panko bread crumb crust on the top.  There was just enough decent size lobster chunks to go around, nothing crazy, but not stingy either.    I am still bothered by the lack of clientele during my three visits even though they were all at peak lunch or dinner times.  When I arrived the counter guy was helping someone who was picking up an order and I stood there for several minutes before he acknowledged me and told me to sit anywhere (in the empty restaurant) and pointed to where the menus were and said I should grab one.  Another party of three people arrived while I was seated and the counter guy was STILL helping the pick-up person and did not acknowledge them either.  They finally seated themselves.  Service is not attentive for the fact that practically NO ONE was in there on all three of my visits.    I would like to go back for the Lobstah Mac and Cheese again and possibly to try the fried whole belly clams, but am hesitant for the service and the fact that my fiance had generic frozen fried shrimp on our last visit.  "shrug"  They REALLY need to step it up to compete in this town.  Lots of East Coasters are looking for authentic food and they would go through the roof if they hit it right.
3 Sunday afternoon lobsta fest !  Noticed the mixed reviews but the gf was Hankering for a lobster roll and my go to spot is  closed-on Sunday.  We got :  Lobster bisque - $4.99 Lobster roll - $16 Lobster salad roll - $8 Lobster Mac and cheese - $16  The good -  service was good ( contrary to what I've read ) - pleasant server, timely , food was hot . The lobster roll was decent but why in a tortilla and it might be a little pricey for the amount of meat.  The average - bisque had decent flavor, a little on the thick side .  Mac n cheese - started out very average but it's actually much better later when the sauce hardens a little and the flavors meld.  The bad - not necessarily bad , let's say below avg - the lobster salad roll - not much lobster flavor going on here   They have various seafood options that might be worth a try - will I come back ? Yeah - I'll give it another shot  pics attached
4 I had a very different experience here.  First of all, it is rare to find a place that serves a whole Maine lobster - and at a reasonable price.  Secondly, when you do find one, they tend to overcook the lobster, making it tough and rubbery.  Not here!  I had a 2 lb lobster, perfectly cooked and delicious.  I am tough to please so I'm not going to say that the entire experience was marvelous.  The place was packed when we went so there was a wait - no complaint here - it is what it is.  But the service was slow, wait staff didn't seem to understand that when you order coffee, you might want occasional refills.  The ambience is not great but who cares when you can get this much good food for so little?!
5 This place is definitely a no frills restaurant, and I love it for that. You don't have to pay exorbitant amounts of money to enjoy some seafood, lobster in particular. The tables are covered with red and white checkered picnic table cloths and they serve drinks in Styrofoam cups. That was okay with me, because I wasn't looking for anything fancy. I just wanted some good food.  The food was not good. It was amazing! I had the lobster mac n cheese, and my bf had the chicken parm. This mac n cheese was probably the best restaurant mac n cheese I've ever had. I usually think restaurant mac n cheese is sub par to homemade. It tends to be dry and flavorless. No, this mac n cheese was made with Gouda and other types of cheese making it incredibly creamy and flavorful. I could not get enough of it. They did not skimp on the lobster either. My dish was filled with a large amount of delicious chunks of sweet, tender lobster. My bf also liked his chicken parm. It was flavorful and was a huge portion. The prices were also very good. I think we each paid about $15. They have super cheap sandwiches for about $5 if seafood isn't your thing.  The service was wonderful too. Our waiter was friendly and constantly made sure we had enough soda to wash down our food with. We were impressed and will be returning.
3 In honor of national lobster day, which was June 15 , I decided to give Monstah Lobstah a try. OK, I actually ate there a day or two prior, but it was close enough. This outpost of Monstah Lobstah is located inside Doc Holliday's and as you would expect there's plenty of Boston memoribilia around the room, along with red/white checkered tablecloths, wooden seats and booths that give it that New England feel.  I went with their UConn roll ($17.99, although their web site says it's $16.99), which was filled with a 1 1/4 lb lobster-worth of meat in a toasted hot dog-like bun with lettuce. It was lightly dressed with butter but was a little dry. It could have benefitted from having a side of clarified butter that I could apply as needed (quite the opposite experience of my roll at Rocco's).  For those looking for a roll where the lobster is in a mayo-based mix with celery, green onions, etc. they have a lobster salad roll for $7.99.  My UConn roll was pretty good, but not as amazing as I had hoped. Not a big fan of the crinkle cut fries either. The value is decent for the amount of meat you get, but I'm not sure I'd get it again.
3 Almost missed this place as I didn't know it was inside of Doc Holiday's. Blink, and you might miss it!   I ordered the crab dinnah. The crab legs were cooked very well and seasoned with Old Bay. Perfect-o! I would def reccomend and get again. My boyfriend got the lobster bisque served in a bread bowl. Bisque was easily a 4 out of 5 and the bread was super yummy. Total for food would be a 4-5 out of 5.  The service... sucked! The waiter at the other table seemed to be very friendly and talked with his tables. Our had less personality than a brick. After he brought our food, it took less than a minute for him to ask how our food was. Uh let us get a taste before you ask. After that, we didn't see him again until he came to get a plate. My drink we empty and didn't get refilled, which I drink a ton. Luckily, I always have back up in my purse. Even after walking passed our table with more dirty plates, clearly not being eaten off of, and seeing me drink out of a reusable water bottle, he didn't take any other plates or offer refills. At this point, a man had walked in and helped him self to drink and went back an forth from the kitchen to the counter. After 10 minutes of waiting and looking for someone to flag down since our waiter was MIA, I went to this new person who walked in assuming they worked there and asked for our waiter to bring our check. When our waiter appeared, no apology and didnt ask if we needed anything else. Just grabbed plates and left our check on the table. If it wasn't for the service, we would definitely be back and I would give this place a better rating. Too bad we didn't get the friendly waiter... Total for service brings my rating down to a 2.5-3 rating.   They do have a Tuesday night special for all you can eat crab legs and $2 fish tacos that I would have liked to try.
3 I really wanted to like this place, I love lobster and the guy working (the owner?) was great - friendly, enthusiastic and seemed to really want to bring the new England experience to Vegas.   I thought the restaurant itself was ok - their blasting ac was a nice escape from the summer heat. Seats were really padded and super comfy. I thought it was cute that they had their condiment bottles in old 6pack carriers.   I got the lobster salad roll for $7.99 I didn't expect too much for the price and it wasn't the best, but wasn't bad. The bread was good - perfectly buttered and toasted, he said they just started shipping the rolls in from I think maine? So like I said, they do care and they are trying.   I love that they had crinkle fries, I'm sick of this whole shoestring fries thing so many places have going on. Crinkle fries remind me of elementary school lunch - the star of every craptastic meal. Also had the fried scallop appetizer $7 or $8 I can't remember. They were pretty good - a decent portion, hand breaded w panko. They may need to change their oil because it had a weird after-taste like old oil.   I'm honestly not sure that I'll be back. They've been open long enough to work out the kinks, but the reviews are mostly the same - ok but not great when this is a place specializing in lobster.
4 Ok Ok Ok... I'm reading the rest of these reviews and everyone needs to calm down. I grew up in Marblehead, Massachusetts...I worked on lobster boats and have been to countless lobster shacks on the East Coast. I think some of the reviews are a tad picky. Here's the good bad & ugly from my point of view.   The Good -  We are in the middle of the Nevada desert and I was sitting in a restaurant eating fresh steamers and a lobster roll with all authentic ingredients. That alone is amazing. The waitress told me they fly in the rolls, the fries, the clams...I would normally say that the prices were a tad steep but it's got to be expensive and a gigantic pain in the ass to coordinate all that importing. My family had steamers that were FRESH. I had the uConn roll which was very filling. The roll tasted like home, the fries reminded me of my elementary school cafeteria (good thing) and the lobster was spilling out of this thing...delicious. I will say that the lobster was just a smidge dry but hey, still great. My mom had fried clams that melted in your mouth and my wife had the Lobster Grilled Cheese... to say she loved it is an understatement...I actually heard moaning.   You have to appreciate the effort and authenticity of this joint. The lobsters are in a tank so you know it's not canned or some frozen dead stuff before it arrived on your plate. Most East Coast places (not the tourist crap) are shacks by the water with no frills...Monstah Lobstah is a fair representation.   I also saw some comments regarding service. The server we had was super nice and answered all of my obnoxious questions...then again, we were the only group in the place.   The Bad -  Lobster bisque was a little on the dull side... sorry but it was. I was a little put off by all the Styrofoam as well...get some glasses!   The Ugly -  It's attached to a Doc Holiday's...smoke filled nasty bar with that faint (people are getting lung cancer nearby) smell. Not pleasant when you are eating. I also gotta say that the lack of signage and location are big problems...you better be doing some serious marketing to counteract the bad location and nonexistent visibility.   All in all... I'm a fan and will be back. I can't get anything close to this in Vegas and I'm excited that I found my new lobstah haven.
4 I needed to get away from the strip for a bit so I slipped away from Aria and found myself at Monstah Lobstah, which is located inside of a Doc Holliday's just off the 215.  I have to say...it really wasn't bad.  The place was completely empty at noonish on a Saturday, but the guy took the time to even show me the lobster pool.  Very nice.  ;-)  Anyway, I had the UConn and the Lobstah Salad.  The UConn was actually quite nice.  This version has no mayo and is basically lightly seasoned lobster meat on a bun.  What's nice about it is that it comes with clarified butter at the side so you can add as much as you want.  I've been to some places where the entire roll and lobster meat is just drenched in butter and while some people can never have too much butter (or bacon), I do have my limits.  Because of this, this was actually one of the nicer lobster rolls that I ever had.  The lobster salad sandwich was not so great to me.  The salad mix was too salty and the meat didn't really taste or feel like lobster to me.  In fact, I would swear that much of it consisted of surimi/krab/crab-flavored-pollock or whatever they call that fake crab stuff.  If I'm incorrect and have slandered this sandwich, someone tell me and I'll correct this review.  Regardless, UConn strong yes, lobster salad definitely no.  Lastly, the fries were surprisingly crisp for krinkle-cut fries.  As far as such fries go, they weren't bad.  In fact, I ate quite a few of them.   Based on the UConn (and lobster tank!), I think that this place deserves more than three stars.
1 This review is for the S. Eastern location. . . . We will never go back. First of all, the service, sucks. There was only one waitress working on a saturday dinner shift. We wanted beer with our dinner so the waitress had to go into the ajoining bar to buy them @ $4.00 a bottle (miller lite). RIP-OFF!! The food came out at seperate times and was only so-so. Didn't come close to the price tag thats for sure. There are MUCH better places to get quality sea food in Las Vegas. If you were thinking about giving Monstah Lobstah a try, you've been warned.
4 All. You. Can. Eat. Crab. Legs.  (We'll come back to that part... are you hungry yet?)  I have had the lobster enchiladas and was a bit "meh" over them. Not bad, necessarily, but I expected more. The sandwhiches have all gotten rave reviews from my tablemates. A simple order of crab or lobster has always been good.  The salad has always been fresh except, admittedly, one night I wanted a little coleslaw to go... and I got a very little sample-pack size and it was not fresh and way heavy on the mayo. That made me a bit wary. But each time since then, it has been crisp, fresh, and tangy without being doused in mayo.   I love their bisque and clam chowder and, as I said opening this post, I love the AYCE crab on Tuesday nights.  It's always hot, fresh, and tasty. You get a ton of crab and all the tools you need to dig into it. They offer all the extras if you want them: butter, coleslaw, fries, etc. Not for me, though... I am a purist. Give me the crab, and no one gets hurt. Legs, claws, and bodies; freshly steamed and brought to the table steaming hot and with a lot of lemon. A bit messy, and totally worth every paper towel and wet towlette on the table.  There are no limits, as I have witnessed in a group setting... As long as you keep ordering it, they will bring it to you. A table for two? No problem. A table for 8? No problem. And always with a smile.  Service has been slow on occasion, but it's always friendly, personable, and dedicated to making sure you have what you want and enough of it to make you happy.  Oh.... Do not miss some of the pastas... the crab mac n' cheese my friend had a few weeks ago made me miss mac n' cheese something FIERCE! It was amazing!   A great go-to-spot for eating in or taking out. Doc Holliday's being connected, there is also full bar service. It's handy to have, let me tell ya...  ... and I will; maybe I'll see you on a Tuesday!
4 Oyster joint. Check. Shrimp and crab joint. Check. Finally a lobster joint. CHECK! i tried them last night and i must say, they have satisfied my cravings for lobster, and I think their in dire need of a more generous review.  I had the 7.99 lobster salad wrap, and the Lobstah Bisque. If you're looking for a less messy meal definitely do the wrap. The roll isn't really a roll but more of like a a big bruschetta concept with ONE piece of toast and then the salad on top. Which kind of turned me off since I think they were going for an appealling look rather than better eating ingenuity. I think the roll would be awesome with TWO pieces of toast for the sandwich. Definitely a light and soft taste of the salad, but very filling due to the lobster chunks and mayo. My favorite is the bisque. Tangy with an awesome kick to the taste with a lot of big lobster chunks! Yes! 5 stars for the bisque for me.  The service was good, not great. He did fail to add in our utensils into the bag, and silly me to check it after we left. So we had no spoon, napkins, or ketchup in our to go bag which I though was like was second nature for them to do. The guy was funny and witty, and definitely passionate about the food there seeming slightly offended by the partial yelp reviews he's read. lol But, I will say he let me keep the ketchup bottle since I asked for ketchup to go which I thought was nice and funny since he didn't want me waiting. So he makes up for the service with the ketchup bottle.
4 The woman wasn't even in there when we came in, then she came in, and was so cute with her lobstery top and lobstery pants...we ordered the lobster dishes...they arrived, with a poutine of melted butter and a juicy helping of love, and the rest, as they say, is lobstery.
4 Lobstah mac & cheese and the 2lbs. to share - heaven!
3 Came here specifically for the U Conn Roll.  NFL playoff were going on so we at in the bar.  Crinkle cut fries reminded me of, uh, yeah, crinkle cut fries that I had as a child.  Har! har!  Actually, the fries were better because as a child, the crinkle fries were always soggy.  These fries were crisp outside and fluffy in the middle.  Sad to say the U Conn roll I ate was was OK.  The bun was toasted right but the lobster was overcooked.  There was a fair amount of lobster meat but it was tough and dry.  All that needed to be done was to cook the lobster correctly.    Unfortunately, I left still craving lobster but that was satisfied another day during my stay in Vegas.  Which will be in another review.  Regarding the service, the waitress and bartender were very nice and made it an enjoyable experience.
1 Our first vist several months ago was grim. The lobster was chewy, the frozen fries are dreadful and the bisque was nothing like I have ever tasted. And I am from New England. But as we do, we always give restaurnts 2 trys to make sure that it wasn't an off service. We visited this weekend and it was worse that we expected. Lunch time and no one in the restaurant. The fried scallops were cold and fried in oil that needed filtering. The boiled shrimp were very small and fishy smelling. Both of these apps. were served on chopped pieces of wilted lettuce. But with a lovely novelity cut lemon wedge. They would be much better served spending time preparing good food and less time making carved lemon wedges. We had lobster salad rolls.Chewy pieces of lobster and an odd taste. We both got through about 1/2 a roll and could go no further. We got about 20 mins away from the restaurant  we both began to get ill. We both stayed ill for a day. It has been years since I have had food poisioning but once you have had it, you do not want it again I can assure you. We naturally will not be returning but we are so shocked by the positve reviews. Where did these people eat?
4 Thanks Monstah Lobstah for the yummy lobster salad rolls!  I always thought I'd somehow have to go to New England to get a lobster roll!  This was our second time and the rolls and service(thanks Robin!) were consistent.  The fries were so hot and crisp I could feel the heat radiating from them!    We'll be back for AYCE crab legs!
3 I came here for a lunch and they seemed like a pretty cool place. They have the whole Boston and New England sports / Seafood Red Lobster theme going on.  Really wanted to do the all you can eat cod, the Friday Special, but ended up just going with the Lobstah Salad Roll.  It was pretty small and kind of disappointing in size but I guess it's understandable since lobster isn't cheap, which explain the prices of most the menu.  The Lobstah Salad Roll taste wasn't that bad but had they used crab imitation or real I would have equally liked it.  Maybe they should offer a imitation or real crab salad roll same price but larger portion I'd buy it.  I left hungry and full of water.  They were very slow at bringing out the food don't know why cause it wasn't busy but they also looked short handed since there was just one guy in the front who was also the cashier, server, etc. He did separate the checks and have it ready before we finished eatting or even asked for it which was good.  The rest of their menu and specials do look good and they do seem like they can accommodate a large crowd so maybe I'll try them again during the March Madness or for a lobster dinner.
2 I don't know what happened, but AYCE Tuesdays are a bust for our crab-hungry group of friends. This makes me more than sad as it was a whole experience: food, drinks, environment, service... it all made for good times and a great meal. Tuesdays were our thing (as you can see from my last review).   Sadly, I haven't had a great meal here in a very long time.  I have done my "Feeling Crabby Tuesday" maybe... twice?... in the past couple of months: the crab is coming out with soft shells, it's over-salted, and it's just not as tasty as it once was. Sure, once in a while it would happen in the past, we would note it and point it out, and then all was well. Unfortunately it has become more the rule than the exception.   I said a while ago that I was done but then a couple weeks ago I had a yen for it. I convinced a girlfriend to go with me and.... no. Just... no. The crab was salty and soft-shelled (not the good kind) and just didn't live up to the previous amazingness that was the Tuesday siren-song for our seafood loving mates.  The bisque has also made me sad. The general flavor profile is still mostly good and, depending on your server, loaded with real lobster. But I have been able to see and taste the cornstarch (or other white powdery food thickener) in the soup the last two times I had it (in a bisque?!). Add to that the problem with the consistency being inconsistent? Ugh. One of my previous favorites, now off the list.   I tried changing to the clam chowder on a few occasions but it's just OK. Not bad, but not great. I wouldn't go there if I was specifically looking for CC.  One of the servers doesn't have a TAM card. While he is personable and genuinely interested in making your stay with them a good one, it is inconvenient to have to leave your table to get drinks for you and your friends from the attached Doc Holliday's Saloon. At that point, you are becoming your own server. Not why I go to a sit-down place.  Some highlights do exist... I am not trying to burn an effigy. The two stars come from some really good points - just that they are unfortunately weighed down by the rest. :(  Service is usually fast, friendly, and they are pretty good about communicating with you when the kitchen is processing a lot (think AYCE on Tuesday, if they are busy and have 15+ orders at a time). Sometimes you have to wait a minute, but speed isn't usually a problem.   The coleslaw is decent, as is the corn on the cob, the lobster salad, and the lobster escargot (buttery garlicy goodness!). The mac n' cheeses are rich and yummy (not my thing, but everyone I know who has tried them loves them). Everyone who eats them loves the fries, too!  I have had some of the Lobstah Dinnah and found the lobster to be sweet and tasty, if a little on the small side and just a tad salty but not overly so. It was definitely hot and fresh (we watched the little guy be picked from tank!).  ----  Only once did I have an issue with the overall evening to the point I asked for a concession. It was the food, yes, but also the attitude of the server that put us over the top. In the interest of honesty and fairness: they split the bill with us and we promised to come back. We did! A few times. This is written after many dissatisfied visits.   Sadly, I don't think there will be another one.
4 So I've been here a few times since the infamous day where there was just only 1 guy holding down everything in front during lunch, not a good day, I shall no longer talk about that day. Anyways to get the experience you just have to do a few things.   Come here on Mondays. 2 for 1 lobstah salad roll w/ fries and a soda are only $10 and some change.  Compared to their 1 lobstah salad roll w/ fries for about $8 this is a deal.   Call ahead worth it especially if what you're ordering something that suppose to be cold or warm, or if you already know what you want or if you're in a hurry. If you're not in a hurry I probably wouldn't worry about calling ahead.  Calling ahead is always basic if your trying to dine in a hurry.  Doing these things made my overall experience much better.  Calling ahead was actually suggested by the lady who worked there, possibly owner!?  So most recently we came there with a party of 7, when we got there they were almost ready for us.  They brought out the tray full of 12 lobstah salad roll and 7 fries.  The other 2 came out later but everything was excellent. Left full with lobstah salad rolls and fries. Good times.
3 This place is ok, not great and not bad. They have some good lunch specials through the week. When I'm in the mood it satisfies my craving for seafood. It can be a little understaffed at times which means don't go here if you are in a hurry.
4 I got a tip from a friend of mine who is from the east coast about this place. It didn't disappoint. We went on a Monday and even though they had the 2 for 1 lobstah salad rolls, I had a UConn roll and some steamahs. My wife had the New England Bake which is a 1 1/4 lb. lobstah, corn on the cob, and steamahs and the food was very good. I will say the food came out a little slow, but there were 6 of us and we were having a good time chatting, so it wasn't a huge deal. The waiter informed us that they only had one cook working, which is why it was a little slow. Over all I was satisfied and would recommend this place, especially to anyone missing all of the food from the east coast that is hard to find out here.
4 We have been to the Eastern Ave. location 2 times now and going again tonight.  I had the lobster dinner both times and it isn't the best I've had, but liked it a lot.  The tail itself wasn't anything to write home about, but the claw meat was delish!  They give you huge portions on your sides too.  My husband ordered the steak and he's picky about how it's cooked and said it was perfect each time.  We also are ordering and eating via Doc Holidays...their video poker is Not tight...we have walked out with more money than we spend each time!
1 I always wondered what poorly cooked lobster would tastes like if eaten if some dorm lounge.  Now i know.  Whoever owns this place, thinks hanging Red Sox pennants on the wall will fool people into thinking good New England style food is made here. Its not.  Never trust a restaurant hidden in another restaurant. Over priced for lackluster food with awkward table service.
5 The whole lobster was very good. Also had the chicken Parmesan and it was better than most Italian restaurants! This place was very good and the prices were reasonable. I will definitely eat here again! Service was very good as well.
4 Its As Good As It Gets Here In Vegas!.. This Place  Puts A Smile On my Face Everytime I Make A Visit. Im New To The Area And have Tried Alot Of Places Out Here In Las Vegas and wasn't always Completely Satisfied Until I Walked into "Monstah Lobstah". Its A Small Business, Sort Of hidden behind Everything But once You Walk In and Taste The Food, You will Never Forget its There. I Go once a week For The Same "Lobstah Salad Roll", Its Amazing Food. I Recommend it To Anyone Who Loves Seafood and in A Hurry.
1 The service was slow, and the macaroni and cheese that everyone raves about took nearly 45 minutes and wasn't worth the wait.  They don't serve alcohol in the dining area. You have to walk to the attached bar and get your own drinks.  It didn't have a good vibe, no music, no TVs, and everything was paper- plates, napkins, and even forks. I felt like I was at a child's birthday party with the tacky plastic table cloths.  We will not be returning to this restaurant.
5 We came here few months ago with our fambam and truly enjoyed our dinner. My in-laws who were from Hawaii thought the lobsters were really fresh & amazing! I enjoyed the UConn and the Lobster Escargot. My son & husband loved the Lobster Mac & Cheese and they're both not a big fan of Mac & Cheese. The prices are very good considering the food are great. Rick (our server) was incredible! He was very helpful in answering our questions. Overall customer service was great!  The only thing I didn't like is the smoky place being next to Doc Hollidays. The clam chowder does not have much of clams in it but the lobster bisque is very good. Overall, this place ROCKS!! We will definitely be coming back -- soon I hope!
