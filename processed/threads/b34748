5 Good service, easy to get a hold of, and good quality equipment. I got the 2gig system which was recommended for me, and it makes having a security system so convenient. I can ARM it accross the country, if I wanted to! Highly recommended!
5 I have been using knox security for the last 2 years and have had a peace of mind knowing that my home and family are protected. i always get the professional, friendly service I would expect from a security company. I highly recommend Jon and the crew at Knox security.
5 When my wife and I bought our new home we had a baby girl on the way, so great security, monitoring and cost was a huge priority. After doing our research and through recommendations we went through Jon Knox, owner of Knox Security Services Inc. We didn't want to go through ADT, their monitoring was too high and we had them in a prior house. ADT outsources their service reps and the quality of work was sub par. Our house almost caught fire because of an incorrect mini transformer installed by a former rep. When the out sourced rep came out he tried to sell us over priced window sensors under the table.  When Jon came to see our home he installed everything quickly and was easy to get in touch with when we had some questions. The quality of work, installation and equipment blew ADT out of the water. After getting to know him I could tell he does some very impressive work for very large homes and businesses. Even though I was a smaller job, he made me feel important and like I was his top priority. Not bad to get that sort of treatment from the owner of a company! Ever since we have had the alarm installed we haven't had a single issue and feel comfortable that our home and new family member are safe.   I highly recommend Knox Security Services Inc. for anyone considering a home security system and didn't want to go through ADT like my wife and I.
