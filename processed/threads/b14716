4 I was in desperate need for a haircut and stopped by this location on the way to work. Sarah did my hair and I've been getting compliments on my new style all day. I got a cut and style for $28! I love Arizona Hair Company because the stylists are experienced and the prices are reasonable. I won't get my hair done anywhere else.
5 It was a week before my wedding and I needed my hair colored and highlighted. I showed Sarah a few pictures and she knew exactly what she was doing! I couldn't be happier. I will never get my hair done by anyone else!
5 MaryLou at AZ Hair Co is very, very, very good!  Thank you for having such a talented stylist!
5 I just got back from AZ Hair Company. While I used to frequent the location in Chandler as a teenager, it was my first time at this particular location. Initially, I was really iffy, because I've heard that other locations were not nearly as good, but I really needed a haircut and I needed it at a reasonable price. I had my hair cut for about $20, including gratuity. I had my hair done by Christine and she was a total sweetheart. I'm more than happy with how my hair came out.
4 Good price, great hair.  I went to this location for several years before I moved to Surprise and Christine did an incredible job on my hair every time.  I even drove way out of my way to continue with her for almost a year after I moved.
5 I've been going to see Laura for a few years now and she's great! I've tried other stylist within this company and others (always mess my hair up). Go see Laura! She won't disappoint.
