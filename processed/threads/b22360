4 If you live on the South side of town, check them out. I go there to get all of my Thai ingredients, reasonably priced.
5 I can't even think of a Thai supermarket in LA, but in Vegas there's one down the street from me.  I love coming here, imagining I'm back in Thailand. The prices are reasonable, the selection surprisingly large & the store larger than it appears on the outside.  There's a small bakery inside & even a USPS (contracted) office attached to them.  Really convenient.
4 This place is great. I love Thai food but I've never actually cooked it before. Found this place online and decided to go in to check it out. The staff was really friendly and they had everything I needed. The prices seemed really reasonable too! You have to spend at least $12 to use the debit/credit machine.
3 When I need special ingredients to make thai or lao food, I'll occasionaly drop in. Bangkok market has pretty much everything your looking for to make thai food. lemongrass, basil, mint, galanga, curry, fermented fish sauce and fish sauce just to name a few lolz.  It's not big like the lao market up north or eastside but pretty convient. Just like most little asian market you could pick up phone cards, rent or buy thai dvds and movies and even buy prepackage food and desert. Staff is pretty nice and the location is great if your in the southwest area but parking is a pain haha cause of the location (Flamingo and Decature)
