5 Same Quality that most other panda express' have. Line moves quickly and always get free samples if you want to try something new. Parking lot is a little crowded depending on what time you go. But thats everywhere.
5 I've never been so happy to go to one place  all the time but every time I go the food is warm and not old . The restrooms are always clean and the staff is very friendly
3 Usually the food here is good, but today our orders of fried rice and teriyaki chicken all had that nasty burned taste. Unfortunate.
