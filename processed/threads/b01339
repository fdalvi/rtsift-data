5 The best place for a real manicure. And a fun place to spend part of your day.
1 This is a hair salon that does nails on the side. I think if nails were the main source of revenue they would be better at it and have a wide variety of name brand polishes to choose from.  The manicure was below average, I should have suspected as much when I saw the condition of my manicurist's nails & cuticles.  I will not be returning.
4 I recently started getting my hair done here. The shop is really small and can sometimes get a little crowded on the weekends. Heather does my hair, and she is great! She does a wonderful job with the color/highlights and is VERY quick and reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend her if you decide to visit this salon.
5 Very friends staff, Heather has done my hair for 4 years now!  She does a WONDERFUL job and is the sweetest girl, I highly recommend her. Very affordable.
