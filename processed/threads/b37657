5 These people are amazing. Really who else would want to stick people with needles the size of Mcdonalds straws? Fill saddle bags for Harley's with warm blood.... all day long.   The people from the front desk all the way to the needle poker are all great.   The place was clean adn the wait was short!
5 Great place to unload extra blood cells to be recycled into someone else!
