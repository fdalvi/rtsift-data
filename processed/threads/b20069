3 I originally gave this place 5 stars, but last time they sent out 2 people who didn't understand english to my table, but they were pretending as if they did understand me. I don't mind if their english is poor, but I'd prefer the honesty of their staff. My mango lasse was messed up because of the communication problem, even though I was told that they did understand what I wanted, as I had very specific questions about it. They also were late giving me my drink as it came after the main cource, and not even before or during the appetizer. Also, the samosas I got were black and crunchy in the middle, almost as if they were exposed to a freezer, then dry rotted, or the inside was burned somehow as the outside seemed fine. The second order of samosas came back o me frozen, so that's 2 times they messed that up. I do like the fact that their portions are decent, and the main courses were great, and I do remember really good experiences with this restaurant about a year prior to my bad experiences. I am giving them 3 stars because a long time ago they were great, but sems like they are going downhill a bit. I'm just being homest.
3 Food was ok although we were not feeling the decor.... a little dated and busy  :)
1 Was here last week with a pal, and it was rubbish.  Each dish was served with some very nasty looking "fresh" coriander leaves, and didn't provide much taste except hotness.   My naan was burnt, the rice was dry and tasteless, my friend's chipatti was just floury nonsense.   Don't bother coming here.
