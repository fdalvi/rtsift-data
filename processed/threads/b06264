2 Can definitely find a better pizza place but when you're hungry and desperate... it'll do... well until the next morning.
2 I have ordered from this pizza hut four separate times in the past year, and they have always given me good quality food and I have never had a problem, until now. I did an  online order for two large three topping pizzas, than added breadsticks and soda for an additional 5 bucks.  While there delivery was fast, the size of the pizza's I received was shocking. They gave me two mediums instead of larges, and when I called them to replace the mediums they said that they definitely gave me two larges.  I used to work at a pizza place and this is not a large. Well, I went and measured the pizzas while I was waiting for the larges and my measuring tape said 12". I went to pizza hut's website where it says that there mediums are in fact 12". Well, when they brought the new ones they were the exact same size. The delivery guy (who was very nice) told me that the manager said that this was their large, I told them this in fact was 12" when I measured it and he said that a 12" is a large....ugh...well, on the bright side they told me to keep the first two pizza's so we now have four mediums, so that's cool! lol.   Just be careful what you order from here, usually they are good, but this whole experienced kinda does not make me want to come back. Also, I am never that person who complains, I am actually an easy laid back person, but when I spend 30 bucks I expect more then just  mediums.
1 Waited 15 minutes longer than expected. Pizza, breadsticks, and chicken was cold had to reheat in my oven. While waiting for my order another customer returned three pizzas did not know why until I got home. I will not be ordering from here again.
