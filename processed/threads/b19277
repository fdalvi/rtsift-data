3 Okay so based on the smells and cleanliness I think I would give this place a 2 but because they have some unique stuff I'm giving it 3 stars.   This is an Asian store with a lot of unique items that you typically find in Asian/Chinese stores. They sell containers of blood, pig stomachs, incense, lotus bean or sesame seed fun buns. I just went in to browse due to curiosity.
4 No, it is not the best supermarket, but I'm giving it four stars anyway. If you are Chinese and miss home, this is a must-go. They have so many things that will ease the homesick feeling. The best part, besides the selection, is the prices.   Asian veggies are super cheap for a giant bag and you can get black sesame ice cream there. Asian snacks and Vitasoy are also here and they don't charge for plastic bags, which is handy.  I just wish it wasn't so far away, but it's not such a bad commute. I see students shopping in there all the time! Parking may be a bit of a hassle though - there's a parking lot right across but it's pretty damn sketch.
