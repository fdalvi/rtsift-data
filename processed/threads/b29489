5 03/23/12 REPAIR.  I had a GROUPON for a simple single rock repair. Took it over there, no appointment, they had me done in less than 30 minutes! Really nice repairman, people working the office, etc. If I ever have a need for more extensive body or glass repair, I'll go there!
5 There is a crack in my windshield!   So I needed to call my insurance company.  I have glass coverage so I wanted to see who they recommend.   Auto Glass Authority was the top of their list.    They were able to replace my windshield the next day.  Yay! Ken S. arrived in the time frame we set up.  He was very thorough and professional.  Within an hour my car was pretty again.    I would highly recommend using this company.  Everything went smoothly!
5 Great service! Tech Kris was very personable and knows his stuff! Explained the process and care very well! I highly recommend them!
