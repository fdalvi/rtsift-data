2 No clothes here yet, no need to go in!    just home and furniture, waste of what it could be!
3 I didn't find the staff over bearing, yes they obviously work on commission, but I didn't feel hounded. This store had really good selection.
4 its closing so they had great deals. just another place to lose your money in vegas...
3 Bloomingdales Home is closing for good so there are some deals to be had.  Right now they're at mostly 60% off, some 70% or 80%.   Lots of bedding, lots of plates and glass wear, lots of rugs, not too much kitchen appliance left, some beds and headboards, lots of Briggs and Britto luggage, womens fur coats, some chairs, accent chairs, dining tables but not a lot of furniture left. They are selling all their fixtures, display vases and decor as well.   It was always a odd thing to have a home store in a tourist mall....and one that closes before the mall closes so I can't say I'm not surprised.   I'll be checking it often for further mark downs, but I found a few gems like a few serving dishes, baking trays and considering some white plate sets from here since they still have plates in abundance.   Overall, good deals on things that would otherwise cost you way too much.
