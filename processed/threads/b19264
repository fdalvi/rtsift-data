5 Support independant mom n' pop chain!  Amazing selection, quality, prices, knowledgable friendly staff.  This is the only place in the tri-cities to buy new or used music.
4 Good music selection. Good prices They also have movies and posters. The vinyl selection is good.
5 I try to go to this store as sparingly as possible because there is no end of good music that I wish to purchase at any given time.  By Kitchener-Waterloo standards, this place is a treasure-trove of music. It's worth going for the used CDs alone, of which I strike gold every time I visit.  Their new music selection is a little taste of heaven, though it shows in their prices. I suppose I should thank them for having this limiting factor so I don't walk out to their store a thousand dollars poorer each time, which is pretty much what I always want to do.
