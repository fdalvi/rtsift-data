5 For the do-it-yourselfer, or (aspiring do-it-yourselfer, like me) this place is a gold-mine.  It's all about the staff and the crew at this store is eccellent.  They have talked me through may repairs and helped me get set with the right parts.  I find AutoZone parts to be reasonably priced and good quality.
4 I always end up fixing whatever part of my car happens to be busted - headlights, tail lights, brake lights, etc. etc. etc. - in one of the four parking spots in front of the store. (Usually with a guy friend in tow and my car manual in hand).   Super convenient. I only wish they had a self-checkout so things move a little quicker...
4 Consistently good service and prices. Check out can be abit slow if busy..Recently they made a mistake on a part they had to order,and gave a nice upgrade to an in store part with no prompting..Very pleased!
