5 Best place for eyebrow wax and eyelashes! I love that this salon is locally owned and operated. Yadira is who I go to and she is not only an excellent make-up artist, but her attention to detail when it comes to waxing my eyebrows, is hands down the best! They offer an extensive list of services from permanent make-up, make-up application to hair services. I've only had brow wax, eyelash application and make-up done here but I have friends and family that are regulars for their hair services & they always look fabulous! This place has great prices, awesome hours (they are always open), centrally located,  walk-ins are accepted however I recommend making an appointment because Yadira is in high demand.
5 I have been coming to see Yadira for the past few years for facials, waxing, permanent and regular makeup artistry. If Yadira isnt doing your eyebrows you are missing out! She is the only person I let touch my eyebrows. She is the most fabulous and in demand permanent makeup/regular makeup artist. She is a waxing pro and will make your eyebrows look perfect. My eyebrows were way overplucked and she fixed them and made them the way they should have always been. Her hairstroke permanent makeup technique is flawless and looks very natural. I also have permanent winged eyeliner which I love, and saves me so much time getting ready in the morning.  My eyelash extensions are on point and look amazing. I dont wear much eye makeup because, now I dont need it with my full and glamourous lashes. An appointment is recommended, but she will fit you in as a walk-in. Yadira is in high demand and usually very busy, especially on the weekends. She does beautiful bridal and quince makeup. I have her do my makeup for all my black tie and special events. Do yourself a favor and go see the awesome Yadira for the best work and best prices!
