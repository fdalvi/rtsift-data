2 Bathrooms are dingy, decent Jerky selection.   Water and Gas are super expensive - tank up before you cross the desert.  Lots of dirty kids in the parking lot.. what's up with that?
2 This is one expensive stop. The gas here is very expensive. Go fill up else where.
5 Friendly environment, Customer Service are great, The store was clean all the time. You can buy cheap item like chips and soda even cigarette are cheap compare it to other convenience store. They have Deli sandwiches which is awesome. They sell Mexican Food ( Tortas & quesadillas ) I would give the staff two thumbs up.. Keep it up
3 I didn't actually go in but it wasn't busy and we were in and out quickly getting gas.
5 Whether its late at night or early in the morning Short Line Express Market is my goto stop for gas and quick cool drinks.  The Staff is great and always in a great mood. I will continue to fill up my car and tummy at this location and suggest you do so as well.
