4 We stopped because there's a flying saucer on top...but the food shocked and delighted! Just breakfast, now.  My flying saucer pancakes (bigger than advertised) were very tasty and bacon/egg fine. Then tasted the BF's huevos con chorizo...holy smokes!  my taste buds went to outer space with joy (really: 5 stars). Refried beans so good I kept shovelling off his plate whilst apologizing.  What is IN there?? NM don't tell me.  Salsa INSANELY good. Perfect spiciness and robustness. In sum: order Mex, despite average store bought tortillas.    Can't vouch for the chicken fried steak, maybe next time we find ourselves on the 8!
4 I had the chicken fried steak it was super good. The 3 of us ate there for a very reasonable price. The waitress spilled 1 of the plates but comped on it anyway and we still got the food. super place to eat would stop there again.
4 I met with friends at the SpaceAge restaurant and was very pleased with the atmosphere and friendliness. As for the food we all (4 of us) had something different and all were pleased. I had the Chimiganga ( shredded beef) and it was one of the best I have ever had. We will go back.
