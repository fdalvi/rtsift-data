3 I had to drop off a return back to Amazon.  Good thing I found an UPS drop off pretty close by.  They had a few people in there (1 at the counter, 2 roaming the store, and another person at the counter).  The employee at the other counter greeted me and told me to come over so she can help me.  Turns out that the other person is waiting for tape.  The employee took my package and scanned it in.  She was not too friendly but at least she didn't make me wait.  I got my receipt and off I went.
1 They packed my item that I shipped to someone and I put a hefty insurance on te item and it was damaged during shipping and they will not honor the insurance because the item was packed incorrectly. Also service was poor I had to wait for 10 minutes and there was no one in line just kinda scattered around the store.
1 The management is overwhelmingly rude and the price they charge for fax is outrageous. Making a profit is one thing taking advantage of someone is another.
