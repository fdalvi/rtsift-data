5 This is the best pizza place! The crust is absolutely delicious and the sauce is amazing. I highly recommend.
4 Awesome hot n fresh pizza. We ate our large pepperoni pizza in and ordered extra very flavorful marinara sauce. But the bread with cheese was $4 for only 4 small pieces
5 Clean place with delicious food!!! It's amazing I can enjoy a real Chicago style Vienna Beef hot dog here in AZ and that it tastes better here than in IL! My husband is originally from IL and one of his early high school jobs was working for a hot dog place. The dogs were just the way we like them fresh with the freshest buns and ingredients! Also had the Italian Beef sandwich with giardiniera and a side of garlic bread. Don't miss this gem on the west side!
4 Great Pizza and a local business.
