5 I've used King Plumbing, Heating and AC twice now. Once for an AC issue and once for a plumbing problem. Both experiences have been wonderful! They arrived on time and figured out the problem quickly and completed in it in the same day. I felt very confident in their work and will definitely use them in the future.
5 Terry and Brandon came out to address a problem today that was left by a previous company (they refused to come back out). They were completely professional, kind and took our concerns very seriously. King fixed the problem and made sure we were satisfied, telling us they would come back out if we had any further concerns. I look forward to using them again.
5 I used Terry from King Plumbing, Heating and AC about 6 months after we bought our house. We needed service done on our heater, AC unit, and garbage disposal. Terry went right to work, got everything done in a few hours, including installing a programmable thermostat. He helped us get full use out of our home warranty plan and cleaned up after everything was done. Highly Recommended!
5 Lane from Kings Plumbing was so great to work with.  He was knowledgeable and very easy to get along with. He gave me straight answers and some helpful tips on preventative maintenance. Awesome guy and hard worker. Thanks KIngs Plumbing!
