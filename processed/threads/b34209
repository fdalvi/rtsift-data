5 Fun, Clean, and Free  Great facilities. Our church uses this once a year for annual sporting fellowship get together.  Has basketball, softball, and sand volleyball pits.  Clean.  They do have restrooms and water fountains.  Dog park next door.
5 Great park. 2 different sized playgrounds. Swings for babies and older Holstein. Ramadas with picnic tables. Also there is a nice paved circle shaped path for bike riders. Oops can't forget the tennis and basketball court!
5 This is an impressive park. The community building offers a variety of activity. There are good playground and picnic areas. It is set up well for several sports. There is a dog park sometimes available but it is nice for walking a leashed dog too. Plenty of parking.
4 Super clean and friendly park. Activities are always going on and the place is very well lot. I felt safe walking around this place by myself after dark.
