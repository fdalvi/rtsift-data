4 I don't care what any of you say.  I like this crappy fake Japanese take out.  I've liked it since I was a teenager and nobody can convince me otherwise.   :-p
5 Hibachi is normally related to Japanese name. however, I notice all the Asian worker speak Northern CHINESE.   The place is very  clean - as expected - it is a new.  the food: good selection, good salad bar, very reasonable price, fresh. it taste approximately equal to other Asian buffet. All good.
5 Uh.. oh...I error. the review is for the hibachi grill buffet, at 10030 n. metro parkway. my bad.
3 Good for fast food. Very similar to Panda Express with food choices and taste. Overall okay. Their potstickers are amazing though.
