1 Of all the businesses I was hoping the recession would put out of business, TicketMaster headed the list. I don't think I have ever felt passion in my life, but if I did it would be hating this company with a passion. The ticket prices are okay; I can live with that. What I hate are the fees. In looking to purchase tickets to an upcoming event, there is another $19.95 per ticket added to the price. Ordering 2 tickets, that's another $40 - the price of another ticket to a different event. The challenge is that while not technically a monopoly, they are close. There are options such as resellers StubHub, EBay and a local favorite of mine, Life & Leisure, but as far as ordering direct, often that isn't a possibility unless it is ordered through TicketMaster or direct from the box office. In the end it would cost as much in gas to drive from here to Jobbing.com or UOP Stadium as it would to pay their fees. A few years ago Pearl Jam tried to take them to court and look what happened to them - lost in an abyss of no-longer-relevants. Talk about stiff arm...
1 How could this company have a stranglehold on the entire concert industry when their website doesn't process purchases?  We spent 5 days trying to buy Cheap Trick tickets- 8 attempts on two different computers. Sometimes Ticketmaster's site would only let us pick the seats, other times it let us get as far as credit card info, but each time it would say, "We're processing your order. Don't click away from this page," and then the little icon would spin and nothing happened. One time we let it spin for 30 minutes.  So I called, thinking I'd get a person to buy tickets from and tell that the website wasn't processing orders. No. They have an automated system that wants to know where you live and your phone number and who you think you are trying to buy tickets from them. Seriously, it was 10 minutes to buy tickets that we are picking up ourselves, not having mailed. The system didn't recognize my voice so I had to repeat things 2 and 3 times. Maybe because at this point I was screaming my answers.  Then, it has the nerve to ask me if I'd like to take a survey about the service of their system. Hell yes I do! I was asked to rate the service from 1 (bad) to 6 (great). Only the system doesn't recognize the word "one". After asking me the same question several times and getting "one" as the answer, it told me that I couldn't finish the survey due to technical difficulties. So I'll tell them here: Ticketmaster, you get a one.
