4 Supercut stereotypes aside, I got a really good cut here at this location from the stylist... Paula I think was her name.  Great value for the price, so of course make up for it with a heartwarming gratuity.  Plenty of parking, nice shopping area too.
4 Courtney did a great job. Very clean establishment. Easy to get an appointment without the long wait.
5 I am very meticulous about my hair. Supercuts was the best I have had in years. Highly recommended!
