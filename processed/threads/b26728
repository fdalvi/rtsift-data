5 They staff was absolutly amazing! They were extremely patient with me when I couldn't pee right away and when I admitted that I was an ex-junkie and my veins would be hard to find, they were super nice and didn't treat me and differently.  My over all experience was wonderful, couldn't have possibly been any better.
1 Very disappointed.  I made an appointment just to have a routine blood work done.  The white lady behind the desk had no idea what she was doing.  She was calling people twice that was not needed.  The African American lady who was taking the blood told that lady to number who's appointment is first.  The appointment after me was going to be taken before me.  I had to wait 45 minutes with an appointment, The blood work was done very quickly as it was only one tube. The lady at the front desk was asking for my credit card to pay my co pay.  I told her that I don't have one.  She wanted my card anyway.  I didn't feel comfortable doing that.  She called me back up to the front and she said yes you don't have a co pay. Dah.  Well exactly one month after my blood being drawn they went and took some money out of my account with no approval.  It is the amount that the insurance didn't pay.  They should have billed me NOT automatically take it out of my account. What if there was not enough funds? I was pretty pissed.  I tried calling them yesterday and today but you are on hold forever and ever. It is so stupid.  If you decide to go don't give them your credit card just say you will pay with cash.  Don't want you to go through what I am going through with them now.
