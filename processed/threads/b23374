5 I used LTD this past summer since a friend hosted a party at their party location 5C, off of Mill. This location is perfect for any type of event, especially at sunset. The owners and employees were more than helpful and made my event stress free. The equipment was in top condition and the snow cone machine was spotless. I couldn't be happier because of LTD's help I had little stress to be well prepared for hosting a great event. Thank you!
5 I attended a private party at LTD's Studio 5c venue and it was fantastic!  The rooftop venue is across from Sun Devil Stadium and has great views.  This would be the perfect place to host a pre-game party during football season.  Studio 5c is large enough to host a party of 75 people and the company's rentals come at a discounted price.  The venue is a hidden gem in Tempe that would impress guests for any party.   I highly recommend hosting a party at Studio 5c or using LTD for party rentals.
5 Excellent customer service and outstanding prices.  They provided me tables, chairs and heaters for my backyard party and everything was delivered on time, making my event a huge success!
