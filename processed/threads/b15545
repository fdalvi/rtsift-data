3 Easy to get to location...just like every other 7 Eleven, it has everything from drinks to snacks to alcohol. Stopped for gas and an energy drink...no hassle, quick in and out...no complaints!
3 this place can save your life if you've been partying too hard. have a slushy and relax.  it's only 4am.  Gas, Coffee, red bull, water, beer, smokes and hotdogs... well lit , clean and restrooms.
5 It's the cleanest 7-Eleven I've been to hands down. The employees were friendly, and there are not any homeless people standing around by the door. (It Might not be important to you, but at other stores it seems as if they encourage them to ask for money).  Overall great store, great selection, friendly staff!
