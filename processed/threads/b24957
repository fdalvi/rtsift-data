4 Chiropractor's office attached to the Gold's Gym at 83rd and Thunderbird. We went here after a subpar experience somewhere else, and were definitely impressed. Dr Stamp works m/w/f and always has a few minutes to chat or offer advice between seeing patients or while doing paperwork. He was the first chiro I've been to who actually asked me where I hurt THEN did adjustments specifically to fix that. I had ribs out of whack and a few other things and he put them all back. And he was comfortable working on my above-average sized husband, which some chiropractors aren't. I would have liked to be shown more stretches and such to do so I won't be back as often. They are great at working with your insurance and finances- they have a deal where for $199 you can go as many times as you want in a month. You do have to sign up for 2 months back to back, but it is still a good deal. Only downfall here is that their cash rate is higher if you don't have insurance. It is $50 cash for an adjustment, but only $35 if you have insurance. That's true whether or not you even opt to have them bill your insurance. I think they take walk-ins, but if nothing else we have been able to call and get same-day appointments pretty consistently.
5 I went to Chirofit after a car accident, and it was the best thing that I could have done. Dr. Stamp was awesome and really got my body back into shape... please forgive the pun. The office staff is very nice and is really on top of things. I'd definitely recommend the Peoria, AZ location!  The ONLY thing I was a little worried about (and not enough to take a star away) was that they are attached to a Gold's Gym. Never ONCE was I approached or pressured to join the gym.
5 I have been going to ChiroFit inside Gold's Gym since 2007 when I was the gym's General Manager. Dr. Stamp is awesome, very knowledgeable, personable, and always fixes the issue!  I recommend this office for chiropractic and sports injury recovery
