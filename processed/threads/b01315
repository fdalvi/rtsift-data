1 I grabbed a burger/tots from this location on 12/2/11 (I typically don't eat "fast food" but I was in a bind.)  About 3am the following morning I was sick, I have spend the last 10 hours or so throwing up and cementing my ban on fast food.  Customer beware, nothing feel worse than food poisoning. This is not just upset stomach, it is full on horrible.
4 The staff is always super friendly and fast.
1 The ONION RINGS we were served were SOUR!!! The MANAGER who took my order "managed" to Screw up my order. Then the carhop brought my change back covered in spit. Every time we go to this location they add something to our order! TERRIBLE LOCATION that should be SHUT DOWN.
