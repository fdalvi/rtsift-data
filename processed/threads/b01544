5 We Love DDPS!!! Great teachers and owners, supportive parents, impressive creative projects, and fun events for the kiddos (especially pizza day, bubbles the clown, and zoo day)! My mini me is prepared for kindergarten and is a balanced child thanks to the love, care, mentorship, and creativity from Desert Dawn! We have been here for over two years and wish we started sooner.
5 I have sent three kids to Desert Dawn and it is truly a special place! Caring teachers who have been there forever, great curriculum and fun activities. Plus I Iove the garden, goats and chickens!
