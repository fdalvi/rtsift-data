5 From my personal experiences here, I would recommend the service at Benny's to anyone.  I called around to a couple of Auto shops in Tempe to get a quote on a transmission change and an oil change.  Most places, besides Richard from Benny's Auto Repair and Chris from Mile Auto Repair, were negative sounding over the telephone.  However, Richard from Benny's Auto Repair and Chris from Mile Auto Repair, were friendly and went out of their way to check on the required fluids for my desired services and gave me a price quote.  I ended up going with Benny's because the quote was $20 cheaper than Mile Auto Repair...which isn't too much of a difference.  Especially since one Auto shop in town gave me a total quote of $252!  Anyway, Benny's got me in the next day and showed excellent customer service throughout my whole interaction with them.  I received a transmission change and an oil change for exactly $100.85.  That is a great deal!  Check out Benny's if you can!  I will be taking my business in the future to them!
5 I walked into Benny's needing some significant work done to the brakes.  I was broke and in need of a break.  Benny and his family didn't know me at all.  They cut me the break of a lifetime and helped me out BIG TIME.  I have been there several times over the past 3 years and have pointed my friends in their direction.  I trust them more than any mechanic...and most people, I've ever known.  Their prices are cheap and they're good people.
5 Honest family shop that always does right by his customers. I have sent numerous friends to his shop and have never heard a bad word.
