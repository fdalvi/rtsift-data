4 I'm not a total fan of Subway , but good enough if you need something quick. Only eaten here once and considering it was lunch time, wasn't busy.  This Subway is actually hidden in a Big Lots and Target shopping center.   Gave this place 4 stars just for service alone.  Had a 6 in wheat with quadruple chicken breast. Basically it's 2 foot long chicken breast, but in only 6 inches of bread.  This is what I usually get a Subway.  High protein, lower carbs.  I've confused these sandwich artists with these orders in the past so I usually tell them a foot long, double meat, but put everything on one side.  After it was oven roasted, my sandwich artist checked the meat and noticed that some pieces were still cold. She re-cooked just the chicken and I didn't even request it. She knew what I was striving for and made it happen. She's great and built my sandwich with a smile.  I will be back for sure.  Hopefully, I'm lucky and get the same sandwich artist.  Believe me, some have messed this order up before.  Add ranch to the side to dip and it's perfect.
5 This is a great subway.  Yes it's a little hidden in the Target and Big Lots parking lot, but the service is wonderful, the food is great and all around fantastic.  Very often not horribly busy when I go there (then again i usually am not in during the busy time anyway).  I would definitely recommend going to this subway.
2 Sandwich is dry... I will stick to Jimmy Johns... Got fooled by the $4 lunch special...
1 Stale bread, no napkins, no coke and sandwich artist had no clue what was going on. #subwayfail
1 Was Here Memorial Day Weekend. What a Mess. Staff needs to go. If you don't want to work at subway, then don't work at subway. Everything was done with an attitude. Everything being thrown around or harshly. Worst subway I have ever been to.
