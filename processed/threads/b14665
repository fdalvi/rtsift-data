4 Just visiting Arizona for a couple of days and I found this amazing smoke shop it had no reviews so hey why not make one for them. the water pipes prizes are really good  and they have different types. It's a must go check it out.    As for hookahs its ok. And they have the same shisha as every else but a lot of selection and really low prices.  That's not all they even offer a points system u get points for shopping there and then you can get free stuff very very nice.
5 Ok so right away, this place is stocked and organized. I can't believe it. This shop is the owners pride and joy and it reflects in his shop and customer service.  His personality alone is a reason to come visit this shop. If you need help in deciding what to do this is the place to go.  E-cigs: the new tobacco industry without all the bad shit. He has a flavor station set up to try. Have a question about the product? Put away your smart phone, no need to google. He'll tell you all you need to know.  Hookahs need hard to find parts? They'll get them for you.
5 Great prices, friendly staff, outstanding selection and quality glass, up there with if not surpasses skyhigh and its all goodz.
