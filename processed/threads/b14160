4 5 stars for food, minus 1 star for lack of ambience and service.  Take-out highly recommended.  I can't believe this place hasn't been reviewed yet.  It must be the best kept secret because to me this is the real deal.  You come here just for the food - there's zero ambience - it's inside, literally, a shack.  I'd recommend take-out but if you want to feel like you're eating at a roadside taco stand in Mexico, grab a seat at the counter by the blaring tv playing Mexican soaps.  This is a family affair - either the father or the mother usually mans it.  Some nights the whole family will be hanging out there waiting for the place to close at 9pm.  The owner told me they used to operate in California.    He's very proud of the fact that all the meats are cooked onsite from family recipes unlike most others which buy the meat preseasoned and cooked at Ranch Market.  This really shows - their meat is tender and bursting with flavor.  The pastor is a perfect balance of lean and fat pork resulting in a juicy tender filling for tacos.  Portions are also generous especially given the low prices, eg. the tasty cabeza (cow's head) was barely contained by the two soft tacos ($1.35).  I hope I didn't just spoil someone's secret.
5 Tasty authentic Mexican tacos!  The best tacos were the al pastor and the most expensive one.
1 My experience was not so great.  I ordered a Carne Asada burrito to go, and it was bad. Smelled like old (rancid) grease from a grill that hadn't been cleaned in years.  Threw half away.  Minor bathroom problems the next day.  I think I will skip this one next time. Need to do some serious cleaning.
