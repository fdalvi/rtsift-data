4 It seems a little strange to review a pawn shop on Yelp but here you go.  Vegas Pawn is on the Tempe/Scottsdale border right next door to Skin Cabaret. It's aptly named. Between the limos outside Skin and Vegas Pawn's sign it does look a little like Vegas.  I went to Vegas Pawn for on other reason besides the fact that I had never visited a pawn shop before. And it was an interesting experience.  How do you judge one pawn shop from another? Inventory? Customer service? Good deals?  My first impression was security. These guys are serious! You have to be allowed to enter. The front door opens to a steel cage which the desk clerk has to buzz open before you enter the rest of the store.  And this is understandable after seeing their inventory. This is a high-end pawn shop with a large selection of jewelry, watches (Rolex, Cartier), loose diamonds, gold, and more. They also buy and sell boats, ATVs, motorcycles...etc.  I had no idea pawn shops kept that type of inventory.   Everyone I met there was helpful and friendly. I don't necessarily see myself pawning anything in the near future but I'd go back to Vegas Pawn if I needed.
4 This is an awesome place to find good quality items for sale.  It's a bit small and crammed full of stuff, but it's quality merchandise.  They have watches, jewelry, TV's, bikes, musical instruments, and artwork available to purchase.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vegas-pawn-and-jewelery-scottsdale?select=qNyewfWtcm_J4LK6RWC0tw#qNyewfWtcm_J4LK6RWC0tw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vegas-pawn-and-jewelery-scottsdale?select=TBwzebFlK3WuVkxAKo0uew#TBwzebFlK3WuVkxAKo0uew http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vegas-pawn-and-jewelery-scottsdale?select=3062bmGixLluQiYO97kOPw#3062bmGixLluQiYO97kOPw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vegas-pawn-and-jewelery-scottsdale?select=na--CtC3wpcG8decrpfoWQ#na--CtC3wpcG8decrpfoWQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vegas-pawn-and-jewelery-scottsdale?select=Jv9_bV5rDfvkS1JpJDC6jw#Jv9_bV5rDfvkS1JpJDC6jw  There are 3 different rooms of items.  You have to be buzzed in to the other 2 rooms because the feature pricey pieces of jewelry.  The employees here are really nice and friendly.  They don't fret when you ask them to open cases to look at items, they gladly oblige.  Return Factor - 91%
5 I've never been to a pawn shop before (I'd heard bad things) but these guys were offering a Dyson vacuum that I was looking for, so I thought I'd go check it out.  They are serious about their business (see others comments re: security), but super cool to work with and IMMACULATE showroom.  Definitely saw some things I might go back for!
5 This is a nice clean pawn shop. They have all types of jewelry that is in a good price range. The store is kept very nice and clean. The staff that works here are helpful and pleasant.
