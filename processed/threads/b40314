3 Yay, smoking lounge! But be warned, it's damn expensive (then again, you're in LAS so they price everything like you won big at one of the numerous slot machines scattered throughout the airport). One beer-- A STELLA AT THAT--set me back about $11 (specifically, it was $11.45 but then there's tipping and I tipped nicely despite the price). There's a special that allows you to get a $4 shot with your beer... I guess if you're willing to drop $15+, cool?   The atomosphere ranges from business men lookin' for booze to tatted youths looking to smoke and booze up as well. Annnnd it is quite clean! Plus, the bartender that was working was pretty sassy, so I did enjoy that.   All in all, it's a convenient smoking lounge with pretty steep prices, but again, it is LAS so it's not surprising.
3 McCarran had eliminated smoking some time ago and now they brought it back in full force. this bar is connected to the gaming area, which is also smoker friendly. several high tops and a booths lining the walls. bartenders were pretty friendly. drink prices were standard. i gave them 1 extra star because they have plugs under the booth seats. but, you have to inhale half a pack and smell like your uncle's coat to charge it even 10percent.   i'm knocking this place because people should really quit smoking. but, i'm not going to knock the star off because it serves its' purpose for those people that need it. including mama. i'm an ex-smoker so i know what i'm talking about. but, i digress and step off the soap box.
