5 Jim Simmons was a life saver for my music academy, Ensemble Arts Academy, in Las Vegas. He was very detailed in the specifications for my print job, he got the printing done a day ahead of schedule, it was higher quality than several other printers in Las Vegas, and he accomplished our print job with our needs in mind. I would highly recommend you try Spectrum Color Printing for your printing needs.
5 Jim is a real professional and has mastered the art of printing and providing stellar customer service. He provides on-time quality service and products to provide your business the utmost in excellence. You need to review his website, call him, and meet with him to realize that he offers the best and delivers the best. I have heard nothing but wonderful things about Spectrum and having worked with Jim I an attest to his professionalism and hard work to make sure his customers are happy and walk away with stellar products for their business, event, and or fundraiser.
5 Great service! Efficient and very fast! Also affordable. We changed the size of the banner but he didn't charge us.  We used their services for printing a banner for our tv show and it came our exactly how we wanted it.  And they understood our changes when we needed them. Would highly recommend!!!
5 Jim Simmons at Spectrum was so helpful, accommodating, speedy, and super user friendly when I ordered our Flier Box - Company Logo - Dye-cut Stickers.  They turned out awesome as he knew exactly what I wanted and he personally delivered them to me because he knew how much I needed them the next day for our office meeting.  Thanks Jim!
5 Amazing service!!  We needed a banner at the last moment and Spectrum Color Printing & Mailing was able to get it done for us within 24hrs!  Fast!  Friendly!! Efficient!!
