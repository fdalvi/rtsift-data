4 This location is a combo Toys R us/Babies R Us. The left-hand side of the store is the Babies R Us. This opened I believe early in the spring of 2012. We registered here for our baby shower but found it was lacking a bit in selection, so we were able to finish up at the larger Mayo Blvd location. This babies R us doesn't have the little gift wrap section where you can choose their complimentary wrap by the way. Toys R us side is great..nice selection, neat and tidy.   For the moms, there is a changing table in the womens rest room, as well as a nice mothers nursing room with a sofa and changing table, stocked with wipes and disposable covers. Hooray!
5 Looking for pak and play for a baby shower I was going to.  Staff was helpful and I found what I needed.
5 Have done Black Friday shopping here the last two years, both great experiences although last year staff was more knowledgable the this year :) store was clean and organized and has brought me back for all my toy needs :)
1 Terrible service. Clueless at the baby registry counter and rude manager, Mike that smokes cigarets out front of the store.  Wish I could give them 0 stars. Pretty sure they ordered the wrong chair and then lied to me and never put it on my registry like I asked. I'm going to another location to try and figure out the mess this dumb place got me into.. Too much stress for being 7 months pregnant. :(
