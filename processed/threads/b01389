5 Dr. Guarino is awesome!  He's knowledgable, friendly (very likeable), respectful and gave one of the best and easiest adjustments I have ever had. I felt better instantly. I am very particular and a bit fearful of chiropractors but Dr. Guarino is fantastic.  His office staff is great too...very friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend Backpro!!!
5 Dr. Guarino has been working on my back for several  months and it's been great.  I have a herniated disc and have had back problems for years.  He's done a great job stretching me and treating my back.  He takes the time to talk with me and I  like the fact that I feel we are friends and he cares about my well being.  He knows my history and helps give me ideas about my workouts.  Great staff and great service.
5 I just wanted to take this opportunity to highly recommend Dr. Richard Guarino and BackPro Chiropractic & Nutrition, Inc.  Dr. Guarino genuinely cares about exceeding each patient's expectations.    There is not enough positive feedback that I can provide regarding Dr. Richard Guarino and BackPro Chiropractic & Nutrition, Inc.
5 Working with Dr. Guarino has completely turned my life around.  I came in after having been to the ER and several specialists over several years who could not determine the source of my pain and Dr. Guarino was able to pinpoint the issue and create a treatment plan in just one visit.  After three months of three day a week appointments I am no longer in daily pain and truly feel as though I have my life back!  Everything about my experience at BackPro Chiropractic has been wonderful.  The office is lovely and incredibly accommodating.  I have been so impressed by Dr. Guarino's depth of knowledge and true desire to help people. I can not recommend BackPro enough!!
