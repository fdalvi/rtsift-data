5 This Chiropractic office is the best that Henderson, NV has to offer.  Dr. Ormand is a great Chiropractor!
5 Dr. John Ormond and his staff are amazing.  The center is beautiful and clean you really feel relaxed there.  I'll drive all the way from the other side of town because service is so great.
5 Fourteen years ago, when I lived in Southern California, I slipped in the tub and hurt my back BAD! It took me over a year meeting with a Chiropractor 10 times per week before I was really able to walk again, and almost 18 months of intensive Chiropractic work before I was able to live a life without constant pain.   Six years later, and living in Las Vegas, the pain came back. A combination of my weight and sitting in front of a computer for 15 hours a day had taken its toll, and I was back to walking with a cane because the pain was so intense. That's when I met Dr. John, and I am grateful that I did. Within 3 months of therapy, I regained my full range of motion, and within 9 months, I was completely pain free. Dr. John knows his business and can absolutely help you feel better.   In addition to the physical remedy he provides, a visit to his clinic is sure to life your spirits. Dr. John is energetic, fun, and incredibly motivational. His "can do" attitude is contagious, and I've never left a meeting with him without feeling like I can tackle the world. In the 6 years I've known him, Dr John has become much more than a doctor, and I am proud to be able to call him my friend.   Whether you are considering Chiropractic because of an injury, or because you are looking to feel better, Dr. John is one of a kind. Do yourself a favor and give him a call
5 LIFE SAVER! - Normally what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but this one I will leak out to you.  Went with the wife to enjoy a week of uninterrupted fun and relaxation.  Ended up lifting a bag wrong when I took it out of the car.  I think I twisted something that wasnt meant to be twisted.  By the second day my neck would barely turn, and the pain was prohibiting any activity.  Went to see Dr. Ormand without an appointment.  After the paperwork was done, I went in, he examined me, did something (I'm thinking it was some kind of magic/mystical secret) to my neck and back, and then had me iced down.  I walked out of there a new man!  Cant thank Doc Ormand and his staff enough.  If I lived closer, I would see him regularly.
