2 This was my second time going to the culinary school's grab and go section...both times ordering an Egg Salad Sandwich, bag of chips and soda for only $3.50.  My first experience was GREAT and I was so excited to be able to get an Egg Salad sandwich anytime I wanted.....However, today's experience was not as grand.  What I was hoping to be an EGGcellent sammie, unfortunately tastes like TUNA!  I'm wondering if  someone forgot to rinse out the bowl in between making Tuna Salad and Egg Salad....or if the Egg Salad sandwich I had was cut with the Tuna Salad knife.   Either way.....it unfortunate.  I am very disappointed and am bummed.  :-(
4 I decided to venture outside of the office kitchen and explore the mysterious Cafe in the Culinary Institute that I had heard so much about. Though their selection is small and often random, the food was delicious. I chose the hot dog ( not very adventurous, I know), but paired it with a delicious potato salad and piece of foccacia. The Foccacia definitely stole the show. So much so that my friend who joined me went up for two more pieces. I would go just to get the bread for delicious sandwich fixings. A cheap and quick alternative to the sometimes time consuming and expensive Cafe Conmigo.   I have also heard rumors that they have a tasty breakfast burrito. Yum!
4 I have experienced dining here a few times. Every time a winner. I have had pork tenderloin, bouillabaisse, and a roasted chicken. No complaints.
