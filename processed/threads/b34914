5 I have been coming to see Dr Albrecht and Holly the hygienist for over 15 years and I have received exceptional care and service every time! These folks REALLY care. Dr Albrecht is always on the cutting edge of restorative and cosmetic dentistry and somehow always remembers the details of your past conversations. I don't know if she keeps a journal or has a photographic memory but either way it's pretty awesome.  If you are looking for a dentist.... this is the place to go.
5 Excellent caring staff, great work, and fair fees. Dr. Stavoe is personable and professional and the hygienist Joanne is the best. Kirsten in the front office is fantastic to work finances with. The overall feeling in this office is light and happy -  I've finally found a dental office I am very happy with.
5 I think this office has the atmosphere and people what everyone is hoping for in a dentist's or any medical office... now they just need to move further east! ;)  The staff is very kind and welcoming, and the entire office is very clean and professional. As a person with a variety of dental issues, the concept of "preventative dentistry" is very welcoming. With all the measuring and note taking they do during my visits it makes me feel good that they're keeping an eye on things.  Also, there have been a few situations where they have noted something but said, "Might be a filling, but we'll watch it... no need for concern now." That's pretty refreshing when I know some people are concerned about being taken advantage of or sold unnecessary dental work.  Lastly, I have very sensitive teeth.  During a cleaning the hygienist saw me kind of squirming when she got near my gums. They made a note of it and now always apply a cream to my gums to take the sensitivity away and clean by hand instead of using the ultrasonic equipment!   I would have never known that was an option!  Bottom line: they care.
