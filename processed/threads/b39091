5 If you're looking for a place to get service done on a Ducati, this is the place. Took the bike in this morning and they had it back to me in less than three hours.  While doing the standard 600 mile service, Irish Mike noticed a strange vibration and took the exhaust apart to find a loose washer.  Even with the extra work, the bill was LESS than what they quoted.    Overall, the staff was friendly and the service was great.
5 I have a Ducati 1098 with almost 40,000 miles on it. The only reason it has gotten that far is because of Irish Mike. And the only place you can find Irish at is LV motorcycle rentals and repairs.
5 Irish Mike is the only person I will let work on my bikes.  After months of searching for someone who knew what they were doing in this town, I was recommended here.  Mike is totally honest, communicative, helpful, knows just about EVERYTHING about motorcycles, and he does what he says he's going to do.  Good motorcycle shops are hard to find and I highly HIGHLY recommend Irish Mike.   Do yourself a favor...
