5 Excellent Mexican Food, service and atmosphere! Try their Breakfast...the BEST we have had in all of Glendale!
4 I like the place so far, the breakfast burritos are awesome.  I had also ordered the pollo fundido but that is just okay.  The chips and salsa are fantastic and the service is always good.  I like the casual atmosphere, you can tell it was a fast food place because they have a drive thru but I think that is only for pick up now.  I would have to say it is the nicest casual Mexican place I have been too.
4 I just happened upon this place one day and I have to say the food is really good.  I am always on the hunt for good Mexican food, which is very hard to come by in Phoenix.  My first visit I had the pozole.  It was so good!  The service was friendly and the place looked new and clean!  I am a fan!
5 Pleasantly surprised!  Nice atmosphere, great service, and very tasty food!
5 I was really skeptical coming to this restaurant because there were only 5 reviews.   The interior seating reminds me of some of the local restaurants in Mexico. Brings back joyful memories and a sense of comfort.   The host was friendly and welcoming. Our waitress was very nice and helpful with the menu.   I ordered the chicken mole which was tasted fresh and delicious! My wife had a mini-chimichanga with shredded chicken. She also enjoyed the food. My 5-year old son ate his rice and beans. He doesn't normally eat well at restaurants if he doesn't like the food. He loved it!  They also have a full bar with 2 flat screens hanging at both ends.  The service and food here is excellent and I am definitely coming here more often.   5 stars!
4 We were just out and about, stopped in. My expectations were drop kicked to the curb. This place was awesome. I really enjoyed the food. The beans seemed home made like my momma's.  The service was awesome. It was very clean and really enjoyable. I will be back to combat my hangovers with some good ceviche.
5 Great food! Friendly service! Attractive restaurant!  Anaya's Fresh Mexican food is how they bill themselves. Fresh for sure!  I loved my dish. It was arroz con pollo (chicken with rice). An attractive plate that included lightly sauteed zucchini, mushrooms and peppers in a spicy sauce. A generous dish so I had leftovers--a lot of food for the price. Lunch buddy enjoyed the same dish except with prawns (shrimp).  Anaya's has an extensive menu, the usual Mexican fare but lots of different dishes and many that included seafood. They open early and even have a drive thru where you can get takeouts, like breakfast burritos or lunch or dinner. How convenient!  The Mexican furnishings and decor are authentic and outstanding--a cheerful atmosphere. Our server had a great attitude, friendly and helpful.   Anaya's is a new family-owned restaurant in Glendale. I hope it does well because it has a lot to offer. Looking forward to another visit and trying some other dishes.
5 Tried it today for the first time. The food was very good and reasonably priced. My only "complaint" is the server never asked if we needed  refills on our drinks, which we did. The spicy, but very awesome salsa was the culprit. I will be back, I'm sure.
5 Excellent food, extensive menu, a+++
4 A place that probably won't last, which is too bad. There's nothing bad to say about the restaurant, service, or food. Unfortunately there isn't anything good to say about the food either. The food is fine, it's just not worth going back for. Gave 4 stars because its clean & servers are nice.
3 I used to go to this place before it burned down so I figured I would give it a shot since it was completely rebuilt.  I was disappointed to find out it was a totally new owner, name, recipes and menu.  They did an outstanding job of renovating the place.  I came in for lunch one day and ordered the fajitas.  The food was just okay.  Your typical run of the mill mexican restaurant.  I was disappointed with the portions as they were rather small.  For the amount of money I spent I feel that the portions were skimpy and therefore I havent been back.
4 I have been wanting to try Anayas for a while now but my husband was skeptical. He either wants Macayo's for sit down or Filiberto's for drive thru. Anaya's is a little bit of both.    Stopped in on a Friday night around 6:30 to find it empty except 1 table with 3 diners. That was a red flag but we were greeted promptly and the restaurant was exceptionally clean, even the restrooms were spotless. We were seated quickly and immediately were given chips and salsa, and without asking they brought out basically tomato sauce for my 5 year old son. He was ecstatic, he had his own salsa and it made him feel special.  I wasn't really feeling Mexican..I know, I know, so I just ordered a cheese crisp. My husband ordered the Expresso Burrito with Asada, the child ordered off the kid's menu. All items are only $3.99 and come with either rice & beans or fries. He wanted the kid's cheese crisp. I tried to get him to order something else..so we could share, but he wasn't having it.  My husbands Aunt ordered a Pastor street taco with rice.   Food came out quickly and was plated attractively.  My cheese crisp looked run of the mill, but I have to say it was exceptional. I'm really can't place what they did to that tortilla but it was delightfully crisp..almost like it was deep fried.  Husbands burro was of good size but he said the meat was cooked to much. I tried it and I would order it next time. To me the meat was carmelized from the grill and had excellent flavor. Aunt said the Pastor was good, she would visit and order the same thing again.  I did try the son's rice & beans. The beans had a good taste but the rice was just run of the mill spanish rice.  Our first dining experience at Anaya's was a excellent one, and it's a place we keep on our list. For 3 adults and a child our bill was only $40 and that included a margarita, Dos XX's and a soda. Fresh, fast food in a friendly, clean atmosphere. I hope they survive in this economy, it's a great neighborhood restaurant.
5 Found this very very nice Mexican restaurant close to 43rd & Dunlap  It's called Anaya's  Food is amazingly tasty  & the guys/dames who run this place are very hospitable & friendly!!! That means a lot coming from a picky eater & a food critic like me - as you know! U should come here with ur friends! They have a full bar!!
5 This restaurant is fast becoming our neighborhood restaurant... let me tell you why.  First, you feel at home, always a smile, super super clean, the service is fast but the food is delish and hot.  The Blue margarita... is must have!!!! after one, you can't drink and drive... hahaha, sooooooooo good.  Bottom line is, we love it... we go once a week, the price is so good, we can actually afford to go once or twice a week.  I hope it stays the way it is... plus my hubby loves when the waiter call him "my friend" LOL.
2 Uses lard and chicken stock.... Not very friendly or knowledgeable. Would not return.
4 This is a solid place! We have been here a few times and they get an A+ on, fresh tasting food, friendliness and cleanliness!  Everything we have ordered has been really good. Ceviche is great and is loaded with fresh seafood, tomatoes, cucumbers and avocado! .Yummy! Give them a try!
5 The BEST salsa lives here!  The restaurant is very clean, has cute booths, and friendly service.  Fajitas were tasty and we really enjoyed this restaurant.
5 I recently returned to the valley and found this gem in my old neighborhood.  Every dish my wife and I have tried has been great. Excellent spicy salsa! Love the ceviche appetizer and seafood entrees too.   Clean, bright and cheerful d√©cor combined with a great serve staff make this my go to Mexican restaurant.
5 This place was good ...i felt like I was at my friend Alans house!!! lets just say I felt like I was in Mexico with the music playing..the food was fresh very tasty. Chips in salsa was on point like a box cutter. People were friendly ..overall place was clean and I will be coming here more often ..no more Filismoothies for this litto stomach.
5 Met a coworker up at this place at first glance it looks like a generic Mexican restaurant chain that ends with bertos. Once I stepped in I thought I was in Narnia, colorful walls and animated tables and chairs filled the room. They were playing traditional regional mexican music reminded me of my friend Alan's house ( he's a Mexican that I met looking for work outside Home Depot) . The menu has fair prices for the quality of food they serve I ordered the huevos rancheros with a Jamaica ( you get one free re fill). The waiter was very friendly he looks like aziz ansari he was very efficient. All in all it was a good experience. I will be coming back to try the melon margarita.
4 Been here a couple times and I've left happy each time. The food is good, not authentic really, but definitely good. The margarita flavors are interesting (banana?) but also good. I would definitely come back. Oh, and parking is usually super easy because it's in a shared lot.
4 i went based on good to great recent reviews.and they didnt disappoint. i had machaca breakfast w/came w/rice n beans n tortillas. however, when asked for another order of tortillas i wasnt informed there was a charge. to my surprise it was $1.50 for 2 small flour tortillas. you can get a dozen  for .99........anyways food was good but lil things like that dont sit well w/me n im sure you can agree. like free refills or extra salsa come on guys...ill bring to their attention next time personally...
5 Great food, great service. Try the super hot sauce.
1 The restaurant was very nice looking and clean. My wife had the Arizona Chimi and said it was alright. I ordered the New york Steak and Mas AND IT WAS AWFUL!l!   I ordered it medium rare. It came out with a suspicious gray color and well done. The server offered to bring out another. When it arrived, it too was gray. Upon cutting it in the center, it was a dull color, yet some of the edges of the steak were deep red and cold.  It was then that I realized that they may put "grill" marks on the steak, they actually cook it in a microwave oven. I've seen that gray color before and the uneven (raw) nature of the cooking confirmed it.  I was polite in declining another "steak" yet the server never apologized and still charged for half the plate.  We finished our dining experience, politely paid the check, and left.  I doubt we will go back. Too many other choices out there and microwaved, cold steak is NOT one of them. This was around 4:30pm on Monday, 8/12/2013
3 Seeing all the 5 Star Reviews, I made a point of stopping into Anaya's for lunch today.  I ordered my usual once or twice a week Mexican lunch, a Chile Relleno Combo with rice, refried beans & a hard shell shredded beef taco.                                                                                                                                             `   THE BEST:     :-))  *  Stylish, casual, mid-sized full service restaurant with a full bar.  *  Friendly, attentive service.  *  Very inexpensive!  *  Both the chips & the salsa were 5 Stars!  *  Excellent menu choices & layout.  *  Good-sized Pablano Chile Relleno.                                                                                                                                            `   THE OK:     :-)  *  Portion sizes overall.  *  I thought the rice was a little better than average.  *  The beans & taco were passable.                                                                                                                                            `   The NOT-AS OK:     :-|  *  The music was playing too loudly.  *  My Chile Relleno seemed a little undercooked.   Chile Relleno & Taco Lunch Combo is only $6.25 (plus another 20% off for Srs. on Tuesdays!).     :-))
5 I have been here about twenty times. It was good from the start, but, every time there is some little improvement that impresses me even more. Last night I had theh 9 oz New York Strip medium rare, rice, whole pinto beans, a chile relleno. and some flour tortillas.  I always dump a whole little dish of their fresh salsa on my rice. I also had a margarita the way I prefer them with Cointreau and Corralejo Blanco Tequila. Everything was very tasty.  I will get the exact same thing next time.
5 Great quality! Best Mexican food in Glendale, nice decor, good service!
4 My first visit to this cafe and it was wonderful.I ordered the chipotle chicken, very delicious, good flavor, it was Saturday evening and to my surprise, there was a mariachi band, how nice to have a fresh new  restaurant in my neighborhood.
5 I've been in Arizona for 11 years and finally we have found a Mexican restaurant that we love.  In two days I've eaten here twice.  First day I had their street tacos and day two I had their carnitas and they were both excellent.  Anaya's is clean, comfortable, great prices and tasty.  I highly recommend it!
4 Clean place, great salsa, great service and really good food!  So glad we had lunch here. Do yourself a favor and try the Carne asada.
5 Anaya's is a great place to eat some legit Mexican food, and I'm from New Mexico where we love spicy. The salsa is actually pretty good and has a little spice to it. It's really hard to find good salsa in Arizona. So it's a pleasant surprise. If you have kids, they even bring out a not-at-all spicy version of their salsa and I find that to be awesome. I normally get the make-your-own combo plate with three items, chicken or beef taco, chicken enchilada, and red tamale. The taco is amazing 9 out of 10 times. That one time, it will come out a little to crispy or burnt. The enchilada is on point. As for the tamale, the first time I ordered it it was spicy and had great flavor. Since then, I feel that the masa has been extra lard-y tasting. So beware. If you're in the mood for an adult drink, try the "Bartender's Special Margarita" Mmm! All-in-all, they have great service, a great atmosphere and above average food. And for an added taste of Mexicana, go there on a Saturday evening for live mariachi music.
3 Perfectly good Mexican food in Glendale. The hot tortilla chips and spicy salsa keep coming throughout the meal. The carnitas were dry, yet had a lot of flavor. Margaritas were fine, typical sour mix and cheap tequila. The restaurant is accommodating to larger groups and splitting checks. This was my second time and I enjoyed it. Not the best mexican in the whole world, yet very tasty.  *BONUS - check in on yelp on your phone and take 20% off your bill
2 Over priced, ($23. for an enchilada dinner and a bowl of soup and 1 iced tea) small portions, (is there a shortage on rice and beans) food just warm, no hot sauce available, lousy service and they need to find servers that can speak English!  Plenty of better places around.
2 Went to try this after months of driving by. Its right by our house so we thought we would finally give it a try. The food was ok and way overpriced. I paid $10.99 for a chimichanga that was the size of a taco bell bean burrito and the beans werent very good either. I will not be back. Macayo's here I come!
5 A blurb in Phoenix magazine caught my eye (great chips and salsa and $3 happy hour margaritas) and the 4 star Yelp ratings said it was worth a try. Happy to report that this place exceeded all our expectations. Chips and salsa are excellent, the margaritas are great (though we missed the happy hour special) and the food is fresh and excellent. Yelp had a 20% coupon which they gladly accepted. Our food came and it was as advertised fresh and very tasty. The guacamole that came with my carne asada was in a fried tortilla bowl which I ate after wolfing down the freshly made contents. Overall the food and friendly service will certainly bring us back here again.
5 Excellent. Friends and I arrived there for an early lunch prior to our flight from PHX. Delicious food, fun atmosphere, and attentive service.   I with I lived in Phoenix so I could come back more often! We could not have been happier.
5 After numerous visits,  this restaurant is still tops! Great location and wonderful decor. Most importantly the food is awesome!
4 It's good food (what the rest of my party had) and great service, but my entree fell short. It wasn't bad just unremarkable. I mark a good Mexican restaurant by how well they make their chile rellenos - this one had the seeds still in it. Which shows lack of attention to details in prep and just ruins the chile. It was flavorless and I pushed it aside. Super attentive servers.  Fast refills. Really good prices for food and drinks, including Margaritas.
5 Fourth time in and has been excellent every time. Some of the best chips and salsa and excellent margaritas. Latest dish I've had was the Chile Verde, very fresh and tasty. Highly recommended.
5 We just discovered this place and loved it! I had the enchilada deluxe with ground beef and green sauce and my boyfriend had a carne asada burrito. Their food is just great and the staff very friendly. I enjoy coming here once a week, if you go on a Friday they have live music playing. It's very very nice and I recommend it to anyone looking for great Mexican food.
