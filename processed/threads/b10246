3 Relatively good Autozone located conveniently to my home. They have ok service and are pretty well stocked in all the regular merchandise necessary. The parking is nice as well. There are plenty of spots. Easy access too.
3 Old lady that worked there was a complete smartass with me when I asked about my car's oil and lit up service engine soon light. I didn't know much about the light and she completely made me feel stupid with her smartass attitude. She did tell me which one I needed though and she was pretty much the only smartass in that Auto Zone so it's not too bad in here.
5 Benjamin D. Was very friendly and helpful from from beginning to end. He was very knowledgeable with brakes for my 1998 Honda Accord Coupe LX, & recommended what I should do to the best of his abilities, thanks for everything Ben!
