5 Loved the people at Woof. I took my yorkie/poo in for first time today.  They finished in 1.5 hours and I was very happy with the results.  Staff is very friendly and seemed to genuinely care for my pet.  You have to make an appt but so worth it not having to leave your dog there for hours.  It was a calm and exceptionally clean environment!
5 I love how friendly the staff is at Woof! They always do a great job cutting my dogs long shaggy hair and she smells so good for the next couple of days! A very clean, cute place!
