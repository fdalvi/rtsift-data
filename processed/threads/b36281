5 To Whom It May Concern,  Today (Wednesday,September 19, 2012), Jordan Dove was assisted by the Branch Manager 'Rebecca Albrecht'. I was extremely satisfied with her professionalism and customer service skills, and the service One Nevada has provided me over the past few years has prompted me an interest to move my business account to One Nevada.  Genuinely,  - Jordan C. Dove
5 I want to thank Linda M. for contacting me on this matter and for being so helpful.  She was very understanding and made everything a lot easier experience with this OneNevada branch. I am updating this review because I do believe not everyone should suffer for one person's actions. I highly recommend this branch now due to Linda. Thank you again for your help.    **I don't even know where to begin.  I normally don't name names, BUT I do believe this is a time to do so. Reason being for present and future customers need to know what they're dealing with, and not to mention this certain individual needs coaching on how to handle a "professional" work environment.    First of all, I don't appreciate how you handled or lack thereof my husband's business.  He simply needed to do a wire transfer and you were so focused on his t-shirt you just had to have everyone look at it. When he left, you simply said everything is done. He left and you called me to say you made a mistake and we waited for you to call back and it has been 4 hours. I have called 5 times. Thank goodness someone helped us after the 5th hour. My husband was going to be late for work.   Rosie, I am breaking up with OneNevada. Your customer service skills need help. I understand you have a busy working environment but I know for a fact you have time to call your customers back. I'll be back on Saturday to close our account.  I hope this will help you to grow and learn how to handle a professional situation.  I only hope for the best.**
