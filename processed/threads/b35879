4 I stumbled upon this grocery store on accident; it was next to the UPS store where I needed to go. I'm pretty happy with what I found at Hmoob: a clean interior, a small but decent selection of canned goods (that weren't expired), a refrigerated cold case in the back containing very limited quantities of fish, pork, and offal (the fish was pretty fresh and very well cleaned), not the widest variety of vegetables but they were fresh, freezers full of frozen mystery meat (but also rabbit, quail, pheasant, silkie chickens), the requisite 20-lb bags of rice, and an aisle of cooking utensils and such. The atmosphere of the store was one of that about to close, sadly. I was the only customer there. Perhaps the out-of-way location and unconventional name doesn't attract its fair share of clients. Although I didn't find a few specific things I was looking for, Hmoob has enough of the basics that I would gladly add it to my expanding list of grocery stores to frequent. They do take credit cards (Visa & Mastercard) and EBT.
4 Found this Asian supermarket on google and it was great!  Very reasonable prices and good selection.  I was in a rush so didn't get to go down all the aisles, but will definitely be back.  Wonder why it didn't pop up when I put in Asian supermarket onto yelp... well anyhow, it should now for anyone else searching in the future.
4 I've been a loyal customer to this grocery store for several years now.  They offer some unique produce & meats that are often not available at other Asian markets, i.e., goat, rabbit, cow skin, pork belly, etc. The prices are somewhat reasonable. The owner is friendly, polite, & super duper hilarious. The only dislike I have is sometimes they don't stock up on products well, especially the yummy nam sausages lol.  I would definitely recommend this store to anyone!
