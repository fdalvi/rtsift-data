2 The work out itself is good! With that said, if you are looking for an experience worth the price they charge keep in mind that the staff can be rude, unhelpful, and unresponsive to issues (in my opinion that is not the best atmosphere to reach fitness goals).  They nickel and dime you at every turn. From the sign-up date, to missed classes ($10 fees, they should be lower and they should allow a shorter window to cancel classes), to canceling your membership (it is like trying to cancel something you bought off an infomercial, they just keep charging).
5 I Love Orange Theory Fitness.  The trainers, Roman, Swoosh and Brave  are helpful and watch to be sure you are doing the exercises correctly and push you to work hard.  I have not had a problem scheduling or rescheduling an appointment.  You have to be responsible for yourself and if you make a commitment to be there, be there!  Others might be waiting for your spot, so it is just considerate to give 24 hours notice if you can't make it. I am feeling better about my over all health and wellness since starting with Orange Theory.  Being a 43 year old woman, working out is not about "getting a hot bod" anymore, its about being healthy
5 On Spring Break I needed to find an intense workout that was similar to my current pre-Tough Mudder training at home. I decided to try OTF after hearing about it from a friend, and it turned out to be an awesome experience.   I like the fact that I could drop-in at my desired times with no scheduling issues.  The staff is super friendly/informative and I really enjoyed the instructors (Roman and Jesse) and their instruction styles.  While I am used to the tread and weights, it was the rowing machines that fascinated me and pushed my limits every time!
