3 I have been to Retro Bar on two occasions.  Both times were on a Saturday night and it was a pretty consistent experience.  The Retro Bar has a 60's space kitsch decor with rocket ships and stars, and perforated sheet metal accents.  The place is pretty big, but you enter from a small inconspicuous door from the street side of the building.  You enter a wonderful dance area but hardly anyone dances.  The music is pretty retro, 60s to today pop and dance hits.  Disco, 80s new wave/synth pop caught my attention.  The bar is on one side of the room and it stretches almost the entire length of the place, so it's not difficult to get a drink.  The bartenders are proficient and make great drinks.  If you are looking for a mixologist to concoct the latest trendy bev, this might not be the place to find one.  I had cosmopolitans the first visit and it was tasty!  The second visit, I asked for an Absolut Mandarin and tonic and got mostly absolut which was not a bad thing, but had to wait a bit for the ice to melt to weaken it a bit.  Needless to say, I only had a couple of drinks the way they were mixing that night.  There is a pool table out back and a smoking patio.  The crowd is very neighborhood-y.  Townies who live close by come in for a drink with friends, play some video games, listen to old favorite dance tunes, and then go home.  It's not at all a meat market, but some clientele, I am sure you know who you are, would like more fresh meat in there.  It's a friendly place where you get a nod or wave, but nothing too forward or aggressive.  My rec is to go with a bunch of friends and spend quality time with each other.  you can hook up later at some other place.

5 This is my new favorite bar.   The decor is awesome. They have rad-ass performers. So rad, in fact, that my Bird's parents now know she's gay because the Lounge singer used a gaydar machine on her and it went off the charts.   But let's talk about the important stuff.   $1 jello slime shots. Enough vodka to give you smell-chills and cheap enough to not be too upset about throwing it all up later.   They have Absolut Peppar. This is important to me as I like my dirty vodka martinis spicy. The spicier the better.   You simply must check this place out. I think I'm going to try to get my next birthday party scheduled here.
5 This place rocks. If I wasn't on a temporary, self-imposed rehab binge, I would be here every night. Especially Friday.   I walked into the bar and they have Star Trek mannequins. Um... hells ya!   I walked up to the bar and ordered myself a $1 alien slime shot (Hard core vodka jello shot with 7-up) and got MESSED UP.   I walked into the bathroom and guess what - they are unisex!   I walked back to the bar and ordered myself another $1 alien slime shot whilst I was serenaded by the amazingly gay lounge duo.   And most importantly, I found out that I too was gay. The lovely lady lounge singer used her gaydar machine and that thing practically blew up.   Sorry Dally.   There is nothing wrong with this bar.
3 Retrobar is now closed as a gay bar and has re-opened under some other name, now a straight bar.  A shame, really, because the decor was fun and it was in a NE location.  Oh well.
