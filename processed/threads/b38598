5 SAM IS AMAZING. Truly, truly, truly amazing.   I never trusted anyone to do my makeup before her!   I wish I stilled lived in Vegas and could be dolled up by her! But I definitely see her every time I'm back!   She knows how to play up my features and knows exactly what I want without me even telling her!!   I tell her all the time that she's going to do my makeup for my wedding and that isn't for a longgggg time haha.   She is amazing at what she does. BEST in the business guys. GO SEE HER.
5 Sam is awesome, she did my makeup for my 21st which is kind of a big deal and it looked INCREDIBLE, I could not have felt prettier. Not only is she talented but she is so nice and friendly, doesn't make things awkward and can really make you feel good about yourself. Not to mention that her makeup is always done to perfection. If you need your makeup done for any occasion, Sam is the one to go to.!xoxox
