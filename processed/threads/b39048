5 I love the OM bodyworks studio! I had a wonderful reiki session earlier today and still feel so centered and relaxed from it. Kathy and her studio have a great energy. It is the perfect place to get away for an hour or so to relax & have your energy/ body worked on. Kathy knows what she is doing & does it well. I highly recommend coming here
5 The best massage I've ever had. I was able to get to a me dative state. Thank you Kathy
5 Kathy is a gem in the desert. I have been going through a stressful time and when I go to OMBodyworks it melts away. Reiki and Massages are fantastic! The use of crystals placed on chakras is a revitalizing experience and there is a good chance you will be so relaxed you will take a snooze on the massage table. Just saying. Anyone looking for a great experience has to give OMBodyworks a try, you'll love it!
5 I hit the Jackpot with OM Body.. I found Kathy through Yelp. Her massage was gentle but deep working on every part of my body except for the obvious private areas. Be sure to get the directions to her office Yelp has the wrong address. Which made me 15 minutes late but kathy was still able to get me in. Thank goodness her next client could bump down 15 minutes Kathy if you see this I wanted you to know that I plan to bring in my husband for the couple massage.  Nice office small business and excellent work.
5 Second massage even better than before.. Thanks for working me in.. Kathy. I was able to snag a last minute opening.. You Rock!
