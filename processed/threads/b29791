3 Alright, I lived in this complex for 2 years and I do have some pros and cons to living at this place.  Pros 1. Sky Harbor is 5 minutes away 2. Downtown Phoenix is 10 minutes away 3. Old Town Scottsdale is 15 minutes away. 4. Arcadia is 2 minutes away. 5. Biltmore is 10 minutes away. 6. Washer and dryer in each unit. 7. On site gym with 2 pools.        As far as the complex itself goes it actually not that bad.  Outside aesthetics is pretty nice and is up kept quite well.  As far as the actual apartment, it's nothing special, but it doesn't look run down.  It's an apartment.  They provide a space for you and that's pretty much it.  Cons 1. It's not in the best neighborhood in the world. 2. There is not ample parking for tenants/guests. 3. The staff can be very pretentious 4. It can take awhile for maintenance to be done. 5. A lot of Riff Raff's live here.     All in all I didn't have a terrible time living here.  I met some cool people and a lot of douche bags as well.  I wouldn't live here again.
1 My boyfriend and I have lived here for a little over a year, and since the first week it's been horrible. We have loud people coming in and out everyday/night since the gates are ALWAYS broken. Bumping their loud music and honking their horns repeatedly. Our roof started leaking when those rain storms were here, took them 3 days to fix, and still hasn't fixed it from the inside. Someone always pulls the fire alarms late at night around 10-11pm. And the dumpsters are always full. People just throw their mattresses and old couches next them and they are there for days. The parking sucks. If you have company over they have to park outside of the complex on the side of the road cause there are NEVER any free spots. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. It's loud, dirty, and to expensive for what's going on around you. Not worth your money.
1 I agree, the office staff are sooo two faced! and managers change all the time! i've seen changes in management for the two years.. i've been with the apartment for two years and my experience keeps getting worst, the longer that I stay!  The only star I am giving is for the maintainance crew because they are the only people who are sincere about helping out.
3 I spent 6 months here, and I never really had any "serious" issues. I originally signed a 12 month lease, but ended up moving out earlier because my job moved me to another city.  Here were some Pros and Cons during my 6 month stay:  Pros:  - The grounds are very well kept. There were always landscapers out working, the place looked great from the outside in.  - Great location. The neighborhood is a little suspect, but everything you need is 5 minutes away. Home Depot, Petsmart, Fry's, Target, Wal-Mart. You're close to the freeway and Sky Harbor is about 10 minutes away. This is probably the most convenient location to have for a pretty reasonable price.  - The floor plans were very spacious and nicely laid out.   - I lived in one the buildings that faced out towards McDowell Road. This road is very busy all the time, and I never really had any issues with noise. However, if I opened the windows I would hear some traffic, but it wasn't bad. They also did a nice job with tree placement - every window in my apartment was surrounded by trees and it was really beautiful.  - No bug issues! I never had a problem with bugs of any sort...ever.  Cons:  - The complex is gated, however, the gates probably worked for 1 week out of the 6 months that I lived here.  - The parking situation is terrible. Each apartment has its own covered parking spot, but there are hardly any uncovered spots for guests. Also, people parked in my covered spot ALL the time. I had a corner spot, so not only did people park there overnight, but people would double park behind me and used that area to load/unload things. The towing policy isn't effective at all, so when people parked in my spot there was really nothing I could do about it.  - The appliances are very old. In the 6 months that I lived there my dryer broke, the garbage disposal was broken the day I moved in, the bathroom sink had to be replaced and a piece in the shower had to be replaced so I could get hot water running through it. On the plus side, the Maintenance guys were awesome, and all of my issues were resolved within a couple of days. It took about 5 days to get my dryer fixed.  When I first moved in there were always police helicopters flying overhead, but that only lasted a few months. There's definitely a lot of "rif-raff" hanging around the complex and living there. I lived on the second floor and I had a horrible family living below me that made a lot of noise and played music so loud every night I thought a night club was on the other side of the wall. They also parked in my spot constantly.  The walls were pretty thin in the bathroom, and I could hear the person next to me taking showers and I always heard their AC click on and at one point their pipes were leaking so I could always hear the dripping. Sometimes I could hear talking and I heard someone sneeze once. This was only when I was standing in the bathroom, though.  I never had my car broken into, and I never heard any stories of it happening to anyone else while I was there.  The fire alarm was pulled one night at around 3am and it was terrible.   All in all I would say I didn't hate it here, but I didn't love it here either. I never used the pool or the workout facility and I hardly ever went into the office or interacted with the management staff. If I had to move back there today I probably wouldn't.
