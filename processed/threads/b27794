5 All i can say is when you 17 yo son decides 3 days before Prom that he would like to go...skip Men's Wearhouse and head straight to the Men's Wear section of JC Penney. Great deals and really great service.
5 Surprisingly helpful staff on Black Friday... Didn't think it was possible! They helped me order the products that were already out of stock by the time I got there, and they took off the mail-in rebate on site!   Went to pick up the products today, and the customer service was wonderful again. Gotta love good retail staff!!!!
5 Oh JC Penney, how youve evolved.  Love the new look theyve given to this location. Items are easy to find. You wont see many sale signs as theyve switched to "everyday values" pricing. Things here are very decently priced. I personally love the Worthington brand, theyre great work clothes (stylish, yet durable). You can have things shipped to the store from their website, the pickup process is also fairly easy.  The staff here is very helpful, and you can almost always find someone to help you in any section.   This location doesnt have the bedding and housewares sections, theyre located by Sears in the JCP homestore.
5 This is a great location for starters. I do not think I had ever been in here until a few months ago. It is nicely laid out. With just about any thing you are looking for. The bottom level has a great hair salon, that offers all sorts of Beauty services. Which according to my girlfriend does not happen at a lot of the other locations.   They are back to their old ways and we like that. She loves the coupons and it always gives her an excuse to go in and shop some more. They have always carried some pretty good stuff. But, it does seem now more than ever , they really have nice brands and values.  Really nice service here and they keep the restrooms clean as well. Which of course is always a plus.
