4 I've found a new beauty supply to swear fealty to! This store is packed with both well-known and hard-to-find hair care and beauty products, along with hairpieces & wigs, styling appliances, accessories, tools, skincare, men's grooming, and a couple of drugstore cosmetic brands.   If you haven't been able to find that extra-gentle shampoo you used to love, they might have it here. And if they do the price will be lower than you're expecting. (Example: a scalp treatment I had to go to the dreaded Wal-Mart to find last week was almost a full dollar cheaper at BSW. And this is a product that is only around $4 to begin with. 25% less? Score!)  I could knock off half a star for the somewhat gritty feel of the location. The area feels a little run-down and the store itself has a plain cement floor and industrial style shelving throughout. Take the 'warehouse' part of the name very literally. The aisles and displays are also a little too close together, resulting in a mildly claustrophobic feel. The same goes for the parking lot. I imagine the narrow spaces barely hold larger trucks or SUVs.  But the 'cons' are minor quibbles compared to how frustrating it can be when you're searching for one specific product and just can't find it. BSW is easy to get to from Highway 15; check it out.  EDIT TO ADD: I checked the price of the scalp treatment mentioned above at a local CVS this weekend. $6.50! This means Beauty Supply Warehouse is almost $3 cheaper. And that is insane.
