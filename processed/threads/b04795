5 This store is a diamond in the rough.  First, let me say that I have purchased several computer systems from this location as well as had them repair other computers.   These guys have a vast array of experience in all things computer related and they have a very loyal folliowing of customers including myself.  Living in Surprise, I can say that going to AZ computer solutions is worth the drive!!
5 Yesterday had one of our desktops bootup to the "Blue Screen of Death" so took the system over to Scott's shop. Scott understood how important this system was to our business and immediately went to work repairing the system. At 7:00 pm he called telling me that it was done.
5 Can't go wrong with Az Comptech... My computer started to be really slow. To even open up a program, it would take a whole minute. I suspected that I was infected with some type of virus. I called up Az Comptech and talked to Scott who told me not to worry, he would be able to get my computer running at the normal speed.  I took the computer over to Az Comptech, and the next day Scott called me and told me it was ready to go. We booted it up right there in the shop so I could see that the computer was running normally again.  Overall it was a great experience. Az Comptech is a great computer repair shop!
5 Scott came out to our place today and fixed a computer networking problem that we had in no time flat and got our business back up and running!! Thanks again for your great services
