4 I lived in N. Las Vegas for 2 years. Within those 2 year I had been searching for a good, local taco place without success. I've tried Don Tortaco and Roberto's tacos, both of which failed my expectations. Then one day, I was drive home and saw this little sign "Tacos Michoacan;" so I had to try it. The day I was there (some time in May 2012), I got to chat with the owner (or one of the owners). Apparently, they've only been around for a few months and their specialty was al pastor. But of course, I had to try the carnitas and carne asada. The pork was good, the beef was great....but DAMN, was the al pastor rediculously great. They also have this super spicy citrus sauce. It might be a citrus habanero or something. You can't miss it: orangey-pinkish liquid. Try it, but you've been warned about the spiciness.  Unfortunately for me, I moved out of the state about a month after finding this place. However, I did come back several times before I left. The only downside is that the food is not consistent. In my opinion, the food is best when the owner is making the food. Therefore, if you try this place and you don't quite, enjoy it, chat with employees and ask about the owner. Find out when he is present and try the food again (and make sure you order al pastor that day).  I hope this place does well. It's not in the busiest of locations and can easily be missed while driving by. Make sure to try it out......and don't forget the al pastor.
4 Drove by so many times and today I stopped in. Had 2 carne Asada tacos and  2 carnitas tacos. Very good tacos with flavor. Right for the price. This is a little shop with friendly staff. Yes I would come back.  Mon - thurs .75 cent tacos
1 Lots of grizzle in both the burritos my wife and I had and tacos were dry. Quality has gone down the tubes and I will be going somewhere else.
1 I came here a little over a year ago and let's say I won't be going back.. like all the other comments, lots of grizzle. Oh and they also don't wear gloves or wash their hands after handling cash.
