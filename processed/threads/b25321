5 I have been a business customer when they were still Alltel. Josh and the whole staff have always taken care of me at this location.
5 Great service
1 I have been a Verizon customer for many years and this is the worst service I have ever received.  I expect the prices to be higher in a Verizon corporate store than Costco, Best Buy, etc (which they are).  However, I also expect the quality of the service and the knowledge of the products to be higher as well (which it is not).
2 best luck to wait in line for a guy behind the desk.  The other two sales associates were too busy posing as customers in an empty store to acknowledge the one customer, me, that was there.  This is a real change from some other verizon stores where somebody greets you, gives you a number, and the associates talk to customers and want you to buy their products.  Weird vibe in this store.
5 Thank you Tim for immediately addressing our problem with our iPhone 5 last week. You guys are amazing.  After an awful experience with the Germann and Gilbert location you really made our day!
