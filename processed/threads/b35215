5 As good as it gets. Excellent food in a fun atmosphere.
3 Okay burgers. Unlimited toppings for no extra charge.  Awesome fries. Cool soda machine.
3 Little expensive for a burger and fries, but it is a quality meal. Cajun fries are good and its always fun to watch the people try to figure out the soda machines. Has some hot dogs for kids as well. Even though the say all topping are free, when you are paying 8.00 for just a burger they are not free.
5 First time there and all I can say is that it was gooooood...  The only downside was that they were smaller than i expected, but good nonetheless...  I liked the free peanuts as appetizers while waiting for the burgers...
