5 I could've sworn that I wrote a review for Grouchy Johns but I guess not!  I think Grouchy Johns is a great Coffee shop!  They receive their coffee from a local coffee roaster and I love when small businesses are able to support each other.   The lobby has a great feel of homeyness when you walk into the place and it may be helpful to call it living room instead of a lobby!  The living room has comfy couches, chairs and tables for community to meet.   The last couple of times that I have gone inside the living room has been pretty full so thankfully I wasn't staying.  Games and books are available for your entertainment!  There is art from local artists on the walls that are available for purchase!    I also follow Grouchy John's on Facebook!  they often post specials or fun shenanigans going on at the store.    I love their coffee!  I do have to drive out of my way to get here so whenever I'm in the area, I stop by for a tasty beverage!  I also love the different options of beverages available.  They have come up with their own combinations of drinks which have proven to be quite tasty and something I would have never thought of that combination.    Grouchy John's also has a mobile truck that has been at a my work a few times!  I'm very thankful that my work invited them out so I didn't have to stop at another coffee shop on the way into work!   I'll be back in the near future!
5 Grouchy John's Coffee was brought to our place of work for the employees on a beautiful fall morning. Their truck was cool and the guys brewing the coffee were polite, pleasant, and knowledgeable of their coffee. I like things simple; therefore, I ordered black coffee without cream. The brew for the day was delicious! If they select great daily brews, then I imagine their other products are excellent as well. I will definitely be ordering from Grouchy John's again. Thanks guys!
5 I tried grouchy john's at first Friday and it was freezing that night! That might have added to why I loved my drink so much but it was really amazing.  I got Christmas in a cup it was a gingerbread white mocha latte.  It changed my life.  I literally raved about it to everyone it was PERFECT! The perfect sweet treat on a cold night. Not too sweet and just enough "coffee" flavor.  Doesn't it just sound delicious?   I tried to order the drink at Starbucks and it just wasn't the same. Since this is one of their signature drinks I just figure they spent time on finding the perfect gingerbread vs white mocha flavors.  Also my friend got one of their monkey drinks. Banana with Nutella maybe? I don't remember but it was delicious also.   It was made pretty fast, the girl taking the drink orders was nice enough, and the price was okay.
