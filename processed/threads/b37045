5 I am not a fan of getting my hair done; but Chanelle makes my visits to 'lose the grey' a worthwhile experience!  My hair always looks fantastic and she makes sure I'm up to date stylewise!  Lynne
5 Chanlle has been doing my hair for a couple of years now.  She is awesome.  Each time she does it I am very happy with the results and receive many compliments from others on it.
5 I am getting compliments galore on my new look!  The Brazilian blowout has changed my attitude about doing my hair!  My naturally curly hair is smooth, straight, and soooo easy to style!  No more wild bed head every day!  Chanelle is awesome!
5 Chanelle did a great job .  She's done my wife's hair for years and thought I'd give her a try.  I love the girl's attitude and skill.  Looks like my wife and I will be going to the same place now.  Highly recommend her
5 I had my first visit to Chanelle based on the reviews here on Yelp and Facebook (Hair by Chanelle). She is an excellent Hair Dresser and knows her craft. My hair has "challenges" and she made it look healthy with a perfect style. I already made my next appointment. HIGHLY recommend her!!! BTW, she is at another Salon now and she's waiting for yelp to update her profile. CNC Barbershop & Spa - (480) 766-9983
5 Chanelle does an amazing job on my hair.  I have very thin, fine and straight hair that is very difficult to get a good blunt bob.  When Chanelle cuts my hair in a Bob it is perfect!!  I can wash and go and I get lots of complements on my amazing cut!!
5 I first went to Chanelle while she was in school. She did such a great job with my cut and color that I have been going to her since!
5 I first went to Chanelle when she was in school.   She is such a natural and did an excellent job.  I have been going to her since!
