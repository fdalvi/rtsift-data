5 Douglas W. has it right.  You're basically on a mini-vacation when visiting Estancia, from the amazingly immaculate greens, breathtaking scenery of both Pinnicle Peak and the Valley, to the beautiful homes that line the course.  The course itself is quite diverse - one of my particular favorites is teeing off atop a 20-30 foot boulder and to have my ball sail across the wash below, complete with rugged steps to the top.
2 Nice place, but they think nothing of running their 100db grass blowers tractors before dawn on Sundays.  Really tee'd off the wife.
5 Absolutely beautiful! I think I could stay here forever and as soon as I hit the powerball I think I will!!
