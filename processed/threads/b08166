5 Super AWESOME! Warren our plumber from Kendall did an awesome job. Super friendly, productive and cleaned everything before he left. I will definitely call Kendall Plumbing again if my plumbing fails me :)
1 Customer service was bad enough that I feel compelled to write a review which I have never done before. The plumber came out and repaired the problem but left our water shut off at the house valve, no big deal really, but when we called in to see why we had no water and the repair was completed (even though the plumber never notified us he was here), and wanted to see if the plumber was on his way back and the receptionist was extremely rude. She told us that the plumber had left the water off because that was how he found it. Mind you both my roommate and I are off today, have used the water today and neither of us knew where the valve was or we would have turned it back on. This is where super receptionist comes in and tells me "what do you think my guy is a liar?" multiple time to which I finally responded "yes, yes I do!" It was a very simple fix, once she told me where the valve was I flipped on the water and life went on, but beware, if their guy messes up at all you will get defense secretary of the year on the other end of the phone.
5 Kendall Plumbing SAVED US!  After having 4 other plumbers come out to our small business, Kendall Plumbing and Rooter were the only ones who actually did something (not kidding)!   Kendall was professional, on time and diligent to find the problem (that the other plumbers didn't take the time/effort to find).  We are a small business and have two toilets on the premise and BOTH were clogging (sporadically) and eventually overflowing, leaving an office with 20 employees without the use of the facilities.    Other plumbing companies attempted, but in the end they left without doing anything to help (some told us "there was nothing wrong", others said they didn't have the necessary equipment, one said that they had been sued and could no longer snake from the toilets (what?!!), yet another just seemed to want to get home for dinner.    Kendall came in with a heavy duty snake and then took a camera to our system to try and see what else could be causing the issue(s).    Long story a little shorter, we are now back up and running and are grateful that Kendall Plumbing was able to do what the other guys couldn't do!
