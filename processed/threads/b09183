3 Well, contrary to the other person who reviewed before me --- I enjoyed me time (or maybe, rather, the person) there. I have been to Toni & Guy, Moodswings (twice) and Mastercuts...twice. Honestly? WAY cheaper, the stylists are far less pretentious.  1/2 times I went to MoodSwings: I loved it...but I can never get an appointment with the guy I had the first time.  Toni and Guy? Well they just don't listen to you..."Please don't razor my hair, you see that picture on the wall of the punk rock dude? DON'T do that!"  Guess what? ...They'll do it anyway.  Anyway, I digress ...  Today I saw Rebecca at Mastercuts. She was knowledgeable...took her time: Cross checked her lines, and the cut's length.  She suggested products but not overbearingly (ahem, Moodswings are you listening?) She also paid attention TO THE TEXTURE of my hair.  Something that the aforementioned place did not. "Let's just ... ignore the texture... and hopefully it'll work out!" Not cool.  Who knows, maybe I lucked out?  But that's great for me!  I can save $40 bucks, buy what I want...and have someone fun to chat with while my hair gets done : )  Pleased.
4 I'm unsure how to review this. I don't care for MasterCuts too much, but Ricky Cherry (Manager) is amazing. He is Picasso and my hair his canvas. He's fast and knows what he's doing. I wouldn't see anyone else there, but you have to go see him. Location isn't that great. It's at AZ Mills. (yikes)
