3 5 year warranty with watch battery (with receipt). But I think it might be expensive. I was in a rush so didn't have time to comparison shop.
3 I brought in a couple of watches that are family heirlooms and hadn't been working for a while.   They fixed both of my watches within a couple weeks. Both watches needed parts that are not readily available, but these guys ordered, and got me taken care of.  I'm not entirely sold on this place. For example, I asked if they were certified by Longines, and they looked at me like I was crazy.   I'd still come back--they took care of my stuff. You will probably pay a little more, but it's worth it, I guess.
5 This shop is great! They are fast, know their stuff and have helped me with everything from a custom piece, to repairing my favorite super delicate necklace.  I can't say enough good things.  Location is super easy as well - I park at Sears at PV mall and walk right through and the shop is right there.  Great staff - Great work - So glad I found them!
4 quick, friendly service!
4 I needed a ring resized. They did a great job. Very friendly workers. I was also able to use a 20% off coupon. I am happy.  Thanks!
