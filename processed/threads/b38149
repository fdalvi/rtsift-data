5 Simply Amazing///
5 We come here every weekend just to eat! Everything is clean and good to eat! And the people that work there all so nice!!!
4 This place is in the Fantastic Swap Meet, down aisle H-and booth 38.   They make rolls, hand rolls, Hawaiian sausage over rice and other snack items.  I ordered the sausage rice and a hand roll. The hand roll was a good size and the spicy tuna was fresh. The sausage was heated up and served over rice and it was delicious.   I think this is best food spot in the swap meet.
