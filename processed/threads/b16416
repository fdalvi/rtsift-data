5 La Perla.... sigh... this lingerie is just so classy and glamorous (not to mention expensive)! If you like intricate laces buy La Perla. This lingerie line is just sooo pretty and will be with you for a long time. Invest ladies... be sexy!
5 My weakness?  Gorgeous lingerie and ridiculously high-heeled shoes.  So, when I saw this store on the Forum Shops horizon, I couldn't pass it up.  La Perla is the mother of all lingerie shopping experiences.  Not for the masses (Victoria's Secret, I'm looking at you), but I'm sure that any woman could find something delicious to wear here.  The down side?  $$$$$.  Yes, folks, you will pay over $100 for a single bit of lace and silk that will caress your gentle lady parts.  While I wouldn't stock up on my underlovlies here, it is definitely a place to splurge.  So, I did.
5 La Perla is the Dom Perignon of lingerie.  Seriously.  If you crave luxury and beautiful things, then you have come to the right place.  Pair your gorgeous La Perla with pearls, couture and of course heels.   If you follow these recs, you will never go wrong.    Trust.  ;)
5 Having made it my mission to visit every La Perla store I come across (hmmm...perhaps I should trek to Italy and go to the original) I of course had to stop here while in Vegas.  This La Perla is very different from others I've been to- it's DARK.  All red and black.  Turns out this is one of their Black Label stores, which is the more naughty line from La Perla.  Very fitting for Vegas.  Staff is very warm and friendly.
5 Review by Sheila: *Sigh*.... La Perla... It calls my name and whispers to me...  Sexy Provocative Luxurious Romance Fantasies  The ultimate luxurious lingerie! The fit is perfect, the lacy fabric is soft, the look is hot, the feeling a little naughty paired with my sexy Loubatins!   I own it! * breathe* but I still want more...   I'll come again, and again and again..  *Sigh*  (`'*.//(*_*)\\.*')  (Note from Dave: whew... is it getting warm in here?)
