5 LVMPD fingerprint bureau was a great experience! The staff is very kind and on top of their game! I was lucky enough to get Amelia who is very professional and helpful! I was most pleased with her service and she made my experience a lot easier than I thought it would be. I recommend anyone to this location. Not to mention it is never too crowded and you will be in and out in no time :) .
3 Yelp 100 Challenge 2013- 26/100  Working within the gaming industry calls for certain licensing requirements, fingerprints and background checks included. My office referred me to this place and off I went.The fingerprinting itself was a painless and effortless process. I was done in a jiffy-- in and out in 30 minutes tops-Not too bad for any government office.   I didn't have to deal with ink stained hands, it's all digital!  The staff was friendly and seemed like they knew what they were doing. I did (8)sets of prints for 28 bucks. They only accepted cash so I had to hit up the ATM.
4 Need to renew the old sheriff's card.
3 Place takes over one hour to be called to the first window. After that it takes less than 2 minutes to get fingerprinted and get your cards and be out.  Kind of ridiculous.
4 I didnt want to come here. I doubt anyone is excited to spend an afternoon here. I needed to come to get a gaming card. I found the process very organized and simple. I wasn't thrilled to part with the money simply for a piece of plastic with my photo on it... But I did need it in order to get a job.  I waited about an hour or so for my number. Once my number was called, I was quickly moved from station to station. The staff was really easy going and the lady who was helping me even joked a little bit. I found the process painless. Be prepared to wait a bit because it probably wont be an in-out kind of thing.   PS. THEY ONLY TAKE CASH. So hit the ATM up before you come.
4 Quick and easy check in, get a number and wait. Today was Thursday about 8am and there were five ahead of me with three windows working.   My number was up, got everything paid and again, I had to sit and wait, but this time about five minutes and I was done.   Just one more thing, wait for them to print them, again just about 2-5 minutes. Staff friendly, helpful and quick.  Now, I just got to mail it in. A lot of work to renew a license, thank goodness it's only every six years!
