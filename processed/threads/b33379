1 Went for several back pain treatments with shots in my back.  Doctor did not explain what substance he was using nor the course of treatment.  Treatment ended when I received a phone call referring me to a chiropractor for pain relief with no explanation of why.  I returned each time he requested--oddly he gave me 4 shots of something within a 6 week period of time.   My back pain has been worse since this treatment.
5 I LOVE NOVOCUR!  Novocur has changed my life. I was on pain medication, couldn't get out of bed, and so sad that I couldn't function physically anymore. NOW- I am able to move, workout, and live my life without pain. The staff at Novocur is extremely loving and kind.  Novocur treats me like I'm family.  I recommend Novocur to everyone I know with chronic pain.  Thank you Novocur!
1 Not recommended. website very misleading. whet in to see the doctor and told me my only option was steroid injections and that all the information on the website was wrong the first thing out of the doctor's. mouth was to call me a lair. should have his medical licence suspended should be a negative five star
