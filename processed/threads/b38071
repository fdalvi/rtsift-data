5 Hotel Del Kacvinsky is a quaint little place set off the strip away from the hustle and bustle of the casino life in Vegas. It's the perfect little retreat if you just need to be in Vegas but don't really want to be in the "sin" part of Sin City. The owners treat you right, are very welcoming, and make your stay quite enjoyable. The accommodations are quite lovely and the meals are amazing (be sure to ask for the white chocolate and blueberry bread-it's to die for). This husband-and-wife team have everything you need to make your stay most enjoyable. I'm sure it will be a vacation you will not soon forget.
5 I just spent my most recent visit to Las Vegas at Hotel Kacvinsky. And it was fabulous.  This newly wed husband and wife team truly know how to set the tone for a relaxing vacation.  With personal tours around the city (including the strip), homemade breakfast and memories that will last for ever, this vacation get away embraces all the aspects of relaxation with the comforts of home.    This vacation spot is perfect for individuals or couples looking for a comfortable get-away from home life and an opportunity to spend quality time with incredible friends.   Thank you Hotel del Kacvinsky for making my spring break the greatest one ever. Love you both.
5 A TOP notch place!  Wow, I was treated so well, like family!!!!   The place is beautifully decorated, super comfy guest bed, AND the meals, to die for.  The hosts are lovely and funny too.  One of the most relaxing yet fun weekends ever.  Thanks to the Kacvinskys!!
