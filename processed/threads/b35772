4 Excellent job!!
1 All I wanted was for my car to be cleaned. First I get there and as one of the girls is vacuuming my cat she's looking at her phone. Second there's like 2 cars being cleaned, mines being the 3 and there's like 6 people. Lucky the older lady there was about the only one doing her job. She cleaned it and the girl who.from before was vacuuming my car starts to clean it again. Anyways I SPECIFICALLY asked for NO air fresheners. This guy comes up to my car and starts to spray air freshener. Ugh!! I was very frustrated and NEVER will I go there again. All because I didn't want to drive to my regular car wash
5 Second time here, and not a single problem.  They do a great job here!  Oh, and that 1 negative review is absolutely ridiculous.  Makes little to no sense.  These guys actually do an excellent job!
