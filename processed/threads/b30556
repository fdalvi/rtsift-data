5 Ever been completely blissed out in a great massage?  Well you will be in Melissa's hands.  She is very intuitive, compassionate & talented at her craft.  She is able to customize the massage to my needs.  I love the way she melts away my aches & tightness with her truly healing touch.  All my troubles seem to melt away and I leave feeling high on life.  Thank you for the amazing body buzz!
5 One of the best massages I've had, well worth the charge.  Melissa provided a very professional massage.  I asked for a 90 minute deep tissue massage and she delivered a wonderful massage that got the kinks, knots and stiffness out of my body.. I'll be back and would highly recommend.
5 Melissa was super friendly. personable, and very accommodating. My wife is almost 36 weeks pregnant with our second child, she was miserable and having only a few hours of sleep a night. Melissa gave her a pregnancy massage with rubbing her tummy towards the end and relieved my wife of her aches, pains, and kinks... Since then she has gotten more than 6 hours of sleep. My wife is super happy.. I definitely know what to get her for Mother's Day!! Thank you so much Melissa!!
