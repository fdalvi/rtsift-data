4 I've been here twice during my busy lunch break, and I've been very happy with the service.  The price is also great.  I really love the 3 veggy sides; I usually do the macaroni and cheese, house salad and french fries.  You can't beat that for $5.99!  I'm also very impressed with how fast and attentive the servers are during this busy time.  I found the host to be friendly and quick to seat us as well.  I would come back any time for lunch!
4 I always receive good service here, went yesterday around lunch time and was seated promptly.  Food came out in a very decent time frame.  2 entrees and an appetizer for only $20 YOU CAN  NOT BEAT IT!  And the food was excellent  Also, there is karaoke until around 2am, I'm not sure exactly what nights besides Friday's and Saturdays, but it's always entertaining!  Check the location out for sure :)
2 I have been to this location 2 times during lunch because it is close to my work. I didn't think the service was that great either time. The food is good though. I will probably be back to this location unfortunately because there is not much around this area to eat when you only get an hour for lunch.
2 I went on Thursday which is Kareoke night loud and drinks are 1/2 price. Food isn't any good though
3 No more breadstick for you ...    My co-worker and I went  to Applebee's for lunch, it was after 1, so we figured the rush would be gone. We each ordered the USS (unlimited soup and salad). While we were eatting our server asked if we wanted to have another go around of soup and salad, while I love love soup, I am not big on salad, so I said I would have soup and another breadstick, he said sorry we are only allowed to give one breadstick per USS deal. What? Really? Yep, if you want unlimited breadsticks you better head east to Olive Garden. I will say that it is a good deal for the $6.99 price, if you are a salad fanatic, then you will love the 8 varieties to choose from and the cup of soup is a hearty portion.
1 This food sucks. I would rather spend 20 cents on ramen noodles because I would end up happier. Even when a coworker drags you here just pass on putting any of this in your mouth. No matter how hungry you are!
2 slow slow slow ... turtle or snail slow service
3 The Applebee's on Elliot is a Big NO for me. Service is very slow & they didn't even give me the correct amount of food I paid for! I will say that I do go to the Applebee's on 24th & Baseline quite frequently. It's good for a quick drink, food is average, service is ok! Like going during non-busy hrs to avoid the crowd. Drink of choice is the Blue Moon or Long Island Iced Tea
1 Horrible... I ordered car side to go because I was in a hurry and thought it would be a good way to save time. I placed my order with a server who didn't know anything about the menu or lunch specials. I was told my order would be ready at 1:30 and asked what type of vehicle I drive. Pulled up in the car side spot around 1:40 and continued to sit in my car and wait another 8 minutes. Finally walked in the side door to a server who was standing there talking on the phone. He acknowledged me while still on the phone and I told him I was picking up an order to go. He looked at a few tickets and didn't bother to check the bag that was sitting right in front of him, said it would be a few minutes and then moved to another station to get on a personal phone call. Waiting another couple of minutes another server came out bringing drinks and asked what I needed. Finally he was able to get me my food that was sitting at the station the whole time. I let him know I was out there waiting 10 minutes and that there was another car there waiting too. This is just ridiculous whats the point of car side. I may be able to understand if it was busy but the place was dead and servers seem to care more about their personal phone calls then their customers agenda.
1 Horrible! Waited 40 minutes on a Wednesday at 2 pm. there was a line out the door and only 3 tables were taken. no one came up to us for 15 minutes and he was rude and dirty. waitress was rude and had dirty fingernails. she kept sighing and grunting and would just throw stuff on our table. hamburger was served raw. Literally RAW. Won't even go on about it. Ruined appledbees for me forever. Stay AWAY!
3 It's applebees what can you expect. The server had too many tables, the drinks were slow due to the bartender serving too many guests. I sort of expect it though. That's why I normally sit at the bar and will from now on. The Happy hour is nice though.
5 I always love a trip to the neighborhood Applebee's in South Phoenix when I'm in town. The recent remodel looks great. Service, drinks, and food were excellent tonight!!!
1 Dropped my daughter off at her in laws house in South Phoenix and my son and I had some time to kill before we had to pick her back up, and I wasn't into driving back into Chandler. I asked my son if he wanted to go visit our old Applebee's.  We use to live in South Phoenix for 8 years, and Applebee's on 24th st & Baseline became like a family/friend hang out for us.  So off we went, it was 7pm on St Patty's Day but only had a 15 min wait, which we thought was pretty cool.  When we got to our booth, we talked about the times we had been there , and how one time my son was just being a jerk and the rest of us were starving and he only ordered celery, it was fun talking about the old memories.  We went with the 2 for 20 deal, and the food tasted great, our service was friendly and fast, it was the end of the meal and we just paid and then my son looked down on the floor and just said oh my, I looked at him because he doesn't say that that much and I said whats going on,  he said mom, just move fast and lets leave a mouse just ran by our feet...I said WHAT!! He said yes, it was this big showing me with his hands and said just move carefully and lets go, let me tell you I wanted to puke my dinner up right then....but I didn't, I left the tip, because she was good, and we left.  Yes I did tell Patrick the Kitchen Manger that my son had saw a mouse, he told me that they come from across the street and that he will notify his pest control guy.  BUT OMG!!! I hate mice, I will not be coming back, I know it happens more often than I would like to know about, this was a place that held some fun memories for us, but I am not looking to go back any time soon.
1 If only I could give negative stars! When I arrived It was fairly busy though we were able to be seated right away. Our server was awful. She took our drink orders with what seemed like an attitude and very little patience she stormed off before I could finish my sentence. After a while she returned with our two waters and a lemonade, at which time she took our orders. The appetizer we ordered took over 20 minutes to arrive and was burned when it did! So much so I was insulted that our server would even bring them to our table. I said excuse me to the manager who ignored me completely and continued to a another table in our area. When she finished her conversation she finally looked up and acknowledged that I'd spoken to her and returned to our table. Confronted with the burned food she seemed annoyed but apologized and had them replaced. The server refreshed my drink and returns it a watered down version of the first. After another 15 minutes I was able to get her attention and another 10 after that my drink was replaced. Our appetizer came out followed by the food 30 minutes later minus my sons grilled cheese which took another 15 minutes after getting her attention,she'd forgotten about it. We asked for more water which we didn't get. The manager never checked in again no further apologies or concessions given. We were given no flatware or napkins and were treated horribly! Slow service, dismissive staff, very poor customer service. Only positive was the hostess was accommodating and helpful. POOR SERVICE!
1 After a terrible experience another manager called and apologized profusely the Monday following my experience. He offered to send a gift card so that my family could return and give the restaurant another try. I told him that honestly we wouldn't be returning to that restaurant but would be willing to try again with another franchise. Without disclosing an amount he took my address down assured me he was sending it right away. This was on the 29th of March the envelope wasn't even postmarked until the 13 of this month OVER two weeks later. I just received it today! Never mind I had to call them on Monday the 15 to be sure it was even sent on top of it all the sent a measly $25 for the three of us. I spent three times that amount while I was there! Just feels like a cheap attempt at getting us there to spend more money rather than a comp for HORRIBLE service. Really Awful all the way around! Had he told me he was sending $25 I would have told him to not even bother. If I were you I wouldn't bother with them either plenty of better food in other customer friendly franchise's.
4 Food at Applebees tis just okay, got their soup and salad which is a good deal.  Caylee was our server and she was great so that is why they got 4 stars!
2 Ok for a quick lunch. The server was nice, but the food was average at best.
1 If I could go negative, I would and I am usually a big fan of Applebee's! Had the same experience with the gift card fiasco as someone else reviewing and it didn't impress me.   Called in car side yesterday and showed up at time they said.  Sat in my car with another customer beside me for over 5 mins, no one came out. I called the store and they sent someone out to get my name and order!! Um, didn't you get all that PLUS make n color when I ordered?!? He had to then go back in to get it.  I was livid by now so I just gave him the cash and drove off.  Never again will I go to this one.  I will drive outta my way next time...
1 Awful experience. My girlfriend and I just wanted a quick bite that wouldn't make us feel like crap, so we fell for the Applebee's ad for low calorie options. We got there and we're seated near the door despite there being plenty of room in the restaurant. They seated a man who appeared to be homeless and providing his own beverage choices (he poured a clear liquid into his water glass).  We didn't get to order for about 15 minutes. We both ordered an under 500 calorie meal and neither of us finished it. It looked like a diet microwave meal dumped on the plate. Some of the shrimp were overcooked and rubbery while others were undercooked and translucent.   Not going back, even though it is just down the street.
1 They do not even earn a star, came in explained we were there on lunch break. We all ordered soup and salad. It took about three try's to get that correct. The server blamed the kitchen, shouldn't they check the order before serving? The manager was ambivalent at best. The worst going back to work hungry and disappointed.
1 This is the worst Applebees I've ever set foot in. So ghetto that they have a police officer that just hangs out in the restaurant, definitely something I don't want my children seeing.  The staff is rude and disrespectful. Never will I set foot in here again.  I can't believe corporate hasn't shut this place down yet.
1 Three of us went for lunch on a Sunday at 24th & Baseline. The place was pretty empty. We all ordered the all you can eat soup and salad.  It took forever to get our food so when the order finally came, we put in our second oder.  The next round finally came (which again, took forever)  and we did not get breadsticks this time.  I advised that we did not get breadsticks and we were told we only get one on the first order.  Please note, that if you read their menu, it states,  ALL you can eat, Soup, Salad AND Breadsticks.  They should read their own menu.  Won't go back. poor service, lack of knowledge.   They need a new training program/management team. I have experienced poor service at ALL Applebees.   usually a manager comes around and asks if everything is okay.  NO sign of a manager at all.
1 Toooooooo freaking bright ,  i am gettin lightbulb burn.   Servers sitting at the bar with their uniform.  The bartender took 8!minites to acknowled me.   Toooooooo bright! Not likelly to return :-(.
1 The good was TERRIBLE! In addition to that the service was even WORSE! No ice, the food was not cooked properly as well as it took forever for anything to finally make it to our table! We will never return to this particular place AGAIN!
2 This Applebee's is so crowd I hate going there. The wait is alway ridiculous. Which I don't really understand why. The food is bland and cold unless you get a skillet steak. The happy hour is okay bit even then it still classified as bar food at best. My recommendation is find another place.
