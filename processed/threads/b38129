5 Written by my Wife~Optician/Owner Jim of Licata Optical knows about customer service! He was so helpful with my initial questions about my insurance coverage, and figured it all out. Jim then patiently assisted me in finding just the right pair of new eyeglasses-and I am admittedly picky. Finally, we went over each item I might need for my new glasses line by line (clearly explained), and he didn't push anything, just recommended and helped me pick out what I needed. Truly the best customer service I've enjoyed in quite some time. Forget big chain retailers-go see Jim at Licata for a great eyeglass shopping experience
5 Jim is amazing. He spent 30 minutes speaking with my husband about his glasses and his options for getting prescription sunglasses (limited, as my husband has an extremely unusual eyeglass prescription) and showed us many frames to choose from. Later, he spent a good 20 minutes adjusting my husband's frames so they fit him perfectly! Jim is not actually in-network with our eye insurance, but he has our business for life. You just don't find customer service like this anymore!
5 Took my grandson for an eye exam and it was determined that he needed glasses. The Dr. was wonderful and took time to be sure he was getting the correct prescription. Jim took over to assist with choosing the proper glasses. We returned to spend time getting the proper adjustment. Jim is very personable and offers advice which we needed. We returned to be fitted for contacs. The initial contacs did not work well so we returned and Jim recommended another brand. This time it was very successful. My grandson is very happy, Jim takes time to provide excellent customer service and we are very happy with the cost and time spent with us. I would highly recommend! Christine and Dylan
