5 I just had Real Fast do 2 windshields for me today. I was very surprised that he was actually early for our appointment, so that scored points right away. Both vehicles were done quickly, and the price was very reasonable. I hire installers at least 10X a month, so I will definitely be using them again.
5 I had real fast auto glass come out to Tempe from Mesa to do the windshield on my wifes car, they did a fantastic job worked with my insurance and my wife said they called when they said they would and showed up on time! plus they gave me $100 restaurant gift card for getting my windshield replaced and the gift card actually worked! no gimmicks just good quality service a great small business I'm a  REAL FAST AUTO GLASS CUSTOMER FOR LIFE!
5 I was driving down the road behind a semi truck and it threw a large rock and cracked my window right in my line of vision! I called real fast auto glass, they handled everything with my insurance so I didn't have to and they came to my house the same day! They were very polite and professional.  They got the job done quick and did an amazing job! They also gave me $50 cash and a free tint strip on my front windshield! I will defiantly be doing business with them again and will be referring them to all of my family and friends!
5 I have used this company for my 08 Nissan and my 06 Ford F-150 and am very pleased with the work, and timely manner in witch it was taken care of.  The owner was the one replacing my wind shields and was very detailed in his work with out taking up a lot of my time.  I have already send 2 people to this company and both also are very happy with the work and I was even given a great deal on tinting my Nissan for the referrals.
5 Contacted Real Fast... about tiniting the windows in my new car.  Joe and his guys price was much less then the dealership and I was very happy with the results.  We noticed some to the tint peeling up and Joe's guy came right out and resolved the issue.  Very good service.
5 Two days before leaving on a road trip I got 2 rock chips in addition to the 2 I already had!  I was getting ready to leave work and found this company with great reviews on Yelp, but thought they would be close to closing for the day.  I called and Joe said he could have someone out to my house before 8 pm. He made it to my place 15 minutes early!  Fixed the 3 tiny ones and one starred chip, then found a 5th!  Yes, he fixed that too!  Prices were better than anywhere else I have ever heard of, and the service was exceptional!  I will be back, and will recommend to all I know!  None of the chips have spread or starred in the month since he came out. Thanks Joe!
5 This is a mobile only service. Still half the price of Safelight. Fast and friendly service and warranties chip repair FREE for the life of the windshield. Took 30 minutes. This is my goto from now on.
5 It's not very often that i find a business that deserves a 5 stars, this one does. When I spoke to Joe the owner, he was friendly,and service oriented. He asked if I would like it repaired today. I said yes. He showed up within 3 hours replaced the window in less than an hour. He pointed out the poor workmanship on the old windshield  caused the window to crack. His price was a 60.00 less than the best rate I could get through my insurance company. I did not have glass coverage. It was  a great customer service experience
5 So I'm not really sure who you are going to for auto glass...but if it is anyone else besides Real Fast, shame...shame on you.  Pricing is phenomenal and Joe or his guys come straight to you. So...you don't have to go anywhere...or sit for an hour at a shop...they come on your time. Yep, I said it. They schedule time to come out to you.  The owner (mentioned above) really cares about his business and will do anything it takes to make his customer happy. I guess you can say...I'm a "lifer"!   Oh yeah...and the truck that came out to fix my windshield was this crazy lifted wrapped truck too. Coolest truck I've ever seen. Just a side note for you truck lovers out there.
5 I called Joe @ Real Fast Auto Glass on Friday morning to schedule an appointment to have my windshield replaced. I assumed being such late notice he wouldn't be able to get out to me until after the weekend but I was definitely wrong. Saturday morning, bright and early, was Joe knocking at my door trying to wake me up. I also wanted my entire windshield tinted and he had absolutely no problem getting this done for me at an amazing price ($50 less than competitors).   9:00 AM - Joe knocking on my door 9:15 AM - Me waking up because I forgot I made this appointment (it was my birthday on Friday so cut me some slack here!) 9:50 AM - Joe knocking on my door again - DONE!   Joe's amazing service, professionalism, and dedication to his business is nothing short of perfect.   It's too bad Joe doesn't cook burgers, clean houses, or babysit because he would be my #1 contact.
5 I saw the truck driving down the 60 and admired the lift.  I needed windshield repair and called for a quote.  Joe showed up withing 45 minutes after calling.  Fast, speedy and friendly.  Took the time to explain what a proper install looks like.  Class A guys.  Not to mention the best price out of all the quotes! Going with these guys was the best choice!  If and when my windshield cracks on my other vehicles, I will be calling Real Fast!
5 Just had my windshield replaced by this company.  I experienced wonderful customer service.  Joe is the one who came out to replace the windshield.   The phone calls were professional and friendly.  When Joe arrived, he did not realize that the new windshield he had for me had some nicks in it.   It must have bumped one of the other windows.  He called and advised me that he would have to leave to go get another one.   He wasn't gone long and he was able to replace the windshield in a timely manner.   I love that they will come to your location of choice saving you from having to take time off from work.   I would highly recommend Real Fast Auto Glass.  I will def. use this company again.
5 Giving this company five stars is a no-brainer, especially with people like Joe working for them. I had Joe help me when my brand new mustang was nailed by a rock on the 51. He moved mountains to get my windshield replaced in a timely and convenient manner. Not only is he a perfectionist, but he has a great attitude and does the job with a smile. I had also called around to a few other companies in the area, and Real Fast Auto Glass had the best price I could find by far. I hope my new windshield doesn't get cracked again, but if it does, my first call will be to this company!
5 Needed to replace my windshield after Safelite came out to repair a chip and the entire windshield ended up cracking (Safelite did a poor job on repairing a chip on two of our cars windshields). Talked to Joe on the phone who was very nice and professional. There was some issues on their end coming out on time but Joe handled the situation accordingly and professionally. It took about an hour to replace however they come out to you which is very convenient. Would definitely recommend.
5 Best service for windshield repair I've ever had. My husband and I are now fans Joe was polite and professional . He did the job quickly  and even took the time to scrape goo off the vin number for me.great same day service!
2 Let me start off by saying that I really, really, really had much higher hopes for this company as I found them here on Yelp and saw nothing but 5-star reviews.    We needed a windshield on one of our company vehicles replaced.  I called on a Thursday and spoke with Joe.  He seemed very eager to accommodate our busy schedule and I was grateful for that.  Joe stated that he had the windshield we needed and could have a 6" tint strip installed before they arrived for an additional $15.00.  Sold.  He set an appointment for Saturday at 10:00 am.    Saturday morning, no one showed up.  We received a call from Joe later in the afternoon stating that he was having brake issues with his work truck.  I completely understood and wouldn't want anyone to be put at risk for the sake of replacing a windshield.  We agreed to reschedule for the following week after his truck was safe to drive.  I believe it was a Tuesday evening that we rescheduled for, and I even gave him a 2 hour window to work with (5:00--7:00) because he was coming from Mesa.  I thought, "Surely he will redeem himself."  According to the owner of my company, Joe showed up after 7:00 without the tint strip installed on the windshield.  He did offer to reduce the price of the windshield for the missing tint, but that only meant that we'd have to find and install the strip ourselves.  Joe also stated that we "never requested a tint strip..."    Overall, I was very disappointed with this company.  The reason I gave two stars is because he had the best prices of anyone that I had called, but I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd much rather pay a little more and have my time treated as though it was valuable and get what I was promised.
5 I called Joe at Real Fast Auto glass and he exceeded my expectations!!! This is the ONLY place I will be going for all my auto glass needs. Joe is professional, reliable, extremely fast service and he did such a great job on my 2013 Toyota!!! Not to mention, he got my rain sensor, fancy pants windshield at the best cost out there!!! A fraction of the Dealer's price!!! My car needed three windows replaced and Jo helped us get the glass within 24 hours and he came to my house and got the job done!!! Thank you Joe, for being an honest, hardworking company we can rely on!!! Real Fast Autoglass is the only place to go! I am sending any and all business to Joe.
5 I called to have my windshield replaced and it was painless. Joe set up the call to my insurance company and scheduled for it be replaced at my office. He came at the time he said we would and had it ready to go within an hour. Will recommend going forward.
