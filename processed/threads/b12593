2 Food is pretty good for bar-type selections. Prices are competitive with most "franchise" restaurants/bars. They have karaoke, BuzzTime trivia, pool tables and some video games. Place offers live music on Friday and Saturday nights. Most days/nights plan to sit at the bar. Table service is very much lacking beyond that distance. This also happened during the 2006 NFL season. I don't know what it's like this year; haven't been back for football since. Overall it's a nice neighborhood bar.
4 BarWinkles. I've never lived closer to a bar; yet somehow I patronize thee rarely. I do say that the live music is quite enjoyable, although I must admit to preferring to sit with friends on my apartment balcony drinking a microbrew and singing along, rather than sipping Coors with the band.
1 Ewwwww, this place is gross. Kinda smells like a urine trough without the blue smell good thingy.
