1 This use to be a great place until someone took over the business a few months ago! I was nice and tried out the new staff (big mistake) it took 3 different people to get my pedicure, French tip and flower done, and even then it wasn't done nicely.  I ended up being there 2 hours just to leave so frustrated and disappointed..my cousin went after I did and the same exact thing happened to her..it's too bad because alot of my family were regulars there for many years and now we are definitly going to find a new place..We miss you Vivian!!

4 Great pedicure!  Sonny was incredible. Professional and what a great massage. Found this gem after a lot of looking. You won't be disappointed.
5 I have been coming here for quite a while now. They do a great job ans the prices are very reasonable.  They are very friendly and always welcome walk-ins. They do get quite busy on the weekends. Their Spa Pedicure is AWESOME!!!
