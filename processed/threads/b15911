5 Great guys.  They replaced our unit and were VERY knowledgeable and pleasnt to work with.
5 I first found discount in June 2012 and was very impressed.  I am a property manager with more than a dozen old cranky air conditioning units to deal with. Discount sent Earl, a VERY knowledgeable tech who has been in the business a long time and really knows his stuff!  The prior air company said I needed a new unit that would cost over 7500.00 and take weeks to install.   Earl fixed it right away (low freon) and its been going strong since (its now the end of Sept 2012)  Second review September 26, 2012 Thank god for discount, again! We had an ac failure and the home warranty co sent a hack who told me i needed a new compressor for 2750.00.  I called Discount and they sent Earl again and he had it diagnosed and running in no time at all.  He explained in detail what went wrong, how I can prevent it next time, and what he did to fix it.  A few hundred $ later its back up and running. I have had a lot of experience with ac companies and none were worth mentioning in the past, but Discount has been great to work with, and very honest.
5 These guys know what they are doing and act like it.  Quick to respond, quick to accurately diagnose and quick to repair.  Had a unit on a four plex go bad, they diagnosed, prepared two options and had it fixed the next day.  They are definitely teh go to a/c company for me.
5 August '13 update. It's been a year now and discount has never disappointed.  I'm up to 20 units and every summer they have trouble and discount is there for me at every turn.  Thank you discount!
5 Feburary '14 update. This has been a brutal winter for us, heaters have had a hard time keeping up.  Discount has been there with out fail every time.  We are going on two years with discount and they have been excellent at every turn.  Great service, extremely knowledgeable techs best prices in town, and when they fix it it stays fixed!  I highly recommend them!
