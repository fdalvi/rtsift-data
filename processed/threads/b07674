5 I came in today to ship some packages because the post office was a mad house.  It was busy for a kinko's, but I was helped promptly and efficiently.  I get a discount with my company to ship things here, so it is a great alternative to waiting in line at the post office.  I have also used this location to fax and it was fast and simple to do.
4 I had to mail my books back to school and the service was amazing. They got my shipping label printed and all I had to buy was a $2 package. I've come here on several occasions for copies, printing, etc. and enjoy the well kept facility. Right off the access road and easy parking. Great place to get all my shipping and printing needs taken care.
1 don't come here for photos for your passport it's a big rip off $16.95 avoid it like the plague everything is overpriced!
