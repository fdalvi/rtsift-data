4 Good place to watch a game in an extremely casual atmosphere.  Decent food.
4 This place is a great grab and go spot. They have what the people want a price that is fare. Better prices than the other guys.
5 Food was delicious - So much so we went back the next day and ate again! Be prepared - it's a little pricey but you have to treat yourself once and awhile.
5 This place was great!!! I didn't think the price was too bad considering we were in the casino on the strip. We went to see Celine Dion but needed to grab a bite first. We got the wings and and nachos. Both were delicious. The wings were cooked perfect. i don't like when the chicken seems really wet on the wings. They cooked them so the juice was still in them but not too juicy and a perfect amount of wing sauce so you still had the flavor of the chicken. The wait was minimal and the service was quick. I would come back i saw several items at other tables that made my mouth water. FYI portions are large enough to share.
