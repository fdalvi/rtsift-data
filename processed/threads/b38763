5 The best Pizza I've had 15 years.
1 WORST customer service ever. Was hung up on, was argued with, was talked down to. I called back to try to speak to a manager, owner supposedly answered the phone and proceeded to call me a liar regarding the situation I had and all around did not care about the customer service...if you can call it that...that was provided by his employees. Will never order from there again.
5 We just moved to the area and wasn't sure where we could get amazing pizza and wings from. Angelo's Pizza Kitchen not only left a menu on our door, but when we did some digging we found that they offer a 10% discount when you order through mypizza.com, so we decided to try it out.  Now, to be fair, the wait was a little long, we waited about an hour and ten minutes for our food, but when I called to ask about it the girl who answered was very nice and apologized and informed me that they were running behind but that our driver had already left with our food. He arrived within five minutes so I believed her.  However, the wait was DEFINITELY worth it! We ordered the Angelina's Special pizza (basically a supreme), a dozen traditional buffalo wings, and a cheeseburger for our picky five year old. To start, the cheeseburger was delicious! Our daughter is extremely picky with her food and she ate the entire thing, and this was no small burger, it was one that would keep either my husband or me full! The pizza was so so good and reminded me of better quality Costco pizza. Not too saucy, fresh tasting ingredients, and a beautiful crispy crust. The wings were actually traditional buffalo! They were deep fried and came with a butter/home-made hot sauce mix that was amazing! The food was all so well made and delicious that we will definitely be ordering again. Not to mention the price was great! And they have awesome family meal deals so we know who we will be ordering from when it's football season!!!
4 Great stuff - just ordered the BLT pizza, shrimp scampi pizza, and deep fried mushrooms and they're all fantastic.  I will absolutely order from here again :)
1 used to be Angelina,s which was 5 star parlor but they sold and it becae Angelo,s whuch us horible. So greasy that the bottom of box was drenched with oil and when I called to complain they did not understand English well and it wasn,t because they speak italian-because I do and they did not speak Italian either.  Italians nit naking Italuan food not a good choice to eat at. Went back to Mark Riches with their Tuesday special.
5 Very good pizza.... Really like the flavorful sauce,  the crust was great not to thick just chewy enough...... Will be coming back very soon.....
3 I can't help but long for the days of this establishment as an Angelina's.  I don't know when it changed and I don't know why.  All I know is that it isn't quite as good as it once was.  I ordered a stromboli with pepperoni, spinach and mushrooms.  That is a rather typical order for me.  It was still good but there were some things wrong with it.  First of all, it was hard to cut through as it seemed to be over cooked.  Parts of the bottom had gone beyond golden brown and into the realm of being burnt.  It was dark but it did not have that burnt taste.  Yet.  A few minutes more and it would have.  On the inside was a lot of cheese which I appreciate.  But what it had in cheese it lacked in everything else.  There was pepperoni, spinach and mushrooms as requested but not in the quantities that I was used to receiving from Angelina's.  On the other hand, when I ordered a pizza from here in April and it was Angelo's, the pizza was quite good.  So it hasn't gone completely down the drain when it comes to the food.  As for the inside, there is not much to it.  It is small with only a few tables to sit at.  There are two TVs usally with sports on.  And then there is the music.  Two speakers in the corner last night were blairing some loudness that was starting to irritate me.  It wasn't background music.  It was Genesis and Godsmack with absolutely no bass and far too much trebel.  It sounded tinny and hurt my ears.  Had the sound quality been better or the volume turned down, it would have been alright.  This was just downright unpleasent.  I'm glad I ordered my food to go.  Its just too bad I had to suffer for the 15 to 20 miuntes while my stromboli cooked.   I don't know if or when I will be back.  I get frequent fliers advertising other pizza places near by.  Maybe I'll give them a try next time.
1 We gave this place several chances. The first bad experience was when they claimed it would be 45 minutes to an hour for our delivery. An hour and a half later, our freezing food arrived. We thought next time to just not order on a Friday. So we ordered again, and had to call and check up on the delivery after an hour. Food finally arrived, and one of the drinks was missing. We finally gave it one last shot today, and after an hour and a half, we called, and were promised it would be "any minute." Twenty minutes later, still nothing. I finally called after almost two hours to cancel the order. The driver arrived in the parking lot shortly after, but who would want to eat the freezing food he had with him. Never, ever again. We will be finding somewhere else to order for our office. I put the menu back up in the break room with a note to warn anyone else off.
1 This place is horrible! First of all I ordered food from here and inside was a live bug crawling all over it! So disgusting!!! So I called Angelina's back to let them know and the old lady was so rude to me and was like there's no way there would be a bug in your food container. So I drove all the way back up to the restaurant and showed her the live bug crawling all on my food. All she said was oh wow there really is a bug. So I wanted my money back from there being a disgusting live bug crawling all over my food and for having to drive all the way back up there and for the lady's rudeness towards me. The lady said I would have to call later when the owner is there. So I went back home and called Angelina's (Angelo's) and the lady answered and said the owner was busy and would call me back.. The owner never called me back. So the next day I called and I was able to talk to the owner Sam. He was so rude to me and told me he could not refund my money! I told him how there was a live bug in my food and how unsanitary that is and how his front desk old lady was rude to me and he still did nothing for me. He is a very terrible owner and should be treating his customers kindly. How hard would it have been to refund my 9 bucks to make the customer happy and want to maybe come back after there being live bugs in their food! Sam obviously doesn't know how to run a business because the main thing is THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT! If Sam wants business he should treat his customers better and have a cleaner restaurant!!!!! I would not recommend this place to anyone!!!!!!! I personally don't like live bugs in my food or rude workers or a rude owner!! TERRIBLE SERVICE!
2 While I freely admit I am a tough judge when it comes to pizza, I am sure this is just your average pie.  The bragged about the freshly made dough and sauce, that doesn't mean it had great flavor.  Good value, the toppings very plentiful and tasty but the overall product was nothing special and it took way longer than they said.  I suspect since I called in the order they didn't start making it until I arrived.  What other reason would it take 45 minutes to get a 14" pizza with 2 toppings?  I was hoping to broaden our choices for pizza but only one place remains to be topped.
1 Never patronize this place. Very rude.  Called to place an order for pickup. Was put on hold for over 3 minutes. The person that came on the phone to take my order was very rude and talked over me. When I asked him to not talk over me, he said he wasn't going to take my order and hung up on me. When I called back to speak to a manager, he said he was the owner, he wasn't going to take my order and for me to never call again.  Not a problem. I never will.
1 I would like to review this establishments food, unfortunately I was not given that opportunity.   I got a leaflet menu on my door and after a long day of work decided to give them a call. I got about 1 minute into the call and here is why:   The young lady on the phone refused to exhibit even basic customer service skills. I asked for the #5 Combo Deal. Pizza + Wings + Chicken wings + 2 Liter. Good deal for the money, except I wanted boneless wings, something they readily have available on their menu.  It seemed like a pretty simple substitution but the young lady on the phone just said "Yeah I can't do that." "Why." "Its just the computer I can't do it."   Excuse me? Okay, your computer is set up weird. Talk to your boss, a manager, call your mom, anything.   I offered to pay extra to substitute.   Nope.   The least she could have done is put me on hold and go to talk to a superior and get things worked out. I didn't ask for the impossible or the outrageous, just boneless wings.   I didn't feel respected as a customer so their leaflet is now in the trash and I'm eating some mediocre chain pizza. Sorry Angelo's! I tried to give you my money, but you wouldn't have it. Better luck next time, but there won't be a next time for me.  t
3 After becoming bored with the typical chain pizza, I decided to give Angelo's a try and am glad I did. I ordered the pick up cheese special and added sausage, mushrooms, and sun dried tomatoes and it was very good. The women in the store were friendly and polite, the bathroom was clean, and the ranch dressing cups I ordered on the side were better than most. The reason it's not getting the 5 star rating is because I feel they skimped a bit on the mushrooms - for an extra $1.75 there could have been a lot more on the pizza. But overall, it was good and I will be going back again.
3 Received a flyer in the mail for yet another pizza restaurant.  This time, Angelo's pizza.   We called it in for pick up.  Was ready on time and looked good when we picked it up.  Tasted ok, the cheese and toppings were good but the sauce was just mediocre.  The crust was nice and light.  Overall, just another average pizza.  You can order from any local pizza restaurant and find this type pizza here in Vegas.  Pizza hut still tastes better.
5 I've eaten here for pizza and wings several times. The wings are delicious and the pizza is some of the best. They are always friendly and have great service and I've yet to be disappointed
5 Extensive menu best calzone I've had!! My hubby and I loved it! The gals are nice too!!
4 This place is great!! We ordered pizza for the first time and we loved it!! It is definitely New York style.  We are extremely hard to please when it come to pizza. We will order here again for sure. The only bad thing I can say is the girl I ordered pizza from gave me a hard time about a coupon I had just received  in the mail that day.  She did honor it but it was not the experience I would expect..... For future note it's your coupon ( and it's valid) and I'm buying pizza, honor the $2.50 coupon with out the threats of not taking it next time.
1 Well I really don't know where to begin so here it goes. I ordered over the phone and was going in for the pick up as we don't like the delivery time. As I waited the counter girl asked to ring me up and I said sure. She rang as cash instead of debit, no big deal it would wash at the end of the day. But when she told the owner he was so rude to her and told she would go out short at the end of the day. Which of course is not true, so I asked her is he is the owner and does he always talk and treat you this way? And all three ladies working there hung their heads and agreed Yes !!!! So I asked to speak with him.I told him that I was offended to watch and hear him treat his employee this way and that he really should apologize to her. That's when the owner went off! He told me who the F*** do I think I am and I said I'm a customer that's who and he was totally enraged now yelling get the F*** out of my store, F*** you and just go and F****ing eat your food. I was in shock to see anyone react like this I was shaking. I told him I did not want his food and I wanted a refund, I thought he was going to climb over the counter and kill me! He was really scary!! Finally he told the girl to refund me my money and again told me to go F*** myself and to get the F*** out as he didn't need my business. Needless to say I will not ever be back there again. But be for warned this is a very unprofessional company and I wouldn't trust their food if this is the way he cares for his employees and customers! Mary Irby Las Vegas, NV
