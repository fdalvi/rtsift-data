5 Very nice store with great quality products. We have purchased cheaper baby stuff at the big box places but have then come to stores like this for the good stuff all over again. Take my advice, spend the money right the first time, and you'll save money in the long run. The owners are very friendly as well. We'll go back for sure.
5 Just purchased my bugaboo stroller from this store.  Found products that are usually only available online.  I love this store.  Super cute and great customer service!!!
5 This place is awesome! They have a great selection of strollers and carriers. The store owner is very helpful and knowledgable about everything he has in store. I bought a bunch of accessories for my stroller here. He will let you try the strollers and carriers out and show you how they work. I bought toys here and love them. I recently had my baby's amber teething necklace break (bought it from here) he replaced it no questions asked. This place is where I come for all my baby needs.
5 I love this store! We purchase our son's car seat & a double stroller to accommodate our toddler & baby. They have quality items here, car seats, strollers, cribs, baby & toddler toys. This is not your average baby store, if you want high end quality items for your baby/toddler come check out their selection. Plus the owner is awesome, gives great product knowledge on every item. Above and beyond customer service. As long as I live in town this is defensively my baby/toddler store.
5 Great store, they have the higher end items that are only available online or at the other store that I will not name or patronize in town.  Extremely knowledgeable and friendly staff.  Very fair prices too.  I would reccomend this store anytime and will be back to buy more.
