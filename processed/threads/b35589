5 If you want a sweet treat that is worth the calories these are so worth it!  They are delicious and made with quality ingredients. Every time I pick a favorite flavor they come up with something new and exciting. Perfect for parties, showers, etc but even better for just because!
5 A friend told me about Frosted Frenzy Cupcakes so I decided to give them a call. I ordered 4 dozen or their delicious looking cupcakes and had them delivered to a customer's office as a token of my appreciation for their business. What a hit that turned out to be! The office employees still continue to thank me almost every day. Thanks Frosted Frenzy!
5 Came across Frosted Frenzy at the Celebrity Fight Night Gala in Phoenix last year and wanted to order some the next time I was in town.  Luckily a colleague of mine was in AZ yesterday and ordered an assortment of the cupcakes. Hand made and no preservatives make me feel no shame when I devoured 3 in one sitting. My favorite is the KING, tastes just like a peanut butter and banana sandwich (Elvis Presley's favorite!).  Great choice in cupcakes!
5 I am from the Los Angeles area, I discovered these amazing cupcakes on a business trip and now every time I am back in the area I always must have them!! One of the many great things about the wonderful ladies that make these cupcakes is that they deliver!! In which they were kind enough to make an early morning delivery to my hotel before my return flight home. Not only are these cupcakes a work of art but they taste even better!! My top two favorites are "The King" and "salted carmel". I would highly recommend these to anyone and everyone especially for a party or event in which you would like to impress your guests. A+++++
