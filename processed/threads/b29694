4 Located in the Target/Kohl's shopping center inside Target.
3 For only manning this booth with one employee, the girl behind the counter was doing her best.  I usually find Starbucks to be too sugary if it is not a Pike's Peak coffee or an Americano. On our visit to Target, my sister and I got the Hibiscus Refresher. It was the right amount of sweetness and was very refreshing. Just don't eat the blackberries. They were not so good.
5 I try to visit here once every Friday in order to get my mid-afternoon/evening coffee fix.  I love how nice it is to have a Starbucks inside of Target, let alone have very nice and hard working individuals who are helpful!
