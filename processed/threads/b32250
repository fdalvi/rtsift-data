5 This is a nice rec center. Clean ample parking. A room for kids and teens with pool tables and ping pong tables. They have computer access. A nice fitness center that allows access by the day month or yearly prices. The gym is cool as well. Soon the Hollywood water park will be open. The skate park is big and pretty empty I guess due to the heat or kids don't know it exists. FYI Gym membership is 16 a mo or 4 dollars for a day pass.
4 Gym is ok. Has a cardio area with treadmills, bikes, and ellipticals( not that much). Also have smith machine,  dumbells from 30 - 75lb, bench press, and many more machines. Would recommend to go in the morning because it is packed like a can of sardines from noon and after. Atmosphere in the gym is really comfortable but there will be some people that will be loud as always. Overall its a good place the Gym membership for a month is $15 and $105 for a year I wish they could extend the gym time and make the area bigger.  Ps: they also have an aquatic center perfect for summer!!!
