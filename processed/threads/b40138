5 Swake is my go-to concierge for all the best Vegas promoters!   From Lavo's crazy Party Brunch to splashing around at Daylight Beach Club to VIP table service at Marquee Nightclub, if you're looking to have fun in Vegas, those are just a few of the venues to checkout, and Swake has got you covered.  They're professional, reliable, and I've never had to wait in one of those ridiculously long lines whenever I went through them.  I highly suggest booking shows  through them as well.  They got me into Rose. Rabbit. Lie the new nightclub in Vegas for FREE with drinks and a show before the club!
5 Tina Tang is your girl for the guest list hook ups!! Always a great time! !
5 Best concierge service I've used in Vegas.  Normally I use several promoters throughout my stay and it doesn't always work well since some promoters don't last at the same club for long and some aren't reliable or never meet up with me in person.  With Swake I contact one person and they do the rest!  Every club like Hakkasan or pool party like Encore Beach Club in the summer I want to go to they set me up with a manager or head host that'll be there that day so I'm not stressing about if they're going to come through or not.    Last month I used their service for hotel discounts and was pleasantly surprised they were cheaper than the major sites.    I just finished Magic week here and am so happy I didn't have to stress about these things.  Thanks!
5 Swake is absolutely the go-to company for your Vegas needs. Haven't been to Vegas in a minute and didn't want to, but I got in touch with Swake and they got us some good deals at Hakkasan! Zabrinna (thank you) actually hooked us up and made sure we had everything we need and wanted, she also let us know first hand if she could or couldn't! Very sincere, helpful and genuine. Definitely going back! Next week too hahahahaha!  Calvin Harris and Tiesto here we come! Highly recommend them for your party starters!
5 If you go to Vegas, you NEED to call up Swake Las Vegas, it's absolutely FREE! I just told them who I wanted to see that weekend & they handled the rest. No stressing about what to do in Vegas. I have multiple promoters numbers to different clubs, but some of them are not reliable or RUDE! I mean, you're suppose to be on a mini vacation right? So why stress out about little things like this, when you have Swake do all the work for you. (: All their staffs are friendly & so easy to talk to. Anyways, I met up with Zabrinna the Manager of Swake, she's so bubbly & made me feel like we were friends for years! She walked my friends & i into Surrender to see Diplo for FREE! We didnt have to wait in that ridiculous line. Even my guy friends was given free entrance, how awesome is that?! We were also  given free drink tickets. And by the end of the night I was on stage dancing with diplo! Swake made this all happen, i had such an amazing night!! They also suggested a bunch of places to eat/do/see for the rest of my stay in Vegas. I can't wait for my next visit to Vegas, just so Swake can plan my next trip there! I'm EXCITEDDDDDDDD =D
5 Best promoter in Vegas. We got in to marquee within 5  minutes! With 8 guys! I'm pretty sure that is close to impossible. Our contact was amazing  and she definitely took care of us. Getting us organized and in without a hitch. This made my Vegas trip. I wouldn't choose any other promoter. And will defiantly use them again for my big bday bash!
