5 This is a great little place. Kind if off the beaten path but we'll worth it. The food is great quality and very well priced. Always check the daily specials, everything has been great.
4 Not the most delicious BBQ in the area, but definitely the least expensive. I've had the chicken burrito (added bacon) and the tri-tip burrito. Both were fresh and of decent size. Added a side of garlic bread (tasty, soft and only a dollar) and a slice of chocolate cake (moist, scrumptous and also only a dollar). Needless to say...
4 Quick!  You only have 3 hours a day to enjoy some great BBQ in a very unassuming location.  The hospitality, quality of food, and value is worth the try. Reminds me of the TV series " The Office" if they had a restaurant in their lobby.
1 Friendly staff but Not a fan.  Not sure if food is prepared elsewhere or night before because they microwaved our food.
