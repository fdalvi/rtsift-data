2 As a fast food joint my expectations are not high, but when you give me cool, somewhat soggy onion rings and a cold whopper dang!  I love the onion ring sauce and am convinced they put cocaine in it.  That saved my otherwise lackluster meal.  Also, the drive through was fast.  There, I said something nice.
2 I went in and ordered some Chicken Sandwich's. I got home and looky here I got whopper Jr.'s. I didnt mind as I made it work. But I feel bad for the person who ordered a Whopper Jr. and got a Chicken Sandwich.
2 No sweet potato fries anymore and $2 for a tea? McDonalds here I come! And their regular fries have changed yet again.
1 Tried these losers again, only because my son begged me. Maria rang up my egg & cheese croissant breakfast meal....$8.91.....really? When I questioned the amount, she told me it was right and showed me the cash register. Well, you can't fix STUPID! We left, unfed.
