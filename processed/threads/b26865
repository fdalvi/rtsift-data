4 Hooray!! This place saved the day!! My toddler needed a treat and they always deliver!! They have the best cookies ever. Love this place. They even have some amazing looking drinks..didn't dare try one but they sure look yummy. I know we loved our chocolate chip cookies!! Yummy!!
4 Well I finally gave in and tried one of the drinks. It was a tollhouse cookie drink. Yep I went there. Cookies in a cup. Brilliant. Sooo yummy. I enjoyed every slurp of it. Dont even wanna know how many calories were in that!
5 I really love their s'mores cookies! Tastes so delicious! I also tried the peanut butter and white chocolate macadamia cookies, they were also good. The guy who helped me was very polite and helpful.
