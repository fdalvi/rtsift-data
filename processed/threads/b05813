2 It's no different than any other Burger King I've been to except they can never seem to get my order right in the drive thru. I just don't bother with this location anymore.  The burgers are fine just probably not the burger you ordered, have the wrong size, wrong flavor of soda...you get the idea.
1 As usual Burger King is out of ketchup!! I wish I could give it some negative stars. The worst thing is that I've been to at least four other burger king's and have had the same problem with the ketchup, but I guess that's not as bad as the time when they ran outta buns!! You run a burger joint; how are you going to run out of the two essential things to run a burger joint?! Plus the bun is always two sizes too big for the patty. Just have sloppy made burgers. Worst chain ever!!!!
4 Normally I dont expect much at a fast food joint but last night I went and the serives was way above par. Food was nice and fresh and I didnt have to get them to make my food over for my special burger. Was pleasantly surprised.
