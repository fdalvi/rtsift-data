5 AM Realty was the property manager for a home I rented for 3 years in Las Vegas NV. It gives me great pleasure to highly recommend AM Realty. Tammy and her team were extremely fair and addressed all issues in a timely manner. AM Realty gave us a number of ways to reach them which is generous in those 'melt down moments'. They didn't provide us with a number for us only to call and talk to a machine.   She wasn't only concerned with pleasing her client (the home owner) but made us feel as if she was equally concerned with our (the renters) satisfaction as well.   Am Realty is extremely knowledgable of the real estate market and property management laws which we felt was beneficial when negotiating our lease, moving in and moving out.   From a renters point of view I would gladly rent again from AM Realty.   From a previous home owner, I wish I would have used AM Realty in manging our rental homes. It would have made for such a more enjoyable experiance.
5 Words can't describe how grateful we are to have worked with AM Realty. Tammy and her team are just awesome. If you need to sell, rent or own, AM Realty is the place to look up and go with. Friendly, professional, knowledgeable and easy to work with, We can't think of anyone else we recommend to family or friends. Thanks Tammy and AM Realty for making our short sale easy and fast!
5 AM Realty is a team of true professionals. They understand urgency and their work is outstanding. AM Realty was in charge of renting my home as my property management company and I have NO COMPLAINTS whatsoever; they are truly one of a kind.  AM Realty was also trusted to sell my home and during that process they also exceeded my expectations. Great company, amazing team!
5 What a an extremly wonderful group of people, professional, kind and "on-it" at all times. I cannot say enough about the care that Tammy and Marisa give to all aspects of the business.  As a renter and new to the Las Vegas area, both of them were extremly helpful and went out of there way to make sure everything was perfect.  In working the AM Realty, as a renter and as a home owner , you are treated with respect.  I would highly recommend working with Tammy and her group for all of your property needs!!!
