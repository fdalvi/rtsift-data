5 I love Holyrood Park, which is one of the reasons why I moved to this area of Edinburgh. It has a bit of everything: the road for biking or running, trails criss-crossing hilly expanses, beautiful lakes, old ruins, gorgeous views of both the city and the sea, and of course the famed Arthur's Seat and Salisbury Crags. As a word of warning to those who haven't been yet, it sure is hilly and will get you in shape quickly! When running clockwise around the road, the uphill is steep and considerably short, as compared to going the other way around where the uphill is still nothing to laugh at and is less steep but still 1.5k of climbing. The whole way round is 5k, and there are many race events that take advantage of this scenic and challenging space.   Of course Arthur's Seat is most people's main destination in Holyrood Park, which is gorgeous and has great views. I am also particularly fond of the Salisbury Crags which are incredibly easy to access during a quick trip to the park. You get a 'big bang for your buck' and are quickly rewarded with fabulous views of the city without much climbing. It's also a perfect place for a romantic summer evening's stroll.  In short, Holyrood Park is such a beautiful area to explore, and what a treat it is to have it on the door step of the city centre!
5 Absolutely gorgeous and worth your time. I'm not a "nature person" or a "hiker," but I found the strenuous hike up to the top to be full of rewarding and stunning views. There's not much of a set trail, so you can pretty much mosey up the hill/mountain at your own pace. You can go off the heavily trafficked path and take a nap or rest on a lovely, thick bed of wild grasses with the river to your right and rolling hills all around. Every city needs a Holyrood Park!
