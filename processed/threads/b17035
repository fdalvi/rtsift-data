5 We had a wonderful experience at the Spa at Caesars.  The hot Mineral pools were divine.  After all the walking we did in Vegas, a few hours at the spa, was just the remedy to revive our weary selves!  The most intriguing room , a cool down room, where  snow falls gently, snow with moisturizers, in fact. The $45 entrance fee was well worth it.  Teas, and juices, bottled waters and snacks were available at no extra charge.  The Spa was beautiful, peaceful, and squeaky clean.  We will be back!
