5 3 things I would like to thank Mac for:  1) Being the best make-up a girl can ever have  2) This location having the friendliest/most persuasive staff that always twists my arm into making purchases that I don't feel guilty about when I get home  3) Making sure that no one calls out the dogs on me or that I scare off any men when I hit the club....wait....sometimes those two are one in the same...oh well...
1 I just have to say that I find this MAC location very lacking in customer service and knowledge of their products. As a MUA I am always in the know of new products and lines, especially by name brands such as MAC. I went last week in to see when they would launch the new Indulge collection and the girl did not even know what I was talking about. Ok, understandable. The manager informed me it was launching in stores next Thursday.   Today, on the day of the launch, I went as soon as Macy's opened. 10am. When I got to the MAC counter there was no one in sight. I waited and waited. After about 10 to 15 minutes a nice woman from the Estee Lauder counter came and assisted me as much as she could. Since there was no display for the new fall collection, it was hopeless. So she told me she was going to check in the back where the girls were at to see if they could assist me. Before going to the back she asked the cosmetics department manager and the manager said they were not getting that shipment.   First, they weren't knowledgable about their own lines. Second, it is very unprofessional how they weren't even available at the open of the store! Third, they are not even up to date on their own products like every other MAC store!   Thank Goodness for fashion show! They were prepared as expected.
1 Im so mad! Went in purchased a few items and had 6 disposable in exchange for a lipstick. She put the wrong lipstick (ruby woo )which I already have! I did not notice until I wanted to use my new lipstick. Went in today and tried to exchange the lipstick for the correct one and was denied! This location needs to be more organized with their customers products! I will not recommended this location to anyone!!!!!
2 On several occasions I have came to this counter and they did not have my products in stock. Not only that, I can COMPLETELY agree with a previous post that the MUA do not know much about their products. It really is such a dissapointment considering MAC has an outstanding reputation in the makeup industry therefor it is sad when these employees fail to show their skills on themselves and any clients coming in.  I am from Los Angeles and I am so used to going into any MAC store or counter that is well stocked, well informed and knowledgable about their products, and the MUA always looking fantastic.  I am giving two stars because this isn't the worst MAC counter I have encountered. It does seem clean and I have seen MUA santizing products. I have been approached (not greeted) but I have experienced their customer service and it truly only does lack knowledge about products and skills to be used with their products. But, to any makeup junkie like myself that can be a really big deal.  It is very small and can get a little overcrowded at times (during weekends)  Dont remember any MUA names and *Also they accept your empty containers but only in exchange for a lipstick.  Venetian MAC store will give you a lipstick, eyeshadow, or lipgloss.
