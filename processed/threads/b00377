5 I stayed at the Hotel San Carlos and they are partnered with this gym. It's a block away from the hotel. Well equipt gym. I was able to have an excellent workout.
4 nothing flashy - just a comfortable fitness environment with generally well maintained equipment and facilities.
5 Love this gym.  Very casual and comfortable and the locker rooms are well maintained and tidy.  A great way to spend my lunch hour.
