5 The best way to end a 4 day trip to Vegas is a pedicure & manicure. My friend and I couldnt wait to get to the McCarren Airport so we arrived super early to give us enough time to relax. We were promptly greeted and was escorted to one of their many massage chairs. After relaxing for a few moments, Veronica began my pedicure. Now....ladies...after 3 days of walking around in flip-flops and then high heels/stilettos all night..our feet are tired..right? Veronica was the best...she made me feel comfortable and after informing her that I was diabetic, she was very gentle with my feet. Great experience!  My friend and I left Xpress Spa totally relaxed and ready to fly back home. Thank you Xpress Spa!!
5 Amazing... I had too much time to kill before my flight and got tired of eating bad food and perusing the magazine racks and wandering into xpress spa.  Great menu with lots of travel friendly options (like massages in 15, 30, 45, and 60 min increments).  I got a 45 min massage and it was perfect.  She didn't get lotion in my hair and I didn't feel greasy/yucky on the flight home.  Nice ending to my trip.
4 Good relaxing massage. Pricey but it is in an airport in Vegas. $55 for 1/2 hour, neck, shoulder and back. You can get shorter or longer ones and even foot massages. Always wanted to try this place and glad I did.   Workers are pretty nice answered any questions I had. My masseuse Patricia was very good, loosened up my stiff neck and shoulders.
