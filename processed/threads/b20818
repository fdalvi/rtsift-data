4 preiswertes Hotel mit sehr guter Busanbindung zur City (ohne Umsteigen), sehr freundlicher Service, trotz Autobahnn√§he relativ ruhig.
2 The building looks nice from a distance but the yellow nicotine looking net curtains should have been a give away as to what lurked inside. A 90's looking dated reception & rooms with airfreshner thick in the air. But as long as the beds okay, its only for one night... Okay, well lets say theres less bounce on my sons trampoline than this bed thats probably seen thousands softening it! Im a regular at Travelodge and always give good reviews, but this one is a place to be avoided if your budget will allow!
