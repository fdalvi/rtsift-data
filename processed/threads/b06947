1 Good selection of merchandise. Some fairly talented staff, although heavy on attitude. Customer service after the sale was a complete disaster. Found management to be either absent or unwilling to resolve problems.
5 Very helpful, no pressure sales people. They listened to me, and helped me find a product that fit what I was looking for. In fact, I actually picked up a much larger product than I intended to purchase, not only because it was higher quality than what competitors were offering, it was also priced competitively. In the process of purchasing the one piece of furniture, I saw another item that we had been considering, but had not at all planned on purchasing so soon. The salesperson didn't bring it to my attention (because I hadn't asked), but once I expressed interest, he was as helpful and friendly as he'd been before... no pressure whatsoever. When salespeople listen and help, and they are interested in satisfying customers, versus trying to upgrade and add on beyond the expressed budget, it means when I do have $1600 to spend on a sofa, living room or bedroom set, I'll be going back to the place that treated me just as well when I only had a few bucks to spend, relative to the pricing on most of their other products. Sales is not always about getting the biggest bang for your buck as the salesperson, but investing in customer relations, listening and adhering to one's budget, treating the customer well, no pressure, no gaming, just straightforward. The individual I worked with has ensured that I will return the next time we are in the market for furniture. The other places I shopped probably won't see me again.
5 ... the sales guy in the recliner department, is hands-down, the best salesman I've ever encountered.  I don't remember his name, it was the beginning of last month, went in there to help my elderly disabled mother select a new recliner, my little brother was along as well.  This guy had us laughing, and fully participating in the sale banter, even though all 3 of us have very little patience for salespeople in general.  Have to hand it to this guy, who ever he is ... he has a bright future in whatever he does, while he is really really good at Lazy Boy recliner sales, I do believe he has a brighter future in whatever he chooses to do moving forward.    He really sealed the deal when he started to flip over the chair, showed us the hardware underneath, made fun of the 'other brands' there, physically 'thrashing' the other brands shakin' 'em around showing their feebleness vs. Lazy Boy, this guy knew the Lazy Boy history down pat, and paired it with all sorts of bouncing around on the chair, showing us its 'hardiness', features ... I had tears in my eyes I was laughing so hard.  Brilliant.  We bought the warranty ... even though we rarely do that ... it is a rare day that i'll go out of my way to tell a salesperson, 'nice work'.  The Lazy Boy salesman at Steinhafels, even if you don't need a chair, just pretend you want one, then kick back and watch the show ... you'll want to buy one once 'mr lazy boy' does his thing ...
5 Bought three separate things shortly after moving here and had all good experiences. I shopped at three different mattress stores all on the same street and this had the best mattress for a reasonable price. The salespeople weren't pushy and annoying, but were helpful when I needed help. The mattress was delivered promptly and they were careful walking through the house with it.  I picked up a dresser and a table from the store to assemble and both look great. The dresser had a slight problem with one drawer but steinhafels sent me an email the day I got it saying if I had any problems to fill out a form and they'd come fix it (no cost to me). I took them up on it and the guy came and fixed it quickly and was friendly and competent.
4 Since moving to Madison several years ago we have bought quite a bit of furniture, most from Steinhafels, some from other places.  We have been very satisfied with the sales people at the store (we bought from the location along the beltline).  We were looking at a sectional, and the salesman advised us that one of their biggest sales would be coming up in a couple of months.  As promised, he called us as soon as the sale started to let us know the lower price was available.  Excellent follow-up!  Why not five stars?  For service I do give five stars.  However, not all of the furniture can be considered high-quality merchandise, which in all fairness one would expect at this price point.  With a teen, we often buy extended warranties, and we needed to exercise warranty claims both for our sectional as well as a queen bed.  Steinhafels offers extended warranties through Guardsman.  When we filed our first claim I did some internet research on Guardsman and read a lot of horror stories, but in our experience Guardsman's service was excellent, despite a somewhat convoluted claims filing process.  We will buy from Steinhafels again!
4 So day one - Steinhafel's.  The manager, in an eye burning yellow shirt, asked me if I needed help.  I told him what I wanted.  We looked.  I found a sofa I liked but it was just out of my price range.  I explained that to the manager and instead of taking any other normal approach, he invaded my personal space by learning in abnormally close to me.  It was weird and in a very menacing manner, explained to me that this sale was only happening today and I needed to act.  He would not be responsible for  me losing the great sale.  Fine, make a sale, but do not creep me out while doing it.  Also, why so abrasive?  Gross.  Please change your shirt, you look like Dwight.  Day two - I really liked that couch so I went back the next day and then there was Bob!. Love him. He sat me down and priced out my couch.  Wow.  What a thought?  Just sit down and talk with me.  He gave me my options worked with my budget and length restriction.  Thank you Bob.  You manged to get Steinhafel's 5 stars and only lose one star for the manager with no boundries who is probably your boss.  Note: I have not purchased the sofa yet.  It was late and I am going back when Bob is there this weekend.  So there may be more to this story or at least  a name for the manager.
4 We headed to Steinhafels as a reward for 3 days of intense patio building - patio furniture, here we come!  The 4th of July sale offered a number of nice sets for decent prices.  This was a definite plus - you could get something quite fancy ($1000+) or much more moderately priced ($300+) and they seemed to have a larger selection than what we'd seen at other chain stores.   We worked with Jordan who was casual and informative, just how I like my salespeople.  He was not pushy, he just sat with us and had a frank conversation about the pros/cons of different sets.  The set we wanted was not in-stock so we had to wait until the next day for it to come from the warehouse.  As promised, it arrived on time and was fairly easy to assemble (easy for me to say, I just supervised).  All in all I would certainly check them out again for future furniture needs - especially during sale season!
1 Do Not Shop Or Buy Furniture Here. Spent over $10,000.00 on three bedrooms and living room. After they have your money it is impossible to get customer service. Management is unwilling to listen, and customer service people are condescending and rude. Even after waiting three weeks for furniture it is difficult to get acceptable delivery date. Go anywhere else for furniture but Steinhafels.

1 Horrible Experience!  Wrote a review yesterday, and somehow it was taken down. Do Not Shop Here!  Will keep posting Every Day if review is taken down. Terrible Service!

2 The tables we bought from Steinhafels are nice, but we were pregnant when we bought them and now have a toddler.  Knowing that, we purchased the furniture warranty they offered because they described it as simple - Call and they send someone out.  Cool! Well, now we have requested service from the warranty company and it has been hoop after hoop of jumping, no push-button simple here. I am becoming more and more convinced we were sold a bill of goods on the warranty by Steinhafels and will never get the service we paid for. Called Steinhafels customer service about it and they played the third party provider card.  Very nice!
5 I'm told they are expensive and there are other places that are better, but both times I've been there, I got great deals and left very happy.  No complaints.  I'll return there first when I need something else.  Look for the deals...they are there!
4 Buying a couch is a difficult task.  You sit.  And sit. Sit some more. Sit a little longer.  Then sit some more.  Put your feet up, that's fine.  I was impressed with the large selection Steinhafels offers in their showroom.  So many couches to sit on.  Even working TVs to watch while you try them out!  So many different styles and prices of couches, mattresses, and other living space accessories to choose from.  Even better was our no-nonsense salesman who offered us a great deal on a showroom display couch.    The delivery was great.  They offer a real-time tracking app for their delivery drivers so you know exactly when they will arrive.  They will also move existing furniture in your house if necessary to accommodate your new purchase.    I was pleased with my experience here.  I would shop again,
