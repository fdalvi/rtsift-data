5 We grew tired of pool services that would never show up, overcharged, and usually didn't do that great of a job anyways. So we were pleasantly surprised once we switched to Premier Pool Care! This is a company that provides exceptional customer service, always arrives on time, and does an outstanding job of keeping our pool clean and running worry free. I will continue to highly recommend them to everyone I know.
1 Premier Pool Care provides the worst pool service in the Phoenix area.  First, they let our pool go green.  Then after restoring the pool after weeks of harassement, they let it go green again.  We paid them for monthly service, so the pool should never go green... ever.  The last month we paid was for service in August.  They told us they wouldn't service the pool, and the month wasn't even up.  Now they won't return our calls.  They should change their name from Premier Pool Service to Green Pool Service because that's the color your pool will be when they are through with you.
1 We hired premier pool care about a year ago. They were great they showed up on time, and cleaned our pool spotless. Then we had a table fall in our pool during a dust storm and I called them and asked them to call us back because I needed to know how to handle this situation and get the glass out. They never returned my call. Then 2 weeks ago they just stopped coming to our house. I called and left many messages, but they don't return my calls. I wrote them an email with of course no response. I have no idea what happend but they left us high and dry with no reason. I would suggest not going with this company. They will fool you at first and seem reliable and friendly but then just one day they leave you with a dirty pool and no way of getting a hold of them. Don't use this company!
