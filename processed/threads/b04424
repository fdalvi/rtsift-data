2 Nice people, BUT.  Bad report. Missed - literally Missed many things.  Whole experience weird in comparison to other places.  Report and whole process of report questioned by a doctor.  Took Much longer to get report results than initially told, and repeated calls to facility by myself and Several doctors.  Honestly, just not a good experience.  Would not go back.
1 If they had negative stars that is what I would give them. My son had an MRI there on a Saturday it is now the end of the day on Thursday and still no results. My doctors office has called several times and they keep telling them they are working on the report. What are they doing, writing a novel. If you want results , go someplace else!
5 I went here for a pre-surgical chest X-ray in January. I was a walk-in and expected a long wait. To my surprise the wait was minimal, my insurance was processed in minutes, and the report was in my doctor's hands the next morning.   This facility is clean, has a spacious lobby, friendly well humored staff, and great parking.
1 What a joke. It took three weeks from my dr. sending them an order until they scheduled me. I had to call several times because they couldn't figure out their schedule. The night before my appt they call and tell me they are over extended and can't see me at my scheduled time and are doing their best to accommodate me. I scheduled a weeks worth of meetings around this so I could get there at the time I scheduled and they bump me because of poor planning on their part. Thanks for wasting my time. If I can't trust that you can make and keep and appointment I certainly do not trust you to complete a medical test. I will take my business elsewhere.
