1 Spent 70 dollars and a mediocre pedicure and the WORST set of full nails I've ever gotten.  Within days they were lifting, and I had to go somewhere else to get a new set.  I will NEVER return or refer anyone to your establishment.
5 This store is the only Nail salon I will ever go too. Tim has been doing my nails for over 3 years now and his wife Kim is amazing too! They know how to take care of their customers and are vary professional. I love this place!
4 On the hunt for a go to nail shop. They have tons of gel nail colors and on the swatches they have the brand so if you are picky about that or looking for a specific color it would make it easier to find.  Good solid basic pedi. They have everything clearly listed on what you get. I would go back. Reasonable prices, $18 pedi, $20 gel mani
1 I can't comment on the actual services because we ended up walking out after waiting over an hour for a pedicure that was said to be only a 15 minute wait. In the hour we were there, not one person was finished and four people still sat waiting in the chairs to have a nail tech even come over.   Sorry, there are too many other nail places around. We will never come back again.
