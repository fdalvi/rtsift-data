5 I see Dr Clark and Dr Corcoran here as my primary physicians and have since high school. They're both very efficient and warm people - ideal doctors.  It's an older neighborhood near their office so I'm usually a LOT younger than the patients waiting, but besides that its a normal great office!
5 I see Dr. Corcoran. This is the only doctor I have who does not rush you out! He will listen and work hard to find a answer for you. The office may be a bit slow sometimes, but I KNOW bad doctors.... He is worth the wait! He is easy to talk to too. For some reason I don't get the "stink-eye" from him. Great feeling to be believed and offered help.
1 The staff at this clinic are HORRIBLE. The receptionists ignore you. Dr. Clark's assistant did not wash her hands or wear gloves when giving me a shot. She even tried to wipe the blood away without protecting herself or me. Dr. Clark appears to be competent but basically he just sends you out to specialists since he can never see you when you are actually sick.
1 While dr Corcoran is nice and comforting getting into see one of the doctors is virtually impossible. I have never been able to get in to see a doctor or physicians assistant within48 hours and when you are sick that's essential.  Additionally the staff there act as if they are doing you a favor by taking your money. I have never witnessed such nonchalant behavior at a doctors office. Ridiculous
