3 Love torrid but just wish their prices were cheaper!!! But when they have sale items..they are affordable :) the staff at this location are always friendly and upbeat girls!
1 Seriously, this is such an awesome store, however the store manager is just awful!  Go to Meadow's instead.
4 This one is tough to rate. About 85% of the clothes in my closet, and a good amount of shoes have come from Torrid. I love what they have for plus size women, but it is SUPER expensive.   On average you'll spend around $40 bucks for a top and $40-$70 for a bottom. Sign up for Diva Style and you'll get 5% off once you reach Diva Status, which helps a little. Clearance goes on 50% off sale about every other month, and they have sales in between.  If you're on a budget, try Fashion Bug or Rainbow. If not, Torrid can be a great choice.
4 The clothes are EXTREMELY over priced, but the girls who work here are ALWAYS sweet and helpful. They're just a little pushy when it comes to buying things. I feel like if I don't like something I've tried on, I have to hurry to get dressed and then run out of the store! Other then that, though, it's a great store!
