3 Very nice staff and clean restaurant. The wait time can be a little long sometimes. The food is hit or miss. It's either fresh and great or old and dry. Just depends on your timing. Prices have steadily been rising, but I guess that's to be expected in today's day and age.
3 It was pretty cool. Service was nice and fast but my chow mein was pretty dry and the beef and broccoli just didn't taste like beef and broccoli. Giving it 3 stars because the orange chicken was awesome :)
2 Hot or miss food today got my order wrong and barely got any food so that always cool
5 Couldn't have had a better experience  the place was clean from top to bottom  . I was greeted immediately smiles all around . I was served fast   . Food was hot and fresh   drinks weren't watered down  tables were clean and staff didn't seem to have down time   , they were busy cleaning  and sweeping    highly recommended
3 Usually I despise all Panda Express locations...but not eating them for a long while, my meal was actually pretty good! They get 3 stars because the girl that was the cashier was on a personal call while I paid discussing how she didn't know what the hell was going on because they screwed up her check lol she never said a word to me as I paid.
2 This location is clean and new, but I found the staff unhelpful and the options lacking. As a vegetarian I was very disappointed to find that none of the entrees are vegetarian (I've had eggplant tofu or country style bean curd at other locations). My only options were chow mein, rice, steamed veggies, egg rolls and cream cheese wantons. Even a single vegetarian option would be great!
