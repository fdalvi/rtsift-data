5 Decided to stop by Rubinov's today, and very grateful I did! I am not a fan of purchasing shaving supplies online, as I cannot smell, touch, of see the product. So I have been going to Art of Shaving due to the lack of a brick and mortar shaving supplies here in the valley. Rubinov's has a selection that's atleast 3 times the size and its not all one brand!! Many high end English, German, French, and Italian products (Proraso, GEO, Jack Black, etc..), some for less than I was buying the Art of Shaving stuff for! They are very knowledgeable and friendly and are never pushy with their sales. On top of great service and selection it's nice to support a local family business, that doesn't have to charge outrageous prices to pay their high Scottsdale Mall rent!
5 May 7 2014 - I purchased a 5.3 oz jar of Taylor of Old Bond Street, Lavender scent, shaving cream because I was explained differences between brands, ingredients, and other factors by staff. I was shown product of different scents and allowed to smell the differences. I was able to make a decision as a consumer because of the detailed explanation of product ingredient differences and reasons behind price differences. Patience with me being new to DE shaving was very much appreciated. My questions were answered completely. I use Crystal brand stainless steel double edge blades since November 2013.They are sharp enough for me! Rubinov's is a pleasure to purchase supplies from.
1 RUDE ASS immigrants with no people skills work here! Don't bother going here cause they aren't much help. And everything in their little shop you can get anywhere else for ALOT cheaper!!
