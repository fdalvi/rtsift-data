4 A nice (unassuming) place to throw a few bowling balls and drink beers with your friends.  It's not the embodiment of the latest in bowling technology, but who cares? The food is greasy, the beer is cold, and it's your turn -- let's see what ya got!  Also, the fact that this is the only alley in town that has helped me procure balls for Mondo Croquet (http://twurl.nl/gqx3il) easily outweighs their lack of cutting edge scoring systems.
3 Got invited here by a few friends the other night. It's primarily a softball/volleyball/recreational center, although I spent my time inside in the bar.  The bar area is massive and includes a stage and dance floor. When I inquired as to whether there were ever any bands, I was told that they only do karaoke every so often. Seems like a waste of a nice entertainment area.  Very limited taps; most beverages are served in bottles and cans. Prices are super cheap; tall boys of most anything run in the $2.25 - $2.50 range.  Very limited menu; only a few easy-to-prepare items.  Best suited for grabbing a cold one after a game of softball than as a destination point.   The bartenders were friendly and super fast - a bonus in my book. Thanks to Gretchen & Staci for the excellent service.
4 I've been playing softball at Bowling Green for, well, let's just say "a long time".  While it's not a modern athletic facility, it's got a niche market.  If you enjoy playing ball, having a cold beer, and having fun with some friends - this is a good place for a league.  The umpires are excellent - I've known a few for many years and they do a great job.    The fields are smaller, but "good bats" are limited, keeping home runs down a little (but it feels good to get one - it still goes plenty far!).  I hope they stick around for a long time - I love playing there on Tuesday nights.
