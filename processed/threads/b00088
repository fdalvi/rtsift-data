4 This is take out only.  They have at least two locations that I am aware of.  One in Sun Prairie and one in Fitchburg.  They have excellent Chinese food and the prices are pretty good.
5 Best chinese I've found so far. Hot and sour soup and their won ton soup are fantastic. Sometimes I'll go and just get the soup.
4 I haven't had better Crab Rangoon than they serve here.  The people who work there are pretty nice, too.
5 The general tso's and boneless spare ribs are about as good as you'll find. No lie!
2 Meh. It's okay when you want something quick. Not overly impressed. Fried rice is good.
2 Pretty bland for Chinese take out.
2 We used to go here for our Americanized Chinese food every so often for the last 7 years.  However, in the last year the quality of their food has taken a nose dive to unacceptable levels of blech and blah.
1 The rice and steamed vegetables were good, but that's about all we could tolerate. We ordered General Tso's, which is what we always get when we first try a Chinese restaurant. It helps us compare to other places.The quality of the chicken used was awful. The dumplings were flavorless. We will not be returning.
