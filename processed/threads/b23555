5 Solutions Specialties is AMAZING! Super friendly small-town feel, extremely knowledgeable staff, and they are 100% accommodating in working with other pharmacies when I'm on tour. I wouldn't go anywhere else in the greater Las Vegas area!
5 These guys are awesome!  They are super knowledgeable, cater to your pharmacological needs, and even provide services through the mail if you need it.  Aside from compounding special medications, they also have a plethora of herbal and over the counter products to peruse through right when you walk in.  The staff is super friendly and inviting and always willing to help.  They do take lunch from 1230p-1p so make sure to avoid those times if you are going down to do business with these guys.  Awesome pharmacy!
5 The staff here is AMAZING!  I was able to get my prescription transferred rom Texas and filled in a matter of minutes! Everyone there is knowledgable, friendly and helpful! In addition, the costs are lower than I usually pay elsewhere so that was just an added bonus!! So glad to have found them.
