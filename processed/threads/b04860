3 Is being addicted to party supplies so wrong? I guess is better than being addicted to crack! Hahaha! So, where do I get my fix - Party City!  I love that they everything for almost every kind of party. Everything from adult to child, summer to Christmas, Halloween to fiesta style, they will have what you need. Everything is priced very reasonably and you can be in and out in no time.  They also had a great selection of costumes for Halloween this year with a very good return policy. You can return your costume for 100% refund until Oct 24th.   So, next time you have a hair raising shin-dig make sure to deck yourself and your place up first by getting hooked up at your local Party City!
4 Came here to pick up a few supplies for my little boys 2nd Bday @ Disneyland. The sales people were very helpful and showed me to the Disney section and it was filled with alot of great things. I was amazed at the amount of Mickey Mouse themed items they had. I picked up  a few things and plan on coming back when I throw his actual party back in town.
4 You need party supplies?  More likely than not, you can find it here.  They have a wide selection of balloons.  They have themed sections, you can can easily buy a number of items.  I like making my own goodie bags, so the wide variety of candy on the cheap is good.
4 Dr Seuss celebrates his birthday and this Friday the student's at my daughters school are wearing costumes or anything related to their favorite character.  I went here to check out the Dr. Seuss section which didn't have a lot to choose from.  I had looked at a few stores before coming here and couldn't find anything with the Big Cat on it, so I ended up buying this big Dr. Seuss Birthday hat and cool shades and a red bow tie for my daughter.  I am just going to have her wear red and we will be set!  I did spend longer in the store than I had planned walking aisle and aisle.  What a great selection that have on everything.  While I was there I picked up lots of things that were green for my families holiday - St. Patrick's day!    The staff were very helpful.
3 I've stopped into this store twice now and I can say two things that stood out to me; 1. It's pretty spendy 2. They really don't have a wide variety. The staff is a constant pleasure to be around but with the prices, it's not always worth it.   For instance to blow up 6 balloons that I brought from home for my husbands birthday *12" balloons, helium grade* it cost me $8. That's pretty ridiculous. Also I am in the middle of planning a baby shower and upon looking around I didn't see much for baby showers.   It's a cute store, fun to walk around and look but other than that, not my cup of tea.
3 I love all of the supplies in this place and once again, completely lost my mind when showing for my daughter's Tinker Bell party.  Here in lies the problem, the person blowing up the $20 four foot tall Tinker Bell balloon did a poor job.  She did not fill Tinker's body well.  I bought the balloon at 7 pm Friday night.  By 10 am the next morning, poor Tinker was doubled over.  Her wings were filled well and still floated up, but with Tinker looking at her belly, the balloon did not have the same effect for the party.  Boo!
5 One stop shop for your party needs. Prices are reasonable. Busy place so expect delays in line.
1 I didn't think it was possible to be treated with such disrespect, but this place did it. It took four minutes to get greeted. They were eating doughnuts, just standing there.  at then I got yelled at by both the associates and manager for confronting them about their lack of customer service. The manager was totally disrespectful and rude. The man needed anger management and customer service skills. He threw my stuff at me.
