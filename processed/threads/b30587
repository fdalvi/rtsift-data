5 It is places like this that make it impossible to be healthy........ especially when you walk past the tempting displays they ALWAYS have in the window......... please..... I have no will power, it is just cruel!    It may well be cruel, but my oh my is it soooo worth it! I decided to nip here with a friend as it was her birthday and I hadn't had time to whip a cake-y delight myself. We decided to go for two cupcakes each, which came to a total of £6 I think it was, which I find totally reasonable. After spending several ummm-ing and aaaahhh-ing I went for a banoffee and oreo cookies.   These cupcakes are to DIE for! I usually find cupcakes too dry, not particularly flavoursome and the icing is sickly sweet.... but these, they are so full of flavour and faaar from being dry! They do appear like they have alot of icing, which is usually not my thing, but they totally make the cake!  Needless to say, I have been back and had a mocha cupcake (one of the flavours of the day, which is a brilliant idea!) and white chocolate and vanilla, and they were just as good second time round!   Based on my first visit I would have gone for 4 stars, as there is nowhere to sit and eat them, and they don't do hot drinks... just cupcakes. But I have grown to accept that for what it is, this place cannot be beaten!
4 I'm a big Bibi's fan. It probably didn't help that I spread the word prior to the shop opening about Bibi's doing GF cupcakes before they could source the right ingredients (sorry!) but I knew they would after visiting the St Andrews branch.  I love Bibi's and if I'm in town, I stop and stare dreamily into the window at the cake porn. Their window displays are divine and I would defy anyone to try to resist. I often buy cakes if I'm visiting friends as they do normal (evil for me) and on a saturday, Gluten Free cakes.   Usually they have a huge selection of cupcakes of all flavours - vanilla, chocolate, After Eight, Chocolate Orange, Banoffee, Smarties and many more. The GF versions are more limited and there is a tendancy to make the chocolate sponge version with After Eight, Chocolate or Chocolate Orange. Sometimes though (and these are my favourite weeks) they do vanilla GF cupcakes with lots of girly icing and sparkly sugar crystals - just the way girly cupcakes should be so take note Bibi's (more of these Saturdays please!). On Sundays, GF brownies are available (even with brownie fatigue, the peanut butter brownie is awesome!). The macaroons - georgeous little chewy pastel globes, are so pretty and tasty too.  Cupcakes are usually priced I think under the £2 mark (around £1.75?) and I don't think there is any distinction in price between the evil (normal) and the GF versions so Bibi is applauded by this GF girl. Birthday cakes are available - including GF versions too :-)
1 The worst cupcake place ever.  I specifically asked the employee if the scone cupcake was sweet and the employee said it was not too sweet.  I don't think I ever had such a sweet cupcake in my life! It was so nasty that I felt like vomiting and it left this horrible after taste in my mouth. Even the obese Americans have better quality cupcake places.  Sorry but your cupcakes taste terrible!  On top of that the place had no plastic forks.  How in the world is someone suppose to indulge in a giant cupcake without a fork?  Worst experience.
4 Yummm just thinking about this place makes me drool.. do not dare pass here if you are on a diet! I love their selection (although it doesn't change too often, i think this place could push it a bit more with some more out-there flavours!) but they are beautiful & taste amazing, very fresh! Prices seem to have gone up as this place is getting more popular, but I suppose if cost of ingredients is going up too this is going to be no surprise. A gorgeous little shop with lovely decoration, defiantly worth a look in!
4 I got the chocolate cheesecake cupcake and it was pretty good!  Very moist with cheese in the center
3 I *love* the concept of Bibi's.  I love cupcakes, and love them even more when they're interesting flavours and prettily decorated.  For the size, I also think that the price of the cupcakes is pretty reasonable.  The downside... I'm into my baking so I'm really picky, and I find the cupcakes here really dense, and the (huge amount of) frosting sickly sweet.  Basically, they're prettier than they are tasty.     The macarons are also lovely, and in my limited experience of macarons, the flavours are great.  But, £1.95 for one?  That seems steep, especially as the only other macarons I've had have been £0.95.  So, great location and lovely offerings but with so much other fantastic competition in the cupcake world, Bibi's isn't too high on my *love* list.
5 After Eight cupcakes are to die for!
4 Bibi's prides itself on not only having pretty-looking and decadent cupcakes and sweets, but also having baked goods that are really delicious. I have stopped in twice. I must say they have amazing window displays (I loved the colourful macaroon tower today) but inside the shop  it feels cramped, stuffy and hot. Both times the shop has been swarmed by squawking teenage girls, too. Despite this, the cakes are gorgeous and the brownies are delicious!
4 Darn tasty cupcakes. The price is right (~£2 per cupcake) and the peanut butter & chocolate cupcake has a magical Reese's-sized PB bite hidden inside.  You may need milk.
2 These cupcakes look stunning! In fact they look so good they make you think they even taste better then they do!  I've been to Bibi's 3 times now. I'm not quite sure why. maybe its been the people I was with (different each time) or the fact that all those times happened in the first 6 months of living here in Scotland and I was just drawn in by the beauty of the cupcakes...  But lets break it down. they icing taste more like harden lard with sugar. its not delicious, its not smooth, the texture is hard and I do not want to eat all of it ( which is ridiculous b/c I get icing shots at a cupcake place in CA. I LOVE my icing!)  Next the cake... I know its Scotland and people like their cake her dry and crumbly, but listen theres no pouring cream for the cupcakes so make mine moist!  Too dry or too dense. the only one I had which I would get again IF I HAD to go back, would be the Victoria sponge cupcake. The icing was better then the others ( probably b/c it was inside and not decorative) but still just meh, nothing to rave about. Sad b/c I like a good cupcake, but this is not the place for it yet there seems to be so many Bibi's around and I can't figure out why!?
5 I have eaten a lot of cup cakes so I like to think I am a great judge of cupcakes. This place is fantastic!! In just the 3 months I have lived here I have visited Bibi's a few too many times. I have tried the chocolate ganache,  chocolate cheesecake, After Eight (mint) and espresso. They are all so amazing!! Their vanilla frosting isnt the best I have ever had, I personally think it is way too sweet and dense, but the mint and chocolate icing are fantastic! Not only is the frosting worth 5 stars but the cake is always so moist and flavorful!! Plus sometimes there is a little surprise inside the cupcake!! With such a great location and cupcakes this place cant be beat! (My boyfriend loves the macaroon, but since I have never eaten one I dont feel like I can rate them here)
2 Oh Bibi's! We could have been so good together!  Never one to turn down a gander at a pretty bakery, I thought I'd just have a quick peek inside. Two macarons later, I was on my way. I got a huge whiff of cupcakey goodness walking through the door and was pretty taken by the lovely colourful baked goods lined up next to the counter.  After reading mixed reviews about the cupcakes on Yelp, I decided to try a salted caramel and a raspberry macaron for £1.75 each. I love macarons and have baked many in my time. These macaron shells were very bumpy, a bit too cake textured and the cream inside was very buttery and rich. Not only was the texture a bit off, but neither of the macarons tasted much like the flavours they claimed to be.  Aesthetically, this place is nice. The cupcakes and macarons all look very cute. Overall verdict? Just a bit too pricey for the quality of product that is offered.
4 The macaroons are great!! ! The cupcakes also look delicious! I only wish that they were open earlier in the morning so I could take some treats into work. Parking in the area is a nightmare ( as expected ).
4 Show me your cupcakes!!  Fab little bakery nicely located on Fredrick Street. I bought 12 cupcakes ...for a friend... and they looked delicious! Nicely presented in  cute Bibi's Bakery box and the lovely girl who serviced me was all smiles. I would avoid on warm days as I can imagine the shop getting cramped pretty quickly
