4 Ok....so this is probably not the nicest store to display beautiful shoes but everytime I come here just to browse, the salesfolk have always been really nice and helpful. So the other day, I decided to make the investment and purchase a pair of khaki patent leather open toed heels. A perfect pair to go with almost everything and it was even more perfect that they had my size (fyi sizes tend to run small so get a 1/2 size up) and it was 50% off! woohoo! I think this may be a dangerous addiction...
2 I'm hoping this is the store in the Venetian.    Salesguy was really nice.  Went to the back to find me a shoe that he thought I might like.  Not really my style, but I appreciate the effort.  Here's the problem.  Me: "Do you have any bridal-ish shoes?" Him:  "No, actually, we're not expecting too many new styles.  Jimmy Choo is sort of phasing out that line throughout.  They're not selling that well." Me:  (thinking, hmm.  ok.) Literally 2 hours later, I receive an email from Jimmy Choo headquarters, ALERTING ME TO THEIR LATEST LINE OF BRIDAL SHOES.    omfg.    The two stars is for the guy trying, but seriously... epic fail.
5 This is for the JC at the Venetian. I like their service. Bought a Ramona and a pair of flats. Speedy, just like I needed it. Bought it right before departure time (+time needed to go to the airport!).
5 I live in pgh Pa in the spring &summer n winter park fl in the winter & fall we do not have a Jimmy Choo in pgh and the Orlando store is limited on stock so I love the Vegas stores, whenever I'm in Vegas we usually make it to all JC stores and I have always had good service and selection is awesome.
3 very expensive and not that impressed.
