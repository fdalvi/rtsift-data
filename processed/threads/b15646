5 These guys are the best. Very knowledgable about wheels and tires. Great selection and inventory. Always friendly and professional. Highly recommend to anyone that needs a small fix or a complete set of wheels.
5 I've been coming to the same tire shop ever since I was a kid riding in the backseat with Mom.  Same owners too...crazy!  We used to go there years ago because my mom was on a budget and needed fair prices on used tires.  Fit the bill!  Now that I am grown, I have special needs for my custom wheels and tires, including stretching tires on 20s and not wanting scratches or damage to the wheel lips!   Happy to say, Crown delivers on fair prices, brand new top of the line tire and wheel equipment, knowledge of mounting custom wheels and tires, stretching tires, and knowing English!!   Hahahaaa  Neighborhood sucks, and the place is a little intimidating to someone not from "the hood", but give them a try, especially if you are rolling on $3000+ wheels!  They are the only ones I trust with my wheels!
5 Pops has been here since I was in high school "RANCHO" :-) I am now 45 years young and have still relied on Pops for great service. You can always come back home to his tire shop when in need of good customer care. He has always been one to TRUST!!! His employees and family are really the best!!!!!! Although his used tires last and last. He will continue to be in business because he truly cares about his customers!!! To this day, I am very THANKFUL that this tire shop is still here!!!!!
