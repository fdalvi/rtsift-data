4 A coworker recommended this place and I'm glad she did. This place offers solid, delicious take out.  I've tried their meatball sandwich, grilled chicken sandwich, and calzones. The only disappointments I've had were: no sandwich rolls one night and poor quality chicken on the sandwich. However, it was still delicious.  I can't speak of the actual restaurant (apparently it's full of hunky dudes?), but I've had great experiences with Brioni To Go. Great Italian grub in the desert.
4 First off a confession: I've never stepped foot inside of Pasta Brioni. But I've been getting taking out from the joint since, literally, the day I moved into my house. I stick to the basics--a nice pollo con penne dish and a white pizza. I like it. The delivery is quick in the neighborhood and the drivers are always cute. I'd choose Brioni's over any chain any day, but I'm that sorta gal.
4 My go to for weekend dinners. It's quick when you call in, and the food is great for a take out place. I've never been to the restaurant side but it always seems to have a decent amount of people in it
