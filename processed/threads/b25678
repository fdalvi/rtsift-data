5 Great service, great prices, and Albert is an avid ASU alum.  And my kids love his dog.  Five stars!
5 I have used many cleaners over the years, and you can't beat the wonderful, personal service from Albert and Natural Cleaners. I don't dry clean as much as I used to, but I feel very lucky to have been referred here! It's the only place I'll go in town.
5 After other cleaners ruined my neon pink and white dress, I thought my dress would never be fixed; then I found Natural Cleaners.   Natural Cleaners is the only dry cleaner I will take my work clothes to and I never worry about smelly chemical residue, bleeding colors or horrible ironing.  Love, Love, Love Albert and his puppy for saving my dress and allowing me to be pretty in Pink all year long :)
1 Albert frankly does not understand customer service and has a lousy attitude toward his customers.  When you make a commitment to have a dress ready on time for a wedding, you do it. His answer,  "I have a lot of customers, not just you!". " When I told him "I would take my business elsewhere next time ", He proceeded to look up my customer history so he could tell me that "I don't give him enough business to matter anyway". I guess the customer does not matter at Natural Cleaners.  Please avoid this business at all costs!!!!!!!!
5 Best dry cleaners services plus alterations. They don't use hard chemicals so your cloths smell fresh and not like other places that use lots of chemicals. They also box wedding dresses and other keep safe garments. Best part is its locally owned. Albert, the owner, is super friendly and carries your cloths to your car when you have a heavy load. Once he recognizes you parking he will begin pulling your order or preparing your drop-off. Customer service is their hallmark. Give them a try and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
