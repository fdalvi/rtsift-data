5 Best nail salon service in town. The girl are super nice and friendly.
2 Friendly new ownership. Little disappointed it took close to 2.5 hours for a new set and a pedicure and I was the only person in. Price was a little high for my liking. 80 with tip for a full set and pedicure. Did a standard French tip acrylic set and French tip pedicure. My full set was uneven and grew out pretty gross. Sad as it was my go to close to the house. Have found a new place!
5 I have been to Luxury Nails Bar several times and this place is the best in Peoria. The owners super nice, the place is so clean. The best part is free coffee, water and sodas. I was there with 10 of my friends for her bridal party. All of my friends love the place, the price is great.  We're decided to have girls day out here at Luxury Nails Bar monthly. Keep up the good job!
5 Finally someone in the state of Arizona that knows how to do liquid gel nails! Just moved to the area and have tried 5 other nail salons which were terrible.  Fast nail service,  owners and employees are super friendly, they have a keurig!! Salon is clean which is very important to me. Will be back as long as they continue good service and remain clean.  Would definitely recommend.
