5 Thank you, thank you, thank you to whoever at ASU is organizing this. Its nice to finally have food trucks coming to Tempe, rather than having to drive out to downtown Phx and fight/pay for parking, only have 5 minutes to order and eat before having to get back on the road.  5-6 food trucks (varies every week), music, and tables set up so you dont have to stand around and eat.  Awesome. Please keep it going!
5 Love having the food trucks close to campus. It is a great use of the empty lot and a nice convenience for those who are at ASU. Though check back with me in July to see if I feel the same about melting while eating my food.
4 This is a fun way to get your food truck fix! There are 6-7 different types of food trucks present, so there is always great variety. I wish the Grilled Cheese Truck was there, it's my favorite! Seating can be limited, as can parking. Otherwise, it's a great spot to stop by for lunch.
