2 Took my dad there to get him some suits for his birthday. The suits are $200, roughly, unless you get the, buy one get two free deal; they jump up significantly if you go for the package deal. I was very annoyed by the sales woman. It was worse than being at a used car dealership. I would try to talk to my dad about what he liked and she would just jump in. I told her I would come get her if we needed something and after 5 min she started to chime in again. I don't think she was the brightest, however the deals are good and she was nice.  Without a doubt, Jos Banks doubles or triples the prices and then gives discounts. Im going to stick to the Mens Wearhouse. We did get my pop a couple golf shirts for $55 out the door.
2 Not bad customer service, but I do always feel that I get profiled in these types of stores for being younger (not the average CEO's age) and therefore they assume I'm not going to spend much here. It's always the minimum service, but well done minimum service. There online deals when they run promotions is the only reason I may buy here. Very generic selection.
2 This review is about a tuxedo rental from this location that nearly went wrong.  Because it contains all of the details of my story, I'm going to include the email I sent in to Jos a Bank customer service.  ________________________  On the 28th of August 2013 I visited a Jos a Bank location at 20028 N 67th Ave in Glendale AZ and a friendly representative named X helped me get measured and choose a tuxedo for a black tie event I was attending on Sept 14th.   After choosing and ordering the rental, none of the point of sale computers were able to ring me up for the rental or even a deposit, but X let me know that I could pay in full when I picked up the Tuxedo.   On the Monday before my event, I called the store to inquire when I was to expect to be able to come in and try on my tuxedo, and was told by the woman on the phone that it wasn't in store yet, but assured me I would be called when it had arrived.   On the Thursday before the event, I called the store again wondering about the status of my order, this time speaking with X, who after researching found that the order for my tuxedo had been canceled and that she would arrange for it to be re-ordered and next-day shipped to the store and would be ready for me to come in and try on Friday (the day before my event).   I was notified by a phone call from the store that my rental had arrived on Friday & drove there to try it on and pick it up.  Fortunately, the fit was fine (X had done a good job!) but I was surprised that I wasn't offered any sort of discount for my nearly averted formal wear catastrophe.   I've been shopping at Jos a Bank for a few years for suits for work and other various dress clothes, but this series of events has left me feeling like I should shop elsewhere (not the least is the profound feeling that I will NEVER rent formal wear from Jos a Bank).  I do want to be clear that I do not think that there was any negligence on the part of the sales associate X, but it seems that the underlying systems failed in both the cancellation of my original order and the fact that it didn't appear that X was empowered to do anything but offer me words of apology.   ________________________  A day later, I got an email from customer service instructing me to call into an 800 number and speak to one of two names.  Below is the response I sent:  _________________________  I tried calling in - got put immediately into a queue without speaking to a human - waited and listened to repetitive music for 2 mins before a machine tried to have me leave a message.   It's not clear to me what more I could say in a voicemail than I did in my original lengthily and descriptive email.  How about if you have any questions for me, email them as the telephone method seems less reliable.   _________________________  Two days later, I got another email stating the I'd be contacted by the regional sales director.  I missed his phone call, and he left a voicemail.  At this point I was pretty tired of the entire situation and so when I reached HIS voicemail I told him that I'm not fishing for a refund or some sort of discount - I simply was trying to let them know about how their underlying sales systems had broken down and nearly failed me. I never heard another word via phone or email.  TL;DR I'm not shopping at Jos A Bank any more, especially not for formal wear rentals.
