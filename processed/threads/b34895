5 Great treatment on my shin-splints!  Almost cured them in only one treatment.  Not only that but I got a great adjustment as well.
5 I came here because of a sharp pain in my neck along with some tightness/discomfort in my upper back. I painfully suffered through 3 weeks before coming to see Dr. Johnson.   Dr. Johnson is one of the most professional and knowledgeable doctors I've ever worked with. He was able to release some of the tightness in my back and diagnose my neck pain. I walked out feeling far better than when I walked in. This is the place to go! I had a great experience and highly recommend him!
5 I saw Dr. Johnson for neck and shoulder pain while I was traveling. He was very thorough in his assessment and treatment. I had ART and adjustments in the office and then he gave me exercises for home. I felt much improved immediately and it was great to have the exercises for self care at home. Highly recommend
