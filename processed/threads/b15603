5 This is where I get my smog checked every year.  Everyone here is always friendly and there's never usually a line when I go so I'm pretty happy about that.  Plus, after I get my smog done, "Nate" hooks me up with some tunes to throw in my stereo for the ride home, to the DMV, etc.  How about that for service!
5 Went here to get my mother's car smog checked. It's just around the corner from our house, so that right there was a huge advantage to going here. I drove right up, got everything done in less than 10 minutes, was able to pay by credit card, AND got a CD out of it; for those scoring at home, it was a Los Tigres del Norte CD (East LV por vida!). Easily the most stress free transaction I've ever had involving a car.  If you're ever in need of a smog check and you're on the far east side of town, hit up Nate's.
5 Very fast service and a free music CD to boot. Definitely recommend this place.
5 I came across this place last year and love it!  I was in/out in less than 15 mins, with a free CD.  He then referred me to a kiosk located in a grocery store around the corner and got my tags right there.  I will be going here every year.
5 This place is the best. Literally only took 5 minutes and I was on my way. Granted, I came on a Sunday and it usually looks pretty busy on Sundays. But, I pulled right in and got serviced with lightning speed. The service and work flow of this place is on point and always a pleasure to stop by and chat with the workers for a few minutes. They still have free CDs for everyone who comes to get smog'd and I decided to pick up the RHCP best of this time around and jammed off as soon as I got my receipt and my smog certificate.  Not a bad way to get my annual smog done!   Nate's is the best, hands down. Will be here again and again.
5 Who reviews a Smog place?? I do. Why? Because they are fast and friendly here. This is the only place I go to when it comes to that time of the year. They make the process as painless and easy for you as it can get. Thank you for that!
