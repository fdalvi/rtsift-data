4 Two words: Choco Taco. Do you remember when you would chase down the ice cream truck with a fistful of change just to get your grubby little hands on one of these delectable morsels? Maybe I am the only fat kid to do this.   Why do grocery stores not sell boxes of this nostalgic treat? Maybe it is because they know that people will pay the $1.79 for one. It is a crime that 7-Eleven is one of the only places were you can pick it up. Oh well, looks like there is another reason to come here besides to get my Slurpee fix.
5 Its 7-11 what to say? The Staff is funny and they joke around and make your wait not as bad when there is a lone.
1 This is my neighborhood 7-11 I always go there never a issue but today I went and got told to open my bag because someone stole yesterday and had the same bag as me and she was checking bags there was 3 other chicks with big bags & they didn't get checked? And i was the only hispanic one there along with my husband She was only checking mine it was very offensive to me I stormed out not quite like I should have but I told her it was wrong what she was doing & she just laughed I can't believe people like this get hired ! I loved that store been going there for years !
