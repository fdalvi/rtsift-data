2 Not very exciting, I'm sorry to say.  We had the philly cheesesteak sandwich, and rib basket combo.  Both were entirely underwhelming and left us thinking we could do better making these dishes at home.  In fact, we'd be more inclined to eat at the divey JB's in Sun Prairie than stop here again.
1 This place has never been good.  I went about a half dozen times when it first opened because they had 99 cent taps and 50 cent wings during happy hour.  The taps were bud/miller and the wings were blah, but for the price it was a good deal.  The service was always slow and anytime I got food outside of that it was bland and overpriced.  I tried this place last night after about a year or so absence.  The place was dead.  The server came up and asked what we wanted to drink.  He then informed us they "have soda and beers."  Wow, thanks!  I asked if they had a beer list and was told no, just look at the taps.  Ok, not the end of the world I guess.  When we were ordering we were told of the buffalo wing special which was some wings and fries for whatever price.  My friend ordered that and was then told they were out of boned wings and had only boneless.  I ordered the half ribs / half chicken combo.  About five minutes later the server yelled from behind the bar "what kind of sauce you want for your ribs?"  Then after about another five minutes he came back and said, oh we are out of ribs.  So, out of wings and out of ribs.. got it.  The food wasn't awful, but again, bland.  We asked him to split the bill down the middle, just cutting the cost in half.  This was too much for him to handle I guess.  He said this was the best he could do, my bill had my food, the appetizer, and one of my friends beers.  My friends bill had his food, my beers and his beers.  My total was $28 and his was $20.  I guess that's kinda half.. sorta... maybe.  Needless to say this place wont be missed when it goes out of business.
