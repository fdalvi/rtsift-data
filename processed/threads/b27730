4 Located about 1.5 miles north of downtown Chandler, Magic Kabob is a great addition to the Chandler ethnic restaurant scene.  The restaurant has just opened and I visited on a Sunday afternoon and the grand opening sign was flapping in the breeze.  I ordered the Chicken Kafta sandwich lunch special which includes either french fries or soup.  I went with the soup which was a tasty crushed lentil.  The kafta was wrapped in a thin pita and had a garlic sauce with an assortment of chopped pickles which was excellent.  Normally in I think of kafta as a finely ground meat, but in this case there were chucks of marinated chicken.  The restaurant is open 7 days a week for lunch and dinner and I will definitely be stopping by again to try some of the entrees like grilled lamb chops or vegetarian ghallaba which is a savory Lebanese stew.  For vegetarians there are the usual options for a middle eastern restaurant (tabbouli, fattoush, falafel, stuffed grape leaves, hommous, and baba ghannooj etc) and few specialty items.
5 Magic Kabob is a breath of fresh air to Chandler.  I ordered the stuffed grape leaves and the gyro platter. The lentil soup came with the entree and it was quite tasty. There was plenty of food to take home. Magic Kabob has outstanding authentic Mediterranean food with an inviting atmosphere.
