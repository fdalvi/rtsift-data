1 Horrible experience.  Unscrupulous people.  We needed someone to open the door to our nursery and they quoted us $49.50 + $20.  We decided to take the first person we called because we wanted someone immediately.  He locksmith showed up one hour later and demanded $49.50 + $125 or he wouldn't open the door.  We finally agreed to his "special price" of $49.50 + $85.  It took him less than 10 seconds to open the door.  We called the company to complain.  Linda apologized and was willing to refund the difference but I think she must have been shut down.  The second call we got regarding our complain pretty much inform us that what is done is done.  That the price is $49.50 + $20 and up.  Make sure you record what they quote you.  When you are experiencing an emergency you are an easy target for this kind of predators.
1 The location listed for 24/7 Lock Pro is for a group of local stores including Starbucks.   The telephone number is a busy signal.  So, I'm not sure if they're still in business. (See photo).
1 Horrible experience.  Quoted $120 on phone. Showed up to make a key for my truck and within 10 minutes the price had jumped to almost $300. Then they claimed they couldn't get "the codes" and that meant that it was going to cost nearly $500.  I sent them packing and had a new key made the next day for $175 total by U.S. Key.  Definitely use U.S. Key - and not these guys.
