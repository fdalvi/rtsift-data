5 I am a huge fan of this store, in fact I'm not sure it's a store... it's more of a community! If you need DJ equipment, they can definitely help you out and their rates are lower than what you'll get at Guitar Center. Plus, they will work with you to make sure you get what you need (and want). They also sell DJ lights, not my current needs - but good to know they have it.  The community aspect is that they offer free sessions to introduce extraordinary world of DJing to newcomers. If you're looking for digital DJ tips, go on any Tuesday from 4-6pm. Or, if you're into learning more about the classics... vinyl (old school DJing), visit MC Audio on Wednesdays between 3:30 and 7:30pm.  They are great at igniting (or re-lighting) the fire and motivating people to keep at it. I plan on visiting them regularly!
5 MC Audio is awesome. Mike the owner is the man and helped shape my taste in electronic music and taught me a lot about DJing. The first time I came in to buy vinyl I ended up going out to lunch with him.   Never go to Guitar Center. Ever, ever, ever.
5 All the guys at MC Audio rock. I love coming here & hanging out. Mike is an awesome and nice guy (and super fun to dj with!). If you need dj equipment, lights, speakers, etc - they offer good advice/lessons/tips/tricks/etc and offer the best prices in Madison. This should be your one and only stop for all things dj related.
5 I own and operate a mobile DJ company. MC Audio is my GO TO place for all of my gear needs. These guys not only know their stuff, but have great customer support and top notch pricing. I've never been anything less that totally happy with my purchases there, and I've spent thousands of dollars on speakers, controllers, lights and more.   DO NOT buy at guitar center or even amazon until you give these guys a chance to beat the price. I've never even had to ask and the prices always come in less than others.
