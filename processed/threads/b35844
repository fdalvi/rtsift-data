5 UWCU is a phenomenal financial institution. In all my dealings they have always been straight-forward and honest.  Tellers are always friendly and helpful and their financial advisers are great at sitting down and distilling complex financial topics in a no-nonsense manner.  We have worked with Matt Deadman in the past and have been continually impressed.
1 Poor customer service. It's a very cold and uninviting environment. I've tried banking at 'this location' twice most recently with my my daughter to open a new account as she prepares to venture off to college. I watched as a staff person responded to questions in a condescending manner. Very cold customer service, making what should have been an exciting time for my daughter to a teachable moment where I said 'you have other options to go where your business big or small will be appreciated.
