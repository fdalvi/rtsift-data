1 If u want a fried burrito roll come here. This is not sushi !!! Service was horrible and the prices were outragous ! 9 sake bomb ??? thats crazy !! Real Sushi places are @ $6 dollars max. I only give 1 star for the TV' s and music. Really stay out from this place if u are a real sushi lover cuz ur not gonna find any real food there.
4 I was here on business and my friend suggested I try here.  I'm adventurous, so I was game with the whole Mexican sushi concept.  I tried the Mexican roll first.  It had spicy crab, salmon tempura, and the taste was pretty original, also had a slight spice to it.  The waitress told me that the Fire Cracker jalapenos were good so I went for those.  All I can say is I have never every considered jalapenos in sushi, but with the spicy ahi, and crab, these chefs really know what they are doing.  Really good!  I only had time to try 2 things because I had a meeting, but I'll be back again in 2 months, so I'll go back if I'm in the neighborhood.  I think its so cool that almost every sushi chef in either Scottsdale or Phoenix are Mexican.  I guess like my chef friend in New York said, Mexicans are really the best cooks in the world, but Sushi, who knew!
3 Se単or sushi was an interesting experience. The atmosphere is kind of funny. It looks like it was a night club before. The windows are still blacked out and there is a giant wooden dance floor and huge bar. It was a little weird. It did not feel like a sushi place.  Anyways, I had a groupon so we decided to check it out for lunch.  We seated ourselves and the baby. FYI, they have good high chairs where my baby can't crawl out.  The menu had some fun things like edamame with tapatio. We decided to try 3 rolls- tres quesos, Milana, and guacamuchalito. We also got fried rice for Baby to chew on.  The rolls were pretty expensive. 11 dollars per about.  Wow these rolls were huge! We ordered waaaay too many. We can usually split 3 rolls between us but not here. We had so much left over. I would prefer them smaller and cheaper so I can keep up a variety. I love to get many different kinds of rolls and not just 1 or 2. Fortunately we had a groupon, so the price was not too bad.  The rolls were very tasty. I was a fan of the queso one, and hubby liked the guaca one. The problem was we only got friend cheesy rolls so it was a very heavy meal. I didnt leave the sushi place feeling like I got pretty healthy food like I usually did. I went home and took a nap and was still stuffed.   I did not find any problems with the service. It was fine for me.   Now the question will we be back? Hubby says he probably won't because he likes traditional healthy food. I would go back with a friend and another groupon but would order a lot differently.
3 So if you are looking for a authentic sushi experience, then I say, maybe this is not your place. I wouldnt order sashimi from this place, but I am really picky about that. This place has an awesome, lively, fun, truly different take ~ latin inspired sushi. So most of the rolls are deep fried, but it was delicious! The loud music, nightclub type atmosphere was a lot of fun. Here is my one complaint - MY GOD, it took FOREVER for the food to arrive. One of the folks in my party of 6 waited 45 minutes for ONE sushi roll. My husband waited 30++ minutes for his roll to arrive also. I think the annoying thing about that is to wait almost an hour for ONE sushi roll, have it happen to multiple parties at the table, none of the food arrived together, and for them to ADD 18% gratuity to service like that. Its presumptuous - why would I tip 18% for what I would consider poor service? None of us got to eat together, I ended up sharing my sushi rolls with the other folks at my table who were still waiting on their rolls 45 minutes later.   Here is a tip - order a salad or the teriyaki chicken, that came out the fastest or just dont go their hungry. It was definitely worth the experience.
3 We had a little trouble finding this place at night. They didn't  have a lit up sign! Once we did find it, we went inside and were seated right away in a nice big booth. There was a live DJ playing upbeat Spanish music. It was kind a cool vibe once you got used to it. Staff were courteous. Service is a bit slow, even with many staff standing around chatting. The waitress brought bowls of sauce but never told us what kind of sauce it was. she also didnt recommend any particular items to us. This is a fusion place, so wouldnt you want to push your unique dishes? The menu was a little small and had a lot of cooked rolls, but the food was very good. Actually it was better than good! I could see coming here with friends for an evening out. I saw some drinks pass by that looked delicious. We ordered a Las Vegas roll, a Shrimp Killer, and another spicy roll. Very yummy! Lots of good flavors. It would be nice if you got some soup, salad, or edamame with your order like most sushi places, but not a real big deal. I would just beware that waitstaff seem very inexperienced.
3 Your service sucks during the day..change lighting in this place please or better yet just peel that ugly ass tint off the windows so the sun can shine on thru..Your chicken fried rice is bomb taste like a teppenyaki spots rice..nice. big ass rolls too..so if two people order different rolls u are not gonna finish that shit..3 stars for the rice..I like rice.
2 I didn't like this place and I won't be back. I've had Mexican/Japanese fusion sushi in Tucson and loved it, but this place is far from any type of traditional sushi and not in a good way. First of all, we couldn't even find the place. We had a groupon so that's how I even heard about it in the first place. I called about 20 times and each time it went straight to a voicemail that hadn't been set up. The place has blacked out windows with NO SIGN, just a small flashing neon "open" sign. The atmosphere is weird. It's a very large open space with lots of black furniture and a dance floor? It looks either very unfinished or like a grimy sports bar, since it has huge tvs and a huge bar that covers one entire wall. I didn't find the wait staff too friendly, well trained, nor professional. It took over 45mins to get our three rolls. We had to ask for obvious things like dipping plates, soy sauce, etc. I agree with some of the other reviews that their orders are large and we had plenty leftovers. I also agree that the food here is extra unhealthy. Everything is either deep fried or overly covered in mayonnaise-based sauces. We ordered the tootsie, volcano and carne asada and the carne asada was the best, although it was deep-fried. I didn't feel like I had a healthy meal, good service nor a pleasant surrounding environment.   Also, I used their restroom and of the two stalls, one had the toilet seat broken and laying on the floor and the other had a door that didn't close properly. =/
3 Oh, where to start...  Let's start with the food.  Ordered the jalapeno appetizer, Mexican Roll, Mohica (Momila??) Roll, and chicken tenders with fries (for the kiddo in our dinner party).  The jalape単o app was muy delicioso and not at all what I was expecting!  They were jalape単os sliced in half lengthwise, lightly and crispily breaded and stuffed with crab among other things.  The jalapenos were super fresh -- they appeared to be uncooked despite being breaded, which gave them a surprisingly good crunch!  The Mexican roll was my favorite roll -- it looked like your traditional sushi roll but with a latin interpretation.  It came with a dipping sauce that was difficult to figure out exactly what was in it... but I found myself soaking my roll in it!  And their special spicy sauce is outstanding.    The kitchen... was about as slow as they come.  After maybe 30 minutes, the chicken tenders came out.  It took another 25 minutes or so before the jalape単o app came out... and maybe 15 more minutes before the Mexican roll arrived.  And then maybe another 15 minutes before the Molica (Mimolca??) roll was delivered.  I am glad the children's dish came out first, but I would think both dinner dishes would have been served at the same time.  And seriously, it was a LONG wait time for food preparation.  The service was pretty friendly, but it took at least ten minutes before our server initially stopped by our table.  Granted, it was a super busy night... but there were a handful of times when I looked for a server but was left sitting there for five or ten minutes trying to catch her attention to ask for this or that.    The ambiance and setting... like other reviews state,  this place looks like more of a dance club with the lights on... so maybe trying to dim the lights wouldn't be a bad idea.  And the dark tint on the front glass is just tacky.  Maybe this is one of those places that turns into a club afterhours... so if that's the case, then maybe they could just pull off the tint by the front door so you it seems more inviting and open from the outside?  Not sure why the tint bothers me so much, but it does...  Next time I'd probably order carryout.
5 please do NOT visit this restaurant if you're looking for spicy tuna, dragon, or any such other standard sushi fare.  This is not your typical sushi restaurant, but a place where, (happily) not many people seem to go, because they haven't discovered it yet.  I had no idea this place existed.  I've driven by the shopping center at 43rd Ave & Indian School Rd at least twice a week, and if it wasn't for a Groupon deal, I would have missed out on what is now a weekly must-visit for me.  They could chuck the entire menu in the garbage, and only serve the following fusion rolls, and I would be VERY happy to gorge myself at EVERY visit:   GUAMUCHILITO, CIELO MAR Y TIERRA, TRES QUESOS, CORDON BLEU  there's only ONE word to describe the sushi at this place: A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!  A word of caution: if you don't like deep-fried sushi, then avoid these rolls.  I LOVE the crunch texture and that's why they're my favorite.  Also, the portions are ENORMOUS.  one two rolls can feed two people without the need for appetizers, or dessert.  Make sure you go on an empty stomach, and you will be rewarded.
5 I was intrigued to try it when I saw the offer on groupon and because my fiance never had sushi before and I figured "Well he likes Mexican food and so do I" so this seemed like the perfect place for him to try it out. The place looks pretty to me honestly, I' am a person who prefers dark over bright light any day so perfect ambiance for me and he didn't seem to mind either. I went with the "Mexican Roll (Call 911!)" and he ordered hamburgers which kind of ticked me off because I wanted him to try something new but I got him to try a piece from my plate anyway. The wait time for the food was normal and once I tried it I instantly loved it. If you're the kind of person that LOVES spicy or hot foods I highly recommend getting the Mexican Roll. My fiance tried it too and loved it, and also loved his hamburger too. For dessert we ordered the fried ice cream, something we both never had before. I should've read the description on it though because its covered in coconut and I hate coconut but it didn't stop me from trying to eat it. The fried ice cream plate looked really pretty with strawberry slices placed perfectly around it with drizzles of strawberry syrup and hot fudge syrup, it was amazing. It all stayed under the groupon budget too (and yes we did tip). I highly recommend Senor Sushi!
4 It was ... different.  The location is totally sketch and looks like it doubles as a club some other days.  We didn't have any issues with the wait staff other than impressing the need for someone who spoke English (I can speak Spanish, but not well enough to order sushi in!).  She was attentive and generally perfect. We ordered the guamuchilito, milena, and a caterpillar roll.  Surprisingly, it was the caterpillar that I really loved and which is why Senor Sushi is getting 4 stars and not 3.  You also get a lot of food for the price, and Im not sure where the person who said the rolls were expensive is getting their sushi since this seems on target with the amount of food that your getting.   All in all, the whole experience was fun, definitely different and totally worth the drive.
4 Hey sushi lovers!  Hey Mexican food lovers!  The quarrel is finally over thanks to the latest fusion style restaurant in Phoenix- Senor Sushi.  Senor Sushi can be summed up in a few words. Japanese sushi restaurant meets Mexican Banquet Hall. The decor looks like a typical Japanese sushi restaurant with the red and black colors, lucky cat statues and green Asian plants. The layout and ambiance however screams, "Quincenera!". There is a stage with a disco ball in the middle it, which adds to the banquet hall feel of the restaurant. The restaurant has A LOT of staff- which I am sure is needed. When I visited the restaurant on Sunday it was at maximum capacity.  Mexican sushi? I was just as confused, but intrigued. My party ordered almost every fusion roll and here are the ones I recommend:  Caramelo roll- Delish! Who knew Mexican caramel over sushi would give it such a kick?  All of the rolls were pretty tasty to be quite honest :-)  The only one I would not recommend is the Carne Asada roll. The carne asada flavor takes over the roll making it not taste like sushi.   Overall, I would go back! The flavor explosion is seriously insane. Mexicans do not mess around when it comes to spices and flavor. I must say that I enjoyed this fusion combination and thanks to it sushi will never again be the same. Even the soy sauce has been revamped! It is already so flavorful it does not even need soy sauce.  Are you ready Phoenix? Let's do this! :-)
2 I've been coming to thus place since they opened up my 1st impression was this place is AMAZING, regardless of the fact that the ambience is so dull the food made up for it. The latin rolls are by far the best I've had here in the valley and their calamari salad the first few times was excellent, but there's been quite a few problems I've encountered my last visits and I just keep giving this place more chances but last night was the end of  it!!! I had the cielo mar y tierra roll which is covered in panko and deep fried the chicken, beef tasted like it had been cooked days before not fresh at all, and the oil that the roll was fried in must have been old because it made the roll taste funny and this has not been the 1st time this happened to me here my buddy ordered the gordon blue and had the exact same problem and when I ordered the kamasaki roll and didnt like it because the rice tasted odd the waitress did not wanna fix it for me nor even bother getting a manager to check out the situation so I ended up paying for something I didnt eat she was rude about it too! The calamari salad was blah and there was only about 5 other seated tables in the restaurant and we waited forever for our food to arrive. Lastly we had the "deep fried" ice cream which was hard as a rock when it got to our table we had to sit around and wait for it to thaw out a little and I didnt even bother to point it out to the waitress she would have done nithing anyway, overall I have eliminated this restaurant from my faves list and would not go back by any means unless they'd step theyre game up and take food and customer service seriously what a shame because their latin roll menu has so much to offer and the cooks are just not putting any effort in what they do. I only gave it 2 stars because at one point they did serve outstanding food but the customer service has always been terrible
5 I returned to Senor Sushi for dinner with the family last night. I have to changed my former 4 stars to 5 stars.  It seems that now that the Groupon frenzy is over, the restaurant is less crowded than usual. The reduced crowds ensured a much faster food preparation and server check in. The food was simply amazing. We had Jalapeno Poppers (the best in town!) Guanchito Roll and a Las Vegas Roll. So amazing. This place is amazing. It is now my go to spot for tempura sushi rolls. Delicioso!  PS. The Pina Coladas are out of this world! I went from liking this restaurant to LOVING this restaurant. Five stars!
5 I would have never found this place on my own...but word of mouth brought me and we will be customers for life! this place is amazing. I give it a 10. their Latin fusion rolls are to die for...come hungry. i had the kamikaze roll and it was better than anything I ever had in California. come eat here and you will be hooked. nicely appointed and a friendly staff. quiet too...you can actually talk. very clean and cool for the summer. I highly recommend this Latin fusion Japanese...it will blow your mind! order lots and share. enjoy!
3 It took me a good while to find this place, even with Google Maps, Apple Maps and my girlfriend telling me I was in the right spot (and those three never agree).  The windows are blacked out, but there is a little sign if you look up and a solitary neon flashing "Open". It honestly looked like a certain kind of video store from the 80's and 90's. The kind of video store doesn't carry Disney movies, if you know what I mean.   Inside is no less confusing. To the right is a decent sized bar with a bunch of big screen tvs. Ahead is a stage.  Service was friendly, but it helps if you can speak Spanish. The menu had some of the traditional sushi rolls, but you don't come here for those, you come for the Mexican Roll or the Guanchito roll. Deep fried and heavy, but tasty and massive! The highly recommended jalape単o poppers did not disappoint.  Worth the visit, but probably wouldn't make a return trip.
4 I ordered for carry out and the lady that I had spoken to said it would be 25 minutes. I got there in 30 minutes and my food still wasn't ready. They took forever, but other than that, I was pretty satisfied with this place. It was my first time trying it. Pretty affordable prices even though it wasn't happy hour. I'm definitely coming back when I'm on that side of town :)
1 Walked in with a reservation on a Monday evening at around 6 pm. Sat down with the boy. After 10 minutes, had not even been acknowledged- no " your server will be right with you" even, but the family that walked in 8 minutes after we did got place settings?! I didn't stay to try the food.  I will not stay at a place where the service is that horrible.
5 Wow this place has change, more staff, and food was ready in only 17min much faster than last time. Lots of improvements have been done here.  Food is still good.
5 We really enjoyed our evening at se単or  sushi. The rolls are deep-fried, Latin, and enormous. They're also quite delicious. I do recommend.
5 Last Saturday I was there group of Ppl   Any ways danceing cumbia bandas live band and mixed in DJ.  And Friday they play Spanish rock. I'm into Banda & Cumbia (:  yea I'm the only whit dude in there but love that fun dance in stuff very up bringing. The place is very roomy and clean great staff and its for all ages dancing there something for you youngsters 10pm on check it out Friday Spanish rock Saturday cumbia salsa banda  come check it out (:
4 Bring the family, lots of very large, comfy booths to sit and relax in! Let us use a 4 person Groupon deal for just the two of us.  Very nice place overall.  Quite a variety in sushi rolls. Latin rolls are the best!
4 I really enjoyed the Firecracker Jalape単os!  The Japanese/Latin fusion was interesting. I had the tres quesos roll, and cheesy sushi roll took some mental adjustment. The traditional crunchy roll my daughter got was better. The service was great - very friendly!!  It was worth the visit, though my husband thought the atmosphere (lighting and decor) was too much like an adult club.
1 first...hair found in sushi roll. second...screaming children. EVERWHERE. third...food was flavorless (except the 911 roll, which was very spicy and the best part of our meal).  service was ok. until it got busy, then we felt ignored.  so much for fusion sushi. we won't be returning.
5 Very fun place, sweet waitress, best crunchy roll ever and sports on TV!  They have this tropical tea that tastes like flowers and compliments the sushi so well.  Next time we're having the flaming roll and the carne asada roll!  We are in love!
4 Not the best decor not the best part of town.  But let me tell you probably the best green mussels I have ever had.  The sushi was great ! Fried ice cream was awesome. The beer was ice cold.  I will be back .
1 I wouldnt recommend this place at all. The food is not bad, but the service is horrible. The waitress are slow and dont seem to care. Even in slow days they still take for ever to do anything, even refills. We have placed several to go orders because we feel that way we dont have to deal with them, but even on to go orders they still make mistakes. The management should encourage more hospitality on the waitresse's behalf because this place seems to not really care about their customers. Most of the time is packed but there are a lot of aspects to improve.
4 Place is not much to look at, but I don't care much about looks as much as I care about the food.  For those who don't like raw seafood this place has several options for them because here the sushi rolls are fried.  If you are looking to try something new or if you want to eat sushi like they do in Mexico this is the place to come.
5 I highly recommend this sushi place, very flavorful. Reasonable price, so worth it. Service is excelent. Recomiendo este lugar, el sushi tiene muchisimo sabor. Los precios rasonables, el sabor lo vale . Te atienden fenomenal.
5 Love this place.  A little hard to find but worth the effort.  I will be a regular.
3 Overall I rate this establishment 3 stars. When we arrived we were greeted right away, we were seated at a table. It took about 2 mins for the server to come to our table to get out drink order, another 6 mins till we received the drinks. She looked a little busy. We decided to come here since we had a Groupon deal. Which included two Sake bombs, two salads or two soups, 2 sushi rolls any kind and a dessert. The server was very knowledgeable about the menu and she checked on us many times to make sure everything was going well. The rolls were great and very big portions. The dessert was also a hit with us fried ice cream with fruit. While we were there they also had live entertainment of a mariachi band. This venue also is a club on certain nights with booths surrounding the restaurant area with a huge bar. The decor was ok, I would go back if I had a Groupon the prices are a little high without it.
4 Bless Groupon for leading us to an unexpected find in Maryvale: Mexican sushi and a sizable, comfortable, and unusual venue to dine in.  Big comfortable booths line the perimeter, semi-encircling numerous tables stationed on the stained concrete floor.  The place is awash in a very oriental color scheme of deep red and black, while numerous flat screens broadcast futbol visible throughout.   Tucked away (I seem to go to a lot of places that are "tucked away") in a small 1/3 empty shopping plaza located on NW corner of 43rd Ave & W. Indian School, once you figure out it's in the plaza, the building housing Se単or Sushi sit's behind/ just to the north of the O'Reilly Auto Parts that faces Indian School Road.  There's a lit sign on the building that apparently wasn't there early this year, and I'll grant that with the front windows and door covered up with only a lit "Open" sign exposed, it is a bit reminiscent of an old time "adult" bookstore - except I don't recall seeing any of them with their windows and doors covered with huge color photos of sushi rolls.   They were doing a surprising amount of business for a Monday night but it's a good sized place and they were not crowded and we were seated immediately.  Our server greeted us nearly immediately, was most helpful, and maintained a smile throughout our interactions.  She took our beverage order right away, and brought those to us in short order.  I regret not being able to compliment her by name, as she was friendly, courteous and helpful, and in English, which I don't think was necessary for most of the other patrons, but was appreciated by us.   We ordered a very un-Mex-un-Japanese appetizer of "boneless terriyaki chicken wings served on a bed of fries". The chicken bites were good, and the fries tasty enough, but it did make for a  heavy start.  Norm ordered the Rainbow Roll ($11.95) and I the Melina ($10.95),  consisting of Shrimp, Chicken, Bacon, Avocado, Crab Meat, cucumber, Chihuahuah and Cream Cheese (deep fried), Poor doggie, but very good, and huge.  I've never seen a serving of sushi of that size, and I thought the Melina was excellent, and loved the flavors.  The Rainbow roll of  Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Tuna, Cucumber, Avocado, Spicy Se単or Sauce & Orange Sauce, I thought very good as well, though didn't detect the orange or spicy which  I may have missed on the side.  We were unable to finish and had a small amount leftover to take home.    The full price of our generous meal for two without the coupon would have been $35 (+tip).  I don't do sushi often but recall spending way more in a very informal place in DC more than 15 years ago - and leaving hungry.  We did not leave Se単or hungry tonight.   In other news, the stained concrete-floored dining area appeared clean.  The large, black-ceilinged interior  I thought had a night-clubbish feel to it.  Numerous families were dining and while I was surprised at the number of small children (burgers available on the menu if the kids aren't into rice & rolls, but not running loose and not obtrusive but for a shriek or two.  The men's room was clean and stocked with all necessities including TP, disposable seat covers, hand soap, paper towels, and working hand dryers.  If you're looking for "genuine Japanese style sushi" - go somewhere that claims to serve it.  In my limited sushi experience, you'll pay a lot more for a lot less.  "Genuine" is great, but don't let that stop you from appreciating a different take on the subject,   I think Norm R will agree our food was very good, the serving sizes downright shockingly generous, and our server could not have been friendlier or more helpful.  Your experience may vary, but as for me, I shall return.
4 Maryvale may be the last place to find a unique fusion restaurant, but here it is. Spacious and somewhat noisy (thanks to the multiple flatscreen TVs showing soccer games), this restaurant was quite busy on the weeknight that John M. and I went - a good sign, I think. The decor itself reflects the establishment's main concept: Mexican and Japanese combined. We shared our orders, starting with an appetizer of   boneless wings with fires, which were OK but far too heavy considering what would come next. The rainbow roll was good, as was the Melina sushi. The sushi servings were very generous and not typical of the serving portions you get in standard Japanese sushi restaurants, and the prices were good. Service was efficient and very friendly. This is definitely a good place to try if you're in the Maryvale area.
5 I heard about Se単or Sushi through a friend, who was having a birthday dinner there. Imagine my surprise that in that same week, they were running a Groupon deal. When I first heard about where this place is located, I was initially hesitant, as I'm not a big fan of the West Side. (What can I say, Central Phoenix kind of girl!) Still, I gave it a try and I've been a fan ever since!  The inside is HUGE, I think at one point it may have been a sports bar of sorts. The decor is interesting, and it works. On Saturdays they play great music and there is a dance floor. During the week, I have not experienced DJed music. They also have a full bar and TVs that are usually playing soccer matches, football games, or whatever other sport is on at any given time. Any day of the week it seems like a pretty popular place and has been clean. There are always many diners, including large families, and an extensive amount of staff. The staff are extremely nice and accommodating. I have noticed that they continue to make improvements to the space and additions to their menu, so that's a good sign. On one particular visit there were musicians playing guitars from table to table and a lady was singing. Her voice is incredible!   The best things on their menu are, of course, the Latin Fusion rolls. Deep fried concoctions stuffed with different cheeses, avocados, etc? YES PLEASE! Upon first bite, I knew I was in love. These Latin Fusion rolls are ginormous. Prepare to stuff yourself into a happy oblivion. They also serve traditional rolls, but why order those when you can get those anywhere?  From the drink menu, they have outstanding Micheladas. For dessert? Fried ice cream, please! If you're into appetizers, I never order them anymore here because they rolls are just too filling, I recommend the stuffed jalape単os.   I've recommended this place to other people since I have discovered it and they've also loved it as well. Glad I gave it a chance! I don't know of any other Mexican Sushi place in the valley, nor have I ever had this type of cuisine anywhere else.
5 I Loved se単or sushi! OMG I seriously couldn't believe how good the food is and how much I enjoyed it.
4 I hadn't been here for about a year and let me tell you that I was impress with updates on menu and service.   I went today for lunch with my sister, who by the way hadn't been there ever.  We were greeted  and seated immediately as we walked in by a very friendly waitress.  My sister and I had the "firecrackers jalape単os" as appetizer and order the "tres quesos", "rainbow roll" and "Culichi roll" to share.  Let me tell you, all of them are to die for. Best part is that this rolls are huge and very affordable.  My sister wanted to order a fourth roll just cause she is so used to sushi at other places were they come very small and only six slices. But I warned her that this place is nothing but generous on their portions.  We were extremely satisfied with our food and service.   To be honest, it took me this long to go back just because last few times I'd been there before today, waitresses were not friendly and took for ever to get our drinks and food delivered.  But this time everything was perfect.  I don't give them a 5 stars just because I believe their rolls need to be a bit tighter since we had to rush picking up the pieces and eating them before they crumble. But other than that I totally recommend this place.  Just be warned, portions are BIG so if u don't eat to much just order one roll or order a couple to share. Also be adventurous and try some of the Latin Rolls. I assure you won't regret it!!  Can't wait to go back!!!
1 The calamari tasted old and so did the eel. Old is not a comforting taste when eating sushi....
4 What a cool, bizarre assault on the senses!  Picture this, late night, post-Dodgers' spring training game at Camelback- and afterwards, it's 10:30 pm and we are hungry for something different.  YELP to the rescue!  Search "late night dinner" and up comes Se単or Sushi- not too far from our hotel.  Drive to a seemingly deserted strip mall...walk in...and are instantly assaulted by really good, really loud live salsa music and disco lights!  Order Sapporo beers, eat creative "Latin fusion" sushi made with jalape単o, Mexican cheeses, carne, and also good old standbys like Volcano rolls.  We wish there was one of these out here!  But you'll need to learn sign language to communicate!  Loud loud loud!  And girls taking selfies in the bathroom...
3 I wasn't really impressed. I may be due to the server automatically speaking Spanish to me, but I guess she probably feels the same way going to most places and having servers automatically speaking English to her.  Anyway, if you like sushi, it's a good place to go, but any other foods than that, forget it.  The shrimp and noodles dish tastes like they seasoned it with leftover ramen packets.
4 I like the sushi :) it may not be as fresh as others, but they have their own niche that I haven't seen elsewhere. I use the groupon, otherwise it's too pricey.
1 I have been here before many many times  Great food great staff just one thing I didn't like yesterday we had our reservation since one week right at the door they told me there's was a cover charge of 10$ because there was live music wich I I don't like  They reduce the cover fee to half because no one ever call me to let me know about the cover fee ( they were supposed to) I saw a lot of groups of more people that weren't getting charge really pissed me off I couldn't say no my mom was there my wife and all my family who knows maybe I never go back and I am sorry for my waitress no tip but auto tip was 25dollars
4 Wow! So, these guys (owners) learned how to make sushi from another great sushi restaurant chain in Arizona.  They learned very well and after many years they got together and opened Senor Sushi.  The location might not be glamorous but the food is.  The taste of the food is excellent.  You might not find all of the traditional sushi dishes here but you will find great sushi.  For the most part the menu is a Mexican infused sushi and it is amazing.  Especially if you like spicy food.  The service staff is still learning and with time they should get it together.  Lunch time is the best time to eat here. They have a stage so it might turn into a Mexican fiesta a night with live entertainment.  If are looking for a nice traditional Asian sushi place this might not be the place for dinner.  There is nothing romantic about the restaurant.  The decor does have some Asian influence but the staff screams Mexican restaurant.  The staff overpower the decor, but the great tasting sushi overpowers everything.  I've never ate carne asada sushi (pretty sure thats not sushi) but they say it is.  Give it a try and tell me what you think?  I've heard its good.  Anyway  If you are in the neighborhood give them a try the food is worth it.
3 The food was pretty good and my wife loved her dish which is also a good thing because she is not a big fan of sushi.  BUT one complaint, the service was horrible. I ordered a Dos X's and waited 15 minutes for her to come back to get me another. She brought our food in a hurry then almost left without her noticing my beer bottle was empty, my wife had to call her back and ask for another for me. So to sum this all up, food good, service bad.
3 The good was very good and different. Not alot if options for rolls, but there is something for everyone. There is no nigiri. It's very Latin oriented. There was a mariachi group playing on the weekday that i went. They have full live music on weekends.
