5 Love, love, love it. I didn't even know they were here, I was referred by their sister salon. I'm always hesitant trying a new nail place, but I shouldn't have worried!! Joseph did an amazing job on my nails, another true nail artist!! Go & check it out- they're fantastic!!  :D
5 I have never had a bad experience here! The techs are very friendly and have great ideas!!! Absolutely love my nails every time I go here!
2 I really wish I could love this nail salon! The people are friendly, especially Joseph, and it's a great location but three out of four times I have come here I've had a not-so-great experience. The first time the gel polish started peeling after four days (that has never ever happened anywhere else), the second time, I had the woman use Essie polish and she put me under one of those gel heating lamps (thought it was odd) and the polish melted so Joseph had to redo it.... and this last time I got gel polish, again, hoping that first time was a fluke and two days later it started to peel from the cuticles! I don't think they can be using great quality if this happens. Sucks, cause I wanted to love this place but won't be going back. I rather pay more for a great job, always!
5 Awesome!!! They are open today for the 4th of July!!! I'm in desperate need of a pedicure. Everything here is so clean.   They have liners for the pedicure chairs, every implement used on me for tidy service was taken out from a brand new sealed packet, including nail filers and buffers and discarded after the service.  They also have a punch card after the 7th service I can get a free pedicure or manicure!!! I love this place!!!
