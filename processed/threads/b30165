5 Eddie and everyone is always friendly and ALWAYS does a great job when I go there. I love to get the old fashioned shaves with my haircut, because they use a hot towel and warm shave cream... I would defiantly recommend them to every one in the area looking for  a haircut, shave to even eyebrows in a very nice shop with very nice people
5 By far the best barber shop I have found yet!! I live in peoria and travel to the other side of town, outta my way, to have them chop my mop.. highly advised the twins barber shop(s)
5 Always a top notch haircut.
4 I think I found a new barber shop... I loved this place. I went in for a straight razor shave and only had to wait for a few minutes to get into a chair. When I got into the chair, the barber asked tons of questions to make sure she knew what I wanted. I know a lot of people dont like spending a lot of time in the chair, but with a shave I'm fine with spending an hour or so in the chair. I also have really sensitive skin and I told her that and she made sure that she took a little extra time. They use hot towels and a great warm shaving cream that has a nice cooling effect. It was a great shave and she made sure that it was lined up and perfect before I got out of the chair. I will defiantly go back for my haircut. Prices are good to... $16 for a shave and $13 for a haircut....
5 I've been going to Twins for about 1yr now. FYI. My profile pic is one of those hats with hair on it. Not a twins job. Lol. Anyway, I get a high and tight skin fade. They always use a straight razor to perfect it. You walk into most haircut places and ask for a skin fade using a razor  and they look at you like you have 2 heads. I have never got a bad haircut from anyone. I don't wait for a specific barber.  Never been let down. Really purveyors of a dying art.
5 Eddie and Company run an excellent Barber Shop.  I have been a faithful client for more than ten years.  They're professionalism, friendliness, and attention to stylish detail results in a fresh cut. I recommend that you get your hair cut at The Twins Barbershop!
5 I just found my new barbershop. This place is awesome. Kc was my barber and she easily fixed my bad haircut and knew exactly how to cut my hair as if she had been cutting it for years. I am pretty anal when it comes to my haircut. I had been going somewhere else to the same barber for two years but he moved or quit. I took a chance with their new guy and let's just say that I won't go back there and ill definitely be going back to kc at twins.
5 This barber shop is great! Very clean. Everyone is friendly. Never had a problem.  Eddie has been cutting my hair since 1998. I would refer this barber shop to anyone man, woman, boy or girl.
5 I love this place.  Very old school.  Want it high and tight squared off with a straight edge? No problem!  Friendly staff, good haircuts, and reasonable prices.  Great alternative to the chains.  Highly recommend it.
5 Twin barber is the best shop in AZ. All barbers have amazing skill no matter who's chair you sit in. Ed is the most amazing barber I have ever had cut my hair.   They have a great environment & everyone there is very nice. They always try to take care of everyone there but when your in the chair. They put all the focus on you & have some great skill.
5 Staff is excellent!! Best barber shop I've been to in Phoenix!! Eddie is the man to see!! Love from Cali!!
