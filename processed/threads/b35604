5 This place is amazing! My brother-in-law lives a 3-minute walk away from this place, and boy, am I glad he does otherwise we would have never found it! I was having some severe poker withdrawal, and finally came here on a Monday night with my husband, his brother and our friend.   They had just finished a Monday night tourney that started at 7pm. We were supposed to make it for that, but got caught up with errands. We arrived around 9:00pm, and played a 10-man 1/2 cash game.   All the players we met that night were very cordial, good sport and fun to play with. The dealers, dapper in their matching purple button-downs, were very professional and polite.   The establishment was very clean and well-maintained. While we were playing, one of the dealers was cleaning and asking if any of us needed drinks. There were a few TV screens tuned into ESPN, a kitchenette, coffeemaker, water dispenser and fridge. They provide pretzels and a few other snacks, free of charge.   I highly recommend this poker room! It's a friendly spot with good people.
5 This is the premier poker room in Phoenix. Very attractive interior with the best poker tables in town, politeness is strongly encouraged, no swearing or course language allowed, very good staff,
5 No rake, no annual membership or fees.  Just a fun "home" game in a strip mall minutes from my parents' house.  They have 1-2 and 2-3 NL games and the min buy is $40, max is $500. Everyone is friendly and they offered us snacks and drinks while we played.  Since there isn't a rake or fee, don't be cheap (like one guy there) and tip the dealer generously.
