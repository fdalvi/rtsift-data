1 I came here thinking it was a butcher shop.  It's not.  They had a tiny display area but no butcher there.  It's more like a small grocery store from the 70s.  It has everything you need though so if you're looking to buy staples in the area, they should carry it.  Don't come here thinking you're going to get a butcher shop.  Definitely more farmer than butcher!
3 This is a small local grocery located off the main street in old buckeye. I go here for the sales on meat. That always what I end up walking out with. When they do have a good meat sale I go here. When you have a big meat eating family you have to go where the sales are. I do a walk around to see if there is anything else I can save on but usually find nothing. You can find the weekly ad on the internet before taking a drive out. Unless you live in phoenix there is one on 19th avenue and bethany I believe. Not too familiar with that one.
2 This place is ok. It's not great or even all that good, but it's ok.   They do have a decent meat counter, but there doesn't seem to be someone that is regularly there to help clients, at least not a true butcher or anyone that is really all that knowledgeable on the meat. There are good sales from time to time, but I found many of their prices to be a little (some more than a little) high.   They do have many of the items that you may find yourself needing in a pinch.
