1 For the life of me, I can't figure out why Wyndham would put this place within their family of properties. This is the worst place I've ever stayed and I've stayed at some pretty raunchy places. There's a strip club next door so that'll give you an idea of the type of clientele they have - whores and crack heads. Trash wes strewn about even though there are trash cans all around. In the 2 days we were there, none of it was ever picked up (walked by the same trash at least 1/2 dozen times...hey, I ain't touchin it). Felt like I was in the ghetto. The room was awful - stained everything and no way to get comfortable with the spring poking my a$$. The front desk staff was rude. What they pass for a continental breakfast is a joke. Old muffins, that's about it. And, I like a little sugar in my coffee but they said they didn't have any (and she very obviously really didn't give a s%*t that they didn't). It's cheap and the WiFi is free (not very secure - the password is 12345abcde - a good indication of how much of a joke this place is). Those are the only good things I can say about this place. I'd sleep on a park bench before I'd ever go here again.
1 No way Jose...... Desperate times calls for desperate measures. So find a safe place to park the car and sleep in it. Because this is not where you want to be. We actually had gasoline siphoned out of the moving truck we were using.  Go figure. :)  Bottom-line....it is need a major renovation......
1 What a complete and total dump.  Really, if you can't keep driving then get arrested or something.  Whatever you do don't stay in this nasty place.  I will never make the mistake of staying in a Knight's Inn again and, in fact, will question any Wyndham property.  The place is completely worn out.  No bucks spent in upkeep.  The phones don't work, the lights don't work.  I don't think it was a safe environment.  We were remote and exhausted or I would have kept going.  Whatever you do, don't stay in a Knight's Inn.
