2 This restaurant has been here for quite some time, hidden along a side street with office buildings surrounding this restaurant. It's been under new management for the past year or two.  My company orders lunch from here quite frequently as they do deliver to our office and, being so hot here in the summers, they think it's worth to have the lunches delivered.  To me, it just so, so.  I've tried about 4 items on the menu and I'll have to be really hungry to order something from here.    What I had: Turkey club tortilla wrap.   I've tried this sandwich the way it should be made but the french bread consumed the turkey and bacon, so I thought I would have them make it in a wrap. Like I said, it's just so, so, and for the price they charge, it wasn't a very big wrap ($7.75)  Very small menu, their menu consists of Salads (7 different varieties), Wraps (3 items), Breakfast (3 items), couple of items from France, Italy and America (Philly Steak, Roast Beef, Turkey Club).    I've had better for the prices they charge (average price $8), and their portions are not large, but if you're hungry enough and you don't want to go out in the heat, it's ok.
