5 Roger came out and optimized my home theater setup and programmed my programmable remote control (MX-650). He also fixed a bad electrical outlet we had while he was here.
5 Our experience with Roger, The Home Theater Doctor, has been very positive. He is very knowledgable and reliable.
5 Found Roger's company on the internet and checked to see how he was rated.  He is rated highly, has good references, is listed on Angie's list, and I found lots of great comments.  I will add mine to those.   I needed him to help me set up a single remote, a Harmony One, so that it would operate all of the activities and functions.     Roger knew what he was doing, checked everything to make sure it worked, and made sure I was satisfied.   Having him complete that effort was worth every $ !!!!!     Thanks Roger!!!
5 Roger came out quickly and solved our problem.  After dealing with the Geek Squad, I would definitely call the Home Theater Doctor again.
5 Roger just finished a custom installation for me mounting two flat screens with surround sound that included in-wall wiring. Roger was on time, on budget and the installation was flawless. He doesn't take shortcuts and he arrived with all the tools and parts needed. I would recommend The Home Theater Doctor to anyone needing audio/video work.
