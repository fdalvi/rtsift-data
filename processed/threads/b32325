5 Jason has been cleaning our car and the cars of friends for years.  I was sitting here writing reviews and I could not believe that he did not have a Yelp review, so I hope he is cool that I added him:)  He comes to our office and leaves our cars looking and smelling great.  He is especially good on the small details, which car wash guys always seem to overlook.  His full service cleaning is the best we have ever experienced and leaves us delighted to have our car look and feel so clean, fresh and sparkly!
5 I have used completely clean for several years for my cars and company trucks and they are fabulous always on time and will work on meeting me were my trucks or cars  are even at last minute to get them cleaned Thank you
5 Jason has been washing & detailing my car for a year now, and it never ceases to amaze me how he can transform it from my mess ( average 120 miles a day...)  to a showroom condition time after time.  Excellent pricing, Super service, great pricing.  Completely Clean is the ONLY clean for my car!
