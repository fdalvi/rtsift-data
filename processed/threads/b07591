5 I have had my Insurance with this company for about 23 years now. They have always been very helpful to me in all situations. I have my car and home. Also my family members came here for insurance as well. You can do everything over the phone, or by email, or even go there in person. All requests are taken care of immediately so how can you beat it? If you need insurance this is a very good choice.
5 I have to say that i have had a lot of time with different Insurance Companies. This one has been one of the better ones.  Since i have a lot to insure, it is a big deal to find a good one. They have insurance for all sorts of veichiles and homes, but not Motor Couches. It is at times hard to find someone or a company to meet all your needs. They do also do life plannning as far as insurance for Death benneys and all. Though they are far away from where i live you can also take care of bussiness on the phone and the internet. It is best to speak to an agent though, because the girl that answers the phone is really a bit unaware of the agency's clients needs. It is  a good cpmpany and has been around for many years.    I think you should give them a try.
5 Its not just about the company but also the agent. Wes Stahler's office has been a great experience. They are responsive and want to understand your needs to ensure you are accurately covered. They even talked to me about products to ensue that I am covered in the future. I not only recommend State Farm but specifically I recommend Wes Stahler's office. Great business to support.
