3 3 stars because I like this place, but it really can be hit & miss. The atmosphere is bright, friendly & really well lit. The food and service can be good at times and only SO SO on others. For fast food it's definitely a step up, but I wish it was a bit more consistent. Try the monthly specials as they are usually creative, fresh and quite tasty.   Anyone have a good set of chopsticks I can borrow?
5 The kids love panda express.  My 9 year old actually complains that they give you too much food. This is pretty much the only non chicken nugget or spaghetti or pizza food that my 5 year old will eat.  And to be honest- I don't mind it either.
1 If I could give negative stars I would. This place sucks. We have eaten here a few times and the service has always been subpar, but this trip takes the cake. We left after 15 minutes standing in line while the only two employees on the floor were making passes at the Pepsi vendor working on the soda fountain. We will not be back to this location, I would rather make the trip to Gilbert were their food is actually fresh and the service isn't terrible.
3 This is panda, you get what you are expecting. The drive-thru is always super fast and I have never had an order filled incorrectly.  My only complaint was that on this visit the orange chicken was clumped together and not as good as normal.  I always order the spring rolls, they're my favorite.
2 We've been this Panda several times. We use the drive thru periodically and every time they claim that one of our items in not ready and we have to go around and wait upfront.  Today was another time when this happened. We were told our food would be ready in 8 minutes. We waited 15 minutes and then finally went inside ....  We found the employees freely serving the item we were waiting for .... And defending the fact that they basically forgot our order. Terrible service ... Drive to a panda somewhere else ... Just not this one.
