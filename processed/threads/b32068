5 Really amazing service, very helpful, & certainly affordable.  The owner really cares, and makes sure everything is to your liking. It's hard to find a body shop that doesn't doesn't cut corners out here.
5 All Team Auto is the only place I let work on my car.  They are honest, hard working and friendly.  I trust them completely.  Their body shop currently has my car as a result of a car accident where I was hit.  They are handling everything with the insurance company which is a huge plus for me. I know the repair work will be outstanding.
5 These guys really care!  With great service and getting the work they've had to get done on my SUV quickly, what more could I have asked for? Also, I honestly didn't (and still don't!) know a thing about cars and was nervous about going into there at first because of some of the unfortunate experiences I've had with the service department at the dealership from where I bought my SUV itself - making me almost give up on it! So the experts at ATA took the time to walk me through the entire process, showed me the problems it was having and gave me their honest assessment. Still untrusting, I compared the pricing of their parts on google and (sure enough!) their price was honest and competitive!
1 Horrible service!!! Came here by accident and they were so rude I couldnt believe it! All sitting around and said it was a 45min wait!! Went right next door to major auto service and peter helped me! He was so polite and nice!
5 Can't explain how happy I am with their service. They only took 45 mins to restore my foggy headlights. I highly recommend this shop!!!!
5 Everyone is always sceptical about auto repair shops. I'm not different either. Well sometimes we just have to have faith in people. TRUST is a must! Today I came here to get brake service. They did a good job. They did everything what they promised. Also they finished the job on time. It was very affordable compared to my car type! I am very happy! The owner, the management, the workers are all very nice and friendly. I used their service before, twice, and I am happy to come back again. Thank you Ron! Thank you All Team!
5 Ron and his team are great! They have affordable prices and excellent service. They even offered to pick me up from home when my car was finished :) This place is now my #1 auto shop and I will refer anyone I know with car problems. Thanks Ron!
5 We needed some bumper/headlamp repair on husbands car. Nothing to major but other places quoted us crazy prices. All Team collision took care of us for a more then fair price!! Kept us updated daily either via text or phone call, which was great because there's nothing worse then sitting at home wondering impatiently,when and what's going on with your car!!! Thank You All Team Collision!!
5 Super friendly and quick great service. Definitely recommend.
5 Anytime I have car problems I bring my car to All Team Auto, I get great customer service, they always fix my car for a good price. I would recommend any of my friends to come here for there auto needs.
3 3.5 stars if possible.  I've come here before for repair work done and the first time they did a great job. The gentleman behind the desk is very polite and gives explanations for everything.  The past time I've visited my check engine light was on showing the P0401 code, for insufficient EGR flow. They inspected my vehicle and then quoted me for two possible solutions for a clog in my intake manifold. The first solution was a $270 fix and it was to add a chemical to dissolve the clog and as time goes by the problem would be fixed. The second solution was a staggering $1200 fix to replace the WHOLE manifold.  So, I took the cheaper route and got the chemical solution which ended up feeling like a huge mistake. I was told that the check engine light would keep coming on as long as the chemical was working. However my registration was coming up and after three seperate visits of approximately 200 miles, the issue was not resolved.  The next day I visited another mechanic on the opposite side of town and was quoted $160 for him to take apart the whole manifold and deep clean it. After much mental debating I decided to get it done. Needlessto say the chemical All Team Auto provided me with did not get the job done, however it slightly softened the clog, however it was nowhere near strong enough to penetrate the clog.   I'm pretty glad I got a second opinion, however even though All Team Auto's chemical did not work for my vehicle, it has improved the performance a bit. I would say that it's a $270 liquid tune-up!  The team is great, however second opinions are always smart and I will probably return for basic maitenence since the location is convenient.
2 After spending more than $1600 at All Team Auto Repair and Collision, here is why I will never do business with them again:  1. I paid upfront to ensure replacement parts would arrive when car scheduled to be repaired. 2. The parts didn't arrive in time. 3. When parts finally arrived, they weren't inventoried. Turns out that still not all parts arrived. 4. Finally, repair reportedly "completed".  5. When I arrived, car not fully repaired as I expected. Informed only when I came to pick up car that they could not fix a part, but would require more money to order new part to fully repair it ($800+). They should have told me this information on the phone so I wouldn't arrive expecting a complete repair. 6. Also repair on car was shoddy. Bumper not aligned properly. Chalky substance in cracks and crevices around car. White powder on carpet in trunk. White fingerprints on bumper. Outside of car not cleaned, but rinsed, leaving large water spots on glass and body.  7. I was also informed by one of the mechanics that parts were "after factory" and that's why bumper didn't align properly. I paid for new parts. Manager reprimanded mechanic and assured me that all installed parts are new. 8. I'm still not happy with the way bumper is aligned.  9. Still wonder what white substance was if parts installed are new. I will find out though using another body shop and then respond accordingly. 10. I do need to mention that the paint job looks pretty good. There were still some slight scratch marks on the part replaced, but I'm not really picky about that as long as paint lasts.  Good luck to you if you choose to use All Team Auto Repair and Collision. You will never see me there again though.
5 I had a dent in my lift gate and came to All Team to get it fixed.  They did an awesome job, the car looks good as new, the price was incredibly reasonable, and they got it done super quickly.  They were also super nice, I mainly dealt with Alex and he was great.  I was very happy with their service, would highly recommend them, and will definitely use them again in the future!
5 My friend had a car accident and they worked with her to keep everything in her budget.  I was so impressed with the service that I brought my '01 Saturn in to get the fan fixed.  They did everything in a quick time and even stayed open late on saturday to get me my car when I was running late.  I would go there again.
5 I have been coming here for years. The owner is really great--I found him with a friend when we came to his shop from another one next door where they tried to tell us that his car would be about $2500 to fix.  The owner fixed it for about $40.  I never feel like I'm being pressured...there really isn't any upsell, unless something truly needs to be fixed.  Highly recommend!
4 Catching up on my reviews; this review is for service received last March (03/10/2014).  My SUV had started making vibrating noises on sharp left turns, caused by the front left bumper brushing against the tire as the result of having been pushed in somehow.  (Apparently a parking lot hit, sigh).  Stopped by All Team Auto body shop as had driven by it often and asked to have it looked at; was pleased to hear that rather than having to replace the entire bumper, they could pull it back away from the tire using their equipment. Total cost was 220, less than I expected to pay since I thought the entire bumper might need to be replaced.  Service was excellent and they test drove the car to make sure the vibrations were gone etc.  Appreciated their honesty in not trying to talk me into replacing the entire bumper.  Based on this service, decided to try their adjacent auto repair service (All Team Auto supplies both auto body AND auto repair service).  Will submit separate review for the auto repair services.
