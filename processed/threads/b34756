5 Excellant service by people who care.
5 Staff is professional and knowledgeable, they care about you and why you are there.
5 I've had several occasions over the years to use different physical therapy locations. WOW--this is in a completely different category than all the others.  I met with Nicole Evans (owner) initially for my prescriptive exercises, and each time after I worked with a therapist, Nicole always ended the session with a massage of my knee to check progress and talk with me.  The room is much smaller than I have previously had, with fewer patients scheduled in at one time.  There are always several therapists to guide and help you.  I was not only impressed, but simply amazed!
5 I have been coming to Tru for a few weeks for PT.  Thanks to Pam L. who I met at the Barre3 CMYE, I learned about Tru right when I got prescribed PT by my doctor.  It is very convenient for me (a few minutes' drive from home) and they are open 7 AM to 7 PM  several days a week.  I have made 5 PM appointments every time and have been able to leave work, change at home, and make it here on time.  I see Tarah as recommended by Pam L. and she is wonderful.  The whole staff is very nice and it is a collaborative effort during sessions here.  I feel comfortable here, and the background music in here is really good too!  The price is reasonable since I have not met my deductible and pay for all medical expenses out of pocket.  I have learned great exercises to do at work as well to prevent injury and hopefully heal more quickly.  I recommend Tru if PT is an option for you.
