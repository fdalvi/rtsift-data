5 Found this place at the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort (I live in town). These ladies do it all, they have a full salon and do a great job, offer nail services and waxing services (Bonnie was very friendly and professional).   They also offer every kind of massage there is - I'll be back for sure!   I was a walk-in and they took care of me with little delay but I think I will make an appointment next time as I can see this place being busy.
5 the staff was so friendly and welcoming and the massage therapist really helped with the knots I've been having in my back!  She was so helpful and the massage was extrmely relaxing that I practically fell asleep.  Graat spa, will be back!
5 I live in a near by community and I have been going to this spa for many years.  The staff is absolutely the best from the desk personnel (Michelle and Ali) to the spa technicians (Courtney, Patsy and Bella).  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wishes to be treated to a special experience.
5 Had a massage and it was fabulous.  I asked for deep tissue, and it definitely was.  David, the masseur, did a great job!  I've also had eyebrow wax and haircuts and everything has been great.  They have a membership for AZ residents too!
