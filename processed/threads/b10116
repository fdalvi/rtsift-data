3 This store is located in Las Vegas Airport.  They carried a large selection of Ladies Belts, Handbags, Watches, Jewelry, Eyewear, Western Belts, Luggage and someFootwear.   Lots of silver and gold, crystals and bright colors.  The store is well kept and staff are nice.
4 Always love this place, I like going in and checking out their purses, clutches, belts, and even their jewelry.  I know they have stores at most malls but I don't always make a effort to go in.  I know I can always find a store at most airports, and to help time pass, it's fun to check out the goodies.  Today, I was surprised to find a fillet barrette for the hair, silver of course and reasonably priced.  A few years back, I obtained one of their charm bracelets with proceeds going to breast cancer support.  It's quality is impeccable, as is this barrette.  I know it will last a long time.    The staff were courteous and took the time to carefully wrap my purchase.  Nice little store.
4 Love this Brighton! Well, not sure how many are in the LAS Airport - but I am a fan of the store in Terminal D. I always seem to find myself stopping off in here before my flight departs. Time to give my shoulder a break from my jam packed DVF carry on - sit her down on the floor and browse around. Really, I think it's better than wasting your time and calorie intake snacking around the airport on a bunch of crap. You might as well go hit up some retail shops and through our economy a bone. This is a great little place to do it. The prices are reasonable and the quality of the product is high. They also have a warranty on all pieces. I like their bracelets, necklaces and earrings. The handbag collection, in my opinion is a little "old" not my style but the sterling silver is really cute. I like to mix and match pieces from here all the time. Nice stuff for yourself or as gifts.
