5 So tasty! Love that I can make my panini exactly the way I want it-choosing my meats, cheese, bread, veggies and sauce! YUM:)
5 Gili's Paninis are FANTASTIC!  Made to order as good as it gets!  In addition to having a ton of flavor, mine was hot and fresh!  Gili is super friendly too!  You can really taste the quality he puts into his work.
4 Great Panini.  A friend and I do laps around the square and stopped by for lunch on Tuesday.  Two bread choices...then choose your toppings...meats and cheese.  The salty goodness of green olives appealed to me but I wasn't sure it would really work with my sandwich choice.  I was assured it would.  The Panini was done pretty quickly and was really good.  The lemonade was refreshing.  They are very flexible with the ingredient combinations.  It would be nice if they featured a sandwich of the day for when you want to try something different.  Oh, and they take credit cards which always helps.  I would go there again.
1 The lemonade was good. The panini cost $7.50, took 20 minutes (there were all of 4 people ahead of us), and tasted flavorless and dull, a little like what I would expect licking a dusty shelf would taste like. Never again.
