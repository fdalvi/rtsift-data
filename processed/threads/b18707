3 I don't know that I consider myself an expert on gelato, but I know I have had it while in Rome, and that may just make me a bit more knowledgable than others.  If i had to sum this place up in a word, it'd be "meh".  Lots of flavors, and they had fun little decorations in the flavors (much like the G Spot does), but some of the decorations looked like they had been out a bit too long.   I can't remember the flavor I got, but I remember it being more icey than gelato-y. I was bringing a friend who had never had gelato before (and I had of course been RAVING about it) and I was a little embarassed that this was her first try.  Girls behind the counter were VERY nice, they even asked me to go to azcentral and vote for the store to win something-or-other... I just smiled. I didn't have the heart to tell them that it didn't taste good enough for a vote.   I don't know if their mixing or ingredients are a little off, if they had been sitting out too long, or what, but this was not the traditional gelato I was used to. Texture & flavor did not measure up.
5 Absolutely wonderful!  I actually signed up for yelp to write a nice review for this place.  I am not a big ice cream person, have been to italy and loved thier gelato, but never been a big "oh lets go get gelato" person here.  The point is that the gelato there is amazing, with amazing gourmet flavors that rotate frequently and I think it is family owned.  The employees are all so sweet and make tons of amazing little concoction samples for you before you have a chance to order. Also, I am a student and they give a nice discount.  Try it!
