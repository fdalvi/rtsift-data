4 After raving about this burger time and again, my husband finally took me to get one at his favorite poker spot, Binion's. He said it was hands down the best burger he's ever had, which is a bold statement coming from him. Although he tried not to get my expectations up too high, he couldn't stop talking about it, so I had to see what the fuss was about.  The first time he went he sat at the counter and had the chance to speak with the manager who told him the same man has been forming the burgers by hand for the last 45 years, which is almost as long as McDonald's has been around. The Binion's own ranch used to supply the beef, but now it comes in from elsewhere. We lucked out by not having to wait in line, which can take as long as twenty to thirty minutes during peak times (almost anytime according to my husband, Ian). We went late Sunday afternoon and were able to walk straight up to the register to order, although the place was packed when we got there. A plain burger costs $4.95 and a cheeseburger costs $5.95, fantastic deals considering what some burgers are going for these days, like the kobe burger with fois gras that costs upwards of $70 at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar in Mandalay Place. Ian's argument for this being the best burger is that you don't need anything special to make it taste better. He likes his burgers with cheese and only cheese, which allows him to judge burgers based on just three components - meat, bun, and cheese. Binion's Burger hits on all three cylinders. You can see the meat glisten with its own juices and fat as it sits perched on a soft and yeasty bun that tastes like the dinner rolls they used to serve at Tony Roma's. The cheese just barely sweats as it clings to the burger without running off and leaving you with a translucent film of what used to be cheese. Although I like my burgers with all the fixins, I have to agree with Ian; it's a damn good burger and definitely one of the best I've had, too.  The menu is simple but not limited to burgers, and everything is made from scratch in house. I didn't see a single person that didn't have a burger in front of them, however, so I can't vouch for the rest of the menu. The burger comes with really good potato salad, but for a dollar more you can sub it out for another form of potato, french fries. Both were great so it really just depends on what you're in the mood for. I don't like to encourage Ian to go to casinos, but in this case, I'll have to make an exception.  Tip: If you're looking for a really good deal but don't feel like a burger, head to Benny's Bullpen bar where you can get a sixteen inch pizza and a pitcher of beer for $10. Valid Mon-Fri from 5PM to 1AM and 10AM to 1AM Saturday and Sunday.
3 Being a poker fan I'd heard about the Binions Cafe and that is was pretty good (good food reasonably priced).  A few years I read a book, Positively 5th Street (which the author enters and does well at the world series of poker) where he raves about the food at Binions.  Anyways if you are in the mood for greasy food at good prices check out the Binion's cafe.  I ordered a grill cheese with ham.  What i ended up getting was like nothing I imagined.  I received a sandwich stuff with tons of super greasy ham and cheese (tons of greese!).  Despite the fact that it probably took a couple months off my life the meal wasn't bad.  I was a bit hung over so my body actually appreciated this meal.  Binion's to me is almost a historic site.  It's somewhat painful to see them move away the world series of poker, then shut down the hotel rooms....my hope is that the casino and food establishments aren't the next to go because that would indeed be a sad sad day....
3 Okay.... Disclaimer ... I only go to this place after long night of Downtown fun so the food might not be as amazing as I think it is .. but hey, If you're hungry, you want good quality greasy dinerish food at 3 am, Binion's cafe delivers. The staff is fantastic! They are pretty fast and they re-fill your water cups without even asking. Bless their hearts.
4 Gamblers Breakfast!   Believe it or not that sign brought me to this place...  Envision it...you are in Downtown Vegas, hungry and do not know where to go...actually I was starving.   There are all those signs hanging on the casinos on Fremont Street for meal deals...most of them you need to either be a member of their casino club or there is some huge line to get into the restaurant itself.  Oh yeah, its also 1am.    We decided to try Binion's Cafe since it was central and there was not a wait.  It seemed like a regular little coffee shop situated in the middle of a casino.  The wait staff was veryyyy friendly...totally funny at that.  I ordered an omelette with two cheeses, sausage and bacon.  The omelette itself was overflowing with ingredients...there were a few stray onions in it which I really hate but I was able to pick them out.  It came with hashbrown potatoes which were not totally amazing but were acceptable.  It would have been a three star experience but my wife had a Belgium waffle which she proclaimed was the "best Belgium waffle she had ever eaten".  So one extra star for that amazing waffle.  If I am hungry in Downtown Vegas I would not have a problem eating here again.  Big tip:  You can park in the garage at Binion's free with validation.  Make sure when you validate you validate AT BINIONS.  We accidentally validated at one of the neighboring casinos and when we went to leave the parking garage the guy working actually noticed that it was a stamp from another casino and made us pay.  It was an honest mistake and he was kind of an ass in his approach to the situation.   Oh well.     :0)
2 burger was okay, french fries were salty.  good for the price.  and not too bad for Fremont street.
2 So you've been walking up and down fremont street a couple of times getting drunk off the fat tuesday in your hand and suddenly the sign you passed at least 5 times begins to sound appealing to you "$4.95 burger and fries at Binions cafe".  I'd say the best time to go to this cafe is when you've been drinking, it's late, you're hungry, and you could give a shit about the the cigarette smell, the service, or the taste.   Stumble in here during your "fremont experience", seat yourself, order off the sticky menu, find a filled bottle of ketchup from a nearby empty table and enjoy your meal. Who cares what it tastes like, it's food.
3 So a buddy decided to show us "OLD" Vegas on this recent trip and with nothing else going on we decided to follow. Fortunately he knew his way around and we parked in the Binion's Parking. So since we were doing it old style it is all about the saving right?   ***"Old Vegas" (OV)Hint 1*** take your parking stub with you so that you can get it stamped down in the casino for free parking.  We walked into a very old Casino and I had to stop and pay homage to the old card players in the Poker Hall of Fame.   ***OV Hint 2*** stop by the Binion's Million, a stack of bills totalling 1 Million dollars incased in plexiglass but perfect for posing for a free picture. The picture takes about 30 minutes to print up which I am sure the Casino hopes you will spend at their tables. We spent it walking around Freemont Street and then going to Binion's Cafe.  So my friend remembered having an awesome steak and eggs one time while visiting Binion's so we followed.  Well it turns out that the Cafe has moved from the old cavernous space decorated with animal heads hanging from the walls to a little cafe in middle of the casino, almost an after thought.   It was a bit crowded so we waited a few minutes for a table to empty and grabbed it before it was bussed. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg?select=lA9nWp16Lj6pHB_qoRF0mQ  ***OV Hint 3***If you want to have a beer or drink with your meal in the Cafe, get it from the bar and bring it in with you. They won't say anything but you can't order a beer in the Cafe.  So we peruse the menu and no "Steak and Eggs" so my buddies decide on the Binion Burgerhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg?select=cCzVZ6L_J8ietdkCrIchdg a chili dog http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg?select=zTGBaFOCbwWRs5gK2THNIQ and I had a craving for suasage and gravy http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg?select=kWyQ2e-54FlIcN8v4t0V-w  All in all the food was what you would expect for a 4.00 burger, 3.00 chili dog and 2.00 biscuits and gravy.   Decent cheap and as fast as you can expect.   I would say that the highlight of the dining experience was the sassy and borderline rude server. She made it feel like we were really in Old Vegas.
4 If you are looking for a good burger, this is definitely the place.  Sitting at the counter is a MUST to get the entire experience of this old school counter burger and fries. I'l  definitely be going back!
3 This place looks like how I imagined all Vegas cafes to look. My bf and I both ordered the binions cheeseburger. I didnt let myself order the bacon.. trying to cut back.  I ate my burger sans 1 bun - and it was really good. It had good flavor but the pickles they use are sweet... not my kinda of deal. Served open face.  They are very big on RED ONION here.  SIDES: My cheeseburger came with potato salad.. sounded like a good idea @ the time.. I asked if it had onion to which she quickly said no.  it had MORE ONION THAN POTATO. ah well calories saved I always say.   2 burgers with water $13.00 - not bad considering most places on the strip charge $13 for a single burger.. .much less 2.   Would I eat here again, yes but I'd get the $6.00 cobb salad nxt time. :)  They also have several specials for card holders, neither my bf or I are b/c we NEVER win @ Binions so we never go there. . ok we go there hoping to win and we dont. .
1 Stay away! I stopped by for breakfast one morning, there were no specials. I ordered a coffee and country fried steak and eggs. The coffee was like brown water, I couldn't even take a second drink of it. When I got my order the country fried steak was tough, the eggs that I ordered scrambled were runny and the hash browns were raw. The waiter was cool and offered me something else but I didn't want to eat there. He took the charge off. I won't go back here to eat, Magnolias in the four queens is superior in food and with a club card the country fried steak and eggs is $2 less!
3 Ok so it was late and we were hungry. Signed up for the Binions casino card to get a discount on food. The draw was the hangover breakfast burger. I skipped it and went for the chicken fried steak and eggs. My daughter had the hangover burger, and the wife had a regular cheese burger. My chicken fried steak was 6.95 with my card and let me tell you it was a real hand breaded chicken fried steak! I saw the cook making it. It was real beef and came with a pretty decent home made cream gravy. Top that off with some fresh fried eggs cooked right and some real hash browns and you got a meal(or a heart attack). The Hangover burger was a burger with topped with a fried egg, 2 slices of bacon and 2 slices of cheese. It came with fries. My daughter said it was great but a too much to finish. The regular cheese burger my wife had was fresh and juicy with a nice melted american cheese on it. It came with a potato salad she said was very good. Service?  Not much to speak of but hey it is cheap killer (literally) food. I was very surprised at the quality. Much more home made than expected.
4 Block rockin' classic burgers, the beef is ground fresh on site and you can tell. Fries with the skin on, and refills coming at rapid fire pace made this 24 hour spot a hit. Also had a bite of the chili part of a chile cheese dog with some fries, made for some crispy gooey goodness. I would have no problem ordering the chili on it's own and maybe spiking it up with some hot sauce. I don't know if they offer chili cheese fries on the menu, if they don't, they should-yeah that good. Back to the burger...it's a whopping 1/2 pound of ground there- ground beef. Not only does that insure a fresh flavor, it also insures that you are not being fed "pink slime" (google it-nasty stuff) like most other burger places. Burger is served on a nice sturdy and moist bun with all the classic toppings.  Binion's Cafe makes all food that is terrible for you.... oh so downtown delish.
5 Alright, I asked a friend that works for the MGM where in town could I get an awesome burger. He told me to go check out Binion's Cafe. So, I did and WOW!   This is the best burger in Las Vegas. I ordered a double with cheese and all the fixings and it was awesome. I had french fries with it along with a coke. The service was decent with the waiter keeping my soda glass full. The food didn't take a long time considering the burgers are cooked to order.   Being a local I avoid downtown/the strip like the plague but when I do go down there for now on, I have to grab one of these great burgers. Yeah, the burgers are that good!  Oh and the casino will validate your parking.
4 Great service, super prices, and friendly, attentive wait staff.  Angela, one of the waitresses, is an absolute doll.   :-)  We will definitely be back.
5 Oh how I do love Old Town.  This is yet another gem - 24 hour joint with great burgers!  I think the food there tastes best at 4am, but that is just my opinion.
4 I was pleasantly surprised.  We needed a quick lunch before heading back to a conference and this fit the bill.  Quickly seated and serviced.  The burgers were great and drinks were promptly refilled.
1 AWFUL! This place needs to be shut down by the health department. We waited almost an hour for our meals and they only showed up when we got up to walk out. Plastic plates, plastic silverware and styrofoam cups, WTF!?!? Our food was COLD, no wonder.. If it had been under a heat lamp the plastic plate would have melted! Watched a server try to re-heat fries in a metal bucket under a non-warm heat lamp then serve them.  This place needs to be shut down.
5 It was late into the night or maybe early in the morning..i had to get more energy to play at the historic Binion's Poker room.    i ordered  the 2 egg breakfast,nothing fancy, all I wanted was a little picker upper and that certainly hit the spot. It was good-no complaints.  I really loved our waitress; The waitress was very friendly and helpful with the menu and recommendations. She really was extra awesome when it came to blasting my toast with mounds of butter; who the hell likes dry toast? Also I got water  but I  mentioned something to my spouse about Orange juice and I guess my big mouth was over heard by the waitress and WA-LA she brought me an OJ . NOW THAT IS SERVICE
5 This is a 4.5 star review, but the hispanic woman behind the counter was so nice to us, that I am upping it to 5 stars. We sat at the counter, and service was quick, with just the right amount of checking up with us. Definitely not the Ritz in terms of surroundings, but good grub when you are hungry at 3am, after winning your first poker tournament (sorry, I had to brag even though it was only a 20 person tournament, but I gotta live my only poker moment in history). My pastrami sandwich was very good, and I was delighted when I ordered extra cheese, and the ratio of meat to cheese was just perfect for this cheese lover. I wish they would of had fancy delicatessen mustard, but nevertheless, I enjoyed that sandwich.They served my sandwich with potato salad and sweet pickles. The sweet pickles were store bought, but I never had sw pickles with a sandwich other than tuna fish before, and I kinda liked it. I took the rest of my sandwich home and ate it for a quick bite in the morning. The price of the food was good, but it wasn't as cheap as their specials. I know one of their specials was for a chili dog meal, and can't remember the others, and I recall thinking they were pretty good deals, especially compared with the prices back home. I would definitely drop in again when on Fremont Street. PS Tip the waitress well if she does a good job for you. We saw her counting out change from the tip jar, and it was a lot of coins. I think a lot of locals come and eat here, even possible homeless people, so I bet she dosen't get the tips she deserves.   Binion's does charge for parking, but you get the first 3 hours free with validation, or you can stay all night if you get your ticket validated if you play in their poker room. Also, I am not familiar with all the different parking options on Fremont St., but I found their parking lot convenient for access to the main strip (puts you almost directly in the middle of the action). But, one of the 4 times we had to use the small elevator to the parking garage, the elevator took about 5 minutes, the rest of the times it wasn't too long of a wait.
5 I haven't stopped talking about this place since I went last week.  I walked into this place with no idea what to expect and a bogo coupon in hand. It's a typical diner style place- plopped in the  middle of a saggy casino.  It smells of smoke- the serve drinks in styrofoam cups- the menus are slapped down in front of you. It has all the ingredients to make you want to run out- but it's WONDERFUL.  We sat at the counter- received overly zealous service and were fed quickly. The Burgers?? Well in  one word- PERFECT! Freshly ground beef (never frozen) crisp lettuce, tomato onion and pickle on the side. Perfectly toasted bun and french fries.  We got some mayo packets on the side and were in HEAVEN. I have literally been thinking about the best BURGER I have ever had since I left. I should have eaten it a couple more times before I left.  These aren't the modern fancy pants burgers you can get now a days at so many 'Burger Joints'- this is the classic- thin patty- great meat- fresh veggies and buttered bun. Our bill with the BOGO and drinks and fries (that's a buck extra) came to $11- we left a $20 and made the servers day- She was fantastic!
5 When I'm in Vegas I can't resist the urge to sit at the counter at Binion's.  It's old Las Vegas at it's best.  A little dirty-yes, seedy even-yes, amazing-hell yes.   A cheap burger, an old school counter, it doesn't get better. The people are always friendly (Especially Michelle behind the counter) and the regulars (Chin and Louis I'm loooking at you) are quick to make conversation. You must sit at the counter, after one visit you'll already be feeling like a regular.
5 What a change! I used to eat here quite often when the poker room was doing their promos back in 2010. Anti-social behavior and bad social skills is just something you expect in Las Vegas, but I still get irritated by it. The staff here had typical vegas-style awful service back then but times have changed.    When I came here yesterday, I noticed that they had restaffed the whole place. Back in 2010, you had to wait awkwardly at the counter for like 10 minutes before some really messed up looking woman would incoherently whisper at you "uuuhhh I be a coming you with you soon to order take you".  This time it was far better. The woman who took my order was very friendly, took my order promptly, made me feel like Binion's appreciated my business, and she could actually articulate a full sentence!  The food was also very good. I got the Philly Cheesesteak. It was the best Philly I have ever had outside of Philly. My friend got the Burger and he enjoyed it as well. The coffee was also very mild, which I like. I get really sick of how places try to make the coffee too strong by burning it. The coffee at Binions was exactly what I wanted.   I gotta say that "Binion's Cafe" is the best 24 hour food in all of downtown. Golden Nugget has a good 24hour restaurant but they charge like $15 just for 2 eggs and toast. In terms of value and food quality, I think Binions is far better. It's most definitely better than that "Lanai Express" where they try to trick you by selling you dog food and labeling it as "orange chicken".   The things I like the best about Binion's is how efficient the staff is. Most casinos, even places like the Wynn and Red Rock have staff that don't know how to run the comp card in the system. Here at Binions, you hand them your comp card and they charge you the right amount instantly and you are done. Much more efficiency then other casinos.
2 The service was slow that our waiter celebrated his 91st bday and got promoted all in the time we had our mediocre burger. I deserve it though, I was too lazy to eat anywhere else.
4 So you are downtown with a grumbly tummy and have been a little over indulgent with the late night night partying and scarfing multiple questionable food items.  You are craving something simple and satisfying.  Welcome to the Cafe.  The menu covers your simple cravings from breakfast to dinner.  My personal favorite is the Binion Burger.  Nicely toasted puffy bun with a well grilled burger patty.  All the toppings are served on the side to allow you build your own personal favorite.  If you want extra anything, just let your waitress know.  The staff here is more than accommodating. This is a nice place to kick back, slow down and enjoy a nice meal.
2 Blech.  Don't be fooled by all of the signs advertising a $6.95 "gamblers breakfast".  When you open the menu you will see that it is actually $8.50 unless you hold a Binions card.  Even at the lower rate it wouldn't be worth it.  Potatoes were sent back because they were too cold.  Scrambled eggs weren't very scrambled.  Bacon paper thin, sausage patti small.    One star breakfast.  Two stars because the service was decent.
4 The food here is surprisingly delicious! the burgers and cheese steaks are great! its really cheap too! i will definitely be back the next time im in the area.
2 Sometimes you're just in the mood for some cheap, greasy, & smokey diner food... that's exactly what you get at BinionsCafe.  Small open diner in the middle of the casino floor. Definitely an older crowd both patrons and servers. The food was average and don't be fooled with the adversited "low prices." They only apply if you're carry a Binion card. Nothing to write home about but everything you'd expect from to in an old Casino.
4 Came to the bar and ordered a "likiliki" drink - super fruity cocktail in one of those big long cups!   We are in Vegas, minus well enjoy it and party like a rockstar! Party like a rockstar! ;)
3 Gambler's breakfast!  How do I like my burger? With egg of course!  I will give you this warning though, if you get lured in by the cheap food ads they have outside their casino, just know that those are club member prizes. No frets though, they let you sign up at the cafe. I didn't have to give my real name last time LOL
3 menu is quite weak, especially for dinner, but it gets the job done. the grilled ham and cheese was very salty, but my buddy had the club sandwich, which he said was really good. the service is quick, and the staff, in general, are positive and friendly. if staying at the four queens, you get a coupon book with a 2-for-1 meal at the binion's cafe, which would probably be the only reason for coming back.
4 It's extremely small and tucked away in an old casino, but you really can't go to Vegas without partying on Fremont St. all night and then getting the country fried steak at Binions Cafe when you're drunk as hell.
5 Get a players card, get a nice discount. They serve coffee in giant styrofoam cups, so you can take them to go. Solid cafe food. The server will even sign you up for a binion's card if you need it.
4 The Binion's coffee house restaurant (now closed) was the best ever.  There are shades of that restaurant in the cafe.  I'm addicted to the hangover burger (despite not being hung over). It's really indulgent--a fried egg on top of a cheeseburger--but heck, it's Vegas.
3 After a very long couple of nights in Vegas, we ambled into the Binion's Cafe when we saw all the signs hanging outside advertising some super cheap grub.  Well, once we get in there we realize that super cheap grub isn't as enticing as we thought  AND all the breakfast stuff was actually pretty expensive (I had no idea those prices were if you had the Binion card which I never saw posted anywhere, just read it on Yelp!)   Regardless, this place was hard on our already nauseous and fatigued bodies.  The water was sweet for some reason, the soup had the strangest looking chunks, the potato salad looked so unappetizing that my friend had to cover it with a napkin to eat her grilled cheese.  Despite the whole place just exuding an unappetizing air, my eggs and bacon were fine (hashbrowns were pretty bad though.)  Lots of toast, cheap Vegas breakfast places hook you up hardcore on the toast.   I also couldn't tell why some things were served in plastic (salad, soup) but some things on a real plate (my breakfast.)  It was almost worth eating here because we've gotten alot of laughs from discussing how grossed out we were by that meal (partially because of the place itself and partially because we were hung the fuck over.)
3 I love me some diners food and since it was on the afternoon of our return home and we where basically broke, the prices lured us in.   I have to admit it wasn't the nicest of joints I've eaten in but the service makes up for it along with the prices.   My boyfriend and my friend both ordered the Club Sandwiches while I was trying to nurse an upset stomach with some french onion soup.  The sandwiches looked delicious and actually was such a large portion they had to ask for too go boxes, I on the other hand basically just had the broth and crackers since it was not the french onion soup I expected, there was at least a whole onion sliced up in my bowl ( sorta looked like worms) but the broth was good.   The breakfast special sound very appealing so maybe when I'm back in December this will be our breakfast spot on Fremont Street.
3 It's about 2pm, and we (We being my Girlfriend, a friend of hers and myself) were hanging around Freemont when we got hungry as none of us had breakfast.  Our Vegas weekend was on it's final leg which means most of our $$$ was practically gone and the prices here seemed to fit our budget just right.  Being as we were all hungry for breakfast the Hangover Burger looked very appetizing and I almost ordered the Gambler's Breakfast but there is something about Club Sandwich that made me order otherwise.    The cafe seemed a bit small but the Service was good and made up for it.  Our waitress was really friendly and the prices for the food were very reasonable (even if you are not a Club member). I look forward to coming back and trying out the Hangover Breakfast Burger!  .
2 The food was very good, tasty and filling. The bad service is the major issue here that is what is unacceptable!  We were walking down Fremont headed to Du-Par's as we were in the mood for shrimp cocktail when we saw a sign at Binion's advertising their 4.95 burger in the cafe and it looked good as it stated fresh ground meat daily.   We are seated and the service was prompt we placed our order and got our drinks and food and started grubbing. However not really much of any service as our food was dropped and our server never returned other than with the check at the end. What if I had wanted a refill which I always do! Ugh  The hamburger was very tasty and was dress your own burger style with lettuce, onion, tomato, mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard on the side.  The burger comes with a delicious red potato salad which was a nice treat or you can have fries for 1.50 more.  The low two star rating is for the bad service we received while dining and from the cashier as we were headed there to pay for meal.   There was a Cashier stand towards the entrance/exit area of the cafe that we were headed to with bill in hand. As we were walking towards it this African American lady, (did not catch her name) grabs my boyfriend's arm tight and pulls him back saying she is on break come up here and pay. He was in shock, I did not see it because I was still in the process of walking to the cashier at the front exit. All I hear is my boyfriend hollering at me to come here and I see him at the other cashier looking puzzled. We have never dined at a restaurant and been manhandled, this was nuts!  As we are walking out my boyfriend grabs his arm and tells me what just took place. He was in serious shock from what just happened. He works as a person in charge at a well known restaurant and says he would never do what she did to a customer. It was totally out of line and inappropriate to say the least, that lady had no damn sense!  What she did was uncalled for and not professional. Yeah like we are really going to dine and dash on a 12.00 tab, if I was going to do that we would not have ordered a 4.95 special!  It was an honest mistake by walking to the wrong cashier station, how in the hell are we supposed to know she is on break?  I have left a voice mail message for Doug the Cafe Supervisor. I am waiting on a call back.
1 After many attempts to issue a complaint about the horrible service we received I have officially given up reaching Doug the Cafe Supervisor. They just don't care or give a shit is how I take it so Binion's Cafe can piss off!
4 FOOD: 4/5 Belgian Waffle: Not Belgian, but delicious, especially with the whipped butter they provide. Easily one of the best waffles I've ever had.  Breakfast Burger: Tasty and satisfying.  Ham & Cheese Omelette: The eggs were well cooked, the ham tasted fresh, and the cheese was fine. It needed salt, though.  Hash Browns: Limp, greasy, and too garlic-y.  SERVICE: 5/5 Staff is friendly and attentive. They never let my drink fall below the halfway-full point.  ATMOSPHERE: 4/5 Interior: This cafe is in one of the most popular casinos downtown, so it's loud, of course, especially with the loudest games going just feet from your table. But it's quaint and isn't cramped. Typical diner decor.  Cleanliness: No obvious reason for complaint. All appeared to be clean.  PRICE: 5/5 Cheap -- can't be beat! And if you play some games first, there's a good chance you can get your meal comped. We play an hour or so of video blackjack each day and then never have to pay anything for food here.  FINAL NOTES Great little diner, especially late at night. Possibly the best "fast food" option on Fremont.
4 Suprisingly great for what it is -- a coffee shop / 24 hour cafe on Fremont.  Hangover burger is great -- it might be a heart attack on the plate, but its quite good. I also like their buns -- they're not just standard burger buns, but something much tastier.  The Belgian waffle was surprisingly good, although not really a belgian waffle -- more like a traditional american waffle.  The american cheese and ham omelette was nothing to write home about -- edible but not interesting or exceptional. It wasn't terrible by any stretch of the imagination, but its definitley not memorable.  One of my favorites for decent, good cheap food, and a great place to burn your food comps at Binions.
5 Great Burgers! Great casino girls! Love those cowgirl outfits on the dealers. Service was not super fast, but food came out hot and delicious. Small little diner right off the gaming floor. Nothing fancy, just good old fashioned comfort chow. Chicken fried steak looked GREAT
3 Alright so we were downtown Fremont enjoying a fun date night out and happened to smell the burgers a sizzling over at Binion's cafe. We were hungry and  remembered the yummy burger we had last time. Our service and experience from the previous visit was horrendous and we decided to give the Cafe another shot! We decided to stroll through and check out the wait and to our surprise there was no line and plenty of open seats.  We grabbed a seat at the bar and were greeted by the main cook who is Awesome! He took really good care of us all of the way through, kept our drinks filled and even chatted with us for a bit.  The burgers were delicious and our tab was low so you can't beat that with a stick!  I am pleased to announce our visit was much better this time around so we will be back for burgers!
1 I'll keep this one short and sweet since it doesn't deserve the full treatment based on what you get. As many of my frequent readers probably know, I recently moved my office to the downtown area which opened up an opportunity to try out a whole slew of new places. Today's review comes from a tip a regular Twitter friend sent me for a supposed hidden cheap gem at Binion's Café. Cheap it was, good it wasn't.  Binion's Café is located right in the middle of the smoky casino floor, completely open to the noise of the slots and savory Fremont St patrons. The somewhat defined space is a seat yourself, free for all of two and four top tables, as well as a small diner-style counter facing the kitchen. This is definitely not a place for ambiance or fresh smells. I went for lunch on a random weekday and it was totally packed. The 24 hour menu features appetizers, soups, salads, burgers, sandwiches and many breakfast items. There is a hangover breakfast burger on the menu that comes topped with a fried egg, 2 bacon strips, 2 slices of American cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and sweet pickle for $9.75, but that sounded like a bit much for me as I was not hung over for this meal.  Instead I went with the $4.95 Binion's Burger with some Swiss cheese. I can't even explain this burger in much detail, but will instead give you this analogy: if you put this burger in a side-by-side blind taste test with a McDonald's angus burger, it would probably lose. The generic, dry, foul tasting pre-made patty was hard to stomach, the sweaty cheese was barely melted and too salty, and the previously frozen tomatoes seemed barely ripe. The bun was fairly fresh, flaky and grilled, but too thin and did nothing to save this burger. The generic frozen fries were cooked ok, but didn't taste great and were also nothing to speak of. My $4.95 burger meal quickly escalated to $10.84 with the addition of cheese, fries and an iced tea. Going back to the McDonald's comparison, you would do better there for far less.
3 24 hour cafe inside the Binion's casino. Service is slow even when it's late and there are barely any customers there. Food is decent and what you expect given the location and price. They give you plastic utensils and then never come back once you get your food, except to give you the bill. The thing I like about the cafe being in the middle of the casino is that people in your group can still go gamble while you're waiting for your food since there are a lot of machines located right in front of the tables. If you have a players card, they have some late night specials that you can order from.
4 Hangover Burger and Gambler's breakfast.  Dirt cheap and tasty.  To get the discount you have to sign up and get a free Binion's gambling card.
1 I left my expensive ray-bans on the table after eating at binion's cafe. When i returned 10 minutes later for the sun glasses, they weren't there and the waiter that served us was not to be seen. Very disappointing.
2 In days of yore, a trip wasn't complete without a visit to Binion's for the bean soup, but much gas has been passed since our last visit. We each ordered a bowl of this day's black-eyed bean and ham soup that was accompanied by a generous portion of corn bread. The soup was under seasoned and the corn bread was dry due to over baking, so much for nostalgia.
2 This cafe is located on the main casino floor of Binions Hotel and Casino in Fremont Street, Las Vegas.  I had the pulled pork sandwich, which was more like a bbq sauce sandwich with pulled pork garnish.  But hey, at least they toasted the bun.    The price seemed a little stiff at close to $8.  But the coffee is good and strong.  All in all, not a place I'm likely to return to, unless it's for a fast cup of joe.

4 Went to the counter here at the cafe for the first time in years and realized how it was missed.  The wait staff were energetic, pleasant and actually seemed to be happy to be there.  It's a greasy spoon diner - had the burger and it was excellent - with a ton of fries for $5.  Deal.  It's been there at Binions for 2,000 years - give it a try - you'll have a good time!
4 This little cafe presented me with my finest culinary surprise during my trip to Vegas  It doesn't look like much and nothing on the menu really sticks out. I ordered a hot pastrami on rye expecting it to be small and dry. It was huge and mouthwatering. They must cook it in-house because I've NEVER had a better pastrami sandwich. I may have had one as good, but never a better one. The sandwich really made my night
4 It's cheap (compared to other casinos), pretty fast and the food is OK.  This place is a greasy spoon diner place in the middle of Binions casino.  Both times we ate here it was very busy, but they move people through very quickly.  No one stands around, everyone is constantly moving and getting things done.  With that said, the staff is friendly and won't rush you if you want to finish your cup of coffee.
5 Classic 'greasy spoon' diner fare at reasonable prices inside the Binion's Casino on Fremont Street.  The Jalapeno Bottle Caps (fried batter dipped sliced jalapeno peppers; $5.75) were freaking AWESOME!  After having a hard time finding any sort of decent (or affordable) food late at night on the Las Vegas Strip, I was pleased to find options like the 24-hour Binion's Cafe in the Fremont Street area of downtown.  They serve just the kind of stuff you'd expect to find at a diner: burgers, sandwiches, salads, and breakfast meals.  Everything here is a pretty good value for Vegas, too: I don't think there was anything on the menu over $10.  I would totally come back here for some greasy breakfast the next time I find myself in downtown Vegas!
2 If this is classic diner food, or a true greasy spoon, I want to give up right now. It's not.  This tiny joint is a couple steps above vending machine.  Yelp swayed me way wrong here - the food is borderline passable in a rush.   Diners or greasy spoons actually prepare food to order and actually have some level of quality. The fact its budget food doesn't really matter, there's still pride and passion.  The staff here seemed to universally hate life - and I get they work in a casino probably harassed by fools all day, but there's a point at which you've given up and are going through the motions.  Order a salad at Binions and it comes in a packaged, pre-made plastic box, same goes for a shrimp cocktail. Order a pulled pork sandwich with fries and the kitchen churns it out in about 180 seconds - and tastes very much like 3 minutes of effort. Ask if you can get a beer, and your surly waiter will grunt, mumble and point to the casino bar before walking away.  Your interaction with this waiter will get no better.  I'm not asking for the earth, I know its a quick cafe and its cheap. But at the minimum I expect a smile, a hello and some quality.
2 The service was good but the food was nasty. Veggies were frozen and overcooked. They looked gray. Steak was not cooked correctly and they did not even offer a new one. I would not suggest this place.
1 25 minutes before the waitress would come to take our order.  While we waited four tables of customers walked out.  Chicken was dry, prime rib was good, pizza was ok.  Don't sit in the back of the restaurant if you want decent service. Not going back there EVER.
1 Food was decent, but the waiter (male) was an ass. Totally rude to me and my two lady friends. Never greeted us just asked what do you want. Then just dropped off the food without ever saying anything. Maybe a "is there anything else I can get you" would have been nice. Then when we needed soda refills we had to ask. The waiter then told us very rudely told us that he doesn't do refills and pointed to a lady and said she does them. What a rude place. When we complain to the lady upfront, she just said "O, sorry"  but nothing changed.
4 Old school restaurant selling steak and eggs s day long. It was but for me but the group I was with enjoyed there meal.
3 Wandered in here after passing numerous signs advertising a chili dog and fries for $3.95. It's free for all seating, and we had to flag down a waitress to get menus. The food wasn't fantastic, but it was good. I had the chicken strip plate and was impressed at how juicy they were for diner food. Overall? A good spot for late night/early morning hunger! You can't beat the price.
4 Perfect place for a truly classic breakfast. We've eaten here twice on this Vegas trip, but plan on at least one more breakfast at Binion's Cafe. I got the Binion's special both days, and for Vegas, I'd consider it pretty cheap. Husband had the Benny's special and the chicken fried steak and eggs. All were exactly what we were looking for. If you want classic diner breakfast that transports you to small town Wisconsin/Minnesota diners, come here. Eat. Be happy.
4 Prices are good and portions are great. I almost couldn't finish all my food. I've been here for breakfast and dinner and was satisfied with both my visits! The staff was very friendly and you don't have to wait very long for your food. Will most likely return in the future.
5 After walking around Freemont, the hubby and I needed some some fuel. We stepped into the casino and took advantage of the $2 corona special that day! We then made our way to the cafe, we figured the buffet while inexpensive and pretty sizable was just to much for us right then. Upon scanning the menu, we decided to both give the NY strip steak meal a whirl. I believe it was around 14-15 bucks. I gotta say it was a great piece of steak, the seasoning was just right and it was super tender! I was impressed indeed plus we were able to order another one of those cheap coronas in the cafe :) the service here was excellent! Our server Molly was super sweet and attentive to our dining needs! Good spot in the old strip to get a cheap delicious meal!
1 The "fat" African American "black lady" that is the cashier at this cafe is so freaking rude with no customer service at all! Management has to train her ass in customer service! She literally told us to fu*k off and go get a club card which is stupid because we both had our player cards. Then she proceeded to tell us how fu*king stupid we were for not showing our cards to our waiter which was total bullsh*t cause the waiter did see our cards and marked it down that we had our player cards to get the discount! She was the one that made the mistake and refuses to admit up to it!!!!!!! The waiters were wonderful but with a stupid ass cashier like that kills everything!! I saw more than a few people refusing to tip their waiters because the cashier was demanding tips from the customers!! Stupid ass lady, the tips are for the waiters who work their ass off to serve us the customers; while your stupid lazy ass isn't doing jack sh*t to receive tip! I hope that the management does something about this! We asked for a manager and was told there was none on duty!!!! WTF?!?! how the fu*k can u not have a manager on duty?!?!? Seriously?!?!?
4 It's just a small place, but it's my first time here after the remodel.   Late night Steak and Eggs for $10.99 seems pretty good. The steak cooked perfect and the service was great.  Stop by.
