3 It's Fry's.  There's nothing particularly special about this location.  It was more or less on the way home, so we stopped in for a few items we needed.  They are a decent grocery store with reasonable prices (usually), and good sales (sometimes).  Produce is fine, meat is fine.
4 So the produce area is a bit crowded to say the least. No twist ties which aggravated me. Thank God I had twist ties saved in my purse from last grocery shopping from a different location. Look by the bananas, that was the only place I could find twist ties.   Visited the deli to get sliced roast beef and Leigh was very courteous.   The layout of this store makes more sense to me versus the layout at the location at Gilbert Rd. And Baseline. Paper towels are down the baby aisle. Mmmk.   Upon check out Melissa the cashier and Megan the bagger were both extremely really nice and no awkward conversation. Megan was extremely efficient at bagging groceries. (If you go to Gilbert and Baseline Rd. location you will notice how sssslllloooww the baggers are, with very little personality too). They made checkout enjoyable.   I managed to put some extra twist ties into my purse for next trip. Didn't know they were a hot commodity.
