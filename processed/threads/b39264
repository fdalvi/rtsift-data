5 This is a terrific place. My son and I went and were both amazed by the results. Excellent experience. Excellent results. Excellent value. The gentleman who took care of us, LD, was extremely professional and caring. The process took about 45 minutes, was painless and resulted in a 12 shade improvement. All for less than $50. Amazing. If you're thinking of whitening, I would definitely recommend that you call them. I never knew it could be so effective, easy and affordable.
5 I had such a wonderful experience here. I would definitely recommend the whitening depot! My results was better than I had expected. I can't wait to go to have it done again!!!
