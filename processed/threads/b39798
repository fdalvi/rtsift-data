1 My wife brought my daughter here for a scheduled  appointment and was 5 minutes late. They said there were now 5 people ahead of her so she could wait or reschedule for the next available apt.5 hours later.
4 I have been to this location a couple of times.  The staff does a great job with my daughter and she loves being about to watch a movie or play a game while she gets her hair cut.  I love that there are locations all around the valley.  I usually go to the Gilbert location but we happend to be out in this area one day and I saw the shop.  It was the perfect opportunity to stop for a haircut.  My daughter's birthday was coming and she was also going on a mini vacation to her aunt's house plus back to school after her fall break so she was in need of some sprucing up.  :) We were in and out in 20 mins!  Thanks Cool Cuts 4 Kids!!
2 My daughter got a good haircut but the staff wasn't very friendly. We walked into an empty store and stood there for almost a minute before the two girls behind the counter would even acknowledge our presence while they chatted away. Then the first words out of their mouth were "can I get a phone number?" Not very inviting for a place who's marketing message is fun and cool.
