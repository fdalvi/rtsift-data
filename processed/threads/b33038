4 I have been with Nevada state bank for almost 10 years. It's an excellent bank to bank with. In this amount of time I'm sure you understand that I've had a couple skirmishes with them here and there. Nothing big where I needed to open up a new account somewhere else. I like that there are a lot of these banks in town so it can be quite convenient. I don't like that it's stationed in nevada only and that I cannot withdraw cash in other states without getting fined for it. Other than that, customer service has never been that bad. Could be better at times, but once again I have nothing to really complain about.
1 They suck and do not know what they are doing.  I go in one day with a notarized bank authorization and they give me the statements I need and then I go in the next day and they say they cannot release the statements under the same notification.  Its like one day they have one set of rules and the other day they have a different set.  I asked to speak to the manager and of course she was not available even though she was sitting her office.
