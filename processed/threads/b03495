5 I have had my yard maintained by Bim's team for almost 2 years and they do an amazing job. I also use Josh and his team to take care of our pool including the installation of our heat pump so we can use the pool year around.  Is great to have a single point of contact for anything related to the yard or pool.  I highly recommend Bim's for lawn maintenance and pool service.
5 Very responsive and reliable. Thank you to Bim & his crew!
5 Bim's has been taking care of our yard for almost 10 years - prices are reasonable, they always show up as scheduled, and they keep the place looking great.
