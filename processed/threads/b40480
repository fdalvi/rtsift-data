5 I went to this new dance fitness studio near where I work, I haven't ever done dance fitness so was nervous about trying something new, but I had such a great time.   They let me try classes for free which is awesome so I don't have to commit to paying for a membership or paying for classes when I wasn't sure if I would like it or not.   The owner was teaching the first class I took. She was super approachable, friendly, and has great energy. I definitely recommend it and will be back!
5 The folks who run Alter Ego Fitness are super friendly, professional, and the space is gorgeous! You feel like you're in your own private dance club at Alter Ego Fitness, with a fun, non-judgmental vibe. Among other classes, Crystal teaches Zumba, and it's the best class I've ever taken! The first week's free, go, you'll love it!
5 The place and instructors are fantastic!! Not only experienced, but beyond friendly with everyone who walks through the door; encouraging and teach a great and incredibly fun workout.  I've tried zumba and dance classes all  over the valley - honestly, nothing compares.  Whether your a beginner, or experienced dancer as myself, this place is a great fit.  Love it and would recommend to anyone
5 I've been going here since it opened and it's fantastic! Zumba with Crystal is like no where else! They are great about feedback and schedules and classes they offer. Try it! You won't regret it!
