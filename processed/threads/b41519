3 I've been in twice and both times took way way too long. The last time it took 18 minutes to get one bottle of oil and I was the only one there. It was the same reason as the time before; the guy couldn't log into his computer system. I do enjoy the product but it keeps getting harder to go back to this store.
5 Great service. Got some killer new liquids. Plus the fact they can make any pg/vg level you want is a plus!!!!
5 Love this place, they have everything that all the other shops have combined in one and they make their juice while your standing there.  They have specials that are sent to your text and email and I get a free 30ml bottle of juice for my birthday.  Your Awesome Gourmet!! Thank you
5 So I have been buying my vapor juices here for a few months now. They must have like 100 house juices- not to mention you can make your own- plus any PG/VG ratio too! Their liquids are the least expensive in town. Seems like they have sales & special offers going on every time I'm there. All of their employees are super nice and helpful. Only downside is sometimes it can take a few mins to make custom juices-only because they do it right then and there. Also basically only place in town to get cartomizers. I really like this shop and you should definitely check it out if you vape or are curious about it! Good location too right off the 60 next to Trader Joe's which is always a plus. Great deals on tanks, kits and mods too.
