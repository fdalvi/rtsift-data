1 I never gave one star on my yelp reviews. But this dental office doesn't deserve more than that. I had a horrible experience of getting root canal done here. I guessed the dentist didn't numb me enough before the surgery. I felt pain when he started digging my tooth. I told him few time about the pain. All he did was saying "it's okay and you can do it". He finally stopped and numbed me more when I started crying and telling him I felt "sharp pain". Why wouldn't he numb me more at first time I told him about the pain!!!!? I choose this dental office because I was new in Vegas. And it's close to where I live. There are so many nice dentists out there and charge same price like this place does. Don't come here unless you like to be tortured!!!!!!!
5 I've been coming to this dental office for over 7 years.   The staff is really nice and helpful. I'm not sure if its just my mouth, but I never have any problems with pain. They really accommodate to me since I cannot breathe through my nose, so they'll intermittently stop to make sure I'm ok.   They offer flex plans for those that cannot pay the charges that your insurance won't cover.   Rosa in the front office is great!
5 Our entire family has been going to dr. pham for 5 years, he is so great, and his people are too. They work with you on payments when you are having a hard time, and the doc never forgets things you tell him once you get to know him, he acts like a neighbor. Dr. Pham rocks!!
