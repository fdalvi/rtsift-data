1 BE WARNED.... He will impress you in your initial interview. Once you pay him $8,000. his game changes... All that you expressed that mattered to you, those things he agreed to and all that he said IS OUT THE DOOR!                                               It's at that point you need a lawyer to protect you from this lawyer!                                                                    He knows how to take advantage of you and he will! He completely stands OUTSIDE the lines of integrity.                                                                                             He lied several times and attempted to cover on SOOO many occasions.  I was seeing RED FLAGS from every direction!!                                                          Unbelievable really... To watch someone take advantage of you and not be able to stop him. Its lawyers like this...that give ALL layers a bad name!                              Using Rowley was the biggest mistake of my life. I was billed for several  conversations that never took place. When I went into the office to ask about the bill he refused to answer my question.... Said in a threatening way, " if you want to ask questions about your bill  I'm going to charge you more!" If your looking for a lawyer to protect you through a difficult time.... Be WARNED, this one is out for ALL HE CAN GET that may leave you wishing you had a lawyer to protect you from your lawyer... ;)  It's surprising to me that any professional .....in any industry could get by taking advantage of his own clients by acting in such a non ethical way.  I have more than enough reasons to have him disbarred, yet b/c I choose to move forward in my life I've let it go. Yet my only regret is that he will continue taking advantage of young women and not acting in good faith. There you have it... If your considering using Rowley... I've warned you.
1 Stephanie S could not have said it better.  I had exactly the same experience.  I did need a lawyer after this lawyer, to do the original work!    I was taken advantage of, threatened,  unbelievably overbilled, criticized, and just plain belittled at every turn.  This guy is a menace to society.  Really sick.
1 Both Helen and Stephanie are dead right. Gave them several thousands to help in a custody battle and after a few months got a bill for another 5k!!! I called to ask what it was about since we havent even been in court and nothing had been done yet and they kept saying my lawyer was busy or out of the office. His secretary was on lunch or out of the office... EVERY time I called. I left voice mails for weeks and never once got a reply. I refused to pay unless they could explain why they were charging me another 5k right before the case.. NOTHING!!! Im from out of state so I had no other means to get ahold if my lawyer but call and I was ignored, COMPLEATLY ignored and they billed me for calling and leaving voice mails!!! now I have to find another lawyer fast with all our savings spent on this firm. DO NOT USE THEM, DO NOT CALL THEM, STAY AWAY!!! I will be filing a civil suit once the custody case is over
1 Stay far away from this attorney. He goes to court unprepared, stammers, stumbles, and forgets crucial evidence -- overall he tries to "wing it." Yes he will impress you in his initial visit, but DON'T LET IT FOOL YOU! His paralegal, Kimberly, is nice and seems to have her talent wasted on this attorney. She is overwhelmed and would make a far better attorney if her time wasn't spread so thin -- too thin to handle things in a timely manner. I'm not sure what Rowley does while billing away (and away and away), but he certainly did a very poor job on my case. I had to file a case against him with the State Bar. Unbelievably he did threaten and criticize me constantly. Stay away from him!
