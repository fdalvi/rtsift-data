5 This was my first Spray tanning experience and have to say it was great! I have been back 3 times!  As a man with a shaved head,I think  you just look healthier with a good tan. And didn't want to go to a tanning bed, it just seems unhealthy long term.  So I gave this a shot and I'm hooked.  The staff does a great job of following up and answering all my stupid questions! haha
5 I checked this place out when I was in Phoenix for a weekend, as I needed some color for an upcoming wedding. The studio is incredibly cute and the owner made it a point to ensure I was comfortable and satisfied with my results. She gave me a lot of info about the process and about maintaining my tan. My color looks great and I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town!
5 I LOVED my experience at Bronze Buddha Glow. I was a first timer but wanted to give spray tanning a try because it's so much better than the tanning beds. My main fear was being too orange. Luckily I had nothing to worry about. The color was great! A nice golden tan just like I'd hoped. Jayd was really relaxed and fun. She made me feel very comfortable and did a great job. No streaking whatsoever. For the service and quality, it's a great price. I'd highly recommend this place and will definitely be going back! Plus the studio space is really cute too!
5 I love Bronze Buddha Glow! I needed a last minute tan for a photo shoot coming up in a few days. Being a pale redhead- I needed somebody who I could communicate clearly with on the right shade- - one that would be great for photos and still look right with my features. She listened to what I wanted, and made sure that my color was great throughout.   Also, she knows what she is doing. I used to be a spray tan-o-holic and have done my fair share of airbrushes done by a person, and automatic machines such as Mystic and VersaSpa. She made sure that  absolutely none of the spray rubbed on every part of my body, and used a specific dryer RIGHT after tanning all those "trouble" spots that rub off super easy. She used the dryer on my whole body right after the spraying of course, too, and even went through at the very end and "detailed" my tan to make EXTRA sure there were no spots, etc. For first time tanners, she also made sure that before, during, and after my appointment to give advice on proper preparation and maintenance during and after the tan.   Also, going as chemical free and natural is very important to me, as most people that are conscious of toxic chemicals in solutions are. Not only is her spray free of toxic chemicals, it does not have that horrible tanning solution smell. Yes! Huge score!  This is definitely the place for me to go to when I need a spray tan and am in Phoenix.
5 Jayd is awesome! She was so accommodating the evening before Valentines day when I went in to get a spray tan. She is a true professional and her space, adorable! I also love that she uses organic products. I felt like Jayd wanted me to look my best and really took her time making sure everything is perfect before and after my service. Bronze Buddha Glow is an amazing place to feel at home and get your tan on!
5 I recently needed to attend a social event and noticed I could use a little color. Not a big fan of UV I decided to try the safer spray alternative. After seeing before and after pictures online, I decided to give Bronze Buddha Glow a try. I was really nervous about ending up looking unnaturally "orange" and even mentioned it to Jayd that was attending me. She assured me I had absolutely nothing to worry about. As it turns out, they were RIGHT! The result was exactly what I was looking for; an even, NATURAL tan! I will, without a doubt continue to go here in the future. The results and customer care are the best you'll find anywhere!
5 Wow! Very impressed. First time client a few days before my wedding. She listened to my concerns. Tan is perfect! Natural sun kissed glow without the chemical smell. To top it off she gave great instructions on pre and post tan to keep the color and called the next morning to see if I needed any touch ups!! Can't get better than that!
5 I got tanned by Jayd yesterday while she was here in LA for a visit. She showed up with all her mobile gear and was so professional and efficient!!   A few days prior to my appointment I received an email from Jayd on tips on how to prepare my skin before my tan. This was helpful because although I have been tanned before and knew many of these tips I was glad to have a refresher so I didn't miss anything! When Jayd showed up for the appointment she set up quickly and was ready to tan me in less than 10 minutes. She made me feel extremely comfortable which is a good thing when you're standing in your birthday suit in front of someone!! The tanning process was very smooth and I could tell that Jayd's technique (in comparison to previous tans I've received from others) was advanced.   The morning after my custom airbrush I woke up to with a beautiful glow! I looked as if I had just come back from an amazing, relaxing tropical vaca (haha I wish!). Despite having to work before getting to shower my tan off I was pleasantly surprised to see that my tan came out even without any splotchiness. I am so pleased with the result and I will definitely steal some of Jayd's time to tan me next time she's in LA!!!
5 Jayd is amazing at what she does! I highly recommend her! I went in and asked for a dark tan, which is what I left with. The Customer Service is great. She makes you feel very comfortable from the time you go in until the minute you leave. I'm a spray tanning newbie so she told me everything I needed to know about how to get it to last. She was thorough and my tan looked fabulous, tan, and even. I'm a bit overdue for a spray tan now. I will definitely be booking another appointment with her soon.  I highly recommend this place.
5 Wow. Jayd not only gave me what I needed for my wedding, she was able to accommodate us last minute and came to our house. She was completely professional, even when dealing with my crazy family! She also put my friends to ease since it was their first time. Also, she knows all of the hookups for beauty treatments in the valley, so trust her with those!!!!
5 I had the pleasure of meeting Jayd yesterday for an airbrush tan.  She totally makes you feel at ease being in your birthday suit.  She brought me from pasty white to having a sun kissed glow in less then 30 minutes!    Her customer service is top-notch as well.  I received an email from her letting me know a few simple steps to take prior to my tan and this morning she even text me to see how I liked my tan!  She will be my go-to person from now on for airbrush tanning!
5 Tonight was my first time going to Jayd and I'm so happy I listened to my fellow Yelpers and their reviews. When spring hits, I'm all over getting spray tans frequently. She is one of, if not the best beautician I've been to. She took her time to make sure everything was even, dry and natural looking. She was also very friendly and thorough as to how I should take care of my tan throughout the week. I will most definitely be using her as my "go to" gal from now on. Thanks again, Jayd!
5 I was very nervous about getting my first spray tan.  I thought that spray tans tend to look too orangey, but Jayd helped put me at ease.  Before the appointment, she sends an email with all of the tips that you need to make sure that the tan fades naturally.  During the tan, she was very attentive to making sure that the tan is even.  She also took a lot of time to make sure to dry out all the areas to prevent the tan from looking blotchy.   The tan lasted around a week and looked really natural.  I would definitely recommend Bronze Buddha to all of my friends.
5 This gem of a studio space is located in the Arcadia neighborhood of Phoenix, not far from La Grande Orange Grocery & the original Postino Winebar.   The Atrium business complex hosts a number of Therapists, Family Counselors, a roofing company, two  noted Interior Designers, an affordable Massage Studio and an architect or two.  Jayd's reception area is calm and has a designer's touch.  I office nearby and stopped in a few months ago to see how a custom Airbrush Tan experience would work with Jayd.  I've never had one and thought it good to know before sending my wife to Bronze Buddha Glow.    Jayd walked me through the process, start to finish and explained how important it is to prepare the skin beforehand.  A sugar or salt scrub, loofah or just exfoliating at home is needed to remove any flaky or dead skin prior to the tan.  It's also recommended not to shower for 8-10 hours afterwards.  She can also add a boost of sorts to make you even darker.  After the initial conversation, I passed along Jayd's card to my wife and they set up the appointment a few weeks later.  Kate was happy with the end result and will definitely return again.
5 This is the best place to go for a spray tan in Phoenix! Very cute studio, and I felt like Jayd was as dedicated to my tan as I was. I've been spray tanned before and I did not get the detailed instructions for before and aftercare. Jayd made sure I understood everything and made recommendations to me. My tan is not streaky or uneven, it's absolutely perfect 2 days later!
5 Awesome airbrush tan! Very natural and even. Jayd does an awesome job and goes above and beyond to make sure that you are happy with the results and know how to take care of your tan. I will definitely be back. :)
