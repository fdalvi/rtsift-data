4 The owner, John, is right in his comment.  He did contact me personally to work out the problems, even giving a full discount on part of my order, and a future discount for other orders.  He satisfied me completely, and I'm sure you can get quality products AND service at Faville Photo.
5 I have been enlarging some of my photos to hang up as art for the past 15 years or so and had been using standard photo printing. I discovered Giclee printing in mid-2011.  I learned that essentially it is more color pixels per square inch so the photos turn out richer and better defined (I am simplifying the explanation of the technology here!). I found two vendors online that offered Giclee printing. I decided to go with Faville Printing because their rates were more competitive and they had a great range of papers and other mediums such as Canvas.  Once I placed the order, I also found out that the service is excellent.  Very quick response time and fast shipping.  Also, great advice on which medium will go better with which photos.  The photos, with Faville's Giclee printing are just amazing.  A huge improvement over the printing I was getting done using standard printing, and well worth the extra price.  I will never use standard printing again for enlargements!
5 The product is 100% professionally created, completed, and delivered. John is always flexible and customer service oriented. I always look forward to seeing the results!
