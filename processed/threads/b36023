5 I enjoy going to Kat's Optical to buy eye glass frames. She has a unique sense of what is right for me to wear for my face. I am always happy with my purchases at her shop because she provides me with excellent customer service to make sure I am happy. She is a completely knowledgeable optician, because she gets the right lenses for me each time.
4 Small shop, unique frames and personal service from Kat herself.  She wants to genuinely help and see you in the best glasses for your face, lifestyle, etc.. Great, helpful local, small business!
5 I was shopping for Wiley-X MC prescription glasses, found Kats Eyes. Kat clearly knows the business, and did an excellent job of getting the correct lenses and frames. My wife purchased normal eyewear, and Kat fit them to her perfectly - something never before done. My view - Kat is a total master eyewear technician, and the quality shows. Very happy with both sets of eyewear, absolutely will buy there again.   Damaged my MC glasses 2 months later, Kat repaired without question or complaint, tweaked the frames to perfection. Outstanding care for customer satisfaction, worth checking out.  Prices not much higher than factory stores, if at all.
