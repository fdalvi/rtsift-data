4 Good massage, great body wrap!  $100 special is a good value.  My girlfriend and I and both had massages and body wraps.  The place was a little short staffed so we didn't go together.  While she was getting a massage, I was getting a wrap and vice a versa.  Not really a big deal, but it would have been better if we had been together.    The massage was good.  I was relaxed and content after.  The body wrap was amazing.  It's hot and you sweat a ton.  The idea is that the fat mets and you eliminate it over the next couple days leaving you with less inches and firmer skin.  What do you know ... it worked!
5 I love this place:) welcoming and friendly staffs are really helpful. The massage was really relaxing!
5 I would go back to "Let's Wrap" for sure!!  Limmie was a great masseuse and next time I go back I will ask for him.  The infared wrap was my first one and oh man did I sweat!!  Loved my experience and would defiantly recommend.  Thanks, Chad
5 My mom got my wife and I a wrap for her birthday. So we finally decided to make an appointment and try it out.  1st place is clean, 2nd personnel very nice , helpful, 3rd we loved the wrap.  We had a great time, we talked watched tv, enjoyed our time away from kids and work.   We will be back!
5 This place is a gem! I have visited lets Wrap many times and i must say that i love it here. Its very quiet and relaxing. They offer many services and they are local friendly. You wont find any over the top strip prices here and they take the time to actually make sure you enjoy your time there. I would reccomend lets wrap being that i feel it is one of the best in LV.  1: Establishment is very clean.  2: I got the valentines day special. (infared body wrap and massage).  3: Staff was very friendly.  4: All services were true to time. (very important)   5: There was no upselling. !  Will def return!
