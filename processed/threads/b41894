5 I have been waiting months for this place to open.  Family owned and operated.  Went in after work. . Ermahgerd. . This Zza is incredible! Well worth the wait. I will be going many times over, for sure.  You gotta try it. .  They have salads and stuff too. Everything is fresh and made in house.    Update7/23/14: I have made it a regular occurrence. My SO and I can't get enough of their food.  Not every trip includes the pizza (gotta watch my figure lol)  but at the least,  we are walking out with a salad.  Anna and Reza are the nicest people and very welcoming. Glad to have them in the neighbourhood.  Hands down the best pizza place in all of KW.
5 FINALLY a good pizza place in K/W Cambridge!!   EASILY the best pizza in the region.  Fresh and unique toppings, delicious sauces, and their salads are amazing. Joseph H's review must have been a bad day, because every time I've been there it's always busy.  I've only ever had their fresh made pizzas, never one of their pre-made slices, tho. Apparently this place is all the rage, as I know people that live in that area and they all rave about it! I can't stress enough...try this place.  Their pizza is THE BEST!!!
