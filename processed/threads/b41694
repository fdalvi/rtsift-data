5 5 star rating.   I called Liberty Home Repair to fix my sliding patio door that was stuck  Dror showed up to give a quote and instead went ahead and fixed it right on the spot.  He was polite and efficient.   I recommend him to others who need home repair services   The pricing was reasonable as well.
5 Prompt, clean, polite! Dror did a very professional job of drywall and texture for me. He seems to know how to do any home project. He is my first choice for handyman work now!
