5 With Mother's Day coming up I wanted to do something special for the important women in my life. The owner/floral designer of Rhonda Rose Floral "rose" to the occasion and, in fact, far exceeded my expectations! I ordered two floral arrangements - both were tasteful, elegant, and just simply stated....... Beautiful! I wanted certain flowers incorporated into the arrangement and the owner did the rest and came up with the design. If you're looking for the "WOW!" factor in your floral arrangement purchases, I would highly recommend this florist - you won't be disappointed!
5 I live in abq and my mom lives in Vegas.  I called Rhonda to place an order for mother day because it's near where my mom's house.  Their service is extraordinary and very friendly. I Highly recommended.
5 After reviewing multiple websites and trying to find the perfect flowers to be delivered next day and failing over and over again, I called Rhonda Rose Floral. Not only did she have the most beautiful white Calla Lillie's for me, she arranged them perfectly and had them delivered here in Las Vegas the very same day. I couldn't have found a better florist! I will never use the big websites again as long as I know Rhonda is still in town! Thanks again for making my girlfriend the happiest girl in Las Vegas!
5 Rhonda Rose Floral really gets the feel for each of her clients. She personalize each arrangement so the person receiving the bouquet knows the sender heart went into it. It is more of an experience than just picking out a bouquet from a picture online. You can not go wrong with this service. It is a 5 star rating for sure.
