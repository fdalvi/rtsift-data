5 I've been working with Suburban Mortgage (Dusti) since before we started looking at homes to buy. Dusti has been the easiest and nicest person to work with during our whole process. I've never been apart of buying a home prior to this house, but Dusti has made the whole thing stressfree! I think her help is going to make me love our new home even more! I couldn't ask for a better company to work with!
1 If you want to deal with uneducated and unprofessional loan officers, wait three months for your loan to close, miss your closing date, loose the house of your dreams and pay $2000 in originations charges, stop looking,this is definitely your mortgage broker!
5 This is my 4th experience working a mortgage company.  I have used both big and small companies alike. The Suburban Mortgage team is excellent.  The best experience I have had!  My wife and financed our most recent home with Jim Batstone and the Suburban Mortgage team.  We closed early, the rates were competitive, and the loan went off without a hitch.  Jim approached our deal with honesty and was able to find us a very deal.  These guys are excellent.  Spend your money locally and give them a shot.
5 Jennifer Spiller was amazing. She made our home buying experience as painless as possible.  I would highly recommend her to anyone buying a home.  It was definitely a five star experience.
