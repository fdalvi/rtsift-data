5 I've been coming here since they first opened and I won't go anywhere else! Great chairs, friendly staff and excellent work!!
2 Went with my wife, great new chairs, however another quantity over quality place with an unpleasant owner, my wife would go somewhere else next time.
4 Very beautiful salon, decent prices - nothing out of the ordinary. I think the guy I had for my pedi is new/inexperienced. Still nice though. Will probably come back, but request someone else.
1 They were not very friendly or inviting. My nails were not done well & they did not seem to care about the quality of work.
