4 Awesome..... They really went out of their to be as helpful as possible to get me the furniture I wanted delivered when I wanted and how I wanted plus they had a pretty decent selection of furniture for immediate delivery ........ special thanks to Guy for stepping up and going above and beyond the call of duty..... Til next time
4 A nice mix of different types of furniture, from sectionals, office tables, chaises, and dining tables, just to name a few. The staff was friendly and had a no-pressure attitude when we went. Prices are competitive, and while we aren't quite ready to buy yet, this would be a good option once we are!
5 I went in a few months ago looking for a sofa, and ended up finding much more for well under my budget. The 90 day interest-free financing option I received allowed me to pay off my furniture quickly and easily online. I worked with Sunshine and we had spoken several times over the phone, before and after my purchase, and she was always friendly and courteous. My delivery arrived on time and the movers were kind enough to even help assemble the new tv I purchased along with my living room furniture. I recommend stopping in if you are in the market for new furniture.
4 great prices good customer service
4 Pretty big selection. I was able to haggle the price of my dining table from 270 to 230. I will do business with them again.
