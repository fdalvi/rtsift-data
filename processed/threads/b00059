4 It was a rare for me that during my college years of blossoming into manhood that I didn't start my night by a trip to Walgreen's. It was also rare that I didn't traumatize the clerk with my purchases.  During the period of time when Keith Charles was known as " Whiskeysaurus Rex" or "Bad Fritz"  and it was common that the following items were being purchased prior to a big night out on the town.  1. Glow Sticks 2. Condoms 3. Met Rx Protein Bar with 32 grams of whey protein isolate 4. Altoids- Cinamon 5. Marb lights 6. Monster Energy Drink (low carb to keep my girlish figure) 7. Motivational stickers  8. Spare lighter 9. Cherry flavored chap stick 10. Plastic hip flask 11. Corn cob pipe (merely for style) 12. 1 liter of Bubble Gum flavored Pedialyte   With all of these item stowed safely in my man bag, or "murse" I was ready for any adventure that the night may hold.  Now I know that major corporations are horrible for small business and are generally bad, but where else can a list like this be purchased with one stop ?  Hauki !  Light blue trojans please Spermicidal for the win ! Do I need road flares ?  Talent ? When you are carrying the above listed items all in one basket, women tend to avoid making eye contact with you, thus making talent hard to judge
5 Gotta give a big THANKS! to this Walgreens.  I found myself there shoeless with an overheated dog and they had no problem letting me come in with the dog to buy some water for him.  It is rare for a big chain store to be so dog and barefoot friendly!
4 It's the typical Wallgreen's.  What I like is it is very close to our home and therefore very convenience when having a prescription filled.     We also use this place to get our candy prior to going to a movie and at times there are some nice sales going on which make it even cheeper.     At times they also have some nice selections when it comes to seasonal items such as Easter, Halloween and Christmas.
