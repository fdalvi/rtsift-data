5 Cars are cars; I can find the same make and model anywhere if I look hard enough, but I am truly glad that I went with 888 Motors. The sales manager was incredibly friendly and customer service was his first priority.   Buying a car is always a headache and a hassle, going from sale person to sales person each of them giving you the run around. 888 made me feel like a VIP customer and treated me like a human being and not just a sale. I left their with a great price and an even better car.   Will definitely come back and recommend to friends and family!
5 I was in the market for a Porsche Panamera and Mercedes SL500 for about a month until I came across 888 Motors.  The owner had the perfect Black on Black, fixed up SL500 .. Exactly what I was looking for!  He was so easy to work with, gave me a great price and even had great financing available!  I felt like I was finally getting a good deal and getting taken care of where as other dealerships all they cared about was making a sale!  I told the owner I also needed a Porsche Panamera for my wife and gave him exact details of the year, color, and my price range.  I gave him a deposit on that so he could start looking for the car I needed and so he would know I was 100% serious.  Lucky for me, the owner is Trustworthy and a Family Man, not just any Salesman you deal with in most these dealerships here in this city!  Within 1 week he had found me the exact Porsche I wanted! I bought 2 of my dream cars from him and have already referred him to a good friend that also bought a car from him.  More importantly, My wife has been in the greatest Mood all year! :)
5 Joe & Kate were a tremendous help to me for finding my car.  I had a lot of questions but they answered all of them.  Excellent customer service and knowledge of all vehicles that I had questions about.  I have and will continue to refer friends to utilize Joe's services.
