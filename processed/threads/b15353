5 Went in search of a graduation present for myself (courtesy of a family member). Started at the department stores in the mall to no avail. Decided to check out Tumi. The sales person Joy was awesome. She showed me several leather and non leather backpacks. I took her card and kept shopping the rest of the day.  The next day I came back. She remembered me and was still so very helpful when I brought reinforcements (my wife) to make sure I was making the right choice, considering the expense. We bought a very nice backpack (professional) and had it monogrammed while we waited.  The overall experience made me wish I could afford more items from the store. I'll be back and thanks Joy for the wonderful service!!
