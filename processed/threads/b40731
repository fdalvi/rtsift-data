5 Great Service and very knowledgeable.  Was really happy that I found this Shop that fixes and rebuilds Alternator's.   I dealt with one of the owners, Mario...  Very honest and reliable...  Quoted me a price and even thou it ended up being a bigger job then we all thought...  He stood by his price....   I had already checked with several shops before calling Alternator Dept.   Alternator Depot had the best price and offered a 2 year warranty on my rebuilt alternator.  Don't forget to tell them you saw  the review on Yelp...  I am so happy that I found Alternator Depot...
5 After getting price quotes in the $850 range to replace an alternator with a noisy bearing. (Toyota Rav4) we started looking at alternatives.  Quotes from dealer and independent repair shops were similar. I was going to try and replace the bearing myself. A rebuilt unit from a car parts place was $177.  We called Alternator Depot to purchase the bearing for a self repair. They said just bring it down and they would remove the alternator, rebuild it, and reinstall it.  Also they said pick up a new serpentine belt and they would replace it in the process.  All for $23 more than a rebuilt unit cost at a parts store.  They did great work and were done when they said they would be. Very honest shop. Almost didn't go because they didn't have any feedback.
4 Started having alternator problems and went to an AAA approved repair facility where I was quoted $400- to replace and install a new one. I later contacted Alternator Depot and was quoted $165- for them to rebuild my original. A couple of weeks later I had a small problem with the rebuilt one but the guys at Alternator Depot corrected the problem and haven't had any problems since. Was very happy with the price and service!
