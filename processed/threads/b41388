5 Best gelato ever!! I've tried many gelato places and nothing compared to this!! You can taste the authenticity!!
3 I stayed at the Venetian last year when I visited Las Vegas and we stopped in here for breakfast, a quick breakfast at that...fruit, croissants, and coffee.  It was full during breakfast time so we got our food to go.  I stayed at the Mirage this year and wandered back over to this place as we were looking for a nice sit down place.  We opted to sit "outside" and enjoy the ambiance here.  The day before we got a menu to check out and decided to go back.  A sit down breakfast isn't cheap in Las Vegas but this place was reasonable.  I had a bacon egg, and cheese croissant sandwich with a side of potatoes and coffee - it was about $15 or so.    If you're staying in the hotels in the area, don't overlook this place, it's located by the canal shops.
2 After enduring a grueling time share presentation for 4 hours, our bribery package included a free dinner to this place. I had the penne and DH had the lasagna. We both chose to go with the soup for the first course, which was a veggie barley. This soup had absolutely no flavor. If there was a picture in the dictionary, this soup would go next to the word BLAND. Also, when we asked for regular water, our waitress said still water... not sure what that meant but we said regular water. She brought out water in a glass bottle. After drinking some, I looked around and saw others getting their water by the pitcher. When I brought this to her attention, she said no problem and took the special water off our bill. My reason for 2 stars is that if you order wine, they only fill it less than halfway and there is better food to be found in Vegas!
