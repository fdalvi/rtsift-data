4 This place is very good.  I've been here many many times and can attest to it being consistent too.  There's a variety of Italian dishes, salads, appetizers, and personal size pizzas.  It whoops up on anything in a 5 mile radius for Italian.    I'm a personal fan of their rigatoni smoked chicken entree. Other contenders are the Tortellini Principesa, the gnocchi with blush sauce, and the 4 cheese pizza.  They often offer a fresh seafood entree special, which will always be fantastic.    The owner Vince is ultra nice and is usually chef'n it up in the back, so quality control is top notch.  They also have Bira Morreti on tap.
