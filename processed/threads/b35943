1 Stay away - you can thank me later. Most likely the worst food and service I've had in a long time.  Poor Customer Service: -Who would think we need silverware to eat our food? We had to ask for this after we got our food -No syrup for the waffles -We had no refills on our drinks -The waitress went missing for large amounts of time and I had to checkout at the front desk -She had ZERO personality.  -The manager never took care of our issues. We got disconnected in our conversation and never called me back or answered the phone when I contacted him back. I see where the poor customer service trickles down. -How dare I ask to use my points off my Fortune players card. They gave some excuse that there system can't handle the transaction (this is how they don't allow you to use the points from the casino).  Poor Food: -Steak is the worst steak I have ever had. Looked like someone stepped on it and cooked it on the grill. It was full of fat. I did not eat it and would not even feed it to my dogs. Steak was not cooked at the level I stated to the waitress.  -Waffles tasted horrible and they appeared to use pancake mix for the waffles, from the taste.    We felt ill and sick the rest of the day. Eat and dine at your own risk. If your a non-smoker this a heavy smoke filled place at night time.
