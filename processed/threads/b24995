5 Great place. Very friendly and knowledgeable.  Easy to schedule appointments 6 days a week. You don't have to worry about different people working on you, as it is owner operated.
3 It's too early to tell how effective this will be.  So far only two appointments, and the problem is not yet resolved (of course).  I will update this after we've had more sessions.  But the therapist (there is only one) seems to be very thorough and caring.
4 Well, after 3 weeks there is some improvement noted.  It's not "cured", but no one expected it that quickly.  However, the pain is not as frequent and the "good" periods are longer and more frequent.  Hopefully the podiatrist will recommend continuing the treatment.  They have a variety of equipment and techniques to handle the various problems we've seen while ours is being treated.
5 I've had a few issues over the years and Desert Sun PT has always come through. Brian and Holly run the place and are spot on with analysis/treatment. Super nice people as a side note as well. I am very glad I discovered Desert Sun PT!
5 Brian and Holly are amazing!! My friend recommended Dessert Sun as she had a fantastic experience as well. Great people with values... Very knowledgable and helpful in providing recommendations for a comfortable and quick recovery. I continue to recommend them and have since moved to California. I recently had an injury and happened to be in AZ. I couldn't wait to get in to them!! They worked around my schedule and are always so helpful. I wish I could bring them back to CA :)
