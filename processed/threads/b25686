4 The food is always fresh and consistent from this location.  The service is always great too.  They have not screw up a take out order on us yet.
5 As far as fast food goes it doesn't get much better than this store. Service is great, food is always fresh and hot!  Dining area and restrooms are always clean. Drive thru is 24hrs, so at two or three in the morning after having a few, there are always plenty of  hot and fresh tacos and chicken sandwiches to be had.
3 So much for fast food. This place is usually fast in getting the food out, but lately the service has slowed. Not sure what is going on. Quality is right where it should be for a Jack in the Box except for the times when they screw up an order which does not happen too often.
4 fast +cheap if you order the right thing + open late + makes goofy commercials  = Jack in the Box
