1 This school is not looking in the best interest of the student.  I have had problems with this school twice, had to go as far as notifying the board of education for the mistreatment and unfair claims presented by the staff and teachers.  I won my claim.  I ended up going on maternity leave when I had to start my externship with the school. I notified the school two weeks in advance on when I was returning and waiting for them to find me a place to do my externship. I was on hold for months and still did not finish my externship so I can graduate.  I am in process of taking them to court, but just want to warn all those who are looking to go to this school. Watch out they don't treat you with any respect and ARE NOT looking out for you, especially if they cant get externship sites for its students! The director Cheryl is the worst of them all.
1 Don't let the sweet talk get to you this is not the school they make it seem. They certainly do not respect or care about their students it is just a waste of money and your time! All they care is about the money they can care less if you pass or fail its a corrupted school and I would NOT recommend it to any body. Unfortunately I had to learn the hard way
1 Talk about a downward spiral...as in going down the toilet ! Tempe Campus is Terrible! Yesterday this stupid campus director Cheryl ? Just let go? Fired the only quality instructor they have! Cheryl Iverson, she was the cornerstone of this college. Now this person Tammy.. Who failed at teaching a single PCT class is leading the students into a waste of time and money!     Stay far far away from this Allied Health college. The acting president Roy H. does not care about you the Student, only the money $$$. If you really think your going have a job after spending thousands of dollars, do you research first!    Any investors reading this? This company, is doing a horrific job!  Go to Tempe campus and speak with the students!  I have heard of a class action taking place soon?
