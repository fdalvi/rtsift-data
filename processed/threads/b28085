5 In an area of town dominated by low quality tourist trap eateries, The Little Inn, and it's sister branch up near the castle, provide a rare sanctuary of decent, affordable food aimed more at local punters than 60 year old Norwegians with sandals and white socks.  Owned by a chap called Fred, who's become a bit of a legend among local office workers, it's just really your usual lunchtime and breakfast selection on offer. It's all very tasty, but it's more the homely atmosphere, New York Dolls on the stereo, and comical but fun sense of organised chaos when it gets busy, that combine to ensure I keep coming back.  Fred's cappucino is excellent, and he sprinkles loads of chocloate on top. It's a must.
4 Cheap and cheerful is what this place is all about. Situated at the top of the Royal Mile, The Little Inn is a great place to pop in for a drink and snack after browsing the streets and is always a popular spot with the tourists.  The Little Inn is very small inside so when it gets busy, which it frequently does, it can fell pretty cramped and crowded. There is always a lively and friendly atmosphere as the staff are incredibly warm and inviting. There serve sandwiches, baked potatoes, baguettes and they have a counter with home made baking which always looks completely divine! I love to come here for bacon sandwiches as you get excellent value for money, with 6 rashers of bacon in you roll and lashings of tomato sauce only costing Â£1.60 - what a bargain!   There serve a selection of drinks too including milkshakes (yum), teas and coffees which taste amazing. A really cute wee cafe which is great value for money, and best of all, serves the most delicious tasty food.
