1 Avoid. These guys have yet to get my order right after 3 visits. Nothing exciting either. Hamburger with catsup. Every time there's something wrong. I'll get a burger with everything, burger with mustard, chicken sandwich...  Definition of Durp. Their receipts print the taunting statement of "Concerns please call" and no number.
4 Bought me a large strawberry lemonade...I should've gotten a medium.  It was really good though.  Ordered large fries.  I thought I'd eat some and save some for later.  Nope, I ate the whole thing at one sitting; the fries were too healthy and not that great.  I asked the cashier for a handful of ketchup.  She told me I couldn't.  Turned out to be a mean joke lol.  And Vegas food prices are ridiculously expensive.
3 Oh geesh!  Where to begin. The girl was on her cell phone and all I could think of was "Gurrrrl F*** this job". I ordered a jr bacon cheeseburger to hold me over for dinner and it took 20 min. Insane!!!!  I should've got a frosty cone and called it a day. Not to mention the woman to the side of me kept coughing without covering her mouth. ALL reasons I dislike large crowds, especially at the mall. Bunch of mongaloids work here. I shouldn't be so mean, but Christ on a cracker. At least the woman on her cell phone apologized about the long wait. Now that's GREAT customer service.  Less talky and more communication would be even better.
4 I've been visiting this Wendy's for many years.  I go around eating at many places in the mall. This is one of my favorite places! I visit them frequently.   Most of the staff already knows my order. I am treated very well with every visit.  The quality of food is very equal to any other Wendy's location.   I've never had bad service at this location. All the employees are friendly, & efficient.   There are some negative aspects to visiting this location. The prices are higher than any location I've ever visited. Another bad thing is 99% of the time they don't have trays, so you get your food in a bag, even if you're dining in.  It's a great place to get a meal, at a reasonable price, if you're staying in the area.
