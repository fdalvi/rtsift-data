5 The best chocolates and french pastries!  There is a kiosk/cart in Mandalay Place that sells Vincent Pilon's chocolates and pastries to the public.  Chef Vincent has been on Food Network and has won numerous national awards.  It's all hand made and is actually by him.   It is made fresh.   You have to check it out.
3 Meandering my way through all the shops, I spotted this little chocolate kiosk. Chocolate always calls to me, so I stopped to stare.  The women manning the booth was friendly and chatty. She mentioned that Vincent pilon is food network a lot. I had never heard of him, but I thought I better buy some goodies anyway.   Well, the woman helping me forgot to put the box of chocolate truffles into my purchase. I was SOOOO sad when I realized later. So, I can't vouch for his candy, but I did try a cupcake, a brownie, and a chocolate candy thingy.     Cupcake was awesome. Best peanut butter frosting I think I have had. Wow. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FSeu1caOVyk3Ua_aWuVsHA?select=FlTAviwV5jhR8MkiSb-GNA  White cupcake with coconut. Had to try 'cuz I love coconut. Nope. Dry and no coconut flavor anywhere. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FSeu1caOVyk3Ua_aWuVsHA?select=F0MKTsUqiGCijRJ5vElyJg  Brownie cookie.  Yum. Good and rich. A friend said it is too rich and choclately. What does that even mean?  How can anything be TOO rich and chocolately. So obviously, this was GOOD. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FSeu1caOVyk3Ua_aWuVsHA?select=qZ6SQSgu97ZUH2ywQ8LtxA  Chocolate Crisp candy bal. Good. Nothing out of the ordinary. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FSeu1caOVyk3Ua_aWuVsHA?select=IaFTMmAaarW1V96ZXhnyFA  A solid 3.5 stars for good Peanut butter frosting and brownie cookie.
