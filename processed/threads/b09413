5 I gotta tell ya this is my Favorite radio station!!  I Love me some smooth Jazz!  Not to mention they have Fabulous contests and giveaways all the time!  I've won tickets to Micheal Buble' and 6 movie passes to the Sedona film festival, Hoping to win their trip a day give away or the $1000$ workday too!
1 KYOT how did you quietly invade all of the offices and restaurants of my life?  I've had all of the George Benson, Chuck Mangione, Spyro Gyra, and Kenny G. one man can take for a lifetime.  You've done it, you've smoothed me to near death with what you falsely call "jazz" (I have another word for it using three of those four letters).  I know others have been led astray by your wallpapery aural seduction, but you can't fool me, you just can't.
1 So Phoenix doesnt have enough Jazz listeners?....been listening to KYOT since the first day...had enough! Im so disappointed in the change of format...there are enough oldie stations out there....and though the repetitious easy listening jazz was all we heard...it was better than listening to Michael Jackson....damn....good luck Eva...just changed all my pre-sets...It would be a miracle to hear a True Jazz station in Arizona playing McCoy Tyner, Dave Brubeck, John Coltrane, Maynard Ferguson, Chic Corea, Herbie Hancock, Thelonius Monk, Charles Mingus, Michael Patrucciani, and the rest of the best of Jazz. Guess Im breaking out my CDs and turning off the radio.
1 Nice job messing with something that people liked. The new format is horrible. No longer have it programmed as a station to listen to in my car. Sad really, I had listened to this station for years.
5 PLEASE  Bring back the smooth jazz of yesteryear!  Seriously, not enough listeners?   Had enough pop music and AC/DC for awhile, need some alternative toons plz!!!!   I only put the 5 stars in because I want a change.   If I put in a vote for.......EVA, there would be no stars!   Love all the artists, but need some JAZZ artists, there are so many.
