5 Great service - thanks!
4 been here a few times since its been FedEx office, once to use the "office" to print something because i was out of ink at home,another to ship a $130 headset (which was THROWN into my gated yard and nearly damaged upon receiving via FedEx that i'm not counting in this review) and another to fax an important document. when i went here to print via the computers available for public use via a reloadable store card the employee who loaded the card and got me started made me feel like i was stupid for not knowing how to insert the card and get their old windows 2000 fired up for use and printing! the overall staff and service quality is OK, never really crowded but the staff is rather slow on a good day, the prices are rather pricy but not too bad, this location is just a few miles from my house so it's pretty convenient if i need to ship something. if you need something shipped or faxed ( i would say printed to but i went here instead of the mesquite library near PV Mall because i was heading to blockbuster down the street, however the library doesn't charge to use their pc's and printing is cheap there) I would definitely recommend this location to a friend (as a matter of fact i actually have when somebody i knew needed to ship something in a hurry and wasn't sure where to go)
3 The staff at this location is very friendly. They always greet customers as they walk in. Everyone seems happy to assist with copying or shipping needs, and it's a nice sized store that never has a long wait to use anything. They also offer free wifi to customers. I just found out today that they take credit and debit cards and you don't have to prepay their card. How convenient! I like having that choice.
