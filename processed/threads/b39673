1 I love Korean food and have ate at a lot of Korean restaurants.. This is by far the worst Korean restaurant in Las Vegas. The food is horrible, the service is just as bad. Server didn't know the difference between one soup from another. They charged a soup dish $10 bucks that would be free at any other Korean restaurant. No wonder the place was empty like a ghost town. Will never eat here again..
4 First of all, our reviews and ratings all depend on how well this place meets or exceeds our expectations for that given moment and situation. If my situation was to entertain a customer or a "out of town" guest with the best authentic korean food, my rating would be perhaps a two, only because of the "five star" places i have experienced in LA and Seoul. But understand that those are different situations. I was once traveling to Indiana with a Korean customer, and after days of great American food, he couldn't take it any longer and begged me for any kind of Korean "Tang" or soup. This was before days of cellular phones, so i looked in the white pages and found a Korean last name. I called them and explained my emergency, and was able to get a name of a place where we could remotely order anything that was even close to what my customer needed, (Korean Soup!) Once there, the place wasn't even a Korean restaurant, and the lady was happy to see a couple of Koreans. She agreed to go off the menu (it was like a regular diner) and made us two Yook-Gae-Jang (). To describe this, it was not even close to our wildest expectations, as it was a modified american vegetable soup with tabasco and other hot spices. It fell short of our minimum expectations, as the dish itself was not in the definition of the name. But even so, we were thankful for the over priced vegetable soup with extra spices. 20 or so years ago, Vegas was kind of like that experience in Indiana. You would be thankful to be able to eat Korean food, let alone Korean food that met expectations. Now, we have a substantial population of Koreans and even seem to have a Korean Supermarket. So, back to my story. I came from LA area to attend a trade show for my wife. We brought our two teenage, American born girls to stay during the business trip. We ate the Buffets, the waffles, tacos, etc. but now needed some "Soul recharging" Korean Basics 101. I ordered some Bibimbap, Omrice (for the kids), Ttuk mandoo kuk, Sun tofu soup, and took it back to our hotel room. In one word, everyone was satisfied to a five star level. Was it the best Korean food ever?  For our situation and circumstance, it exceeded our needs. If i just arrived in Las Vegas from LA, we might say it just satisfied our needs. But after tonight's weary conditions, we are recharged! Hungry and tired, I guess I could have driven around Spring Mt. Road a few more times, as in search for the Holy Grail of Korean foods, but with a mob of hungry and tired mouths in the back seat, I am glad I made the decision to order to go, and eat back in our room with a hotel movie. It's the smiles and looks of satisfied stomachs that acknowledged me to be once again, the "Man" of our cave, and perhaps the possibility of running to be the leader of the Clan someday.  As for the movie we watched for $16.99 in our room ? (One that is currently renting for $1.20 on Red Box) . . . Did I tell you about the time ...
3 I hate to just give 3 stars to new opening restaurants. But this place just didn't have anything to excite me. We had ginseng chicken soup, Bibimbap and cold bean soup noodle. Everything tasted very bland. Ginseng chicken soup tasted almost like water. It was much needed to be cooked longer!!! Each one of us got complimentary cold ginger drink after the meal. It was refreshing and smooth. I will probably give it a second chance after several months. Hopefully, I can find something yummy to feed my tummy.
5 The menu has a variety of different dishes which I liked to begin with. The service was friendly and the portions were quite good.  But best of all, the food was great! I think we've found our new place to eat Korean food when in Vegas!  Sometimes when I see 1 star reviews, I can't help but think it might just be a competitor! Was he at the right restaurant? LOL.
1 I would just like to preface my review with the fact that I LOVE KOREAN FOOD.  I am huge fan of Korean food actually.  My family ended up coming here because we couldn't get a table at Monta Ramen and we were really hungry.  The outside of this restaurant is filled with PICTURES of food.  The name said DELICIOUS, so we said, "why not.  Let's do it!"   THAT WAS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE WE MADE THAT NIGHT!   I got the Oxtail Soup.  They gave me a side of salt and I was wondering why.  Well, when my soup came, it was sizzling hot, and tasted like hot water.  No amount of the salt made that soup taste like ANYTHING.  The bibimbap barely had any meat.  THIS WAS THE WORST Korean restaurant I have ever been to.  The food had no flavor whatsoever.  I returned the soup because I was outraged that a soup would have NO TASTE! She said it was because it was just the bone that they boil and I was supposed to put a red sauce on it.  I just wanted a soup and I don't care where in the world you go, a soup is supposed to have flavor in it!   It was the most absurd thing.  After I returned my soup, our waitress NEVER came back to our table, yet we see her sitting with other patrons and chitchatting with them and we had to actually walk up to the front to get our check.    It was absurd to name a place DELICIOUS and have no flavor in the food they serve.  STUPID PLACE!
1 This is not Korean food. Bad taste for expensive price. Never coming back, ever. please do not come here.
1 Food? Delicious? Korean? Yeah right. This place serves the most disgusting food. Its not food for humans, its food for dogs!!! !!!.....
