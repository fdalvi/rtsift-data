2 Three appointments  with a wait over an hour each before seeing doctor one was one hour and 20 mins I walked out  didn't get a call afterwards or any kind of apology guess it biz as usually there no mas
1 Wait time is awful! Always an hour or more. I walked out of my last appointment before even seeing Dr. Mannino because the wait had been too long. I've been coming here for over 10 years but now I think it's time to move on. No follow up on labs, no appointment reminders, not professional at all!
1 Horrible, negligent, incompetent and unprofessional medical staff. Staff at the front are joking around laughing instead of doing their job. Patients wait for prescriptions to be called in for days because and when they call in, they speak to someone who is incompetent and doesn't care what your issue it. It's not until you submit a complaint to the medical board and nursing board that they get themselves in to gear and start taking your health and treatment seriously. Do not put your health in the hands of these practitioners or their staff. You will be neglected and they could care less.
