4 Nifty oasis at The Clarendon Hotel in Phoenix. Sophisticated restaurant is paired with a slick bar. Good place to put on a low-key shine on Friday or Saturday night.
5 A cool moody bar hangout with an ecletic scene of characters? In Phoenix?   My baby's alls growns up now.
4 I stayed at the Clarendon on business a few weeks ago and my boss and I ate at Camus.  It was empty, due to the MNF game b/w the Bears and Cardinals, but the chef was really cool and made some great food.  The foie gras creme brule was rich and delicious, as was the polenta.  YUM!
4 Like the bar.  Did not experience the restaurant food or the music in the bar.  Staff is friendly and efficient.    I did try the creme brulee...coconut creme brulee.  It was very good.  I had an extensive conversation with the chef regarding sushi -- he was previously a sushi chef.  If you go to the Clarendon's website, there are some great restaurant referrals in Phoenix.
4 Very cool place inside a very cool hotel that I never knew existed.   The Clarendon is like the indie step-brother to the clean cut Valley Ho in Scottsdale. Which makes Camus the counterpart to Trader Vic's, an equally impressive but slightly more expensive alternative.   The menu at Camus is flavorful and varied, with all sorts of influence from down home to panasian. I highly recommend the sweet potato fries and the tilapia wrap along with some sort of foreign beer for dinner. It's a can't miss.  What's most impressive about this place is that it's located in Phoenix. It serves as a testament that beneath its plastic surface, Phoenix is nurturing an independent and artistic scene that is quickly becoming recognizable and bordering on formidable in the national cityscape.   Definitely a great stop for out of towners or naysayers: Phoenix is on the up and up!
5 i came after hours for drinks at the bar here after a biz party in the area. located in the Hotel Clarendon, which has been around for a very long time but has def gotten in a cool baby face lift recently.  the bar is uber chic but fun every once in a while for that scene. as an added note, the hotel is an important part of AZ history, as an Arizona Republic reporter was murdered in the parking lot, by car bomb, for his work covering the mob in phoenix (yes, phoenix in the 70s was run by a serious network of greedy officials with mob ties). he was the first American reporter to be killed on U.S. soil in retaliiation for his work.  that is your AZ history lesson for the day. camus kicks ass, that is all.
5 Two words- grilled pears. In the words of Rachel Ray- YUMMO. Go here...you'll enjoy it!!!
3 Um...there's food?  After a hellish taxi ride from Tempe to Phoenix (note: the atm across the street at desert schools spits out a FIFTY DOLLAR BILL if you ask for 50 bucks!), I couldn't believe how close this hotel/bar is to my usual CenPho hotspots! 3rd Ave and Clarendon? That is spittin distance from the Chez Nous! But I mean..who like goes down 3rd Ave, you know?  A beacon of prettiness in the desert, I was ushered into a lounge/bar that was actually pretty small. The low ceilings give a cosy but kind of clausterphobic feeling. I asked for a drink from the bartender, a kind of recommendation or specialty he had, and that I liked Gin. Um..he had like nothing really to offer? And I ALWAYS get G&T, but so many people raved about this place I was like, C'MON there has got to be some kind of hot drinks this ultra-chic lounge serves? I ended up with this kind of lime rickey martini that normally has vodka and he replaced with bombay that was pretty bomb-and the drink WAS HUGE. And not too expensive if I remember correctly (and I don't-b/c I bought two of those and a JD shot that he had overflowing- a shot? more like a full frontal machine gun assault?) .  The stools were high and the booths were pretty comfy-although I TOTALLy had SwampAss (or Swass) when I got up. This place was crammed wall to wall with hot gay guys. I think I saw a couple ladies but they were there for a hot gay guys birthday party that we all sang to-so there you are. I finally staggered around the space and discovered what I guess is the restaurant where people eat food at normal not too fancy two seaters. We went outside to a tiny lil seated patio to see a nice sky and balcony.  I wanted to see more of the hotel and ended up getting cited for having my libation near the pool (whoopsy!), but I was so psyched for the retro yellow loungers (ca-yute) and look inside the lil hotel rooms where the knobs (hehe) have the Clarendon Hotel symbol.  I thought this place was super cute, and I wouldnt mind meeting for drinks to kick off the night or trying some of the food. But it wasn't the mind blowing experience I thought it would be?
4 A little piece of Scottsdale hotel bar minus the attitude....Review of drinks only....  I find this to be one of the better bars in Central Phoenix.  Trendy space.  Cool red lighting.  Great, friendly service.  Good drinks.  Not much to complain about here.  They actually have a modest yet cool drink list, but not much to offer regarding gin.  Sorry, gin lovers...lol.  Drinks are generous.  Bonnie could probably fit her face in a martini glass.  A friend who works in north Phoenix routinely recommends his discerning colleagues stay at the Clarendon.  Distance is not an issue, apparently. Not familiar with the hotel rooms ...although I've looked at the model rooms and they look WAY Gen-X chic.  I've been here on other occasions - last time was more of a gay crowd, (Thursdays are ad agency industry night) but other times - NOT at all.  That's part of the egalitarian Central Phoenix culture.  Not much of a surprise if you frequent places in the neighborhood.  Cute patio for smoking.  Good to note, post May 1,2007.
3 I don't share the enthusiasm for Camus as the past reviewers. While I agree with them on the food, it is top-notch, the service wasn't all that when I stopped in for dinner.   We sat at the bar and were half-heartedly greeted by the bartender with an attitude. My friend loves Chambord so we asked him what he could make to which he rolled his eyes and only offered a French Martini. This was surprising because I had heard from friends how the bartenders were creative and extremely knowledgable.   And although it wasn't crowded, it took an extra long time for us to receive our food. He didn't even bring our salads out first! He waited to bring them ourwith the main meals.   I plan to give this trendy place a second change because I did love our entrees and everyone just raves about Camus. Hopefully the waiter from hell has moved onto work at Denny's.
4 g00d motr re virfeew when i sober up....   ok long story I found out this bar/food is now called C4 read the more sobered up review there...  VP
