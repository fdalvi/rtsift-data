4 I just moved to Arizona from Alaska and we did not have any Jack In the Box there...  Can we say delicious!! I am a huge fan of the breakfast menu! When I went here I ordered the bacon burger on the sourdough bread and fries. I was not entirely impressed with that particular sandwich just because I'm not a big sourdough bread fan but wanted to try something different. The fries were absolutely delicious though!! The service at the drive thru was excellent and freindly not your average here is your food blah blah blah.   McDonalds who? I will be back for more Jack In the Box!
4 Its 2am and you are hungry, you are way the hell out in the NW valley.  Guess what?  You are eating here because nothing else is open.  We even had breakfast here Thanksgiving morning on my way to the AZ Auto Show and guess what....they were the only place open.  Its simple, food is decent fast food and its always open.  At 2am I recommend 10 tacos, for breakfast I recommend the sausage, egg, and cheese croissant sandwich.  Service is fast food they are always nice here, the place is clean inside and you really cant ask for much else, if you do you suck.
4 Can't beat the service. Clean and very nice Associates here. Service with a smile and good folks. Dining area is small and kinda cold but done very well with expensive fixtures but doesn't fit a Jack in th Box. Who cares. Good food and good service.
4 Tacos, bacon burger, and curly fries. Late night grub that hits the spot every time. Service was quick, and the employee was nice. There are a couple other Jack in the Boxes in the area and this one is far better. Drive an extra couple miles to go to this one.
