3 I went there this weekend for my girlfriend's senior prom; the staff was really friendly and helpful. I got the standard king bed room, it wasn't fancy but it did the trick. There prices are good; I might go back someday.
2 Stayed on a business trip seeking to save money on the nightly rate. Spending $10 more a night would have been worth it to book another room. Rooms were old, TV was junky and bathrooms were ok. The staff was pleasant and helpful. The location was perfect.  Skip the complimentary breakfast as the choices are slim and offerings looked old. Complimentary coffee was a nice touch if you could pour more than 1 oz. at a time.  Good location, low prices, below par rooms. I'd recommend spending a few bucks more to stay at Comfort Inn or Holiday Inn.
1 Unfortunately, we had to stay here during the week of Epic's UGM 2013 conference.    My room was dirty.  The rooms had a stale, mildew smell.  The shower/tub looked like it had a layer of grime that needed a lot of scrubbing and disinfectant.    The few positives about this place are: 1) free HBO; 2) it is located near a handful of restaurants.    I hope this will be my first and last time staying in an Econo Lodge.  Ugh.
