1 Don't come here if you have curly hair! The hairdresser I had didn't have a clue how to cut it. For example, she used a razor (which you're definitely supposed to do with curly hair). To be fair, she is getting her real estate license. Hopefully she leaves hair cutting soon and never returns.  And let's all hope she is better at selling houses.
3 Went here to get a a young man's haircut and the price was right, the haircut was exactly what was ordered.  Can't go wrong with that, especially considering he needs a haircut every 6 weeks.
5 I have three boys (6,4,1) who needed cuts. Stopped in here by chance since we dont have a hair dresser in az yet. Ashley was awesome! She took her time and was paitent with my fidgeting boys.  Their hair cuts are exactly what I asked for. They were happy I was hapoy. They boys even recieved a free token for a bouncey ball which jusg made it more exciting for them. The price was awesome. Under 25 for all three. I have paid up to 80 for them before. Great service short wait time lots of paitence amazing price. We will be back.
5 I just had my first appt. with CORTNEY today. And all I can say is fabulous, fabulous, fabulous!!!  She listened to all of my concerns (which were many), made expert recommendations and came up with a direct plan of action based on experience, not guessing (imagine that!). The result was glorious, luxurious color and shine, shine shine!!!  Please do not use her, I want to be able to get an appointment!
5 Awesome Salon with great staff! New owners took it over in June and have done great job with it... Everyone should give them a try.
