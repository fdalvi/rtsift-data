4 8/6/13 I picked up two suits I had altered at Just Fine Alterations located in East Towne Mall.  They did a great job for me.  They're open 7 days a week.  Their turn around time from start to finish is fast.
4 They hem pants in an hour and they're open on Sundays. What's not to love? I've had two pairs of pants hemmed here (when you're short all of the pants you buy are going to need to be hemmed) and both times they've done them in an hour while I walked around East Towne Mall. Plus their prices are on the lower end of the spectrum. Quick, cheap and efficient. Win-win.
4 I brought a slew of clothes.  One was a glove with a torn knit cuff, a high school winter jacket needing letters sewn on, a sports jersey, rayon superhero button down shirt and a jacket that needed a zipper replacement.  They did all of them in three days, at a reasonable price AND a fantastic job.  They also do military uniforms!
