3 Just came here for a drink on a Sunday afternoon and it was just all families taking their elderly parents out for some food. Certainly wouldnt go out of my way to come back but it must be handy for people who live nearby as there's no alternative!    The menu also looked like it made more of an effort than your standard pub food.
3 This pub/restaurant is just a few hundred metres down the road from the King's Buildings campus of Edinburgh University. I visited with a group of seven for a Tuesday lunch, and the conservatory style restaurant was dotted with patrons  mostly older folk. Braidburn Inn offers a substantial menu, more varied and better prepared than your standard pub fare, but at a slightly inflated cost (approx Â£12-15 per main)  however the servings are giant and (mostly) very tasty and the table service is very good, so it is worth the extra pennies. They have some very good daily specials too. The cullen skink, bruschetta and thai prawn starters were massive hits, as were the Highlander chicken main (complete with very thick cut, tasty home made fries) and pink panther desert (think berries, ice cream and meringue!); however according to my fellow patrons, the baguette wasn't up to scratch and the steak and ale pie was a little below par. The coffee (no flatwhite on the menu here sorry folks!) was actually rather good, and served with a very delicious piece of fudge. While it may not be the best place in town, it offers more than your average pub, in a slightly more refined (if somewhat staid) setting with brilliant service. Perfect for taking visitors to the Kings Buildings campus out for lunch, or for a dinner out for a local. They also run a quiz night on Thursdays apparently  get in!
