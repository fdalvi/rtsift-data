5 Good prices and great hair cuts/color!!
4 I'm from out of town, walked in here after not having my hair cut in a couple months, talked to Candy, sweet oriental lady who owns the place.  She cut my hair and did a very nice job... And a fair price so I left a decent tip in appreciation for taking me in as a walk in...
5 Like one of those awesome hole in the wall restaurants- this is your awesome hole in the wall place to get your hair. Comfortable atmosphere, friendly staff, and all the product you need :)
5 I've been coming here for years! Candy is very nice and always takes me in whenever I need a fix, even when I don't have an appointment. I suggested her to my mother awhile back and she's been a repeat customer as well.
