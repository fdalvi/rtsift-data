5 I will never get ink/toner at an office supply store again.  I save at least $25 every time I get a toner cartridge for my HP Laserjet.  The service with these ladies is unmatched at ANY business I frequent.  They go the extra mile every time to make sure I get what I need.  Don't hesitate.  If you have a blinking red light on your printer, get your cartridge over to Cartridge World!
4 I love this place. Not only does it save me money but they stand behind their product. I have purchased several cartridges from them and I had one that I thought was bad, I took it back and they exchanged it no problem. (I found out it was a bad print head and not a bad cartridge later)  I have sent several friends there and one of them told me that they were told to buy new cartridges because the they would not be happy with the refills for that printer. (They don't sell that cartridge new)  That type of honesty as well as their prices will keep me coming back.
5 This store was awsome!  The customer service was impeccable, they really knew what they were talking about.  Additionally, I was able to save a ton of money.  I will never pay full-price for ink again!  I would recommend all of my friends and co-workers to refill their ink here.
4 Love the customer service at this facility.  Not only are prices comparable with the big name businesses, but nothing comes close to the people who work there.  They are very helpful and a very concerning about ones time.
1 If you want to go and be over charged, or you like the switch and bait plan then this is the store for you. When I called and asked about their prices they stated "our prices are the same as refilling your ink cartridge" BUT when I got there they wanted to charge me $1.oo less than retail. Order your ink on line, ALOT cheaper.
