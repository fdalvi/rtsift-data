5 Located inside Central Christian Church, you can get your Starbucks fix as well as various Christian books and music, kinda like a condensed version of Barnes and Noble. The "242" comes from the book of Acts (Acts 2:42) according to one worker.  Goes perfectly with the amazing, upifting services here at Central....Happy Birthday Jesus! ALOHA!!!!

5 Starbucks products at church for a yummy service!  I like the fact that everyone who works there does it for free and all of the profits go directly to the church.  Love!
5 I love my church! Where else can you find a starbucks shop inside a church?  Why the name Two42?  It's derived from the Bible.. Acts 2:42 " All the believers devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, and to fellowship, and to sharing in meals and to prayer."  Perfect place to meet other people for fellowship before service. =)
4 I like to order a coffee and grab a book to read when I visit on Friday nights. While I don't attend church at Central, I have found the people and staff I have encountered to be incredibly nice and welcoming. The coffee is good too!
4 Ordered two bagels, a blueberry muffin, 2 fresh ice teas, and a frappacino.  All great!  Makes for a nice meeting spot before the busy service.  Only suggestion-- a nice young lady tries to assist the long line by taking orders before you reach the counter, which actually seems to clog up the line and/or lead to further confusion.  Good seection of books in the bookstore.
