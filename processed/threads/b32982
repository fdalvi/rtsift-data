1 At the beginning of June 2013, I started looking for a second home in the Las Vegas area. I am from Colorado. Obviously there are so many homes available here that I had a plethora of homes to choose from.   In the end, I chose a home to lease from UMG/AMG (United or American Management Group). This has become my WORST decision of 2013!   1. None of the appliances work properly, including the maggot filled refrigerator it took them over a week to replace.   2. The oven doesn't shut off so I can't use it and has been deemed a hazard to our health and lives by the gas company.   3. The Washing machine stops mid-cycle with soaking wet loads of clothes yet it says that it doesn't have an adequate amount of water to complete the load.   4. The 2nd bathroom sink cannot be used because there is only a faucet. No knobs to turn on the water. Just a bowl & two holes for the handles to turn on the water. It's been 3 weeks!!!   5. My closet pole was cut short of the hole in the wall so I can't hand up all my clothes.  6. There is no garage door opener so I have to drive out of my garage, shut off my truck, walk back thru the garage to shut the garage door, walk out of the front door every single time I want to leave and when I come back home.  Side note: How hard is it to get a simple remote???  7. Toilet seat in Master bedroom is missing a bolt to hold the seat down.  8. Toilet paper holder in half bath is missing hardware on one side which would keep it secure to the wall  9. Carpet was soiled and VERY dirty@move-in YES, I trusted this Property Management company to have clean carpet at my move-in from a thousand miles away!   10. Several window screens were missing or in disrepair (REPLACED BY HOA which had nothing to do with the property management company.) They don't even know that they've been replaced.   11. I asked for weeks about my mailbox key with no answer. I finally called the Post office last week and just had to take them my lease proving residency. WHY DON'T THEY KNOW TO TELL THEIR TENANTS THAT!!! THEY ARE THE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COMPANY HERE!!!  As you can see, I have been in a living hell. They have our money and are taking their sweet time at completing the most mundane of tasks.  I keep having to email them and call them because they are not getting things taken care of.   They said that they are trying to get $$$'s off August rent because of all that I have had to go through, yet no word yet on how much or if they are even going to do it. I had to live here for a week or more with no hot water, no refrigerator and no working stove or oven. And I'm still living with no working oven.   At this point, I truly suggest you find another property management company for your rental needs as this company does not take care in renting quality homes or fixing what's broken or non-operable in them. Everything is on Work Order. What the HELL does that mean...nearly a month later!!!   DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!  Heather is not a helpful or IMHO,  a nice person. Jesus seems like a nice person but unfortunately cannot seem to really get anything done. I like him and I'm hoping that it's out of his power to do so but regardless, things are still not getting done.  We gave UMG over $3,000 to move into this Townhome but were rudely accused by Heather of not paying a measly $46.50. It turns out that she put the wrong total on the lease. She made the error in calculations. We just paid what was on the signed lease.
5 6:30 pm ON 7/17/2013 I HAVE TO SAY THAT I AM THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED WITH UMG'S COMEBACK. THEY HAVE TAKEN CARE OF JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ON MY LONG LAUNDRY LIST.   EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BUT THE GUY ABOUT MY OVEN HAD TO ORDER A PART AND WILL BE BACK TOMORROW BETWEEN 3 & 5.   I AM A PERSON THAT BELIEVES THAT EVERYONE DESERVES TO BE TRUSTED UNTIL THEY SHOW YOU DIFFERENT AND EVEN IF THEY MESS UP, IF THEY THEN SHOW YOU THAT YOU CAN TRUST THEM, THEN I DO.   VERY HAPPY TODAY. FINALLY!!! A GARAGE DOOR OPENER IN THIS VEGAS HEAT!!! ***********************************************************************************  EARLIER IN THE MORNING OF 7/17/2013: The same day I wrote the original review, I also sent an email to the Property Management Company.   Later that afternoon, I received a call from Liz the Director of the company who expressed surprise that I had gone through so much and assured me that this was not the normal business practices of the company.   I give everyone the benefit of the doubt until they give me reason to distrust their word so I do believe her. She asked several questions and assured me that all the items on my "laundry list", would be addressed.   Before she called, I was contacted by a contracting company for an appointment for today between 3-5 to come out and fix several of the issues.   I have upped my star rating from 1 to 3 for the quick follow-up and service appointment.   Hopefully, UMG can be bumped up to 4 or 5 stars very soon.   Keep your fingers crossed.
5 8/1/2013 update: UMG, reduced my rent by 50% for the month of August. They get 2 thumbs up and a very satisfied tenant. They really went above and beyond to right every wrong in this situation. No one could ask for more.   everything has been repaired.  nothing but respect for a company who makes good on their word.  i'm a happy camper!!!  Major Props to Jesus, my angel, Liz the director and last but not least, Patricia the gatekeeper. They took care of me.
1 If you are a home owner looking for a property management company, avoid UMG at all costs.  We have dealt with them for 3 years now and it has been a miserable experience.  We are in the process of taking our business elsewhere.  Terrible communication skills, poor management, and an overly tenant centric approach.  Staff turnover is very high and you will rarely speak to the same property manager.  Please heed our advice and go elsewhere.
1 DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THEM! Find a place that will not take advantage of you and that you know you can trust because if they can take your money they will. Very unreliable and untrust worthy. Deceitful customer service and you never know if the person your speaking to is actually in charge. Not consistent and if you receive the wrong info YOU WILL PAY. Spoke to a man who assured me the date I scheduled my bill pay would not cause me to receive a fee. Sent out rent and was no problem. One month later bill pay sends out the rent a day later due to a holiday and they charge me stating that the rent shld have be be received PRIOR to rent due and NoTsent out prior which was not what I was originally told. Apparently the two men I spoke to before about this situation were BOTH fired or left the company when i told them what i was told they said that Ishould have asked for a supervisor and will not give me my fee back. I was under the empression that these were the people in charge of these situation since they were who I was tranfered to. Although I was careful and even pay  extra for rent every month they do not appreciate the business of their customer.. A single mother working two jobs and they take my money with a smile and brush me off. I expressed to them that I didn't understand how I am paying for the mistake of their employees.  They apologized and said  that they do not usually run their business this way yet they still refuse to refund me the fee stating "i will speak to my supervisor but i know they will not waive the fee. ironically enough I was under the impression that I was already speaking to a supervisor. Now I have to spend the  remainder of my lease on edge because I can not trust them and I have broken fans and curtains that have not been fixed. These were broke the day I moved in (6months ago) and they still haven't fixed them. The possibility of them blaming me are higher and higher everyday they neglect this situation. I wish I knew how deceitful they were before I moved in. If you do decide to do business with them make sure you include a third party..preferably a lawyer. Not joking. It may be the only way you won't be taken advantage of.
1 I've have been with UMG for 3 years. I'm also a REALTOR. I've seen the company go from being great, to being terrible. If I call or send an email I usually don't receive a response but if I do, it's over a month later! BEWARE of this company they just take your money and do nothing. I'm switching to a different company right away.
1 I am a property owner, I had them for 1yr....I do not recommend them!!!! Find some one else you will be thankful! We live out of town, they were not helpful at all. I had to manage them which is really hard when they dont return any phone calls or emails, and they go through people all the time.
