5 favorite vintage rentals and prop styling business in the las vegas area! Veronica pays special attention to detail when explaining exactly what you're looking for. She's extremely sweet and friendly, oh & of course CREATIVE! I definitely recommend nostalgia resources for styling weddings, engagement, bridal, portrait, family and lifestyle sessions in las vegas.

5 I love Nostalgia Resources!  They have quality vintage pieces at a right rental price for your budget!  Veronica and her husband are wonderful to work with.  They are very nice, friendly, accomodating, talented and has a great taste! They have so many interesting and mind blowing vintage collections.   I rented their gorgeous settee (Dolores) and vintage suitcases for my wedding!  We used it for our ceremony and moved it to the reception.  All our guests had fun having pictures on this settee!  It was really beautiful.    I sincerely recommend them for vintage rentals!
