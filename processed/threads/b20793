4 Whether it is January and you are very white or if it is July and you just want to look as though you have just got back from holiday, the Tan Stand is the place to go. There are several Tan Stands in Edinburgh and the one on South Clerk Street is very popular with the University students. Sun beds are available as well as an impressive range of spray and fake tans available. The tans are all very reasonably priced, with just 5 minutes on the sun bed costing around £2 and spray tans are available at £15. Because trained therapists spray you, there is absolutely no chance of you getting the awful streaks and patches which so frequently occur with  fake tans.   The staff are very friendly, inviting and knowledge about the various tanning options available to the customers.  There is also a beauty salon attached to The Tan Stand which offers a range of therapies such as manicures, eyebrow shaping and waxing, which is also extremely well priced - about £5-8. There is no need to make an appointment and I frequently walked in and been served immediately. It would be difficult to find a cheaper tanning and beauty salon in Edinburgh.
4 Clean facilities and very simple. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, taking care to inform me that the lamps in the sun beds were brand new and therefore quite hot and I could get burned more easily. It's extremely affordable, starting at only £1.50 for 3min in the sun bed. A quick, cheap, easy treat in an easy-to-find location.
