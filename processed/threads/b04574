4 My family and I have been coming to Target Optical for many years now, you want to know why?  Great Customer Service, specifically Clarissa!  Clarissa has so much patience and handled showing my daughter how to put her contacts on for the first time so effortlessly.  We have never had bad customer service at this location regardless of the employee.    Target offers discounts on frames for their customers 18 and under.  If using a vision insurance along with a cash purchase for multiple glasses, contacts or both some representatives will automatically look for the best price available.  Alway negotiate, the more skilled reps will find a way to get you what you need within your budget.  At least it has worked out this way for my family.     Unless something goes horribly wrong you will alway have great customer service at this location.  My favorite employee has been transferred to the Arrowhead store.
