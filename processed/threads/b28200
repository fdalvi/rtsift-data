5 I've been a fan of Sheila Fleet jewellery for many years and I even wrote about her collections in one of my Higher Art exams at school. One of my friends got The Sands of Time necklace and ring set for her 21st birthday and for my Christmas a few years ago she bought me the super cute Secret Hearts necklace and seeing as I love all things with hearts on them it's one of my favourite pieces of jewellery.  Sheila Fleet jewellery is perfect if you want to give someone a Scottish souvenir and the pieces are classic and aren't naff like some other more unimaginative souvenirs. The inspiration for all the collections come from Orkney and Sheila works with silver, and 18ct gold and many of the pieces have enamel too. Some pieces have a really obvious Scottish connection while others are a bit more subtle.  Something a little bit different and great for all ages too.
4 The Sheila Fleet Gallery showcases a range of pretty jewellery, which is crafted up in Orkney. The specialities here are silver, gold and enamel, and the designs are the kind you look at, and instantly recognise as something a bit different. This clearly isn't a collection of mass manufactured, churned out jewellery, the pieces here are pretty unique and have a distinct style that isn't like anything on the high street.  The celtic influences in a lot of the jewellery are clear, with designs related to the ocean featuring significantly, with a lot of blue coloured tones running through the jewels. There is both classic and contemporary to choose from here, and as a personal favourite, the beautiful gemstone rings are welcome to adorn my hands any day.
