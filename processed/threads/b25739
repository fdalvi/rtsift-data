5 I've been to Sunrise on several occasions and have had a great experience every time. Their bagels are the best in the valley (I recommend the Cheddar bagel) and the breakfast sandwiches are fresh and tasty. The space is clean and bright with wonderful art all around, all the owners are always friendly and obviously passionate about their store and customers.  Skip the chain restaurants and support a great local business!

5 I have been coming here since the first week it opened on Signal Butte. The bagels are homemade and are delicious. My favorite item are the breakfast bagels (Arizona Bagel is my fave), but we also come here for lunch and the sandwiches are very good too. They even make a pretty good hamburger! Coffee is freshly ground and very flavorful.  The owners are very dedicated to their shop, and they love to talk with patrons. They remember me and what I order, which is a great sign that they pay attention to and appreciate their customers. You definitely need to try them.
