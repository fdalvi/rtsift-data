4 Brand new business...family owned, great atmosphere.  The cappuccino and sandwich were excellent!  WI-FI too.
4 Great espresso! They actually pull shots on a real semi-auto espresso machine (unlike starbucks), so it requires skill to make a drink. I was very impressed with my americano.  The atmosphere was warm and friendly, and it was a great place to spend a few hours working on my laptop.   Bonus is that there is free Wi-fi (ask for the password) but the downfall is there are only two receptacles to plug into. They were kind and accomodating enough to move some furniture for me to access a top-secret hidden plug though.  Not sure if they actually roast their own beans (yet). I read an article that they were planning to roast in the future, but not sure if it's happening yet. Either way, above-average coffee in Waterloo Region.
5 Great coffee!  Excellent atmosphere, friendly service. Highly recommended.
5 Great coffee, nice pastries to go with the coffee and nice atmosphere. I love this place on Saturday morning with my girl. She loves the beautiful designs they swirl into her hot chocolate :)
