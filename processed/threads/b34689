5 I tried this with one of those online coupons. I wanted to save this one for the moment I was almost done with my thesis. It took me a while to schedule an appointment, but after insisting a couple of times and also getting messages back from the owner/masseur, I finally got my day.   My experience was amazing. I never felt uncomfortable and despite the touch was precise to release the tension, I never felt terrible pain or an effect after. I was glad that my skin was moisten with organic oils and not just left with oily stuff. At some point I had some hot stones around my neck area and shoulders which helped so much to release the rocks I had there. Thank you PCM!!
5 OMG!  I have to say that this is the only place that could help me with my excruciating leg and back pain.  I immediately felt some relief after the first visit.  I've been to other physical therapists and chiropractors but none of them seemed to know what to do.     Love the way she combined different massage techniques. Pain is gone, but I will definitely return for a relaxing massage!   Many thanks to my friend Helen for recommending.
