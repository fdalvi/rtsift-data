4 Super cute clothes, super cheap prices!  I absolutely love little boutiques like this with non-boutique prices :)
3 Good merchandise, crappy customer service. I don't want to hear you and your coworker talk about what you're doing for Halloween while you cash me out. At least wait til I walk away. Shame.
5 Customer service is great!
