4 Been going here for years.  Simple sandwiches, good price.   Notthing gourmet, but not franchised cardboard either.  Always get the turkey sub with everything on it, cold, with a drink and some chips.
4 This is a wonderful locally owned and operated sandwhich shop. Great unique style. Been going since I was in High School!
4 Great local favorite sub shop. Simple and fantastic.
4 I've lived in this neighborhood my entire life but tried Ned's for the first time about a couple of weeks ago. It's a favorite around the area so I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm typically not a huge sandwich fan but I actually thought it was pretty good. The hubs and I shared the super samich and it wasn't bad. The guy working was really nice and helpful so this past week I decided to grab one on my way into work. I called the order in but when I went to pick it up realized I had called the order into the location on Southern, not the location on McKellips. OOPS! The guy working was super nice about it and made me a new one right there, in just a couple of minutes! It was very fast, friendly service and I was surprised at how understanding they were about the mix up. I will definitely be going back again and again!
4 Excellent sammiches. Plain n simple, delicious. As good as jimmy John's but this place has nothing on CHEBA HUT.   The sandwiches are tasty, price is ok. This place beats subway any day.
4 Great value sub sandwiches!! Love going here with a sweet location.
4 Good subs at an expected price.  This place is classic.  I used to walk here from my house when I was a little kid and get their pizza boat and play dig dug or spy hunter.  Not much has changed since then.  Just their prices and the arcade games.
5 I always buy my sandwich from neds on mckellips. I have had good service from all the employees and family members over the years.   Try the torpedo samich.
1 Many problems with this place.   Bread is chewy and NOT fresh.  Want pickles on your sandwich? 35 cents more. Black olives? 25 cents more.  I was nickle and dimed to arrive home and dig in to a very lack luster sandwich.  Sorry Ned, I won't be back.
