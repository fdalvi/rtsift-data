4 We ordered delivery pizza for our first try of Barro's and it was good. Although for thin crust, the crispiness did not survive the drive.  I like the flavor and want to try eating in.  I am not a fan of most delivery pizza but this was good.
4 I love that this place has Gluten Free pizza.
4 Just like the pie i remember from chi town. if you want a "Chicago style pizza" this is the place for you. get the thin crust, you'll love it.
3 Went for lunch with my sister and was disappointed to see that they got rid of the salad bar and instead give you a lot of lettuce & croutons, a small amount of tomatoes and grated cheese.   Overall everything was very underwhelming. I also got a slice of veggie pizza which turned out to pretty much be mushroom only, good thing I love mushrooms, oh except they were very thin, not so fresh mushrooms. The service also could have been friendlier for sure.
2 food is good because it's Barros but the appetizers and salads come out with the pizza... this is the third time its happened. the location in QC is waaaay better.
5 Love their pizza. We order monthly and recommend their garlic sauce for dipping. Good prices and always friendly staff
5 I love barros. I am probably their best customer. I am there at least 3 times a week either getting a well priced beer or having my favorite pizza. I love that they actually know me when I come in. Great place and great food.
