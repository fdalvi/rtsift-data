1 I have been a patient at this office for about six months and have never had to deal with a variety of issues ranging from lack of follow through to just flat our neglect from this staff and the NPs there.  I don't even know why Dr. Green's information comes up in relation to this practice; he was readily available to me and my family when we were shopping physicians for our family but has been unavailable ever since.  Even if you request a visit with him it will be at least three to six months out; but if you call and ask to meet him for purposes relative to signing up as a new patient he will drop his pants for you as any salesman would.  You should know that you will only see NPs at this office; and not even professional, skilled NPs (I work in healthcare); they are very non-chalant and very unresponsive.  I am younger but that does not necessarily mean that I enjoy being called 'Dude' when I visit my MDs office.  Needed a referral twice and was unable to get them to send the paperwork on two occasions; the first time I went down to the office to pick up the referral was opposed to waiting for them to fax it, and now the second time has led me to drop the office and write this review.
4 I have been using this physician's office for about a year. I prefer Dr. Kerry Green. The 5-minute quick care for established patients has saved my life!
1 They didn't help me with anything and I went on 4 different occasions and still have the problem thanks for nothing
