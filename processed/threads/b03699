2 Yes, its a step above fast food, but you pay for what you get. A few months ago I had one of their dinner plates and a drink, maybe an extra taco, and it was 11-something! For a few bucks more I coulda' gone to a sit-down joint and had REAL Mexican food! The food is pretty fresh and all that, but its rather bland and boring. I do like the salsa bar, load your own and take it to go thingy. They also have nice take out cups!
4 Chicken black bean burrito was surprisingly good. Their food has gotten better than it was in the past.
4 Used my @BoldBajaFresh @Groupon for lunch today.  I've always been a fan a Baja Fresh, and ate there quite often in CA.  The distance to the closest one here in AZ is excessive for regular visits.  I don't really know that they are worth reviewing, per se, but I wanted to relate my experience today at this particular location.  The chips we were given seemed stale to both my g/f and I. The manager took my old chips, and grabbed a new bag to hand me. Rather than proceed with that action, he also discarded them, and informed me he would make up a new batch, and deliver a double order to our table.  They came out hot and fresh, and delicious!  It was a nice display of customer service, an increasingly rare trait these days.  Thanks!
3 Quality of this fast food is better than most.  Tortilla used for the burrito was delightfully soft and a bit flour-y, and the frijoles con queso inside were tasty.  Prices not bad.  Salsa bar could use some improvement.  Seating is decent inside, but parking is bad so just give up and park in the grocery store lot nearby.
3 Baja Fresh is not Chipotle Mexican Grill, not even close. But, what they are is a interesting upscale casual Mexican fast food restaurant. They were owned by Wendy's for a time, and Baja Fresh executes on their menu items more often then most, Qdoba comes to mind.   The quality of the food is good, but only slightly above average. Their newer seafood items are very bland and clearly they were aiming at Rubio's (one of their misses).  Prices are fair, but their main unique entree is their Salsa Bar which is very fresh and also very good!  The problem for the chain is that their locations are sometimes across the street from a Chipotle, as this one is.  I like the chain, but if I'm in my car I might drive pass them and go to Chipotle instead.  Sorry!
4 The food is very good, service is too.  I had the Steak and Shrimp bowl, my wife the Mango Chipotle Chicken Salad. Both were excellent. Great fresh salsa bar with Mango Salsa, jalapenos, and several types of hot and mild salsa. We will return.
3 After having some Baja Fresh at the San Diego Airport on a recent trip, I was in the mood to have it again, so I stopped by this location.  After browsing the menu, I decided to try something new and ordered a Nacho Burrito (Chicken, Jack & Cheddar cheese, Pinto Beans, Rice, Smoky Queso Fundido, Jalapenos, Salsa, $6.79). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UMDYX0_C9TWxkANMoXBxGg?select=AqQo_Yxp0xhQO5owbgCVow  While I was waiting for my food, I got some of the Spicy Salsa from the Salsa Bar. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UMDYX0_C9TWxkANMoXBxGg?select=2raPMLrsrXO_6CSOdqgmpw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UMDYX0_C9TWxkANMoXBxGg?select=8eIvV0n0FRIh3yvggahHwA  The Nacho Burrito was OK, not great.  I wasn't too impressed with it.  It has a lot of potential, but just didn't seem to be as tasty as I had imagined.  The Salsa, which was supposed to be Spicy, was mild....bummer.  Overall, it was an average visit for Baja Fresh.  Return Factor - 65%
2 The food is decent but this place is FILTHY! The bathroom had pee everywhere! The staff was just standing behind the counter while they were out of three kinds of beverages. It wasn't even during peak hours, they clearly don't ever clean up until closing time. I like the food but I'll never eat at a baja fresh again!
1 Easily the worst "burrito" I have ever had. It amazes my that anyone would choose to eat at this chain. I bet the rations they serve from the back of UN trucks to refugees is better.
2 What to say.  For those of you who want a quick review stop reading and just go to chipotle.  Interesting and wonderful how innovation and competition changes our perceptions.  When baja fresh first opened it was pretty much the only quick Mexican food chain "game" in town and I thought it was good.  Then chipotle entered the game and the downgrade comparisons begin.  First the food is more expensive than chipotle but not higher quality.  For those with a healthy appetite, the quantity is also smaller.  We paid for our food and were given a ticket to wait for our food.  Chipotle again sets the standard as your food is prepared right in from of you while ordering and you get your food when you pay.  While on the subject of preparation, Baja does not provide any selection of ingredients for variety.  I know you can custom order a burrito, but it is not the same thing as seeing your food deliciously constructed before your eyes and being asked about each tasty new addition.  Finally there is the overall taste.  The burrito I had was good, but a touch greasy; very unlike the fresher taste of a chipotle burrito.  This baja restaurant lightly fried my burrito to give it a light browned appealing color.  Unfortunately the browning also dried out the tortilla too much.  Chipotle tortillas are always soft, warm, and taste like they were just rolled.  The only point that scored higher than chipotle was the salsa selection. Baja has a separate salsa bar where customers can serve themselves.  There is also a few more salsa types to select from.  I prefer the self serve option rather than having to wait behind other customers to ask for an additional bit of salsa  I've eaten at the baja fresh on university drive in Tempe and don't remember having the same less positive experience; but that was pre-chipotle too so perhaps it would be the same.  Ill let you know if I try this baja restaurant again and my experience is different  Happy eating
1 Ate there last night ...................       **********BLAND**********TASTELESS*********OVERPRICED**********        Don't believe me.........They're waiting for you
3 The funny thing for me and Baja Fresh is that I was never a huge fan. BUT... I became more of a convert after I saw the show "Undercover Boss" on CBS. The big message I took from it was the work that goes into the food and keeping things very fresh... especially for a "chain restaurant".   Big plus for me is definitely the "salsa bar". It's tough making a decision when there is a Chipotle directly across the street! And a more upscale Mexican food restaurant in the same shopping center (Pinatta Nueva).   The food here is good, not outstanding. I also think that it is a little pricey for what you get (portion wise). Given a choice.. I will try to seek out a Filiberto's any day of the week! (Please do not flame me for that comment!!!)    The other good thing about this location... is if you have some room left in your belly.. there is a Cold Stone directly next door for dessert!
1 Outdated. Dirty. Bad food.
1 Got there at 10:30am right when they opened, very first customer. The tables were dirty, The floors were dirty, Dead bugs at the soda fountain, I peeked behind the counter and their were dirty dishes everywhere and stagnant  water. At this point who cares what the food taste like.
2 Yikes.  The only reason this place gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because I think their Baja chicken burrito is super tasty &  their Mango Salsa.  Cons: The place is dirty (dont take my word, read the other reviews) The employees are always bullshitting until they rudely ask you what you want to order. The employees never offer suggestions, which may be an English Language barrier. The front door handle was broken my last time I went in here. Unreal. The burritos are likley to squirt and get extremely messy on the last few bites....sick.  Dont eat in the car unless you have a blanket in your lap, gross.   If Im craving a burrito, I will likely just go to the Chipotle across the street and wait in line for 15 mins VS this place....I think the only way Ill come back to this location is strait up steal their salsa and limes from their salsa bar.  This place would be better if they got friendlier harder working employees that actually cleaned the place up a bit.
2 I'm a big fan of atmosphere when I go to eat somewhere. I know, judging a fast food restaurant based on ambiance might be a little unfair, but hear me out.  Before we even made it into the restaurant, we were immediately on edge. The "hours of operation" sign, usually a corporate decal, had been replaced by hand-written hours scribbled on a strip of paper. Not only that, but the aforementioned sign was taped to the glass using the tape they use to close the wrappers on burritos http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baja-fresh-mexican-grill-scottsdale-2?select=VrHCIyrNYWFaRr8-G_D0Dw#VrHCIyrNYWFaRr8-G_D0Dw.  If that wasn't enough to put us on edge, there was the issue of the door. The handle was missing a bolt at the top, meaning that the handle swung back and forth if you touched it. When we left, this is what we saw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baja-fresh-mexican-grill-scottsdale-2?select=VrHCIyrNYWFaRr8-G_D0Dw#eHCSZ4a1Y3GzTaOIXTDucw.  This location was probably a shining gem when it opened. Those days, however, have long since passed...which is really unfortunate, because the food is actually pretty good. Not only that, but their outdoor patio area is really cool! It has heaters for the winter, and misters for the summer. So much potential...all lost due to lack of upkeep.  The years have not been kind to this building. Perhaps they could use some of the profits they're making off of their food and use it to maintain their facilities.
