2 I am really unhappy with the way the cut turned out. It was tapered poorly, and is noticeably shorter on one side than on the other. I used to go to an old fashioned barber shop near campus in my last city before I relocated here, and always got a decent cut there. Therefore I gravitated to Ray's ASU Barber Shop in order to get a haircut before classes started.    For a mere $12, the price isn't too bad, but for the same money I probably could have gotten a better cut at a chain.
2 I read some other reviews about how this place makes you feel comfortable and the staff being very friendly and having good conversation while getting your cut.  Now I haven't been to a barber in years so I'm not sure if this is the norm or not but here's my experience.    I walk in around 1:30 on a Wednesday there's one guy getting a haircut in there. I walk in a get a hello from  the barber and that's it.  So I sit down and grab a magazine.  There's some morning show on the tv, but given that it was a Wednesday afternoon I let it slide.  The guy getting his hair cut and the barber seemed to know each other well, and were having a good conversation.  A minute later another guy walks in, seemed to be another friend of the two guys and they all start talking.  About 10 min later some guy comes from the back room and asks "who's next" I got up and said hi, and i got a half hearted hi in return.  Now I had longer hair and as I said hadn't been to a barber in some time, so mostly I has going for a trim and to get it into some sort of style.  The guy asks how short I want it and I told him I wanted it kept fairly long.  He gives me a puzzled look, and then says "so about a inch to a half inch past the ear?" Sure I tell him.  He begins cutting.  He tries to ask me questions and I try to give him answers but our conversations end up going nowhere and there are long periods of silence throughout the hair cut.  Also, the entire time he is smacking his gum in my ear.  Eventually we get on the topic of fantasy football and stumble through that. Turns out he doesn't know much about football.  I tell him I also have a fantasy basketball team. He doesn't watch basketball.  I try to mention baseball in there just to see if I can get him to bite on something, but it turns out he doesn't know much about that either.  So much for the great conversation, what kind of barber doesn't know anything about sports?  As for the hair cut, remember I told him I wanted it left longer, and we agreed on that?  Guess he forgot, because my hair was much shorter than I had planned on it being.  It wasn't a terrible haircut but definitely not what I was hoping for.  At the end of it I get out of the chair and he stares at me a bit before telling me it's $12.  Needless to say I was pretty happy to get out of there.   Maybe it was the guy I got, or maybe that's just the way they run things at Ray's, but it was a pretty disappointing experience.  Seemed like he didn't have a clue as to other hair styles, and just went with his standard.  I don't think I'll be going back.
5 Since I moved to Tempe I have had no luck finding a regular place for a haircut.  One place in Mesa closed after two visits, one place charged me $17 and the other place never opens on time.  After waiting for 30 minutes I pulled out the droid and searched for another barbershop and opted to try Ray's.  Glad I did.  I'm not hard to please.  My cuts are always simple buzz cuts.  Ray's had a lot more to offer in terms of atmosphere.  The barbers were nice and the locals hanging out waiting for their services made the trip worthwhile.  We talked about baseball, the weather and local Mexican food joints.  Ray's ASU Barber Shop is one of those places that make going to the barber a cultural experience.  I will be going here from now on.
5 I've been coming to Ray's for well over 20 years, back when it was located on Mill & University.  The manager Charles (Ray's son), along with Lloyd, Barb, and others... take the time to get to know you, especially if you become a regular.  Usually some good barbershop convo, especially if Charles is around.  Never had a bad haircut from Charles, Lloyd or Barb.  Worth checking out especially if you're an ASU student, or live in the area.
5 I've been a customer of Ray's since my freshman year at ASU, 1983. I make it a point to try and get to Ray's whenever I'm in town, and I always leave w/ a great haircut and a smile.   PROS: old school attitude; friendly customers; reasonable price; Charles, Jerry, and my favorite barber of all time, Lloyd  CONS: more ESPN, less Modern Marvels (ha ha)  Ray's has a home town feel, and why wouldn't they? They are an ASU staple. I'm guessing they have taken care of damn near every ROTC cadet for the last 4 decades . . . Thanks guys!  Rich
5 Best razor edge old school  barber in the state. Pamela has been cutting my hair for over 25 yrs. I followed her from Guadalupe Barber Shop, she does the best military and flat tops! She is very funny , and her and Charles get the shop cracking up. You want a fade she's  the best !! She's a PRO !
5 Best straight razor barber in the state! Pamela has been cutting my hair for over 25 years , I followed her from the Guadalupe Barber Shop. She does the best military, razor fades and flat tops ! She is a PRO! She is not only cute but funny too !
4 Great haircut every time.  Right in line with competition for price too.  The barbers take their time to do it right, great place conversation to boot. Local gang, good Tempe talk if you're local. Only negative is the wait sometimes, but that's not their fault - they're that good and popular!
4 I got a great haircut from Pamela! The wait was short and the atmosphere relaxed.  I used to go to Great Clips but this was a superior experience in every way. She used a straight razor on the back of my neck and to straighten my sideburns, and we had a pleasant conversation that passed the time.  I would recommend Ray's.
5 Just went to Ray's today for my first haircut in college. I just got a standard buzz cut and everything went perfectly well. There was only a short wait, my haircut come out just how I wanted it to and the guy who cut my hair was nice and made the standard amount of small talk. It's definitely worth the 14 dollars I paid for it and I'll go there every time I need my hair cut.
5 In rebuttal to Loud S, what he failed to mention is the bald guy had his head shaved and was then moved to get his face shaved. The fact is if you just want a haircut and quality doesn't matter then go elsewhere. If you want a quality haircut then this is the place for you. It might take a little longer but they spend the same amount of time on everyone and will not allow you to leave with a bad haircut, they are dare I say perfectionists!!
