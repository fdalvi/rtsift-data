1 Soulless,   This is my second review of this place in as many weeks because I wanted to go back and see how consistent the food and the service were from my first trip.  God, have things changed.  My first review was glowing; I gave it four stars. Now, Soul Food Cafe barely earns one; here's why:  At my last visit, the meatloaf was among the best I've had anywhere in the country. You could savor the quality of the beef on your tongue as the meat mixed with the fat as it mixed with the spices as those mixed with the rich, dark gravy. It was that good. The gravy was the gold-plating on the dish. Most everything else that I or my girlfriend had was either very good or great (read first review below).  This time, however, the meatloaf was dry, hard almost like a roofing tile (I swear, I almost refused to pay for it) and came with no gravy (although I specifically asked for it). The black eyed peas tasted like a salt lick, and the rice and gravy was a warm, tasteless paste like the kind they'd serve us in elementary school. Gross.  The tea tasted like it came from a powder, the potato salad tasted old and I swear the chocolate cake this time could have come from a grocery store.  I'm not trying to slam these people. My first visit was incredible. In fact, I was psyched that Vegas finally had a great soul food restaurant. But in a matter of days this place has gone downhill. It tastes like what you'd get at some cafeteria that caters to folks in their 80s, where everything is stale, old and bland.  I'll give this place one more shot, but it'll be months before I do. These people had such a great start. They need to get it together before they lose more customers.  Read original review below:  Simmering in Soul  I wanted to marry the meatloaf. Right there on the spot, in front of the chef and everybody. I had only been there 10 minutes. Truth is, I didn't know what to expect from Soul Food Cafe, the newest such joint in the valley. My girlfriend and I have almost always been disappointed by the lesser-quality soul food spots in town, so we didn't have high hopes. But two bites into the meatloaf (in the picture I took here), and I felt like I was back home in the South, where we're steeped in gravy and simmered in iced tea. This place is the first soul food restaurant here where the high-quality ingredients match the ability of the chefs to churn out the kind of soul food that tastes like it's right out of your mama's kitchen. I think I'm on record about how great the meatloaf was - perfectly seasoned with a slight crust swaddling the thick, warm slices of soul on a plate. The mustard potato salad is the best I've had anywhere in Vegas at any restaurant, but the mac and cheese was a little dry. The book-size slab of chocolate cake, however, more than made up for it. My girlfriend had a perfectly fried piece of catfish with a side of sweet potatoes she loved and a dish of greens that while cooked with either smoked turkey or ham (it was hard to tell) tasted, she said, "flat and needed soul." That's a serious deficiency for a soul food restaurant, but the rest of the food is good enough to make up for the lapse. I should add that she ate her banana pudding so fast I barely got a look at it, much less a taste.  Lunches come with two sides; dinners come with three. All meals are also served with crispy, buttery cornbread cakes that are as good as any I've ever had anywhere in the country. That's not an overstatement. If, like us, you have a deep-seated love for soul food and have been disappointed by what's available in Vegas, you'll probably love Soul Food Cafe. They've only been open about a week, and they're obviously working out some kinks, but this is seriously good food at fair prices cooked by a staff who know what they're doing and have the skill to satisfy your hankerings. Oh, the wait staff is also very good: attentive, friendly, efficient. Give Soul Food Cafe a shot.  I know we'll be back soon.
4 I went here the first week they opened and it was great! I had the fried chicken meal with Mac and Cheese and Fried Okra as my sides and one of the delicious Kool-Aid drinks on the side. The fried chicken is really good. The outer crust is flaky and light the meat is fresh and hot. The mac is cheese is pretty good as well. not the best I've ever tasted, but definitely not the worst. The fried Okra was excellent!   The only negative things I can mention are the the wait times and the portions. I know soul food can take a while but when you've only got a one hour lunch break you can just hear the time ticking away as you wait 30 minutes for your food. In addition, the servings were bigger when they first opened, it seems they've cut back for whatever reason on the sizes...maybe to save money? Who knows. But when one of my coworkers receives half a piece of catfish in her combo....well nothing good can come from that.  All in all it's great to have a soul food restaurant on this side of town with a friendly staff.
4 i will def. be going back!  went here for breakfast and cant wait to try the rest of the menu.  great size portions for a great price.  my breakfast (corn beef hash, eggs, toast, potatoes was YUMMY!) my husband said the waffles were awesome!  my one year old daughter ate all her grits.  friendly service and a very clean restaurant.  cant wait to go back...
4 By no means am I a soul food expert but if the dish is fried, covered in gravy or sauce or all the above then COUNT ME IN.  It was pretty busy when we walked in on a Tuesday night.  They had the soul classics blaring through the speakers while the Lakers were on TV with their new lineup was tanking it against the Mavericks.  So far, so good!  Their menu offered all the soul offerings you would expect like fried chicken, ribs, fried catfish and all the usual suspects for sides.  My wife opted for the smothered chicken ($14) which was fried chicken drenched in gravy.  That was excellent.  The gravy was really good but we would consider ordering fried chicken with a side of gravy so we could enjoy the crisp of the chicken which was nonexistent post smothering.    I opted for the turkey wings ($14) which consisted of 2 big assed baked turkey wings smothered in gravy.  Even though the gravy was the same for both, they tasted quite different based on the preparation of the meat.    You get 3 sides per entree unless you get chicken and waffles.  3 sides is more than enough and all the ones we tried were on point.  That included collard greens in some amazing sauce, delectably sweet sweet potatoes, red rice and beans with great sausage flavor and the mac+cheese.  The cornbread they gave was in pancake form and went terrific with syrup.  No free refills on drinks and they charge $1.50 for water so you might as well get sweet tea, Kool Aid or lemonade for $2.  Breakfast menu also looked damn good.  I'd like to try that out sometime too.
3 Roomie and I were quite excited about the fact that a soul food restaurant opened up within walking distance of the house. We were even more excited about the fact that it delivers. He ordered the chicken and waffles ($9) and I ordered the fried chicken with sides of macaroni and cheese, hush puppies, and corn ($14). The ordered was delivered in 45 minutes. The chicken and waffles were good enough to satisfy the craving. The waffles seemed too similar to an Eggo waffle for me to give much praise too. My order of fried chicken as well as the fried chicken topping the waffle lacked any flavor and was overcooked. The skin and batter was a dark brown color and was slightly bitter. The macaroni and hush puppies were mediocre and the corn was straight out of a can. All in all, not terrible, but for the price, I probably will not eat there again.
5 I've had the chicken and waffles and the cat fish. Both are delicious. Start off with cornbread pancakes! Awesome
4 A little soul goes a long way, and at Soul Food Cafe they have plenty to go around.  This quaint eatery has a great menu and great service.  They cook to order, so everything is piping hot when it gets to the table.  Best of all, they have Kool Aid!  Woohoo!
3 Finally some southern food on this side of town! M&M was my go-to place for soul food but its actually too far from me. This place is a good substitution. Like the other people have said, the meat loaf is the thing to order here. One bite of this and you'll be transported to fluffy meat loaf smothered gravy heaven! (does it exist? YES!) Thing to stay away from were the ribs. I think there were only 3-4 ribs and they were covered in so much sauce it made it difficult to eat. The smothered chicken was quite good also with large pieces of chicken and lots of savory gravy. So why did I give this place 3 stars? Mainly because the portion size did not match the price. This is geared towards the ribs and the meat loaf. Even though they do come with sides, the main reason why I ordered the entree was to get the entree.... and not the sides.... so I expect a larger portion. Other than that, this is a good place for some good southern food.
5 Went to visit Soul Food Cafe recently after Thanksgiving, , The Cook really put that Down Home southern Soul Cooking into my meal and my family we each order something different and each meal was Delicious. From the Chicken&Waffles, to the Ribs,Catfish, and lets not forget the Gumbo!! Yum Yummy if your thirsty Please try the Most popular drink Sugar Daddy  punch this Drink it was sooo good! . To Soul Food Cafe I enjoyed the Food, The Atmosphere inside; To The Chef Mr. K  To all those who are apart of Soul Food --You guys Rank number 1# in my book And the Waitress Ms. Chris your service was awesome.... So to all that haven't tried Soul Food Search No More when you visit Las Vegas make that your stop for Breakfast, Lunch and or Dinner
5 I'm hooked! I visited this spot 3 times last week. I love me some grits n hot links for breakfast. I also ordered biscuits n gravy...omg!!! It was the best I've ever had. For dinner I had smothered porkchops that came with 3 sides. There was so much food that I ate only half and saved the other half for lunch the next day. So so good. The best part about this place (besides the food), is the location. Right by my house. So glad that that there's a soul food restaurant in the SW part of town. Oh, and the staff are the friendliest!
5 HOLY SHIT, MOTHER OF GOD, THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!    First off, I am planning to file a lawsuit against this place -- because they have MADE ME ADDICTED TO SOUL FOOD!!!!!   Second, if you can't hear me, that is because you might be deafened by the sound of how FRIGGING INCREDIBLE THIS PLACE IS.    Ok, maybe a little over the top, but it is well-deserved.    Everyone from my office strolled down here one day, figuring we might as well try a new local business.  The service was on the spot.  Your butt hits the chair and the cornbread gets slapped down in front of you.  You look at it... its a pancake.  You think, "ok, sure, I'll eat this while I wait."  Then, this corn goodness just explodes in your mouth.  Seriously, I could eat just the cornbread.    The first time I ate there, I had the Oxtail.  Then, that's what I had the next three times too, because it was sooooo good.  But, I figured that I should at least explore the menu a bit.  The chicken and waffles just might have to be on my short list if I am ever offered a "last meal."  The breading here is like nothing I have ever tasted before.  The liver and onions?  FORGET EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT LIVER AND ONIONS!  They are a spiritual experience.  Turkey leg!  Howl at the freakin moon and call me sally!  Whatever that means....   I have yet to eat anything here that didn't make me crave it the next day.  I HATE this place, as it has caused me to put 5 lbs on in the past month eating here.  I CANT STOP!    Yeah, its THAT good.    And, the food isn't the only great thing.  The people who work here are so nice, great service.    I guess if I had to say anything is not 100%, maybe the atmosphere?  But, that's only if you are looking for "atmosphere."  It is utilitarian.  Nothing fancy.  Frankly, I am glad for that.  It does not NEED any accoutrements, or padded booths, or anything else.   This is the kind of place that keeps you coming again and again with great food and great service.  I love, love, love this place.  Best thing to happen to the neighborhood!
4 Grabbed some lunch here while waiting for my car to be worked on at the Firestone near by. I had the fried catfish, fried okra, and rice on gravy. It was quite tasty. Fish was cooked nice and crisp. It was great with a little tartar sauce and their home made hotsauce. Loved the fried Okra.... tore that up. The rice and gravy was simple, but very good as well. I wasn't used to having corn bread in a mini pancake form, but it also tasted good. Nothing too special with the corn bread. I've had better corn bread with actual corn in it. Overall, I really liked the place. Friendly waitress, sports on the tv and not loud at all. I will have to try the rest of the menu when I am back in Vegas again.
4 Short version: Came here with my wife and son on a Saturday night, and the place was busy and understaffed. The food was excellent, though, and made up for the hit-or-miss service by the overworked-but-friendly waitress. Perfect if you're hankering for a deep fried, barbecued, or slathered-in-gravy food fix.  Longer version: This unassuming place is nestled around the corner of the Albertsons shopping center at the SE corner of Rainbow and Warm Springs. Football played on both TV screens, and the small seating area was pretty crowded. The staff was friendly and inviting.  We received: Cornbread - Their cornbread is cooked like pancakes and served as complimentary appetizers as well as with most entrees. Crispy, chewy, and buttery. Very nice.  BBQ Ribs with Yams, Fried Okra, and Mac & Cheese - The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, and they were slathered in a thick, sweet sauce. Messy as all hell, until I realized they were so tender I could flake the meat off with a fork and eat it that way. - AMAZING yams, cooked with plenty of brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter. Most dinner entrees include 3 sides, and if I had known the yams were this good I would've ordered the yams as all 3. VERY sweet, so if that's not your thing, they may not be as good for you. - The fried okra was decent, although there were some messy burned up chunks of fries in with the okra. - The mac & cheese is thick and cheesy, although best eaten while it's still hot and the cheese hasn't started to solidify too much.  Fried Catfish with Rice & Gravy, Mac & Cheese, and Hush Puppies - Coated in cornmeal breading, this entree includes 2 giant slabs of catfish. My wife ordered this, and claims it's some of the best fried catfish she's ever had in Vegas. I'm not a huge catfish person, so it seems quite good, but it's not really my thing. - The rice & gravy was good, although we asked for more gravy because it didn't seem like there was enough on it. - Because they were understaffed/overworked, they just kind of forgot about the hush puppies. They brought them later, but it was late enough that we just had them bring them to go.  Kids Meal of Chicken Fingers and Fries - I'm not sure why they list them as chicken fingers, because what came out were chicken wings (which isn't listed on the kids menu). Good fried chicken wings, sure, but not what we were expecting.  Peach Cobbler - We ordered the small serving, and yet it was more than enough for the table, consisting of a large bowl loaded with cobbler. Almost syrupy sweet, which can be both a good and bad thing. It was very tasty, although it might send you into a sugary food coma.  Sugar Momma drink - Their version of an Arnold Palmer, using southern sweet tea instead of regular tea with the lemonade. DELICIOUS. Definitely ordering this again.  Overall, the food was great and we had a positive experience. Hopefully the staffing thing was an aberration, because the food is good enough to warrant a visit.
4 I visited the Soul Food Cafe with my cousin last week. We loved the open kitchen and the friendly staff - we came in around 8:30 and didn't realize they closed at 9, but they still took our four orders (two to go, two dine-in) and let us stay and chat well past closing.   The cornbread is quite unique and the butter made it slightly on the salty side. I ordered the lemonade and was completely unprepared for the sweetness I was to experience from the first sip. Crystal brought me half a glass of water to dilute it and that worked perfectly.   The catfish was heavily deep fried, as to be expected, and it was so yummy. I could've eaten everything as its own entree, and that includes the potato salad, Mac and cheese and yams. I'm so glad we chose against SmashBurger that night. I'll definitely be coming back.
4 Its actually a surprise spot! my bf ordered fried chicken combo (figured is the signature item) .. i didnt want deep fried stuff so i had grilled oxtail combo w corn. The taste is actually pretty good, fried chix is not greasy at all yet has good flavor, oxtail cooked perfectly and come in good portion. There was a pancake like kinda cornbread came w it,  not really sure what that was but it was YUMMY!! will defly will go back again, finally at this restaurant location has something good LOL
4 3.75 stars.  Good soul food restaurant on the SE corner of Rainbow & Warm Springs. Crowded and loud. I had the Hot Links Dinner and was impressed, best links I've had outside of Louisiana and not extremely hot but pleasantly hot. Had the yams (wow they are sweet but good), the mac & cheese (ok) and the corn (ok) + cornbread (little cornbread pancakes with butter, pretty darn good). Washed it down with the sweet tea (which wasn't overpoweringly sweet but decent). Roommate had the liver & onions this time (overcooked & dry) but she had had the fried chicken & fried catfish before and really enjoyed it. Service was efficient and very friendly.  Dining room was fairly loud, two football playoff games were on and the staff & customers were hooting & hollering but not so bad to be annoying. Good restaurant for that change of pace something different to eat.
3 Hit Soul Food Cafe a few months back.  This location previously housed a new pizza place every 6 months or so.  Pleased to see another cuisine is taking a chance at this location.  walk in to order some food to go.  Place is blasting music which might annoy some but was fine with me.  Disappointed to read it will take at least 20 minutes if any fried food is ordered - i was kinda in da mood for fried Chicken ... next time.  I purposely look for menu items that i figure are easily prepared since i have limited time.  I opt for the meatloaf and the smoked sausage lunch plates.  Sadly, it still took over 20 minutes to get my food.  I loved the sausage, the meatloaf ...ehhh.  For the life of me, i can't figure out why it took so long for the food.  there was ony one other customer and the meatloaf is pre-cooked.  The staff were very nice and i sense this place has potential but the food i opted for was average.  I will definitely try again ( call in the fried chicken order ) and i'm hoping this place lasts longer than the prior occupants.
1 Horrid.. Wait time for food was upward of an hour.. When it came out, bland,burnt and just didn't taste good. Also forgot half the order. Better southern food in town.. miss this.
1 Food was bland and overpriced. Slow service too. What do you mean there is no sweet potatoe pie? Come on guys, if you're in the restaurant business you should never be out of something.
4 Finally! a soul food restaurant in my neck of the woods.  I was impressed with the cornbread, catfish, and yams, not so much the chicken though.   It's nice to get some good comfort food when you're surrounded by fast food all over the place... thank you for coming!
5 I was completely blown away from the first bite of cornbread from there I was hooked I had the catfish deep fried ocra and the greens it was awesome great flavor fresh hot and obviously home made with care and great service top it off with home made lemon cake that was the best I ever ate I will go back for sure everyone should try this awesome place
2 Hate to say this, but my food was awful.  Cornbread and gravy was very good but the smothered chicken was awful,  it was tough and dry.  The blackeyed peas tasted like they were straight out of a can, no seasoning, had to keep adding salt and pepper to everything.  Plus they had no greens!!   Soul food place with no greens??   Had cabbage instead; it was horrible, swimming in water, no seasoning.  Potato salad was awful. I will give them a second chance. Hopefully it will better.
3 I tried this place out some time ago, and was pretty satisfied with what i ordered. It was breakfast time and the restaurant was within biking distance away from my girlfriends house. So I get on her bike and head out there for a soul food style breakfast.   I ordered the corned beef hash with potatoes and a side of waffles. I totally enjoyed the breakfast. Corned beef hash must have been cooked with butter or something because it was pretty rich compared to other hashes i've had. their waffles tasted pretty good as well.   Although I finished my whole breakfast, it wasn't a meal that totally stuck in my head. I'm sure they've changed a couple things since then, but i'm in no rush to re-try this place.
5 If you are craving for soul food, this is your place.  Good stuff, big portions and service with a smile.  The fried stuff are not greasy, the fried chicken meat is moist and the ribs are to die for.  Meaty goodness peeled clean off the bone.  The dinner prices are more expensive than lunch, and it comes with 2 large serving sides so it can be shared by 2 people.
4 The best soul food in Las Vegas.  Been here a couple of times. Friendly staff. Fabulous hot water corn bread and beans and rice. Red Snapper is tasty both grilled  and fried. Three sides with your entree is more than generous. We will definitely be going back again!
2 I LOVE to cook! I was raised by a Black Southern grandma, so I can cook soul food.  But, sometimes, it is nice to get a break and let someone else do the work.  I'd recently read a nice review done by Heidi Knapp-Rinella for the RJ and was excited.  I took my family here tonight and it was just an okay experience.  The hotwater cornbread was the best i've had in a long time.  The hushpuppies, greens, waffles, and fries were great, too.  The chicken was nice and crispy, but like in so many places, the meat wasn't seasoned.  (I usually marinate my chicken overnight in a buttermilk brine prior to frying).  Our server, Patrice, was awesome, very friendly and attentive.  What ruined the experience for me?  I was checking out and when I'd informed the person that I didn't want to use my PIN but wanted to process the order as a credit, I was informed that I would have to pay a 3.5% surcharge.  EXCUSE ME?!! pay for using my own card?  And she had the audacity to reply, "well, it's not that much, only a few dollars."  SERIOUSLY? then why are you trying to pass on this cost to your customers?  For this reason alone, I will NEVER come back here.  What a crappy attitude!
4 Enjoyed it greatly! We had the smothered pork chops.  The corn bread was so good... left me wanting more!! Looking forward to a return trip! :)
1 It was really bad, but they could improve.
5 I ordered the smothered chicken with rice and gravy, yams and greens. Had the cornbread cake which was really good. I enjoyed everything about my meal. My husband ordered the fried snapper and was a satisfied customer as well. I recommend this place, but only if you really want some down home cooking!
3 Been here 3 times now and have enjoyed the food each time.  The service could be just a touch more friendly.  The food is consistant however their sweet tea has been different each time.  My frist visit, the tea tasted fermented, kind of like malt liquor.  The 2nd time it was spot on which confirmed to me that they had not properly cleaned their dispenser or brewed fresh tea on the previous visit.  Today, the tea was WAY sweeter than usual.  Something else that disturbs me is that on my last 2 visits, I used the restroom to wash my hands and the sink was bone dry both times.  This was around 1pm.  How is this possible unless nobody is washing their hands?  :(  Perhaps they have an employee only restroom?  Hell if I know but it concerns me so I doubt I will be going back.  What a shame.
4 their chicken and waffles are legit.
2 This is really high priced soul food. Had meatloaf that was just okay, candied yams were sweet as others have mentioned but I have a vicious sweet tooth so they were good to me, the fried chicken was over fried and I had the worst tasting red beans and rice ever (just disgusting). For really good soul food I go to M & M's personally and the prices are better.
3 So it's field Friday and my partner and I decided to roll through here.  Apparently, she has a plug here and got loads of catered delivery ranging from chicken, ribs and other mouth watering comfort favorites.    Of course, I took full advantage of the free Yelp check-in offer, free small side!  I been on that back in the dizzle crave so had to go with the liver and onions, naturally.  Sides included cornbread, fried okra, yams and potato salad.  My partner got the chicken and waffles and house cornbread order.  When asked about drinks, our waitress Latrice, went over the drinks and mentioned a sugar momma and sugar daddy. We was rolling, I asked how old was the former, and likewise my partner regarding the latter...too hilarious!  We stuck with water and lemon after a good chuckle.  The restaurant can be food nestled in the north east corner of the shopping center, next door to the barber shop, no generalizing please.  It can be in the cut, in fact, I think that is what the barber shop is named next door...lol.    The place is simply decorated and well kept with a large view of the kitchen area.  The walls are adorned with some boxing and sporting memorabilia and sure it will build through time.  The staff is warm and friendly and attentive.    The servings are above average and very filling in addition to the various sides that can be ordered.  This place has good comfort food, but there wasn't anything that stood out.  Then again, I have not tried everything yet, so think its fair to rate this place a "3" for the time being and will be updated accordingly as I frequent.  The best thing about the place is the location since there is not much soul food in the lower southwest area.  This provides that needed flavor to satisfy any craving if you are in the mood for good southern food.
3 Yummy food and a friendly staff. I had the BBQ chicken with white meat and it was a huge dish. The BBQ sauce is very unique. I would definitely go back. There are other dishes I am curious about and I would love to try the peach cobbler.
4 Just had the catfish, greens and corn bread. Reminded me of what I would eat as a kid in Harlem. That's some good food. I'll be back.
5 Fall off the bone good.
2 Gave them three chances. First, was at workplace, our potluck we ordered catered service, and flavor and quality was terrible. Second, ate a lunch meal, fried chicken with greens, mac, and bread. Food actually tasted okay, but if I'm paying nearly 20 bucks, i better be full... i was still hungry. The barbers next door won't even fully endorse them, while getting haircut, the conversation was not favorable for Soul Food Cafe. Third (attempted) chance, I was ordering catfish A la carte, uh... Turns out there isn't an a la carte option for anything. I asked for cater menu, because that usually has bulk or a la carte style orders, but cater menu was basically in store menu xeroxed on paper. Awful service, no a la carte on menu, very disorganized.
1 I have been to this place many times and its a hit and miss I always order the chitterlings and sometimes they are amazing and then I get them sometimes and they taste watery like they didn't put one lick of seasoning in the pot. This last time I ordered out and not only did I get watery chitterlings I got hard yams.
1 The worst food ever. the collard greens were bitter.  I ordered BBQ ribs.  I got something that looked more like rib lets sloped in nasty BBQ sauce.. I also got potato salad, it looked more like mash potatoes and tasted awful.. Not to mention they did not put it in a separate container.  I got it hot and my collard green juice was sloped in there to.. oh and then my fried okra was so salty..  but  last but not least the pancake cornbread was really good.
5 Love, love this place! IAM hooked on the chicken and waffles, their corn bread, and the friendly staff. It is so refreshing to finally find a comfort food restaurant that provides value in a great atmosphere.   On another note, IAM a bit of a bathroom snob (LOL, it's a reflection of the facilities value) and this restaurant gets a thumbs up from me ;-D
5 This is the place I've been looking for!  This place hits the mark. The food is EXACTLY like my grandmother's cooking and I feel like I'm at home eating here. Something about great comfort food that entices my serotonin levels naturally.  I can't wait to go back and try the fried fish!  PROS: Macaroni & Cheese              Oxtails              Chitterlings (weekends only)              Candied yams - very sweet              Potato Salad -  excellent              Gravy               Cornbread cornbread cornbread!!!!!  CONS:  So filling I couldn't try dessert               The portion of the chitterlings was small for $11.50*                   *in all fairness, that has been the case everywhere I've ordered chitterlings.   I'll be back.
5 Their yams!! I ordered the snapper with greens and cabbage and it was sooo good. Love love love everything about this place. Food was A+++!
4 The food is FANTASTIC! The corn bread is my favorite. The perfect amount of sweet and salty. The service is good, but not great. Food comes quickly and it's all fresh. I highly recommend this place.
5 Great food,  smothered chicken is the best. I haven't been to a place in a while where everything on the menu is good.  I don't eat soul food often.  But, this place really changes my choices.  It is now on the radar.
4 OMG!!! the BBQ RIBS are Amazing!!! the corn beard is the best I ever had the only thing I wish they had a one rib add on to the lunch special. a PLUS you can watch the Niners games there :)
1 I just called to place an order for delivery and the girl who picked up the phone answered Yes. Thought I dialed the wrong number and I say hello. She says hello w/an attitude like I'm bothering her! I say can I place an order for delivery? She says impolite, you're going to have to hold *crickets* Wth? she comes back w/you know what you want? you know what hold on? and puts me on hold again!!! Hung up and told my husband we will not be calling or coming back! Please have people that can answer the telephone and take orders professionally please #VeryDisappointed
5 Thank you Shila (the owner) for reaching out to me and trying to make things right after my previous review. When I called to place my order, the gal who answered sounded energetic and I was glad as I placed my order for delivery.   My husband came home from an out of town job and we also have family from out of town so I ordered 3 dinners for delivery. I ordered the smoothered chicken, seafood platter and ox tail dinners. The truck that the food was delivered in was a nice advertisement of the restaurant. The food was awesome! We are Samoan and we have big appetites so the portions were very fullfilling.  Thanks again to Shila and everyone at Soul Food Cafe for redeeming our faith in you. We will definately be back!!!
4 I went here with a group of my friends after we had a basketball game and we had a good time chilling here and eating.   The restaurant is small, but not small to the point where they couldn't seat a party of 8. What I liked about the restaurant is that they have two TVs going on, one had the Sunday night football game (in which my Indianapolis Colts were playing, go Colts!) and one where they had 8 Mile playing.   We sat down, got our waters, and ordered. I heard a lot about their cornbread previously and so I definitely wanted to try that. Little did I know that everybody that dines in (for dinner at least) gets cornbread! I was happy and when it was served... Man that was good cornbread! That was rated GAF right there. The orders will come out a little slow, especially if they have to fry your food, so expect a little day for that reason, but it comes our fresh and hot, so you can't really argue with that. I personally ordered the chicken and waffles and the waffle was my favorite part. The waffle has a cinnamon taste to it and it was crispy. The chicken was pretty good, but I personally have a hard time eating the wings, in which I opted for the three wings instead of the breast.   I was a little confused as far as the service went because we never got refills and I didn't know if we should just go and get it ourselves since there was a fountain that we could all access, and so we just got the refills ourselves. My friend's brother got the kids chicken basket and that wasn't that great. It wasn't like the crispy breaded chicken fingers you would expect, it was this long strip of chicken and the outside was a little tough and the inside was kind of dry. For a young kid, or very many people in fact, they may not like that, so possibly opt for something else for kids. The dinner menu is also a bit pricier than the breakfast and lunch menu, but all dinner entrees, besides the chicken and waffles, comes with three sides.  Overall, I had a nice time. I definitely would come back here, maybe not for dinner, but possibly breakfast or lunch, for I found those menus to be more worth its value.
1 Co-worker recommended it, so i stopped by and order chicken n waffle..I'm really disappointed and I'm not coming back here. first to pricey 1pc chicken n 1 lousy waffle for $10.50 to much.. It's OVERPRICED!!!! Then i have to wait for 30 min. For a chicken/waffe..UNBELIEVABLE!!!! Just go to IHOP better pancake n not to pricey!!!
5 The best Soul food hands down! I got the fried chicken wi th rice n gravy cabbage and mac n cheese..... that kill bill
5 We ate here for dinner tonight and it was AWESOME!! The 5 of us had the catfish, BBQ ribs, chicken&waffles, fried chicken, and kid's chicken strips. All of the food was delicious and in good sized portions. The cornbread is amazing!! The service here was excellent; the servers were super attentive and very friendly. We had a great dinner and we will definitely be back!
4 One of the better Las Vegas food delivery experiences I've had (and I lived here for 12 years previously).  We had:  -- bbq chicken; 5 stars -- bbq ribs; 5 stars -- grilled pork chop; 4 stars  sides: corn bread pancake (ok), mac & cheese (ok), string beans (poor), fries (very good), black beans & rice (very good), fried okra (good) and cabbage (ok).  $61 easily fed our group of 4 with leftovers to spare.  This was a winner.
2 The staff is friendly and attentive.  The place is spotless.  The corn pancakes that are served when you are seated are very good.  Most of the food is overcooked and dry.  The waffle with the chicken and waffles was horrible-thin, overcooked, funny taste.  The prices are exhorbitant, especially for a strip mall and the size of the portions.  Went once, won't return.
2 For a soul food place that prides itself on their fried chicken, i was severely dissapointed!  Who serves the breast piece deboned.  The bone provides the juicy juicy and all the flavor.  Instead i got an overcooked dry and inedible breast.  I was starving so i forced myself to eat it by washing it down with lots of hot sauce.  I ordered the chicken dinner with 2 sides, collards and cabbage which were both good.  The cornbread pancake amuse was a nice starter as i waited 15 minutes for the chicken.  I certainly dont mind the wait but dont serve me a well done piece of chicken when i can pay a fraction and get better fried chicken at popeye's or churches.  i wont be back - yes it s possible they missed but you cant miss on fried chicken when that's one of your staples....it should be easy...like a layup for them...come on man!
5 I have been to this restaurant several times, and have always had awesome service and delicious food! The food prices are very reasonable,  and the tasty food keeps us going back.  We recently went for breakfast. ..wow!  Large portions of pancakes and biscuits n gravy!! I absolutely love the corn bread pancakes that come with each meal.  You need to try this delicious food!!!
2 The food here is a real hit it miss, I'm not much of a fan of soul food seeing how it's usually a big hype of generic tasting foods. I went in not with high hopes and to my amazement I was right the food was horrid.   I decided to try the smothered steak with 2 sides(Mac+cheese bland)... This was one of the worst decisions of my life. The steak was in pieces and swimming in gravy making it look like I ordered soup with a side of beef jerky. The texture of the meat seemed nothing near fresh, it tasted as of it were made a week in advanced and consistently frozen and defrosted everyday for preparation on the days menu. I would never slam anyone's cooking like this but it seriously had the consistency of a schools lunch food prepared by microwave. Not palatable to any extent. The only thing that did bring me some enjoyment was the delectable corn bread pancake. I don't think I could bare to give this place another shot.
3 Finally tried this place, the food was good, I really enjoyed the cornbread. The price is a little high in my opinion for soul food. When I look at the whole experience food, atmosphere, quality I can't justify the price.   The service was good, very friendly. If they brought each dinner item down by 4-5 dollars I think they would do double business.
2 This place is way over priced. It would be one thing if it was actually worth the cost, but it just isn't. The food here is very subpar and bland. I've given this place several chances since it's right down the street from me, but this place is just not the business. Honestly, I'd rather eat Popeye's Chicken that's right down the street, and that's a shame! Some of the cashier girls are very cute and I think that's the only reason I went back lol. Well, pretty faces can't mask ugly food forever! Get it together over there Soul Food Cafe!
5 We decided we wanted some Soul food.  Checked out my fellow yelpers, because we didn't want to go to the places we've been before.  So we came across this place.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in, we were asked if it was for here or to go!   We picked up some menus and had a seat, the very nice young lady said she would be right with us.  We well just missed the lunch menu, that's about 1/2 the price of the dinner menu, but Ohhh well!  So I ordered the catfish special that's for us yepers It was a lot of fish!  Then I order the mac n chees.  It also came with some really good cornbread pancake.  My husband wanted Oxtails, but it was going to be a wait!  Think his 2nd choice was the short ribs.....well they were out of that also for the moment!   So he went with the meatloaf, greens, yams and blackeyed peas!   The meatloaf just mealted in my mouth!  I didn't taste anything else on his plate, but it was alot of food, and he brought 1/2 of his food home.  My fish I ordered it extra crunchy, it was really good.  I was very satisfied with my meal.  The food came really fast too!  It wasn't even 5 min.    The young lady that waited on us was really friendly, she also told us the history of how this place got started.  And low and behold, he started this because he worked and another soul food place.  And it's better than the place he use to work at!    My husband can't wait to go back and try the oxtails and the short ribs.  Soooooooooooo, we will be back!
5 My man and I recently moved here from Los Angeles and were in search of a great soul food spot.  Saw this ad in weekly circular and decided to give it a try. It's a little distance from North Las Vegas but worth the drive. I had fried chicken wings, mac n cheese and greens. My man had smothered chicken, red beans & rice and yams. It was so good. We were stuffed. The service was great and the restaurant itself was nice and clean.  The personal photos on the wall give it a down home feel and we can't wait to go back!
5 One of the best Soul Food spots I've tried in Vegas! Been here a couple times.  Food is good and reasonably priced.
3 Have eaten their 4-5 times food is good most of the time but 3 of those times they screwed up the order and the last time the chicken was so overcooked and dry I couldn't finish it. Would be a great place if they put more effort into it. I might go back I might not. Honestly I think if they read this they would not care one way or another that's the vibe I got from them
5 The best fried chicken I have ever had. The service was excellent and everyone was super friendly. Cornbread that is so good it will make you cry. It's not much to look at but the food speaks for itself.
3 Came here for a quick meal since it is right around the corner from my house and my friend was craving some soul food. Honestly I'm not a huge fan of soul food but thought id give it a shot. She had the Chicken and waffles and I had the smothered chicken with corn and red beans and rice. To my surprise I enjoyed it more than I thought I would but considering how expensive it is I would rather spend my $17 elsewhere.  The chicken was cooked pretty good but I was dousing it in the side of hot sauce to give it a little flare. My favorite was the red beans and rice.  The girl that took our order was really friendly and they actually got our food out to us quicker than they had originally told us which was a plus. I would go back again only if I'm with someone else that is craving this type of food... I would never choose this place in my own though.
1 The food was good, but the bad service really ruined the entire experience. If I go back it'll be to pick up my phone order since the establishment shows priority to those doing so.
3 We have picked up to go orders from Soul Food Cafe a few times and tonight was the first time we dined in.  It was pretty busy when we arrived at 5 pm on a Saturday, lots of people coming in and out picking up orders.  We sat down and was waited on by a very cheerful waitress.  Our drinks came out pretty quick, and then we waited...and waited...I noticed a lot of people coming in to pick up orders and they were also waiting for quite a while.  Seems they only have two people cooking in the open air kitchen and three people taking orders/waiting tables. Lots of confusion among the waitresses as there were a lot of people calling and picking up and there was quite a bit of wrong orders going out.  We finally get our cornbread pancake first- warm, large and sweet, they were the size of a small plate and were fluffy and quite good.  Next came our sides and a few minutes later our entrees. The sides were all very tasty, collard greens were not over cooked, potato salad was flavorful with what seems like relish, mac and cheese was good and yams were overly sweet (but the mister liked them).  I had the fried chicken, they were perfectly seasoned and the skin (my favorite part) was crispy. The mister had the smothered chicken and thoroughly enjoyed his meal.  I also ordered a small order of chitterlings for $7 and it was horrendous.  I've had chitterlings once before in another soul food place in San Francisco and it wasn't bad so I wanted to try theirs.  Let me start by saying that I am an adventurous eater, I eat just about everything and anything.  I grew up eating innards (intestines, tripe, heart, kidneys, liver, pork/chicken/duck blood..I even LOVE balut!) so for me intestines is nothing new BUT good god, the chitterlings here were just awful..I took the first bite and nearly gagged.  I put some hot sauce on it and tried again, thinking maybe I just had a bad piece, nope, second bite was just as bad.  Two bites and that was enough for me, they just did not taste clean at all!  If it wasn't for their fried chicken and great sides as a saving grace, this review would probably be pretty bad.  I wanted to try their oxtails too but the table next to us ordered it and the woman sent it back....I know some of the items on their menu is actually pretty good (chicken and fried fish) so I'll be back again and hope to update my review as I really like to support local mom and pop places.  Plus, they have Niner logos everywhere so you know I gotta give them props for that :)
5 My family and I truly enjoyed some "real" soul food. Thanks for bringing the experience to Las Vegas! We had catfish, chicken and waffles...as my kids say, "Ma this food is bomb!"
3 I was super excited to find a soul food place here in Las Vegas, just moving here from Atlanta, and being a huge soul food fan! I did my research on yelp and decided to give Soul Food Cafe a try! We were greeted by a very nice waitress and seated right away on a Sunday, so far so good! I ordered the Catfish lunch, comes with two sides and cornbread (cornbread is sooo yummy, prob the best part of the meal) I really wanted Collard Greens, my fav, but they were out so I ordered Cabbage and yams. My husband ordered Fried Chicken rice and gravy and Cabbage. We tried to order the ribs for our daughter off the kids menu, but they were out of ribs too :( So we ordered baked chicken for her.  After a pretty long wait we were told very apologetically that they were out of Cabbage also. At this point I did want to leave, or wish I would have known about them being out of food so early on a Sunday, I would have liked the option to try again another day...BUT after waiting about 1.5 hrs we stayed, and waitress said that she would comp two sides for us. We finally got our food, honestly the portion size was quite laughable (maybe Ive been spoiled down south?) On the plus, the food was pretty tasty but for the price/portion ratio and the wait I dont know  if I'll be going back?   btw..we ordered the Sugar Momma : Sweet Tea/ Lemonade and the Sugar Daddy : Kool Aid and Lemonade..Really Good, but VERY sweet...drank all my sugar for the month ;) lol
4 very friendly. in town from DC was looking for some soul food. The food was BOMB. Took the bus there. Easy location to find. A must go place to eat id vactioning in vegas.
5 Went again! It was awesome...
4 Like their fried chicken! highly recommend! and they deliver.. Yum! especially if you are pregnant.
5 Loved everything...chicken, the ox tails were very tender, greens were good, Mac and cheese awesome, yams were a little too sweet, okra was good! I'll definitely be back! Prices typical of most soul food places..high but worth it
2 I do not like it at all I ordered the hotlink plate and it wasn't good but the yams was good but that's all I can say not even the french fries!! I don't think I will be back there but I had to try it out the place was very small
3 i tried this a few months ago. food was okay but the banana pudding sucks....
4 I was in Las Vegas, vacationing stopped into Soul Food Cafe Loved the food.. Best cobbler I have tasted in years hats off  to the chefs! Great customer service,friendly family atmosphere. Recommend the fried chicken very well seasoned.. Top it off with a bowl of cobbler  you won't be disappointed.
3 I was in the mood for something new and decided to try this place out.i was a bit shocked at the pricing so I decided to just try a few of the side dishes.i ended up ordering three.fried okra,rice and gravy, and collard greens.that came with the cornbread.which was my favorite part of the meal.it was unique and something I've never tasted before.okra and rice were awesome too!the only reason I'm giving 3 stars was because I had asked the waitress if the greens were salty and she said not not really Just a little bit.when I took my first bite I was  happy then the second and third bites I started tasting and overwhelming amount of salt, to the point where I couldn't eat it anymore.which was kinda Sucky since I had asked if it was salty or not.but in the end the waitress was nice And the rest of the good was really tastey so I will definitely be back to try out some more items!especially since I now know they are from the Bay Area!!!!Go Niners!San Jose Born and raised!
5 Great food at a decent price! !! Drove in to Las Vegas for the week. Came to Cafe for breakfast. Food was great. Family was satisfied.
2 Don't believe the hype! I came to see what all the hype was about. Disappointed over the customer service, and the cleanliness of the place. My feet kept sticking to the floor . The dinner plate was highly over priced. For 17 dollars I'm expecting a bigger portions than Roscoes, but nope. The food is in a typical to-go container, and they don't fill it up. The red snapper was bland as well as the mac & cheese. They're hella stingy with the hot sauce, FYI. I'd definitely suggest the Gritz Cafe over this place any day.
3 The food was good! A little salty for me, but very appetizing. Mac n cheese was dry and bland, and the red been and rice was salty. I loved the cornbread! My grandmother would make pancake style cornbread all the time, delish! The gravy was a lil thick on my turkey wings , but the greens and potatoe salad was good. The customer service was phenomenal! Please cut back on the salt tho! Thanks!
2 This wasnt great at all. Fried chicken was VERY DRY and hard to eat my husband had the catfish and wasnt impressed at all. The greens however were very good but wont be going back for that alone. Ella Ems in North vegas is MUCH better.
5 Excellent everything! Catfish, hushpuppies and cornbread are my top favorites. Dont listen to overly critical reviews. This is a clean and laid back place with simply good food. You can see every move the staff makes from the dining area.
5 Ok... First off this is some of the best soul food I had at a restaurant in a long time...We took a cab to get here it's 60.00 for the cab ride roundtrip and 40.00 for the meal, and it was worth it.If you don't like this food, you aren't hood, plain and simple, If your grandma made it, it's here, and they do it right.I ordered the red snapper, red beans and rice, Mac and cheese, and greens..Off the chain all around the board..And they got Kool Aide y'all..I'm saying.  If you know you know, If you don't then, you missing out...Good food, great price.Full as a tick... 5 stars..easy
5 I'm in the service industry. .. it's hard to find good food, customer service and a clean place.   We found all these things.   Food I had was cat fish green yams and corn bread and don't forget sweet tea. Was great mac needed some work but I could tell this was because closing.  They were out of banana pudding so didn't get to try it. Would definitely recommend and eat here again.  Almost forgot we took cab so had to be worth it.
5 Some of the best soul food that I've had in awhile. Fried catfish was cooked to perfection.  Black-eyed peas and cornbread is awesome.  Good service and clean restaurant.
2 Extremely disappointed in this restaurant.  Took my family  there to have a good meal, me and my daughter wanted ribs, but we were told they weer running out. I told her to get them and I ordered the catfish. The fish was so over cooked that it sounded like I was biting into potatoe chips. She said her ribs were OK, but I didn't try them since there were only 3 on her plate. My wife ordered the smothered steak, I gotta say the gravy was great, I loved it, but the steak was over cooked and instead of cooking it in the gravy they pied ur over the top. My fries cane out so burnt that I thought they gave me sweet potatoe ferries instead. I told her I wanted regular fries and she told me they weren't sweet potatoes and she would have then make me fresh ones. Who the hell would bring out fries that represent your establishment like that?       The waitress was nice and friendly and very helpful, she was actually the best part of the experience. It also disappointed me that our sides came out to us about 10 minutes before or meals did, and that I paid $18.50 for 3 pieces of fish and some small sides. It is way overpriced. I paid $8.50 for my son's sandwich that should of been a $2.99 item off of the kids menu. I wish I could say I'd go back but I'd be lying.
5 Went for Mothers Day brunch. My mom substituted the breakfast salmon croquettes for fried cat fish. The dish was a classic tasty cornmeal fry and well seasoned. My grandmother had the chicken and waffles! The thin crispy waffles were as big as the plate and sprinkled with powdered sugar. The chicken wings weren't crazy good but they were well done.  The oil wasn't running off them or anything.  They have some crazy good hot sauce there - Fred's Red Hot! I'd definitely go back :)
1 I walked in alone on a Saturday night about 8:40, they were busy so I was ok with not being greeted immediately. I then noticed that one of the cooks  was looking at me giving me a SERIOUSLY Dirty look. I'm thinking what did I do. I approached the counter area and picked up a menu and a girl comes up to me and says "we stop seating at 8:30". So this is my "welcome" to the place. So much for Southern Hospitality. I mention to her the hours posted say 9:00. "So you really close at 8:30, not 9" I asked. She was "kind" enough to offer me a dark meat chicken order that had been made by mistake. I'm thinking really!!! I simply told her that I don't like dark meat, turned around and left.  I don't care how good the food might be. When I have a craving for fried cjicken I will go to KFC before I ever give this place a penny. Business must be good if they can turn away customers in such a nasty, inhospitable way.
1 They took forever to bring a waffle which should have came with the chicken the so called cooks were so busy bullshittin my waffle wasn't made until I went up to the counter and asked about it. One server worked and the other girl was completely use less. They have no since of urgency when it came to food prep they were to busy looking at this lady on her motorcycle that they clearly wouldn't have a chance with do your job please and thank you shit. Crazy part it wasnt busy.
4 After coming back at the owners request, I was pleasantly surprised at the food. I got the chicken and waffles which were delicious. The waffles were sweet and the chicken was full of flavor. The cornbread pancake is always good. All in all this place seems to have started to care again. It shows in the food. Thanks Shila. Great customer service.
5 I've tried many soul food restaurant in Vegas and Soul Food Cafe is definitely my favorite!  I've taken my whole family there (party of 10) and everyone loved it! The staff is very friendly and the prices are very reasonable.  I could eat here everyday!! And on those days I don't want to dine-in I order for delivery and they are very fast!
4 Great Chicken and waffles and some really good lemonade. The chicken batter is great but the service has something to be desired. Nice people just a little slow on the service side. But overall a good home style restaurant.
4 Nothing compares to Roscoe's chicken and waffles in Cali but I'm so glad I tried this place out! Who knew chicken and waffles would go so good together?   It is conveniently located in the South West area. Their prices are decent for their serving size. Of course I had to get the chicken and waffles. Every meal comes with corn bread. And when I was thinking they would be small, they're actually pretty big, warm, and delicious! Unlike what you would expect. Their waffles are thin and good sized. But doesn't compare to Roscoe's crispy nature. Their wings are good as well if you don't mind getting down and dirty. What makes the taste even better is the hot sauce that they provide. I got the Mac and cheese as a side and it is very cheesy and smooth. Service is good, nothing to complain about. They're really nice and always greet you when you come in. Usually if it's not busy they let you sit yourself. I always catch myself tipping them nicely.  I'm glad I tried it out because now I don't have to drive 4 hours to get some chicken and waffles. They have a bunch of other selections that I haven't tried yet. But it truly is yummy comfort food that captures your soul.
5 This place is amazing! Everything we had was delicious! Christine gave us excellent customer service. We wish we could take her back to LA with us.
5 Let me start with the service. Out waitress is a bite of sunshine! She's polite, informed , attentive, and sweet as the sugar momma (lemonade and ice tea)! Christine is a jewel and made my experience here the best I've had in Vegas ever! She definitely makes your experience a down home happy experience! Now for the food I ordered the red beans and rice ( amazing)! The corn bread pancake and the hush puppies! All of it was great! The food was fresh, hot, and amazing. I'd definitely make another trip from los Angeles to Las Vegas just for this place. My friends had the meatloaf fried chicken and hot links with Mac and cheese green beans gravy and yams . All of which they rated 5 stars . I recommend this place and wish it all the success to come!
4 I was in Las Vegas with friends when we hit the Soul Food Cafe after partying at the Marquee pool during the day.  I have to say that everything we had was excellent! From the hot links, fried chicken and meatloaf to all the sides. The service was great as well! Christine was so nice, cheerful and helpful. Not to mention the cornbread pancakes they serve, delicious!! The hot links were cooked to perfection and actually hot and spicy! I highly recommend the Soul Food Cafe if you are looking for great food at reasonable prices and friendly service! I'm not giving 5 stars only because the lemonade/iced tea drink was REALLY too sweet. Really a great experience!
5 The best soul food restaurant in vegas. The chicken takes pretty long but it says so on the menu. So with the wait because it's super crispy and not too much breading. The chicken and waffles are like roscos! Yumm! I'm drooling thinking about it.
3 My wife and I tried soul food cafe for the first time today...cornbread is sooo good ... Smothered pork chops and oxtail are both very good although I wish the pork chop was a little bit more tender ... I'm glad we don't have to go all the way to the other side  of town for soul food.
1 This place is a joke. And I ain't laughing. Came here with the family. Sat down another family party of six sat down after us. Got there order first and corn bread. Water. And table set ups while I watched her give out to go orders. Then I got fed up watching this nonsense  and told her I'm ready to order. Took way too long horrible customer service. what can I expect from a place like this.
5 I went to Soul Food Restaurant for the first time for dinner tonight with my family.The waitress Christine was exceptionally helpful in helping us decide what we wanted for dinner. We are from California visiting our son, and grandson, and have never been treated with such professionalism in putting the rights foods together. This will be our new place to dine whenever we come to Vegas with the hope that Christine is there to serve us. Our dinner choice was ox tails, cat fish, spare ribs and chicken salad .. Absolutely amazing
4 We are so happy we've found this place!  A really good soul food place not too far from our house!  We indulged in the fried chicken, meatloaf,  mac-n-cheese, red beans and rice, corn bread, and potato salad.  Wow...just wow!  Everything was delicious and brought back fond memories of good ole' southern cooking, since we're originally from the south.  Miss LaShonda took our order and was very helpful explaining all of the plentiful meal options to choose from to complete our dinner selection. The restaurant was very clean and smelled delightful. The only thing we noticed were the prices to be a little high but you are getting some freshly prepared and delicious soul food! The peach cobbler was added for dessert and we could barely stop ourselves from eating it entirely at one sitting!  We highly recommend this restaurant and look forward to visiting them again!
