3 First of all, the dining room is hideous.  No restaurant should have carpet on the floor, it is just disgusting.  The color scheme is awful, but I guess that is what you can expect from a hotel restaurant.   I have heard good things about the pretzel-crusted walleye, and although it is a very expensive dish, I gave it a try. When the salad came I was very afraid that I had wasted my money because it was the boring, traditional iceberg lettuce salad.  I think it came from a bag.  The lettuce was brown and old-tasting and the veggies were boring and tasteless. When the entree came I was pleasantly surprised.  The pretzel crust was crunchy and not as salty as I had feared.  The walleye was delicious and moist and beautifully cooked. The rice side was a little bland, but not terribly so and the veggie side was steamed and lovely. I wish the walleye was served at a more appealing restaurant.
5 Cobb salad was awesome.  Kelly was a sweetheart! Would come back for sure.
5 Bar tender was great. Very friendly. Food was great!!!
4 Agree with the other reviewers.  Very "hotel restaurant" interior, but don't let that turn you off because the food is super yum!  I got the shrimp po' boy and holy moly it was big and packed such a punch of flavor.  Shrimp crispy, spicy remoulade extra zingy and hoagie crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Love!   I'm also a huge fan that the fries are beer battered which spiced up your normal fries on the side thang.    They have a great Yelp check in offer.  Buy one beer get the other free.  Score!
3 I stopped in here for dinner since I was staying at the Radisson which is where this is located. Service was excellent with the bartender being very friendly. Used my yelp check-in offer for a beverage. I agree with the other reviewer that mentioned the use of carpet. It just made the otherwise well-kept restaurant look dingy.  I ordered the cobb salad even though the ingredients were not typical: kalamata olives, shaved carrots, and guacamole instead of avacado. Before I go further, the bread that comes out with the meal - according to the waiter - is from an Amish bakery and to die for. Kind of a sweet sourdough roll. Yummm.  The salad does come together in a strange sort of way but I could think of ways to improve it. Fortunately, the guac was handmade and not from a tube (which is what I feared) I still would have preferred fresh avacados. Secondly, the lettuce needs more green, so an upgrade from iceberg would be nice: romaine or a mix maybe. Also, beets would be ideal or at least offered as an option.
3 I had the Wisconsin cheese steak and beer battered fries--it was really good!  I loved the onion bun. Atmosphere is typical hotel bar restaurant, but ok. Staff is very friendly and service was prompt.  I'd come back again if I stay in the hotel, but wouldn't seek it out.
4 I visited and saw signs advertising the Friday night fish fry and it looked great. It did not disappoint! I highly recommend it!
5 Try the soup. Service was quick. Food was great. Don't let this "hotel restaurant" fool you. Give it a try
