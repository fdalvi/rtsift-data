3 Fair play to Oddbins, this is a great location for an off licence specialising in whisky. The selection of our nation's most famous export is interesting, varied and comprehensive. Everything is displayed in an enticing and attractive way and there are little notes next to some bottles to inform you of what delights lie before you. The staff here know their stuff and can advise you without appearing patronising or condescending. And, Oddbins being Oddbins ,there are always a few wee bargains floating around the place if you browse hard enough.
4 Since places like Victoria Wine and Threshers went under in the current credit crunch, there really arent that many places that arent super markets to get your wines, spirits and other alcoholic beverages. The trouble with that is, Tesco cater for the masses, but if you want something a bit more specialised, your choice is limited.  As such, Oddbins is now a personal favourate of mine. No only does it replkace Tesco it also does well at being the best off licence I can think of.  The shop itslef may be larger than you were expecting, and its also cheaper too - although admittedly not as cheap as a supermarket. Staff know thier stuff - and there is a huge selection of just about everything, so you'll find something you want to try, I'm sure.
4 Whether it's a bottle of South African plonk you need for a poncey dinner party, or a half bottle of Scotch that's required for an afternoon sitting on a park bench soiling yourself, Oddbins is a pretty safe bet. Since the collapse of our economy most of the other off-license chains have went up the shitter, so for some more obscure social lubricants, it may be your only bet.  Due to it's location in tourist town this branch of Oddbins particularly specialises in whiskey, from standard Whyte and Mackay to 25 year old malts.
