2 The fiesta potatoes are NEVER cooked all the way through.  One worker will literally hand us our bag through the window and just shut the door. Half the time we have to check to see if all of our food is in there or if we're waiting for another bag. No communication what-so-ever. No "here you go!" or "thanks, have a good day!" Just bag, and shut door. Unfortunately she works there a lot so it happens often..
2 Well, Taco Bell is Taco Bell. The service here sucks. You have to remember to ask for hot sauce up front. If you don't you won't get any. If you ask after they give you your bag they get all mad. It's like you asked them to walk 5 miles to get some.
1 I didn't get my debit card back, the cashier ether stole it or handed it out to another customer.  When the manger came out she refused to look for it, apparently at her size checking the floor under the work station was more difficult than she wanted to deal with.  She stated the only thing they can do, is call the police and have the employee searched, but when I said ok lets do that, she back tracked and refused.  I have cancelled the card of course, but it is just a pain in the butt to deal with, plus the cashier an the manager were so rude and disrespectful about it. I remember when customers were supposed to be treated with respect.  DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE WITH YOUR CARD!!
