2 The bank is nice but SLOW ! Every time I come here .. Even if there is only 1 person here... They move slow as hell !!
3 I've been coming to NSB for years now. Very nice people work as tellers, at this location. Nevada State Bank itself, I'm starting not to care for. Unnesicary charges and fee's started in early 2012, without warning. Other than that small ordeal, my overall experience w/NSB has been pretty nice. Hense me banking w/them now for 4+ years and counting...
3 In this age of hurry up and go banking, I still really like the interaction with a person that's handling my business. I enjoy my experience when I go inside.. The tellers are always friendly and remember my name.. Not a big thing but its nice..
3 I wanted to patronize this bank about year ago when I moved her. The people who bank here seem to enjoy the experience. I now have a relationship here and I will experience what the service is like.  My 1st impression is this is a credit union stretching to conduct itself as a bank. Interesting? !? The only advice I would share with the bank is customer service. Everyone is running as lean as possible. But what makes a company stronger is good customer service.   When someone comes in on a Saturday and has an interaction with someone other than the tellers. Employees should acknowledge and offer assistance. You can't just focus on the one in front of you. You have to welcome all who come to you. Remember they come out of choice not obligation.   The lady who served me was polite just needs basic customer service training.  I won't have the constant interaction with this bank but I would like to see them grow and create a stronger institutional financial center here in Nevada.
