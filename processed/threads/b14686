4 They offer both tanning and massages. I don't tan but my wife really likes massages and keeping her happy is good!! Once you are an established client, they have good discounts and a monthly membership that can help with cost if you become a frequent customer.  We will be back.
2 I have seen this place for a long time but was always hesitant to visit. I have always been happy with Massage Envy. I called to check on the hours and they were very motivated to get me in. They accomodated my schedule and got me in same day. The massage was good, but the establishment is a little run down and not too nice. I may go back because of proximatey and price.
4 Amy was great, prices are very reasonable. Office isn't luxurious but does that really matter since you're not there to enjoy a waiting room/lobby? I'll definitely return.
