3 For the most part good service.  I've never had to worry about getting ripped off and the actual work is good.  The only negative experience is once when I dropped my car off first thing in the morning and was told they would take a look at it by lunchtime.  I called multiple times during the day and was assured they would look at it, but when I went to pick it up at closing time, it was in the exact same parking spot as where I left it- they left it there all day and never looked at it!
5 We have been going to Fletcher's for years now. They have always had fast service and fair prices.
5 Super impressed with this location. Had another auto shop tell me I needed brakes and other stuff done. I got a groupon for here and went to have the work done. They were honest and told me I didn't actually need most of the stuff I asked for. Hands down the most honest place I have found in the industry.
2 It would probably be helpful to remember that if you set expectations it is better to under promise and over deliver.  Also, if you have too much business, raise your prices.  People will pay a little more for better service.
