5 After bein 86 off the propertys I was really upset because I really didnt do anything wrong. Besides the fact though I always I mean always find good deals at this store I kid you not that they are awesome with the deals. plus Brian the manager is no longer there so really nice people
1 They should change the name of this place to EZ Rip-Off  I bought 3 Blue Ray movies for $20 bucks, seemed like a good deal. It took them 15 min to ring me up.   Brought them home and 2 of them dont work!  Don't waste your time on this place or you'll be sorry! I warned you.  EZ Pawn I'll never return.
