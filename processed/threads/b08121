5 Faith Works Automotive does good business.  I have a 2004 Toyota Matrix with 152k miles.  I called at 2:30 pm, made it into the place by 3 pm, had them inspect all my brakes, was told that I only needed to replace the back ones, and that even though my tires were cracking that I could still get another 1-2k miles out of them.  The cracks were more due to the kind of rubber composite the tires were made of.  And I had an oil change and was out the door by 4:30 pm.  Fast, honest, and fair.  I think I've found my new mechanic.
5 How do they not have more reviews on Yelp????? I've seen other reviews on google I think.....  The most honest auto repair company, my husband and I helped a friend with her car and my husband knows cars. He wanted to call and make sure Paul was being fair with our friend since she doesn't know cars, and my husband was SHOCKED at how awesome and honest they are!! A man of his word, fair, kind, and they fixed get cat for a great price. Amazing.  We have since started bringing our car to Paul and never had any problems. I tell EVERYONE I know about faithworks :)
5 Looking for a trustworthy car repair shop is stressful, nerve wracking and scary. You worry about the cost, being taken advantage of, missing work because your car will be out of commission, etc etc.   So, let me just make it really easy for you, this is THE best place in the valley to get your vehicle serviced.  Paul, the owner is a car genius! He will make sure that whatever is going on is figured out and fixed up right away. I appreciate the fact that he never tries to sell you something you don't need or adds unneeded repair to your bill. He is up front and honest about the situation. He has been trusted with two of my cars and I have always been grateful for the work he's done.  The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable and above all else, kind and considerate. Highly recommend!
