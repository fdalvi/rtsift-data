2 Ok, so it's a Jack in the Box - I'm not exactly expecting Alton Brown to be flipping burgers.  However, this specific Jack in the Box seems to constantly be running in slow motion.  Since they are open 24/7, it's a great late night drive through spot, and most of my experience is with the drive through.  I don't think that I have ever waited for less than 10-15 minutes from ordering to getting my food.  Even if there are cars in front of me in line, I still end up sitting at the window for at least 5 minutes.  It's like the staff there runs in slow motion.  Of course, when you do get it, the food is hot, which is one of the reasons I keep going back.  I would rather wait for hot food than have it cold and soggy.  Even going inside is like entering a time warp.  The last time I went inside, I waited for 15 minutes before my order was taken.  There was one other customer inside the restaurant.  I then waited for another 10 for my value meal.  At once point a server did offer me a free shake for the wait, but by that time I was almost done eating, and really didn't have another 15 minutes to spare for them to make the shake.  As far as Jack in the Box's go, this one is pretty sad, but they are saved by being about the only 24/7 drive through in this area.
1 Door clearly says drive-thru open 24 hours and lobby till midnight. Drove up at 10:30 and was told the lobby was closed...lame...
