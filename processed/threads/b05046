4 When they have deals there not too bad, they send you a lot of coupons for formula and one of the only places that has a large variety.. I've tried kohls, Burlington, target ect. But all there selections were very small. Macy's isn't bad either and they also sell motherhood stuff...
4 The clerk was extremely helpful and, because she was preggers too, truly did understand my needs. She was very personable and knowledgeable.
4 I really like the new store, they redid it and it's much nicer. Not a very big selection of plus sized maternity, which is hard when you're inbetween their sizes. The clerk was very friendly and helpful which made a difference. I shop with them online quite a bit and they do seem to have good sales.
