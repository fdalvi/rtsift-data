4 Joyful House is a great choice for authentic Chinese food minutes from the Strip.  If you don't want authentic Chinese and prefer some Americanized dishes, they do an excellent job with those too.  Try the beef tenderloin & portobello mushrooms in black pepper sauce, XO green beans, and the chicken cream corn soup.
4 I love the salt fish fried rice here. This is the best place in town for it. The chow fun was really good too. But what brought me back here was the amazing wine list. Are you kidding me? Petrus? Lafite? What?  You wouldn't expect it from this typically family-oriented chinese restaurant but they have an impressive wine list where you can spend thousands on a bottle of wine if you wanted to.  Considering their late night hours, I'm not surprised they offer these bottles. I'd imagine some high rollers come in here for a late dinner after some serious gambling.
4 My coworker swears by this place for their authentic cantonese cuisine.  We went there after work one night for some late night grub.  It's a very nice restaurant in chinatown complete with live fish, prawns, lobster, and crabs.  We went for takeout so we couldn't really judge the service but the guy that seats you was really nice and helpful.  My coworker recommended the salt and pepper pork chops.  Since I had always been told by my ever-so-seasoned fellow yelper/coworker reggie to always order salt and pepper anything whenever I can, I agreed to try said pork chops.  After about a 15 minute wait, the waiter brought out our food.  It smelled great and I couldn't wait to get home to try it.  I opened up the to-go box and there were small breaded pork chops (some with bone, some without) that had bits of garlic and jalepeno all throughout the dish.  It came with rice as well.  When I dug in I couldn't believe how tender they were.  These pork chops just melted away in my mouth.  The contrast of the jalepeno against the pork was incredible with just the right amount of heat and saltiness.  All in all it was a great dish and I would definitely go back.  They had a lobster sale while we were there...19.95/lb down from 29.95/lb and these things were monsters!  Anyways, check this place out...it's great for late night eats.
5 Excellent place and open late to boot!  If I am here with 4 or more, we usually just go with one of the dinner sets on the 1st page of the menu.  Great value and you get A TON of food.  Something is seriously wrong if you ain't totally full after that.  I am a sucker for fresh squid so that is one dish I always order if it isn't a group outing.  I've been happy with everything I've ordered there.
2 I guess you wouldn't expect great chinese food in Vegas but there's got to be something better. Some dishes were good but when it comes to more upscale dishes, this place fails miserably. There's not much authenticity to there dishes. I also sense a little bit of shadyness when someone orders Peking Duck and they keep the duck after slicing off the skin.
3 Maybe I'm used to New York style Chinese food???  But this place seemed a little bland.  I guess I like my chicken and broccoli (American broccoli) with sugar, ginger, soy, and corn starch.  We visited this place around midnight and were the only customers.  The service was good and the atmosphere was modest to humble.  There were live fish tanks in the back.  With so many Chinese restaurants on Spring Mountain, I doubt we'll revisit.
4 I almost didn't eat here after reading previous reviews, but I'm glad I did.    We ordered:   Veggie Egg Foo Young Veggie Crispy Fried Noodles Fried Tofu Fried Rice Roasted Duck Walnut Shrimp  We loved all the dishes.  No complaints from anyone.  I had fun with the Passion Fruit juice with green jelly.
2 I went here after a suggestion from one of the local Chinese bakery workers.  I don't know if it was what we ordered but I didn't care for the food.  I ordered Kung Pao Chicken and my friend ordered Cashew Chicken.  The Cashew Chicken was tasteless with a bland sauce, Kung Pao had flavor in the sauce with a bit of a kick but not a memorable experience.    The pork fried rice was decent for lunch special but not amazing in any sense of the word.  One plus of the take out of this place is that they will give you the soup to go.  The soup was very tasty it was a corn based egg drop soup.  I don't know why a native speaker would send me here but I probably wouldn't go back too quickly.
3 I have mixed emotions about this place.  It's open late, which is awesome.  Food is decent, but nothing fantastic.  Service has always been sub-par.  But somehow I keep going back... hmmm...
4 Good chinese food in vegas?  Yup, I was pleasantly suprised.  The food here is standard chinese restaurant food, good but not excellent.  It is better than what I like to call "Chinese Themed" restaurants that you'll find in the casinos.  Trust me, it's better than the strip stuff.
4 I saw this restaurant on the food network as a good late night eat.  I'm so glad we tried it.  It was really good and I'm so glad that it was open late.  I'll most definitely return.  If you want Chinese food I would eat here, not on the strip.
5 It's the most authentic Cantonese style dishes you can get. Most of the dishes are tasty. If your craving your Chinese wedding banquet food you can get that here. Ummm.....jelly fish cold plate...anybody?  We order about 5 dishes for dinner and they were all delicious. It's a bit pricey but well worth it. Have to come back to try their lobster and many other dishes. The place is neat and clean. Staff is friendly and helpful. Definitely worth coming back!
4 I have not found a good, authentic Chinese restaurant, but when I tried this place with some family members...how should I say this...I saw a clearing (after a search for decent Chinese food) hehehe...  We ordered their Hong Kong Style Chow Mein, Tofu & Eggplant w/ Shrimp Sauce, a Chilean Sea Bass dish, and my fave....their Crispy House Chicken! I was actually impressed with their quality of food. Service was pretty good, but they took a while to give us our tab after it got busy (I guess that's good that they don't rush you!).   I will be eating here more often now that this place has been discovered....(maybe I should just venture down Spring Mountain more often!)
5 Joyful House is a fun family restaurant for all type of guests. They were just recently were elected for Las Vegas City's best Chinese restaurant. Our party was very pleased with the recent remodeling to a modern-contemporary theme, it was total comfort illustrating a mid to upscale authentic Chinese restaurant. One thing that caught our immediate attention was the exquisite display of the live seafood tank.  The staff was very friendly, very courteous, the service was outstanding. The manager recommended their signature "Braised Lobster in Thai Sauce", and our appetite was insatiable for more.  One important aspect of Joyful House that wasn't publicized was their extensive wine list. The 89 bottle of Chateau Lafite was more than extraordinary.  Eventually, we ended our experience at Joyful House with the "Mango Pudding" dessert, complimentary at the request of the owner. Vibrant yellow in a shape of a heart, it was one of the best dessert I've ever tasted. Along with the mango pudding, we also learned an interesting history about the establishment of Joyful House.  Having the opportunity to dine over most of Asia, concluding Joyful House as a "great" Chinese Cuisine falls discriminately short of injustice. And anyone assert dis-satisfactory has zero aptitude in distinguishing a fine authentic Chinese Cuisine. Thank you Joyful House for such an exclusive experience!
4 Good food. Always stop by whenever we are in town. The fact that they're open late is a plus. Price is decent. Then, why not 5 stars, it is the service that they are lack off.  The servers r super lazy. :(
5 This place is definitely my favorite Chinese Restaurant in Las Vegas. Hands down. Every time I have friends in town and they want to eat good off the strip Chinese food, this is place we go. Its open around lunch time and closes super late, 11am-3am. When I first walked into this place, I saw a good sign. Tons and tons of other Asian families eating here. The menu is pretty extensive and also has pictures for the newbies.  We ordered: Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, Pan Fried Sea Bass, Roast Duck, Salt and Pepper Sea Bass, Spicy String Beans with Chicken, Garlic Ong Choy, and some Oyster Clay Pot.  Wow. I was definitely amazed by the taste and quality of the food. The Salt and Pepper Pork Chops are definitely different from the other restaurants. Instead of battering the pork and deep frying it, they do it in a way that the batter isn't fried in. Its like a separate layer above the meat so you can taste both parts when you bite into it. Its weird to explain but its good. So good, that we order it every time we go there.   The Pan Fried Sea Bass is my absolute favorite. The lightly fried sea bass comes swimming in sweet soy sauce but it doesn't overpower the taste nor the light crisp. Definitely a must order.  The Roast Duck here is waaaaaay better than at Sam Woo BBQ. The dish here actually has large chunks of meat. It has a right combination of crispy skin and meaty meat. That's the way this dish should be served.  The Salt and Pepper Sea Bass was good but not a must have. The Spicy String Beans with Pork was good also.... But not a must have. I would probably order other dishes the next time I'm here.  The Oyster Clay Pot was surprisingly filled with..... Lots of oysters! It comes with roast port, fried tofu, and lots of oysters. Definitely a must have if you like this kind of dish.  Last but not least, the Garlic Ong Choy is one of my favorite veggie dishes. It was cooked perfectly. The leafy part was soft, yet not overcooked, and the stems were slightly crunchy in texture.  This place is great. I highly recommended it. Funny thing is when I ask my coworkers where they go to get good Chinese food, they always say Joyful House. I felt like I was the last one in on this wonderful secret. I've been back here at least 5 times since I first discovered it. Its that good.  As always, pictures are included! Yummy!
4 LOVE their Rosy Duck. TIP: appetizer portion if 8.99, half duck is 9.99...it is much larger and worth the $1. We get the duck everytime we go.  Lunch menu is decent. For 6.99 or so you get a drink, eggroll, soup, wonton, entree, and fried rice. The entree I had (beef and green pepper) wasn't exciting or that great, but I felt it was a good value.   House crispy chicken is also amazing.. I will say the house chicken and rosy duck are v. similar, so only order one or the other depending on your particular poultry craving that day.
4 In my world, there's 2 kinds of food. You have Grub and Chow. Chow is the kinda food you eat just to get full (i.e. taco bell, jack'n the box) and grub is something that's of a higher caliber. This place is MOST DEFINITELY some grubbin ass grub.  I would suggest the following: Salt & pepper pork chops Rosey duck Salt & pepper calamari Pan fried baby bak choy Pan fried chinese broccoli
4 A great place for late night dining.  Have never been there before midnight, but i am sure that it is good around the clock.
4 The Joyful House is one of the few China Town restaurants that I never got around to trying when I lived in Vegas but... on my last trip here, I met some friends there...  It's good.  And nice inside... and they accommodated our group really well with little complaint.  I'd say 4 star overall except.. for the dish I ordered.  Lucky me, we were eating family style.  I ordered the seabass mushroom claypot which sounded amazing and was the most expensive thing we ordered... but it was toooo fishy tasting.  Everything was great except for my dish.  *cry*  I'd still go back... I don't hold a grudge.  See ya there.
1 So from the reviews I went to this sorry establishment.  I actually created an account just to write about this nasty place. Beware: They are hidden under the guise of a chinese restaurant.  So I took my boyfriend and his friend, both white yet have a pallette for good chinese food.  The first sign this place might be a problem: No chinese patrons! ALL white people and I mean all white except for me and the staff.  I have to admit we went there twice just to confirm our initial opinion.  Food is not fresh, they lie when they say the fish dish is 50% off. Really??!! $19 for a fried fish.  Do you mean to tell me that the fish was originally $38.  No respectable chinese person would ever pay $38 for a fried fish, even 19 bucks for this low grade, rotten tasting fish. Yuck!  It tasted like it had been sitting in sewer water.    I also had chow fun, garlic spinach, minced pork with salty fish, roast duck and won ton soup.  The only good dish was the won ton soup. How pathetic!  I could tell the food is not fresh.  I agree with a previous reviewer when he was wondering where all the duck meat was on the supposed duck.. All I got was greasy skin and bones.  My journey for great, off the strip chinese food continues.
5 Wow!  Love this restaurant.  We had a big family dinner on Chinese New Year's Eve.  We ordered:  - a CNY special dish - smoked oysters with mushrooms and lettuce - fantastic!  - steamed flounder with ginger and garlic sauce - WOW!!  - salt and pepper shelled shrimps - so yummy!  - cold dish appetizer - 3 kinds of meat and jellyfish - 2 thumbs up!  The duck is so tender and succulent.    - fish maw soup with crab meat - just the right size for our table  At the end of the meal, we had sweet lentil soup for dessert and what's more, it was on the house!!  Will definitely visit this restaurant again.
5 "The MSG is strong in this one" , that's what I expected my fortune cookie to read after tanking 5 glasses of water and 5 cups of hot tea.  But none the less the food was fantastic. Here's what we ordered for a party of 3.  Scallop Soup Honey Walnut Shrimp (HUGE PRAWNS) 2 lb Garlic Crab Pan Fried Sea Bass with Soy Sauce  Sizzling Beef platter Black Bean Clams Roast Duck Chicken Chow Fun.   God. Please forgive me for I have sinned. I am a gluttonous whore and I deserve to have an apple stuffed in my mouth and be roasted over an open flame.
2 Based on the reviews I read, I decided to get food for my family from this place. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed with their food. On top of that, their food was pretty pricey, which included $9 for just chicken fried rice.   I also ordered clams with vermicelli in special sauce as well as walnut pr0nz. The pr0nz were the most expensive, which was $14 bucks. As good as they were, they only put in roughly 7 or so pr0nz in the to-go box. I don't get it. I was expecting more than that. The clams and vermicelli was way too salty, and there were hardly any vermicelli noodles in it. I appreciate there being a good amount of clams, but unfortunately the sauce was more like a soup. The fried rice didn't have much flavor and it was too salty for my tastes as well.   Service was cool though. All the staff were very helpful in making sure I was being helped. Sadly, I wasn't too fond of the food. I'd like to give this place another chance when I'm in town again, but for now 2 stars.
4 A Chinese hot pot place?!  Richard C. proclaimed that Joyful House offered such a treat after 10 pm!  Last Friday night, the Husband and I ventured over to Spring Mountain to find out if such a thing really did exist.  We were only expecting Chinese hot pot, not AYCE for the mere price of $15.50/pp.  We were easily persuaded and a quick peek at what they offered helped as well.  As they set up the gas stove and dual hot pot, they also provided two dipping sauces - one being a chili oil and the other a sesame-like paste.  Everything was laid out nicely on a couple of tables along the back:   * octopus balls * beef balls * pork balls * wontons * dumplings * chicken * beef * pork * squid * mussels * shrimp * napa cabbage * spinach * bok choy * tofu * tofu sheets * flat rice noodles * vermicelli noodles  I'm sure they had a few other things that I forgot to mention.  Also in the broth was taro and radish.  For dessert, they offered complimentary red bean soup and fortune cookies.  Service was surprisingly attentive.  It was slow when we arrived shortly after 10 pm, and there were a few diners.  Business picked up with at least two large parties also enjoying the AYCE hot pot.  The staff was good at refilling our water, tea, and asking if we needed more broth in our pot.  They had a lot of staff around, so that was a good thing.  Late night AYCE Chinese hot pot begins at 9 pm!   3.5 stars
4 When we walked in the place, only three other tables were occupied and they soon left, leaving us the only diners in the place.  It was a Monday evening, after all.  My sinking feeling got worse when I saw therre was a fairly small (for a Chinese place) selection of poultry dishes.  I opted for sauteed shrimp and onions in a spicy garlic sauce and my wife ordered the sesame chicken.  Both were very good.  Mine was VERY good.  And being the only diners in teh joint, attentive service was a given.  This irestaurant is VERY seafood-oriented.  Recommended.
3 We ordered the beef chow fun, peppered beef, roast duck and garlic eggplant... All pretty good, especially the duck..  Pretty suprised for a place open late.. think they're open till 2am, but not sure. Gonna have to try the hot pot next time.
4 Outside building don't look so cool. Inside looks decent like other restaurants. They have really good service though. The food was pretty good, and I plan on going back there to eat again. I'd ordered the seafood clay pot, which was delicious. They made it spicy for us. The flavor was tasteful and not overwhelming. We also had the fried pork chop. I like the light salt and hot peppers seasoned over it. The pork chop had some parts too fatty though. They also brought out complimentary soup and green bean dessert drink for us. Next time, I will try their hot pots. It's a minimum of 2 people. I left the place indeed feeling joyful.
2 not as hot as i would have thought.   had 3x 10 people dinner tables.   Soup was bland, no taste, had to add vinegar and some pepper to bring out the taste (note~, i'm asian so i don't need a lot of MSG).   had 3 different kind of Seafood. One was Lobster entree and the other was Fish. 1 person i knew went back to the hotel and had a horrible stomach ache. 3 others has allergic reactions because of the seafood.   the place had pretty good business. I didn't order or choose what dishes we were going to have that night, but perhaps, if i ordered things that were more my style, it would be better?. Service was pretty good probably because we had 1lobster and 1 fish per table. I dunno the price but, 15/20 bucks per seafood entree multiply by 3 = a lot of money + tips. LOL
3 I went here for lunch the other day with some friends. I had the won ton noodle soup which was a little bland. The beef and broccoli was pretty good. We also had pork chops and pan fried noodles with sauce on top and both were also pretty good. Aside from the soup we had a good dining experience. The place was nice and the service was good. I heard that this place is conveniently open late. I may have to try this place when I am out late one night.
5 SHELLFISH ALLERGY? 6LB LOBSTER?  WHAT TO DO?  Lobster!  Duh.  So there was a small possibility that I might have had a shellfish allergy, but after my 6lb plate of deep fried lobster perfection, I think I can rest easy now.  Man, I had forgotten how great this place is for seafood.  Despite being "only kinda hungry" my group of four proceeded to order a 6lb deep fried lobster, XO beans, ong choy, soup, and steamed fish.    This is one of the best lobsters I've ever had.  Lightly dusted in cornstarch, salt, pepper, and crack(?), then quickly fried to perfection keeping the meat moist and succulent.  The pictures speak for themselves.  Plus they were having a 50% off special on lobster, so our titanic crustacean only cost us $100.   The only disappointment was the fish, not because it wasn't good, but because we had no idea it cost $59/lb!  That 1.5lb cost us as much as the lobster and wasn't worth it.  Next time we'll be sure to ask how much the fish costs before we order.    Other than that, a perfect meal.
5 Do you like fresh seafood? Like, it-was-swimming-two-minutes-ago fresh seafood? And would you like your seafood served in a simmering hotpot of wine, asian chiles and whole cloves of garlic? Then Joyful House may be for you.  Do you like noodles? How about tender cuts of beef stir-fried in a rich whole black bean and garlic sauce served atop large portions of rice noodles? Then Joyful House may be for you.  Lastly, are you intimidated by large menus offering delicacies you've never heard of? Well, then Joyful House will definitely be for you! they've got a fantastically broad and diverse menu... organized by protein and illustrated with large photos to tempt your tastebuds.  Joyful House has quick service, is clean (although the decor is a bit tired), and most importantly delicious. My favorite aspect, though, it that they are open until 3am! Perfect for a late night dinner date in Chinatown. I noted that they had a bar so you can order a cocktail, but I also noted they have a limited beer and wine selection. They serve Coke products and hot tea is complimentary. They have combination dinners available for 2 or more diners, but for the most part meals are served family style (which is my personal preference for Chinese restaurants anyway). They can accomodate tables of 2 or tables of 10 quite easily and our server was very nice.  We will definitely be visiting Joyful House again. We were so impressed with the seafood (delicious clams!), and we look forward to trying the roasted duck on our next visit. Highly recommended.
4 Awesome roasted duck, which I ordered based on my fellow yelpers reviews here.  Good call peeps!  I'm still drooling over that one. Also tried the combination pan fried noodles (with soft noodles) and it was quite good, although I only found 2 shrimp, they were big shrimp and extremely flavorful.  Seemed to have mostly pork in it, which was really good though.  Can't wait to go back and try their hot pots!  Extreme yum-quotient here, so check it out ASAP!    Also, thumbs up to their awesome interactive online menu.  All restaurants should have a web site like theirs.
4 The food is so good here. A must try is the roasted duck, salt and pepper lobster and combination fried noodles. Very high quality here. I wish there was a Joyful House in Orange County. The service is pretty good.
3 The food there is good but the customer service can be hit or miss. I can't even count how many times I've been there and the experience ranges from the most pleasant to the most bizarre.  One low point was when we wanted to order pork & scallops as an entree (I know it's an odd combo but my friend digs it!). We've ordered this many times before without having any issues. On this rare occasion when the moon was full... the guy wanted to charge us PER scallop. Weird!  Another time I was there I think they forgot to flavor the soup.  So as you can see I've had very odd experiences there but yet I keep coming back... Why? Because overall you get a lot for what you're paying and the food is good :)
5 the best chinese food in las vegas, by far
2 Not great, but at least not disgusting...  We picked this place by looking in the window and noticing there were customers, customers which were Chinese, no less!  This joint serves the typical Cantonese style chinese meal, I ordered the vegetarian noodle soup (think wonton noodle soup without the wontons and a bunch of blanched veggies on top).  The soup and noodles were passable, but the veggies were super bland.    Better than nothing.
5 Have gone to this place several times. The first time based on the reviews on Yelp.   Try the seafood with tofu in clay pot. Delicious. My wife raves about their salt and pepper pork chops; and seafood hotpot. My fav is always the chicken chow fun.   Last night had the dried chowmein and chicken...not so good this time. The noodles were wet, not crispy. Update: went there again last night with my mother-in-law from Ukraine. Her first Chinese food and she loves the seafood hotpot and chicken chow fun.  The tofu with veges are awesome. T  We have to try their crabs and lobster some day.
4 Surprisingly good Chinese food in Las Vegas!  I came here recently with my family and this was my first time in Vegas' Chinatown.  It's about 10-15 minutes (depending on traffic) off the Strip.  The restaurant was pretty empty for a Friday night dinner, but don't let that deter you from coming here.  We had the following:   1) Scallops in Black Bean Sauce - Pretty average dish.  2) Pan Fried Chilean Sea Bass in Garlic Soy Sauce - This was the daily special.  It's on their regular menu, but discounted from the regular price.  It's a thick fillet, not a whole fish, and I'd go with this over the scallops.  3) Crispy Fried Dungeness Crab with Salt and Pepper - I loved this dish!  The tempura batter was crisp and the seasoning was not overly salty.  The crab meat was hot and tender.  4) Crispy Fried Marinated Chicken - The crispy skin was fantastic.  The meat was fine.  5) Pan Fried Spinach in Garlic Sauce - Simple and good.  6) Wonton Noodle Soup - Good, but pricey.  I enjoyed our meal and the service was not bad with the exception of my drink order.  I wanted the Hong Kong Style Hot Tea with Cream, but they just couldn't get it right.  First, my drink never came.  We asked for it again and some more time passed before a cold mug of tea was brought out, ugh.  There wasn't even any cream in it!  We sent it back and the manager apologized for the server being new.  They have a lot of drink options, but since I didn't try mine I can't vouch for any.
4 This place was REALLY good.  My husband and I ordered the Family Meal B for 2, which came with so much food it could have fed 5!  And it was only $16 per person.   The food was really good too.  It came with hot and sour soup, egg rolls, dumplings, and another appetizer, pork fried rice, chicken chowmein, lemon chicken, and sizzling beef.  Seriously enough food to feed ALOT more than just 2.  Also, I forgot my credit card on the table and before I even made it out the door the waiter had handed it to me, making sure I didn't forget it. Also, the two hosts of the restaurant came to our table both while we ate, and after to make sure we had enjoyed our food.    Our 2 year old son also really enjoyed the huge fish tanks that had live fish and lobsters (which I'm sure were also on the menu).
3 I chop yo chicken!!! I chop yo chicken into small chunks. I don't mince yo chicken.... I just chop into tiny juicy pieces. This is the reason why the egg drop soup with minced chicken didn't suck. Unlike Most restaurants which tend to abuse their chicken (Capitol Seafood), Joyful did chicken right like your gams gams making homemade chicken soup. But not everybody is your gam gams, and most tend to abuse their chicken because chicken is so lean it leads to dry bland chicken bits that you will choke on (I just wanted to put "choke" and "chicken" in the same sentence).  The spicy and probably sour shrimp was decent, but not stellar although they did do a stand-up job on prepping those on-yerns (onions) which was sliced thinly - most Chinese restaurants will just quarter the onions.... slackers!  Also ordered the tau miu which was your standard garlic pea shoot vegetable dish. Nothing like your leafy green vegetables to keep you "regular"... this might be good for you, if you're one of those people that disappear for an hour or so with a magazine under your arm. FYI - I'm in'n'out in record time... the secret is "leafy greens".  The last dish was some beef dish with a generic indistinctive flavor. That's why I'll generically just say it was "decent".  The reason why I tried this place out, is because I can't stand getting screwed with all the high priced, hyped up crap on the strip. Instead, I like my "crap" off the strip.... speaking of crap, those leafy greens I had earlier is working their magic.
4 It has been a while and the menu we enjoyed ecapes me. The ambiance  is pretty standard of spring mountain area. The one thing that should stick out to the Yelp community is the SICK and I ain't kidding wine list. Joyful house is a regular stop for Hong Kong whales late night. They evidently  can't get enough vintage Bordeaux. There were 61's 82's 90's and a plethora of other rediculous vitages and other fun Germans as well. I am not convinced that most of the wine list paires with the food style but damn it is sexy reading.
4 For those of you who are going to order Kung-Pao whatever and Cashew whatever, Fried Rice, Egg Foo Young, or Egg Rolls,  then complain how it wasn't good, better not eat here.  This is a Chinese Restaurant.  I wouldn't go to a fine Mexican Restaurant and Order Nachos Bell Grande or Meximelts for dinner.  With that said,  finding a good Chinese Restaurant in a desert would be challanging.  I am writing this as a customer with lots of Chinese restaurants tested.   The ambience was conservative and they are open from 11am - 3am The price was a bit higher, but not outrageous, but this is Las Vegas. Good wine list, but not really apropo for some of the food here.  The seafood dishes we ordered were extremely fresh We had a Stir-fried scallop and veggie dish that tasted very fresh and was cooked perfectly. The sweet and pungent shrimp dish was very good. The sauce was made from fresh tomatoes and not ketchup like other restaurants. The Filet Mignon dish was very good The waiter had recommended the sauteed young pea leaves which btw was excellent. We had a Fried Tofu dish that was standard, nothing special. They used good quality rice for the steamed rice.  We skipped the pricier seafood dishes that spiraled near the $100 mark or more, but all in all we got out for $75.00 (not including tips) for 3 people. We were too full for dessert so no reviews here  I would have to say I definitely would make a return trip here when I am back in Las Vegas again.
2 We ate at Joyful House two saturdays ago. We ordered egg rolls, kung pao shrimp and roasted duck. The duck was a major disappointment. It looked decent at first, but once I dug in it was fatty, tough and grizzly. I've never had to work so hard to get to the meat before. Our waiter came by and asked how we were doing, I mentioned that the duck was very difficult to eat. He brought me wet naps. It was appreciated, but a knife might have been more helpful.   Photos are posted.
4 If ever there was a place away from the strip that offered great Chinese food, this is it. I love eating Chinese food, and the one thing that I use to gauge their greatness is honey walnut shrimp, or walnut prawns. This place has the best honey walnut shrimp in Vegas so far, and I base this on the food from home.  Watch how far you drive down Spring Mountain--this place is right off Decatur and Spring Mountain in a little strip. Although the building is a bright color, at night it is still easy to miss. Parking is a bit tight, but it is worth it!  When you walk in, the Buddha statue is at the entrance with piles of coins from customers on his belly. I always rub his belly when I walk in. The servers are very attentive--and all male--and there is no wait for a table. The menus are easy to read with the set dinners on the very first page, but if you feel adventurous, I would suggest the more foreign dishes to eat. They are truly authentic, serving black fungus and jellyfish, shark fin soup, among other things. Most Americans would never order these dishes, but trust me--you have to try it.  We ate the honey walnut shrimp (obviously), black fungus and season vegetables, braised tofu, wonton noodle soup, and jelly fish. It was all oustanding, all in their right sauces and the vegetables with that nice slight char from the breath of the dragon. The tofu was perfect, and the black fungus was cooked just right. I love cold jellyfish, and this was one of the best that I've had in Vegas.  Overall, the meal was outstanding and reminded me of the Joyful restaurant back home on Guam. We waited four minutes for our food, and everything was cooked perfectly, presented beautifully, and tasted spectacular.  Who says that you have to eat on the strip? Save some money and go to the side streets. You never know what gems you may find.
4 This was an easy late night staple and we've eaten here quite a bit of times. What we have gotten is pretty good and have not had a bad experience here yet. It's not the best I've had, but it is solid and specially when it comes to late night where most places go downhill in quality, I appreciate that it's consistent. We just get off of work, we're not drunk so we actually care what food tastes like.  They have stuff that serves more for a friendly palette but they also have legit dishes too and have tried quite a few of those are are indeed, authentic and want to note in particular that the seafood is fresh and fairly priced. Servers are pretty friendly here too, specially since the late night crew are the same, they are familiar with us and are attentive on the drinks refills  It's a good standby for late night eats. We are fairly regular here.
5 OMG! This may rank as one of the best Chinese restaurants in Vegas. I'm a local and just let me say this is not your average run-of-the-mill place. The service was great - the host was amazingly friendly and helpful from the moment we walked in the door - he even helped us order. Try the whole duck for about $14. Seriously - $14. It was great. We will definitely add this to list of great restaurants in Chinatown.
4 I just got home from dinner here with the family. There were 12 1/2 of us (lil madison isn't even big enough for a booster seat yet). I've been here many times already and always have a good experience, except for the one time I was here for lunch and the roast duck was all dried out. The staff is always super nice.  I was here on a Tuesday a couple weeks ago and the whole roasted duck was on special. We asked them about discounted whole duck tonight and they said it's only on special Monday through Friday.    I can't remember everything we ordered. We had to get 1 1/2 orders on most of the dishes. Here is what I do remember:  Roasted Duck - a whole one ("I'll have the chicken. A whole one") Pan Fried Fresh Scallop w/Broccoli Honey Walnut Prawns Sizzling Beef Tenderloin Mignon in Pepper Sauce Crispy Fried Whole Flounder Sole in Garlic Sauce Braised Tofu w/Black Mushroom in Brown Sauce Sweet & Sour Pork Fried Rice w/Salted Fish & Diced Chicken Beef Chow Fun Pan Fried Spinach in Garlic Sauce
3 I used to love this place, but over the years there have been many Chinese restaurants that have opened with better prices. Joyful has kept their price high.    The food is good, but pricier than others. My usual order at Joyful are:  Eggplant and Tofu Hotpot w/ Shrimp Paste Egg Foo Yung Shark's Fin Soup Green Beans with X/O Sauce Fried Tofu Salt & Pepper Pork Chop  Don't get me wrong, the food here is amazing but it is pricier than others so I give it A-OK.
4 This place is an excellent restaurant for Chinese food.  Definitely one of my all time favorite Chinese food restaurants to visit.  The food is always fresh and well prepared.  There is a wide variety of dishes to choose from with good portion sizes.  I could make a meal out of the appetizers alone.  The last few times I was there I have eaten the salt & pepper chicken, pork, shrimp; sweet & sour chicken, pork, shrimp; whole fried Flounder, honey/ walnut shrimp, seared scallops and most recently the Lobster w/ garlic and scallions.  Their Fried Rice dishes are also superb.  I have not been disappointed with this restaurant yet.
3 The best thing about this place?  Closes at 3 a.m.  Next best thing?  The service.  There are some nice folks here.  The food?  Just okay.  Also, all the seafood seemed extremely expensive.  And that comes from a guy who usually doesn't look at pricing.  The gf and I had:  - Cilantro, Preserved Eggs, & Sliced Fish Filet Soup (pretty good)  - Clams in Black Bean Sauce (nice and tasty clams)  - Sizzling Tenderloin Mignon in Black Pepper Sauce (sounds incredibly tasty, tastes like nothing)  - Chilean Sea Bass with Tofu & Black Mushrooms in Clay Pot (not a bad dish, but had I known the sea bass was going to be deep fried, I would have opted for the steamed version)  I think I also ordered one other dish, but for the life of me I can't remember.  Anyhoo, nothing really wowed us here.  Plus, we polished all of our food, which surprised us, because we thought we'd get bigger portions than we did.
3 It's open till 3am, so it's got that going for it. It's decent, not OMG great, but at 1am and Ichiza's packed and you've been burned-out of Shuseki, Joyful's a good place to go. I've gotten the Hong Kong style beef chowmein, and it was good. The salt and pepper porkchop was -meeeh-. Not as good as others i've had. No black pepper is used, just jalapeno.(not a huge fan of it)  Good for late-night Chinese cravings.
4 Joyful House is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in town, and I come here quite often because of it's convenient hours (open til 3 am, I believe), and it's great food.  They have a large selection of live seafood to choose from, all coming from the tanks they have in the middle of the restaurant.  A sign acts as the menu with the prices for the fresh fish and seafood of the day.  They have different sized lobsters, crab, snapper, sea bass, and many others.  Seafood is not all they do well, though.    The Mongolian Beef is very good, as well as the Pork Chops with Salt & Pepper.  I also really like their Roasted Duck, which is a huge portion that serves a lot of people.  I usually try to come to Joyful House with a lot of people because their portions are large, making it a very affordable feast for lots of hungry people.    The prices are a about a dollar more per item than most Chinese restaurants in the area, but it's worth it with the quality of food you get from Joyful House.  The price might also be attributed to the nicer ambiance you get here.  The waiters are professionally dressed, and the decor is fancier than most places.  The tables are well set, and the plates and silverware are even of good quality.    If you're looking for a nice Chinese dinner with a lot of people, go to Joyful House.  Great food, great service, great restaurant!
4 Came here for lunch with my Fiance. We ordered 2 things and became instant fans.  - Salty fish & chicken fried rice.  Plenty of salty fish & chicken bits.  Not over oily.  Not too salty.  Just right.  - Shanghai Dumplings aka Xiao Lung Bao.  OMG.  These are delicious.  The skin was perfect.  Not too thick and not too thin so the soup stayed where it belongs - inside the dumpling.  I was shocked to find out that it was only the 2nd day since they began selling these.  The waiter said that they were doing a test run to see how people would like it.  If I lived in the area, I would definitely come back for these dumplings.  With the first bite you can tell that they use high quality ingredients and they don't skimp on the meat at all.  Okay, so maybe we're more fans of the xiao lung bao.  I'll have to revisit the next time I'm in LV.  In the mean time, you really need to come and try these before they stop making them.  This might turn their lunch business around!
4 Seriously great Chinese seafood.  Right now, you can get the live spot prawns WITH their eggs.  Don't pass this up.  They are $10 each but well worth it.  Could have eaten six and call it a meal.  The eggs taste like millions of fresh shrimp.  The head is soooo creamy.  The tail so sweet!  The honey walnut prawns are equally good although more common.  The Chinese spinach also deserves special mention.  This place is known for seafood and that's what you should eat.  You can get duck anywhere right.  Service is excellent.  The decor is upscale.  They are open real late (3am) so get your fix whenever you like.
4 Came here in a group of 5. We were actually planning on going to another restaurant, but it was packed and we came across this place.   I was a little late, so when I arrived all the food was already there. We got crispy noodles, garlic crab, honey walnut shrimp, duck, and soup. I have no complaints at all about the food, it was all delicious.  The waiter was pretty friendly and efficient as well. He always filled up our water glasses once they reached halfway and took away our plates the second we were done.   I'd like to come back. The prices are cheap, the portions are large, and the food is good.
4 Stopped by here after a late night of casino hopping. I wouldnt say it's the best chinese food ever, but it did the job especially for late night. Plus that it opens til 3am.
5 My favourite Chinese food in Las Vegas.  Very nice staff and great food.
4 January 31 2011. Dinner.  We had the Sizzling Rice Seafood Soup first.  The Flavor of the broth and fish was wonderful, however the calamari pieces were as chewy as slices of rubber tire, completely inedible. But alas, don't fret...  The Crispy Fried Chilean Sea Bass with S&P was completely without fault. Absolutely full of flavor, very fresh tasting (and i'm extremely conscience of fish freshness). A large center slice of Seabass. Just lovely.  We also had the Sauteed Prawns in Spicy Sweet and Sour Sauce which was very good.  in addition to the incredible menu choices, they have several live seafood tanks with a variety of seafood; prawns, geoduck, shellfish, other live fish.    Atmosphere was marred by this random table in the middle of the walkway heading to our booth - this oddly placed table was covered in clean restaurant dishes, glasses, napkins, and brickabrack of things that are usually hidden at the back or behind a divider, not sitting in the middle of the restaurant.  At first glance, I thought they weren't ready for business yet, but there were patrons inside and that table never disappeared. O, well.  The food was reasonably priced and delicious. Definitely recommend.  http://www.joyfulhouselv.com/menu.html
2 My wife (Chinese), her business partner and I booked a table here for Chinese New Year's Eve.  From glowing reviews, I was stoked about a great seafood meal, perhaps like I had while living in China for 10 years.  Pity.  No such luck.  The char su (bbq pork) was lean, alright, but chewy like jerky.  And cold.  Noodles were served immediately, when any self-respecting Chinese restaurant owner knows that the "pasta is served at the end!"  At least along side the steamed fish.  Pacing is critical in a good Chinese restaurant with courses arriving at appropriate intervals.  The 'highly recommended' shrimp dish was laden with red sauce.  Very Midwestern and sweet - with all due respect to my Midwestern friends, whose steak and pizza I adore.  In a word, "Fake".  And not cheap!  It may be worth a second try, but I may venture to other places along Spring Mountain to find a great kitchen.  Not the best way to begin the Year of the Rabbit.  Now that's a dish served well and spicy in Beijing.
2 The service here was good but the portions for the price and the quality was not. Yes the food did taste good but nothing really stood out. I guess since I live near the san gabriel area im pretty much used to this type of food at a more reasonable price. Good dishes to get here are the black bean sauce clams, stir fried string beans,  and fried salt and pepper sea bass. Parking is easy and the wait isn't long.
5 I'm ashamed to say tonight was my first trip to joyful house. I've heard a dozen times that it is the best Chinese food in Las Vegas and my husband is Chinese but I never went!  Well, it lived up to the rave reviews. The food was excellent. Zero complaints. Even the service, which generally leaves much to be desired at Chinese places, was friendly and attentive.   We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, beef chow fun, Mongolian beef, and spicy string beans with minced pork. The calamari was perfection. Nuf said. Ooh and a surprise of crispy jalapeños were mixed in. The string beans were flavorful, fresh, and crisp. The Mongolian beef melted in your mouth. Not a single hint of the tough, chewy, overcooked beef you may have encountered elsewhere.   No culinary surprises here. Classic Chinese cuisine done right. Really right.
4 What a nice way to end a busy day of running errands in the Vegas heat. My best friend, her family and I came here around 10:30pm. It had been ages since my last visit (I think I was 10 years old or so) ,so I couldn't exactly remember what the food tasted like, but at the moment I was up for anything in the Chinatown area.   We ordered:   Cream of Chicken and Corn Soup- pretty standard soup. It reminded me of egg flower soup with cream of corn. I don't know if I'd order this again because it wasn't anything special. I think I'd prefer won ton soup over this.    Beef & Broccoli- I was a little skeptical about ordering this dish because I always try to order things that you can't get at other places. This dish you can order anywhere and I was sort of sick of it from places like Panda. However, that is only due to the fact that I forgot how much better it tastes at authentic Chinese restaurants. Beef was chewy and tender, while the stems of the broccoli was soft. The sauce was typical and there was a perfect amount to moisten the dish up and I'm tough critic when it comes to dryness. I couldn't believe at how much the dish amazed me as if it was my first time trying it.   Honey Walnut Shrimp- one of my all time favorites at any Chinese restaurants. Joyful House will not disappoint because theirs definitely meets the standards. The batter of the shrimp was the perfect thickness, good ratio of shrimp to walnut and the mayonnaise glazed the entire dish perfectly. Loved this!   Steamed Flounder- just as good as it is anywhere else. My dad also cooks this at home and now I honestly don't find this dish as amusing as I did before. But I'm sure for everyone else they still love it. The fish is very light that is balanced with the soy sauce and oil. The chopped scallions also adds a nice touch, almost like sprinkles on a sundae. On another note, the fish came with all the bones intact and the server meticulously de boned the entire fish at the table. I was truly impressed because the fish still held up it's shape and it wasn't distorted into pieces (if that was my job, it would have been another story). My best friend and I both chatted about how it was our first time experiencing such an art. Apparently all Chinese restaurants are suppose to do this.   Thank you Joyful House! I was so caught up with the hype of other Asian cuisines from sushi to banh mis that I had forgotten the Chinese were the first to make a good impression on Americans. No wonder, your food is absolutely delicious and will always be considered the Asian classic. You may now be my Chinese restaurant fix when I'm in the Chinatown area.
5 BOMB.COM  Hands down the best Chinese restaurant in Vegas.   Sweet & Sour Shrimp: spot on, shrimp was cooked perfectly. Fried Whole Fish: It's like a deep fried fish chip. Delicious. Honey Walnut Shrimp: Light on the mayo, perfectly cooked. Fried Crispy Tofu w/ Shrimp Paste: Probably my favorite dish, the dipping sauce is to die for.  Anyways, those are the dishes I've tried and all have been great. My only qualm with this place is the prices are just a tad bit more than what I'm used to in California, but hey it's worth it!
4 I haven't had Chinese food in a while so I took advantage of the fact that my husband wasn't hungry. (He doesn't really eat Asian food) I didn't order much because I knew I would be the only one eating. The crispy lemon chicken sounded good so I ordered that with a side of white rice. It was good especially liked the pieces of lemon. If you order this it's best to eat it there. It gets too soggy the next day ...even if you bake it. I'd like to come back and try the Walnut Shrimp, Fried Rice, and some Chow Mien. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!
5 It doesn't get more joyful than this people.  Lunch special is sick and you can easily share with a group and at $7.50 for an eggroll, curry puff, soup, entree selection, and a limitless drink.  You can't go wrong.  Open till 3 am people so anyone who gets out as late as I do and wants to get their chinese food on, go.  Only place I can take my man for chinese food that he actually likes and he is super picky about his asian food.   Out of all the joints in chinatown to eat, best HONEY WALNUT SHRIMP  to date. Nuff said!
5 Amazing! I had been looking for a great Chinese place in town, and randomly stumbled upon Joyful House.  I had the Half Shell Steamed Oysters with Black Bean sauce, which were absolutely fantastic and fresh. The delivery person arrived there after we had been told they were out of oysters, so these were very very fresh.   I also had the Crispy Fried Tofu stuffed w/ Shrimp Paste. It came with slices of eggplant as well - and the whole thing was delicious.   To top it all off, we added some chicken fried rice. My expectations with fried rice are pretty basic, and this easily met those. Fried rice is basically fried rice....it's fairly easy for a good Chinese restaurant to not screw this up.  I was pleasantly surprised by their extensive wine menu. I didn't happen to order a $1,500+ bottle of Petrus nor Lafite, but it was nice to see that was an option. ;)  For those of us who aren't on CEO incomes, they had plenty to choose from, and I opted for a $9/glass Merlot.  Total cost for two people - those three dishes and a glass of wine - was about $40. Bottom line: incredible food, friendly service, and a definite place for repeat visits.
5 This is place is legit!  The food here was awesome and the service was great.  I was with a group so we collectively ordered a whole bunch of stuff but I opted for the Hong Kong style Shrimp plate and the Steamed Tofu with Chinese Greens.  The Hong Kong noodles were perfect and not overly saucy like some of the other places I've tried in Chinatown.  I love the crunchiness of the noodles and the amount of sauce was perfect and kept the outer edges of the noodles crunchy enough to enjoy.  The tofu came out soft, hot, and ready to consume.  Nothing too special going on with the tofu but that's actually how I expected it to be so I was okay with it.  The servers were friendly and checked up on us without being so overbearing about having enough of anything or whether I needed more water after taking 2 sips.  Overall, a great experience!  Will return to grub again soon.
4 Been here 2 or 3 times now. Easy to find parking (right outside restaurant), good service, medium sized place, good portions, tasty food and not too oily.  The last time I went, we ordered:  - Sizzling Beef Tenderloin Mignon in Pepper Sauce - Very tender, delicious, tons of onions - Pan Fried Spinach in Garlic Sauce - tasty - Combination Pan Fried Noodle - nice and crispy - Beef Chow Fun in Black Bean Sauce - yum! - Fried Rice w/ Salted Fish & Diced Chicken - small bits of salted fish here and there that are easy to mistake for chicken until you taste it  Great place for Chinese Food in Vegas! (especially if you need to eat dinner early because you have a show to watch or if you want a break from buffets)
5 Before I moved to Las Vegas, my full knowledge of Asian food was Panda Express. (Not that I'm not going to give it up.) As I've been here, Elite Emily (and LChee before he abandoned me) started dragging me into real Asian food, and of the places we've been so far, this is my favorite Chinese place. For those who are adventurous, eggplant clay pots and various prawns and what not are available for your dining palate, but if you have friends who are new to Asian or Chinese food, basic but delicious items are available, such as fried rice, sweet & sour pork, and lemon chicken. Last night I had the orange blossom beef. Simple but tasty with a delicious sauce.  Afraid to try other cuisines? Go to Joyful House, they can ease you into it. The staff is helpful too; if you have questions, they'll fill you in!
4 I'm quite surprised I haven't written a review for this place already.   In a town lacking in quality Chinese cuisine, this is a shining star. I used to be a regular a few years back, but since discovering lots of other treats around town and becoming an addict for trying something new each time I go out, I have neglected poor Joyful House.   I have never had a bad meal here. They have lots of selection and their staff is extremely friendly and welcoming! Some of my favorites are Peking Duck, Eggplant and Pork Claypot, Salt & Pepper Prawns and too many more dishes that I can't think of off the top of my head. They have something for everything. Orange Blossom Beef for the less adventurous in your group or Steamed Fish and Sea Cucumber for the authentic Chinese Food Palates.  They have great hours, open late for you night owls and great food. I have tried quite a number of dishes on their menu and I haven't ever really been disappointed. I have to make sure I keep them in my rotation more often now that I'm reminded. YUM.
5 Way to close to the strip to be missed fresh seafood tanks friendly staff the salt and pepper calamari. you know you are at the right place when you are the only table that is all Chinese
5 awesome food!   never left this place disappointed. i discovered this place a few years ago and became an instant fan! i try something new every time. the honey walnut shrimp was surprisingly good i didnt think i was gonna like it but i did. salt and pepper pork chops were cooked perfectly cooked, a nice crispy and tender in the middle. cant remember the other dishes my friends ordered but i couldnt find anything wrong with the dishes we shared.   the prices on the other hand i remembered them to be slightly lower before. but none the less still an awesome meal to end a vegas trip!
5 This place had a big hype to live for when I first visited.  A lot of my friends kept telling me of this place.......and they were right.  The restaurant itself does not really stand out for me, typical looking, but the food was very good.  My favorite was the honey walnut shrimp. I always loved that dish and this place did not fail in making it good.  My friends ordered the spicy salt and pepper pork chops.  That was very tasty and was how it should be, crispy outside, but moist and tender inside.  It really is easy to eat here, if you're in a buig group like we were, just order a bit of everything and everyone just picks off different plates.  This place is a defiantly to come back to and I'm a fan now.
2 Overrated and overly priced. The food was half decent and the customer service wasn't that great - had to ask for our water 3 times.   Lobster and Dungeness crab was 3-4 times more expensive than a normal chinese restaurant - $65 per pound for lobster, I might as well eat at an actual 5 star restaurants in a 5 star casino.  Don't come here unless you want to waste your money.  If you're going to spend this much money, I recommend Blosom restaurant located inside the Aria Casino and Resort.  My review might be harsh because I've had better food or the same food quality for a much lower price.
5 Best Chinese in town.  Been coming here for over 10 years.  Love it.
5 Best chinese food so far in Vegas. It's a little more expensive than other similar restaurants but worth it.
4 We went there on our first date.   We were greeted by a friendly hostess.   Our server on the other hand, didn't speak English very well. We did manage to get our order in by ordering by number on the menu. He meant well though. lol  We started with the salt and pepper calamari, it was delicious but she didn't have any. She is allergic to seafood and vegetarian, I know! But we pressed on through dinner..lol  I had the seafood hot pot which was amazing, it was perfectly cooked  and so flavorful.   She had the vegetarian hot pot with tofu. Although I'm not a big fan of tofu. it was pretty damn good.  It was also my first time having a drink with those tapioca balls. At first, it was hard to get used to, the straws were so wide, it felt quite weird but the tapioca balls were good. (no pun intended) lol  This place has been around for years and really does it right.
2 I was so excited because when I called this place to place an order, the guy actually spoke enough English that I thought I didn't have any problems talking to him! I always order Chicken and Broccoli, and since I've moved here from the East Coast I have noticed a lot of places put mushrooms in it. I don't want mushrooms, chicken and broccoli, I want chicken and broccoli. So I thought I would be smart and ask whether or not it had mushrooms before I ordered it. He said no, reassuring me that there wasn't and then asked me if I wanted American broccoli or Chinese broccoli. I thought all broccoli was the same, but silly me. So I said American, being safe. Well I received me food and found mushrooms all over the dish. I guess he didn't understand as much English as I gave him credit for!
3 As far as food is concerned it is good. As far as what we got for our reunion "Chinese banquet" dinner -- not so much. However, having said that, it is tough to organize a banquet for a large group and I felt we were jipped in price for what we got. I know if I went to the restaurant myself and ordered the same dishes, it would've cost much less.  Still, our dishes were good. We had:  Salt and pepper calamari -- your standard Chinese restaurant fare, good with tons of garlic  Fried veggie rolls -- I would've preferred these rolled in beancurd sheets, but what the hell  Shrimp with broccoli was nice, shrimp were plump, large and snappy.  Peking duck -- this was sad as there was a measly piece of duck in a huge bao   Black pepper steak with portabello mushrooms -- strange combination but what the hell, it was good  Steamed flounder -- okay I mean I order this dish often and it rarely runs more than $10-$12 a pop so don't sell it as something expensive PLEASE!  Stir fried green beans -- this was done really well with bits of preserved turnip greens in it. LOVED it.  Braised duck E-fu noodles -- okay, epic fail because these were not E-fu noodles. They looked and tasted more like regular egg noodles. I was so damn disappointed because I love E-fu noodles and these were not it.  At the end of the day, this meal did not constitute $50/head even with a few bottles of wine and beer thrown in. PUH-LEEZ! Only about 30% of the people had drinks. I think I was more upset that it was $50/head. I know if we had just gone in ourselves and ordered this menu, we would've easily walked away paying no more than $25/person tax and tip included.
5 All I can say is WOW!! Well maybe I can say more than that, AUTHENTIC, FRESH, FRIENDLY, DELICOUS. They brought out our seafood alive prior to cooking so that we knew that our meal was fresh. EAT HERE!! It is only minutes from the strip. The staff at these off srtip places are so greatful to have you there they make the experience one of a kind with their attentiveness. SUCH AMAZING CHINESE FOOD!!
4 I feel like lately I've only been reviewing places I didn't like so now I am going to pick a place I like and review it.  I've been to Joyful House many times and it's pretty consistently good.  My favorite thing to get here are the steamed oysters that you order individually.  I rarely am able to find this dish anywhere else but it is just so amazing.  Oysters steamed with black bean sauce and globs of garlic on top...How could that ever not be good?  Other stuff I've had that were really good are: Sizzling Scallops with Black Bean Sauce and Steamed Live Rock Cod (at $80 it was a little pricey but it was divine).  Most of other items I've had were decent.  The only thing I've had here that was bad was the dessert.  I ordered the ice cream mochi and the mochi skin was dried up and not chewy, probably due the packaging not being sealed properly.  I might've been able to send it back but I didn't ask.  The fried ice cream wasn't good either.  Oh, and this place is open til 3am!  Ideal for blowing some money on seafood after a night of fruitful gambling (or eating your sorrows away if you lose).
1 This place had good food...but served 5 different varieties of Shark Fin soup.  'Nuf said.
4 This was the first chinese restaurant I came to when I moved to Las Vegas 13 years ago.  It is where I would take out after getting off of work late at night, or after a late night of anything.  Is it the best Chinese food in Vegas?  Nope, but I give it 4 stars for consistently satisfying my hunger and cravings.
3 We went for lunch after a hike at Red Rock.  We both got a lunch special which comes with a curry wonton, egg roll, rice and egg drop soup.  I ordered the salt and pepper shrimp.  These were whole large shrimp cooked shell and head on.  I didn't taste much pepper, more of a salt and garlic shrimp.  They were hot and sauteed with jalepenos.  He got the Kung pao chicken and had a taste.  It wasn't that spicy, though the veggies were very fresh.  The sauce was really sweet to me though.  The pork fried rice was okay, had nice big chunks of pork in it.    This was a nice change than restaurants off the strip.  The service was really good and prices were great for lunch.
5 Excellent Chinese food - real Chinese food!!    We ordered the house soup - which turns out to be free!  I like free soup!  Pork bones soup.  Delicious.  There was a special on flounder so we decided to try it steamed with soya sauce and Chinese wine and ginger, garlic and green onion for $19.95.  Such delicate taste.    The other dish to die for is the Rosy Duck - 1/2 order - skin so crispy and the meat so tender.    We also ordered the braised tofu and black mushrooms with choy sum.   Good dish.  Also, Chinese brocolli or kai lan with garlic - very green and fresh with loads of garlic!    Free Chinese dessert of the day was red bean soup.  Very well done.
5 5 stars not just for being open until 3am but for providing consistently great food until the wee hours of the night.  I used to come here a lot more (when I had a well-employed boyfriend who always paid!).  Since it's been frugal times around these parts I've been going out to eat a lot less.  This weekend we had a late night out and forgot to eat dinner, I suggested this place because I remembered the hours and how good the food was.  So we rolled in at about 1am, no problem getting a table!  The service was great and the food was as yummy as I remembered.  The menu is huge so you can have more traditional REAL Chinese food and Americanized versions, too.  And the kill tanks are pristine!
4 Far and away the best Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas. I'm fairly contrarian if you've read my reviews, but I agree here. I'd give it 5 stars, but it's not the old Say Eng Look in New York's Chinatown, which was the best ever for me.
4 I love it. Really Quality food with excellent service all served up with a smile. Seriously, awesome staff and particularly fresh items from this place. I've heard so many awesome things and it did not disappoint.   Scallops, "street noodles" and one of my favorites - garlic baby bok Choy... Even the house soup of the day.. Simple, and delicious. So awesome. I'll be back :)  It's open very late and you will be happy you went if you are fan of Chinese/Asian flavors.
4 Definitely love the half price lobster when they had the special. I ordered the lobster with thai chili sauce and it was to die for. I ordered the lobster fried with xo sauce before and it wasn't as good as the thai chili style. Honey walnut prawns were the best. Fried sea bass was fresh too. baby bok choi with garlic was a little greasy but perfect. Word of advice, take a chinese friend with you who knows how to order cuz the experience will b 10,000 times better.
4 This was our second time coming here, and we enjoyed it just as much as the first time.  We actually came specifically for the salt and pepper fried tofu with garlic, which was amazing!  The pieces of tofu are perfectly deep fried, but not oily, and the tofu inside is so soft.  We also had garlic gai lan (Chinese dark green vegetable) and a sizzling platter with beef and onion.  The food was all excellent.  I wish we had the lobster/crab special, but we were on a budget.  The service is just OK, but typical of a Chinese restaurant.  This place was named best Las Vegas Chinese restaurant in 2010.
4 We ended up here at 2 in the morning and the food was amazingg! I had the sizzling chicken/veggie platter and some crispy salt & pepper pork spare ribs. I drank a crap ton of that jasmine tea, I guess I was dehydrated or something, I wonder why lol.   It was a perfect way to end a dizzying night on the strip.
4 Having lost my shirt at the roulette table only a few minutes earlier, my friends and I decided that we need some good old comfort Chinese food.  Hubby pulled out his new phone and found this place.  We hopped into our rental van and away we went.  It was about 9:30 when we strolled in - understandably, the place was deserted.  They tried to seat us directly in front of the entrance but were quite accommodating when we asked for a table more out of the way.    Prices are higher here, compared to your typical Chinese/HK style seafood restaurant.  Portions are skimpy...but the food sure tasted delicious!    We ordered 6 dishes plus a 1.5 order of the fish maw and crab meat soup which worked out perfectly for all of us.   Scallop w/ Snow Pea - taste was good but the scallops were scarce Salt/Pepper Pork Chops - good tasty, not-as-greasy version Salt/Pepper Flounder Filets - great batter, very light and airy...a big hit with our table Clay Pot shrimp pasted-stuffed tofu with eggplant - again, it worked out to 6 pieces of tofu and 5 pieces of eggplant.  but I could eat the sauce for days. Chinese broccoli sauteed in garlic - some of you know that Chinese broccoli can be old and tough.  But this dish used greens which turned out to be very tender and perfectly seasoned Clams in black bean sauce - probably the least remarkable of the dishes.  A number of the clams were cracked (did they drop them from high above into the wok???) and the sauce could have used a few more black beans.  Service was attentive, possibly because there were only 2-3 tables occupied by the time things got rolling for us.  The bus boy was on top of the tea and rice and our dishes came out long before our stomachs started roiling from hunger.  This was a great meal and helped to drive away the sting of losing at roulette...as well as the cold weather outside.
4 This is definitely the best Chinese in town. It has become part of our Christmas Eve tradition (Chinese and A Christmas Story), but I would eat it anytime. Our must haves are:  Salt and Pepper Pork Chops - SO delicious! Small pieces of pork that are breaded and fried. They are served with some salt and peppers for just the nicest hint of spice. Seriously you must try these!  Beef Chow Fun w/ Soy Sauce - Nice thick noodles in a savory brown sauce. The most perfect Chinese noodle dish.  We also enjoy the sesame chicken (although not the best I have had), Mongolian beef, and the sauteed sliced chicken with cashew nuts. Definitely some great food, although they have shark fin soup on the menu which really irks me, tisk tisk Joyful House. Such a deplorable practice (stepping off soap box). Other than that, the food is delicious and worth a trip next time you find yourself in Chinatown.
3 Used to go to Joyful House for the oysters in black bean sauce which was wonderful. Went tonight and yesterday and they did not. have my oysters. The restaurant is behind the times. No brown rice, you have to say "no msg"... Get with the program. Seafood is pricy and mediocre. If you are going to charge the same amount as Jasmin in the Bellagio, then bring on the waterworks show and delicious food. I'm not going back there. Money is not the issue--the quality has gone down.  I am merely recommending Jasmine as an alternate spot.
4 The food was very good (my wife and I chose Family Dinner B) and the service was great.  I especially like the Hot & Sour soup, which is not easy to get right.  This was both heat enough and sour enough.  It makes it even better that they're open until 3AM.  I'll definitely be back for more!!!
3 kind of expensive and not the best... expected more from a place where the other restaurants are soo good...
5 Authentic! Huge Menu Selections! Great for vegetarians since they have a huge selection of veggies. But also fabulous for the carnivores since they carry from all sorts of seafood, shark fin, big no-no to all sorts of land animals.  Try any of the Ducks   Late night they have the all you can eat hotpot. You pick your meats and veggies and cook it at your table in a rich clear broth $15.95.
2 The past few times I have visited Vegas, I have been in search of a damn good Chinese restaurant.  The mister was craving some Chinese food, so we busted out Yelp on his iPhone and Joyful House was highly recommended.  Per some suggestions made by other Yelpers, I ordered the pan fired spinach in garlic sauce, the sauteed shrimp in sweet and sour sauce, e-fu noodles, and 1/2 order of peking duck.   The food was alright.  Nothing that kicked my socks off.  The peking duck was dry and slightly rubbery.  Also, they didn't even serve it with the bao bread or those puffy chips.  I liked the e-fu noodles, but it was a tad bit salty.  The shrimp was average and the spinach is something I could've cooked, so it wasn't special to me.    If this place is the best Chinese restaurant in Vegas, then I am afraid to try the other places.  Perhaps I have higher expectations since I have tasted great Chinese food back in Cali like in Chinatown, Monterrey Park, Alhambra, Rowland Heights, etc. I won't give up, the next time I am in Vegas, I will try another place and see how it is.
4 Good food and fast service! The best part is that they're open late!
3 I hate posting mediocre reviews but it's hard for me to rave about this place. I went last night with my husband at around 1AM. We were the only people there, which is odd to see anywhere in Vegas but my husband used to come here years ago so we figured to give it a try.  We ordered  honey walnut shrimp, it was really salty but pretty good.   The XO Green beans were amazing, I could have  had that alone.   We also tried the crispy pan fried combo. It was TERRIBLE. The beef and chicken were gray and rubbery. It was completely inedible. The noodles were soggy and not crispy. Thumbs down there.   Overall, I would go back because of the countless 5 star reviews.  Maybe we caught them on a bad night,
1 I really wanted to love this place. Sadly, I did not.  I met up my cousin there and we ordered the Green Beans with spicy XO sauce and Beef and Broccoli (cliche, I know). My cousin ordered the beef and broccoli because she didn't know what else to get. I ordered the green beans because they were seemingly vegetarian. Not even a minute after sitting down, the server approached me and asked if we knew what to order. Calm down lady! I just got here! After I told her I wasn't, I didn't see her for 20 minutes. I hate when that happens. I asked the server if the green beans were vegetarian and she confirmed. I asked if I could add tofu and she said I couldn't. Bummer, but not a deal breaker.   The dishes arrive and the first thing my cousin mentions is how slimy the beef was in her dish. I didn't taste them, but I could see the slime gleaming from the beef. Gross. I didn't mind my green beans until I got a tiny piece of fish. After that, I still kept eating. I ate some more and found 2 pieces of pork. What the hell is this?! Under no circumstances should this be acceptable. This is a sign of an unsanitary restaurant.  I immediately stopped eating. I still paid and tipped as usually. I don't know why I still didn't make a big deal out of this experience. Well I sure as hell did once my stomach started to churn about 10 minutes after leaving. I spoke to a family member who said that her Chinese friend told her that even if a Chinese restaurant says that a dish is vegetarian, chances are that they're still cooked in lard. The only exception is if the restaurant specializes in vegetarian/vegan food. This made me remember why I originally became a vegetarian, believe it or not. My body does not do well with meat or seafood.
5 By far the BEST chinese food in Vegas! I love everything and everything on the menu. Two dishes that could eat eVery single day never get tired of it. Salt and pepper pork chops/ green beans with xo sauce. The salt and pepper pork chops are no words describe except need too try it. It crispy on the outside with prefect light crispy type batter, the inside is spot on moist, and the flavor there sooo much depth. U bite into crispy outside crust then hit moist spot on cook pork chop and combine it with salt/pepper flavors. Divine. The string beans with xo sauce can say EXACT same thing feel eat it. The greens beans nice green, fresh, spot on cook bean that snap into them, and the sauce that the key nice spicy but not too much. I also like their mongolian beef, and any of noodle dishes are excellent!   The waitress sometimes hit or miss keeping up with your drinks being filled. Overall never had problem with the waitstaff.
4 People, I have finally found an amazing Chinese joint here in Vegas!  Who would have thought that it was going to be in Chinatown on Spring Mountain! LOL. This place got great reviews from my Elite friend, Jessica P.  Here's what we got:  Beef Chow Fun in Soy Sauce for $9.95.  Really flavorful, love the chow fun noodles, super soft with green onions.  Crispy Salt and Pepper Pork Chops for $10.95.  They said it was hot but it's not as hot as I thought.  There were jalapenos and red peppers.  This was AH-MAZE-ING.  The pork chops were perfectly cooked, batter was crispy and nice marbelized ratio.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT DISH.    General Chow Chicken for $10.95.  Lots of flavor, great batter, included carrots and peas.  The sauce was a little too salty for me but if you like oyster, soy and other sauces combined, get this dish.  Crispy Fried Lemon Chicken for $10.95.  People, I have FINALLY found the perfect lemon chicken dish in Vegas.  The chicken was crispy, the lemon sauce was perfectly made and this dish made my meal!    Crispy Fried Dungeness Crab with Salt and Pepper for MKT PRICE.  PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU CONFIRM THEIR PRICE.  We kept asking the server the price and it sounds like she was saying $6.95 and we kept asking her, however it turned out to be $16.95 and threw us for a loop when the check came.  I did like how they brought out the live crab in a bucket before cooking it.  It was juicy, crispy and perfectly flavored.     The place has a lot of stuff going on.  To me, the typical Chinese restaurant, full of Chiness decor and statues.  Round tables, only thing missing is a lazy Susan LOL.  They even ask if you want an ocean view seat, which is in front of a big fish tank.  The staff is on it.  They always refilled our drinks when the glass was 75% full.  I think that our little misunderstanding of the crab price was the only thing that I did not enjoy.  The staff kinda got a little impatient with us but other than that, I WILL BE BACK!
5 Phenomenal Chinese food.  The green beans with XO was probably the best dish.  The salt and pepper crispy pork and duck appetizer were also very good.  The beef chow fun noodles were acceptable but I have had better.  Overall one of the Chinese places in Vegas.
5 Great food. Wonderful find.
4 I was pleasantly surprised with this place. I took the recommendation from yelp. My friends and I came here recently and really enjoyed dinner. We're all Asian and we've been to numerous Chinese restaurants in San Francisco, Orange County, Los Angeles, New York, etc. and this place wasn't too bad at all. Prices were really reasonable and the servers were all friendly. Absolutely no complaints here. We will be back. Great job...joyful time!
4 Went here for my sisters graduation because we were all craving Chinese food. One of my sisters friends insisted this place was good so we went. We ordered 3 orders of Honey Walnut Shrimp and that thing disappeared in a heart beat. The food was really good and the service and pricing were just okay. Go here if you are craving good Chinese food. I recommend it!
4 Yelp Challenge 365 # 177/365  Seafood at its best!!!! I would never have found this place if not for Rod U who kindly directed me to several places in the great city of Las Vegas.  Unfortunately, there were no spot prawns when we dined but chose crab and shrimp in a basket with garlic and vegetables... we were there for lunch so it was just the right amount= not to heavy and enough to satisfy our appetite. Noodle dish? Cake noodle topped with more seafood and a side dish of green beans (lots of chili pepper with it too !)  The food was excellent by taste and the service as excellent. Oh, parking was plentiful compared to other restaurants and shops in the Vegas Chinatown district.   A definite stop if you're into seafood, chinese style!
5 Ooooh, yeah. We had a hard time choosing dishes to order because everything sounded good! They brought out the food really fast. We ended up getting 4 dishes for 3 people and thought we would have leftovers. Nope. Cleaned every plate. They also gave us the baby tapioca for dessert. We also ordered a red bean shaved ice. It was a little too sweet, so we just diluted with water. Satisfied my craving for chinese food. Their food hits the spot!
4 Purpose of visit: late night dinner after watching the pacqiano fight. He was so robbed by the way. We decided to head to Chinatown for some Kate night Cantonese food. Joyful house is open late. We ordered salt and pepper shrimp with the skin on. A must try the shrimp were fried enough to make the skin crisp and you old eat it in one bite. Fantastic flavor. Salted fish in clay pot was a also a good choice. The tofu was tender and the fish slightly tender. The chicken and black bean sauce was good but was probably the weakest dish that we ordered from a flavor perspective. Not a spicy as they say it is. We also ordered fried Singaporean style noodles with seafood. Noodles were slightly crispy and the fish topping very tasty. Excellent place for quick, reasonable late night dinner. Decor is to be expected uninspiring and rather dated but you don't go there for the people or the atmosphere but for the food.
3 On a recent trip my boys and I had a "ChinAtkinese" diet here at Joyful House.  We ordered the salt and pepper pork chops, honey walnut shrimp, and sizzlin beef in satay sauce.   My favorite dish was the Honey Walnut Shrimp.  I was delighted to see more shrimp than almonds; however, the dish was small in size overall.  The sweetness originated from the honey (of course), a dash of sugar or brown sugar, and a hint of coconut milk.  The pepper pork chops were tender with a small spicy kick to it.  The sizzlin beef was okay.  Even though the plates were small we were actually satisfied but not totally full.    The service was Americanized compared to a typical Chinese restaurant.  Everyone working was fluent in English.  Our food was delivered fast as well.
3 Our crew needed some eats after the Hoover Dam tour so we decided to check out what Joyful House had to offer.  After looking at the expansive menu we decided on three dishes.  We ordered the salt and pepper pork chops, honey walnut shrimp, and sizzlin beef.  The honey shrimp was ok, my friend makes it better, maybe because she drizzles it with the sauce.  The same goes with the sizzlin beef, nothing to oh ah after.  This was recommended by our server.  It was tasty but nothing orgasmic.  My favorite were the chops, as they were juicy and tender!  It was seasoned and cooked perfectly for my taste buds.  Serving size were small as we ended up going to In-N-Out a few hours later.  Service was excellent and our food came out rather quick, like within 10 minutes from placing our order.
5 love it! the biggest and freshest Live Seafood Seclection. the Peking Duck was awsome. Steam Giant Oyster with Black Beans Sauce will be one of my favorite! must try!
1 This place is OK. The portions are tiny for the price and it's more Americanized than the other restaurants in town.
4 Luckily, the place is decent sized with many tables, so although it gets busy, you won't normally wait too long to be seated.   Tea is a given to be served straightaway, but water isn't. But suppose it won't kill anyone to have to ask.   We ordered: Wor Wonton Soup, Chicken Chop Suey, Honey Roasted Walnut Shrimp, Beef Chow Fun, and  Fried Flounder  Wor Wonton Soup is always good to me. Has everything I like in it from various vegetables to meat to squid. Yes.  Chicken Chop Suey was average. Not bad, but nothing special.  The Honey Roasted Walnut Shrimp never goes wrong. Ever.  I normally really like the Beef Chow Fun here, but I remember it was pretty salty this past time. They could work better on controlling their salt actually on other dishes as well.  I was a little disappointed with the Flounder. It's one of my favourite dishes, but it was my first time trying it here. Like the Chicken Chop Suey, it was good, but not as good as I had hoped.   Overall, I have eaten here a lot with my family. There are ups and downs, but nothing has happened that would stop me from coming back.
5 We came here for my grandmother's birthday dinner and this was fantastic Chinese restaurant! We ordered at least ten dishes and they were all very delicious and authentic. The only complaint I have was that the beef slices were too tough, but other than that everything else - fish, vegetables, seafood, etc - was great. They even served us complimentary dessert! I would definitely recommend this Chinese restaurant to authentic folks!
4 I came here the other night because we needed a good Chinese fix while in Vegas. Let me just say, this is one of the best Chinese seafood restaurants I've tried so far, and I've tried a lot!  I love that the tables are wide apart and not squished together. There's plenty of space to walk in and you don't have to suck yourself in to move in between seats. The decoration is not shabby, but not good. The place is very clean though.   I ordered the Sizzling Rice Soup, Tofu and Eggplant stuffed with Shrimp Paste, Fried Tofu with S/P, Honey Walnut Shrimp, and Half a Chicken W/ Ginger Sauce.  The Sizzling Rice Soup tasted of MSG, but I haven't tasted one seafood restaurant that doesn't make it taste like MSG. But the sizzling rice was greeeat, and the seafood was very, very fresh. The Tofu and Eggplant stuffed with shrimp paste was deliciouuus. I eat this all the time and this is one of the best places I have ever tasted it at. The stuffing is great, it's packed with flavor and the eggplant and tofu were soft but not falling apart. The Honey Walnut Shrimp.. Mmmm, delicious. My favorite dish there. I love that they don't go heavy on the mayonnaise and they keep the dish light and flavorful. The shrimp is super crunchy, unlike many places. The chicken was great. It was a little bit dry but I loved the flavor they got into the chicken, and that was without the ginger sauce! The Fried Tofu was good too! The skin was very thin but super crunchy and the whole tofu kind of just melts in your mouth. Although this isn't a dish, I just have to compliment it.. We asked for fresh chili and they give us chili, with soy sauce, and fried garlic. I don't know what else they put in it, but it was delicious.. Wow, so great!   Service was quick, everything was brought to us in a blink of an eye! Loved that. They were friendly and informative.   Prices are very steep here though, especially when you compare it to the portion of the dish. But the quality of the food here is superb, at least when I came. Everything was tender, fresh, juicy and delicious! I will definitely come back and try the Peking Duck.
4 Went to Joyful House with my friend on his recommendation. Found that Joyful House had a very comfortable atmosphere with a wait staff that was friendly and always waiting our request. We had ordered the Black Sea Bass, fried noodles, Honey Walnut Shrimp on a previous Yelp recommendation and Chicken in Black Bean Sauce. Honey Walnut Shrimp was quite honestly the best I've ever had. Fried Noodles were very good and the Black Sea Bass was good too. I've had better Sea Bass, but it was good. I just prefer my Sea Bass too be a slight bit on the sweet side in the preparation. The Chicken in Black Bean Sauce was tasty too. But back to the Honey Walnut Shrimp, that dish was the highlight of the night! Very happy and will return to Joyful House in the future!
5 My friends and I were craving for good authentic Chinese foods after few days of American foods around Vegas areas. I mean real Chinese foods. So I decide to search the Yelp and find Joyful House Chinese restaurant. Am I lucky? The food and service are excellent and no doubt to recommend this place.  My friends and I ordered a steam red big eye fish. The fish is made just right. If you know how to make a traditional Chinese steam fish, you know it is important to have good quality of fish, have to be fresh, and also the timing to steam the fish has to be just right, not too long or too short. We also have the coral shrimp, those shrimps are fresh and  tastes sweet. We also tried the lobster as well - I mean those over 4 lbs lobster. The lobster meat is fresh and tastes very good, can't get it from somewhere else.   Another dish that we ordered is black bean sauce clams, it is amazingly good. They are juicy, tender and "big" as a clam. I never taste such a clam before. As Chinese, we got to order a dish of vegetable - garlic baby bean sprout (the leafy ones.)  As far as the space, as other described, they are spacious and sit comfortably for a big group. Very clean place. Decoration is ok.  The service is excellent. The waiter and waitress all are friendly and answer all our questions. The food is served promptly. They even serve complimentary dessert as well.  If you are looking for Chinese foods and wants to get away from the Stripe. I would highly recommend this restaurant.
2 Tried this place because of Yelp reviews. Totally disappointed. Other than the service - nothing else. No flavor at all! Those reviewers never had good Chinese cooking.
3 I tried Joyful House today with a friend because another friend has always told us that it is delicious.  It was pretty good.  We had the Steamed Tofu in Seared Soy Sauce and the Marinated Pork Chops.  The Steamed Tofu was just alright.  The tofu kind of lacked flavor.  The Marinated Pork Chops were really good though.  It was not amazing, but it was pretty good.    I definitely will be checking this place out again to try other things.  They do have a happy hour from 11 am - 5 pm, and 10pm-3 am.  It is a little pricey.  The service was pretty good as the waiters were pretty attentive.
4 Staff was attentive. I can't judge too much yet on the first visit so I'll have to update this later. The first thing I noticed when coming in was that this is one of those restaurants that big Chinese families go to to have their huge family dinners. Just wanted to throw that out there.  Got the mandarin pork chops and steamed tofu. Won't be getting those again just cause it's not really my thing. But I can hardly use that to judge the restaurant overall.  I will definitely be back during happy hour to try the many other dishes :).  They've all been so nice so far.
4 Good Chinese seafood place in Vegas Chinatown that's open until 3am.  They have a late happy hour menu too, as well as a regular happy hour menu so it's a perfect place to go after late drinking or gambling.  The first thing you notice is the huge banner they have that says it's been named one of the top 50 restaurants in the US by CNN, which is pretty impressive actually.  Food is really good, I've ordered the Maine Lobster cooked Chinese style with ginger and onions, about $20 per pound (advertised half off) which was about 3 1/2 pounds.  Very tasty with the shell pre-cut so it was easy to get to the lobster meat.  I also had the clay pot clams with pork dish, which was about 95% clams and onions but very little pork.  Overall very good and I'd come back again. One thing, if you come after 2:30 am they won't let you sit so you have to get takeout.  Service is good and attentive too, which can be unusual in a Chinese restaurant.
4 We go to the Joyful House every time we are in Las Vegas. The prawns in spicy sweet and sour sauce are awesome! our grandsons love it too!
3 We went here from reading good yelp reviews.  I wasn't very impressed.  We went late at night so I don't know if that had anything to do with it but the flavors were just not there.  Very bland.
4 Joyful to eat here!  We had our mouth watering for the lobster with ginger & scallions but was told that they only had 5lb lobsters left, way too much for just two people dining. Well maybe we could have finished it (not)!  LOL So we ordered the seafood claypot, combo H.K. Style pan fried noodles, and the garlic spinach.  Food was delicious will definitely come back when in Vegas.
4 This is one of the best Chinese restaurants in town. they are open pretty much all the time (I believe they close at 2am)  there stuff is always very friendly and on top of everything - well not literary :) - I would recommend their crispy noodles, Mongolian beef , fried rice... well everything is great. If you are going with a group their family menu offers you a lot of food for a good price- I would say 2 orders would feed 3 people easily.
4 Never thought I'd find a Chinese restuarant that is open until 3:00am. But then again we are in Vegas.  After some gambling and a bit of drinking, the wife and I were craving some off the strip, more afordable Chinese food (yes I lost some dough at the tables that night). We enter here at about 12:30 am and obviously it is totally empty besides 1 other client. We are seated and start looking through the menu.   The restaurant itself is pretty big. It has a lively atmosphere with 1 flatscreen TV. They have a decent selection of beer which was cool. We end up ordering the basics wich were Honey Walnut Prawns, Pan Fried Noodles with beef, and fried rice. Huge portions which was prefect since I was starving.  Eveything tasted great. No complaints from us whatsoever. No we were not drunk, so our taste buds were definitely not decieving us. The walnut prawns were addicting, and had to have a fork fight with the wife to grab the last one. She won.  Our waiter was great the entire time. Wich of course he should, being as it was empty.  I would love to comeback and try some of the other dishes.  So if your having a late night craving, or just a craving for for Chinese grub in general, don' hesitate to stop by this place.
4 Really good chinese. Fried rice was good. The duck was good and very meaty, not overly greasy. Good service. Good Chinese restaurant atmosphere.
1 Ordered 2 items: - half roast duck - clay pot sea bass with tofu  Flavor of food is just OK.  Not spectacular. However service this evening was horrible.  We waited more than 30 min, before the waitress realized that we haven't got our food yet.  She actually may not have realized it if the busboy had not pointed it out to her.  Then she rushed in to the kitchen to check on our order and pushed our order.  The roast duck with rice came frst.  It's another 15 min +before the fish came.  So for sure will not come back to this place anymore ...
4 I love Chinese food and I heard that this restaurant serves good food. The place was clean and the server was friendly and attentive. I enjoyed their food and all I can say is their honey walnut shrimp, beef crispy noodles, beef and chinese brocolli was great but I didn't think their fried rice was that great. Their menus are kinda expensive but I just want to try it. Well see If I will come back to this place again...
5 There is a reason why they have award banners hanging outside.  It is just simply delicious.  Growing up our family went to Sam Woo BBQ all the time.  As I got older and busier I discovered this place.  WOW. It's great.  My friends and I come here and order a dish each and we share. This is a typical family style Chinese Restaurant.  I love everything that my friends and I have ever ordered here.    The reason I gave it 5 stars is because they have good service and it's clean but still have that legitimate Chinese food.  I have never waited to get a table.  I recommend Salt and Pepper anything: from Pork Chops to Tofu, its all good.
4 Ate here once and I was instantly impressed with the atmosphere. The place is very clean. The staff was friendly, prompt and attentive. I had the General Tso's a.k.a Cho  Chicken. It was a portion for 2 but it made dinner for the next night easy. They could have eased up on the sauce a tiny bit (it was caked in it). The Won Soup was awesome. Overall, I will definitely eat here again but I will be trying something else to expand my horizons. BTW this place has a MASSIVE seafood menu for all you seafood eaters.
5 Delicious! We decided to go outside our comfort zone and got a chicken and Chinese sausage clay pot and it was to die for. We also got pan fried soy sauce noodles which were great and the Mongolian beef which was so-so but that's what I get for ordering a standard. Appetizers included moo shu pork (yum!) and hot and sour soup which was delish. Great service. Clean. Ill be back.
5 After eating here, I can understand why it's won so many local best Chinese restaurant awards.   The high quality shows in everything I had, from the iced cappuccino, to appetizers, to the entrees. The sizzling beef was tender.  The lemon chicken was excellent.  The chow mein was top notch, and that iced cappuccino had a very robust coffee flavor.  All of the food had very well balanced flavor, and was not overly salty. This is the kind of place that's a quick drive from the strip, and I would be proud to take out of town visitors to. Service was very attentive, and I look forward to coming back to Joyful House!
1 We went for Christmas eve dinner ( as Jews often do!) looking for a straight forward chinese food meal. Ordered standard fare, pot stickers, wonton soup, egg foo young, mongolian beef... the worst, brown gravy, cornstarchy, old oil tasting, salty, gooy , single note tasting chinese food I have had in years... if this wins all these banners for the best in las  vegas, they must have fed the LVRJ for free for years. Yuck!
1 If you go to a Chinese restaurant to eat make sure you see at least 10 Chinese people eating not standing around watching TV.  If you don't see them run. One of Funniest things I ever heard in my life the owner or maybe not was talking to a couple next to our table saying I require my staff to speak English. Really?  I asked for a jack and coke what came to the table was regular coke. I asked the server what's up? He said we don't have that. I said take the coke away he gave to the couple sitting next to us.  Joyful house! Our shrimp in lobster sauce came out with canned mushrooms strange.  My wife Asian was laughing. She said check out your fork I think they used that one to fix the drain in the kitchen seems the forks and spoons have been there sense 1980's it wouldn't be so bad if the food was really fantastic. Costco has GREAT deals on quality table wear on MLK (TIP OF THE DAY) I asked the server what is in the dumplings he said chicken. I asked if they had shrimp of pork dumpling he said you can go up the street if you want that. OMG! I said we will try the dumplings how many do you get ?  He said 5 - I said r u sure the menu says 6. He said 5 only. Ok served 6.  Keep in mind we went in early before 5pm to check this place out. I was here 12 yrs ago and it was pretty good. How many signs do you need that say vote #1 in the 2011 RJ readers poll inside your restaurant? I think I counted 6 big ones and a CNN international one blocking the front door.  Don't believe everything u read. It's  Dec21st we are all still alive and the food is below average. RJ readers poll is rigged.  Look I have been to Asian restaurants around the world this place is NOT in the top 100.  Maybe the real employee's are on vacation?  Hmmmmm...
5 Finally a Chinese restaurant that is worth revisiting. Thanks Yelpers for the reviews on this one, most of you were spot on for this place. We kept it simple this visit to feel the place out. -sweet and sour pork- perfect balance of flavors. The pork was not over coated and had a nice crisp -Singapore noodles- thin rice noodles with a pleasant spice. Some shrimp, pork, beef with some veggies including Jalapeño. Very tasty - pork fried rice- another excellent dish.   Everything is family style so this is a great place for groups. There were only 2 of us so plenty of left overs. Definitely a return trip
4 Great service. The food was decent. But kinda expensive.
4 Ordered the roast duck from their lunch special (which included egg roll appetizer, corn soup, pork fried rice and soda) plus their combination pan fried noodles. The 2 dishes were not too shabby but I would say that I've had better. This restaurant is nice and clean inside so if you have guests from out of town or business lunch of some sort, this place will do.The service was surprisingly good. I'm asian so I know that asian restaurants care more about how good their food is than service but this one actually surprised me on the good side.
2 Apparently quality Chinese seafood restaurants are not that easy to find in Vegas.  Went two days in a row and had the live Dungeness crab both times.  Second time was particularly disappointing, with the crab meat having no texture and the garlic pork scallion sauce burnt to the point of excessive bitterness (and no ! it was not the 2.75 lbs they charged for); the fried squid appetizer was tough and tasteless as well. The service was non existent and for dessert they actually served rotten watermelon -- they must be clueless.  The first occasion was better, but after going back its clear this place really doesn't care.
5 Always great Chinese food and excellent service. Let me be more specific...   The shrimp wonton soup has great hong kong style flavor, the noodles are al dente, and the wontons are shrimpy and delicious. The server comes to the table to serve and portion the noodles and wonton for each person on the table (they keep it fair whenever possible).   On another occasion, I came in with my mom and she noted how good and flavorful the white rice was. I don't really eat white rice much, but apparently it's a big deal to traditional Chinese folk. I think they think if the restaurant can't get the rice right, then what does that say about the rest of their food.   Since moving out here, I miss my mom's soups/elixers and to get a taste of home, I like to order their house soup. This is on the menu but it's usually some traditional soup that Chinese families cook at home. Nothing like Egg drop, Westlake or Hot and Sour soup. It's usually a combination of chicken and pork broth based with herbs and vegetables. Generally it's good for your body or health, but it depends on which soup.   It is a little pricier than some of the more casual Chines restaurants but it shows in the quality of ingredients.
4 Excellent Chinese food at decent prices.  I have come here a few times in the past years, but since I haven't been recently, I wanted to wait to review it with a fresh mind.  I think the average entree was about $10-11, with large sharing portions.  Everything was cooked well and it's one of the better Chinese restaurants in town IMO.  Here is a pic of everything we ordered :  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joyful-house-chinese-cuisine-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#GAN-B1GGaFvLw0tAS5zyuQ  We tried their salt and pepper shrimp (shells), which were cooked perfectly and had a great flavor.  One of the better ways I've had it.  Tried the salt and pepper pork since everyone was saying great things about it....it was also very good!  Nice crispy pieces of pork with a light breading around it.  It had lots of flavor and a little spice to back it up.  The half duck was good and flavorful.  I haven't had duck for a little while, so it really hit the spot.  We tried the garlic eggplant, which was good, but a little mushy for me.  The flavor was there, just not my favorite way to eat eggplant.  They are open very late, 3am every night, so this will really hit the spot for late night cravings!
4 This is definitely my go-to Chinese restaurant in town because it's family-style dining and they serve my favorite dishes. We're usually here with my parents because they love it as well and luckily, my mom has cravings often enough for me to have my fill. We normally order the same dishes when it's the four of us (my parents, Ruben, and myself): Salt & Pepper Calamari (BEST place to order it!), Chicken Chow Fun in Black Bean Sauce (not always consistently delicious, but I love these wide, flat, chewy noodles), Kung Pao Shrimp (my mom's favorite dish; I love picking out the peanuts hehe), Combination Fried Rice (I'm not a fan of their fried rice, but everyone else enjoys it), Chinese Broccoli, and Mapu Tofu (this time I ordered it without meat and it was still good). What a great meal. Honestly, I could come here for JUST the calamari. Very good.  Even with the mostly "just okay" service, the food keeps bringing us back. I also appreciate the generous pot of Jasmine rice and the fantastic prices!
4 This was a great experiance for sure. The dinner for two for $15.50 a person is well worth the money.  Great service, Great food, and a great atmospher.
3 Do you ever wake up in the middle of the night craving sweet and sour chicken? Well do I have a place for you! Yep, even at 2am you can get Chinese food in Vegas. We ordered a shit ton of food for only 4 of us so Ill just laundry list each item with a few thoughts.   Wonton Soup (Cantonese style).. kind of blah and bland. I'd opt for the hot and sour instead which was exactly as its named. Perfect.   Rosy Duck, crisp, duck fatty.. Came with plum sauce which tasted like industrial cleaner.  Salt and Pepper Pork Chop, bone-in thin pork chops deep friend and covered with fried garlic and chilies. This was a hit!  Boiled Chicken with Chives, pretty bland and the garlic ginger sauce was too oily masking most of the flavor.  Combination Pan Fried Noodles, generously covered with shrimp, beef and chicken the dish over all was super goopey and not very appetizing. Opt for Lo Mein next time.  Beef Chow Fun with black bean sauce was good. The beef was silky and tender while the noodles chewy and oily. This was another hit!  Service was pretty amazing (fast, efficient), well priced and portion sizes were huge. They also have a humongous menu plus fresh seafood on premises. For late night eats their selection is hard to beat!
5 Great food, great ambiance, even better service.  Food: Sea Bass with Black Bean Sauce: The fish is perfectly cooked, melts in your mouth and the saltiness of the blackbean sauce was not overwhelming. It was perfect. Filet Mignon with Portabella Mushroom: THE BEEF!!!! so tender... the sauce was not overbearing and filet went very well with the mushroom. Eggplant and Tofu Hotpot: Tofu is FRIED! scorching hot eggplant and tofu swimming in savory sauce.. heavenly. Steamed Chicken in Ginger and Scallion Sauce: Reminded me of Hainan chicken without the garlic rice but with chinese greens.   The staff were attentive from the moment we sat down, and the lemon iced tea they recommended was so refreshing. I will definitely be back!
5 Yummy Food!!!! I would def go back!!!!
4 You know you're friends with real Asian people when Day 2 of the trip... you're all craving rice!   We came in here before closing time... and thankfully they were able to accommodate our big group... I ended up just letting the ladies order... our side were mostly veggie oriented while the other table went meat crazy.  Friendly service... good tasty veggie food... price was decent as well.  My apologies that I can't say much... I was so out of it while eating... my mission was just to chew and swallow. Yep, I was that tired! Nonetheless, the ladies of the group all enjoyed this dinner so I'll definitely check it out again next time around.
4 This is probably the best Chinese restaurant in town. Highly recommended.
4 Yum! I'm not a huge lover of true Asian food - for example, my favorite Chinese food is served at Panda Express. Despite my best intentions, I typically balk at the stuff people actually eat in places like Vietnam and Taiwan. You can understand why I was a little leery of venturing to a Chinese place on Spring Mountain for dinner with my coworkers the other night, especially when it was recommended by the Taiwanese guy! I consulted with him and he assured me that 'americans' like myself would still be able to find something to eat at Joyful House, so we decided to check it out.   The restaurant is quite large and well-lit, with a bunch of (like 15) tanks for fresh seafood that you can see. It seemed like a pretty legit operation and my coworker was already conversing in mandarin (or something) with the friendly wait staff, so we knew we'd be treated to a wide variety of dishes.  Speaking of wide variety, everybody ordered a bunch of stuff and then my coworker spoke to the waiter and apparently ordered like 6 more dishes. Everything is family style, so we had waaaayyyy too much food, even for our large group of like 12. Here's a quick run down:  Garlic Baby Bok-Choy - loved it. Not bland like your usual veggie dishes. Highly recommend. Mandarin pork chop - the favorite of several people at the table. Sweet and breaded, which is my fave. Sizzling steak - just ok. We were pretty pumped after the sizzling presentation, but it wasn't anything special. Not spicy (despite the warning on the menu). Clay pot scallops - served with rice noodles and really good. Seafood dish - don't know what it was called, but I really liked it. It came with shrimp, crispy noodles, and some other stuff I can't remember. My 2nd fave. Clay pot eggplant - good not great. Pork fried rice - standard. String beans with pork - good not great. Appetizer soup - just the soup they serve to everybody, I guess - beef broth with nothing in it. It was as good as you can make beef broth, but the 1 year old LOVED it, so bonus for that. Tapioca Dessert Soup - no thank you. If you're into tapioca, you might like it. Lemon iced tea - really good! Sweetened, but not too sweet. I actually had two glasses, which I usually don't do.   Prices were kinda high - $15-20/meat dish, but everything was good, including the service.   Any time I have somebody in town craving a 'fancier' Chinese meal, we will definitely take them to Joyful House.   Bonus points for being open late (til like 3am)!
2 Unfortunately Yelp REALLY  let me down w/ this restaurant.  We had the seafood family dinner.  Seafood was fair, but not plentiful - more vegetables than anything else, and an overabundance of celery which we don't even like. :-(   Chow mein and fried rice were the greasiest, most unappetizing I have ever had.  Since I tend to lean toward eating healthier fare, I had wicked heartburn 10 min after leaving! UGH!!!  :-(.  If this is the best Chinese in LV, I feel sorry for the locals!
3 I went here on the recommendation of a friend in the restaurant industry...doubtful I would have ever found the place w/o that.  The facility is clean and bright with lots of seafood tanks for selecting fresh seafood.  The staff was friendly, efficient, and helpful.  For starters I had the Rosy Duck. The meat was tender and flavorful, and the skin was delightfully crisp. The plum sauce was pretty bad...another reviewer described it as "industrial cleaner"...which I'm sympathetic to. I'd definitely order this again...but will steer clear of the plum sauce.   For mains, I had the "Salt and Pepper Pork Chops" which many reviewers raved about. The batter and spicing/seasoning of the pork was very well done. Quite crisp and a good balance of salt/heat/batter/fat. The pork itself was quite disappointing though...very stringy, low-quality cut of pork. I would have MUCH rather had 1/2 or even 1/4 of the quantity for a better quality of pork.  For dessert I had the chocolate Mochi Ice Cream. It was served far too cold. The ice cream was actually chewy....more than a little. If served a bit warmer, it would have been good i think...the chocolate flavor was decent, the pastry wrapper was nicely done...just the temp.  I think maybe I didn't order the dishes these guys do best...next time I'm going to have to try the fresh seafood. Also, the prices were quite reasonable. Appetizer, entree, dessert, and hot tea for $26 in Vegas..that's a pretty good deal.
4 After moving from the Rowland Heights area to Vegas, I was desperately in need of some yummy Chinese food.  The local Chinese restaurants in my neighborhood are awful!!!  Thank goodness I found this place.  I ordered the roast duck, Chinese broccoli, mandarin style pork chops, and salt & pepper shrimp.  The salt & pepper shrimp was awesome.  Probably one of the best shrimp dishes I've had.  The rest was ok.  It wasn't nearly as good as the Asian cuisine found back in Cali, but the best in Vegas so far.  I will gladly drive the half hour to eat there.  I took off one star because of the price.Thanks yelpers for this find.  :)
5 Will always be my favorite Chinese restaurant in Vegas. The portions are giant. This is always my family's go-to place for get togethers or just to have family dinners. Nothing but good memories at this place every visit. My favorite's are the salt and pepper calamari and combination fried rice. I could eat that fried rice for a week straight without getting sick of it.
5 Wonderful find and I am going again soon.  If you are tired of Vegas Strip food, then go to China Town.
5 My wife and I are new in town and use Yelp as well as some friends input when looking for a particular kind of food. Such was the case in finding Joyful House. We arrived around 5:30 or so and were seated immediately.  Our server came over within 2-3 minutes to ask what we would like to drink and if we wanted water. The drinks and water were returned almost immediately as well as a hot pot of delicious tea. Our waiter was very helpful in choosing our dishes. However, the portions are way too large to be shared by just two people and should be considered food for four, especially is you plan on trying several dishes. We started with pot stickers and they were simply outstanding. We did not realize the dinner was served with a large bowl of steamed rice and ordered combination fried rice, which was excellent, but not necessary. Based on another review we tried the Walnut Prawns which were simply outstanding. We also had Sweet and Sour Pork as out second dish. Way too much food for two people so guess what we are having for lunch today. Next time we will wither go with four people or order a little less food. Initially, prices seemed high, but when we saw the amount of food it was well worth the price. We have started a folder of restaurants we have enjoyed and keep a copy of the menu in there for future reference. Needless to say Joyful House menu has been added. This is definitely a keeper!
4 Our foray into Chinatown - unbelievably the first in our 9-year history in Las Vegas - started out a bit rocky, but was quickly transformed into a wonderful dining experience.  After the initial kinks were knocked out, the food won out, as did some hands-on attention by Gary, the manager/(owner?).  I can understand why the guy sitting next to me on the plane last week heartily recommended Joyful House.  We started with Hot and Sour soup, at first dismayed by the price, but after hubby had four bowls (to my 2 1/2), the quantity and quality made up for it:  it's gotta be the best Hot and Sour in the Valley!  We shared a Chicken & Portobello Mushroom, also delicious, and also a String Bean with Minced Pork that would have been fabulous if I had only remembered to ask for "no extra salt."  Gary offered to remake the dish, but we kept it, since it was really good despite my anti-salt crusade.    For us, the hallmark of a good restaurant is being made to feel welcomed and appreciated.  If not, it doesn't matter how good the food is.  Joyful House wins on both counts, and we look forward to returning soon.
5 Joyful House has the best Chinese food. We ventured off of the strip and into Chinatown and loved all of the menu options -- of which there are many. Anything you order is going to be amazing. They have shark fin options on the menu though, eek.   We had hot and sour soup, completely delicious. At the server's rec, we ordered the pan fried sea bass and sweet and sour scallops. We also had crispy noodles with vegetables, seafood and chicken (I can't remember the name of the dish).   The manager came and chatted with us for a bit, too. The service was excellent and the food was even better. We are definitely coming back next time we are in Vegas.
3 Been here a couple times but last week was the first in awhile. Figured it was time to write a review on this place now having visited it once again. My mom loves this place. For this latest visit, it was a family affair. I don't know how weird this sounds. For I, upon walking into Joyful House, the ambiance feels like how I'm used to a chinese restaurant feeling like. I will admit the food is slightly pricier here. To be fair, the food is, for the most part, decent to very good. They do serve complimentary jasmine rice, which not every place would have. Jasmine is very fragrant and less starchy than say, a long grain calrose. It does cost more and better, at least I think so. Along with complimentary hot tea. Even though most chinese restaurants serve these 2 items complimentary, it is worth mentioning since I am aware some places charge for them. Service overall has been ok. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. There seems to be a lag sometimes when it gets real busy to get something or having water or hot tea refilled. And believe me, this place does get busy! I give Joyful House a solid 3.5 stars.
4 After finish our hike from bottom of grand canyon to the south rim and the 5 hrs drive to las vegas, we were ravenous. 8 hungry asians quickly ordered and the first combo appetizer plate was cleared within 2 minutes. The cold combination plate had some hot items which was a bit odd but everything was delicious. Jelly fish strips were flavorful, the duck was not as juicy as I would like, but I was happy. Ham was yummy and the braised beef slices were ok.    Then we had some stir fried greens (well cooked but pretty expected), the seafood claypot had a lot of seafood (shrimp, scallops, squid, etc), fish sauce eggplant clay pot had a lot of sauce that went well with rice. Beef chow fun was quite good and I don't normally like that stuff. the pepper and salt pork chops was good but had a lot breading. but i loved it regardless. we got another tofu dish with mushroom.. it was nice and light (be careful though - it burned the roof of my mouth).  Last dish we had was some kind of beef in sweet sauce which i didn't try.    At the end of the meal, they brought us slices of watermelon and one in the group spoke cantonese so she got us an overflowing plate of watermelon --- on the house!  They even told her that if we ran out, we can ask for more. :)  yayyy for free watermelon.   We were quite loud/excited after being starved for a week from camping and road tripping in the wilderness, but they were completely fine and service was good.
3 This is my mom and dad's favorite Chinese restaurant. The mixed fried rice is great, the chicken (any recipe really) is awesome and I absolutely love the soup.  The only problem I have for this place is that the servers can be a little pushy sometimes. Not every time, but the second to last time I went there, the dude was slightly rude...and there was like 5 other partys, with like 5 other servers...CALM DOWN.
5 Don't listen to the naysayers.  This place is as good as any A-List Chinese restaurant in greater Los Angeles.   Food was top rated. Service was superb. Atmosphere much better than average Chinese deco. NOT expensive. Go without fear
4 Nice clean Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. Large menu and entrees come in pretty large portions. My friend and I had the marinated fried chicken and beef chow fun and they were so tasty we finished all of our food. They don't charge for rice and tea either unlike some of the cheapo restaurants here in town. Most things on the menu are about the same price $9.95-11.95 is average for this place I'd say. But for the portions I don't think it's too bad. It was also quiet because it didn't get too packed while we were there. The employees are very friendly and food seems to come out fairly quickly. I look forward to coming back here in the future to try other dishes
4 Best Chinese food I had in Vegas so far. Would rather go here than the expensive restaurants in the Vegas strip. And staff was very helpful!
3 I went to this place on a recommendation, we are from Green Valley and have struggled to find a chinese place we like.  The food was pretty good and portion sizes were huge.  I only gave it 3 stars because of the service.  Our waitress never came to check on us.  We would have to ask random employees for more water, salt & pepper (they were not on any table) and sugar for the tea.  When we requested sugar, the lady kind of scoffed at us.  They took our food away to put it in to-go containers, which I really don't feel comfortable with.  Then they refused to give us the steamed rice in our to-go container; however, they came and swooped it off the table.  Leading me to wonder where is that rice going?  I would probably eat here again, but it did not end my quest for the best chinese place in Vegas.
4 OUTSTANDING seafood.  "That was really good.  What was it?" asks my Midwest white friend  "Spicy jellyfish with bean curd" is my straight face response.  "Huh?  So what is this?" he stupidly continues.  "Um, sea cucumber with abalone"; again straight faced.  "What?!?" With great exasperation in his voice.  "And this is Santa Barbra Spot Prawns with their egg clutch, deep fried crab with fermented black beans, steamed live fish with ginger onion, and the soup was made from tiger shark fin".  "I think I'm going to be sick" is all he can say.  Sorry I can't help but to explode in laughter.  Joyful House is a Cantonese seafood restaurant for the initiated.  I'm not sure if I should even write this review.  It's one of those places that long time Asian Vegas locals cherish.  Yes its won the "Best of Vegas" from the Review Journal but that barely speaks to it's hidden greatness.  So maybe they need to get to know you before they reveal their secrets, persist.  For example, you MUST ask for their spot prawns with the eggs.  Yes, they are now $12 each but they are worth every penny.  Eggs exploding in your mouth with the essence of fresh shrimp.  The spicy jellyfish was excellent.  Clean oceanic flavor accented by sesame and chili oil, and a touch of soy.  The sea cucumber with abalone, a tender sweet explosion of sea flavor.  Don't hate me but this is one of the few places that still uses real shark fin.  While I deplore fining and think it's inhumane, I couldn't resist.  It's been 12 years since I had the real thing.  Add a jigger of Remy XO, perfect.  This is not your typical Cantonese restaurant.  Yes, if you choose, they make great Americanized favorites (beef broccoli. shrimp fried rice, "Peeking duck", lemon chicken, shrimp with honey walnuts) but ultimately only those in the know will experience it's greatness.  Shhhhh.  Not for everyone.
5 My husband and I were at a loss as to what to have for dinner this evening. So we both hopped on yelp and found THIS restaurant. Upon walking in I noticed how clean everything was, and I liked the way the tables were set up. We first ordered egg drop soup with mushrooms, I can honestly say that it was the best egg drop soup I've had in a very long time. It was perfectly seasoned, perfect consistency. Only SMALL issue I had, was I wished there was more egg, other than that it was absolutely delicious. I ordered sweet and sour pork and my husband ordered sautéed chicken with Portobello mushrooms in a black pepper sauce. The sweet and sour pork was fairly generic, but it was awesome. The pork was still crunchy even with the sauce on top, the onions and bell peppers were sautéed to perfection. An absolute great dish. My husbands chicken dish was off the chain, the mushrooms were in big chunks so you REALLY got a good taste of them, the chicken was tender and flavorful and the pepper sauce was perfect. I expected the pepper sauce to be too spicy (I don't handle spice very well) but it was great! It had a good pepper flavor, but it wasn't over powering or too spicy. A freaking epic dish. The service, for a Chinese restaurant, was actually really good. Our waiters were very attentive. I would totally recommend this place, great food and great service. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!!!
3 Got to try this place finally for the first time. Heard good things abut them so coming here was a no brainer.  I gotta give them props for their menu. It looks like they put a lot of thought and detail into it. For example, if you were craving a certain item like soup, bam! All the soups they have are all in one section. This applies to all others like noodles, seafood, etc. We ordered Salt n Pepper Calamari, Salt n Pepper Porkchops, and Honey Walnut Shrimp.   The Honey Walnut Shrimp was decent, but to me it seemed to lack a bit of sauce to it. When we got the plate, it already looked like somebody ate some shrimp off of it. If you refer to my picture, you can see that they don't give you much shrimp to begin with. The best Honey Walnut Shrimp I ever had was at Panda Inn in the city of La Palma, Ca.   Both the Salt n Pepper Porkchops and Salt n Pepper Calamari was very good. The only thing lacking I thought was some kind of sauce to dip it in. There was soy sauce on the table but that will only add to the saltiness of the two entrees. I was thinking sweet n sour sauce would be perfect to dip it in.   Service was very good. They took our order and processed it right away. We got our food in no time. Refills were constant and im glad because of the salt content we ordered which was good with the steamed rice we ate it with.  The main negative thing that stood out for me was the prices. With all the three items we ordered plus tax it came out to 41 dollars and that's without any drinks (we had water which was good because it was filtered and not tap water). I thought the food was good but 15 bucks a pop for the Honey Walnut Shrimp and the Salt n Pepper Porkchops is bit much. Even the appetizer Salt n Pepper Calamari was 8.99.   All in all I thought it was an ok experience based off of the negatives and positives that balanced each other out. All I know is be prepared to spend a lot of money if you are paying for a party of 4 or more.  P.S. They don't give out fortune cookies when you get your check and its a 20 dollar minimum to use debit/credit.
5 We got "Family Dinner B".   It was quite possibly the tastiest Chinese food  I have ever had.  I'm pretty sure there is some MSG in there. But, really, what is chinese food sans MSG?
4 A Very Solid Above Average Chinese Restaurant for Sure!  I wish I had more time in town to try the Abalone or Geoduck , Braised Tofu with Bamboo Fungus and bunches of other things I never had before.  I tried the vegetable rolls and being honest they were very average but we wanted something vegetable with the dish we shared.  I was very impressed with the Crispy Fried Whole Fish (Flounder) with Spicy Tofu and Beef. The sauce it was in just hits all the right places in your mouth. You get a slight amount of sweet and you also get a little sour from a pickled vegetable. You get SPICE I'd say about a 6.5 on a Thai Food Scale and you get deliciousness from garlic ginger and other ingredients. The beef just adds a little body to the sauce. The fish was very sweet and fresh tasting and very moist. It's very large and enough for two people to share at lunch time but for dinner I think one person can handle it because the fish is very flat so it's not as much food as it looks. They use plain silken tofu with the dish and it's just in the sauce on top of the fish. It's a little difficult to eat with the one fork but it really is extremely tasty and worth it.  They feature dishes made with a variety of live fish from tanks.  Joyful House Chinese Makes Joyful Meals!  A new favorite  4.5 stars
4 Service is always good. Get the following:  1. Peking the duck 2. Honey, you like walnut shrimp? 3. Garrick n peppa powkchop   ... Portions are huge so bring your friends and your fam.. & me! But you're treatin!   Why 5th star? Cause they don't have sriracha! I mean, c'mon, isn't sriracha Chinese hot sauce?
4 The salt and pepper shrimp was fantastic. I didn't have the opportunity to try the calamari but if its anything like the shrimp, it's probably just as fantastic. My husband had the chicken chow fun with black bean sauce and that was ok. He said he would not order it again because it lacked the smoky flavor that other Chinese restaurants have in their chow fun. The Chinese broccoli was a little aged so some of it was stringy and towards the end there were a few pieces that were gritty.  I would definitely come back here for the salt and pepper anything.
5 We have dinner here all the time and love eating here. The food is usually great, and if there are problems they are very efficient on fixing the dish. I would suggest the seafood chow fun with black bean sauce.
5 The best tea in the world!
2 Attentive, Clean, friendly, decently priced and accurate with our order. Nice atmosphere.  Unfortunately I Wasn't impressed with the food. The salty pepper pork chops were not as crispy as I would like them to be and the flavoring a were all toppings not cooking into the batter.   The seafood sizzling soup was awful. No flavor in the soup. No sizzle in the block of rice the put in before it actually got to the table. There was mushy fish and a few tiny tiny shrimp with no flavor either.  I thought I would try it because it had good ratings but maybe what I ordered wasn't the favorites of my fellow yelpers.
5 This place is not be well-rounded when it comes to food, but I still like it. Their service is always friendly and attentive. The restaurant is also clean. It's hard to find those in a Chinese restaurant.   My favorite is the Mongolian beef. The meat is very, very tender. The plate is colorful. It looks like it came out of a Samsung TV. I usually like my Mongolian beef spicier, but theirs has lots of flavor so it's fine. The portions are just right too, for the price. Their rice is always free so you have to take that into account if you think they're too expensive. Then there's the lemon chicken. It's very crunchy, and the sauce is not as tiring. It's not made up of mushed up meat so it's real chicken.   I can't say everything in their menu is great, but they always get my favorites on point. You really have to come here for those specific dish they get right. Overall the experience I get is always awesome here. They're open late. Love that.
5 Excellent - family owned, Gary treated us as family. All the food we ordered was great, but the clams in black bean with ginger was to die for. Definitely going to come back! Also had the seafood clay pot and wonton soup with noodles both were recommendable - a must try place!!
5 Overall the ambience is very nice (I may feel uncomfortable wearing a t-shirt.)  Our group of 4 took some time to figure out what we wanted since the menu is extensive. You can get a dinner for around $10 if you a stick with a noodle dish or simpler stir fry or clay pot. You can also splurge on a Peking duck or their market price seafood up to $70/lb. I chose to go a little less expensive tonight.    The eggplant tofu clay pot was delicious! It has a strange shrimp pate in the middle of the eggplant which was unnerving at first but I loved it.  The waiter was extremely helpful and nice.  On a Friday night at 630pm our food took only 10 minutes!  I would definitely recommend and will return!
3 Received a recommendation to restaurant. Ventured off the strip to have lunch. Ordered the salt and pepper prawns, garlic bok choy, and hot and spicy soup. Food was yummy and portions was good size. Would recommend if you're looking for Chinese food.
5 We went the three of us and each of us ordered different appetizers, entrees and desserts. EVERY dish was superb. Give this restaurant six stars, five stars are not enough.
4 Stumbled onto another Chinese place in Vegas, we wanted to try many things they have to offer, but we arrived late night.  The ambience was clean and classy like a traditional place.  They have enough for mid-size parties.  They did not seem to have any Late Night specials, just the regular menu.  We got some bean sauce oysters, the flavors were good and oysters were fresh.  BBQ Platter was ok probably due to being late at night, they got the essential components, the meats were reheated, but the cold dishes in the center tasted good.  The House Pan Fried Noodles was good.  Joyful House provided a somewhat joyful experience for us late at night, although not everything was perfect, but the place seems promising.  The AYCE Chinese hotpot sounds exciting, so until next time.
5 Came here for a wedding reception. DELICIOUS. Really indulged here. Had all kinds of good food. Peking duck, walnut shrimp, delicious spring rolls, delicious fish. The fish was to die for, you better bet I tore that shit apart.  Too bad I live in San Diego or I would come here more often.
4 Since my wife and I moved to Las Vegas (this year), we have been looking for Chinese delivery as good as what we were used to getting in Los Angeles.  Joyful House the best we have found yet.  It is not delivery, but the takeout service was quick and attentive.  Appetizers - the Crab Rangoon and Potstickers were good.  The Crispy Fried Prawns were a bit thick on the breading, but the prawns themselves were flavorful.  Main dishes - The Beef Tenderloin Mignon With Onion really was filet mignon, so far as I could tell.  Very tender and flavorful, and they didn't skimp on the beef.  The Sweet and Sour Pork was also flavorful, with only a hint of toughness; and the sauce did not drown out the flavor of the pork.  The soft Pan Fried Noodles With Chicken was also well-prepared, with small but tender chunks of chicken breast.  The prices were a little more than what we are used to, which is odd because coming from Los Angeles almost everything is much cheaper in Las Vegas.  While we have not quite given up on trying some other places, we would be entirely satisfied to stick with Joyful House as our "go to" Chinese food in Las Vegas.
5 So far this is my favorite Chinese restaurant.  It is consistent. Everything tastes good. I always order the salt and pepper shrimp and beef chow fun. When I crave Chinese this is my go to.
4 I always get the peking duck and deep fried sea bass those two dishes are very good..everything else is what you expect just a little pricey..
3 Wasn't impressed with their Honey Walnut Shrimp. But their deep fried King Crab was delicious! Garlic fried Tofu was tasteful.
3 The only reason I didn't give Joyful another star is because they use dark meat chicken which I don't eat and they don't offer white meat at all :(   Service - on point.    Hot and Sour Soup - plentiful, flavorful and filling.  Made with mushrooms, tofu, dark seaweed, egg and more.    Sautéed Shrimp with Sweet and Sour Sauce - delicious if you like onions.    Decor - doesn't feel  like Vegas, more like a family owned (which I think it is) restaurant in a middle class neighborhood. Live lobster tank @ MP.   This is definitely my new go-to for Chinese in Vegas, when I don't want chicken.  Ive lived here for 5 years and only ate Panda Express for lack of anything better.
3 This is usually my fav Chinese spot to eat at in Vegas but today the food was just sooooo oily. I ordered chicken chow mein and sweet n sour chicken both seemed drenched in oil like I needed to let it drop a few times before I could even take a bite. I'll come back because I know they can do better but this order was not as good as it usually is.
4 Good food. Good service
4 This restaurant is very accommodating on changing up dishes with different sauces and providing what is specially requested.  For example, I asked for and got: 1) sliced ginger; 2) Hot Mustard Sauce; 3) Sweet & Sour Sauce; 4) Potsticker Sauce with onions; 5) Plum Sauce; 6) Hoisin Sauce; and 7) Hot Chili Oil.  As I have said previously in other reviews, I like to apply different sauces to various bites of potstickers.  And the medium-sized Pan Fried Potstickers I encountered here were very good.  Rounding out preliminaries, as a companion appetizer Crispy Fried Vegetarian Egg Rolls were crunchy and excellent.  Wonton Noodle Soup was also a hit, with well-filled wontons, fresh bok choy, and a tasty broth.  For entrees I sampled very fine lean Beef & Snow Peas with Black Mushrooms in Oyster Sauce; top of the line Kung Pao Chicken with solid all-white-meat fowl; outstanding and flavorful large Prawns with a vibrant Sweet & Sour Sauce; and quite tasty Honey Walnut Prawns.  Complimentary Jasmine Tea was outstanding in flavor, and both Chocolate and Strawberry Japanese Mochi Ice Cream were very refreshing.  Servers were solicitous of my party's needs, and quite professional in carrying out their tasks.  This was a fine Cantonese dining experience!  4-1/2 stars overall!  I will definitely be back!
5 The food is simply great, and the waiters are very helpful. They replace the used plate and serve the food very fast.
4 My family and I met here for Christmas lunch and the food was excellent. It was nice to finally get some old school Chinese instead of the same old buffet style that you see know days. We had 4 or 5 dishes and all of them were very good.The server went out of his way to please everyone at the table, even though the place was packed he did a great job keeping up with the pace. I will definitely be going back next time i'm in town.
4 Sweet corn chowder pretty good,( I would have liked it better with WHITE MEAT not dark meat, that's just me) Ordered Kung Pao Shrimp, but they brought us CHICKEN? We took it, & it was still yummy. And the best part was the Chilean Sea Bass steamed with bean sauce but hmmmm it had bones? Never ever had my Real Chilean sea bass WITH BONES? But the flavor was buttery & creamy and we could NOT stop eating it EVEN after we were full!!! WE WILL 4 SURE BE BACK!!! Most Asian clientele....
5 Dude. Get off of the strip and head to china town for the most amazing food of your life! We had the Chilean sea bass steamed with black bean sauce as well as the Kung pao chicken and a corn chowder soup with chopped chicken. The sea bass was melt in your mouth, buttery goodness. There were small bones in it, however, so beware. The Kung pao was amazing too. Both were served with rice and we sipped on their jasmine tea. It was PACKED so call ahead like we did. A+++!
5 CNN didn't give this place Top 50 Best Chinese Restaurants in America for nothing! This goes far beyond just a good Chinese restaurant. The seafood and meat was as fresh as it could get and the flavors were matched to perfection. I do not like msg, or salty food. This place made the flavors of the food pop, without any heavy sauces or salt. It was Chinese food heaven. A MUST eat before you die.
5 Great food, Good service, and Fair priced. I would suggest the beef and Portobello mushroom dish and Hot and Sour soup very good and a huge bowl. One of the best Chinese places in Vegas.
3 Clean Chinese restaurant along Spring Mountain Road. I guess the cleanliness, cloth table napkins and servers wearing tux are the reason why this Chinese restaurant is overpriced!  We had the basic salt and pepper pork chops, HK style seafood noodles, Chinese mustard greens with garlic and 1/2 order of roasted duck for $60!   The flavor was ordinary, nothing fancy.   Not sure if I'll be back. I suggest you just go to neighboring Chinese restaurants.
5 We decided to eat here for Chinese New Year because of the good reviews and it truly lived up to its reputation. A bit pricey, but worth it because of the food and ambience. I especially enjoyed the Chilean sea bass with black bean sauce, which just melted in my mouth and I couldn't stop eating it.  Bonus points for honest employee who returned my purse that I had left, right before we got into our car. Thank you.
2 My husband and I decided to try this restaurant because of the reviews. We ordered the pan seared Chilean sea bass, chicken fried rice and sweet and sour chicken. The sea bass was terrible! It was soaked in oil. The sweet and sour chicken was made with dark meat and precooked. The fried rice was excellent. I sent back the sea bass and was given the explanation of "this is how it's made", with an attitude. I asked for beef and broccoli instead. It was delish. As we the service, we were approached and asked for the entire order. We had not even looked at the menu. We weren't offered dipping noodles or tea, as the table behind us was. We will not be returning to this restaurant.
3 A very clean Chinese restaurant that has plenty of seating to accommodate large parties and good sized parking lot. Their menu comes with gorgeous pictures of their entrees, but unfortunately it doesn't transfer over to the real deal.   As this is a family style restaurant, we wanted to get around 6 - 7 items to share amongst each other. The entrees we got were;  Peking Duck: probably one of their best things here, good sized duck, lots of meat, very crispy skin, comes with the white bun and colorful shrimp chips, wasn't overly salty.  BBQ Combination Platter 1/2 size: This was my favorite along with the duck, I probably would have just gone with the full order and just taken off something else we ordered, the dish comes with fried chicken, jelly fish, pork loaf slices, meat loaf slices, and cha shu pork.  Honey Walnut Shrimp: Disappointing portion size, there was literally like 7 pieces of shrimp on there.....for $16 bux? Man we got jipped hard, I probably would recommend putting that money into a different dish. Clams in vermicelli special broth: clams were good but the broth wasn't that special, it was sort of bland, but it was different than the usual ways people order clams at Chinese restaurants. Steamed Egg plant with garlic sauce: Wasn't really garlic sauce, more like just sauteed egg plants with crushed garlic sprinkled on top, so technically, it needed some sauce. Yang Chow Fried Rice: decent, no real complaints from this, probably need some more salt. Pan Fried Chinese Broccoli: probably our only real healthy dish, it was good, nothing memorable from it, but we did finish it.  Overall, this restaurant is a decent Chinese joint.
2 Despite all the awards, there was certainly nothing spectacular about the meal - or the experience.   We were promptly greeted and seated - right under a TV airing Glee, and a speaker playing Top 40 from the 90s. A few people were seated in our section after we were...all American. The Asians were seated on the opposite side of the restauraunt.   We weren't offered any chopsticks...because we are American.   The food was really, really not great - especially for $30 per person. I could have ordered the same quality and taste from china a go go...maybe even Panda Express, for half the price.   But...the tea was good.  2/5 would not dine again.
4 Well, first off, we found that Chinatown in Las Vegas is nothing like Chinatown in San Francisco. It is a bunch of shops and mini-malls spread out along about a two-mile stretch of Spring Mountain Road, west of the I-15.  Joyful House has been listed as one of the best Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas, but in my opinion it's not THE best.   My wife and I and two high-school girls from Shanghai tried it out the other afternoon for an early dinner, and they, at least, seemed to think the food was somewhat authentic. We started out with bowls of West Lake Egg Flower Chowder, which I thought was somewhat bland. Adding a small amount of chili paste and a splash of shoyu (soy sauce) helped.  They ordered steamed chicken with ginger and mustard greens with mushrooms, but didn't seem to eat much of the greens. My wife and I tried the Pan Fried Spinach with Garlic, Barbecued Pork Fried Rice and Chicken Chow Fun. The latter actually wasn't much fun, as the noodles turned out to be really thick and hard to handle. We should have ordered the skinny noodles instead. I thought the fried rice was very good.   Serving sizes here are huge, so we had the leftovers boxed up and we found a couple of homeless guys down the street who really appreciated them.  We could have ordered a bit less and still fed one homeless person, but we got out the door for $95 (including tip) and thought it was quite a bit better than the typical Chinese place.
2 Not too good, not too bad.  My husband and I ordered the salt & pepper calamari, clams in black bean sauce and sesame chicken.  The calamari was pretty good, a little overrated but came out nice and crispy w/ salt and red pepper seasoning and some sliced Serrano peppers that were hella spicy.  The clams in black bean sauce wasn't that good, the sauce was super salty (we ordered it after reading all the rave reviews on it).  The sesame chicken was good, it's our safe go to dish whenever we eat Chinese food.  Our bill came out to $47.24 including a HongKong iced tea that was never refilled, a little disappointing since it cost $3.75.  Perhaps I'm just cheap but I'm used to paying $2.50~ for iced tea w/ unlimited refills.  Another disappointment was the cleanliness, lots of dust on the wood window sills along the restaurant.  Makes you wonder what the kitchen looks like.  Better get to cleaning before Darcy Spears hits them up and they end up on Action 13 new's Dirty Dining!  Eeeks.
3 Needing to get away from the Vegas strip for awhile, we searched on Yelp for a good Chinese restaruarnt and our party of 6 decided to come here for dinner.  We ordered: 3/5 Spicy hot and sour soup $14.25 3/5 Imperial peking duck $39 4/5 Seafood combo claypot with tofu $15.50 3/5 Eggplant, pork and bamboo claypot $12.50 5/5 Taiwan A vegetables $11.50 3/5 Yang Chow fried rice $11.95 Tsing Tao beer $3 each  The Peking duck was a bit disappointing as the skin was not as flavorful and crispy and the man who filleted the skin did not do a very good job. There were uneven pieces but nevertheless, we got to have Peking duck. The claypots were okay. The sauce was a bit heavy. The stir-fried A vegetables was the best! Over all we had a fun meal but the quality was just okay.
4 We ventured out to Joyful House with another couple and had another very good meal but not a five-star dining experience.  The broth of Seafood Wor Wonton Soup was quite flavorful, and the filled wontons very memorable, but a scary-looking Calamari, tough scallops, and inferior pork made the soup a story of contrasts.  Average-sized pan-fried Potstickers were good and I received my several requested condiments of sliced ginger, Sweet & Sour Sauce, Potsticker Sauce with onions, Hoisin Sauce, and Hot Chili Oil without any difficulty, and Shrimp-Fried Rice with carrots and peas was very good.    Beef & Snow Peas with Black Mushrooms in Oyster Sauce was a sumptuous Cantonese dish, and Kung Pao Chicken had a nice level of controlled heat.  Service by the well-trained and disciplined staff was consistently on the ball and responsive to needs.  Four solid stars this time out!
5 Great decor! Excellent food! Informed watier! Garlic Shrimp were to DIE for!
5 First time here. So delicious! Honey walnut shrimp, sweet and sour shrimp.....holy hell. So good. I've never had shrimp so good. Everything was so good. The service was very friendly and helpful. My first Chinese food since moving to Vegas in July, 2013. I can't wait to bring visitors here.
5 After a second visit I realize that not only is Joyful House above average Chinese but they are also very high end Chinese Dining.  Where else can you order Geoduck and not too many places offer Abalone. I do note that these are very high end luxury seafood items and do cost around $60. $70. a portion. They also have a variety of many reasonably priced fresh fish dishes and daily specials. Free range chicken is also on the menu. (I've never seen that at any other Chinese Restaurant).  We ordered the Sweet Corn Soup for two. Actually the portion is enormous and can feed 4-6 people. It's delicious and anyone would enjoy it. Our waitress offered us a hot chili sauce and soy sauce condiments with the soup.  I had to try the Braised Tofu with Bamboo Fungus. (I think it cost around $12.00) The presentation isn't good but the dish actually tasted good. Bamboo Fungus is actually a veil from a mushroom grown in Asia. It really has almost no flavor on it's own but does have a most interesting delicate texture and is suppose to be extremely beneficial to your health. Under the Tofu and Bamboo Fungus was a large pile of fresh Chinese Broccoli.  The Special of the day was Whole Flounder for $23.00 so we ordered one fried and it was served  de-Boned Table side.  Joyful House was a Joyful Experience and is on my Las Vegas Rotation!
5 I know it is a very good place to eat when I come into a city and look forward to my meal at a place I had eaten at on previous trips. This is the place. I can never go wrong with baby bok choy, eggplant & garlic and Singapore noodles. No rush, practice with the chopsticks, enjoy the tea. Breathe....
5 Good authentic food. :) my Chinese wife and mother in law (in from shanghai) enjoyed it.
3 The environment is clean with a spacious dining area.   There is a wide menu selection of seafood items   We ordered the following dishes:  1) Yang chow fried rice with BBQ pork and shrimp.  2) Fillet fish with vegetables  3) Sesame chicken  4) Half duck  My favorites were the fried rice and sesame chicken. The taste of each dish is average.
3 If I was writing this review 2 years ago this place would have 5 stars without a doubt. The food in this place is really good and the service is also but they've gotten greedy. I've been coming here for years and we liked this place so much we'd come at least 2-3 times a week for lunch and other times for take out. I highly recommend the tenderloin beef in black pepper sauce with portabella mushrooms, their fried rice and spicy crispy shirmp.  The prices have been on increasing regularly and the amount of food has gone down drastically, not good business. This last time I went for dinner with my parents and we all noticed how small the portions have gotten, it was really bad and that irritated me. The only good thing is that the quality of the food is still there but their competition is very close by (less than a mile down the road) and they've been consistent for years.
4 If you want good Chinese food served in a nice restaurant with good service this is the place to go off the Strip.  Try the clay pot dishes, chow fun, Peking duck, scallops in black bean sauce or any seafood dish and you can't go wrong.  Service can be inconsistent but the food is "dynomite."  Open late for those of use who get the munchies.
4 Have visited Joyful House on a number of occasions over the  years.  Very tasty authentic Chinese food.  Would recommend for those interested in trying it out.
3 Stopped in for lunch today because of all of the great reviews. I came in by myself and was greeted by a female waitress that didn't seem very happy. I was seated and ordered my drink. I asked about the lunch specials she looked borderline upset. I ordered the salt and pepper pork chop which was fantastic, I then decided to order the Crab Rangoon. About 5 minutes later I see an order of the lovely little cream cheese  babies headed my way...NOT...the waitress passed my table and put them on the table next to mine, ok fair enough they must have ordered them also. Not the case, 3 minutes later the other waiter comes and picks them up from them and says to me they are making me new ones. Not possible in the less than 1 minute they were in the back. I told them I did not want them. They should have left them on the other peoples table and REALLY made me new ones. But I will say the food tasted wonderful, they just need some skills in service!!
5 Best Damm Chinese Food EVER, The Real Mccoy, You Gotta To Try it.
5 Best of Las Vegas 2014 !!!  Way to go.  Love the food, been going to Joyful House for 15+ years.  Always been a reliable Chinese restaurant.
5 We found Joyful House by accident in February 2014.  Food, service, atmosphere all were excellent.  We told some friends about it, and when we all came back to town together in early May 2014 we decided it was a must to get in there again.  We were NOT disappointed!  Crab Ragoons, Chicken Chow Yuk, Mongolian Beef, Lettuce Wraps (And more) were all very well prepared and the service was (AGAIN) fabulous!!
5 Been going here for years! Love this place! We always order our usual beef chow fun with gravy,honey walnut shrimp , salt and pepper pork chops and salted fish fried rice..yumm! Best Chinese food I've tasted by far.
3 I really miss my go to chinese places in los angeles,alas Im not in kansas anymore,I have landed in mediocre land. Its not the food was bad it just didnt blow me away,I find myself comparing everything to what i am used to and unfortunately it falling woefully short. The potstickers were super weak,I mean worse then supermarket frozen weak. The BBQ pork fried rice needed flavoring and was a bit on the dry side. The shrimp in lobster sauce was average. The kung po chicken was ok,and the best dish was the mongolian beef a bit of sweet and hot flavor,pretty tasty. All in all it was another just ok experience,my search continues :)
4 Great food w/o waiting to long. Can improve on the service. Overall I will come back to this place.
3 Portions here are really big, so I would recommend asking the server if what you ordered is too much food or just right.  The hot and sour soup is delicious but the duck was super greasy and kinda flavorless.  Fried rice was massive portions. I mean, massive.   And of course, you get your standard you're-a-gringo-in-an-Asian-restaurant neglectful service.   For being such a renowned place here on Vegas, I wasn't all that impressed.
4 Good Chinese food is hard to find in Vegas so consider this your notice!  Joyful house is delicious flavor is 8/10 customer service 7/10 and the fact that they don't close til 3am in a 24 hr city gives them bonus points. For the most part I only go here for Chinese food. I recommend the salt and pepper shrimp (shells on) and the roasted duck, never dry! Can't say I'm surprised they have so many awards bestowed upon the restaurant. I appreciate consistency.
4 Was here about midnite on a weeknight: - Went with the $18(?) bbq combo platter app.  Options were pork, duck and jellfish and I went with the first two.  Don't know how they do it, but the pork & duck were flavorful.   - It's a nice restaurant and an upgrade from the typical Chinese restaurant service/decor, and the menu prices seemed to reflect that. - Definitely a good choice to eat a nice Chinese restaurant off-Strip.
1 This place is absurdly expensive and a tourist trap. They don't have any lunch specials on the weekends or a lunch menu for that matter, so we had to order 1 plate of honey walnut shrimp from the dinner menu (even though it was 2:30pm on a Saturday afternoon).   Honey Walnut Shrimp with Mayonnaise $16.50 -- The portion was small (10 med/small sized shrimp) the shrimp tasted very fishy and like they were frozen, also barely gave us any walnuts. We did not enjoy this dish at all. KJ kitchen's version costs less, gives you more shrimp, and gives a ton more walnuts.   Their rice was dry and tasted dirty. Not sure how a legitimate Chinese restaurant can mess this up?   I was shocked they didn't have the real deal homemade authentic saté chili sauce in oil. They brought out the commercial bright red sambal oelek from a bottle which tasted weird and not spicy at all. Very disappointing.   Overall our meal was not worth $20, everything was unsatisfactory.
5 This was one of the best Chinese restaurants I've been to and the service was fast and excellent! Great find!
4 Best Chinese food I've had in Vegas. Quick courteous service, pleasant decor, large portions and everything was cooked as I specially requested. Much better than that PF place. Easy to get to from my hotel on the strip, too.
4 Have to this place several times, with late night groups and for dinner for two. Have also done take-out. Have never been disappointed. The service is very good, the food is always great. The Salt and Pepper Pork Chops are always a must have.
5 Delicious food here. Got free sweat ice tea and soup. Broccoli beef was great. Chicken is fresh. Prices are pretty good as well. Would recommend!
3 I had great expectations when I came especially when I saw many posters and banners saying that it's one of the "Best Chinese Restaurant in United States". Sadly it doesn't seem entirely true at all. The foods were moderate, some were delicious, but too oily. I had a lot of people with me that day and one large plate of food seemed little. I thought I ordered a lot of food but it wasn't enough in the end. Overall I give it a fair rating but would I go there again? Sure- it's affordable and worth the cost as a whole.
4 This place ranks in the top 5 with my family. The food was excellent and plentiful! Our group of 4 adults and 3 children(under 10) was treated very well. They were very nice to the kidlings and grea with us grown-ups too. More then enough food to make us all happy. Thank you for making dinner out with friends so very nice!
2 While we were ordering, the man behind the counter was full on picking his nose.  It was revolting.  If we were not starving after already leaving the line at a dim sum house and having to get my son home before late nap meltdown occurred, I would have absolutely left.  It is beyond disgusting that they had an employee standing there picking his nose.  That being said, the combination dry fat rice noodle dish was delicious.  It tasted the way I like it being cooked.  The sesame chicken is a skip it.  It was our least favorite dish.  The kung pao shrimp was tasty.  Our service was terrible.  I had to keep flagging people down to help us.    I would not go back.  The prices are too expensive for what you get.
1 This restaurant sadly has become very mediocre.  Too expensive, crab in claypot is $68.00, which very little crabmeat.  Steamed veggies $16.50, total bill for three $168.00, total ripoff. AVOID! I used to be a huge fan of this place but not any more.
3 Food was pretty good; service was prompt but not excellent; open til late night like at least 2am.  I loved the fried fish filet in cream corn sauce; portion was not small and good enough to feed the hungry crowd!  For those of you looking for something fancier like shark fin, bird's nest, etc., this place's got it!  Prices in general were alright and acceptable.
1 What...In...The...WORLD were people thinking giving this place any more than one star?? This food is just nasty and the absolute lowest grade meat you could possibly eat! Trust me, I know about this stuff. The meat is DISGUSTING!  Best in Vegas award? Something tells me they know somebody who knows somebody. That is the biggest lie I've heard since moving here! Oh yeah, and they're over priced! What a joke. I so regret giving them my money.
4 We are in Vegas for the July 4 weekend and wanted to get away from the casinos food.  I searched Yelp for Chinese Restaurants and this one had 4 solid stars. It was a couple miles from our hotel so I decided to check it out. This place is elegant but comfortable, you would be fine in casual wear. It is clean and the male host that met us at the door also waited on us and was very friendly and accommodating.  We ordered Mongolian Beef, Lemon Chicken, Yang Chow Fried Rice and Mustard Greens in Broth. We got our made to order food in less than 5 minutes and each dish was great.  The beef melted in my mouth; the Lemon Chicken was crispy on the outside and tender inside; and fried rice and the mustard green dish were both scrumptious. However, at $60.86 it may be a little pricey for some but it is worth it. Nevertheless. I am giving them 4 1/2 Yelp Stars.  I will definitely come back when I am in Vegas again.
5 Great customer service, great food! Just a few notes, lunch portions are huge, interior is nice & warm, its clean. Thanks again! Will definitely go back!! ^_^
5 First time here for us. Nestled in the heart of Sin City's "Chinatown;" this place is a gem of qualify Chinese food with an authentic atmosphere that keeps you feeling welcome even after you leave.   We had the "Dinner A," which includes mushroom eggdrop soup; a small appetizer medley of egg rolls, wontons, and pot stickers; chicken fried rice; beef choy mein; sweet and sour pork; and cashew chicken. We also had hot tea and Thai iced coffee with boba!  Literally everything was perfectly prepared and delicious! What do we recommend? Yes. Thank you Joyful House, we'll be back!
4 Good late night Chinese food. A little on the pricey side, but hey for 2am. I can't complain.
