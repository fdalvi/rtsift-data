4 This boutique store has been opened since July 2008.  It's right near Kona Grille.  It has labels like Per Se, EtcEtc, Carlisle which are adorable, perky, modern to fit all different body types.  There's a 50% off clearance rack.  The salespeople vary in age & body habituses also which is good to see.
5 Great location in Boca Park. They carry the same lines that my other Eccoci review carries, so I'll just copy it for you:   Incredible deals on upscale ready-to-wear clothing with couture detailing. They carry Carlisle, Etcetera, Per Se and Eccoci brands as well as some shoes and a new men's line. Fabrics are usually natural - merino wool, silk, cotton blends. In the Carlisle and Per Se lines, seams are bound, as are button holes. Everything is lined and the designs are very NYC meets Europe chic. Unlike anything you'll find in Vegas. I LOVE this store!
5 Unbelievable designs & clothing.  This is a must place boutique to go get FASHIONIZED!! Fabulous styles, Timeless pieces, Quality to die for!  Weekend Events always happening. I love this store!
