3 They get it where it needs to go.
1 I have been a customer here since 2003. If you get the old lady and there is no one else in there, run!  She is a joke, constantly complains about Fedex and her hours being cut. You will wait at least 30 minutes because she constantly makes mistakes, charged me $10.85 for local over night one week and $24.30 the next week for the same delivery. She loves to argue and the customer is always wrong, as an employer I would love to fire a hag like this! I have a current complaint filed with Fedex over this person but honestly, go to the shipping center a few doors down, they also do UPS and Fedex. The other option is to wait until 2:00 PM, shift change and the other girl who works here is awesome!!
