2 Mixed review on this one.  First time I went there with my Dad, we didn't have an appointment and waited an hour and a half.  When I finally checked on why it was taking so long (they said it would be at least an hour wait), they had already passed over his name, claiming they called it.  I was in the chair closest to the receptionist calling names and I didn't hear it.  Second time, I set up a profile on line, tried to make an appointment unsuccessfully so we went when there was an opening (according to the appointment schedule).  I just sat down and they called his name.  It took less than 5 minutes in and out.   So I don't know what to think.  Good luck if you go here.   Over the last few months, my family has had numerous mix ups with this lab and my Dad's records and need for lab work.  It's the most convenient for him so don't really want to go somewhere else but something has changed with this lab in the last 1-3 years and it's not for the better!
2 They do not tell you that they do not accept Michigan B/C B/S insurance when the orders are written by a Mi. dr. until they send you a bill 9 months later.  The billing department has good job security because they take a quite a while to get a hold of  and because there are a lot of former patients like me trying to see what's going on.
1 This place is horrible, been waiting almost 2 hours for a urine test and I told them I really needed to pee and they told me we only have two people working and that I just need to hold it.
