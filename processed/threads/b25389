5 United Lock Service is the most honest, dependable, and reasonably priced locksmith in the area. Nathan was ontime and he even called me to let me know he was on the way so I didn't have to sit around and guess what time he was coming. He was professional, efficient, and didn't try to up sell me. I highly recommend him for all your lock smith needs.
5 Same day service- even on Sunday!  Nathan met me on time and was thorough and quick!  He did what I asked him to and his pricing was reasonable.  If you have Angie's List there may be a coupon or two available but regardless for the quick, no-nonsense locksmith give United Lock Service a call!
5 Nathan was punctual, professional and very reasonably priced.  We had our new house completely re-keyed. In 40 minutes all of the locks were re-keyed, the locks were locking and unlocking better than before and duplicate keys made. I would not hesitate to use United Lock Service again.
5 Called to have a broken house lock replaced, and Nathan arrived in less than 20 minutes. He was friendly and articulate. The lock cylinder was replaced and keyed to match another door lock. Work was done within 10-15 minutes, and a printed receipt provided. Cost was $75, but think they have Angie's list coupon as noted by another reviewer. Speedy and competent service, just what I was hoping for!
