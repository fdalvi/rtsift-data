5 This studio is state of the art, very professional and relaxed atmosphere!! Great staff very friendly and informative. They focus on performance while most studios focus on lessons. Its mainly a rock and roll based studio with private lessons and group ensemble classes.
1 Good idea in theory, however it's a shame that its so poorly ran. Director is a liar and a cheat.  I would never send my children to this hole in the wall. I'd rather pay top dollar for private lessons with educated and professional musical instruction, rather than pay tuition to this place that is housed by nothing more than garage band rejects.
5 My son has attended the School of Rock since it opened back in October of 2011, Im not an easy parent to please when it come's to my child's musical education..My son has taken private lessons since he was 8, he joined the school of rock at age 13 and has grown more as musician in the last year in a half than the previous 5 years...You see the School of Rock is much more than just lesson's, they put the kid's in performance groups and they play actual concert's at place's like The Hard Rock on the strip, club Vinyl, the Copa Room and the South Point ShowCase Theater  to name a few...You can't put a price tag on experience's like those...It's not much more costly or time consuming than your child playing sport like baseball, basketball or football and unless your kid is the star on the sport's team, I can almost assure your child will enjoy playing with other kid's instead of in their room or sitting on the bench during a game...
5 I have attended the School of Rock since the opening in October of 2011, and I can say it has been one of the most valuable experiences I have ever had as a musician. The staff has always been friendly, and the lessons taught there have helped me become a great musician. I'm really glad for the School of Rock and know that anyone who walks in those doors will be too.
