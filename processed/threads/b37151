5 JoAnn is a very gifted therapist and uses a gentle and effective touch to resolve sore muscles and pain. The first time she did a cranial sacral session, I had such a tight calf muscle due to overplaying sports (sand volleyball). I felt instant relief and was playing again in 2 days. She is excellent for pain relief and can help pinpoint the core issue and provide relief in such a gentle manner. Highly recommend!!
5 Joann Is so amazing. If you ever want craniosacral therapy, she is the woman to go to. Shes extremely knowledgeable, gentle, and in tuned to your needs. I would definitely recommend her!
5 Enjoyed reflexogy session with Joann. ^_^ Quite knowledgeable, and warm. My session was very relaxing as well.   My only complaint is that I only opted for 60minutes! Lol.  Give Joann a go. She also offers craniosacral therapy -- my next session!
