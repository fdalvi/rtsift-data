4 This is a great stop for a quick patron shot or rendezvous with friends/family before heading out for a night on the town. I knew I was really in Vegas when I saw that this place had patron on tap. LOL! I had to stop. Patron on tap is something I'd never seen.
4 This place does not have a name brand chef, true that. The price is in line for the food served considering this is Vegas & the strip. The 2 of us ate for $54. Our bar tab for 2 delicious Margo-Ronas was $24 pushing the tab & tip up. Perhaps I'm not feeling the pinch because a similar drink in DC would cost more.   For entrees, we had the Pork-Pibil (4.25 stars) & the Steak Picado (3 stars), service by Gustavo(4.5 stars), ambiance (4.5 stars), drinks(5 stars). Average = 4.25 for rating. That is a-okay in a city with so many big name chefs and prices. If you are not a buffet grazer, this is a very decent alternative.  This restaurant is inside Planet Hollywood Casino, near PF Chang's.
5 My husband and I went for dinner last friday. The food was great, the service was on point and the staff was very friendly. We ended up staying for karaoke for late night. We sang, we drank some more and just had a great time.  We will definitely be back! Thanks Yolos for a wonderful time!!
3 I ate here primarily because A. I stayed in this hotel and B. they had televisions for the World Cup. I ordered their sangria which was tasty. I had the tostada which was just fine. The ambiance is decent enough for a Vegas eatery. I'd go back.
