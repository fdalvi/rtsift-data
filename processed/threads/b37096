4 What a great deal - book 3 hours in advance and save 15%.  Just randomly (and fortunately) came across GV Taxi on a Google search, in hopes of cutting costs to get back to Phoenix airport.  Their website gives you a quote, so you know your costs up front - without calling or waiting on an email quote.   Daniel, my driver, was courteous and helpful.  I received a text confirmation, as well as email confirmation, which told me this company has to be legit.  $20 from Old Town Scottsdale to Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, deal!    I will definitely book with Great Value Taxi Cab again for my future travels in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  Highly recommended!  P.S. - They also take credit card - a plus for business travelers
5 Made a reservation online for a 545 AM trip to Sky Harbor. Received multiple confirmations, including a text a half hour before the pick up. There is a discounted  rate for airport trip with advance notice. Cab was on time (a little early actually) and clean. Service wet much appreciated; will use for airport transfers in the future.
4 Just got picked by Daniel.   He text to say he was on his way. And was kind enough to say he would be 6 min. Lol. It was more like 2. He helped load the car which was clean and even more important smelled great. I recommend this car service. You won't be disappointed.
