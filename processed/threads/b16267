5 Nice staff, cheap smokes. We always come here!
5 There are a lot of smoke shops in Las Vegas, but this one is as honest as they get. They carry all different styles of pipes and smoking material and they are kind to patients. I bypass the made in China stuff due to the cheapness of the material. I don't mind paying a little extra for American hand blown glass pipes. Not easily broken and I feel better made for the price. The staff is very knowledgeable also and this helps when making a decision on buying a nice pipe or water pipe. Built in humidor keeps all of their wraps fresh as the day they were wrapped. Great pricing, but even BETTER quality of people and products.Check out the 1.00 candy bars on the way out. Less than a convienience store .
3 Come here to get hookah and cigars from time to time. Cool guy runs. Typical smoke shop once youve seen one you've seen em all
5 American Hand Blown glass pipes. Enough said!
1 Owner is a profit driven douchebag hey nothing wrong with hustling but he hustles in a rude thoughtless way..asked him to start carrying " sage" incents every time I go in and he refuses to even acknowledge the request..
1 The owner (pakistani guy) is just so rude and he always change his prices. Just so u know guys they don't put tag prices on they're vape and e-liquids so they can change it everytime they want. Zero star would be the accurate rate for this store.
