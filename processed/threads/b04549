5 I trust them with my various cars and have for decades. You will always get the straight scoop and great work from David, Ray Ron and Wayne.  Kevin J.
3 Took my car to verify the a/c. It spend 2 days in the shop! I had to call twice and go to the place to have an up-date on it. Having only 1 vehicle is a pain, After all the stress they had "find" the problem but were not able to answer all my questions. I understand the stress of dealing with persons but I also think that as a customer I needed a little more effort. At the end I still have the problem. But will rather take my car here than to the Walmart Shop.
5 We have been taking our cars to David and Calverts almost since we moved to Buckeye in 1982. You couldn't ask for a more reliable and honest bunch.  They don't overcharge for anything. I have taken my truck to them a couple of times wanting things replaced or repaired, only to have David call me and tell me I didn't need that work done. Saved me a lot of money. This is a great small town place to get good honest work done. And, if by chance they happen to make a mistake, the will make sure it gets fixed the right way, sometimes with no extra charge.  Big fan of these guys!
5 We are always looking for an Honest guy to work on our cars but Calvert's has so much more, cleanest carwash in the state, cleanest bath rooms I have ever seen at a gas station, like those super gulps for a buck.  Thanks Dave
5 I usually always buy my gas here and the price is always reasonable. I've even had my car serviced here a few times and David always makes sure its right!! Also very nice car wash attached to the gas station that works very well!
