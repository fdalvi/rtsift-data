1 This is a tough one to review.  So much is a matter of taste as opposed to a matter of fact.  I do not like Aeropostale.  This one is at Chandler Fashion Center.  The staff was very nice, friendly, and helpful.  This time I was returning something my wife bought.  No problems.  But for shopping, I do not like this place.  I find their quality to be low, and I can't stand being a walking billboard for their store.  A small logo is fine (and some of their stuff has just that), but most of their stuff says "AERO" in huge letters.  Must be a 500 pt font!  And while the fabrics are usually very soft (which is why my wife likes it), it is not durable.  I have a couple of shirts developing holes just from routine wearing (no yard work or such, just wearing to work or shopping or whatever) in less than a year.  As I have many shirts, these have only been worn/washed maybe 8 times in that year, and they already have holes.  I'd rather shop someplace with higher quality, and a smaller font.
1 The girls that work there are too busy to chatting to say hi, unlock fitting rooms, or ring up customers. I wanted to try on some shorts... they didn't even look at me. I didn't want to interrupt their very important conversation so I just took my business elsewhere.
3 This is the only store where pants fit me. Size 0 SHORT. They have it. Hallelujah!  I feel like everything else is overpriced.  Customer service is really good. Commission maybe? CSR showed me where the jeans are and grabbed me a couple different styles when the one I tried on wasn't fitting me the best. And she gave twizzlers to my kids (daughter was crying and she was totally cool about it).  The fitting room was GROSS. I see the pics on here from last year and it still looks they way, actually it's worse. Like they haven't cleaned them at all. I didn't take my shoes off ( which made trying on jeans super difficult). I don't get it. Every retail job I've ever had you'd have to sweep out the fitting rooms and clean the mirrors EVERYDAY. How is that being overlooked?  I come here for the pants. In and out.
