3 A very welcome sight on a Sunday morning this was. Good value bacon and egg roll (£1.45) and definitely preferable to the Costa in the Broughton Road Tesco.    A wide variety of other dishes are on offer and the vfm is maintained by their Credit Crunch Lunch - 2 soups, 2 rolls and 2 coffees (I assume tea also) for £10.
