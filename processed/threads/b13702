5 This place is hardly hidden! the bright neon lights will scoot your shuffle in a hurry through the door if your not careful. I especially like Dion's services. Whenever I feel bushy-centric I have that artist do a new number on my "do". I have never gotten so many compliments on a twisty landslide like that since before I was married!
4 This was a good experience for many reasons... I took my 15 year old brother in there to have a facial and they were good with him, and educated him on skin care.  It was fairly priced... it did not have all the bells and whistles of a fancy resort spa... but I don't always have all day to hang out and enjoy what they charge. A clean comfortable facility... it had a plush feel to it, but still a nice medical clean aspect.
5 I had a great facial at Mozaik! My skin looked and felt so hydrated.  Excellent customer service.
5 Ti is AMA-ZING!  It's hard to find a good lash tint gal and the tint lasted me 4-6 weeks.  Comfortable and in an upscale spa. Enjoy!
