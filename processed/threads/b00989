4 Less than 15 minutes to change a car battery on a weekend day without an appointment?  Awesome!!  After getting a jump start at the airport (my car decided to seek revenge on not going on vacation with me by killing the battery in my absence), I rummaged through my glove compartment to figure out where I had purchased my last car battery.  Turns out it was a couple of years ago at another Checker establishment.  This Indian School location is the closest to my house so I drove straight there, pulled up and was literally on the road again within minutes.  Checker has great warranties on their batteries - 24 months guarantee for a free replacement and big discounts thereafter.  I only ended up paying $40 for my new one.  My only complaint is that it's difficult to see this Checker from the road.  It's in the back of the shopping center near the Food City.  At least that means plenty of parking when you roll your autos in for new parts. :)
4 Jesus the manager is a good guy! Blistering hot day and he changed my battery under warranty without question. While "service with a smile" is not on anyone's mind at this Checker (now O'Rieley"s) they get the job done.
