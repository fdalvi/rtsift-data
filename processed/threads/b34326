3 More of a bar than a restaurant.  There are three or four booths for eating as well as a couple of high tables.  Then of course there's the bar area.  There are also a couple of pool tables.  Seeing as how it's mostly a bar, the smell of smoke was overwhelmingly strong.  For an appetizer we had the spinach dip.  It was a bit too creamy and could use more spinach.  It wasn't very warm when it came out either (not that big of a deal as the dip usually cools off before it's finished anyways, but I wish it would have started out hotter).  I had the reuben sandwich.  It was alright.  The dressing and sauerkraut were good.  The meat (I believe pastrami, but it may have been corned beef, I can't remember) was a little dried out.  The bread was a little over toasted.  It was an okay size, but I feel $10 was a little too much money.  The fries were good, not too thin, and not too crispy either.
2 Went here because my co-worker talked about how good it is.  I beg to differ about this one!  He said the burger was huge....It wasn't, he also said the fries were awesome!  Um, they were limp, and they weren't crispy!   I'm glad I decided to split my burger with my co-worker, because it would have just been some wasted calories!   I almost forgot that I went here, if it wasn't for this popping up for me to review it!
5 This Putters has slots, 2 little pool tables, dart games, and the BEST BARTENDER EVER... James!!!
3 This place is a small, smoky bar complete with TVs, 2 pool tables and 2 dart boards. Service is ok and if you're sitting at the tables like we were you might not get any service if you come too early in the day. The beer was cold but the food was mediocre at best...They have happy hour daily from 3 to 6 pm, as well as a daily food special which is all dirt cheap...like 5 or 6 bucks for most entrees. This is a good place to watch sports or play pool/darts, but once you leave you smell like an ashtray even if no one around you was smoking!
