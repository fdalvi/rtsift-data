4 This store is huge- so much space, no cramped walkways here. It's larger than the one at Fashion Show Mall. I didn't buy anything but the the inventory was pretty big, though. I just wanted to browse. It seemed to have different products than the one at Fashion Show Mall. I noticed huge oversized stuffed animals, luggage and bags (not seen at the Fashion Show Mall, not recently anyway). Cute stuff for the Sanrio enthusiast. Worth taking a look. A funny story- we bumped into my husband's old classmates from grade school- small world, huh? Typical for Vegas.
5 *****100th Review**100th Review**100th Review**100th Review*****  Hello Kitty and I have been best friends since I was born.... Yup, it's been a life long sweet expensive relationship that I refuse to give up. This cute cat can cheat on me, abuse me, throw me under the bus and I won't ever leave her....Ever since I was given a Hello Kitty 5 times bigger than me as a newborn I can't imagine my life without Hello Kitty!!!!   This store is big which would sound great  space wise but I can't help but feel that with all this space you lose that -**True Sanrio Store squeeze through the isles while products are falling, Hello Kitty in your face cramped fun nostalgic feeling-**  Other than that this store is awsome but to tell you the truth I can't imagine not liking a Sanrio Store anywhere.... The employees are always nice and on certain Saturdays you can find someone dressed up as Hello Kitty which brings a smile to both kids and adults faces.   So for all your cute stylish needs - whether it's a purse,luggage,coffee maker,nail file,key chain, stationary,stickers,earsers, ect... (I could go on forever!!!) Sanrio is the place to be and if Hello Kitty herself isn't your cup of tea she has many other friends that may be more your fancy......
3 This place is just okay. I decided to browse around Sanrio and reenact my childhood a bit. I always get nostalgic with Hello Kitty products. This location isn't particularly large and I didn't think they had a great stock of items, but it's good if you're in the neighborhood.
2 I only give it 2 Stars because they do have a nice selection of Sanrio products and the store is quite nice but the customer service is seriously lacking and I will never spend any money at this establishment again.    I have been at this location 3 times in the past year and each time have been less then impressed with their staff.  They seem completely uninterested in their customers and seem only focused on their personal life based on the overheard conversations.    Sayonara Kitty...
5 Cool store hiding in Town Square!  They have a large selection...much bigger than the old Sanrio store in Fashion Show Mall.  Pretty sure the new one there might be bigger though when it is finished.  I found a lot of cool things, but decided on a plush doll.  They had some cool clothes, bags, piggy banks, phone covers, and everything else under the sun.  Check it out for all your HK needs!
