2 It's not what it use to be. :/
5 When we were getting close to our due date and the panic to find a pediatrician set in, I was lucky to come across Estrella Pediatrics and especially Dr. Bennett. His bedside manner from the very beginning was very nurturing and has a really patient demeanor.   One added bonus to this office is the split waiting room- half for the sick children and half for the children who are there for well-child visits. I've been on both sides of that wall and it makes me feel a lot better that my little guy isn't getting sneezed on when he's not sick and not contaminating some other poor kid when he is.
3 The phone staff are have been rude to me several times. Although we love our doctor, Dr. Grasil.
