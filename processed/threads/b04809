4 Nice little store which feels it has been here forever. They have a huge array of southwestern and cowboy collectibles...   And all I got was this lousy Wikenburg shot glass...
2 Brought my well behaved and socialized Service Dog in Training into this Tourist Trap and was told by the older woman working behind the counter, and these are her exact words, "I would have appreciated being asked to bring a dog, ANY dog, service dog or not, into the store because we normally have a very mean, territorial labrador here who would have made the situation DANGEROUS for you and and your dog!"
1 The service in this tourist trap moves at a snail's pace or is nonexistent. The older woman behind the counter is way too busy changing register tape and rearranging her pencils to wait on customers who want to see jewelry under the counter or have questions about the handmade pottery. When the younger woman working there got back with snacks (a girl's gotta eat) the other lady asked her to handle the customers so she can give her full attention to tasks not involved in customer service. We waited for 10 minutes in the two person "line" to make a purchase. I would recommend old town Scottsdale as apposed to charming Wickenburg as these stores all get their stuff from the same place in China. LOL.
