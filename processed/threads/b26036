5 Miguel really knows his stuff. They have a great selection, and the cigars are all in perfect condition. I found a rare Montecristo that was one of the best smokes I've ever had. Definitely gonna stop here next time I'm in Vegas!
5 It's a good smoke shop the first time there I picked up 12 sticks for myself and a box for my brother in law, then a mix box of Cohiba and MonteCristo and will be back in September for another box. No complaints here just aging them in my humidor and smoking on special occasions and when in the mood.Thanks Miguel
