5 Literally you cannot get a better gym experience for the price.  Keep in mind this is not the place for gym rats or people looking for serious amenities. This is a place where you can always find a machine and get the job done quickly without worrying about what you look like while doing it. I've never seen anyone hunting for a date and never felt uncomfortable getting my sweat on.
4 I really enjoy this gym, mainly because it is nearly almost always empty.  I can't stand waiting for equipment when I am working out.  I want to get in and out as quick as possible!
4 I joined this gym so I could work out after I had surgery and I am slowly trying to gain my strength back in my legs after being wheelchair bound for 6 months. The gym is pretty new and I like the fact I can work out and no one is bugging me to sign up for all the extra training sessions and such. The only negative I would say is my first time there was not very welcoming, no tour of the facility or anything so I am not sure really how to work much of the equipment. Nothing was explained such as the massage tables and massage chairs I had to ask how they worked. Overall worth the 19.99 a month and if it helps me in the end, its a great deal.
1 My one experience at this gym was bizarre and uncomfortable. Staff was unprofessional and unwelcoming.  They claim to give off a non- judgement vibe.... Funny because I've never felt so judged and uncomfortable @ a gym in my life!
