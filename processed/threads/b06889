4 Went there after a terrible experience at Dick's. I needed some football gear for my son and the people there were terrific and knowledgeable about their products.
5 Love M C Sports!  Great prices, good sales, friendly staff, good product selection.  Did I mention helpful staff?  Sometimes there is low employee coverage but hey if you happen to be there when there is a forcasted slow period you will still get what you want.  M C Sports it is where you go for good prices, friendly staff and great sales.
5 We have been going to MC Sports for ski equipment for a few years now. Service is excellent, the staff is always very knowledgable and helpful. We recently picked up some ski boots for my 13 yr old daughter, they did a great job fitting the boots and the price was fantastic, on sale for $99 when Chalet Ski up the street charges $170 for the exact same boot. Highly recommend them.
