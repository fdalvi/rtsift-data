4 Been frequenting ever since we moved to the neighborhood. Great , reasonably priced, fast take out, fresh flavorfull food that always satisfies. Plus, the kids love it. Thanks Beijing Beijing.
2 Oh my! Tried this place for the first time tonight - will not be going back. Egg drop soup - not good, egg rolls - not good, General's Chicken - worst I've ever had. The broccoli in the entree smelled bad, it was the first time I've ever had General's Chicken with a deep red coating on the chicken and no sauce. Heck - I didn't even get a fortune cookie - what kind of Chinese place is this. The prices were good compared to other Chinese places but it really doesn't matter if the food isn't any good.
2 Simply put...I've had better.  I ordered two meals with fried rice.  The rice contained hard pieces that were uneatable, yuck!  Crab ragoons had an imitation crab flavor and sadly to say, I think Panda Express does it better.
1 Very unsatisfied. I will never go back to this place again and I urge you not to waste your money. Poor customer service, I called to complain about the take out I had ordered, it was nasty and I asked if I could bring it back and get my money back or they could make me something different and she said no there was nothing she could do and she told me she was the owner. She also compared returning my food like returning a car someone just bought. I have never been so angry about the way a business owner treated me.  Horrible way to run a business.
2 I dont know how this place stayed open. The last thing I ordered was horrible it was something simple that I figured couldn't be messed up: Chicken Fried Rice... the chicken was dark and hard, the taste was horrible. I tried the place again hoping for a better visit... not impressed.
2 Consistently disappointing. Best thing about this place is it is close. But the Yelp definition of  two stars describes it perfectly: "Meh. I've experienced better."  Got the take-out every few weeks for a couple of years. Did I mention it was convenient? But it was never anything special. Didn't poison me, but was never exciting. Eventually made to switch to a place on Ray road, and have never been back to Beijing Beijing since. Hope you find this helpful.
