5 There is no grooming place like this anywhere in Arizona.  The owners are kind, caring people and the pets they groom feel the love.  Our Westie gets excited as we round the corner on grooming day.  It is clear she loves her spa day!  I highly encourage anyone who wants their dog to have the best experience anywhere to go here.  It is the best we have ever been to.  They do an amazing job!
5 We have been taking our two dogs to TTTPPO  since they opened a couple years ago. They do an amazing job each and every time. I love that the dogs are not kenneled for the duration of their visit and upon pick up they are usually happily sitting in the lap of one of the owners. They treat your pets as if they are their own. Make sure you schedule your appt well in advance, because they are usually booked out a couple  of weeks.
5 I so thankful that I found Lori and Dale!  I was looking for a groomer 3-4 years ago and someone at the dog park recommended Talk to the Paw.  It had recently opened.  Not only am I very happy with the quality of the grooming and the reasonable price, but Lori and Dale are fabulous, kind, trustworthy people who really love dogs.  They are actually the only people I trust with my furry girl, Roxy, when I am away from home for any reason.  You do need to book with Lori in advance, but that is because she does such an excellent job.
5 Lori and Dale are the absolute best! They do a wonderful job with grooming and my dog adores them! It's a happy, stress-free environment with people who genuinely love what they do - and it shows!
