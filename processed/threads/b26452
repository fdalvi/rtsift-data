2 Clerk # 0772834 does not know what she is doing but has no problem being condescending to customers. Amazing how RUDE some people can be.
2 Expensive booze, expensive snacks, ghetto clientele, and no restroom D: Only good things are the parking structure and plenty of sunscreen available for purchase.
3 This is the only worthwhile drugstore near the Stratosphere (15 min walk) so we ended up here. I wish we had found this place earlier in the trip.  In any case, they had everything we needed at reasonable prices. I didn't feel like the cold greedy grip of Vegas was getting me here.  I was annoyed by the timeshare salesperson outside the door.
