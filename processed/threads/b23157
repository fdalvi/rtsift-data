5 I ordered my custom made door and it arrived recently for installation. The design was exactly to specifications, quality of construction and the finish are flawless. It took several months to get but it was worth it. This one improvement has increased the value of my home and makes my entire family feel safer.
1 Flaky and overpriced  Avoid this company.  I needed a simple entry door installed quickly because a previous contractor had lost the original door, leaving my home exposed to cold winter temperatures.  Daniel Gonzalez at Dynasty Iron Doors came to my house and measured the opening, but did not provide me with an estimate until the following Monday.  He claimed he could complete the job in 1-2 days.  After I hired him, he failed to deliver the door on several occasions.  After two weeks, he still hadn't delivered the door and he failed to return my phone calls.    I hired another contractor who finished the job the very next day in 2.5 hours, and at half the cost quoted by Dynasty.
4 In November 2009 I placed an order and provided a $4,000 (50%)deposit for two garage doors. In January I was told there was a delay on the order because Dynasty was in financial trouble. I still to not have the doors and am now told I'm looking at a total of 7 months. I requested the return of 50% of my deposit as a measure of good faith and was told that was "Absurd" As the other post indicates delays are not a new problem and I would suggest it it getting worse. Kevin Wright, the president of Dynasty, said in February 2010 the doors were "being built" and the order could not be cancelled. Three months later he says they have "restarted" the order and will be here with his next shipment.  November 2010 Update: I have recieved my doors - they are first class. Kevin Wright has left the company and the current operators seem to be making an enormous attempt to turn it around. I believe they are earnest and trust worthy.
1 DO NOT ENTER INTO ANY BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS WITH THIS FRAUDULENT COMPANY.  I ordered a door from Dynasty five months ago and am STILL waiting for my door to arrive. I called on numerous occasions to find myself dealing with rude, unhelpful, and incompetent people. The ETA for my door has been pushed back twice already (5 weeks each time). I kept receiving the same response from the "manager." Apparently, they're going through "hard times" and cannot have my door shipped from China. However, I found out today from an employee that they have not even started production on my door. I believe this is a fraudulent company and that I have been scammed.   Be careful!
