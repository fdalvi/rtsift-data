5 Been coming to this restaurant weekly for the last four or five months, and decided it was finally time to write a review.  The service and friendliness of the employees is truly unbelievable . . . it is like walking into "Cheers" . . . Welcome to Papa Murphy's . . . and then "Hi Michael".  We had the De Lite Cheese Pizza and a fresh Garden Salad, and as usual it was wonderful.  We will definitely be back again . . .
5 I admit, I'm a sucker for pizza. I've pretty much had pizza from every place under the sun.  Lately, we've only been eating Papa Murphy's.  How can you not?  Fresh pizza, made to order for a great price.  All in the comfort of your own home.   This location is very clean and bright.  The staff is clean, professional and friendly.  It's all done right in front of you, so you don't have to worry about whether it's on the up and up or not.  There are no secrets here.  My kids like that they can watch their pizza being made right in front of them.  We usually get one of the $5 faves for the kiddos, then something more "adventurous" for us.  We love the Barbecue Chicken and the Cowboy.  We are big fans of the pan variety.   If you have a chance to have the Taco Pizza (it's seasonal), do!  It's delicious!   You can't go wrong with this one.
