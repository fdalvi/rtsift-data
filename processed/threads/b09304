5 I may have just been the luckiest woman in the world to have the best wedding vendors- ever.  Arizona Inspirations Catering was no exception.  This for me was my first and only stop for food.  My husband and I are foodies and so this was a very important part of our wedding.    We had 2 tastings, and they were awesome, but were invited to as many as we wanted to attend.  The food we tried was great and the food at the wedding was better.  Nik and his chef made my day.  I'm searching for another reason to have them cater.
5 Their food and prices are awesome!  They did a fantastic job at my wedding!
