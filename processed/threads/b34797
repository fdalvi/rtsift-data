4 Friday night fish fry- AYCE for about $11.00. I highly suggest making a reservation- this place is packed to the gills. There's a huge bar in the main room, decent bartenders and reasonable priced drinks. We waited about 20 minutes past our reservation because there was a large party being served, but onced we had a drink in hand, the wait was tolerable.   Seated, we were happily surprised to see how efficiently they run their fish fry- the tables were pre-set with a bowl of tartar sauce and a family-sized bowl of cole slaw, plus a basket with several slices of really tasty rye bread.   Three of us enjoyed perch family-style, with fries and it was really good- a lightly breaded well-cooked platter of perch and fries was easy to share with friends.    Looking around, it was a good mix of north and east-siders with an average age of well under 60, on the low side for a supper club.  Can't wait to go back!
4 We had the family style fish fry...very tasty! The food came out quick and the staff was very friendly. Even if we were the only ones there who didn't get a senior discount... Lol also we were sweating by the time we left ... A/C pleaseeeee!?
3 Love: Cheese curds that were definitely made in house, bread was good and fresh and made in house Meh: Most of the meal was pretty meh. Coconut shrimp tasted good but had an odd texture, pretty much everything was just okay. Not nasty. Not over the top excited to go back; nope, just a-ok, doubt I'd want to spend much money here in the future. Hate: Pop music was blaring over the speakers. WHYYYY? Do you not know your target audience???
