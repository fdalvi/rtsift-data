5 Amazing lashes!
5 What a talented artist!  Bonnie has a great eye for making you beautiful.  Whether it is extending your eyelashes, having a glowing tan, or doing your makeup for a photo or special event.  You won't believe it is you in the mirror.  I would recommend her with 5+ stars.  Enjoy your experience, it is well worth it.
5 I started getting my lashes done back in November of 2012 with Bonnie, she is absolutely amazing at what she does.  Bonnie is very informative and answered all of my questions thoroughly.    She has an array of different styles for you to choose from and she also tells you how to take care of them so that they will last much longer.   Hands down this has been my best experience with lash extensions.  If your considering eyelash extensions give Bonnie a try, you won't regret it.
5 I adore Bonnie, she truly is one of a kind.. She goes the extra mile to make you look and feel amazing.. I would not go any where else, a true gem.. She does it all and makes you feel 100% percent comfortable.. I love her..
5 Bonnie takes the time to do an excellent job.  My tan looked like I had just vacationed in Hawaii only better.  It was even and my skin did not feel dry or look fake.
