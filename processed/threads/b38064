2 BMO Harris bought out M&I.  The services got pricier and not as good.  Their online business banking is at least a decade behind in terms of real time data, even the branch employees cannot see things in real time.  If it wasn't for the fact all the folks held over from M&I know me and I can ask questions and get help at the branch level I would have found another bank.
1 BEWARE.. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH BMO.  Erroneous credit file reporting and unhelpful staff.   Shocking drop in quality of service.   My family and I have been happy M&I customers for over 30 years.. but, BMO harris is ridiculous.  I had a bill pay issue that caused bill pay to have to issue a second mortgage payment after the due date.  Harris Bank submitted a 30 day late notice to my credit report, and even though my bill payment service faxed a letter to BMO harries stating that they made a mistake.  The banking portion of BMO Harris removed the late fees, but, their credit dispute department representative I've been dealing with is rude and totally uncooperative.   I'm now stuck with having to file a federal complaint to address the issue, which I'll be doing shortly along with BBB and every other outlet I can find.
1 This is not just for this one BMO bank but for all of them. I had a large amount of $$ in and IRA for 8 years. It was paying  .05%, I had an opportunity  to take the money and place it and get a better return. Upon closing the account a charge of $100.00 for 2 accounts. I would not do business with this Canadian Bank. XXX triple ex from your mind and get out now!
