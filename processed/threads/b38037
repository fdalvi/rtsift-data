5 Came here because of their great deal! 2 pieces chicken and biscuit for 1.99. It's in a sketchy part of town, but the service was good. Usually most fast food places the service is horrible, but this one had great service! Better than a sit down restaurant! I am a huge fan of the honey butter biscuits! They are soooo delicious!!! Wish they still had church's in Hawaii
2 The deals here are impressive, that is for sure. Very cheap.   The chicken is tasty. And so are the biscuits, which no healthy human should be consuming, but what the hell -- one has to splurge sometimes, I suppose.   And this area does not offer much for fast food options with chicken as the primary focus (Cane's nearby, Farm Basket far away, and BFG/Strip N Dip even farther away), or anything really at Church's price-point.   Stuff like a shrimp basket with french fries for 3.59$, the so-called "Big Tex" for 2.49$, and biscuits for 50Â¢ ea.; manager's special of five chicken strips and two biscuits for 5$; et al.  So, why the two stars, E?   I do not know: I have experienced better. It is a really dirty restaurant.   I have seen "animals" that should be "restricted" scurrying about. I have also been to New York City, so it does not make it prohibitive or forbidden to me, but for fuck's sake ....  On the latest SNHD inspection (http://www.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/restaurants/inspections.php), they are rocking the infamous Violation 16, which is exactly what my star deductions are based on ... for those unfamiliar ("pest control").   SNHD still inexplicably permits them, as well as other eateries, to maintain an "A" grade even with the suspect V-16.   Something to keep in mind for those that believe the giant black "A" on the piece of white paper comes with a level of certainty that fuckery like this will not be afoot. - E
