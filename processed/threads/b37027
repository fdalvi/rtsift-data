5 I just went to this place today for the first time and I just love it!  Inside is very pretty and all of the staff was friendly. Also I went at 8:45 in the morning and they open at 8 AM and there was no one there so I was in and out in 20 minutes!
5 This place is amazing! I walked in at 7:55 pm with the paperwork filled out already, since the forms are available online to print and fill out, and walked out at 8:20 pm. I have never been taken care of that quickly...ever. On top of that, they were super friendly and the office is massive! You don't feel cramped at all and the furniture is adorable. I will definitely be going here anytime something is amiss! They WOWed me!  I almost want to get sick again so I can go back xD
5 I was very pleased and when you don't feel good that is hard to do. I love the colors in the waiting room Yellow & Grey. Staff was very nice and DR Urbina was really down to earth felt comfortable talking to him. I just hate those old guys that are text book doctors.... It was a Saturday morning right after they opened.
5 Love it.  Walked in just after 4pm on a Thursday. The place was empty and even better Disney's Hercules was on the tv. Handed in my forms that I had already filled out and waited in the adorable lobby to be seen. This place is very well decorated. You can't even tell that it use to be a blockbuster.  The front staff were two young ladies who were very nice and impressed that I was all prepared with my forms.   The girl who did my pre-screen and blood pressure was charming and the PA Urbina was nice and efficient. I feel good about this place.   As I sit in the room waiting for my prescription I can hear Mulan starting up. Have I mentioned that I love this place? Waaaaay better than UMC Quickcare.  I was in and out in about 20 minutes antibiotics prescription in hand and I do want to point out that business was starting to pick up as I was leaving.
