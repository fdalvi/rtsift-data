4 Helpful and friendly staff on the phone I was looking for balloons but they did not have helium the staff member provided a close alternative
4 Many great items you wouldn't think would be $1. I love going here for school supplies. They have many posters, books, activities, notebooks etc that I use for my classroom. Perfect for teachers who don't like to spend lots of money at the teacher stores.
3 This location is convenient to my office. It's well-lit and clean. They don't accept MasterCard credit cards though - so if that's your method of payment, you'll need Visa or cash.
2 Yikes.  Stopped in here on a Friday night to grab a few things I needed.  5 minutes to find everything and 15 minutes to stand in line and get rung up.  That's a little ridiculous.  They had 2 lanes open, and then a third one opened up and they didn't bother to take the people who were standing in line the longest.  I hate that.  I had the worst cashier ever... SO SLOW!
3 They don't always have everything I am looking for but the store is well kept. It's neatly tucked away in the corner but easy to access. The store tends to be well stocked with typical items but I like that this one doesn't overstuff themselves with holiday junk. Sometimes they need more cashiers though.
5 Went here on a Saturday around 3ish and it was pretty busy. Parking was not an issue though which was good. The store itself is super nice and huge. They have tons and tons of stuff in and of course-at a great $1 price tag. The customer service was nice and I like how you can get balloons here unlike other Dollar Tree stores.
