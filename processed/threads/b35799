1 Literally amazed.  13 days to send out a technician to hook up our new Internet connection.  Believe it.  Couldn't get Cox in our condo building unfortunately, so we're stuck with Century Link - some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced from a service provider.  The only saving grace - the folks on the phone were very nice... Albeit useless and unable to send out anybody to help us out earlier.  Truly amazing.
5 LOVE this company. We have better quality, less expensive and so much more than we ever did with Cox.  I'm glad Cox is no longer the monopoly.
