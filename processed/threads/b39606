5 My Grandson attends Journey Education, we love the school. The best part about Journey is that they care for each and every child. The classes are small and the teachers are wonderful. The tuition cost is lower then most private schools in Las Vegas.
5 My daughter attends Journey and we couldn't be happier. After having a not so great experience at another private school and paying more than triple the price, we were referred to Journey and are so thankful. The class sizes are small, the children get one on one attention, and it truly feels like a family. Thank you Journey for taking such great care of my daughter.
