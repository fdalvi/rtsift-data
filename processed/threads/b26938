5 I live in the area and always order from this Pizza Hut never once have I had a problem. The food is always fresh and hot upon delivery or pick up.
1 The worst pizza hut I have ever ordered from. For example take tonight, I placed an order at 10:20 and it's 11:48pm. The hour+ wait is fine, since the email confirmation said 11:37, but how much longer do they need to dish out a simple order? Especially on a Wednesday? It doesn't make sense. I have ordered before and the same wait times exist. Additionally, the food usually comes cold--stale bread sticks and stiff pizza. I should have known better than to order from this location again, but pizza hut is one of my most beloved placed to order from. Apparently not snymore.
4 The only reason I am rating this so high is the fact they have such quick delivery service. I am from Chicago so the pizza is just ok. Counter people and delivery drivers are always super pleasant.
