5 Grace was very helpful in explaining my options.  Doug showed up on time and was clean and efficient in replacing my windshield.  I couldn't ask for better.
5 Windshield was replaced-short and sweet and to the point.  Cost $215 out of pocket.  I had a crack much larger than a dollar bill so my insurance wouldn't cover it and this place came to the rescue!
4 MDR  was terrific.  I had two cracked windsheilds in two weeks and they were quick and helped with the insurance claim.
