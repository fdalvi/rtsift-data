1 what the heck. I did smog other car from Jiffy smog on rainbow and paid $19.99. But this place charged me $27; $21 for smog and 6 for VIR fee. Whatever.
5 So fast, so convenient, less than 5 minutes from our house doesn't hurt either!!! I was smog tested, paid, and registered at the DMV in less than 15 minutes!!! DEFINITELY  bringing the other cars here and ALWAYS coming here!
1 The person here was one of the most unpleasant people I have ever met.  They wanted to charge me $10 for renewing my registration, which I can do at home, FREE.  Next time, I'll just take it somewhere else.
1 The guy charged me $30 only to tell me afterward that my car didn't pass because the check engine light was on. Thanks jerk, you could have told me that before you charged me the $30! Then I might have come back to you guys in the future, instead I'll go elsewhere and tell all my friends and family to go elsewhere too! A little kindness could have gone a long way in my book.
