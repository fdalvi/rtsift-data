5 Excellent experience, fun, spacious, friendly environment! Will recommend and I will make this my official barbershop, when I'm in Las Vegas!
4 Was looking for a quick cut and this barbershop was close to my house so I decided to try it out. I went on a Saturday and it was kinda busy waited for about 30 mins which is understandable since it's Saturday. Then finally one of the barbers called me over I told him what I wanted and at the end my haircut looked great . It was perfect and it was the style I was looking for. Total price for a cut is $18 cash only. I will return again.
