1 I stopped into this location at 11:30 am. The parking lot was clean and the entry doors appeared clean. I needed to scan my CVS card and this location was convenient to my next work stop. When I entered I looked for the scan machine, it was not by the front register. I looked about the store for signage that might have directed me to this little jewel of a machine. I didn't see any. From experience, I headed to the pharmacy dept, there is usally one in that section. I didn't see the machine. I went to use the restroom, HUGE mistake. The restroom was filthy! (mirrors, sinks, papers on the floor, fecal material on the toilet seats). There were no toilet seat liners available or disposal paper towels. Luckily I carry hand sanitizer at all times. I could not believe how neglected this facility was especially when I associate CVS with health care. This was horrible. I never did find the scan machine and will never go back to this location!
5 By far the most friendly and helpful pharmacy staff in the valley!
4 Addicted to the extra bucks. They keep getting me to come back and buy more.
5 I love this pharmacy! They're always super busy but also amazingly friendly & helpful! They always have my rx and unlike Walgreens, they take a fraction of the time to get me in and out! Even better, I've yet to meet a CVS pharmacist with the odd blend of delusions of grandeur & some type of cowardly laziness, that most Walgreens pharmacists suffer from. Although I'm surrounded by several Walgreens (maybe there a cult? ;-)   ) I'll always take the trip here from now on!
