2 Caution on gas price. This company uses very small print on their low gas price. When you get to the pump is 10 cents higher then what you expect. The print on the gas sign is very small. I would call this deceptive advertising .
5 Best gas station in north Las Vegas. Great food inside. Plus they have a live DJ and taco truck. Check this place out. You'll get the real feel of north Las Vegas.
5 Just one of those little neighborhood niche markets where the employees end up remembering you and it isn't fancy but who needs it to be?
