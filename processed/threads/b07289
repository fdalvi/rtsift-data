1 Frankly, we had several high-valued items taken from us. They took two weeks to move us from Phoenix, AZ to North Carolina. The guys that came to pick it up were straight thugs. They left several phone calls not returned. The delivery guy came later that the date he gave us, which severely inconvenienced us. Our antique dinner table was broken. They left much to want. This was a military move, so if you are military RUN FOR THE HILLS and don't ever agree to work with this company.   My husband and I are disgusted with the services. We were robbed of our brand new, never-been-used Christmas gifts. And we are making it a point to never let another family be treated in this manner again.
1 The people are nice, but the service is just down right AWFUL.  I could go on and on but let's just put it this way, DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1 I wish I could give this company less than 1 star. So far they have taken three times (and counting) as long to move my household goods as my coworker who arived in Tucson at the same time as me. This company is terrible.
1 Wasted 3 mornings of my life claiming to come and give me a quote. 2 no- shows and one last minute cancel. I gave up. Based on the rest of the reviews I count myself among the lucky ones.
