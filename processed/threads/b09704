5 Great nail salon with great services! Linda, the owner is not only a very nice person, but she is a great nail technician. On time, quality service!! This is a hidden jewel!!
5 I have been going to Pearl Nails for the last 5 months.  Today I went in to get my acrylics filled only to find a new owner,  Scott. He is very warm and inviting.  I could tell right away that he has excellent skills with his 17 years of experience.   He is a wonderful asset to our local businesses in the Tatum Ranch area.  I highly recommend him and the next time I need to go in for my nails I will be switching to gels.  Scott specializes in the gel coats and guarantees his work.
2 Ok gel manicure. The whole process took way too long and I was left with nothing special. The awkward small talk really made things that much worse. To top it off it was way more expensive than most of the places I go to.   I will not be returning.
2 I gave this a 2 star because the new owner that did my nails, cut my cuticle & it was bleeding.  Was not happy about that, but he did do a good job otherwise.
5 It's few times you meet such nice individuals and make you feel at home in a nail salon. I get my nails done all over the US as I travel for work and this by far was one of the best I have been to. Scott did an incredible job on my gel manicure Ali g with a little bling and Lee made by pedicure shine. I will now get my nails done here every time and will bring my sisters and friends.
