1 My SUV was overheating. Like almost all the way to H, which everyone knows is bad news. I pull into a parking lot and pop the hood and there's a little bit of steaming. Freaked out, I walk to Meineke and ask if someone will check it out. A guy came out and asked me to pull it in so they could do a pressure test. He was like "Hopefully its just a loose thermostat or hose!" and therefore gave me hope. I wait as they hook up various machines and test. 20 minutes later the manager trudged up, shows me a vial of green liquid and says, "Well, did the tests and your head gasket is blown." !!! I was devastated as he tells me it'll cost over $2,000 to repair. "Well I don't have that kind of cash right now so I'll have to think about this," I tell him. He's like "Really? Yeah well if you want to sell it to me instead let me know."  I drive home, scared my engine is about to blow, trying to figure a budget for a new car and stressed out! My neighbor comes over and wants to check it. "OH...your radiator cap is loose and is spraying water and antifreeze on the engine." He then proceeds to fill my car with 2 gallons of water and some antifreeze and tightened the cap. PROBLEM SOLVED for less than a meal at Chipotle. My car is running terrific. I know its silly but I'm no mechanic so I rely on others to be honest with me. Sorry but as professional mechanics Meineke should have caught that ridiculously easy problem. Instead now they look like crooks who were trying to convince me of an unnecessary repair that would've cost thousands!!! Avoid!!! You're better off going to Angieslist or Craigslist. Seriously.
1 If I could give Meineke ZERO stars I totally would because they are sharks!.  So I hit a curb (this is a regular occurance I don't know why) and I needed to get a front end alignment so I thought.  I brought my car to this Meineke because it was close to my house and driving was getting pretty difficult.  When I called before I went over there I asked how much the alignment was and it was in the ball park of $90.  Ok, sweeet!  No, not sweet.  Sour.  They said it would take 2 hours JUST TO LOOK AT.  So I went over to Bilbo's and hung out there for a while.  Exactly two hours on the dot they call me to go back to Meineke.  They gave me an estimate of $1400 (no effing way) and said that my car was basically going to explode on me if I don't get the 4 things I needed fixed.  I was told that it was "unsafe and possibly dangerous" to drive my car.  Needless to say I didn't have $1400 on me, or even the "minimum" amount of what they were going to do which was $600.  I went home deflated :(  Then my friend suggested Ted Wiens (who I will write another awesome yelp review about).....AND HOLY BANANAS WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  Ted Wiens had my car up on their lot in like 45 minutes and was looking at it.  They even brought me out there to show me what was wrong (bent tire rod).  He said it will be like 2 hours to fix and the grand total?  $285.  Yes.  For Everything.  When I asked the guy about all the crap Meineke said I needed he literally said this: "What?  Are you kidding?  Those A**holes have no idea what they are doing.:"  He then proceeded to show me EVERY part on my car that Meineke said was "so totally badly and completely damaged and unsafe" and they were all fine.  Normal wear and tear.  No need to replace.    I think I hugged him.  Anyway I just want everyone to know to NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER in your life use this Meineke, they will try to get you to spend unnecessary money!
1 I too ended up at this hell hole!!! I ended up having to stand outside (it was 117) with my 6 year old daughter and her 8 year old friend!!! For soooo long!!! I cannot even begin to tell you how hot it was and the girls were just wilting....I was so unimpressed, I cannot express how angry I was at this Meineke shop, and how full of bull they were!!! I swore when I left there I would tell everyone about my horrible experience, hence, yelp.  My husband had to drive across town with the baby to pick us all up, it was truly a nightmare...however, the discount tire by this place was soo soo soo nice. They gave us water and told us to come in and sit, so yes i did go back and get 2 sets of tires (for 2 cars at discount tire)...Meinieke......F that whole place and the owners!!!
4 Fast, friendly service at a reasonable price.
4 Free inspections and courtesy code-reads for dash lights and warnings. I come here to get my car maintenance done even though I live on the complete other side of town. The people here are friendly and knowledgable.
1 They lost me at $50 Oil Change. ..I went in for an oil change....price listed on their services menu at $29.99. Fine. But when I paid it was almost $50. Add on costs- $5 for "parts" and another $10 for "labor." Then there is an addional Disposal Fee as well as taxes. What exactly is included I  the $29.99 Oil Change? Obvioisly not parts and labor. And it took an hour and a half for them to do a simple oil change...on a Wednesday. Give me a break. I will never be back.
5 Honest, fast and friendly! They did a oil changed and helped me with any questions I needed to be answered! I am a young women newer to Vegas so it was nice going into a auto body place and felt like I wasn't being ripped off and got the professional opinions and services I went there for. Also I needed new tires and they even had the guys at the shop next door come over and give me a price! Thank you guys for your fast and honest work!!!! I will be coming back and sending people your way!
5 The new service writer, mechanic, Rocco is great!.  Really nice person, friendly, knows what he's doing and I felt good about leaving my car with them.  They changed my oil, rotated my tires, saw where I had a nail in my tire and helped me with that. I will bring my car there for other repair work that my warranty doesn't cover.  Thanks!!!
