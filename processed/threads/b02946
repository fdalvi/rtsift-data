4 I think my family likes the atmosphere here more than the food, but that's OK. Even though there are always plenty of singles and couples here, the relaxed, friendly atmosphere also works perfectly for families. Get a booth if you can and enjoy your own personal TV complete w/remote control! (If you can wrestle it from your partner, that is). Want more reasons to visit? T1 connection for laptops, outdoor seating, and pool tables and shuffleboards.
3 fun place to hang out for drink on friday and sat nights.
3 For someone like myself who hasn't plugged in her TV for six months, Jilly's is a great place to go for a little television fix. Although one time there wasn't sound, the televisions are great for dinner discussions or for instant distractions when you don't feel like talking  I think the food is fantastic as well, especially the wings. And rounding everything off, the wait staff is very relaxed and friendly.
3 Yawn.  I find this place leaves a "blah" memory in my mind  It's kinda like Half Moon, but with more of a... trashy vibe.  So yeah.  Decent happy hour specials.  Decent-ish bar food.  Eh.
2 My boyfriend and I went in tonight hoping to get some good happy hour drinks, some pub food, and watch the USA - Honduras match on one of their "over 60 televisions." The hostess said that the bar seating was open, so we sat at a high-top table and waited.  And waited.  And waited.   The place wasn't terribly busy, and several servers were waiting on the tables surrounding us, so to not even get an "I'll be right with you" in 10 minutes was a little lame. After a while, the match was already starting (and not displayed on any of the TVs - we were going to ask if we could have one of them changed to the right channel) so we just went across the street and picked up some beer and sandwiches and went home to watch the match.   I'm sure we'll try going again sometime, hopefully we'll actually get to eat there next time.
1 Jilly's was a crappy bar. It closed.
