4 Old College in Edinburgh, is one of my favourite buildings, the dome structure dominates the surrounding area. For years, I had been walking past it, but it wasn't until last year that I got a chance to actually see inside it. And what did I find? I found, one of the best public rooms in Scotland apparently - Playfair Library Hall.   As you enter the court yard of Old College the entrance to the hall is on the left hand side. I was there for the swearing in ceremony of our new rector, and the hall was very ceremonial. It had roman styled pillars, busts of old academics, bookcases housing old books and a very large ceiling. The hall is very big and forces itself upon you with its brilliance!   The hall itself is used for ceremonies and lunches by the universities hierarchy, however, if you get the opportunity to pay this hall a visit then please do so. It is a treasure which is not very well known and needs to be seen!
4 As well as being a functioning part of the uni, Old College is almost a tourist attraction in its own right. For one thing, it's so huge and imposing that without even meaning to you'll find yourself using it as a landmark for directing you to places.  For me, Old College will always stick in my memory as the place I finished my last university exam, so it's not surprising that I'm giving it so many stars! But if you're even vaguely interested in architecture or law (as well as housing several libraries, Old College is also the uni Law School), it's well worth wandering through the quad and taking it in; it's pretty impressive. I think the uni also hire out certain rooms in here for conferences and other functions.
