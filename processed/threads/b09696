1 Ordered breakfast thru the drive-thru for the 5 of us as we headed back home to cali and they forget a breakfast jack and also screwed up on one of the meals. It was just a breakfast jack that i really didnt need though
4 Fast Food has become a necessity with my new position and today's choice was Jacks place.  It's close by and I have not been there in some time so we checked it out....  Never have I been a fan of the drive through so Melissa and I went inside to place the orders even though we were going to take it with us....probably a better choice as the drive through was packed.  Todays choice was the Sourdough Steak Sandwich with Curley Fries and a fountain soda. I also opted to try out their Two-Taco's-For-$.99 deal.  Melissa had the Chicken Fajita Pita combo.   The counter person was Perfcta, although I thought her name tag was different.  She was courteous, efficient and seemed to care that she was offering great service.  A nice surprise in any fast food joint.  My food was delivered quickly and was still quite hote when we arrived back at the office to eat.  The sandwich was actually quite good, a nice change from the satandard everyday burger.  The tacos were a bt greasy and I would say to save this for days when you are broke or needing a hang-over remedy as they will be more like a scoop of Draino to my system!!  Mel says her Pita was great...its seems this is what she always orders as its consistantly the same and always good.  So, whats the rating??  I would go back.  The service was fast, the food was hot and the person behind the counter made me feel valued.  I will be saving the taco's for my next night out drinking!  Enjoy!!
4 great services, great people.
4 Drive thru is slow  I always go inside when open
