1 Not a very good store in my opinion.  The prices are about 15% higher than other stores nearby.  It's fairly clean and service is what you expect from a Walgreens.... Crappy.  I can't stand the check out system of these places and others like them (CVS).  Just horrible.  And the check out process is WAY too long.  Avoid!!!
4 This has to be the most impressive WalGreens store around the west valley.  It's huge and has a great selection of products.  What really stood out is their section that simulates a Circle K or Quik-Trip.  Want an ICEE?  Yup, they have an Icee machine. I even considered buying one of their gourment-type sandwiches/wraps/salad/dessert.  It's a 24 store and has a very well lit cosmetics area.  I can't wait to go back!
5 The staff here are really friendly ( especially Julie)... I've been going here since i moved out here from California in 2007... Love  how clean it is..
5 Store is beautiful and the employees are very helpful!
4 This was the only place open on Xmas eve night.
