4 Legit place to go and get your smoke on. They have plenty of good stuff on sale and for decent prices. It's a smoke shop so the employees are pretty chill.
5 Always look forward to buying new merchandise here. Large selection, quality products, and legit staff. Purchased probably over 400 dollars in products here, and have always been satisfied.
1 Went to see if they had any liquid for my ecig and whoever was there was watching tv with someone on a couch and acted like I was bothering him by coming in and didn't have any knowledge about the products I was looking at. I asked what they were and if he knew if any of them were good and he just shrugged and said "I dunno, I don't use that stuff." I understand if you don't personally use every item in your store, but you should at least be a little more knowledgable about the things you carry and maybe try and act a little more friendly in the future. I don't need sunshine and rainbows, but at least don't look annoyed that I just interrupted what you were doing.  Suffice to say, I won't be returning here.
1 I ended up moving over to Gilbert recently and saw that there was a smoke shop. I dropped in because I had quit smoking and wanted a zero nicotine e cig to help me with kicking cigs. When I walked in I had a guy show me the e cigs. He told me the cartridge was non refillable after the first try, which was really odd. However, I figured I would buy one anyway since I can have two cartridges. Well, they sold me a $16 cartridge that doesn't even fit my e cig. Ridiculous that he blatantly lied to me. Never coming here again.
5 I love this smoke shop so much!!!! Everyone there is always so inviting and nice, and very knowledgeable!! It's a nice play to hang out and kill a few hours!! They have great prices on all their items in the store!! I totally recommend people to shop here, you won't regret it at all
