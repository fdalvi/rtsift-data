4 Glad not to have to drive too far out of Scottsdale for authentic Mexican shaved ice treats. The Chamoyada reminds me of a Bloody Mary on ice - salty, spicy and sweet! Perfect way to cool down on a hot day.
3 Enjoying my strawberry raspados right now, and it's 105 degrees out. Great way to cool down, but the staff wasn't super helpful with the all-Spanish menu.
4 The raspados are soooo good!!! My kids loved them and they are better than ice cream so we WILL be back for more.
4 found them by chance.  I was in the stripmall for another business and saw their signs. popped in and the place was busy!  lots of families, all seated enjoying treats I've never heard of before.   Tositos Preparados, Churros Locos, and some other things.    I tried their sonoran hot dogs as I've not had one in a couple years and they were excellent.  now that the summer heat's here and they're close by i'll be sure to try a raspado.  the melon and peaches and all the fruits looked so delicious and refreshing!
4 When you are missing Mexico this is the place to hit up. Although the treats are not as good as the ones you would find in the state of Michoacan they are still good. I've tried basically everything on their menu, you can't go wrong with this place. So next time it gets 100 degrees and you want a little piece of Mexico, you know where to go!
