5 AWESOME - is how I describe Mary Ann and her color, cut and styling skills!!  She is an incredible stylist at Spirals Salon having moved here from the Bay area where she was in high demand for 30 years.  I'm a professional woman in my mid 50's and Mary Ann took my curly hair from looking like a helmet (which ran over $200 at another salon!!) to a stylish cut with beautiful highlights and lowlights for a fraction of the cost elsewhere.  She has now done my 31 year old daughter from San Diego, my hubby and now my parents who are visiting.  Regardless of age or sex she does a wonderful and meticulous job as demonstrated by my own family.  You will absolutely not regret an appointment with Mary Ann - she ROCKS!!!!
1 Mary Ann has moved on to the Luxe Salon near Simmons and Ann Road thank god.  Mary Ann was the only reason to be going to Spirals Salon. Mary Ann is worth the drive and again you get a professional haricut, styling, coloring, etc. at a very reasonable cost.  Call Mary Ann directly today at 650-269-1291!
