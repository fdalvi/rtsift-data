5 Great Cut, styling and low liGhts very affordable will have you going back again And Again. I have curly hair and the stylist had no problem with it. They give you their expert opinion but will also not deviate from your wishes. Ask for adriana or ricky-there are other sylists there but I haven't tried them. LocAted in unpretentious mall desert sky on thomas rd
1 Horrible,  I walked into this salon thinking they would do a great job.  I have had very long, untreated hair for years and decided to get a perm. BAD Idea.  They put a 20 year old girl to do my perm, no one would help her except the receptionist and when she was done with the so called perm it was a mess.  It was tangled and had no curl in it what so ever. I ended up having to go to another stylist and she let me know the stupid girl put the neutralizer in my hair before the curling formula and my hair would not hold the perm. Thank God a real professional saved my hair. BE VERY CAREFUL when going into this Salon for something serious.  Their customer service is horrible and the so called manager is only worried about the money she plans on making that day instead of fixing a problem they created a day before very unprofessional and very dissapointed.
3 Located inside Desert Sky. The girl who did my hair did it okay but seemed like she'd rather be somewhere else and didn't really seem engaged and helpful. No tip for her. I went with my sister and my sis got a girl who seemed very helpful and offered hair tips and was really sweet. Mine seemed like she wanted to go as fast as she could, didn't care about me or my hair and she didn't even ask me if my hair looked okay after she was done. Cuts are a pretty standard price, every month they have specials which they display near the entrance. Overall a decent place. I think they could have some better customer service. I pass by this place sometimes and I see almost nobody  inside. Might just go to Supercuts next time...
