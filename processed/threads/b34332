4 This place has great Mexican food at great prices.  However, if you are looking for fine dinning or an Americanized Mexican - keep looking it is dive-y.  Many of the items on the menu are commonly discarded cuts of meat, including tongue, guts and head (lengua, tripa and cabeza).  The fact that they have these cuts makes this place authentic.  Also on the menu is pastor, carnitas, suadero, chorizo and bistec... look them up - I did.  I really wanted to keep this secret treasure to myself, but they survive purely on word of mouth so I had to say something.  They also serve breakfast (omelets and breakfast burritos) and  camarones (shrimp) in several ways including a la diabla.  Why not 5 stars... the past two times I was there the soda machine broke down and that is how they serve ice tea.  I gotta have ice tea with my meal.
4 Stopped in for breakfast.  Had the huevos rancheros, and they did not disappoint.  I just wish they had Coke products instead of Pepsi, but otherwise the food is great.
3 Bean & Cheese burrito + pico + sourcream! For those days when you don't feel like meat...... Delish
