4 I was so happy to find Rachel's Kitchen at the airport! In a sea of fried food and pre-packaged questionable looking sandwiches, a healthy option was exactly what I wanted after a week in Las Vegas. Rachel's had a great variety of smoothies, sandwiches, salads, and healthy snacks available. I grabbed a spinach salad for my plane ride-- it was topped with fresh mushrooms, tomatoes, goat cheese, and bacon with an herb vinaigrette and was fresh and actually really tasty. I wouldn't have even known that it was airport food! Will definitely be looking for Rachel's on my next trip to Vegas.
4 Easy to enjoy such clean fresh food. This restaurant would be a great addition to any city.  It is wonderful to have restaurant owners who are responding to our community wanting more organic and healthier choices.
3 Average food, average menu, average everything. Not really a "kitchen" -- more like a smoothie and juice bar with a large grab-and-go case, and some sandwiches. For an airport venue, it has a good presence and benefits from well thought-out branding, although it borders on mom-and-pop just because of the disconnect between the branding and the actual experience. 3.5 stars.
4 A nicer alternative to starbucks overpriced and overrated coffee. Try the organic coffee.
5 The food was great and the service was even better. I was feeling exhausted and couldn't think of what I might want so an employee took me through the menu and her choice was delicious. Thanks again Mimi
