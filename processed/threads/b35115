5 I've been to many Zumba classes across the valley in AZ. Imagine That! is the best by far!! The staff is very friendly. All instructors are supportive and knowledgeable. You are guaranteed to have fun while getting a great workout!
5 I have not been to a Zumba class since I moved to Arizona. I found Imagine that when I was driving by and decided to give it a try. I was very happy to find that the class was challenging and fun. The studio was clean and the instructor was great! She was also very encouraging. The class price was also very reasonable. I am definitely going to be back to get my Zumba on!
