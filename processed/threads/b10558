5 I had previously written a review on the horrible customer service I received upon checking into the hotel.  I wanted to write a follow up, the manager of the hotel contacted me and refunded me an entire night do to my dissatisfaction with the situation.   Both the general manager and the hotel manger reached out to me and were very concerned with their customer service.   After their responses, I will continue to give Marriott hotels my business.  They are also updating the hotel and everything will be new and fresh soon.
5 One of my favorite Marriotts... As a Gold/Platinum you will receive a full cooked to order breakfast, wifi, and a spacious two room suite with French doors.  Parking is free and it's within walking distance of the convention center and Wynn and a High Dollar Mall.
3 Pretty much everything about this place we liked.  Cute suite.  Nice french doors leading to bedroom. Very polite customer service.  Good price.  Decent food from room service. Easy parking. Downside was, for a modern hotel they have no fans in thier bathrooms.  It is so quiet in them, you can hear a pin drop.  So you will want to be sure if your sharing a room here with someone else, that you are at a comfort level to hear all of each others bodily functions happening in the bathroom.  For me, I like privacy in the bathroom, so it made my stay at this room somewhat uncomfortable.
