3 Dr Lianne Ong is on maternity leave so Dr Chua is taking over right now. Waiting time is over an hour and my prescription took awhile before it reached my pharmacy. Went there 3 hours after then called the next day but it's not yet ready. Turned out that their system has an issue and the prescriptions didn't go thru. I had to call them twice and even went there personally before they call and get the prescription thru. Dr Chua took time to deal with my conditions and was okay.  Then I got a bill for something I'm not supposed to pay for. Called my insurance and they said that Cathay Medical had to send back the form they sent to them since my insurance will cover it. Then called Cathay Medical, talked to Jessica and she raised my voice saying she's busy. I'm a patient, right??? and I'm worth "wasting her time". It's a shame but I think I have to switch doctors.
3 Dr Lianne was the best! But unfortunately, it appears that she will not be returning. It is just not the same without her...because she was such an excellent doctor, I could deal with the seemingly always busy tone when calling in the mornings, and the long hold times when you do get an answer.  I have seen both doctors since Dr Lianne's maternity leave and while they are both good, as I mentioned before, it is not the same without Dr Lianne.
5 Love this guy....long wait times..but he is super smart...he is on the money..after 10 diff doctors failed for me...Dr. Ong got me better!!!
