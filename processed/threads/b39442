5 I love this studio!  So. Much. The hang classes (inversions and poses using straps connected to a wall) are great strength builders and not at all as scary as it might sound. Flow classes are equally as enjoyable and challenging.  My friends and I started here as beginners and are completely addicted to the awesome offerings at the Yoga Hangout.   The instruction is the best part, in my opinion.  Rosa's classes are so, so good!  My experience with other instructors is also very positive.  I love that the classes are not overcrowded, the studio is clean, and the playlists vary from the traditional.   The unlimited class pricing is like nothing I've seen before, and unquestionably worth every penny!
2 The secretary/front receptionist ruined my practice every time I dropped in.  I think being horrible must be part of her job description, she is a bitch and she's a bitch to my wife. Totally unacceptable.  I bought a Groupon, had a blast with the hang out classes I want to do more hang out classes but I will not be renewing. On top of that they never have the AC on so you're getting a hot yoga class when you're not expecting it.
