4 This is probably one of the nicer locations of this chain bar (gosh, has to be the biggest chain here). Though it's been a while, I remember this one not being so smoky and the people were a better calibur (sorry, honestly). The servers were nice. The food is pretty good as far as bar food goes (you'd be surprised at how many bars have nasty food, though). The majority of the seating was pub tables and chairs. I don't remember if there was a pool table or other games available. I do remember bumping into an old classmate from college- which if you have been here a while, will come to find out that it's a small world here.
4 This is a regular spot for my husband on his way out of Vegas because - - It's only like 3-4 minutes from the car rental place so it's a good place to stop and have a drink and dinner before heading to the airport. - The servers are super friendly and attentive. - There are several tables with power outlets nearby.  - Food is not anything that you're going to gush over but it's just fine and not too expensive and filling (the nachos are HUGE!!!).  I like this place because it's directly across from the airport and you can watch the planes taking off and landing. They're so close to the building (seriously just across the road and on the other side of a chain link fence) and close to other planes that it's kind of scary sometimes!
5 This is my new favorite bar in Vegas. Sure, it's not as trendy or hipster-infested as some "other" bars in town...but that's why I like it! Unpretentious, cheap drinks and reasonably-priced, good food.   But the main reason I like this particular PT's is that, unlike *other* PT's which are dark, gloomy caves of service industry post-shift misery and alcoholism....this PT's has floor-to-ceiling WINDOWS, letting in lots of natural light and affording an amazing view of the airport runway right across the street.  I find watching planes take off and land to be oddly meditative, and it's very pleasant to sit on the small patio outside this PT's with a drink and some noms while contemplating the mystery of flight.   On a Friday night, it's especially fun to watch the looooong line of planes stacked up on approach into Vegas, coming in one by one like a never-ending line of lemmings jumping off a cliff into a sea of broke degeneracy. Good luck, suckas!
3 Great service. Good bar food. Interesting "regulars"...liked the fact that there was pool tables.
1 This place is getting one star because I liked my food, but the customer service, or lack there of is the reason it's not getting any more.   We were "greeted" at the bar by a scowled face female bartender, and placed our drink order and then placed a food order. She went around the bar (that was all men) and flirted with them but never checked on us. 30 minutes later our food comes out and again we get the scowl face. She couldn't get back to the guys fast enough so they could stare at her fake boobs. Little piece of advice, if you would have treated us better, we would have tipped you better than the trash you were busy flirting with. Doesn't take much to smile and make a customer feel welcome. We ended up leaving after 2 beers because of her, there are way too many local bars around to be treated like you're an annoyance.
5 I love this PT's location. I have been to other locations and they aren't nearly as nice or have as good of an atmosphere. You can't beat the 50% off all bar drinks happy hour. Good draft selection and full bar. All the food there is good, particularly the pretzel bites, steak salad, turkey sandwich, burgers, and curly fries. Not the biggest fan of their pizza because it has a cracker thin crust, but when you are drunk put a little ranch on it and for half price it is worth sobering you up.  Very nice atmosphere. Bright with nice comfortable chairs. Lots of TVs. Mostly good service, like all places it depends on the day and whose working but we have had more amazing service than poor service.  This is our go to comfy sit and watch the game and have a few mugs of beer and food we look forward to bar.
4 I work in the area so I've been to this location twice recently and I have to say its becoming a favorite.  I like that it has high ceilings and lots of windows - light is a good thing even though this whole damn city doesn't seem to think that.  Its also right across from the airport so you can grab a table by the window and watch the planes go by.  I always appreciate an interesting (and free) view.  The food has been pretty good but the service really needs improvement.  I do have to say that the waitresses I've dealt with were very nice but very slow.  I don't know if they need a busboy for backup with drink refills/silverware/condiments etc or another waitress to handle the amount of customers but it does seem to take longer than it needs to for e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g.  Oh, and I don't know if this place is nonsmoking but the 2 times I've been there I haven't smelled smoke at all.    Can anyone else confirm whether this location is non-smoking?  All in all I like this place but you may want to avoid it if you're in a rush to be anywhere (like to catch a plane for instance...)
3 nice location nice pt's......very average service
1 Normally I don't review chains. Chains are what they are and you know this going in. For example, you go into PT's, you know you're going to get decent food, decent drinks, and at a decent price. You know they're open 24 hours, which is their selling point, and they're all over. So if all of them are the same, it really boils down to their service that determines if they live or die.  This PT's just flatlined.  We came in, were greeted fairly quickly, got our drinks (we didn't have alcohol, we were both a little on the tired side), and placed our orders. Maybe it was because we didn't have alcohol, but the food took a bit of time to come out. Not a HUGE deal.  So my friend and I are talking the soap opera of my life, when we realize we've demolished most of the pizza and our drinks haven't been refilled. The guy hasn't even come by. So we try to flag him down, and it literally takes 20 minutes to get some refills. Annoyed, we wait for the check. After 30 minutes, he finally notices us... then it takes another 15 to get the bill. I wanted to walk out... that kind of wait time is totally unacceptable. Sorry I wasn't boozing it up for once. Sorry I didn't have big ol' tits like the tarts at the bar. But I'm still a paying customer and demand a modicum of respect.  I'm pretty easy to please and hard to piss off, but this gone and done it.
4 Lemon Pepper Wings hands done---- and happy hour drinks  LUV it Luv it
5 I been coming to this bar for 2 years and it has to be one of my favorite spot to have a drink.  I have met great people here, the bartender is great, and happy hour is always the best.  Compare to other PTs I have been too this has to be far the best.  Weather your coming to watch some good football, grab a bite to eat, or just chill with some friends play some pool and enjoy a great time I highly recommend this place.  Especially on Fridays, and Saturdays evening come on down for Happy Hour.  Thank for reading and enjoy.
3 Super close to my house and I enjoy the atmosphere but tte service is lacking !
4 This location is by far, one of the nicest PT's Pubs I've been to.  It's in an odd industrial, airport runway across the street-like, location, but I look at it as a gem in the middle of town :)  We came here tonight to celebrate the move of a dear friend.  When you walk in, you are reminded that the bar is and will always be the center focal point of this location.  The lighting is elegant and the smell of cigarettes isn't overpowering.  There's ample seating all around the bar and tables around the restaurant.  We took our party in a small nook in the middle of the restaurant, equipped with TVs and a fireplace.  Super cozy.    I enjoy their tall drafts of beer.  It's about 5 dollars and for me, lasts a long time.  For the party, we were treated with wings, fries and a pizza.  The pizza was a buffalo chicken pizza and the wings and fries were covered in Parmesan cheese. The bone in wings were somewhat crispy, somewhat soft.  Garlic Parmesan offered a lot of flavor and so were the fries.  I loved the pizza soo much!  Imagine having buffalo wings but in the form of a pizza.  So much flavor.  Little bit of spice, little bit of tang, little bit of heaven.    If you're in the area, you should take a little stroll and visit this PT's.  If you're ever familiar with PT's, which if you're local, you probably are, then you will love this location.  Although PT's is a chain bar restaurant, this location is one that will impress above the others.  Enjoy!
4 "A Wing and a Prayer"  I've always enjoyed watching airplanes. It's escapist. Hypnotic. Like a well written novel about non-existent worlds. I gaze at runways and make up stories about passengers. Good tales, bad tales, but never in between....  I came here last week after work. Needed a beer after a bad day.The weather was cool, cloudy; the scent of rain in the wind.   I parked and walked across the empty lot.  Inside, I approached a large bar. Rectangular in shape, it might be the largest counter in town. Light brown with video poker machines, each stool offered views of screens showing sports.  But I didn't have any interest in that. Not today. I needed to be alone. And I knew where I wanted to be.   I ordered a brew from a lady in the rectangle. Thrusting change in my pocket, I left a dollar behind and headed outside.  Cars whizzed by, oblivious to my presence. Across the road, seven jets waited to be cleared for take-off. Allegiant, Delta and United. A Fedex and UPS jet sat beyond. I plunked down on a stool just as a Southwest airliner glided in for a landing not 500 yards away.  Wind mussed my hair as I honed in on the landing jets' windows.   There's a woman on there, I thought. Alone. From the midwest. Missouri, perhaps. Needs money. Husband died. Left her with nothing. Has no skills other than housewife. Has looks, though. Not many lines on the face, either. A friend said she could make money dancing. Couple grand a weekend if things went well. Maybe more if she was willing to escort.  The plane landed with a screech of burning rubber. "Good luck to you, dear," I whispered, "I'll say a prayer for you." I sipped my drink and stared through the mist.  A few stories later I went back for a refill. This time I stayed inside and sat by the fireplace in a leather like chair. A nice warmth emanated from the flames and I looked around at plentiful seating for diners and two pool tables for gamers. A nice place, I thought. Comfortable. Clean. Friendly. I like it here. I looked to my left to the airfield. Five Southwest jets were lined up just so, waiting their turn.  Draining my beer(a Fat Tire draft if you were wondering), I moseyed back to my car. Patrons had arrived after me and the lot had filled. I doubted they would sit in inclement weather and spin yarns like yours truly, but this PT's had plenty more to offer besides fodder for twisted imaginations.   I'll be back again for sure. Perhaps next time I'll tell you the tale about the man on the Japanese airliner. The one with a wife in the states and another in Nippon, each of whom is independently plotting his demise....
4 My cousins are regulars here. I loved how they knew the bartenders (Manny and Sean) and I felt more comfortable that my family trusted them. The drinks were good, the food was yummy, and I won during my poker game. All pluses for me.  Anyway, I've only been here twice, both times for short periods. I really wished I could have stayed longer because I love the atmosphere and the workers are always so nice.
2 I lived in Vegas for over fifteen years and used to go to this location from time to time, and also many other P.T's throughout Las Vegas over the years. I always liked this particular location because of the views of the runways. Also, this location always seemed clean and virtually smoke-free....relative to other locations. I now live in South Florida and was waiting for my flight back to Miami on a Saturday night, so I stopped at this P.T's for two beers and some food before returning my rental car. Long story short - the beer was twice what it was a few years earlier....and the philly cheese steak was a complete rip-off. I thought it was a joke when the girl brought it to me. I was starving, so I didn't say anything, but it was half the size they used to be....and had yellow "Velveeta" cheese on it, with no onions and only a few specks of bell pepper. Aren't they supposed to use Swiss on a philly? It was basically nothing but bread, and I only got about five fries with it. The bill was something like $25...plus tip. $30 for a snack?? I could have eaten at the airport cheaper than that! The waitress was cute and attentive, but the place was empty. I think I was her only customer. I hate to have to rag on businesses and be a whiner, but enough is enough. How much money do these places have to make anyway? Like they don't make enough on gambling and liquor, the have to ream you on crappy food too?   Two stars only for the view.
1 Horrible!! Asked for a menu, waitress came back an hour later! Only 6 other people in bar.
1 The only reason I come here is because friends like to, it's a well known local bar. I also love Shannon and Heidi for their great personality and service. What I don't like is that the other bartender, Amy, who is also the manager apparently. She is rude, unprofessional and down right non-service oriented. How a person can act this way and become a manager in a service industry is beyond me.
