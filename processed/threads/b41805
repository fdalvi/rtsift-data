5 I can't shut up about this place!  I had seen Copper City Bourbon around, but had not yet tried it.  Rodney was at the Yelp Downtown Revival party - I was bummed the bourbon was all gone by the time I got to him, and all he had going was the gin. Not a gin fan at all, he sensed my disappointment and pulled a smaller bottle of whiskey out for me to try.  It.Was.Amazing!!! And - not available in stores - to get it, I'd have to go to the distillery in Tempe.  I did that (with Robyn N.) on Saturday after a huge and wonderful lunch - and am so happy I did!  The place is a bit confusing to get to - I'd suggest calling first and asking directions. We really weren't sure we were in the right place.  We met up with Jason, Rodney's partner and the master distiller.  The bourbon is good. Really good. But that whiskey - WOW! And - get this! Not only is it distilled here, but the wheat is grown near Casa Grande! Totally AZ business!   I've been telling everyone at work, all my friends (in person, on phone and Facebook) about this stuff. I've invited people over to my place to taste it. It really is THAT GOOD!  Super nice guys, with a great product! (Oh, and I hear the gin is good, too!) Jason tells us they are hoping to expand and take over the little complex they're in. When this happens, not only do I hope they'll open it for parties, I'd LOVE to see a Yelp event here!
5 My sister and I took our parents on a private tour for my Father's Birthday this year. I cannot say enough about how wonderful their Gin is! Jason took the time to discuss not only the process but the history as well. Thank you Arizona Distilling.   It feels great to be able to keep it local when ordering a drink out!
5 I took the tour here with some friends and we were blown away with the fun and great spirits to taste. We learned a lot about the history of AZ spirits and culture. I totally recommend this to any group of friends to do.
