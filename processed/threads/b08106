1 I went into get a copy of my test and was informed that it would take 7-10 days to get a copy of a test that I DID 7 months ago? Huh? Everthing was fine according to them/result and I offered to wait, until Dr. Mikel was free to review my notes and release them. I was then, told that he might not even get to my chart today.... Geez . Needless to say, I won't be back. But if you have plenty of time to waste, definitely go there.
5 I have been a pt of Dr. Mikel for several years just for my annual care. I just had my 1st baby and can not express how wonderful Dr. Mikel and his staff are. I had a difficult pregnancy, especially during the last 2 months. I was seen 2x a week and Dr. Mikel explained my work situation with his staff. They always got me in on my lunch break, even if they were already booked. Everyone was so compassionate and caring. His medical assistants where there to help comfort me when procedures where done, when my husband could not be there. Dr. Mikel always told me what was going on and did everything he could to ensure a healthy baby for my husband and myself. The hospital care and after care I received from Dr. Mikel was extraordinary. He came everyday I was in the hospital, even though it was his weekend off. I will continue to see Dr. Mikel in the future.
1 While I'm sure this doctor is knowledgeable in his field, he's not that great with his bedside manner. My first time meeting him, he gave me a huge lecture about me taking anti-anxiety medication, which was prescribed a month earlier-that I hated anyways.. He never talked to me about it, just ridiculed me and told me to do yoga. Really? He doesn't keep track of what he tells patients, and what he goes over at each visit- and he uses the electronic medical records which makes it easier.           The last and final visit, I show up about 10 min before my appointment. I had to wait for 45 minutes with no apology or explanation. After being brought back to the room, I can hear him outside the room with his staff talking about his black Friday shopping for 10 min! So weird, and so over it. See someone that actually cares.
