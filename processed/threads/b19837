2 During a visit to Leith I happened to visit the Middleton Bar. And most likely I will not be visiting it again.   After myself and a group of friends finished our first round of drinks, we quickly decided to move on. The reasons behind this were numerous. The pub was only inhabited by various elderly men, who seemed to mumble and only drink Tennents lager. Additionally, they kept staring at us, a very unwelcoming stare at that. The bar looked run down and didn't particularly smell nice.   As a frequent visitor to local pubs, I don't mind going into the local 'old Man's' pub, but this place really had seen better days, it certainly was on its decline.   However, as I walked past it this week, to my shock, this bar was in the midst of getting a makeover. Oh yes, the interior walls were getting repainted, and the place hopefully will get a general freshen up! A freshen up that this place truly needs!
3 I came to this bar with a friend for a pint before going on to watch a Hibs game. it was very very crowded as you would expect due to proximity to the stadium. however the staff were pretty efficient and served as quick as they could and the wait wasn't as long as I had expected at first. The pub seems to be hugely popular with the away supporters which is good as it allows the chance for the home and away supporters to have a friendly chat with each other and banter about the predictions for the forthcoming game. There were a section of locals in the pub and they seemed very friendly towards all the 'new' guests. I would come here again on a match day, but could not see this being my type of place on any other day.
2 I call in here as little as possible. The bar staff are tone faced. Its a working mans pub. Regulars dour faced. No sky TV, no atmosphere, no food. The only redemption I can think of is,there are two exit doors. Not for me I'm afraid.
