1 Place is in a convenient location for me been here a few times, never had a good experience.don't know why I go back numerous times. Once I dropped off a blazer for a stain to be taken out, came back to pick up on date and item wasn't ready. Went in to patch up a pair or jeans, the guy told me it would be $5 when I went to pick it up the lady told me 10$ . And, I told her someone told me $5. She blankly stared at me. The patch didn't even last a week on my jeans. Then I went in another time to get a button up shortened and they completely ruined the top with a hem I could of done myself.
1 Went there about 10 times for cleaning as well as alterations.  Cleaning was fine but alterations were disappointing. They didn't do an original hem on my jeans and I was pretty clear about what I wanted. They lost my business, there is better elsewhere, keep looking.
4 I want to give Fany's Tailor and Cleaners five stars. I really do. But half the time I come, they have to go and manually search for my clothing because they don't have them organized on the rack very well. I've had them hem six pairs of pants, fix a dress, and they do all of my dry cleaning. I feel they've done a great job and truly, the "not being able to find my clothes sometimes" is my only complaint. The service they provide is otherwise excellent.
5 I had a difficult hemming job for a party dress. Fancy did a great job. The dress looks wonderful.
5 Awesome seamstress! Great customer service and prices!
