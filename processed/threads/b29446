5 This is seriously must be the best Chinese restaurant in Waterloo. The dishes are very nice and homely. You can go as group and order a few dishes to share. Good for home sick students if this is how you are used to eating at home.  Just awesome!
3 Quite a large menu. I was more so impressed with the depth of their vegetarian section, featuring soy chicken, ham and seafood. I had the Kung Pow "Chicken" it cost around $8.50 but you would need some rice or noodles on the side. I found the imitation meat to be very soft and doughy tasting. It was pretty average in the vegetarian section but my meat eating dinner guest weren't overly impressed with their dishes either.
4 Very good take out chinese food. Reasonably priced and we got tons of food. We were very happy with our order. I belive we had the take out special for 4 and it was around 45 delivered. Delivery was very quick
4 A long-time staple for delicious Chinese food in the community.  Their food was hot and fresh. The red sauce is delicious.  The chicken balls actually have a lot of chicken; they're not all breading.  The chicken fried rice was great.  The breaded shrimp were good, like a light tempura batter.  The egg roll was stuffed with a lot of stringy vegetables and no meat, which was unfortunate.  A must try!
