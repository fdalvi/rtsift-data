4 I like this place mainly because they are open early on Sundays & Saturdays and in walking distance to Breakfast Restaurants. I usually drop my car off for an Oil Change and then walk up to Yoli's Caf√© or Brunchies. The staff is not the friendliest but they get the job done without all the extra gimmicks and annoying upsells. The price is a little higher than what I like to pay but the convenience is worth it. If you plan on waiting in the office for your car to be ready I suggest you use the bathroom before you come here and bring a book or Ipad. There is a TV in the waiting room but it's really small and usually on a sports channel.
2 I purchased Firestone tires in New Jersey and have the "nationwide warranty" that I paid extra for. I had a flat and went in to get it fixed here and they charged me 21.47 to put a patch on my tire. The do not honor the Firestone warranty. The service was fast and good but I was not happy with the warranty situation. Whats wose is they have a HUGE sign in the waiting room that advertises the nationwide warranty.. BS
