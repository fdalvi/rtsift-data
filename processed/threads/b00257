5 Only place around that I can get no ethanol gasoline.
5 I hate to let a good secret out but these folks not only work on lawn mowers but have a trained and certified BMW mechanic on staff.  They were fast, did excellent work and were totally affordable and when fixing a BMW affordable is rarely a word used.  They work on other cars as well but I can't speak to that.  They also we t over my car and let me know what preventative work will be needed and about how much time I had to get it done.  Being new to Madison I was worried about finding a mechanic I could trust.  I'm not worried anymore.
5 To keep it short and to the point: I have a 1999 BMW 323i and have been going to Adam's BMW Repair (Wayne's Auto) for the past 2 years. Adam and his dad, Wayne, are nice, helpful, and very down-to-earth. Adam is a certified BMW mechanic who also worked for Zimbrick BMW. He's honest, respectful, and does great work. Just like the previous reviewer, I am reluctant to share this information but I figured why not.
