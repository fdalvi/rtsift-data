3 Good Service, consistent "Denny's Style" food prep and what appears to be a well managed franchise store. the wait persons were very attentive and happy. The whole experience was a pleasure.  Nothing much more to say...
5 Wow, the seven thousand four hundred and ninety third Denny's ever built, impressive.  Denny's. the place I visit more frequently than I should. The place I'll probably meet my soulmate, and probably the place where I'll die. This is what life is all about. Pancake pups, Oreo blender blasters, build you own chicken fajita things. Yeah the good stuff. Thanks for always being there Denny, through thick and thin we have had some great times.
4 Good Dennys with decent staff. Sometimes get a rude female waitress, but its whatever. Other than that, great atmosphere and good food.
5 Friendly environment, what can I say? Food is great, service is great, staff is great, makes a Denny's complete!
1 Probably one of the worst Denny's we've experienced, and we have been to close to one hundred different Denny's. The decor, while diner-style and well done, it was dirty and neglected. Blinds had months of dust and dirt. Ceiling tiles showed water damage sagging. Even though only 6 patrons were present, it took over 20 minutes to get our order, and mine was not as requested. The waitress was more interested in chatting with her friends behind the counter than ensuring our drinks were refilled. I had to get silverware and place mat from another table. She met minimum standards of professionalism and friendliness. Won't return.
