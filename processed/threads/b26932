5 Today was a great shopping day! If you sign up for the email specials, incredible deals come your way. I received an email this morning for the Signature Lotions for $5 each. They are normally$12.50 each so I saved $7.50 a bottle. Time to stock up so back the truck up, baby! I spent a small fortune, but saved a large fortune in the long run. I felt like a thrifty genius this morning.
5 We love this store! They have lots of cool fun things for your home. I love going in there to buy gifts for family members because you can definitely find some unique items. The employees are always so nice and helpful.
