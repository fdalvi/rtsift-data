5 I don't even know where to begin with this review..I have nothing but good things to say about this place. Dr.Goldman's a saint!! I've taken my dog teddy here many times and he's always patient and gives his honest opinions and never tries to add unnecessary things to get more money out of the visit. Everytime I call and have a question his staff nancy and Jill will stay on the phone and talk to me to give me advice. What other vet does that?!They will cut you right off and try and get you in there! Today dr.goldman performed a surgery on teddy and me being the concerned parent I am, I was a little worried but Dr.Goldman took great care of him as always. And when I went to pick teddy up he came out running and chasing a cat throughout the clinic like he hadnt  even had a surgery. So grateful for this place and not to mention the prices here are like half of what other places charge. Sometimes more. Seriously!! It's obvious Dr.Goldman & his staff truly care about animals and a place like this is rare & hard to find..so glad I've found it!!
5 This is the best Vet in town!!!  The doctor is so knowledgeable and actually looks and touches your dog for diagnosis.  The staff is incredible.  I will not take my pets any where else ever!  The pricing is very very fair.  An extra plus, is the staff is funny and caring.  Great experience during a very difficult time.  Alma
5 Highly recommend anyone to go here!:) the staff is really nice and Dr.Goldman is a very good doctor and he's honest,prices are also reasonable. He saved my dog did surgery on her and I'm so thankful for his work!
