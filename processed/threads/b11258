5 Very friendly service! Fast and conveniently located. Was submitted to dmv before I left
5 I love using the expression "quick and dirty" and Smog Checkers really fit the bill, except replace "dirty" with "simple."  While "quick and simple" doesn't sound quite as sexy as "quick and dirty," when it comes to having a smog check done on your auto, it's much better.  I slipped over to this wee building (seriously, it's the size of a closet!) on my lunch break, and was on my way in probably less than 10 minutes.      I pulled up and while I didn't see anyone in the wee building, within about 15 seconds a fellow came out of a nearby building, more than willing to do my smog check.  I guess he likes to duck into the cooler buildings of the strip mall during the hot months, but he keeps a sharp eye out for customers so if you pull up and he's not there, just give him a second or two.    Not only was he quick, but he (I wish I'd gotten his name!) was so nice!  He chatted with me pleasantly while he worked and before I knew it, I had my certificate and was on my way.  Only $19.99 too!
