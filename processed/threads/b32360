4 If you are busy and cannot go to any farmers' market, you can visit them in Town Square next to Tommy Bahama's. It is a tiny shop that is reminescent of the boulangeries in France. The whole store is no bigger than a 10x10, but is filled with bountiful goodness.   Upon entering, we were greeted with a choice between two samples of bread. Today's choice was between the feta and the raisin walnut. I tried the latter and it proved that a good bakery will not fail you with a fruit and nut based loaf. The crunch of the crust and the soft spongy center was magnificent. The generous amount of raisins sprinkled throughout makes me anticipate cutting into the one that I bought.  I ended up picking up a cranberry multigrain loaf for later. Just a light squeeze proved that it was going to be good.
5 White Chocolate Batard (which was turned into french toast with caramelized bananas)...$6.50  Manchego Batard (special loaf of the day) ....$3.00  Using the Yelp Check-In for a free baguette (which was used for my "Better than a Bobbie" sandwich).....PRICELESS!  So happy they opened up shop in Town Square :).....ALOHA!!!  YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(97/365) "Bon Bread = BOMB Bread"
4 I always wonder, how much bread do you need to sell to pay rent at Town Square? I ask this every single time I walk by. And every single time, I wander in, I end up buying 2 loaves. . Bon Bread is a legitimate contender for best bread in Las Vegas. But the brutal truth is everyone LOVES and HATES carbs. Kind of the feelings that dentists deal with everyday of their lives. And somehow, both still exist in the world.
5 Fantastic bread! We'll definitely be returning here for more tasty carbs.
