3 Great food, but way over priced. $17 per meat entr√©e..wouldnt be against that if it were in a nicer place, but it's seriously a hole in the wall joint and mainly went there because every other Korean restaurant I was searching for was closed down. Probably won't be back.
4 While the place was a bit expensive I thought the service was great and the food was phenomenal. I will definitely be returning and recommending this hole-in-the-wall to friends anytime they are looking for delicious Korean food.
4 Food quality was more of a three star, but because of service and since it beats out the korean restaurants around the strip, I'll give it another star.  I wouldn't come here if you're looking for korean BBQ, it's a bit expensive and little.  However, if you're looking for a decent korean home food it's good!  The Mae-oon tang (spicy soup? Not sure what it was called in English on the menu, oh and definitely share this one, it's big) and bibimbap in the stone pot is good. They have pork cutlet and you can't really go wrong with it. I actually enjoyed their fried dumplings too.  I had the sulung tang (beef bone broth with brisket) which was decent.  I wouldn't say it's the best, but being korean visiting the strip, I would go here for a meal
