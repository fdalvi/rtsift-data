5 This Chase bank is outstanding!  Their customer service is always very pleasant.  I have always been greeted at the entryway.  They have lots of employees so you really don't ever wait too long.  The bankers are extremely helpful whether a screwed up account or just notarizing a document...they really strive to make the customer happy.  I think this may be the best banking location I have ever 'banked' with!  If I can't accomplish what I need on-line, I rarely call Chase's annoying automated line, it is honestly easier and more pleasant to come in here!  Oh and they have suckers :)
4 Great staff.  Lori is all about customer service, management seems nice.  I normally dislike Chase as an institution, but this location is an exception to the rule.
3 I would not feel safe using the ATM late at night.  Even thought there are lighting around the ATM and 2 cameras near-by, it still feels a bit weird going there at night.  The branch also need to have more parking spaces as near-by restaurants took the spots when it's suppose to save for the bank customers.
