5 Dr. Mitchell and his entire staff are fantastic, they are friendly and professional!  Dr. Mitchell is brilliant at what he does, and as a patient you reap the rewards of it!  He has helped me and would strongly recommend him and his staff for any chiropractic or physical therapy needs!
5 Dr. Mitchell combines adjustments with massage and physical therapy.  If you're looking for a chiropractor that knows his stuff, you found him!
5 I just can't say enough good things about Michael Mitchell at Desert Mountain Spinal Care Shea. If your looking for a Doctor in the North Scottsdale area who knows how to take care of athletes, your search is over!! Reliable, Experienced, Knowledgeable, Professional, Convenient and MOST importantly- A nice guy with GREAT staff!! Thanks Doc for all your help the last 2 years. Feels so good to be on the mend.
5 I have never been a chiropractor fan.  Too many bad experiences.  But my daughter worked here briefly and convinced me to go.  For the first time in 15 years, the pain in my lower back and leg stopped!  AND he gave me great advice and easy exercises to KEEP the pain away.  He doesn't nag me to go in every week, just when needed.  I am just amazed.
