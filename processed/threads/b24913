3 Lady s at the office aren't the smartest bunch but have good intentions. Make sure if you park over night here that your car won't get towed!!!!!!!!!!
2 Have to give this two stars.. Models look nice! Spacious apartments... We almost moved in but, i was way to fearful of the broken gate because, this nice complex is surrounded by horrrible complexes and trailer parks.. Office lady needs to stop calling me... I don't want to move in after i scoped this place out at night and it wasn't pretty... Also, we found a nice house in a nice area for cheaper...
5 I love this little community. It's is only 96 units so it is very peaceful and quiet. The pool and the spa are open 24 hours and the gym as well. Always have cold water in the gym and even though it's small it's never too crowded. It is also a gated community. The apartments are huge on the inside, I love the kitchens and the laundry room and each unit with full size washer and dryer. And the freezers also have ice makers! The patios are great! It's definitely a hidden gem!
