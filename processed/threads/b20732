4 Muffins Coffee House has been here for years and I used to pop in for a cake with my gran when I was younger. It has a nice friendly atmosphere, has a cute name and has a great selection of cakes to choose from. You can take your cakes away with you or you can sit in and have a cup of tea or coffee if you're looking for a more relaxing afternoon.  In addition to cakes, lunches are also available here and there's always a good choice of goodies on offer.
4 This place was just so cute. It was really old fashioned which I like, the quality is so good and they don't,t feel the need to do some fancy and inappropriate refurbishment which I respect a lot. I had a beautiful homemade potato and leek soup and then a coronation chicken salad. My mum liked her brie and apple panini too. Yummy.
