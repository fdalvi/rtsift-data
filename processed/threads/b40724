5 I had heard about this place being open and hadn't seen it yet. So I stopped in for some wire and wick. Friendly staff seemed knowledgeable. Sat at their flavor bar for little while and tried 10 different flavors. Nothing really set well with me, but matter of opinion I guess. Was a very nice shop for up-and-coming business. Prices were a little high but not nothing unexpected. They really do need something else on the wall other than a TV though. I'll go back and support the small business. Nice alternative on the side of town
5 Great friendly staff. Good selection on juices as well. Price on juices are slightly cheeper then their competitors. Definitely my new favorite store.
5 I have visited many vapor shops in the valley and can say this place is the best I have been.  The guy behind the counter, who I think was one of the owners, was extremely helpful in assisting me with choosing a new set up to replace my old one. I did have some compatability issues with what I wanted, but they had no problem with finding a system that suited my needs. I have found, with many vapor shops, a theme of pretentiousness, but these guys are easy to talk to and they want to make you happy. I am very happy that such a great place is close to where I live.
5 This place is awesome! Went with another person and we ended up loving this place. The whole staff was ridiculously helpful & kind. They made us feel welcome there. Their juices are my favorite. Waiting on their unicorn, but it's worth it!!! My favorite flavors are Tigers Blood, guava blitz & sour skittles! I'll never ever ever never go to another vape shop ever. This place is chill.The owner was nice as hell too. SUPER affordable. You'd be a dumbass not to go check this place out.  Vype vapor is my favorite now :)
