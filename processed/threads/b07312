4 This business is hiding in the back of Park Central Mall but the baked good are killer!  The cinnamon rolls are really homemade tasting and really big for the prices they charge.  Their sandwiches are very good if you are looking for a quick lunch.  I really like their brownies too!!
5 CIINA-BEAR is located in Park Central Mall. It is a hidden gem, hiding inside of this outdoor mall. They having amazing muffins, made from SCRATCH on the premises! (unlike Starbuck's pastries). The muffins are oversized which you can easily ill up on one. It doesn't stop there...They also serve lunch items. The specials change daily. I highly recommend this little place tucked away inside Park Central Mall. They are only open Mon-Fri though, and close at 4 pm. You order at the window & you can eat at the nearby tables or just have it to go .  :)
4 Bread. This is good bread based food. I am big on the bagel dog and get one when I train at Interface.  The rolls are more than a medium to get sugary frosting in your mouth, the roll is great bread. The brownies and other treats that make your mouth thank you.
