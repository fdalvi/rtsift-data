3 Nice and convenient for quick groceries or toiletries in the West Wash neighborhoods.
1 Went here to get check out some sales they had going on.  While there I decided to check with the pharmacist on some things.   He seemed really lazy and disinterested.   Acted like a know it all.   What's up with that? The aisles are set up nicely and the entire store is very neat and clean.  They seemed a bit understaffed compared to a Walgreens.   Parking was somewhat awkward.  I found a spot behind the store off the street and there is a side door to enter from the lot.  Wheelchair accessible. Bought a few of the sale items and left.   Won't be back here.
5 You people who rated this a 2, what are you expecting in a pharmacy? It's a pharmacy! It has pharmaceuticals, groceries, makeup, what is missing? There's even a cute pharmacist! So, bonus!
1 I was super excited that there was a convenient place that I could upload photos on the internet and pick up the prints later. They were a bit pricey, but it was worth it for the convenience.   Unfortunately whatever system they have for printing photos, involves leaving the prints out in the open. My co-worker recognized some of my photos sitting in their machine and picked them up. When I went to pick up my photos, there were some missing. Do not print your photos here.
3 Let me start by saying that I live above this location, so regardless of service or quality, I would probably still visit this store for convenience alone.  I've seen a variety of experience at CVS.  The people that work there are pretty nice, so no complaints there.  One time, the photo machine was broken, so they told me to come back in an hour. When I did, it was up again and I was able to print.  Many other times, they've helped me find items in the store and been knowledgeable about their current promotions and specials.  Overall, I think CVS is a bit overpriced compared to other stores, but their convenience makes up for it.
