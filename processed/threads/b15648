5 I liked Dr. Miller a lot. She took the time to get know me and answer all my questions. Since she knew I was a med student, she not only gave me tons of free samples and waived my copay. I highly recommend her if you're looking for a great obgyn. Her office staff is also really friendly.
5 I have been seeing Dr. Miller for 2 years, and going to her office for 6 years (seeing the nurse practiioner).  The Horizon Ridge office (they have a 2nd on Cimmeron) is always busy, and the waiting room is a bit smaller than the Cimmeron office, but nicely decorated, comfortable, and easy to park and get right in (very important when 6+ months pregnant).  Staff is accomadating, but you get whe you give....meaning...if your nice to them...they are nice to you.  Whenever I had morning appointments (before 10am), I was in and out quickly.  Afternoon appointments seemed to be habitually late (20 min in waiting room, 10 to 15 in exam room), so try for an AM appointment if possible.  Dr. Miller seems to only see new patients once your pregnant, and if you are coming in for an annual you more than likely will be advised to see the Nurse Practitioner.  Once you are in Dr. Miller's care, she is great!! she listens, and is there "in the moment" with you.  She was always there to answer any questions, and didnt' rush me out of the exam room, once she is there...she is yours.  We ended up having an emergency C-section, and Dr. Miller was at the hospital within 30 minutes of our arrival...and we were out of surgery within the next hour...very fast.  All the Dr.'s in the practice are great (Turner, Pack), you will more than likely see one of them at some point if you are pregnanat since Dr. Miller does go on vacation during part of the summer.
