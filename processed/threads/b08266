3 I've been to Dr. Glick 2 times.  Once for my 9mo daughter who was covered in a head to toe blistery rash, once to have a mole check & to look into erasing some of the AZ sun spots I've developed.  He offered nothing for the sun spots, citing that unless I avoid the sun alltogether it would be pointless.  Even after pointing out that I use 70spf and wear a hat daily - he refused to do anything.  The mole he removed turned out to be 100% ok - but left a HUGE scar on my thigh....
1 customer service stinks- enough said.  i asked my doctor for a dermatologist referal and was given this guy.  in doing my own research i couldn't find a web page for them besides a single page with no contact information.  i called and after immediately being put on hold for 5 minutes i got hung up on.  yeah, i really want to go there now- heck, i don't even trust my primary care doctor after this
1 I made an appointment for my daughter to see Dr. Glick,. we were both very excited about the appointment especially since Dr. Glick claimed to be a DO. We thought he would take a more natural approach to my daughter's acne. All he did was tell her she would most likely need acutane in the future (and we all know how safe that is!!!!) and tell her (without being asked his opinion on this matter......) that her post acne hyperpigmentation would take years to heal. What a terrible thing to tell a 14 year old girl just entering high school! He had terrible bedside manner and his office manager is incredibly rude!! STAY AWAY!!
