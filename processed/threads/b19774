5 Love this salon. Angela is one of the best hair stylists I have ever been too. She truly works wonders and makes excellent cuts and colors. Would HIGHLY recommend
5 This is a nice salon.  The woman who owns it is knowledgable, skilled, and a pleasure to do business with.  Excellent haircuts, pedicures and manicures!
5 Discovered this salon and Angela by Groupon accident and I am in love. I have very fine thin hair that needs an outstanding cut to look good. Everyone is raving about my hair, including the mirror. And the best part is that Angela charges significantly less than any of my former Scottsdale stylists
5 Don't let the location (off in the boonies, in a strip mall) fool you.  I was thrilled with the service I got. Angela did a great job helping me figure out what would work with my fine, limp hair and being honest about what wouldn't. Will definitely go back!
5 I found Angela about a year and a half ago from a Groupon deal.  The shop is kind of out of the way (Shea, right by the 51 freeway), and in an unpretentious little shopping mall.  I have hair that is not the easiest to work with and Angela did a great job!!  She listened to me and I came out with a haircut that I love!  I have been going back to her since then, and I always get great comments from others about my hair cut.  Her prices are very good for the service and skill you get from her.  I carry her cards with me in case anyone asks me who cuts my hair.  I'll be a happy customer as long as she is there!
