3 This has to be a new one.  Looks very nice and clean.  People where helpful and nice.  Has to be The best one I have ever been to.
1 Every time I go into a Walmart, I spend the hour after I leave wondering why I went again...  It could be the very decent prices or the fact that I had a gift card..., but the frustrations with lines, poor service and other customers having poor manners makes it not worth it.  I'd rather be at Target where they give good service, customers are courteous, and lines are shorter.
2 Run of the mill Walmart. Bad service, lacking in open registers, long lines that take forever, rude customers but the shelves are decently stocked with what I need when I go. Would much rather be at Target but the good deals and location being so close to home is hard to beat.
4 I like this Walmart. Clean, friendly. However, Saturday and Sunday this place can get packed, busy and super long lines. Don't make the same mistake as me, go on a different day and you won't as annoyed or pissed.
3 Is it me or does this place always look picked over?! There are never enough cashiers and when I do get to one they're just as grumpy as me! I'm all for  perusing while shopping but please don't leave your cart right in the middle of the isle and get all Huffington post when I say "excuse me" just be courteous people we both made the same dumb mistake on going hours before Super Bowl anyway!
3 I'm in Phoenix for two weeks and the hotel I am staying at has a full kitchen and with that being said....need to make a grocery store run to stock up the fridge with snacks and beer. I am normally not a fan of Walmart but ultimately what I thought was cool was they ran a price check with the other stores in the neighborhood and price matched everything in my basket which saved me like $15. I never knew anyone did such a thing like that, I guess its good in a sense and bad to where this big company makes it hard for small mom and pop joints to keep afloat.
