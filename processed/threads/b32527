5 Super selection, many items are new. I came here after finding an AbCircle for a great price on Craigslist and ended up leaving with new clothes, fancy beauty products (high-quality moisturizer and hair remover), a cat toy (25 cents!) and lip balm. They had toys, games, kitchenware, curtains, clothes, furniture, exercise stuff, beauty products, Halloween gear and small appliances. Great selection. The guy that runs this place is a total mellow cutie and I will definitely keep making the trek to Mesa to shop here. Join their mailing list for the heads up on $2 Tuesdays and other deal days.
1 Warehouse?  I stopped by the other day, no one was inside the very small room that was littered with garage sale remenants.  I stuck my head in, then left, if what I saw is the 'warehouse' it should be changed to Bargain Room.
5 This place has left over merchandise from stores like Kohl's, JC Penney, Home Depot and others.  I have been able to find some great deals here on clothing, outdoor furniture and toys. Some items are new, and others are damaged. They do test all their products and will tell you if something is not working, or if it is missing something. They are planning to move to a larger location. Merchandise changes all the time. If you are looking to find a bargain, you will find one.  In response to the post by C.B., there is more than one room. There is a smaller room when you first walk in. It has a lot of furniture and larger items. If you look, there is a door near the back that leads you to a larger room with a lot more to see.
