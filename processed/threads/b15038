1 Horrible horrible horrible horrible I want my money back Rebeca destroyed my hair I look horrible I paid to get my hair styled she couldn't even do that. My advice don't go here they will destroy your hair.
1 I was told my wait to get a hair cut was 20 minutes max. 40 minutes later I left without a haircut. Thanks for wasting 40 minutes of my time Great Clips!
5 Great place for a fast and quality haircut!!!
5 Eek, look at some of the low Reviews from the past!  Well, today was my first visit to this location of Great Clips, my regular salon chain for haircuts, and here's how it went:   *  I arrived at about 10:30 am on this SUNDAY, & expected the wait I'm accustomed to at 24th St. & Baseline or 7th Av. & Osborne, but I was seen right away!     :-))  *  My Stylist Caila was totally nice, really listened to what I wanted, and also gave me a PERFECT haircut!  I'll go out of my way to come back to her next time.     :-))  *  Today's visit was a super bargain, with a $7.99 coupon from one of the weekly shopper tabloids.     :-))  This altogether great visit to this Great Clips earned them 5 Stars, absolutely!
