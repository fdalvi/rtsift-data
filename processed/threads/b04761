5 Raised this review to a five star because they earned it.  Really appreciate the good work done on my vehicle.  The quarter panel was blended perfectly and looks great!
5 I went to Moore to get my back bumper replaced and was very pleased with the service.  The initial quotes were explained to me and the pricing was fair.  The staff was friendly and courteous and the work was done as promised.  I went to Moore out of convenience and was apprehensive after reading the other reviews posted here but didn't experience any of the problems the other reviewers did.  This was not an insurance claim/repair, if that matters.  My car looks great and they cleaned and vacuumed the interior before pick up.  Based on this experience I would highly recommend them!
5 I'm impressed!  Sometimes you wonder about a business that has few reviews - all of them 5star.  But I have to tell you, Moore took care of my new Chevy Equinox's real tailgate just as they promised, for the price promised and on time!  Can't get any better than that.  Their office manager, Kellie, was really easy to work with and my car was returned to me all cleaned and shiny inside and out.  I don't want to need their services again, but if I do, there's no question where I'd go!  Moore's!
