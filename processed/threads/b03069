5 My sandwich was fresh and made right when I ordered it. The bread was really good, I mean I realize it was just sub bread but it was super fresh and yummy! A pleasant surprise!  People at work bring in the donuts all the time and they are always fantastic. The gentleman at the counter was friendly and helpful. I will be back!
3 The donuts here are fresh and amazing. In my opinion, the best is the blueberry donuts that they offer.The tea is great too. The salad bar is basic and iceberg based. The sandwiches are fine, if it weren't for Eugene who gets upset when anyone tries to make a change or substitution on the sandwich. He even barks and passes this anger onto Kim, who is the one who actually makes the sandwiches. The guy seems like a pretty mean person, but if you steer clear of getting him mad, the place is good. Best for donuts, OK for everything else.
5 Best donuts around!
