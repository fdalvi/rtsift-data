4 I love Whataburger but the nearest ones to the rock I live under are in Arizona, so I was prepared with the locations of four different ones before we left on our big Festivus meander.  Turns out we ended up here in Casa Grande.  There's not much more I can say about this one that I didn't already cover in my review of the Kerrville branch on our previous trip.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz/whataburger-kerrville#hrid:8b1ui0HMqQ6RrFsmC3-L_Q)  Everybody here was super nice and they had chocolate pie.  Numm numm numm numm.
5 This is a gem in this area.  Great staff Margie is a godsend.  Love this place.
5 Great breakfast platter & cheap. They gave me free coffee, maybe because I'm a senior :)
