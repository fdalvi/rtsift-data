3 $20 for a Fossil watch battery and I had to come back 15-min later. While waiting I noticed several kiosks offering watch battery replacement from $10.
1 Adding insult to injury, the battery costs about $.50 at the retail level.  Can we say, "rip-off?"  Batteries Plus for about 1/3 the money.
4 I had some watches that five years ago I got batteries from here and I had warranty cards to replace the batteries if they died within five years. So of course a week before they expired two of them were dead. I actually found the warranty cards (I can't beleive I still knew where I kept them I sound like a very organized person). I went on down and within 15 minutes they had them both replaced. They quoted 20 minutes and came in under. It was no hassle, quick, and they were very friendly. So why 4 stars and not 5? Well the batteries were close to $50 bucks, but 2 of the 3 did get replaced for free, so that is like $25 each. However, I can go downstairs in Sears and get them done for $14.95 so even without the warranty (they only do a 1 year replacement) this is still a better deal.
1 Dropped my watch off to have it repaired. When I picked it up, only the wristband nad been cleaned, and the clerk said they couldn't clean the watch itself because that might damage it....curious that they didn't say that when I dropped it off! And only one week later, one of the pins holding the wristband and the watch together fell off and could not be replaced. This place is wretched, do not spend your money here!
5 I was frantic when my engagement ring broke 1 week before my wedding. I had no idea what to do and who wants to get married with a broken ring? I called Fast Fix and they repaired, rhodium dipped and cleaned my ring for me in no time! The price was very reasonable and the customer service was excellent. I was so impressed and relieved! I won't go anywhere else for my jewelry now.
