1 I would never go back to this chiropractor or any of the 'Spinal Health of Nevada' locations. First, the front desk staff was horribly rude. They were super nice over the phone but once I got to the practice, they were so short and unhelpful. Second, the main chiropractor acted like he had better things to do than treat me and was very arrogant. I caught him rolling his eyes while I was describing my back pain symptoms to him. Finally, they are so expensive for what they offer. There are hundreds of other chiropractors in the area that offer the same and more techniques than this place does for a reasonable price. PLEASE do yourself a favor and stay away.
1 Devin Luzod is a scammer !!!! Never adjusted just sales pitched and shown videos .. Waste of time  and $
1 I can't even give it a star.  180.00 no adjustment, just videos, and a sales pitch. I'm canceling my payment for fraud via credit card. F this scamming bastage. I have ZERO good things to say about the 4000.00 plan that they wanted me to finance through GE capital.  Do NOT go to this place. Unless you want to just throw away money.
