5 If you are an ice cream aficionado you will absolutely love Doc's! The gourmet frozen fruit bar flavors will satisfy any gourmet dessert desire. How about Mango Habanero? or Coconut Lemongrass Lime? or Blueberry Pomegranate? or my new favorite, Blood Orange?  There are so many melt-on-your-soul flavors to choose from the only problem you will have is deciding . . . . deciding which one is next!  Doc's ice creams are made with locally produced and sourced ingredients . . . . with no dyes, no colorings, no GMO's, and are all handcrafted frozen gelatos, sorbets, sherberts, custards and artisan ice creams.   A LOCAL TREASURE . . . . right here in our little neck of the planet!
4 I really enjoyed their popsicles at Devoured last weekend. I am looking forward to coming in for a visit.
5 Doc's caught our eye at the downtown Phoenix Public Market. Oh yummy luscious is his Pi√±a Colada sorbet ( so smooth) and pineapple green tea gelato (super refreshing)! But what made my knees hit the ground, was the oh so decadent Tequila Sunrise :)   Lots and lots of creative flavors and quality ingredients and not to mention the nicest bunch of folks too!!   Unfortunately we are not close to him in Tempe...so hoping he is at the market when go there!
5 It is rare that I ever get excited about a dessert item, but this place has earned the excitement. I recently discovered Doc's and every trip I get to try a different amazing flavor that this place offers.   It cannot be understated that Doc's starts with high quality ingredients to create a sorbet or gelato that tastes like the best possible version of what it describes. The blackberry cabernet sorbet is miraculous and tastes like the perfect marriage of the flavors and not just frozen sugar on a stick.
