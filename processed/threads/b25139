5 Wendy and Paul Hartman have a wonderful gymnastics and tumbling studio here.  Both of my daughters, ages 3 and 5, love to come here!  They are so friendly, as are the instructors that both my daughters have had.  They are also patient and they interact really well with the kids.  The gym is clean and organized, with seats for parents to watch through big windows.  It's also a nice place to hold a kid's birthday party!  I would highly recommend this place to others!
1 I called to inquire about private tumbling lessons for my teenager who is thinking of trying out for cheerleading but doesn't have tumbling skills.  Paul said that before we spent money on privates, I should bring her in to open gym for an evaluation.  Because my daughter is a beginner gymnast, and I've seen the experienced tumblers at open gym, I asked if we could do it some other time, as she would be uncomfortable in front of everyone.  Paul said that since cheerleaders have to perform in front of crowds, maybe she should re-evaluate cheer.  Seriously?  Does a cheerleader go in front of everyone and do a cheer they never learned before?  Of course not, they practice in private and perform when they are ready.  Do you know anything about my daughter except I said she was shy?  Not the type of comment I'd want for a potential coach.  Not the smartest business move either....
1 If I had a choice, I would give this place no stars. Coaches are bullies when you're not looking.
