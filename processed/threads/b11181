4 This is one of those needle in a haystack 99 cent stores. Not your chain outlet. There's only one of these in this town.  Be aware that not everything is 99 cents. Honestly, they should probably change their name. When they first opened everything was 99 cents, but no longer. Despite this, they have some really great deals here and the majority of the things I buy aren't 99 cents. Best deals on things like Tide and Downy, sports socks and batteries to name a few and the things that are 99 cents are a pretty good bang for your buck. If you haven't checked this one out, I highly recommend you do. It's at least worth one visit.
5 The workers there are very kind. Specially the cashier Fillipino guy who works there. The stuff there are not all 99cents but they have some good deals. The socks are nice. I think i saw most of things at swap meet. But cheaper. Nice worker and nice deals. I would go back.
5 I was expecting this store to be those other 99cents store, but actually this store has alot of great stuff!!! This is one of my favorite stores!! I love the stuff they have here and the prices are awesome as well. I definitely recomend to visit this store if you havent yet!!
