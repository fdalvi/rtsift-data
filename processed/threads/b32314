5 Working with Prime Auto Glass was painless and easy!  From start to finish, great service, on time and well done.  They even did the insurance work.  What a pleasure.
1 First time they came to put my windshield in i asked the guy if it was just him. I know that it will take at least two people... Hour later he said he needs someone else. The second time they come out one guy showed up again and said someone else is coming, but i want to start so by the time he gets here... Hour passes the guy says he cant put it in bc of the glass. Original glass, brand new factory gasket. Dont waste your time with these people. They dont know what there doing, also terrible customer service. Hope this helps.
5 Prime Auto Glass was professional and courteous!  My company uses the Ford transits and while most auto glass places didn't have the item since the transits were fairly new; Prime Auto Glass was still able to get it for us!    The installer was on time and worked relatively quick and within a couple of hours we had new windshield.  So far it's holding up very well and after a year my windshield is doing dandy. Let's just hope the freeway gods won't chuck another pebble at it anytime soon!    Overall, great service, fast and on time.  We all hate to deal with our car maintenance, but companies like Prime Auto Glass just makes things smoother and easier on all of us! - Enjoy!
