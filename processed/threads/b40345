5 Great staff, very friendly and quick service. The food was delicious. You can't go wrong with their Mongolian steak.
5 This looked like the best food option in terminal 4. I'm glad I chose it. I am a vegetarian and the cashier girl was very friendly and helpful and gave me great options not listed on the menu. The food was cooked to order (you can see them so you know it's fresh). It tastes great and the food was brought out to me at the table. Great service and great food and at a great affordable price.
4 Great place to grab a good breakfast boritto when stuck on a layover. The rice they add to the standard bacon and eggs makes for a mild asian flavor. This stand is owned by pfchangs. The food quality isn't the same but its a notch above the standard fare. Give it a try.
1 Had the breakfast wrap. It had so much oil in it. I mean tons of oil dripping everywhere. I always thought of pei Wei as the healthier option, not anymore.
