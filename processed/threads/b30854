5 This is THE website to go to for EXCELLENT spa, all beauty needs deals.  DO check out this website before you book any appointments!  Lisa, the owner, is true to her words.  The couple of times that I had direct interactions with her, everything she said she would do was completed in a timely manner.    Plus, I love their Summer Spaaaah Series
5 If you like getting spa treatments (and who doesn't) then it's silly not to stay up to date with the specials and reviews AZ Spa Girls offers. Make sure to subscribe to their newsletter and "like" them on Facebook. I've been able to take advantage of amazing steals for massages, gel manicures and B-12 shots.
5 Love, love, love Arizona Spa Girls!!!  I can't say enough good things about them. Lisa, the owner is amazing and so nice. She organizes the best events and deals for all of us spa loving girls (and guys) in Arizona. If you like to be pampered, and who doesn't, you must sign up for their email list and follow them on facebook.   Lots of great articles on spa treatments, coupons to try out services, events to check out new places and my absolute favorite, Summer Spa Series!  I always enjoy a good massage but rarely can justify treating myself to a spa day at a local spa. It's just so expensive! Until Spa Girls that is. Their summer spa series is a great, affordable way to check out a spa you have been wanting to try. You get to go to a great kick-off event where you get a goody bag filled with great samples, coupons, etc. As well as food, cocktails and mini services. Then you go back sometime in the following month for your spa day. Oh, and a part of your ticket purchase goes to charity! So you can feel good about being good to yourself and others!  I can not recommend this enough. Check it out, you will not be disappointed!!
