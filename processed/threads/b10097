5 Tried this place for the first time last week and we were VERY happy with everything we tried.  We ordered egg fried rice, veggie egg foo young, shiu mai, chicken noodle soup, won ton soup and pepper steak.  Seriously, everything was really very good!  The soups especially were a great surprise....all the noodles were the homemade long egg noodles.  Yummo!    As the previous reviewer stated, the service does take a little longer than your normal take out place, but it's well worth the wait.    The service is outstanding and everyone was very friendly.    I highly recommend Jasmine Express!!!
5 You know you've ordered from a place too many times when you walk through the door and the owner shouts your name and address.  But we can't help it. My husband and I love Jasmine Express. The chicken wings are crispy and served on a bed of shredded cabbage and sliced Serrano peppers. Little bits of chicken skin fall to the bottom of the pile, and the  resultant mix is even better than the actual wings.  The Singapore noodles have a complex melange of flavors that make me want to read Dune and whisper "the spice...!" between mouthfuls.   The potstickers are equally delightful, as are the cream cheese wontons. Fried rice fans should try the basil fried rice. Better yet, order it extra spicy.  They even have Boba tea - my favorite is the lychee.  Unlike the previous reviewer, we've always had fast service here. Deliveries arrive hot in less than 30 minutes, and take out orders are even faster.
4 Pretty decent Chinese delivery as far as Vegas goes. Haven't found something GREAT yet, but this is my #1 delivery for now. They were very friendly and I asked about military discount and they gave me 10% off the order. Food was pretty good. Definitely Americanized :p
4 I'm not normally a Chinese food fan, but I've been craving it like crazy lately! We had an excellent experience this past week at Jasmine Express. Any place that delivers is a plus in my book... especially when it arrives much before the said time and is delicious & piping hot! We had beef broccoli, house fried rice, & the walnut shrimp. All of them were fantastic. I have a new found love for walnut shrimp, AMAZING! The only down side was they said they didn't have brown rice which I did see on the menu. 4 stars!
4 The fried rice is pretty good (we always ask for no peas no carrots and more bean sprouts and green onions).   I would also recommend the szechuan chicken and walnut shrimp.
4 A decent Chinese resturaunt i must say. Food was good and came out very presentable. The hostess barely speaks English so its hard to explain a specialty order and hard to understand her coversation but she's very nice.  The building was very clean with spacious seating. There's one t.v. to watch and I'm sure you could arrange to have the channel changed to whatever you like.   Not too expensive due to have a lunch special. Very chill and relaxing and did I mention how good the food is? Lol  I ordered the kung pao chicken which was amazing!! A bit spicy but I expected it to be. Not stingy with the chicken and evened out with vegitables.  Overall, the place is amazing and is proud to have Yelpers eat the restaurant because they have a big sign at the register that thanks fellow reviewers such as you & I.  Will definitely be eating here again soon.
4 I come here at least once a week for my lunch break. They have lunch specials from 11am-3pm ranging from $6-$8, but I come here for the Combination Pho. I think it's the best dish they offer. This is probably the only place that serves Pho on this side of town.  Call ahead to order your food, because they take a long time.
5 This is the best Chinese ever! My wife loves the Hot and Sour soup and orders it regulally, they now know her and treat her very well, sometimes with fried rice and other times with spring rolls. It is always amazing!
5 soo addicting!!!! I live in Henderson and I went here because my cousin lives in N.las vegas and told me about this place. I love the beef combination pho soup!!! Sooo bomb! They said no msg...hmmm...but still soo good! I am craving for more at the moment. Restaurant is clean and friendly staff, and also tried the chow mein which was very tasty as well!!! 5stars!
5 Yea I went there 3 times on Thursday with my brother, then I went my cousin & my goddaughter Emma Saturday, then Monday this evening I went with my cousin, her husband & my goddaughter again. I love Jasmine Express. I like the Chow Mein & the pork yummy yummy.
3 We got takeout from Jasmine Express about a week ago. It was decent, but not incredible. The Mongolian Beef was very good, the dumplings and fried rice were okay, and the Orange Chicken was just meh (didn't even taste "orangey" at all). I would recommend JE, however, my wife and I actually prefer New China Cuisine which is right across the street. Overall their food is better and they do combo family meals which helps keep the price down a bit compared to JE.
5 So glad I found this place. We used to have to drive way into town just to satisfy our craving for pho! This is the first place in north las Vegas that sells pho! Just right up the street. Good prices and good pho!
2 Meh. I've experienced better.  Here lies my meager attempt to find some good pho.  I can't go too long without some, and strangely enough, it seems to be a rarity near me.  They seem to specialize in Chinese food, but all I was interested in was the Vietnamese.  Hard to screw up pho for me.  All it needs is the right ingredients and just take a hot minute to get to me.  I'll probably blame the usual clientele for the limited pho selection, but I have also seen worse.  This is the first time I've seen tendon pho all by itself; usually it's along side tripe and other meats.  This could have been very disappointing as I don't typically see a lot of tendon in pho, but no, they were generous here.  On the other hand, for an establishment that prides itself on fresh ingredients (even says so on the menu), their condiments were far from such.  The lime, basil, and sprouts looked far older than I cared to guess.  I drowned them in the hot broth before I decided they might be unappetizing -- except the sprouts as they were just too far gone.  Maybe if they hadn't called so much attention to their ingredients, I would have been more lenient.  Noodles and broth were sufficient in quantity and quality.  Here's a little story: I had a tad too much sun earlier that day and was quite burnt.  I know: strange that I would want hot pho after being sunburnt, but I just had to have it.  They had the plus of being an all Asian staff; I almost prefer it when there was a language barrier to overcome -- typically a sign of authenticity.  And I found some of that with the waitress.  Now there was one exchange that I just wasn't understanding, but after a bit of back-and-forth, turns out she was asking me if I was drunk because of my red face.  While funny at the moment, it sadly once again made me think of what kind of clientele they have to put up with to require that kind of question.  At least she was nice about it.  Another interesting note was the television had a soccer game on in Spanish.  This was a first for me in an Asian establishment, and I'll have to be forgiven for asking about it.  Turns out the owner himself likes it and speaks it.  Supposedly the regulars expect nothing less.  It was these experiences more than the pho that might make me return.
5 By far the best chinese I have had!  I love chinese food but most places I go upset my stomach as well as my husband's.  This place seemed fresh, not too greasy, and super delicious!  I prefer fried rice but I must admit I love the fluffiness of this white rice.  The staff was friendly and the restaurant clean.  Most definitely my new go-to place for chinese cuisine!
2 I was excited about this restaurant because I could get a bowl of pho without having to drive across town. The pho is good but the service is terrible. Delivery time is over an hour so I decided to pick up the next time. I ordered two pho and 1 order of egg rolls. I left my house 10 minutes after I ordered thinking it would be ready by the time I drove up there. But I was wrong. When I got there not only was my order not ready. I don't even think she put it in. Also she told me that there was only enough pho for one order something she could have told me over the phone before I drove up there. So I waited in there hot restaurant for another twenty minute just to receive half my order. I was not offered anything for free to make up for their mistake.
3 It's hard to find good Chinese food anymore, especially with delivery. This place got the job done. Did it blow my mind? Eh, not really, but it had some high points.  I found the chicken fried rice totally awesome. Just salty enough, great flavor, really good.  The sweet n' sour chicken was good, but they should consider putting the sauce on the side when doing delivery. It was very soggy, so I ended up pulling off the outsides and just eating the middle.  The lo mein would've been good -- the chicken in it was white meat and cooked well - but the noodles were way overcooked (again, likely due to the delivery time), so they were mush. And I though it was a little bland.  The pork wontons I really liked. My boyfriend didn't like them as much because he really likes those kinds that are just a big fried noodle with a tiny dot of meat in the middle. These have more meat, but are still quite good, in my opinion.  The crab rangoon was... average. Cooked well, tasted fine. I'd order those again, but they weren't a stand-out, really.  The steamed rice was cooked well and not mushy or underdone.  The whole thing, including delivery tip was $40 or so, not too bad and they were right on time -- 30 minutes.  I'd order from here again, though I might try some other items that won't sog-out, preferably something with vegetables!
4 Yep, I'm a fan! My friend and I drove past this restaurant once and one day decided to give it a shot... She got beef and broccoli and I got beef and green pepper. Beef and green pepper is pretty much just like beef pepper steak. It was only a 15 minute wait, so we went next door to smiths to grab some wine and kill time. After reading reviews, I'm curious as to what 'pho' is and how it tastes... that might be the next thing I try!
4 I like this place. There aren't a lot of good Chinese/Vietnamese restaurant choices up north- unless you're into the usual china-a-go-go type places. People are friendly and courteous and are more than happy to make any order cooked just the way you like it. The food is good too.
5 They have Boba! that alone gives them 5 stars! Finally a good boba place in north las Vegas :)
4 We went based on the reviews and we were pleasantly surprised. We only tried the combo pho and the combo vermicelli, but they were both good. My husband liked the ice coffee too. The service and variety were fine. The food is better near Chinatown, but that doesn't mean this place wasn't good for what we had. I do think the AC needs to be turned up. Good Vietnamese food near Aliante.
4 Got to love the Spring Rolls and Strawberry smoothie with boba.    The first time I went here, is with the wife.  Since she saw the reviews were very good.  So trusting the yelpers out there, I decided to tag along.  I was kind of skeptical since it was next to a Smith grocery store and a Subway.  It is a decent size place to eat at.  The inside looks nicely decorated and the staff seems really nice.  The seating arrangement was kind of tight in a sense, but we were able to sit and eat in.    I usually have my spring rolls, and they were really good.  I really like their Strawberry smoothie.   I had their teriyaki Bowl, which was good, and decent.  The wife had the Pho and thought it was okay.    My overall thoughts, I would come here for the spring rolls.  But dining in, is okay, but probably during the off time, like after lunch or before dinner.  So if you're in the area, you should try it.
5 Loved the pineapple fried rice! Scrimp was huge.   Just as good as Sanam's but no wait time!
4 .I have been going there for the last 6 months.  I love the Pho soup.  They do a wonderful job of packing it up for take out.  It is wonderful having it here in North Las Vegas, and save a trip from going to Spring Mountain.  The girls working up front are so sweet and helpful.  This is my Asian restaurant in North Las Vegas.  It is a hidden secret.
2 Well Shucks.  I wanted to like the local Chinese joint, but I was underwhelmed two times.  I had the basil chicken.  It just didn't taste very good - I really can't explain it.  The fried rice was real dark with nothing in it.    I can't remember what I got the second time I went... I did see crickets crawling around the floor both times I was there.  This is basically your typical local Chinese restaurant.  It is probably okay if you just want to stop by and get a quick cheap lunch.
3 Let me start off by saying the food is okay for the price. I was a little disappointed because my order wasn't right. The shrimp was overcooked, hard and rubbery. One of my egg foo young patties had a rotten taste to it, but the other three patty's were okay...go figure... I expressed my concerns and was given another fresh order the next day. So I will give them another chance. Staff is friendly and place is clean.
4 Overall we really liked the food. We started with yummy crab Rangoon to share, then I had the Singapore rice noodles which was nice & spicy. My husband had cashew chicken and it was also great. I do have to say after we took a table in the sit down part of the restaurant, we noticed 2 of the tables had food & drinks leftover from the last customers & they didn't get bused until we were paying our check & leaving. Also while we were eating, we overheard the girl taking the orders over the phone had apologized to 2 different callers for having delivered the wrong food. So I would suggest to come in & order take out rather than order delivery. Hopefully the next time we go, the tables will be bused. Overall the food came out quickly & tasted great but the service could use some work. We gave it an 8 out of 10.
3 Groupon brought me here! The menu is extensive and they serve a lil bit of Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese entrees. I was craving Chinese this time and decided to give it a try; ordered pineapple fried rice (tasty, with 6-7 pcs of shrimp), sesame chicken (just ok), & combination vermicelli (good), all to go. We didn't have to wait too long (10 minutes).   The food is at least 3 stars (A-OK and I will come back). I'm already marking down what I'll try next. The staff were all friendly and helpful. They pointed out that they always have specials going on, whether it's $20 worth of food for $10 Groupon or 20-25% coupon on their website. Make sure you check in on your Yelp app so you get 2 free veggie egg rolls.
1 Horrible service!! Served me old food!!
4 Bolba is on point. That's the only reason I go here.
3 There are a lot of Chinese restaurants around here.  Unfortunately they all kind of taste the same.  The food here was good, but nothing stood out as extraordinary.
3 This is really more of a 2 star rating...but given there are not too many options in North Las Vegas....relative to the area and the options available, it gets 3 stars.  It's pretty much a glorified panda express menu with some Thai/Vietnamese offerings.  We tried the Vietnamese food....the grilled pork&shrimp, egg rolls, rice option and the similar vermicelli bowl option. The meat was rather dry and slightly on the salty side.  The egg rolls were quite mediocre and flavorless inside.  The noodles were cooked well....We also tried the fried chicken wing appetizer...and they were tasty but perhaps that was due to the excessive use of MSG as seasoning...none the less it was crispy goodness but I probably drank 3 glasses of water after the appetizer.  Will I come back?  Perhaps....there are just those days when I'm too lazy to drive....
1 I have enjoyed eating lunch at this place many times. UNTIL my last visit. I sat down for lunch and just started to enjoy my soup. I noticed an ant on my knee and squished it thinking nothing of it, then I noticed the floor which had hundreds of ants which were feeding on a piece of fortune cookie. I brought to the lady's attention and had a guy come out to take care of it. I simply moved to another table. He had a trash can, a broom and dust pan. He swept them up, put them in a trash can which he then placed behind the counter. REALLY!?!? The ants aren't dead now you just got them closer to the kitchen. I mentioned that to him but he didn't care. As he was mopping the floor where they used to be, he hit the planter and two American cockroaches came running out. That was it, I was done because they probably have German roaches in the kitchen. I have not been there since. I like the food but I am concerned about the cleanliness of the place.   NOTE: I am in pest control, however I do not service restaurants because I enjoy eating out. But they use no one and they should. Hopefully they do now.
1 the food quality is not consistent. the wait is oh so looooonnnggg, every single time. once, i called in my order and gave them 45 minutes to prepare my food, and when i arrived at the restaurant, i waited another 20 minutes. and while i paid as soon as i got there, i was asked by staff if i had already paid before handing me my food. today will be the last time i set my foot here, because you made me wait again...oh jasmine express, you keep breaking my heart!
1 We have been going to the Jasmine Express for the past year and a half.  Each time the quality of the food has been getting worst.  The portion sizes are decreasing.  Tonite we ordered the Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao Pork for take out.  We spent $19.00 including tax.  Our container of Mongolian Beef and white rice was only half full.  I was disappointed and called the restaurant.  We have ordered Mongolian Beef before and have received a full container.  When ordering 2 entrees   we have always had plenty of rice.  When speaking to the young man on the phone and telling him how unhappy I was, all he said was so sorry.  To top our disappointed evening off more, we found a piece of hair in the Mongolian Beef.  It is time for us to take our busy elsewhere and past on my bad experience as a warning.
1 I have to write a review for this place because there are so many high reviews that I think they must be fake. I'm not a picky person, but the food that I got was bad. I got the Korean barbeque ribs and I couldn't even cut through them with a knife. They were all fat and hardly any meat. I don't like how there's no one in the restaurant to greet people when they come in. The girls go in the kitchen and even though the door makes a noise when someone comes in, no one comes out and they end up standing there awkwardly and waiting like 10 minutes. It made me feel uncomfortable when two separate customers came in and waited like that and started getting mad when no one came to them. The restaurant also doesn't seem clean. I went in the bathroom and it was dirtier looking than a gas station bathroom. There was no soap or paper towels at all. This was probably one of the worst restaurants I've been to (although the waitress we had, a little girl who looked like she's probably in high school, was really nice).
1 Found something that looked like a pubic hair on the rim of my glass... I cancelled the order, and will never return.
3 Good decent food.  Good service.  Bathroom is not so great.  And the general ambiance is very much on that lower end fast food vibe.  It would get a solid 4 if they fixed up the place.  The food was good though.   Food was a 4 Place was a 2.5
1 By far the wost 40$ I've spent at an Asian restaurant. Came in ordered and everything was ready in ten minutes. The food tasted recooked, old,  mircowaved. Not worth what I paid. Will never come here again!! Totally gross. Panda Express is better and that's saying something because they have crappy food too.
4 My local Chinese spot never disappoints me... Good service (for a Chinese restaurant at least) fresh and fast I go at least 4x a month!
1 Totally disappointed. This was my 4th time eating here and quite possibly my last.   First, I ordered the speciality fried rice (The server described it as "the white fried rice and not the dark") It came with chopped pork, chicken and whole shrimp. The shrimp had their intestinal tracks still intact. The chicken was really dry which makes me think they used old leftover pre cooked chicken. And the rice was hard and some pieces were crunchy. When fried rice gets stuck in my teeth, it's not good fried rice.   I also ordered the rare beef Pho. When the server brought the plate of Jalapenos, bean sprouts, and thai basil, the jalapenos were dry and rotting, the basil came wilted and had a lot of brown spots. I asked her to change it out and she did.   Usually whenever I get Pho, it comes steaming hot. Since I only saw little puff of steam, I knew I was in trouble. I went to stir it and the noodles on the bottom were still clumped together, and a small ice cube was in the noodles! I pulled it out and kept stirring the Pho to loosen the noodles. Usually when I get the rare beef, the soup cooks it because its so hot. Not this time... After I tasted it, I called the server over and asked her if she could warm it up in the microwave because it was luke warm. After 15 mins, the little old lady in the back came out with the Pho and said that if I order rare beef it will stay rare. I told her that was fine, but I didnt want cold soup.   When I got the Pho back, I could tell she just boiled the hell out of it because it was full of floaters from the cooked blood from the rare beef. It just looked disgusting. I couldnt eat it, and asked for my check. Instead of making things better, the server just gave me the check and I paid 25.00 for NOTHING. (I did drink my Thai tea)    There was a total lack of service. There was only one other person during my entire visit. Nobody ever really checked on my table. And it was hard to get the servers attention when I needed something.   I am really surprised at the quality of the food, because their sister restaurant Da Lat is outstanding. I thnk the manager or chef at Da Lat needs to pay Jasmine a visit....
2 Food was greasy. It was hot in there and service was ok. Food was alright. I give them ONE whopping "bleh" star and ANOTHER as a thank you for the free egg roll upon checking-in through Yelp. :-p
4 Great food. Their pad tai was to die for.
2 Hot and sour soup is very bitter. It is almost like it is made of pure sour. Food is decent. My husband enjoyed the rice. It was mediocre Chinese food.
4 I stumbled upon this location when my gf was under the weather and needed some hot pho to help her feel better. Its a small hole-in-the-wall place right in between Vons and Subway. As I entered in I was greeted by the only server there, Chris. As I was going through the menu for take-out (which is really nice because most of the dishes have pictures) I was noticing Chris' customer service and he was well knowledgeable and very customer friendly. I ordered the Plain noodle pho, Pan fry beef vermicelli, and special combo rice plate which came with 3 eggrolls, shrimp, and grilled pork. Now before I tell you how bomb the food was, I must pause for a little constructive criticism. If you plan on doing a take-out, call in AT LEAST 15-20 min before hand. I seriously waited for 30-35 minutes while sitting down with my back against the glass entrance wall where the waiting seats are with the Sun beaming on my back. A lady to the right of me that came in a little later than I asked me if I called in before or placed an order when I came in because she said she called in 20 min before and has been waiting for 45 MIN - AN HOUR. -which is ridiculous for any restaurant especially when there's very little ppl. Did I mention the sun is beaming down on our backs? I knew I should have gotten that thai tea...lol. The lady also said that the total ambiance of the place changed but the food was always good. That being said, THE FOOD WAS BOMB. Great proportions and decent prices. The Food was actually fresh! -Definitely something you want when ordering from an oriental/asian restaurant with all the seafood and vegetables they utilize.   Great/Fresh food. Great customer service. The only reason I gave 4/5 stars is simply because with just a few arrangements the restaurant can look a lot nicer, And the wait time for take-out was long! Especially with the chairs against the glass entrance wall. But the Food was great and worth the wait. WHEW...lol
3 This is my first review but felt the need to post.  Used groupon so gave them a 3 star for the value.  Like groupon and they generally work out good for me.  Ordered S&S pork and Kung Po Chicken both were just OK.  Fried rice also meh to ok.  Red sauce/sweet? came with the order but had some kind of burnt pieces floating around in it, not sure if that is the way it was suppose to be but I've never seen it before.  Crab Rangoon-way over cooked wontons-filling was OK but skimmpy.  Tempura Shrimp-skinny, dry and hard-close to inedible.  Veg Egg rolls-inedible-had to throw away.  I am not a picky eater but literally could not bite thru the egg rolls.  Sorry will not be back.  Maybe the Pho food is better.
3 Closest pho from my house.. Not as good as the ones close to china town but it'll do! Waiter is always friendly and service is quick. But if u want pho in north Vegas this is the place to go.
2 Probably has to be one of the worst sit-down restaurant experiences I've ever had. The service is overlook-able. i ordered the beef noodle pho. The broth itself is pretty bland and felt like a chore to eat. It was a herbal beef broth with a slight sweet taste to it. Nothing special. The noodles were alright and the vegetables (Bean sprouts, cilantro, onion; the lime was a little dry) were fresh.   The bad rating comes from the beef. The actual beef muscle was okay but the beef tendon tasted pretty spoiled. I've eaten soups, including herbal soups with beef tendon. That did not come close to the weird nasty taste this tendon had. Quite overpriced as well. Better/similar prices in other locations. Would recommend New China Cuisine right across the street. Kinda similar but at least the beef was decent quality and the portions are great.
1 we visited first time for to go food. Being vegetarian order spring roll, Mix vegg and it was horrible. we would never ever recommend this restaurant to any of our friends and family. Food quality was so down, vegetables were not at all fresh. Spring oil with oil and have no idea what they stuff.   There is no zero star otherwise could have given "zero star"
2 The same Chinese food you will find in any clone Chinese takeout joint. It serves a purpose if you are broke or drunk, and little else. Heavy on the deep fryer and sugary sauce, light on quality. Although it may have been an isolated incident, the one time I ordered delivery, they quoted me a half hour and it ended up being well over an hour.
1 this place is a joke... I came in and ordered 2 smoothies and they made me wait 25 minutes for 2 drinks... they gave us a straw that had sticky substance on it... WTF. it was expensive for no reason and the smoothies weren't even tasty. NEVER COMING BACK.
4 This place has good cheap food.  No complaints...the service was a LITTLE slow considering there we're a ton of people in there, but they did go BUY jallapeno's when I asked for more which was WAY above and beyond. We got the veggie spring rolls, thia tea and pho...it was all really good.  I got a yep appetizer for free and a buy 2 get one free thia tea, which was exciting!  Bottom Line: This is definitely a good Vietnamese place...I'll be going again.
3 Service and timing are really lacking, but the food is good. First, we've (fam of 4) always had our food delivered and this time decided to dine-in. I'll either stick to delivery or have to place our dine-in order 20-25 minutes before arriving and hope that they have our small order ready to serve at one time instead of 10 minutes apart on a not so busy night. There were only 3 tables occupied including ours..the other two tables were couples. One table complained because they served the dude the rare beef pho and not the well-done. So hearing that and experiencing what we did with our order, I'd say to make sure they repeat your order back to you. Try their other fried rice, they're tasty...the regular kind is a waste of $.
5 Just had lunch for the very first time here. I can't believe I'm about to leave Vegas in a few months and have been here since '09 and have never eaten here.  I had the shrimp pork vermicelli and my wife had the lemon chicken. Both were excellent. When you come here you must try the Boba Strawberry Smoothie! Great prices and nice portions, will definitely be back soon!
5 I have been coming here for a few months now and Jasmine Express is still the best in Las Vegas compared to what China Town has to offer. The service is excellent. Chris and everyone who works here are really nice and treats the customers courteously.
4 So I found this place via the EAT24 app as I have two young kids and taking them anywhere is just a joke at this point. So I haven't been into the actual restaurant but I have ordered delivery a half a dozen times. I have one word for the food.. PHO!! I might have a slight addiction to asian noodle soup and theres is exceptionally good! Ive had it 4 times this week and will probably be getting it again tomorrow! I also ordered the Pad Thai and it was pretty good. About a 3 out of 5 for the Pad Thai.
1 Do not request your order for delivery. Took us almost 2 hours to get our food and we are still waiting. Very disappointing! We called to find out what's going on, someone picked up, then hung up on us. Never eating here again.
4 I'm very excited that I found this place! North LV is not exactly known for excellent Asian cuisine.  I actually stumbled upon this place by sheer accident  (or lazyness, i'll let you be the judge of that).  the day i ran into this place, i was feeling tired and under the weather. All I really wanted was some comfort food, some Tinola with rice and some fish sauce :) (tinola ~ vegetable, ginger, soupy strew, usually made with chicken) but the only way i was going to get that is if i made it myself, so i headed to smith's. once i got there i changed my mind, and decided i was so not in the mood to cook at all, but that was not gong to fix my hunger issues. so i walked into jasmine express, and was pleasantly surprised to see pho on the menu. Of course that is exactly what I got and it was actually very good!  Besides Vietnamese food, i was very excited to discover that they offer Thai food as well. It's about time!!  They have some decent pad Thai, pad si ew, and thai tea boba.  Needless to say I am over the moon that finally found a place so close to me, that serves Asian cuisine other than Chinese and Japanese and is really good.  Definitely recommend!
1 Here I go again.  I get a craving for Pho soup and don't feel like driving across town to Spring  Mountain, so I ordered take out at Jasmine Express.  Big mistake.  I notice the windows were so dirty on the restaurant, that I wondered about the kitchen.  I had to wait for me order and seen a dead cockroach on the floor and flies all over the place.  This is Vegas, we don't have problems with flies due to the heat.  When I got home with my soup my container was only 1/2 filled with broth.  The onion and bean sprouts were brown and old.   After adding my own onions and bean sprouts, I wonder when the last time the health department was in for inspection.  I highly recommend eating at your own risk when visiting this restaurant.  It is a hole in the ground and get worse everytime I visit.
4 This place has improved quite a bit since the last time I visited. I must say that their phô is just as good as the ones in china town. The portion size is good and the price is average. Definitely will be a place I will continue to go to for my phô cravings and Thai tea bobas!  Even bigger plus is that it's right in the north Las Vegas neighborhood.
4 Awesome place for pho ! Special combination is good,  but there serving is  not consistent sometimes you get a big portion then next time you get a sad face  :( but this is the only restaurant that serves pho in my area . Service is excellent ! Hope  This information is useful :)
2 Walking in randomly I saw they had boba milk...it was an experience...it didn't taste right and to top it off the boba was still hard in the middle and it was full of ice...not worth the $4.05 if you ask me...could get one for a better price and with a better taste down the street..will not be going back..
3 Meh!!!  The downside - The pho soup was just alright and the restaurant was a bit dirty and the service was slow.  The upside - The staff was very nice and the price was good. Overall it was just an average experience.
2 Chinese and Thai food awful. Vietnamese food...meh. Boba also meh. Enough to tide me over when I can't get to Chinatown. And they deliver (sometimes) when I'm super lazy.
1 This restaurant rates. #1 on the worst Chinese fast food list in the country. I have lived in many places and in many states and this "restaurant" is the worst.   We ordered Crab Rangoon & General Tso chicken. The crab rangoon was very small, overcooked and had a smear of who knows what in it. The General Tso chicken had something that resembled paint thinner and smelled like it too. The chicken was the cheapest quality a restaurant could buy. For fear of spending the weekend in the hospital I stuck to the overcooked crab rangoon and some rice. I was desperate!  If you have the iron stomach and complete lack of taste buds to try the food here you might want to avoid the duck sauce. That was nastier than the paint thinner, er the chicken.
1 I have given this place chance after chance. I don't know why they have the elderly man still making the food. I have nothing against him personally and give him respect for trying, but it's clearly time to retire. The food is HORRIBLE! I order two orders of Egg Foo Young for me and my friend. That was $25 down the drain because neither of us ate more than 1 of the 4 patties it came with! It was the WORST EFY we have both ever eaten. I feel bad because it was my idea to go there! I will NEVER give this place my money again!
1 We've been coming here for the past 2 years. The food was good then but I don't know what happened? The food had gotten worst! Even that...food was AWEFUL! I ordered some Vietnamese food that I've been normally ordering. Today, the looks and taste of it is totally different. The salt and pepper shrimp that is supposed to be fantastic was very very oily and soggy. The Vietnamese spring roll with shrimp was smelly and yucky, ended up not eating it. The Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce was so over cooked and it was floating in its sauce. The fried rice was dark brown, it was overloaded with soy sauce.  I  complain about it but they did not even offer to exchange it or make a new one. Not even an apology for this AWEFUL meal.   Jasmine Express you are done in my book! And for all of you out there who wants to try....Don't! You will be very disappointed!  AWEFUL..AWEFUL...AWEFUL !!!! BAD FOOD...consider this as a warning! DO NOT EAT HERE!!!
5 I had a great experience with takeout here.  Mostly it was because the food was inexpensive and delicious...what's more to say!  Do yourself a favor and enjoy the Vietnamese spring rolls.  They are $4.95 for two huge rolls packed with cilantro, lettuce, and shrimp, served with yummy peanut sauce.  I have not yet found a place in Vegas that does a better job with true spring rolls--not the fried junk I see on bar menus.
4 Their food is made fresh as soon as you order!  Therefore if you are wanting fast Chinese food like China a gogo or Panda Express which tastes like junk, don't come here. The wait is worth it here! I call my order in, even if I'm going to eat in the restaurant about 10-15 minutes before I arrive to give them a chance to have it ready or get my order in before others.  Their Chicken Noodle Pho Soup is delicious!!!! I eat it at least once a week! The only reason I give them 4 stars is because about 4 times out of 40 plus visits that I've order the Pho soup they must have ran out of cilantro and instead of getting more or informing you that they are out (what is Pho Soup without cilantro??) they just pack it up without and you are disappointed when you get home. At least you could stop and buy your own if they let you know they ran out.  That's my only complaint and that's very minimal for the amount of times I have had their Pho.
4 My boyfriend first discovered this hole in the wall because it was right next to Smiths, however it's an awesome thing he did because I LOVE the food there. I'm not big fan of Chinese food but this place changed my perception for the better. The lunch special that they have is really cheaper and you get a lot of bang for your buck. Depending on what main entrée you get it can range from $6.00 per plate to about $12.00, the meal includes soup of the day, the entrée, egg roll, and a huge helping of their amazing fried rice and the best part it actually comes with either iced/hot green tea with free refills. I personally like the basil chicken, it was large pieces of chicken as well as fresh vegetables.   I've tired many pho places and Jasmine Express has a legit broth which as you probably know with pho is a key element in the pho. I found it to be flavorful and I enjoyed every bite.
5 I wanted crab fried rice but they use the face stuff so I pass on it. I'm not sure who the guy was working behind the counter but he suggested  I try their dinner special rock crab with salt and pepper for $14.00This had to be on of the best dishes I ever eaten! The portions was huge,If I was back in jersey and or something like this it would have cost more line $25. This was the best $14 I ever spent!!
1 DO NOT EAT HERE...HEALTH HAZARD!!!! My water glass had 2 jagged cracks/chips on the rim, and the waitress didn't care, or offer me a new one. The orange chicken was rock hard, I actually could not force a fork to go through it, and it was in a dirty brown, obviously burnt sauce that had a stale, foul smell to it. The fried rice was so hard you may have thought it was just uncooked, but because the possibly peas and carrots were the same suspicious color as the burnt rice, you knew it had been re-heated repeatedly. From the entire terrible meal, I strongly believe they heat, and reheat, over and over again the food. I tried to explain to the server that I could not eat the food, and to please take it off of my bill. She started screaming! "We have this problem ALL the time! ALL the time the people do not want their food and they do not want to pay for it. You pay or we call police." I really wanted to wait for the police, so I would have an incident report to go along with my complaint to the Health Department...however I had an appointment to get to, and I am very embarrassed to admit I paid for this awful, days old food. I would NEVER eat here again, even if it was free.
4 I was very very surprised with my food the last time I came here. I was struggling between Beef noodle soup, special combination pho or wor wonton soup. I wanted something with udon type noodles but wanted something of the pho flavor. I was aware that udon noodles was $2.00 extra but it wasn't offered with the pho soup. I ended up getting the beef noodle soup. A lady brought out my soup which I'm assuming was the cook and she was apologizing for it being awhile but I didn't mind. The soup had such great flavor and was a bit spicy which I really liked. I enjoy spicy food and always choose something with heat anyway. I did add the bean sprouts and jalapeños before I even tasted the soup but I don't think that caused all the heat. The noodles actually complimented the whole dish so I didn't care about udon type noodles anymore. There was also big chunks of beef and fat which added so much flavor. I was soo delighted and happy with my meal. I complained to my friend how whenever I eat out I'm never quite satisfied with what I order lately, and this night I WAS satisfied lol. The waiter was really nice and was aware of when we would need water or anything else. Pretty good service and excellent food. Definitely a hole in the wall Chinese & Vietnamese restaurant. I'd recommend any day! Btw, try their Thai tea! It's deelish! :D   Not completely 5 stars because when we first walked in the cashier/waiter gave us a look then he asked if we were eating in or for take out. That look just threw me off.
3 Food is great. Customer service... not so much.
4 I really like this place when I need to satisfy my Pho kick! The Pho is always delicious, and ordering pick up is always very quick. I always order a Thai iced tea with boba and usually they are on point, but this time it seems that they have switched their boba. The boba instead of being the large balls are now the small tiny ones. Still good none the less, I just prefer the normal boba size balls.
5 My boyfriend and I were hungry and it was my turn to choose the spot to eat. I've been telling him how good this place was and after his first time eating from here, he didn't quite like it. Mind you it was a pick-up order and he had ordered something he's never tried before. Shrimp Tom Yum soup! It wasn't my favorite either. But I enjoyed my Beef noodle soup as always.  Anyways, he wanted to go to Aliante buffet for the fact that it's cheap and right up the street from us but I convinced him to try this place out again. The service was good as always, we got to choose where to sit and was given enough time to order.   I got the lunch special Kung Pao chicken and my absolute fave, their Thai tea! Even my boyfriend loves it. I swear it's the best Thai tea we've ever had!! He chose Curry chicken and ordered an appetizer as well, chicken wings. To be honest when I read how much it was for 3 chicken wings I was kinda let down. But once the food came we were NOT disappointed! My food was very good. I was already full after eating about a fourth of my meal. I did have the egg drop soup prior. The curry chicken was very good also. And the chicken wings were actually whole wings! I was so surprised lol. They were still very hot when we ate them. The wings were crispy, moist, very well cooked and even a little sweet..I don't know how but it was. I'm just happy my boyfriend enjoyed his food. He even brought the leftovers with him to work :D   Everyone I have introduced this place to has enjoyed their food. This really is a hole in the wall restaurant that not many people know about. The prices are also very reasonable as well.
1 Was craving pho wasn't really in the mood to drive all the way across town so I decided to give this place a try...but this has to be the most disgusting experience I've had at a restaurant!!! The noodles in the phó were hard as a rock...and the sprouts were brown!! And the broth..i can't even describe how bad it was it all lacked flavor!! this place needs some serious help! Do yourselves a favor and never eat here!!
5 Came here today for some boba tea unfortunately they didn't have any made so I tried the kiwi pearls in my mango and strawberry smoothie...it was *bomb* I loved it. I still like boba but the pearls are yummy to. I give this place a 5 star and recommend you guys to try the smoothies with pearls. :)
3 Service was good, place was clean. The food menu has great selection but i will say the taste is ok but "HANDS DOWN" to their pho soup!!! worth of a drive if you're in the north side & craving for pho soup noodles . Will be back only for that.
5 Me and my girlfriend come all the time, since we moved. It's really close to our house and it has awesome boba and food! it also has a lot of choice and options :) yum
2 If you want pho.... Don't get it here. Staff is friendly and helpful but food is not up to par. Tastes like the broth was made from bouillon cubes.
4 The customer service was awesome.   They give you free crab rangoon with each order of pot stickers. i didn't know that!   Thank god, they deliver! They delivered less than estimated time, which is a plus!  Their boba slush is alright. This isn't the best oriental cuisine I've had, but it was satisfying. Good food.   Crab fried rice however is awesome.
4 The best way I can describe this place is that it's a Chinese/Thai/Vietnamese fusion type of restaurant. You can get Chow Mein, Pad Thai, or Pho.   My wife shared a bowl of beef pho with my youngest son. My oldest son got the pork vermicelli bowl. I got the lunch special which came with hot or iced tea, eggflower soup, an eggroll, fried rice, and entrée of your choice from a list. I chose sweet n sour pork.   The beef pho was good. Since we ordered it plain, for my youngest, it was just like chicken noodle soup but with beef instead. The vermicelli was ok. Nothing to rave about. Now my lunch special was pretty good. They give you a nice bowl of eggflower soup. I chose iced tea for my drink. I think it was jasmine. It was very strong. If you refer to my pic, the fried rice that came with my sweet n sour pork was very good. The eggroll I think was a combination pork and vegetable. I would say it was a good deal for 6 bucks.  Service was ok. We were taken care of by one server. Even though the place was a bit busy, we got our food in a timely manner. It just took a while to get our refills a couple times.  Some random info: 2 free eggrolls on check in. Free wifi. Password is express7. Lunch specials are everyday from 11 am to 4 pm. Don't forget about the various boba drinks you can order. Apparently a lot of people come here just for those drinks! When we were eating our meal, at least 4 people came in just for those drinks alone! So it must be good. Next time we will try one.  Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #75
1 If a negative review was possible, I would give this restaurant one! Coming from out of town, I wanted to try this place out. MAN!!!!!!! That was a BIG MISTAKE! I found it convenient and order the food through yelp and set the food to be picked up at 7:30 pm. I received a voice message from a rude employee at 7:17 pm, informing me my food was ready to be picked up, but yet, I set the pick up at 7:30! I called the restaurant back and the rude employee answered. I explained, I would be there shortly. Upon arrival, the rude idiot asked me "why you late fo yo pick up?!?!?" I replied, "my order was set at 7:30, to pick up!" He answered back "well..... We make it at 7:00" (pointless stupid coment) while he was explaining, he looked to the detailed invoice of my order and circled the time its set to be picked up and said "see it say seven.......... Oh?" Immediately, the employee felt completely DUMB! Instead of apologizing, the employee blatantly covered his IGNORANCE for arrogance! I asked "well.... Dont you think the food is cold by now?" In his immediate defense, he pointlessly started check marking specific foods on the invoice of items I ordered, on what items would be warm or not (AGAIN, stupidity at its best!) I would of accepted his apology and went about my night, but since this moron was spitting pointless nonsense-full verbiage, to make him look more dumber than he really is! This made me immensely frustrated and was seriously considering throwing the food in his face. I arrived to North LV, from a long drive from Californian and all I wanted to do was eat. This person is the face of this establishment and SHOULD really consider pulling the stick out of his ass, for the customers and business sake. Over all, the food was ok and nothing out of the ordinary. YELPERS, STAY AWAY FROM THIS BUSINESS. If you dont mind being treated rude and would consider mundane food; that would be totally up to you!
3 Delicious smoothies!! Yummy!!  I have tríed both honeydew and the coconut smoothies!! I Will be trying the yellow curry chicken today.
4 Love their fruit smoothies.... super refresh and the boba... Gee. So bomb.  Save trip to China town and with the fruit makes me wanna it everyday.. You can adjust your sweetness. Let them know
5 They have boba milk teas here in North Las vegas.   Eddie was excellent cashier. Bogo on milk teas and smoothies (:
2 So the boba here is good, depending on who makes it. The food is hit or miss depending on what time of day you get it. I usually get Pad Thai here and sometimes it's fantastic, sometimes you wonder what the hell they put in it. Needless to say, I got food poisoning this last time around so I think I'll just stick to the boba. Other than that, the staff is pretty cool. It'll do in a pinch.
5 Their Vietnamese dishes are on point; vermicelli, pho, and rice plates. The smoothies are also on point. Everything else, from what I've tried; Chinese dishes (orange chicken, lemon chicken, shumai), Thai dishes (curry, pad thai), aren't all that great. The spring rolls, egg rolls, pork buns and sesame balls are pretty awesome too.
5 Let me start by saying that I have no idea why this place has so many negative reviews. So, if you're considering going here, but hesitant because of the reviews, I challenge you to try it. You won't regret it.   With that being said, as I pulled up to Jasmine Express, I was a little worried because of the cigar store next door. When I tried Viet Bistro at Tenaya and Lake Mead, it was disgusting because of the cigar smell. But anyways, as I walked in, I was greeted immediately. I ordered a milk tea boba and redeemed my free eggrolls coupon for my Yelp check-in to start. Very prompt service. My boyfriend and I both ordered Pho, as he was not feeling well. I got the rare steak pho. It was absolutely amazing. The flavor was incredible.   I have ZERO complaints about this place. I will definitely be back, sooner rather than later. So glad I finally found a place I can get pho that's not all the way in China town.
4 Fist time back in a longggg time! Ordered the pho. Must say it has improved big time! Is it new ownership?? I dunno but I like it and I'll be back!
3 Jasmine Express is a hole in the wall restaurant that's half restaurant,  half counter service taking to-go orders. I had the braised tofu and it was a bit on the chewy side but still good.    There was 3 people in our party and the orders came out separately.  The beverages are served in cans but you get refills.  The waiter was attentive and kept the refills coming.  The prices are pretty reasonable as well.   We'll be returning to this restaurant!  I'll probably order something different though...
4 I wasnt a big fan of pho...but this place changed my mind. I USUALLY just drive here but it can be a hassle finding seats since it is small, but now they do online ordering and delivery. Wayyy more convenient for me. I definately recommend the smoothies and the pho...coconut and pineapple is my fav!!!
1 I have been going here since 2008 when I moved to the area. slow but steadily has gone down. if you order pan fried noodle you get chow main Noddles. wasn't always the case. I see it say they don't use msg but you can clear taste the msg especially in the fried rice. the service is actual very good but the food is not any better than panda Express.
3 Three solid stars for the taste of the food alone. Chicken pad thai was a bit on the sweet side for me but noodles were cooked perfectly and portions were huge. The pork pad se eww...hands down one of the best dishes like this that I have had. I could have eaten this for days. The meat was hearty and there was plenty of it. I will return for the food.   They also have smoothies and boba here. The avacado smoothie was sooooo yummy! Get one!   I could have gone one more star but we waited for 25 min for a to go order...we were the only people in there. The chef made out order wrong and we had to wait longer. In that time I noticed the place could use a deep clean...it's also not in a great part of north Las Vegas so the sidewalk foot traffic was a bit sketchy.   Check in on yelp and get 2 free veggie rolls!!
3 I feel terrible giving them 3 stars, since the waiter was over the top amazing! The food however, wasn't 'bad' , but my husband order basil chicken and I ordered another chicke dish ... it they both had the same flavor, as did the chicken lettuce wraps. :( The Tum Yum was spicy, but not much flavor. Bummer, as I live right down the street and have been dying to find a good Thai place.
5 I've been to this place a couple times now and it's always great! They have very friendly service and great food! I've had the seafood pho both times and the aroma & flavor if the broth is the best I've had!
5 Love this place!  Ate some great Chinese food.  Getting boba as well.  Service is awesome!  Crab rangoons and Szechuan eggplant always yummy!  Their pho here is great too.  Good price and big portions.  Oh and finishing off with the snow cream.  Love that stuff!
3 I'm very conflicted with this place. The food is great, this is the only Pho place close by and that is somewhat decent. Rare Steak Pho is really delicious when I don't want to drive across time for my favorite place.  The service here is usually awful. I've waited for half an hour for a to go order when I have had people come after me get their order quicker.  I have never dined in, but from the look and the wait I witnessed it wasn't all that great. One time they had a woman who seemed almost completely knew trying to work the register by herself and taking 8 minutes to ring up an order, she had to grab a cook's help to finish it out.  The regular guy I see that takes orders can be a bit rude. I've been placed on hold for over ten minutes with him to then have to call back.  I have also ordered to go some Pho and Fried Rice, literally he said 'not a problem, we are out of pho since over half an hour.' How is this not a problem?  I also always order my Pho without bean sprouts, he has questioned me as if why I would ever do such a thing and then time after time there are always bean sprouts.  But yet I keep coming back because it is close and pretty good food. They definitely need better help though.
1 My family and I had lunch there today and I ordered szcuan beef and the meat and rice were old and I took my food back and they didn't want to refund my money so I decieded to warn every one.
5 Didn't eat here, but we bought boba smoothies, and they were fantastic! Tons of choices!  Start at $3.50 - 5.75  fresh!
