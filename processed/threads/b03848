1 If someone at this restaurant is willing to do this to a Sheriff Deputy, do you REALLY think an average customer would fair any better?! - - - - - - - - - - - - - Maricopa County Sheriff deputies felt threatened and concerned that a Pei Wei employee might tamper with their food when they were ordering during a recent food break.   A manager remarked that the deputies were responsible for arresting too many of the kitchen staff at the restaurant.  It was suggested the manager who made the comment may have been referencing MCSO's recent crackdown on illegal immigration.  According to the Sheriff, the Pei Wei employee proceeded to offer to cook "something special" for the deputies.  The deputies, according to the Sheriff, felt threatened by the remark and returned their food, worried about food contamination.

4 It was one of those lazy nights and we wanted something quick to eat. The place was surprisingly  busy. It's off of Shea Blvd. I don't order their noodles because the last time I had them, they were over cooked. The food came out HOT and we shared our plates. I ended up taking the leftovers home and had another meal the following day.
5 I eat here often and the food is very good.  Service is good and atmosphere is good.  If you have to get in and out and don't want a drive through...this is the best choice!  Tony
2 ************** No Wei *************  Why ........I can never get excited about eating here.    The pot stickers ....... are always fried to "DEATH".       The entrees ......... are always SAUCE-LESS.           Vegetables ...... must be priceless ....... Zero to none in most entrees                Entrees ........ ALL TASTE ALIKE....excessive spiciness                     You can count on ......... your ENTIRE ORDER arriving at once ....                         meaning, soup, pot stickers and entree.   Oh Well ....... My Wife will allow me to avoid this disappointment for..... another  6 months.                                        Folk's ....... there's better out-there ..... THIS IS NOT THE WEI TO GO
4 We have enjoyed going to Pei Wei for several years now, ever since PF Chang started  rolling out the concept nationally.   The food is really good and the selection from different Asian cultural foods is outstanding -- they serve Thai, Korean, and of course Chinese.  If you have never been to a Pei Wei think Panda Express with a more upscale menu and  a sit-down atmosphere for a modest price.  A good example was our dinner last evening.  We came in around 5 pm, there was already a dozen or so patrons there.  We ordered their new three choice combo meal and soup and the bill came in for less then $20.00.  One of the managers came by to check if everything was prepared to liking and everything was delicious.   Nice!  Go!  Enjoy!
4 The customer service at this location is great!  They have really stepped up their game after many years of struggling.  Because Fountain Hills is really limited in healthy dining out choices, I find my family here multiple times per week sometimes.  The cost is reasonable, the food comes out fresh and fast so the kids don't get restless and we have food choices on the healthier side.  I LOVE the Lemongrass Chicken Salad.    One compliant...they need to do something about the varnish coming off on the tables.  It makes it feel like the tables are still dirty even though I saw them clean them.
1 I have ordered take-out twice from the location in Fountain Hills, on both occassions my order was messed up. I'm in shock!  A shrimp dinner velveted, turned out to be a dry chicken dinner even though my receipt said Shrimp Velveted. This time, I ordered Carmel chicken and I received the correct meal with No  Vegetables!!, no slaw, very little sauce and $10 poorer!! The coke was good though. I love Pei Wei, but the Fountain Hills location is truely just embarassing for the reputation of the Food Chain. Too bad, really. Waste of Money!!-Jessica H.
