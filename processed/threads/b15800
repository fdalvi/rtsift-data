3 Cleaner than average, nice decor, friendly and pleasant staff, new massage chairs. $20 for a pedicure (20% off of $25 due to new ownership), $10 extra for a "deluxe pedi" that includes hot towels and an exfoliating mask. My only complaints are that they shave your heals without asking and trim the sides of your nails to prevent ingrowns- really ugly. Also, not the best paint job I've received. Good option for when you find yourself in North LV.
5 Much better job than Euphoria.  They worked hard in my calus areas and they did an excellent job on my brows.  I have returned repeatedly with the same results.  Although thr sign said $10 extra for hot towels, they used them free of charge.  Highly recommended.
1 Came here with a friend to get a mani pedi done & we didn't have an appointment, but when a walked in they told us very rudely that they didn't have time for both of us, only one. They didn't even ask what we were there for. They had maybe 3 people in the shop on a Sunday. Needless to say not recommending this shop. Never will be going back.
