4 This is a beautiful store located at the beautiful Kierland Commons. I have to admit I was in and out in less than 1 minute, but the store was a good size and the staff was attentive. There was a huge variety of items, but alas.... NO PET ACCESSORIES!   pawshi looks so cute in Juicy Couture!!
5 I found a light aqua blue T shirt for less than 14 bucks here. (Super comfy and I love the color) Also, found 3 bundle logo hairties for 6 bucks a bundle.  Staff was attentive, informative, and outgoing.
