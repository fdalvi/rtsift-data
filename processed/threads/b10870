4 We stayed here list year (Nov 2011) my dad and I both really liked it.   The WiFi is a bit spotty, do bring a signal amplifier if you have one.  The restrooms are spectacular! I was dying to try out their salt water pool,  but sadly, it was closed.  Its a higher price at about $35Ishtar a night and is north of downtown Las Vegas.  It was really nice and is pet friendly with a tiny dog walk area.  The mini golf is not worth mentioning as it's smaller than the size of a super compact car.   Totally recommend this park.  You can easily find cheaper if you look but this is one of the nicer resorts we have been to.
2 Pros:  Clean.  Decent amenities.  Seems secure.  Cons: WiFi is non existent.  Neighborhood around the park is less than desirable.
4 Clean, quiet, nice people, wonderful pool!   Far enough away from the Las Vegas Hustle, but close enough to be accessible to all the nightlife.  The RV park is gated with remotes for tenants.  The bathrooms were clean and secure.  The showers were great with enough room to maneuver.  The saltwater swimming pool was inviting and aways cleaned every morning.  There are two dog runs and a doggie bath area.  I would give the Hitchin' Post RV Park 5 stars if there was some sort of shade (netting) over the pool (really too hot in Vegas to spend mid-day in the pool).
