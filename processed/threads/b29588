3 I ain't much of a soda (or Pop if y'all call it that) drinker but ever once in awhile, generally when it's hotter'n hot, I get me a hankerin' fer a big 'ole drank a soda pop.  That's when you can find me sidled on up to the wall o' carbonated glory at this here Circle K. 'Round these parts a small is 32 ounces and that's just fer lily-livered city weasels.  The only other sizes are 44 ounces and 64 ounces. That's how we roll in these here dusty corners of the Valley of the Sun.
4 Nice. Clean. Pretty much always busy, as it's the only gas station for a few miles around.
3 I've been going here for the past 9+ years and it's pretty much the basic local circle-K. Not much to say past that. I do dig the walk-in beer cooler but also wonder who in the hell buys the bags of bananas?
4 Very clean!
4 it feels odd to write a review about a convenience store... BUT, this place stood out in my mind. Unlike EVERY OTHER Circle K I've been to, they are actually clean inside and have respectable looking employees that are nice and friendly to you.  Honestly, I only have come to expect that from QT employees... so, kudos to this location for being clean, feeling safe, always open, and still hiring good, decent people to operate it.
4 For a circle K this place has it going on 2nd Circle K that has impressed me. It's close to home so I drop in for a little H2O or the occasional snack.....
4 Love the coffee at this store.  Service is usually good, especially by a select few.  They could do a much better job keeping the place clean and fresh coffee always made in the mornings.  The polar pop club is a great deal also.
