1 Let me start with the fact that I love Old Navy, over the years I've been able to find some great deals.    My problem with this Old Navy is customer service.  I had an employee complain to be about organizing racks, when I talked to the manager I was offered, and I quote "$5 appeasement bucks".  Basically there strategy is to give me $5 to shut up, not a good customer service plan Old Navy.
4 I love Old Navy. They have great deals. The only complaint is that you have to use the Old Navy card to use the coupons they send out.
3 Wife wanted some flip flops while on vacation so Old Navy here we come. Of course we get those and a few other things. The security guard hiding behind all the racks was a little weird.
4 Nice store, friendly staff. Came in here to use my free cash from a previous purchase. Got some workout gear and outfits for the hubby and girls.   Taking out one star because they didn't have a lot of my size (s) but just happy my girls got to pick out their own outfits and it didn't break the bank! :) will be back for summer clothes soon!
