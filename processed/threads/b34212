5 Love this tanning salon. Top of the line beds. Knowledgeable and friendly staff. Decently priced :)
5 First off I'd like to mention the owner, Eunice of Eunique Tan not only is attentive but she explains all the products and services thoroughly.  Top notch machines and products that make you feel like you are getting a full spa experience.  The hydration station is a must, especially after a long tan.  My tan lasted longer with the hydration station.  Love them!!
5 I travel to and from Los Angeles a lot for work. I ONLY GO TO EuniQue Tan when in AZ. I LOVE the staff and the way the salon is ran. Very friendly, super clean and long lasting, fast results!!! My color lasts and I feel like a goddess. I get lots of compliments. Products are amazing because I don't leave smelling bad and my skin doesn't clog. The owner is very beautiful and super friendly which adds to the "EuniQue" experience. All the women in my family go here;)
1 Closed down? I just renewed my membership with a 6 month commitment about a month ago, I went by after being away for a week and the place was cleaned out, looks like they went out of business. Even if they were moving or renovating, they never let me know. Shitty.
1 Curious to where they moved to? Just spend a lot of money on a 6 month package a week before they moved and have no idea to when they will be up and running or where they re located??? Would have been nice to know they were moving when i signed up. Tanning season is here and I cant do anything about it.
