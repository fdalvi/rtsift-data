4 Zehrs is the local incarnation of the Loblaws family of grocery stores.  This location has actually gone through some upgrades and expansions in recent years, resulting in a larger and brighter-looking store.  This Zehrs at Glenridge Plaza in Waterloo is one of my favourites, but not for the reasons you might normally think....  I love this store for the awesome sales that we get here from time to time that are not part of the normal sales for the rest of the stores in the chain.  Meats, Prepared Food, Salads, Sundries, there are some fantastic deals to be had if you are willing to stalk the store at the right times (late in the evening or early in the morning).
5 Best big-box grocery place in Waterloo! This Zehrs has wonderful meat and seafood as well as a wide variety of produce, a well-stocked olive bar, and tons of great sales.
3 This is one of the smallest Zehrs in the region but it has everything most customers wouldl want.  Great selection in the natural foods section.  Only missing department is Joe Fresh but there is no room for them.  If you're a fan of JF check out the Superstore on Highland or Stanley Park Mall Zehrs.
