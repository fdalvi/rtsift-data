5 Excellent service, I will use every time.   My phone would no longer charge, I stopped in at 10:30am and they were able to fix it by 10:45am. It was a broken port, the entire phone had to be taken apart however he was quick and polite.   The cost for repair was way below my expectations. Two thumbs up.
5 dropped off my iPad 2 to replace the glass screen digitizer. great prices for all devices, not just iPads. these guys did a great job and it was ready in 1 day. I would recommend this place for all glass replacements. my iPad looks brand new like the day I bought it.
5 My iPhone was smashed up real bad. I brought it here and now it's back to perfect, and for much cheaper than I could find anywhere else. The repair was done in thirty minutes while I waited in an chilled waiting room with a tv, comfy couch, and Internet access. A 3 month warranty was included for free as well. This is my first review because up until now, I just used yelp to look up places. I'm super happy with the work so I wanted to write a proper review.
