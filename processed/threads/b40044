5 Always done in less than an hour usually 1/2 hour or less. Always decent customer service. They don't answer the phone so don't bother calling just go in. Small selection of accessories for phones. I've been told they are more expensive than most in the area but I believe you get what you pay for. So far 3 out of 3 times they've treated me well & done a great job!
5 Friendly staff, great service! They had the right screen for my phone (HTC One X Plus) It was ready the next day, I'm really happy with it!
1 I have had a completely unprofessional and poor experience with this business. One month ago I had started a prepaid service at this business. I went in to pay the bill (they accept only cash or debit card). The person behind the desk has to key in the payment to another place (done on his personal cell). He repeated the number and was 1 digit off from the number that I was attempting to pay and have credited. I said "No it is XXXX." He told me not to correct him, he had been doing this for 10 years. I apologized and said I just wanted to be sure the correct account received credit. He told me I had an attitude and could take my business elsewhere.   I had opened this account for a secondary phone and had been waited on by "Tom" who was very helpful, professional. Obviously, service like this makes it doubtful that they will remain in business.
