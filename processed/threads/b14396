5 Let me explain the 5 stars... I'm from southern california... all the wal-marts are gross and dirty. The associates are rude and generally aren't there to help you. You literally feel like you have to take a shower after you get out of the wal-mart. Dirty kids running everywhere with no parent in sight...   That wasn't the case with this one. The husband and I decided to go here primarily for groceries. I was in such shock when i walked in and cashiers were there standing and smiling, asking if they could help us!  There were associates actually doing their job, instead of chit chating! The carts were moderately cleaned too!   This was a good experience at the Wally-World. Normally I shop at the local targets, however, with this wal-mart I  might just go back!
5 I shop here for everything.  Food prices are way lower than anywhere else and store is clean and well stocked. My FAVORITE store!
5 On days when my Lexapro/Wellbutrin cocktail isn't working, before I begin frantically searching through my wife's popular hiding places for my shotgun shells, I take a deep breath and come here. Wal-Mart Supercenter. Wal-Mart is where I normalize, using its patrons as sort of a wellness gauge.   I walk in, battered and bruised from the rigors of everyday living, Chief Raincloud if you will, and within minutes, sashay out like an animated Disney character who just drank a fifth of Fireball!  Yes, the customers frequenting Wal-Mart help me to understand how my life really isn't all that fucked-up after all.  Thank you Wal-Mart. And THANK-YOU, all you fucked-up, societal asswarts!
