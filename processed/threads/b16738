4 OK, where are all the peeps?  This place is empty, and that is fine by me.  1.  Normally buy my running shoes at Village Runner.  2.  However, last pair, I did not get support I needed as it supported supination too much.  3.  I did not know what was wrong.  4.  At Foot Solutions, they will analyze your walk and etc and get you into the right shoes.  I am very happy with my current pair.  5. Pricing - Okay, perhaps 7-8 % more expensive than Amazon, yet Amazon cannot analyze what you need in a shoe.  6.  Selection - small but enough.    7.  Service - this is the key. You can buy shoes from everywhere and for cheap. Getting the RIGHT shoe for you is difficult and this is where Foot Solutions is on top of their game.  Go for it.
5 Great service.  These people know what they are doing when it comes to foot health.  I work on my feet all day - and they are HAPPY FEET now!!  Thanks DeWitt!!!
4 My wife needed new shoes and Foot Solutions in Summerlin had closed.  We went here yesterday and she got the shoes she wanted.  The person who helped her was very thorough and professional.  When I checked in on Yelp, I saw there was a Yelp deal.  It turns out to be a $15 discount on what you buy.  When I knew she had found something she wanted, I bought the deal and redeemed it a few minutes later!  Pretty slick, Yelp and good advertising Foot Solutions.  One other thing, we were told that this store was in a plaza 1/2 mile from where it really was.  When I couldn't find it in the first mall, I pulled it up on Yelp and I let the map lead me there.  All in all, I'm a fan.
5 Great service! All the employees are very knowledgable! Owners are the nicest people and so great with customers! I got custom orthotics made in the store and they were finished 30 min later! It was a fast and easy process! They were able to fix all the pains and problems with my feet! GREAT PLACE!!!!
