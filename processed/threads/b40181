5 This Starbucks knows what they are doing! I Just ordered my first pumpkin spice chai of the season and it was amazing! Kimmy provided excellent customer service as always and I will definitely be a regular at the store!  This is a new Starbucks and business tends to fluctuate so check the line before you commit to the drive-thru if you're in a hurry.  You may need to go inside for faster service!
4 I am definitely a Starbucks girl! I love this new Starbucks because it is in the way to my church and it has the drive thru option! The baristas are super friendly and always get my order right. Only thing I don't like is that I have to go out of my way to get in and out of their parking lot. Other than that, it's my new favorite Starbucks!
2 This particular Starbucks is having difficulty managing how busy they are. Please HQ send a specialist to help with the looooong wait times. I've been at busier Starbucks before and they do a better job. The staff here is under trained and not your typical happy Starbucks employees. Disappointed for now.
5 This Starbucks has it going on! The staff was so nice and very fast! I ordered a secret menu Butterbeer and they made it perfect! We really needed a Starbucks in this area! I am so glad we got all these friendly people to go with it. This location was even doing a community craft night tonight. Who does that? I love it! Keep doing what you do!!
