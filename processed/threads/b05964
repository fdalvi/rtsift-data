5 We were recently in Las Vegas for a convention and used Las Vegas Color Graphics to print 3'x5' mounted posters. Dean and his team really went above and beyond providing excellent service. They were available 7 days a week and even delivered the artwork to our hotel on a Saturday morning!! Not to mention the quality of the product was fantastic & the prices were competitive!
5 A friend of mine has referred them to me. It was pretty hard finding this place as there is no real sign outside. Outside of the little squiggly line at the top center of the building, no real identifying markers.   I come here for large quantity of prints for cardstock flyers. They do an amazing job and have wonderful staff here! The quality is amazing and they are very reasonable with their prices. I think I've gotten over 100,000 flyers from them in the last year for various things that require marketing.   I'm overall satisfied and couldn't do a better job myself!
5 I am so happy with my business with Las Vegas color graphics. The original company that was going to print my wedding invites fell though last minute and I was in a panic. Las Vegas color graphics promised to get the job faster than any other place in town I had called. They also did it for cheaper. My invites are beautiful and I got them when they promised! They were a real life saver!
