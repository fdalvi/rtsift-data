5 This is the best place I have found to get cards, the prices really do put Clinton's and Birthdays to shame.  First of all, I don't like birthday cards, I really don't 'get' them. I would much rather a cheery birthday phone call or a visit around my house. Unfortunately most people feel that not sending a card to a loved one is a sign of disrespect and I am therefore morally obligated to do so. For too long I had been using Clintons and Birthdays to purchase my cards and the prices really are extortionate for a tiny piece of paper.   Card Factory however makes card purchasing that so much cheaper, you can get cards for 29p and not even the silly ones with bears, the cards are simplistic and not full of clich√©d lovey-dovey phrases.What I tend to do is do a yearly shop of cards full all my relatives and close mates so that I don't have to pop out every now and then for the rest of the year. The Card Factory also make it cheaper for you to do this by giving you money off for the more cards you buy!
