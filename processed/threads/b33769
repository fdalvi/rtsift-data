4 They had a lot of great surf stuff here! I was surprised, given that it is Vegas, and there is no ocean in sight. I'm used to the awesome surf shops in Hawai'i.   Great selection of all sorts of stuff. Got my husband his favorite kind of organic cotton shirt from Billabong. Loved all the ladies gear and swimsuits. Will be back to pick up more stuff next time I'm in Vegas.  The staff was very helpful. Since I am short, they helped me get stuff that was out of my reach!
4 My husband loves Ron Jon Surf Shops as it reminds him of his childhood growing up in Santa Monica.  We had to come here to get our daughter a shirt from Ron Jon Las Vegas while staying at the Luxor. Being a tourist area, a 2T shirt was about $15 but why not. They had some other really cute women's clothes in there too. Added plus, they threw in a few stickers.
5 I am a Florida gal born and raised and have been a fan of Ron Jons' for EVER and always stop in when I see one when I am traveling, SO....I stopped in after seeing a show at Mandalay Bay and of course had to buy another tshirt! Great little store, super friendly staff BUT----wen I returned home and washed my shirt, the color ran and my shirt was ruined!! =( (1st time that EVER happened!) So I sent an email to the store and the mgr Eric replied like right away!! And he took it upon himself to send me a FREE replacement shirt just like what I bought!! Now thats customer service!! If you like RJ like me, you MUST visit this shop!!! Thanks Ron Jon, you rock as usual!!
3 Not sure why a surf shop is needed in the middle of the desert.  Maybe because you can surf in the monster pool at the Mandalay Bay.  It is really no different from the other chain stores that you can see in Hawaii or on the coast of California.
