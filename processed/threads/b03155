4 Had a blast. The friendliest people. A great way to spend a afternoon. I'm from Texas and they made me feel right at home.
4 Great dive bar!  The band is always on point and the drinks are always strong!  Would rate a 5 star if they'd start serving food.  They do have popcorn though which is a plus!
4 A friend of mine lives over in Queen Creek and is always raving about this place - we stopped in and wow, was it friendly.  I almost felt like I was walking onto a set for Cheers ... people coming up and introducing themselves and even a few hugs.  Pretty cool.  They have 4 pool tables so I am a big fan of that.  Lots of popcorn and great drinks!  I would love it if they added some food, esp. hot links ... nothing is better than hot links served at a bar.
