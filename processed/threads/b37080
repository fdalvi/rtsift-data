3 I work in this building, so it makes sense that I end up here a lot.    They do a light breakfast---  coffee, tea, breakfast sandwiches, fruit cups, croissants, and bagels.  (gotham bagels!)   I love coming here for a quick bite to eat in the mid morning.     Lunch can be hit or miss, especially with their specials.  They serve a lot of sandwiches, soups, and simple pasta dishes.  Most entrees are between $7-8.   This place loves bacon.  Loves it.  If there's a sliver of an opportunity that they can add bacon to something, you'll get it.  And a lot of it.  Their salads are an amazing value.  They're large and well crafted.  I always get the small size and it's plenty.... you'd have to be really hungry to finish the large.  I keep coming back for the staff.  They're friendly and always having a good time.
5 I have no clue how this place only has 3 stars. I come here at least 2 times a week for their $5 salads... and they're not just lettuce, tomato, and a sprinkle of cheese. They're loaded with toppings, that usually include a meat. Their sandwiches are also a good size, all for under $9 and they include a side like pasta salad or potato salad (not the usual bag of Lays).  OH, and the staff are phenomenal. They have a punch card where if you buy ten meals your eleventh is free for up to $12, and they won't let you leave until you've spent all twelve of those dollars. Even if you don't want anything else right then, "well, take a cookie home for later".   My only problem is that they're not open on Saturday or Sunday, and they don't do dinner. Sometimes I have a Friday night hankerin' for a BBQ ranch chicken salad, and I have to wait until Monday.
