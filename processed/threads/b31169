5 I have been doing business with Foothills Garage Door and am very pleased with the service that I have received. Steve is honest and points out the options with no pressure to make a decision immediately. He is timely and lets me know that he is on his way. He cleans up and even takes the trash with him.He takes pride in his business and I would recommend him highly to other customers.
5 We called Steve at Foothills Garage Door for an emergency situation.  He gave us an honest estimate (no emergency weekend charge, either) and even reduced the charge when he realized it wasn't as difficult as he first thought.  I am very pleased with the service and won't call anyone else.  I'm proud to support local businesses.  Steve is very professional and knowledgeable.  I would recommend him highly.
5 My garage door spring broke this morning, and was trapped in my garage.  I called and left a message, and received a call within 10 minutes.  Someone was here to fix my issue in an hour, and the price was fair, and everyone I dealt with was courteous and professional.  I got a very good first impression of this company, and I would highly recommend them.
