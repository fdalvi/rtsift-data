5 Really efficient denny's! Great in a pinch.
4 Great staff, open 24-7, clean, and they have security there at night so when things started to get shaky with certain customers they fix the issue fast
1 Horrible food. It takes real effort to botch up a turkey sandwich...so because of their obvious diligence in that regard, I'm giving them one star.
3 It's Denny's.  What can I say.  Typical chain food.  Service is good.  Kids love it.  Comfortable atmosphere.  Prices are low.
1 For starters, this place has a very strong moldy smell to it. From looking at the old stained carpets, this seems where it may be comming from.  Next, I ordered a soda and my glass was dirty and had oily stains from it.  I've been to other Denny's Resturants, but this by far is the dirtiest establishment I've been to.  I was afraid to try the food, fearing that the Kitchen (shielded from view) would be worse than what customers are able to see.  I would recommend someone inspect the air quality and cleaniness of this establishment.
