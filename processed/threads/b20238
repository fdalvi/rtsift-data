3 A visit to Garibaldi's club requires you take note of the following points:  1: Its best , on entry, to neck at least 5 tequilas and wash this all down with a Corona or eight.  2: Don't get there too early, you'll begin to notice the place is too bright and a bit tacky.  Taking heed of these points will ensure a fun night of liberally boozy cocktails and sizeable jugs of alcoholic concoctions. When its busy the club is a fun place to be, although its best to avoid the odd bruiser swinging on the dance floor's pole. Cheap entry fees and cheery tunes amass to an average club night. A-OK.
4 This place has to be amongst my favourites in Edinburgh, purely because it's just so random!! It's a ski bar, essentially. It's the sort of place I would fully expect to find in a French ski resort, and it has the same atmosphere - fun!! The wooden interior and ski memrobellia make it one of the cooler places to be in Edinburgh.  The best thing is it has amazing cocktails .... Who knew! The raspberry mojoto in particular is a killer. I don't think they measure their alcohol legally, they are so so strong.  They have quite a small dancefloor too, so you can boogie on down till the wee hours. During the festival it's open till 5, like most of the clubs.  My favourite thing about garibaldis is the reaction of my friends when I bring them here. You totally wouldn't expect it to be in Edinburgh!  Although I must admit the entrance fee is a bit hefty - I think it was around Â£8 each. But of you can look past that then it's billiant!
4 If you enjoy Mexican food, you will love Plaza Garibaldi's!   Situated on Hanover Street, Plaza Garibaldi's is right in the centre of the New Town area of Edinburgh, and is just around the corner from the main shopping street, Princes Street, and so it is a convenient place to reach.  It would be so easy to walk straight past this restaurant as it is absolutely tiny from the outside, but it produces the biggest flavours in its meals inside. Plaza Garibaldi's offers a wide range of authentic Mexican dishes including tacos, enchiladas, nachos and dips. I have been here several times for my dinner and I absolutely love their sizzling chicken fajita - just thinking about them is making my mouth water! The chicken is always perfectly cooked and full of flavour and there is platy of guacamole, sour cream and cheese to go with it - they are so yummy! All of their dishes are cooked with really fresh ingredients and they are all full of flavour and pretty spicy. Plaza Garibaldi's make their own corn tortillas which are amazing with the salsa.   The staff in this restaurant are always incredibly warm and welcoming and are very attentive to the customers. The prices are super reasonable here too, with most main dishes costing under ten pounds. A truly great Mexican restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.
3 Again a restaurant I would never ever think of eating in but as a place to let loose its rather famous!  Key point to be aware   - the only measures they have are double - their mojitos have three shots of rum (dark, gold, white) - a jacket left lying around will grow feet and walk away  The music is awesome for letting go of a Friday and welcoming the weekend. The pole at the back of the dance floor is something to be visited for sure for amusement!  Be ware of the bouncers..... they arent that bright and can be heavy handed!  Good times!
3 The bouncer here when I came to the club at night was probably the coolest and friendliest bouuncer I've ever encountered. The music is cheesy and they have a pole in the middle of the dancefloor but if you fancy a fun time, come here!
