5 The assistants are friendly and professional...
5 It's a shame I don't even know the name of the Dr. Who took care of us but he is a pro! I thought gingivectomy was supposed to be painful but no! He numbed 1/2 of my mouth in less than a minute. I've received local anesthesia from several dentists before, but no one was never this good. The procedure was smooth and quick. I usually fear to go back to the dentist but I can't wait for my next appointment. On the other note, they are running 1800/implant which I think is reasonable.
5 I love this office. The staff is very professional and the Doctor listens. I do want to give a personal shout out to Martina the assistant. She is wonderful at what she does. X-rays with her are painless. I highly recommend this Dentist to everyone in the Las Vegas area.
1 This office has the worst customer service I have ever experienced before. I came in for a deep cleaning. I was experiencing pain which is why I called to follow-up with the doctor. He never called me back. The front desk is terrible including the Office manger Evelyn!  The doctor never calls you back if your experiencing pain. WORST dental practice EVER!!! Never go in and visit them. RUN if you can from this practice
