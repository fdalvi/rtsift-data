5 I have had multiple procedure done with Dr Higgins- he is always so friendly and really listens to what I am asking for. Their offices are gorgeous and relaxing!  I went in recently to get a Fraxel laser treatment done on my face to get rid of some redness and broken capillaries. Worked wonders and my skin looks fantastic. I usually come in every few months to touch up on botox - love it.. looks like me only better!!! They also have a great skin care line of their own- I have tried the exfolient and the night cream ( both which I really loved!) Highly recommend
5 Dr. Tam is the best dermatologist around, hands down. The office itself is beautiful and very upscale.
1 You're obviously spending a lot of money if you're coming here or interested I'm coming here so the customer service should be AMAZING, right? Apparently not here. I was referred by a friend so I called to schedule a consult. The person who answered at 7:45 said the office doesn't open until 8 so I can't schedule until then. Called back at 8:55 and the same person said all staff was in a meeting until 9 and to call back. Bad timing on my part sure.. but he was very short the first time I called and you could tell he was very annoyed the second time I called.  I won't be calling back and looking for other doctors.
