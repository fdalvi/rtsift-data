5 This place is awesome! I've been looking for a new place and I finally found it. The service is great, and the place is super clean and sanitized.  The pedicure spas have liner, which other places do not.They also have a great variety of gel colors. And they are having a grand opening of 20% off
5 I am extremely critical of where I go to get my mani/pedi done.  Katie and Kenny are the absolute best nail techs and now they have their own shop and offer great grand opening discounts plus customers get points for the work they have done and then get free services in exchange for those points.  Mark does luxurious pedis.  There is a large color selection and their pedi tubs are lined with a plastic liner and new liner is put on for each customer.  Unbelievably clean and friendly.  Give them a try so you can find out for yourself what a great place this is.  Located next to WalMart on Lake Mead and Boulder.  Used to be U.S. Nails and that sign is still on building until they have their own sign put up.  All their furnishings and equipment are brand new.
5 Kenny and Katie are AMAZING. My grandma, mom and daughter have been going to them before they opened their own shop and Im so glad they did! This place is CLEAN and they use liners in the pedicure tubs for each customer as well as cleaning them! They also give you points for every dollar you spend so you can use those points in the future for free services. They always make sure we are happy! We will always keep coming back!
5 I absolutely love this place !! I was looking for a different nail shop because mine i was going to started getting sloppy ( 10 years I went there ) after a few places I came into this one and I'm super glad that I did ! I have been going there for a few months now and I am not going anywhere ! Plus they have an awesome rewards program .
