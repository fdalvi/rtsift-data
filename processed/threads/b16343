3 This place is typical Filipino market with some hot food in the back.  This establishment was cleaner and nicer compared to other Filipino markets.    The pancit bihon is excellent - the best I've had in Vegas.  I also tried pork bbq and chicken adobo and they were both good.  It's a little pricey but I will definitely be going back.
4 Prices are a little higher than usual, but not too bad. Nice to have somewhere close by to run to when I need mochiko or other random Asian things.   Their $7.99 buffet looks pretty good - decent spread including lechon. Sign says ala carte is 50% off after 6:30pm.  Boba was pricey about $5 and since someone else mentioned theirs was all powder, ill pass on that. But I want to try their prepared food in the near future.
1 horrible!!! i went in there to buy a lunch and i have to say that i've never been to a place so horrible like "kababayan" first of all, there was this guy sitting behind a little counter at the entrance that does not greet people walking in the store, then there was this guy stacking bags of rice who of course don't say a thing.i went straight to the back to check out some food that they have and was ready to order while my wife went around the store grabbing a few stuff she wanted to buy. i stood behind the register waiting for somebody to take my order for a good 5 minutes. then i started shouting at the guy inside the kitchen for some help, 10 minutes later..nothing! i yelled 'somebody here' and still nothing. i was there for 15 minutes looking..asking..shouting like a madman for nothing. i wouldn't come back here ever again. i wouldn't recommend this place to anybody!!
