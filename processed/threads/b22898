5 What happens when you wake up after a debauch' night to see clothes flung about and a pair of shoes that look like they went thru a buffalo stampede. No if, ands or buts, take them over to the best shoe shine money can buy! Located just off the main lobby sits Mr Chinh, waiting to restore your old scuffed up shoes back to life.  This is a man that truly takes pride in his craft as he cleans the leather with his own special concoction, applies two coats of polish separated by wet and dry brush techniques and then buffs them to a better than new shine.   Most shines seem to lose their luster after a month or two. His are the only ones that have lasted 7 months or more and counting. Definite true quality and value ($7.00 for boots), so if you're in town pop on by, he works Wed-Sun, 3:00-11:0 pm. and afterwards you'll be ready for another buffalo stampede, part II...
5 Heading to Vegas next week and was browsing through things to do and saw this. A few years back my buddy had his bachelor party there & I was the best man.  Gave this guy $20 and said the bachelor & I needed our shoes shined and I would grab the bachelor and be back in 15 minutes. Sure enough as promised he held our place in line and the quality & attention to detail was better than the guys in Grand Central Terminal in NYC. After a night of drinking and whatever else ends up on your shoes go to this guy.
