4 We love a children's dentist... They have a very friendly staff and they truly seem to cater to the child. They have an awesome waiting area that is huge! There are a variety of video games, tv's,board games and even magazines to entertain the children before their appointment. The bench seating is probably the most comfortable seating that I have ever seen in a waiting area. The exam room even has a very cool salt water fish tank for the kids to enjoy.   The bottom line is that my girls don't seem bothered by coming here to see Dr. Saxe and have there teeth maintained. Isn't that the most important factor of all?
5 This place is so amazing that my 5 year old wants to come back.  I could not have asked for anything more. They delivered more than expected to my son. The staff was amazing with him and made him feel so comfortable that he actually sat through an entire cleaning without being upset once. They had him put on sunglasses during the cleaning and he thought that was cool. They hygienist also told him about the sugar bugs living in his mouth and that he has to keep up brushing and flossing so the sugar bugs wont live in his mouth.  The dentist and the assistants were made to work with children and that made it all very relaxing and enjoyable for him.
5 I wanted to start off my children with good dental habits so my 1 year old and my 4 year old see Dr. Saxe. The staff know what they're doing, they're really friendly and caring. In the beginning my 4 year old was scared, he didn't know what to expect, but he's starting to feel comfortable little by little and it feels good knowing that they are on the way to the right path to a clean beautiful smile. The staff and Dr. Saxe go above and beyond to make him feel safe and comfortable. They have all sorts of games and entertainment for the children in the waiting room and they also have a parrot, my sons love looking at the parrot. I highly recommend ACD!
4 I took my 4 year old here for her first Dentist appointment. I was really nervous because I had such a horrible fear of the dentist when I was young but they were great! They were so kind and understanding and explained everything to me. My daughter was completely at ease and had a great time. She even stayed for a cleaning and was totally fine! She had fun and is actually looking forward to coming back.
1 Tried to over charge us for dental work that is not necessary! Beware of this if you go there. Nice staff but after a second opinion, our child does not need $1800 worth of dental work. It may be worth getting a second opinion.
4 I would refer friends and family. Great staff and Dr Saxe is great with kids.
5 **************************************************************************************** Update- Mr. Michael Saxe was very kind enough to contact me and apologize for the strongly worded letter that I had received and I am very thankful for that. It really shows character.  I don't like switching medical providers because I like my children to be familiarized with whoever is treating them, they've been going to the same pediatrician since the day they were born so I want the same for their dental needs. We are very loyal clients when we have excellent service.  Dr. Saxe was kind enough to take off a percentage of the balance, we're very appreciative of that. I hope that this is the first and last time I ever have a problem with their billing department or office. Their service and treatment for my children has always been exceptional other than that. **************************************************************************************** June 5, 2013 It's almost been 1 year since I started bringing my two children here and I am honestly disappointed in their billing department. I don't like receiving a letter in the mail stating that we have been "unwilling" to proceed with payment and  that they have no other choice but to seek "aggressive action".    I know that in the past I made the mistake of not updating my address with them and the bill kept getting sent to the old address but proceeded to pay immediately. I am upset because it is very unprofessional, I work in the Legal field, before threatening any of the clients with "aggressive action" we give out various warnings, call, letters, emails, you name it! Do whatever it takes to collect the balance. If that's not effective then we either turn them over to collections or take legal action before we tarnish their credit. Not once did I receive a call or letter besides the one I received today. It is not very ethical business wise.  The person I spoke to said that they are generated automatically. Why not call and verify that your clients are receiving your letters? Is that too much to ask for? Follow up with your clients. My mistake was not calling my insurance company to verify that they paid their share. I do not know if I will be returning with my children, the whole situation has really agitated me. They need to work on fixing their generator or train their billing department better. The person I spoke to was courteous enough to apologize and said they should have followed up with a call but why apologize when the damage has been done? I'll come in and pay once everything is done the proper way, not the unethical and threatening way so I'll be waiting for my invoice and hopefully you'll follow up this time.
5 I live on the opposite side of the city (45 minutes away) and have many choices of pediatric dentists closer to me.  My daughter has been a patient of A Children's Dentist for almost eight years and I would take her nowhere else.  They care about the whole child.  My daughter has a medical condition which causes implications for dental treatment which they (not I or her medical doctor) discovered.  They LISTEN to the child and the parent.  I have never left with unanswered questions.  They made room in their schedule to see me the next day at opening when I had a concern which thankfully, turned out to be nothing, and they did not charge me for the visit (which was nice, but not expected.)  They diagnosed an orthodontic problem shortly after adult teeth started erupting which would have lead to her front top and bottom teeth being ruined without prompt treatment (by an excellent orthodontist they recommended.)  The office staff, billing department, and hygiene team/assistants have always been wonderful.  There was once a minor billing error and they promptly acknowledged it and credited it.  I have never experienced anything but kindness, professionalism, and consideration by the staff.  I am very particular about who provides my family's medical and dental care, and I sincerely think A Children's Dentist is as good as it gets.  I know the dentists won't compromise on the standard of care they give and I believe they treat each patient with the same consideration they would give to their own children. We cannot recommend this practice highly enough!
5 Thanks so much for taking care of my children the drs and staff are so nice I recommend then highly !!!!
5 I have taken my daughter to Dr. Saxe twice now and I am quite pleased with my experiences thus far.  In fact this has been her only dentist since she is not even 2 yet.  The first time I went was just after my daughter turned 1, as recommended by my pediatrician.  I asked friends if they had any recommendations and was referred to A Children's Dentist.  I am glad I was given good advice too!  I called to set up my first appointment and it was quite easy.  The lady I spoke with was helpful and friendly.  When we arrived for the appointment, we were warmly greeted and promptly taken care of.  My daughter enjoyed the waiting room as well, especially the birds up front.  There is a lot of toys and games to play with and help get the kiddos relaxed and in a good mood before heading back.    We were called back within 5 minutes of the appointment time.  The nurse/dental tech (not sure what her title was), was really friendly and good with my daughter.  The nurse explained how children's dental practices are different from adult services and let me know how this appointment would go, as well as future appointments as my daughter gets older.  I appreciated the info and I think it helped my daughter get used to everything in the exam room as well before the doctor came in.   Dr. Saxe arrived shortly afterwards and was so delightful.  He explained how the exam would go and helped me get my daughter into the correct position to check her teeth.  He was very calm and relaxing and my daughter really took to him.  He did a great job.  I wish my dentist was this friendly!  So fast forward to today, and it was even easier this time around.  My daughter seemed more comfortable and relaxed.  She ran in right to the birds while I checked her in.  When we were called back, she went willingly and was happy.  Her exam went smoothly and came back as an A+ for dental health. Yeah for no cavities!  The check out process is super easy as well.  I also like how they let you make your next appointment right then and not have to worry about it for 6 months.  The office staff that I have encountered have all been nice and friendly.    I truly enjoy this dentist office.  I wish they did adult exams too!
1 I have been taking my 5 year old son here for a couple of years now. I have never been impressed with the staff or the doctors.  For being a business with the name "A Children's Dentist", I would expect them to have better bedside manners.   A couple of weeks ago, I took him in for an exam and X-rays.  My son is pretty sensitive and gets afraid easily of things he thinks is going to hurt him.  He is also VERY sensitive to pick up on people's vibes.  When the assistant was getting ready to put the X-ray apron and collar on him she didn't even try to make him not afraid of it and got very annoyed when he did.  Needless to say, he did not get X-rays that day.  That should have been the last time I took him there, but for some reason I decided to schedule his first cleaning appointment for today.  Bad, bad mama!  Again, they just seemed annoyed when my son got nervous going into the cleaning room.  He was crying pretty loudly and I understand that can make other patients there nervous, but the doctor came in and told the hygienist  "Get them in the exam room!"  Once in the exam room, he didn't even come down to my son's level or explain anything.  He stood in the doorway and in a loud annoying patronizing voice said, "If you don't get your teeth cleaned, you're not getting a toy from the toy box."  "This is your last chance."  "Ok, no toy then."  Then when I was checking out, the outtake receptionist was also being patronizing toward my son and told me how it was ok because there was just a girl in here who was screaming her head off and basically annoyed everyone in the office.  THANKS GENIUS!!!  YOU JUST WON THE A**HOLE AWARD!  Just because you put colorful paint on the walls and play Sponge Bob Squarepants videos, doesn't make you suitable for children.
5 We have been patients at A Childrens Dentist for 4 years, since my son's first birthday. Today he had to have a small procedure that required some anesthesia. I know it was not a big deal, they do this every single day, 20 times per day but they were so caring, so attentive and so aware of how strange and scary the experience was for a 5 year old. From the very first nurse he saw to Dr. Josh. I was just so IMPRESSED and grateful. It is truly a family practice and this is something special.
3 We have to travel a good distance to get there.  They have been treating our two children for a while now.  They go there for cleanings.  We only used them because one of the dentists is part of the cleft lip/palate team.  Well he was when we first bought our son home from China.  He is older now and has braces and we really don't need to go there anymore.  There are also more expensive.  We have great ones out our way and we are going to try a new dentist.  I thought that they could of commented on or advised action about a problem regarding a tooth of my daughters which lead to more complications.  It had been like that for a while.   I didn't know the Saxe brothers had everything covered in the dental industry.  We were referred to his brother for our daughter's consultation and procedure.  We would of preferred to go to our son's specialist who does the same thing.  However, that was our own fault. Overall the office is nice except for the poor birds stuck in that dreadful glass cage.  Experience with this practice has been pretty good, but no different than others.
5 Love this dentist and the staff. I work for a general dentist but needed a pediatric dentist for my 3 year old. The dentist I work for referred me here and I'm so glad she did.  Dr. Saxe is so kind and sweet with his patients and he explains everything as he goes along. They are all upfront about everything and the costs so there are no surprises. I will be recommending this office to everyone with kids!!
4 First time to Childrens Dentist, And I must say it was pleasing!! The facility was clean and  kid Approved.. The check In receptionist was very promt  and had a warm welcoming.. Also she got right to the point with signing papers and what not.. Dr. Saxe was a joy.. He knew how to interact with my 3yr old, He showed genuine intrest & concern Over all and by far  just a Grate person!!!!.. The young women at The check out counter was Also extremely friendly. She showed intrest! buuut the reason i didnt give a 5 star? Because the dentist assistant was casually rude.. She had a kind of had a bad attitude... she was quite rude about was how A Childrens Dentist do not allow parents in the room when they do major dental work.. Me being a parent of One, is really protective of my baby gal. So i had asked her a few questions about it. Example, "Is there a glass window that allows us to check in on our child while the procedure is conducted?". replies with a unfriendly attitude, " Because its just our company policy, either you can sign the waiver or Not" Excuse Me bobo??? Uh uh.. lol  Any ways she just rubed Us the wrong way. But i wont let ONE bad apple turn me away.. PLUS, Dr.Saxe made up for her incompatent manners!  We will be back in December for her next appt..
