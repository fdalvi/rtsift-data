4 Ok, I just fell in love with the Smuggle Inn!  Lots of weird stuff going on.  A dive bar in the true sense of the word.  What exactly is being smuggled? Lots of different seating environments including two different bar sections! I can't wait to check out Wine and Art night the 15th of every month. Not for the stuck-up.
3 A pretty cool dive bar, went in after we had to buzz and be let in.  I only saw 2 other customers on a Thursday around 3pm.  The bartender was a very nice lady but she seemed tired of having to be there.   She did mention that she only encountered locals and was surprised by the fact that we found our way to this spot.  Also it is not a very busy place no matter what time you go.  I wouldnt mind coming back to this spot but I also wouldnt be upset if I didnt.  On a better note my drink was good and cheap.
4 a cool little dive cheap drinks nice atmosphere and good people. you have to ring the bell outside by the door so the bartender can let you in.
