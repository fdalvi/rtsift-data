5 The staff is friendly, very helpful and knowledgeable! They have a great inventory, and are willing to order parts to have on hand just in case you may need them.  It feels like an old time Speed shop of days gone by!  Prices are comparable to those online, and cheaper than other places around!
4 I've been a customer of SoCal for a number of years now.  Just got an email reminder that 2nd Saturdays is April 14th, this weekend.   2nd Saturdays are a blast but I can't make it to many of them, but will try for this one.    They are supporting the Desert Food Bank, so bring some canned food to this worthwhile cause. The staff has always been extremely friendly and helpful and helped with solving a number of car project problems over the years.   Way to go So-Cal and I hope to be there Sat morning.
5 Good store for us car geeks... Also this isn't just for old ford hot rods... The got plenty of classic and muscle car parts.
4 This is a great shop to find the sexi Billet items for your ride. Purchased an Polished serpentine set up for my SBC and some other dress up items and billet interior parts. Great selection and knowledgable staff. A little over priced for certain things so do your do-diligence and compare prices.
