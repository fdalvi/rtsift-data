4 Not closed. Great deals on Christmas decorations!
1 -This place SHOULD be CLOSED for many reasons, but it's still OPEN for business.  -The decor and merchandise looks cheap and low quality.  -The service is CRAP! Why is there ONLY 1 cashier in K-Mart?   -Prices seem higher than T & W.  -The (other) cashier in the Garden dept put my merchandise on the dirty counter BEHIND him instead of just placing it in the plastic Kmart bag after ringing up...what a douche!  -Half of the parking lot was unpaved with pot holes and gravel...WTH? Was I in a rural area?  -Before Target & Wal-Mart, there was K-Mart (remember ICEES & blue-light specials?)...next time you want to complain about Wal-Mart, visit your local K-mart store and you'll appreciate Wal-Mart even more!
2 I put in an order through their website for store pickup. At the end of the process it said my order should be ready within 3 hours. 4 1/2 hours later, still no pick up order email. I had to call the store. The operator transferred me to the store manager John (sp?). He was very apologetic about the delay. He said he wasn't sure anyone was scheduled that night to fill orders. He located the items to fill my order. Though I appreciate him willing to do this, I should not have to wait this long or go through a manager just to get my order filled. There should be a disclaimer that orders placed after 3 pm may not get filled until the following day. Will not use this service again. Walmart's site to store shipping may take longer but at least I know I will get my order done, and done in a timely manner. Makes me wonder what would have happened if they hadn't found the items I wanted since they are on the sales floor, not in the back.
