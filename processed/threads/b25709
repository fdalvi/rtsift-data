3 Got my sourdough jack and a shake through the drivethrough- too bad they didn't give me any napkins.
1 Been here a few times, only because we live near by. In the evening this place usually has a long line. They are usually under staff here, so the wait is long. When the employees are busy and in a rush they will usually make mistakes. Management really needs to help out and make sure customer service is a number one priority! I try to avoid this location and go somewhere else.
5 This place is so good to eat at and not expensive . Their tacos are so good
3 Place has improved a lot, but of course there is not too many customers at 5:00am on Saturday. But overall, it's getting better here. Figure since I am going through my 1-star ratings, I should give this place a better review!
