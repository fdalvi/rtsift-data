5 This place is great. Great price, great service, great experience. It is a hidden gem.
5 This place is AMAZING!!  My husband and I have been coming here for years.  It's located in the Dana Park Mall next to Firehouse Subs.  Appears to be run by a husband/wife team, Paul and Joy.  It is clean and smells nice, dimly lit with wooden floors, a fish tank, and peaceful music playing.    You start out in a reclining chair where they do foot and hand reflexology.  Then, they move you to a private room to massage your back.  I go in with stress and soreness and leave feeling completely relaxed and rejuvenated!  I have only had Joy work on me and can say that she is incredible!  My husband says Paul is awesome too.  They give you a cool bottle of water when you leave and have stamp cards for a free massage after you purchase 10.  1 hour reflexology runs you $30 + tip and they offer a couples special for $55 + tip for an hour -- the only tricky thing is making sure you get there when there are 2 available appointments but you can always call ahead!  Hours are Mon-Sat 10a-9p and Sun 10a-7p.  On a side note: Dear reflexology customers, please practice some common courtesy and don't snore like a lawn mower when you're getting your massage.  Yes, it feels good but have some self control and don't ruin the feel-good vibes for those around you.  When I went tonight there was a dude who was snoring louder than a garbage truck and moaning in his sleep.  If I wasn't so relaxed, he would've gotten his tub of foot water dumped on his head.  Seriously!  :/
5 These people really know what they're doing, and offer great prices. I go there every single weekend that I'm in town.
5 We are visiting from Portland and will visit this place every time we're here from now on. Fabulous!!
5 For $30 & 1 hour of not just a foot bath & massage, they go the extra mile & massage your face, arms, shoulders, & legs...THEN- off to the massage table for a back & glut massage! Very impressed with all they do for such an affordable price! Only odd thing is the openness & the main entrance does not face Baseline Rd.
