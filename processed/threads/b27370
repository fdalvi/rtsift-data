5 I just started training at TNT a couple weeks ago and Im very impressed.  The staff is great and listens to your needs. For anyone looking to learn brazilian jiu-jitsu coach Scott is a certified Gracie jiu-jitsu black belt. The coaches and trainers go above and beyond in helping you understand proper form and technique as well as answering any questions you might have. They also allow you to go at your own pace and do not berate or belittle you if your unable to keep up with others.  A sense of family and respect for all is the main theme at the training center. Whether your looking to become a fighter,learn self defense, or just want to get into shape TNT is great place to achieve your goals.
5 Looking for a workout that's fun or a sport for your kids to learn? This is the place to be! We love TNT, great environment with skillful coaches.
3 Like the beginner's classes they offered. The instructor took the time to demonstrate the moves and help feel comfortable with the basic. Small class sized, so lots of individual attention. There morning cardio kickboxing for early risers is one of the better ones I've tried. Everyone there was friendly (both staff and clients) and overall it has been very enjoyable.
5 I've been training here for several months and I'm very impressed.  This is a phenomenal place for ALL levels.  Whether you're a fighter or, like myself, you're looking for a GREAT workout, this is the place.  I've been to multiple gyms around the valley, some great, some not so great, so I'm in a position to compare.  My 4 year old son watches kids movies in the lounge while I train which is extremely helpful.  The coaches let you go at your own pace and they are more than happy to show you the proper technique.  Without hesitation, I would recommend TNT!
