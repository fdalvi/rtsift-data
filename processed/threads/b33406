1 At first our mortgage officer was awesome and pre qualified us at 3.5 percent financing with 3 percent down. When we went into contract with a house he then told us 4.875 with 7 percent down.... We had to quickly find another lender. Luckily we found a lender who gave us 3.75 financing with 3.5 percent down. Stay away from alterra, bait and switch is their business style.
5 Company is very trustworthy and goes above and beyond for their Customers!   I would recommend my friends and Family.
