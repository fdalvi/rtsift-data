2 Enterprise suffers from the strangest notions of customer service in the world.  Let us just leave it at that.    It is a car rental, nothing more, nothing less...but the amount of time it takes to get in and out of there is staggering.  And mind you, they are not understaffed.  Quite the opposite...they are amazingly overstaffed.  My suggestion to them, AUTOMATE.  Reduce some headcount and deal in volume rather than trying to form lasting relationships with clients.  Seriously, it's just a car man...I am renting it, not buying it.
5 Easy to deal with and really friendly staff! In n'out with no hassle! Recommend them for sure!
4 The service here is great.  It takes a good 1/2 hour to 45 minutes to pick up the car so plan accordingly.  If they are really busy, it could be even longer.  They take their time to go over the car and insurance options with you, which I appreciate.  Drop off is a lot faster.  10 minutes max.   They have never been pushy or picky with me.  Super easy process and very nice cars in my experience.  I will use them again.
