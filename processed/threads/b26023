5 I went there to get a manicure and a change of polish on my toes. The manicurist called Nancy did a fantastic job. She took her time with me. The place is clean and smells good (even though one of the manicurists was doing gel nails). Right before I left, Nancy gave me her card and a warm goodbye. I will definitely be back!
5 KC always does a great job. she takes her time and makes each nail look 100% perfect. I always love my nails every time I go here!
5 Got a fresh set of white tips and spa pedicure and couldn't be happier. I finally found a place I will regularly be returning to. Nancy did a fantastic job. The place is nice and prices are good. :)
5 I have been searching for a new salon since my move in May. After trying several salons with mediocre results I tried J Nails which just happens to be right around the corner from my house.  I couldn't be more pleased with my nails.  I got white tips and they look fantastic!  Went almost three weeks before I needed a fill for my second visit. Ask for KC, she was awesome both times.
