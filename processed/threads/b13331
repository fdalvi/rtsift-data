1 Talk about lack of customer service.  I called ahead and reserved a car for $24.99 for a customer of mine to drive while we performed some work for him.  I told the customer to put it on his credit card and I would reimburse him for it.  He brought the bill in and it was for $34.99.  I called and said there must have been a mistake.  The branch manager told me that she would get back to me within 2 days.  No call back.  I called and they told me tough, no refund, and I would have to get it from the customer.  Enterprise does not follow through on their agreements, even if they are the ones screw up.  Too bad.
1 Thanks again enterprise, my wife really didn't need you to pick her up like promised...she had no problem waking in the middle of the day,  it was only 110 outside.  At least the idiot behind the counter,  gave us $10 off.  Terrible service!!!!  Will not use again
5 I don't know why there are such negative reviews. This Enterprise was actually one of the best ones I've been to. I dropped my rental car off that I picked up from another Enterprise a week and a half ago. I was in and out within 5 minutes. The gentleman who helped me was extremely nice. Easy breezy.
