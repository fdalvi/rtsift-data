5 This organization provides medical equipment free of charge to the residents of Sun City.  It is a non-profit organization run by volunteers.  They have provided a walker for my grandpa as well as a fancy chair, similar to a recliner, but completely motorized so it will tilt up and lift him from the seated position.  We recently came here to return my grandpa's walker.  The brake had come loose so we needed a new one.  A volunteer met us in the parking lot and took the broken walker and directed us to the office.  The office worker was very nice and efficient.  We were in and out in around 5 minutes and his new walker was waiting for us outside.  The volunteer then loaded it in the car for us.  They also have other things to borrow for when residents of Sun city have grandchildren visiting.  For instance, you can borrow a crib, stroller, diaper pail, etc.  Thank you for your awesome and generous service to the residents of Sun City!
