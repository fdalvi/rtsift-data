5 I absolutely love getting massages so I decided to give this place a try. Wow is all I can say. Was skeptical at 1st because of the location. Never judge a book by the cover definitely applies to this place. The staff was really cool not like the typical "give me money" attitude of other massage places.. Competitive prices also. Guys, the girls here are stunning to look at. I will be back for more relaxing ASAP! A+..
3 If your looking for Latin women then this is the spot for you. Jessica knew what was she was doing and got the knots out of my back. I'll be back again..
5 Back in Vegas for quarterly summit for company. This time all works needed to get some deep tissue and nots out from meetings all day. Came across this place along the way back to my hotel and just made myself walkin to see what's in store. Was nice young beautiful oriental girl. Very friendly and welcoming. At first I was very hesitant, but she made me feel like I was at home. Then u started my session. Wow thought it was an Asian massage place but a beautiful young blonde was to pamper me. The massage was not the best part of the session. That's all I can say. All it was a great experience. Vegas always has something in store for me.
