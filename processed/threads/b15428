5 Great customer service.  Friendly staff.  Very prompt.
1 My complaint is with the UPS service that I received when I shipped at this store.  I spoke to a business in another state and they asked me to ship a package by FEDEX.  I decided out of convenience to go to the UPS Store near my home.  The staff was very nice and they said that UPS would guarantee to deliver the package the next day.  I paid the rate because it was called NEXT DAY AIR and it was "GUARENTEED" to arrive in 24 hours.    The package was not delivered in 24 hours.  The staff was very apologetic but the result was that a package that was guaranteed to be delivered in 24 hours was delivered in 48 hours.    They quickly processed a refund, but I would rather have had the package delivered on time.  I learned my lesson. I will NEVER ship with UPS again.
4 Had a mailbox with them for a few months and I really like their service. They're always really polite on the phone too. Why not 5 stars then? Because they don't seem to be reading my emails. I sent the same email request a couple of times regarding an account info change before I decided to call in myself, and my account info was updated immediately upon calling.
4 Great customer service that was very knowledgeable in the best approach to picking up packages.  I had no clue what I was doing, but they did and it helped.
