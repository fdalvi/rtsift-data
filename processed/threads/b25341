2 Worker constantly talking on phone or with friends instead of working.  She makes you feel like you are an inconvenience to serve.  Slow service and only works on one order at a time, very inefficient.  Food is mediocre.  Feels like the kind of placed you are forced to eat at because of no other options.  There IS a much better option in building next door.  WAY better.  Better food, terrific service.
2 They can never work under heavy orders. The sandwiches are over priced with hardly any content in it.. There is no other place walkable from the bldg, I would rather prefer going to that place.
