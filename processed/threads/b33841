5 Quick and wonderful service!  They did a really good job on my daughter's dress and she is in love with it!  They also have the best prices I've seen in a 25 mile radius.  I would definitely recommend to others.
5 Amazing!  That is the only way to describe this place.  The owner works fast and is extremely friendly and on the off chance that you don't like it or it is not quite right she will bend over backwards to fix it.  I have had a dress shortened/hemmed, a lined dress taken in all over, a skirt taken in at the waist and a zipper shortened in a dress.  Her prices are great and she will get it done in a hurry for you with no up charge.  She is so friendly I am happy I found such a great talior in Madison no one has come even close.  They are tucked into that little strip mall right next to Joann Fabrics.  LOVE THEM!
5 I love this place. May is great and very fast, she always suggests a finish date that is way before I planned on it being done. I recently got a bridesmaids dress altered there (taken in on both side, no zipper) for under $40 and paid $5 for a few discreet button on some very low cut dresses. The prices are good and she's open after 5, which is super nice. May is really friendly and I'm glad to have found her.
1 Had been there before previous work was excellent, I took several items when I returned home I found a big hole in the back of my dress immediately brought it back and they refused to take responsibility for it. Very disappointed, lying is unacceptable. If your going to have a business take responsibility for your actions I would have forgiven the mistake if an offer had even been made to repair it . Terrible customer service.
5 May is very detailed and helpful. A wonderful person to work with. May helped me fix my Bridal gown after another seamstress from Vera's ruined it. The best part is that she had a one week turnaround for some complex work! I am taking all of my alterations to May in the future!
