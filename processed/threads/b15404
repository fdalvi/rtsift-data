4 Great quality grocery store. Always clean. Always stocked. Been going there for the past 15 years.
3 fast pharmacy.
5 This is my favortie Fry's store to shop in.  The employees here are very friendly and will actually look at you, greet you, and smile.  Lance has always been very helpful whenever I am looking for something in the store.  One of the cashiers I believe his name is Angel? is always very nice and helpful.
1 No more going to this frys ever again. I live so close I can throw a rock and hit them, but I will now go out of my way to not go there ever again. It smells awful. So awful I turned around to leave as soon as I walked in. It is a gross pee sort of sewer smell that has permeated the whole place. No thanks, I'll go to another from now on. Ew!!
4 I refuse to go to Safeway anymore because they have the worst customer service. This store is right across the street so we gave it a try and were pleasantly surprised with how nice the store was laid out and how friendly the staff seemed to be.  New go-to store from now on!
