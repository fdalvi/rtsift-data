1 the folks in student financial aid  are the reason I don't attend this school they are clueless, dishonest and dare I say hateful.   If you have tons of money and need no advice then go here.   If you ever .......... ever need help with paying for school then lol do as I was told "scale back your lifestyle"   even the advisors know how horrible they are, yet no one does a thing......  before leaving I went on Facebook to get info from other students about fin aid... guess what they deleted it.   LOL ummmmm ok
4 I have also attended SCC in Scottsdale, and I really prefer this campus. The course offerings are endless, the faculty is helpful and approachable, and the campus is being renovated for the better! The library is large, with plenty of tables inside, outside, and another computer lab right across the hall. Free wifi for students, too.  I've only had a couple of instructors that I didn't care for, but I will say, everyone speaks English perfectly! I have mostly really enjoyed my classes, and when I found myself getting bored, I picked a different major. I think that's what a lot of people do, and they should. The world doesn't need another next generation who hates what they do. So explore here, and find out what you do like. They have a great transfer program also. I am looking forward to attending ASU downtown in the future. I only go part time to school, so when I started, ASU downtown wasn't an option yet. Who knows what other great choices there are to come? I especially love the Fitness Center! Get college credit to work out? Yeah!!
2 Not the quality education I was looking for. The professors are disorganized and can NOT teach, especially lab. In particular, CHM 151LL and 152 LL Dr. Indu Mishra will take off points for no reason even for a perfect lab report. Inconsistency in grading, students with less accurate data end up with higher grades on the lab reports. Run the other way while you can.
