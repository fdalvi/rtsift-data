5 Just started taking Martha's classes.  I audited level 1 and level 3 and so far I am impressed.  This is the fast track to learning Spanish.  She is direct and knows exactly how to cut to the chase so you can get on with understanding and speaking.  She cuts out a lot of the grammatical crapola that turns most people off and that makes it hard to learn. I will update this somewhere in the middle of the course and at the end of the course.
5 I am in my third year of classes at Language Synergy.  Martha provides excellent instruction in a very enjoyable manner, tailored to the students' level and needs.  The materials used are excellent and very effective.  I have also traveled with Martha and other students to Costa Rica last year and Madrid this year.  I can honestly say that in the short time I have been taking classes, I definitely learned enough to communicate with the people I met and to enjoy my time in Spanish speaking countries, one of my primary goals.  Martha offers classes, private and semi-private lessons at a  variety of levels and times.  I highly recommend Language Synergy to anyone with the desire to learn Spanish.
5 This is NOT your High School Spanish Class!  Martha's classes make learning Spanish fun and exciting.  I have enjoyed taking her class so much that I look forward to when my son is school age and can take classes with her as well.
