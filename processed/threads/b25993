5 I have been to Stacey for a Raindrop Technique and Life Coaching. Both have been not only phenomenal in the short term, but were extremely beneficial over the long term.   The physical health benefits of the Raindrop Technique (massage, body/mind work, & therapeutic essential oils) were enhanced by life coach counseling. She gave me tools to use. Giving others the tools to take responsibility for enhancing their own health is a fantastic gift.  With my mind/body/soul balanced, I have started this year off into an amazing journey.  Thank you Stacey!

5 When I started working with Stacey my goal was to be able to totally support my family financially, and be free to travel when we wanted.  Less than three years later we are financially set, and able to travel at will.  All the goals I worked on with Stacey I achieved, although not in the ways I originally planned. I reccommend her to everyone.
