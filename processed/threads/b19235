5 Best pizza for the price in town!!! Very fast delivery as well. My roommates and I get the Godzilla deal all the time!
4 Amazingly cheap pizzas. Great selection of toppings (especially things like spinach and broccoli and feta that other places consider "gourmet" for the price of regular toppings). $7.90 for a one-topping extra large? Delicious!  However they should have a better phone answering service during dinner hours since they put me on hold for 12 minutes once before getting to my order.
5 Best pizza in Waterloo. I only order from here. Cheap and fast delivery. The guys are really friendly too.  The pizza is crispy but not too crispy. The pepperoni is the best.  My friends from out of town always ask to order from here and won't want to eat anywhere else.
2 Hot. Delivered promptly. Low price. Poor to average deliciousness. Look elsewhere if taste is your top priority.
3 Average pizza. They have really good deals for when you order 3 pizzas, so its ideal to order in big groups.
3 I found their delivery to be very fast. Under 25 minutes in my case. Their pizza is decent, nothing special. They included a free dipping sauce with the pizza too, which was a nice bonus.
4 I have been going here for years now whenever I'm craving some pizza. Great pizza, good deals, and good customer service. Can't ask for much more.
