5 This place is on the upper end of pricing when it comes to dry cleaners. But believe me, you get what you pay for! I have had great experiences with them and appreciate their friendly, fast service. Last week, I made the mistake of going to another place and now I'm going back to Polo Cleaners to have them take care of what the other place didn't! Don't make the mistake I did, save the time and money and go to Polo Cleaners the first time! Thanks!
3 This is no French laundry but they do a decent job. Very timely and the price is good.
1 Price on laundering shirts went from $2.60 each (for one day service they already charge more - drop off in morning and pick up in evening next day) to almost $5 each!  Why? After coming here for weeks, they've suddenly decided they've been charging me wrong to launder the size 4x shirts. Bigger shirts equal more money.  Other cleaners in the area don't charge twice as much for a larger shirt.
5 Wonderful service. I took 3 pairs of pants in there to have them hemmed. One pair was a high end brand that cost me $112 just for the one pair of slacks. They did an excellent job. Yes, it cost a little more, but it gets done right and it was done when she said it would be. Thank you for having a business that still offers great customer service and has integrity to do a great job. Money well earned. Thank you
