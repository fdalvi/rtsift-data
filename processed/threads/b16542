2 If you are desperate and have no where else to turn. This come close to Chinese food. I suggest going 2 China One in the Smith shipping center. Way better food for similar prices. Actually I am holding back a bit. Call me a snob but Panda is horrible.
2 I go here because it is convenient and I leave here thinking I should have went somewhere else. My walnut shrimp tasted like they had been "re-cooked" and fell apart. My beef tasted like it had been sitting in the pan for a very very long time. The cream cheese wontons were very old and dry.  The only highlight was the kung pao chicken. Lots of chicken and squash. It was delicious. I wish I would have gotten more of it instead of the above.   I always get the 1/2 1/2 with the fried rice and chow mein. It was ok.  Service was fast. But, I don't want to return here and will resist the urge for a long time.
3 Who doesn't know about Panda Express?  I have to admit: I first patronized this place because of the cute panda mascot.  Now, I find myself searching for PE when I want a quick Asian-style hit.  It is what it is and sometimes the food could be fresher.  BUT, if you know what you're getting and not expecting 5* authentic Chinese cuisine, then you'll probably be happy.
2 The food is wonderful but the staff is a disappointment!! They forgot to give me my mandarin sauce on the side and I called and they just hung up on me.
5 Good place
3 I go here nearly weakly to eat. Amazing food. Only complaints I have is that the orange chicken doesnt have much of a kick to it like the orange chicken at other panda express's. Also if you go in half an hour before closing they wont bother to keep making food. They say whatevers there is what you can get. Period.
