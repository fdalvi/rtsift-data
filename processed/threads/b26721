5 Suzanne is great with my cat which she does by special appointment only. My chow is groomed by her on a regular basis and at a very reasonable rate too. She takes good care of my fur kids.
5 I winter in Las Vegas and this is a great groom shop that someone told me about years ago and I've been coming here ever since. They take great care of my Muffin and her cut always looks awesome! I've even recommended them to many other people who now come here. I only wish they were closer to Green Valley Ranch, but it's worth the drive. Be sure to call ahead, their appointments fill up fast.
5 Best Groomer in the city....my dog is a big old baby, but I never worry when Suzanne and her staff are working with him....he always gets a great haircut and is so happy, I know that he is treated with kindness each time I bring him in...I drive all the way from the north, and it is worth it! Very reasonable rates too....
1 NO STAR!      I would NEVER take my two Chihuahuas there again and YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE YOUR PETS THERE EITHER. The two women were so busy gossiping that they clipped one dogs nails too short  so that the quick's bled. They didn't care about the stress they were causing to my dog by continuing to attempt to aggressively clean the drying blood from her paw, I had to interject  "Give here to me now! STOP rubbing her paw she is clearly stressed out!"  The response from the salon owner was, we didn't do that on purpose, so defensive, so unprofessional, it is all about them and not your pet beware!
