5 I am a real estate agent here in Las Vegas and I refer all of my clients and friends to "A Friendly Drain Cleaner". They do not just clean drians, they offer all plumbing services at a resonable rate. They are responsive and always on time. I highly recommend them!
5 I had a huge leak that resided between my house and the water main. These two gentlemen were exactly that. Gentlemen. I believe they were fair and their work was perfect. They used the best quality materials, speedy work, and even saved me a lot of money compared to the other two estimates that I got. Very happy with the experience and will defiantly recommend to family and friends.
5 Great service.  Very knowledgable and expedient.  I highly recommend them!
5 Wonderful!  Next time one of the kids flushes a toy down the toilet, we are definitely going to call Elemental Plumbing!  The guys were not only efficient, but they told a few great stories!  I strongly recommend them!
5 I had called Elemental plumbing to come investigate a problem I had with my bathroom plumbing. They arrived within half an hour of my call and immediately began working on the problem. They were nice enough to explain the problem to me in detail and did not charge me an arm and a leg. They were very honest people that I would highly recommend. Thank you once again Elemental plumbing.
5 Honest. Prompt. Decently priced. This was the second plumber service. First guy thought he fixed clogged toilet, charged us, and quickly took off. We called back to say it wasn't fully fixed, but he never returned. Used yelp to find this plumber. Worked out Perfectly. Thank you.
