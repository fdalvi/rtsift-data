4 It has been a LONG TIME since I've enjoyed a DQ treat! I ordered a Heath bar Blizzard in size small. It was delicious! Took me back 13 years when I use to frequent a nearby DQ in Texas.  Customer service at this corner suite at the mall was nice. It wasn't busy and the 2 workers were attentive and patient with the 4 of us (me, my 2 girls, and one of their friends).  The place was clean and the worker was helpful in directing us to the nearest bathroom (about 20 steps away).  Only surprise: the size small was too much! All of us struggled to finish passed half way. We should have ordered the mini. Now we know why it's on the menu.   I paid $3.80 each. Sounds pricey until you start eating it. We definitely feel like we got our money's worth. Plus, the size small, when they fill it, towers over the top about 1-2 inches!  I can't promise I'll frequent this place (I mean, I DO have a waistline to consider), but I definitely recommend it.  One more piece of advice, eat it outside. We about froze our tails off until we got smart and sat outside. DQ Blizzard + 103 degrees = "It's nice outside. Let's hang out!"
5 I like to get the strawberry julius here about twice month - it has been consistently good every time.  When they are busy the line still moves quickly.
1 5pm on a Monday, 2 young girls working with zero smiling, zero eye contact, not kind at all. Very slow moving, acting like they hate life! Ordered a large pina colada regular and it has zero flavor. So the whole trip was a waste.
