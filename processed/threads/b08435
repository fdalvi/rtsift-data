4 Their hours are not the most convenient, and they don't pay for glass, but they're the most convenient place on the east side and their staff is friendly.  You can also drop off lots of stuff that they won't pay for, but at least you're recycling.  They pay for cans and plastic bottles (and maybe some other things, but that's all I ever bring).
5 For many years I have processed my paper, cardboard and aluminum recyclables through low-budget, off the beating path, dirty and unfriendly businesses, this was until I discovered United Fibers in Chandler.   I never imagined a company in this industry could be so professional, clean and customer focused than these guys.    They're very competitive in paying top dollar for my recyclables. I also discovered they now recycle and pay for clothing, which is odd. Reviewing the company's website it's my understanding they recycle paper, cardboard and clothing to make insulation... all transformed under one roof. How refreshing to see my old newspapers converted into a sustainable eco-friendly.   The bonus...  Each time I visit there's always a departing gift of a complimentary bottle of ice-cold water, a welcomed gesture of appreciation on extreme triple-digit days.
3 it's quick and easy, they open at 7:30a until 3p Monday through Friday. They accept cardboard, plastic, aluminum,and paper but not glass. It's painless, just drive up to where the bins are, and whoever is manning the dump, assists with your stuff from your car then they weigh and give you a paper with the weight, afterwards you drive up to their exit, where a lady translates the weight to what you'll get money wise. Bring your recyclables on the last Wed. of the month to get double the price on your goods.
