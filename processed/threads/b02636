5 Great help and awesome staff! They definitely put service and professionalism first!
5 Very helpful staff and great selection on lenswear.  This is a family owned business and they care about their patients. Dr. Lee is friendly and professional. Unlike most doctors that don't really take their time to answer all your questions, Dr. Lee is thorough and attentive to all your questions and concerns.
5 Dr. Lee is very friendly and knowledgeable.  Service was great and quick!
5 I just relocated here from Chicago & saw them while driving around. I had a recent exam and new frames, I just needed it filled. I walked in without an appointment & inquired about my insurance & what I needed & walked out less than 15 minutes later with everything taken care of. My glasses arrived in a timely manner & are great. Very nice staff!
5 I had a great experience as they took me in for my eye care.  Scheduled an Appointment within a week, and gave me the needed care, info, and contacts that were needed.  No Complaints here.
1 My wife verified with them several times to make sure they took our insurance (aetna is not a fly-by-night company) before making an appointment for me. When we got there they said "yes, we do take Aetna, just not your plan". Very unprofessional, they should have verified the plan before wasting our time.
3 I have gone here for about 3 years the last two visits have been horrible. They run about an hour late they have one dr on duty and schedule 3 appointments for the same time.  The receptionist acts like shes there fir a paycheck doesnt care about anyone.  There service was always good until these last 2 visits. If you like waiting hope you have a good book because you will be waiting for atleast an hour
