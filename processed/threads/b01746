5 I have been a patient of Dr David J Anderson for years!  I keep going back to him for my eye care needs because I know he provides exceptional service!  He is the best.  Very caring.  Concerned about eye issues/needs.  He takes interest in me as not only a patient but a human being and individual.  He sincerely cares and certainly makes me feel comfortable in his office.  Extremely nice guy and very professional!  If I could rate him with more stars, I would give him more than a gazillion stars but Yelp will only allow me to give Dr Anderson 5 stars!  After all, Dr Anderson is a STAR DOCTOR when it comes to my optical needs!
5 I've been going to Dr. Anderson for a few years.  Great guy, great service.
5 By far, Dr David Anderson sets the example of true, genuine, compassionate healthcare/eye care.  I have been going to Dr Anderson since 1995 or 1996 and I do so because of how he treats me as not only a patient but as if I am his brother or best friend.  On March 20, 2014 I had the opportunity to introduce Dr Anderson to a friend of mine who was long overdue for an Eye Exam and new Contact Lens.  With this, Dr Anderson went much above and beyond and even the extra mile to help this friend.  Dr Anderson has certainly won another lifetime patient.  Thank You Dr Anderson.  You have a beautiful new office and I will continue to send people I know to your office.  You are THE BEST!!! - gary hundley
5 Arcadia Eye Care should be anyone's first stop for optical services. The Staff was exceptional and I had a very good experience. DR Anderson is thorough and caring....And kudos goes to Michael and Frank....Michael made the testing experience low stress and interesting...Frank served as the fashion consultant for choosing frames that will compliment face shape and skin coloring...I could see a spark of passion for what this business is all about.
