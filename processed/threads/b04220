4 So far I like this store just fine. The customer service is friendly. And it appears to be a full-service store. You can mail your stuff, rent a mailbox, shop for office supplies, make copies, order specialty print jobs, fax, notary, etc.  The place was relatively busy but there were two friendly staff working so the wait wasn't so long.  When I come across good customer service, I come back. I'll be back...
4 The people at this location, a former "Mail Boxes, Etc." business are very friendly and go out of their way to provide exceptional service.  Recently, my wife ordered two new commodes for our house from a plumbing supplier and had them shipped by truck to our home location. Somehow, the shipper used our credit card billing address for the ship to address in error. Our mail gets delivered at this UPS Store location... The staff at The UPS Store accepting this shipment of two very large crates from a common carrier trucking company, called us up and then when we got there loaded the crates into the pickup truck we borrowed.  And these crates were VERY HEAVY! Kudos to the UPS Store for being exceptionally focused on their customers! We have used ths location for 6 years..
3 I shipped a bunch of Albuterol my aunt gave me. This is illegal. The UPS store handled it for me though. And for under 20 bucks. There was a lot of Albuterol. Like too much for me to ever use. But again, UPS handled it for me. Now my lungs will be as open as sunroofs...unless it's cold or raining. Then that metaphor doesn't really work.
