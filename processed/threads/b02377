5 This store is wonderful.  They have a website: www.milksmile.com  Chuck owns the store and works at the counter; a little odd to see at first but he's so friendly and knowledgeable about breastfeeding and pumping.  They also have a lactation consultant available (Mary) for $35 and she is wonderful.  They have a nice assortment of products available and you can weigh your baby for free.
5 Chuck has put together an incredible service through his store.  He offers a plethora of breastfeeding necessities, accessories and clothing.  He also has a lot of wonderful gifts and fun baby items.  He has two staff lactation consultants who are absolutely wonderful.  One of them teaches his FREE breastfeeding class which would be a steal at the $60 other places charge!  Chuck himself is amazingly knowledgeable about breastfeeding and most things baby.
4 This store came highly recommended to me when I needed to find a good bra that would last through pregnancy and nursing.  When I asked on my mother's email group, I was a little shocked that so many people recommended Chuck - A MAN - as the "go to" person.  I made the drive from Central Phoenix to check it out for myself and they were totally right.  Chuck is friendly and knowledgeable and the bra he recommended was perfect.  I live quite a distance from the store but made another trip out there to buy MORE of those bras because I liked them so much.   I love that it is locally owned and operated.  A great resource!
5 Sadly, it is no longer in business.  It was a great resource for nursing mothers.  :(
