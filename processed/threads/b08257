5 my new favorite place!!!!
5 It is my new favorite place to go.
5 I got a mani and a pedi, and it was done the with critical attention to detail. There was also a gratuitous feeling when I left the place. A feeling that will make you want to comeback.  Appointments recommended.
4 I have been coming to this nail salon for 4 years and am very happy with everything they do. Kevin is very fast and thorough with my nails and I've never had a better pedi anywhere than I get with Vinny.
5 Always the best quality service. I recommend the gel polish. I love all the techs that work there.
