2 Awful awful customer service. Aside from not being able to hear your order they constantly repeat back the wrong order. When asked a simple question they pause as if your speaking a foreign language then ask you to repeat it. This situation happen to me twice in one day and 1x today.
4 Just went to the drive thru. It was painless fast and very accurate. So I give them four stars. The lady who helped me was sweet and very professional.  I will stop in often to eat inside and wow my food is so hot and yummy!
1 I order onion rings with my food. There was a hair on the, a long hair about 4-5 inches. It was no big, I went to the counter to have them switched out, I showed them to the cashier who obviously didn't take notice. She grabbed the tray with the onion rings on them and common sence; the hair will fly off while your move the try across the front counter area. When I told the manager Lucia , I wasn't rude at all, I just wanted the onion rings repced because Cleary saw the hair. She said in Spanish no one here has long hair. I'm bilingual, she didn't know that. The ladies there have long hair. She was rude and defensive so I gave up and just said I'd like my money back. She of course kept her attitude the whole time. Burger king needs to retrain this manager Lucia to have customer service skills not just pushing paper and flipping burgers.
