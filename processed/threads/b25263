4 Friendly, fast and very yummy! They make their bagels from scratch and they are very good.  Its a great place to stop in and grab a fast breakfast.  The nova lox bagel and breakfast bagel with egg and ham are our favs!!
4 This place is really good for a quick breakfast. They have breakfast specials where its 4.65 for a warm bagel sandwich and a medium coffee. I've been here about 3 times now and think it is very good.  Tried the sausage/egg/cheese bagel sandwich twice and a egg/lox/onion one once. Sausage/egg/cheese one is good. The salmon one was not bad either. You do have to pay extra for that one however. They make the bagel sandwich in about 5-6 mins so you know its not all pre-made. Coffee is decent, not the best but will suffice in the morning for 90% of people. Will definitely go back.
4 Only been here once but the Italian Hero on a garlic bagel was very good...  they price was perfect for the quality and quantity.  I will go back.
4 Good bagels here for sure. Protein packed sandwiches make for a good meal between my workouts. Good prices as well. I haven't tried the pizza here yet but I will be back to see how it is.
5 I am lucky to work a walk away from this place.  The name does not tell it all.  They have great bagels (have not tried coffee there) for sure.  They also make what I think is the best New York style pizza I've ever had.  Order a pie to go, and you'll know what I mean!
5 Very reasonably priced, friendly and fast. And the closest tasting to a "New York bagel" that I've found in Arizona. Glad I live so close!
