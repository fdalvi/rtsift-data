5 Servers are friendly here and the fries are always fresh and crisp.  The best thing about this MCD's is Mimi, their 88 year old worker. She always remembers me and others and gives us a grandmotherly hug. I wish I had her spunk and energy. A hard worker and such a sweetheart!   5 stars to Mimi!
3 I haven't eaten food from McDonald's in years, but I've stopped by this Mickey D's location several times recently for their ice cream cones...   $1.64 for two ice cream cones... you can't beat that!  And they are reduced-fat too!  For those that want something fancier, they also offer McFlurries (the McDonalds version of DQ Blizzards) with toppings such as oreo cookies, M&M's and Rolos, and sundaes with hot fudge, hot caramel, and strawberry.    As their slogan goes, "I'm lovin' it!"
2 don't get me wrong mcDonalds is good but at specific locations it varies this is one of them i ordered drive thru for me and my lil one and well we got food poisoning next day we at first said cant be McDonalds but that was one of the last things we ate the prior day i hate to type this but watch out for sure
4 20 McNuggets for under $5. When I crave a McDonald's cheeseburger, only a McDonald's cheeseburger will do. A life long staple.
3 This particular McDonald's is actually decent. The cashiers sometimes have a hard time understanding English but usually get my order correct. And I usually only wait an average of seven minutes for my order to be ready.
4 I always drive thru. Usually I get an ice cream of some sort. The ice cream is great.  I can't say much for the food but the breakfast can be great. I like their cafe drinks.   All in all I'm happy with this location.
