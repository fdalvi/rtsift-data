5 Dr. Thresher and his staff are fantastic - if you are looking for a great orthodontist near summerlin, he is the one.  My daughter has had braces for 2 years and each appointment is smooth and accommodating.
5 Not only is Dr. Thresher great with children but as an adult I've been extremely satisfied!! I had some issues with my retainer but his staff went above and beyond to accommodate me to fix it since I live out of state. The office is very clean, modern and inviting...love the movies they play just wish the screens were on the ceiling :)) I would highly recommend Dr. Thresher...first class!!
5 I used his free consultation to receive a second opinion for orthodontic work that I had done by a different doctor. I kind of expected it to be like a sales pitch, however not only he spent lots of his time to examine my braces, teeth, and my jaw, instead he did not even suggest me that I leave my current doctor and he even offered to talk to my current doctor to guide him what to do with my braces.  He answered all my questions and he genuinely cared about my situation. I wish I did my research and got braces from him.   His office is very clean and inviting and all the staff are very friendly, too.  I highly recommend him!!! I really wish I could have my braces done by him....
