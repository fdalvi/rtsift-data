4 After multiple visits to this location, I can say that they are above average in their customer service. Staff turnover seems to be high, but I guess most fast food places have the same problem. Never had a problem with food quality or noticed any cleanliness issues when dining inside. Drive thru usually moves quickly.
3 Quick service, fresh food, just wish that they had the A&W back. The A&W on tap and cheese curds here were fantastic. Oh well, whats done is done.
3 As far as fast food chicken places, it's ok, nothing spectacular.  I wasn't impressed with the chicken sandwich I got, in fact I don't remember the name of it.  It would have been better had it been a chicken patty instead of a strip and if they had actually done more than shown the bun the special sauce.   The best part, are the reusable containers the coleslaw comes in.
