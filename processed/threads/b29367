4 Nice store to the Historic Catlin Court in Glendale.  It appears there are new owners, or at least a new partner.  The shop looks to be in the beginning stages of getting up and running, but of the little inventory they have, there are some really cute things.    I bought a really cute dress for a toddler, and there were many more items I wanted to purchase.  This store features crafts created by local artisans, such as quilts, children's clothing and toys, jewelry, women's clothing and a few antique finds.  Can't wait until this store is full to the brim, I look forward to shopping here again.
5 This Children's boutique is fantastic!! They feature many handmade items for infants and toddlers. Blankets, applique onsies, crocheted hats, flower headbands, scarfs, tutus etc...   I stopped by during Glendale Glitters and was very excited by their selection. Chatted a bit with one of the owners. She told me that several ladies contribute to the contents of the store and that they are trying to keep things local by opening the shop.  They will also do custom orders!  I bought a few crocheted beanies (for $5 bucks a piece!!!) a few flowers for some headbands I had. We also bought some mittens and a handmade bear eared beanie.   The prices are great! Better than buying online similar items. I would recommend this store to moms looking for one of kind items for their little ones or someone trying to purchase a great baby shower gift.   I look forward to purchasing more items from them.
5 Love this shop. They custom made my daughters first birthday outfit.owner is very sweet as well. Anyone with kiddos needs to check it out!!
