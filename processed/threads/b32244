5 New ownership has really made this dealership shine. Ask for Big O if you are interested in a new vehicle without the song and dance of other dealerships. He put NO pressure on us to make a decision.  For Service I trust Chris P. You can count on integrity and competence with him.
5 I don't hand out 5 stars very often. You have to be exceptional to get that from me. In this case it was a no brainer.  Had my 2013 Dodge Ram 1500 truck for almost 6 months now. I love this truck.  But aside from that I wanted to send a shout out to Superstition Springs Chrysler Jeep Dodge and Steve. Steve was my salesman and was one of the best I've ever worked with. That is saying a lot as salesmen tend to be a bit shady in my opinion. I have bought a few cars in my time.   Steve made the whole process so smooth. The team at Superstition Springs Chrysler Jeep Dodge was very professional. I actually forgot I was at a car dealership. There was no pressure at all.   Since then I have referred several people to Steve who bought cars. How can you lose with a dealership that puts it's customers first.   Do a little research before you go in so you know more about the car than they do. Especially price. As with any car dealership, know the price or you will pay too much.  Best of Luck!
