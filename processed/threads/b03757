1 Our HOA property management group.  Pretty awesome at doing nothing.  Rarely enforces the bylaws.  I honestly don't even think they patrol our neighborhood for violations.  However, they're not bad at collecting HOA fees.  I would recommend a property management company that manages more than their own finances.
1 I cannot state strongly enough how disappointing the management services are at Amcor. The particular community manager I have dealt with over the past year is both unfriendly & unprofessional. His lack of attention to community concerns will leave your HOA vulnerable to insurance claims or law suits.
1 I have been attempting to contact my property manager for almost a week now to no avail. My car was supposed to be towed within 24 to 48 hour for expired tags, which is understandable. However, I fixed the issue and tried to communicate that to them. Its been a week to the day, and they just towed my up to date car for no reason.  This is absolutely unacceptable! Definitely not professionals at all. Please save yourself the headache and look else where.
