1 Poorly laid out course with landscaping that is unkept. Disrespectful management. Overall bad experience. Don't make the mistake of going here
3 This is a decent place to play golf for really cheap.  You get what you pay for.  Don't come here expecting a super nice high end golf course, but if you are looking for an inexpensive place to play golf or get some practice, this might be the place for you.  $7 for a big bucket of balls to take to the driving range.  $9 for a round of golf (9 holes) before noon or $12 after noon
