5 If you need technology support--calll Plexus--Cory Gould.  He is very talented, and works on-site.  he is dedicated to problem solving and diagnosing your problem and is very reasonably priced.  As a consultant, it is such a relief to have someone locally who can troubleshoot technical issues that are beyond my capacity or the guessing process that Dells go through.
5 We had a client whose computers failed on-site. We're half way across the country during Thanksgiving with no way to fly out in time to get the computers fixed. I called several places, not a single one picked up, until I reached Cory. Cory was absolutely great to work with and had the PCs up and running in no time at all.   Great customer service, fast turnaround time, very knowledgeable and rates were competitive. Can't go wrong with Plexus!
1 Very disappointed in thier lack of customer service.  I called and left a message, a week later I am STILL waiting for a returned call.
5 Plexus was great!  They fixed the wireless network in our rental home and now it works perfectly!  Look at me, just posting away on Yelp and you would never know I had been suffering from internet woes!  We went from only getting a wifi signal in one end of the house to getting a strong signal everywhere.    Cory was polite, knowledgeable, punctual, and professional.  It was easy to get an appointment the day after I called, and he accommodated our schedule to come troubleshoot our issues at a time convenient for US!  After he had logged a good deal of time troubleshooting out network issues the first day, he came back the second day, brought us the new router we needed (didn't make us go out and get it and call him once it was in), AND he didn't charge us for his time the second day, just the equipment.     Highly recommend Plexus - genius bar's got nothing on these guys.
