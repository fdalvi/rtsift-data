2 Dining room is a little dingy for a chain. Ripped seat cushions and a messy condiment bar. Drive through does not get orders exact ( e.g. Ask to hold the cheese ensures a hamburger with cheese).
3 This location used to be an absolute hole.  They recently renovated both the interior and the exterior, and now it's a very pleasant, good-looking store.  However, it's still Wendy's food.  And that's only okay.
