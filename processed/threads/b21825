4 The women working here are awesome. I needed my wedding dress shortened and taken in a bit. There was beading along the bottom and around the bust, and she did an amazing job! I could not have been more pleased. She was able to tailor my dress in less than a week (I had to travel on a plane with it, so I was petrafied it would not be completed in time. But it was!) Would highly recommend for any types of alterations.
5 Love, Love, Love, Love awesome place to go my wedding dress came out beautiful made my curves show was nice to have it fit lost 50 lb so I felt pretty. She took care of   me I'd recommend that place to everyone!
3 Kind of overpriced. Made my ugly suit coat slightly less ugly (my fault), but I will likely not be back.
