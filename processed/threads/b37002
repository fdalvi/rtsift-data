5 I had no idea how I was going to get this hot tub out of my yard, so I called The Pick Up Artist and in a very short two hours presto it was gone. They were fast and professional. The price I was quoted never changed. I will recommend them every time!!
5 Great service at a great price. Made quick work of a hot tub, large swing set, and gazebo.
5 Dennis and his colleague arrived early for their appointment on a Sunday morning. The Pick-up Artist offers convenience and great service in a very courteous and efficient manner. Thank you!
5 i contacted Dan a couple days ago and emailed him at (dgjr95@gmail.com) the pictures on what to pick up. i got the quote in less than 7 mintues and was offer a deal.   i decided to pre-pay for the work (scheduled in advance) which comes to $220. a day later, to my surprise, my new tenant had someone took care of it and i dont' need his service any more. I requested $200.00 refund instead of $220. paid, because of his lost time and credit card debit charge.   I told him just "$200" is fine and I am happy. Instead he refunded entire FULL AMOUNT of $220.00  All i can say is he is a good honest local citizen of Las Vegas...operating with high integrity and providing a service you can call on...next time when in need...  He is the "Pick Up Artist - the Junk and not the Girl".  Sincerely,   Felix Liu, Trustee F Liu, Trustee & Co. (a real estate hedge fund manager)
5 Dennis is the man. Got a quote. Dennis came out the next day on time. Fast, efficient, friendly, and good price. I highly recommend these guys!!!
