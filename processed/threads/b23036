4 Located in a corner of a convenience store/gas station on East Wash this place has ZERO ambiance, but the gyros.....   Yum!  Dare I say "the Best in Madison".  Gyro house is part of the Capitol Petro station that recently re-opened on East Wash (accross from the most abysmal Burger King in the world).  Don't let the fact that it is in a gas station scare you off though -- the gyros here are big and delicious.  Get the food to go and find a picnic spot somewhere where you can slip off into Gyro-induced euphoria.  Really good stuff!
5 During all my time in Madison I had never had a gyro that really wowed my taste buds, that was until I found the Gyro House. While their gas station attachment may make you think there isn't anything special here, think again! Their gyros are unbeatable with delicious pita bread, succulent lamb meat, and a light and tasty cucumber yogurt sauce. On top of that they have excellent french fries that are always hot and straight out of the fryer. They have a large variety of other American menu options such as burgers, fried chicken, fried catfish which all hold their own. Be sure to try their grape leaves and falafel if you want a veggie option! The price is a little high but trust me, these guys are no chain. They have just recently started out and the hefty portions of food justify the price. So next time you are heading down East Wash give the Gyro House a try, you will not be disappointed!
4 I have only been here once, but my experience was pretty good.   The gyros and fries that I ordered came out quickly, were extremely tasty, and the portions were larger than I expected. The tzatziki was top notch as well.  The only real downside is that I'm not a fan of the location, but that doesn't interfere with the tastiness, so I will be back for more!
3 Gyro was above average. Gyro was made fresh to order, chunks of meat not strips like "Parthanons", diced tomatoes and cilantro, taziki sauce was alright. Fries were very good. Cash and carry kind of place, don't try and eat there. Must get soda from gas station, kind of awkward. It's best quality is that it's different from other places in town, but not necessarily better.
5 Great Mediterranean food! Fair pricing. I haven't tried the kibi yet, but everything else has been wonderful. It is a little out of the way and if you don't look for this place, you will think it is just a gas station.
5 The only spot I get gyros.   Awesome, Cheap eats.  3 people and our total all together was something like 10.76.   The gyro and fries gets me every time! When I start out I think 'hmmm could have been more fries in my paper bag"  the pain of over eating strikes and I no longer the question the wisdom of the portion.    Everything is good and cheap basically.  I was also blown away by the Baklava.    My only critiques are get some sweet and sour sauce, and add more ketchup to the bag.
2 I was hoping to find decent good middle-eastern fast food. This isn't it.  Great fries, good falafel, average gyro, thin, runny tzatziki, and a disappointing "kofta kebob" sandwich - it was just a cut-up frozen hamburger patty in a pita with some hummus. Not particularly tasty, and not worth the 15 minute wait (with nowhere to sit) at a somewhat unfriendly gas station.
4 I went here for my first time last week after reading a few Yelp reviews.  I'm glad I did!  I ordered two gyros and an order of large fries.  The guy behind the counter was friendly and even gave me a sample of hummus to dip my fries in (I took some hot sauce, too. I don't know what kind it was but it was yummy!).  The gyros were delicious and the fries and hummus were pretty darn good too. They are in the process of changing their menu so I was a little bummed I couldn't just get an order of falafel, but I'll keep checking back!    There is hardly any seating so I'd recommend taking it to go, unless you're alone and in a hurry.
2 It's not a gyro house anymore... it's now a soul food shop that also offers gyros as an afterthought. Because they had soul food specials all over the wall, I decided against ordering the gyro. I opted for the philly cheese steak... and well... it came on a hoagie roll - but it probably had close to a half a cup of mayonnaise on it. It was so incredibly disgusting - had to scrape it off in order to eat it.
4 So this place is in a gas station.  So there's that.  But overlook the smell of fumes as you order and I have to tell ya, it's pretty solid.   The woman ringing me up was DELIGHTFUL. I couldn't help but feel good cramming gyro and french fries in my face due to her pleasant disposition. It takes a bit longer but that's because everything is cooked to order. The menu is extensive, a weird compilation of southern and Chicago style (dogs, beef, gyro). I felt like the price was fair for the amount of food, about 8 bucks for a gyro pita and fries, and I liked that the meat was actually juicy. I do wonder if they're slicing it from a rotating deal or just heating it up, but I was also so hungry, it didn't matter as I scarfed it down.
2 This place is not a place for gyros.  I read the other reviews and they really sold me on Gyro House having really tasty and affordable gyros.  But I was disappointed.  I wonder if they are under new management/ownership.  Even though the Gyro House sign is still on the wall and gas station sign, my receipt says MCGEES.  As another recent reviewer mentioned, they have a large menu; from chicken wings to cheesecake, gyros to hot dogs.  If you're craving a deep-fried, college-cravings food, this is your place.  The price was average.  Not a deal nor a rip-off.  My gyro+fries cost about $8.  And the service was quick;  I got my food in about 5 minutes.  But about the taste... it taste as good as I would expect from a reheat/ or deep-fry anything place.  The cucumber sauce was really runny; the meat wasn't flavored much and chewed like it was reheated; the pita wasn't bad, but wasn't freshly warmed on a grill.  So, expect your average gyro.  For anyone who thinks the gyros here are the best they've ever tasted, you need to try Parthenon's or Plaka Taverna's.  I have to give it 2 stars since it doesn't live up to its name, nor its previous reviews.
