1 Didn't have a great first-time experience here. I arrived around noon on a Monday thinking the weekend crowds are gone and I'd be in and out. I arrive to find two people in chairs and three staff standing at the centre desk. I go through the sign-in procedure and the guy tells me it's a 25 minute wait. I don't know why, there are two people getting a haircut, and three of staff standing around. I wait 10 minutes and finally ask why I wasn't able to get a haircut as there was no just one person hanging around. This idiotic blonde said she didn't cut hair. Let me double-check the sign again, it does say you're a barber shop, but you don't cut hair. Ah. She offered me a free haircut which I refused. I wouldn't bother coming back.  Had someone mentioned up front that (a) there's only two people actually cutting hair and making money for the location, and; (b) non-hair-cutting staff should be out of sight.  I'm also shocked at the price for a simple haircut, I don't need all the bullshit bells and whistles.   I wouldn't recommend it. Simpletons running a retail outlet with very little concern, and awfully bad at that.
