3 I was pleasantly surprised to stumble into Bob's when I was desperate for some photo copies and envelopes to meet a deadline. The place is very simple and there aren't very many copiers so I am not sure if they could handle lots of people. The place was relatively sparse, but they had what I needed. Envelopes here are very cheap. Much better than Walgreens or the Post Office (the other two places I looked). I made several copies and bought two envelopes and somehow it only added up to $1.
5 printed 160 page word doc for $15. turn around time - 5 minutes. live saver!
1 Awful.  I went in to send a book back and they sealed the envelope before I could put the required materials in it.  Their response was handing me a roll of of packing tape and saying  "open it back up and then tape it shut yourself".  The antithesis of good service.  Do yourself a favor and walk the 1/2 block to UW bookstore.  They are cheaper and not rude.
1 Horrible customer service
