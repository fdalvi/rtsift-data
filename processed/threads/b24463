1 Is this what people do in Vegas? On friday take your lunch break and go cash you check?! WOW! THis place was insane! The line literally was from the teller all the way out the door! Luckily I am smarter than your average bear and I opt for the drive thru teller which still took me a while since they seem to share computer system, but I still saved time.
1 Do not let the name change from WAMU to Chase fool you, your money is not safe with Chase. With Chase in charge of WAMU, I suffered an identity theft which the fraud unit of WAMU detected and warned me about. Chase subsequently denied reimbursement because they could not figure out how the theft occured. Basically, accused me of theft.
4 There not much of a review I can write about a bank but at least I can say that I had banked with different company such as Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and US Bank and Chase has been the best.  They do have great customer service, they take care my money well, and I enjoy doing business with them.
4 As banks go, Chase has gone a long way to improve.  They now offer overdraft notfication so you can fix it before getting charged.   They have the scan your check feature allowing you to deposit checks without actually going to the bank.   And most importantly, everyone is very friendly.  I am glad I switched back.
