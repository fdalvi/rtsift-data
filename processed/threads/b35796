4 Love this Chevron. It is never too crowded here, there is a Terribles car wash, and a convince store for cigarets, drinks, beer, and etc. Also unlike other gas stations, this one is easy to turn in and out of
5 I always have a good experience going here, and I really like the location.  Their hot dog / chips / drink for $3 is killer if you just want to get some down & dirty gas station food, but they also run great specials on candy and drinks sometimes as well.  Customer service is always over the moon here!  It seems like these people actually care about what they do, which can be rare nowadays in ANY industry.  Also has an oil change station & car wash.  Woot!
4 Love visiting this place, not only because its my neighborhood Chevron, but because they are awesome. The have 2 for $3 specials on my fave Big Size candy, and specials on Rock Stars. Gotta love it!   They also have kick-ass specials on their food (which I haven't tried) but for all you gas station food junkies, you'll definitely love!   Clean, and customer service rocks more often than not. :-)
3 Came here on "emergency" for a gas fill up XD Was low on gas while in the area for work. This location sports a car wash area as well as have an on site garage for maintenance and smog check.   Fairly busy mid day. People lined up for smog check, and car wash. Quite the few people at the pumps as well.   Located fairly close to the entrance of 215. Convenient but means higher prices, sadly. Oh well.....
