1 The worst experience I have ever had at a Dr's office! Not only is the staff beyond rude but the Dr. is so snobby and uncaring. When I was pregnant with my daughter and was looking for plans to pay cash, her office told me directly that I was trash, and would be better at having my daughter at the county hospital! When asking to speak with the Dr, or the office manager, comes to find out I was speaking with the office manager and the Dr. never addressed my concerns. When a friend of mine called on my behalf to see if there was someone different I could speak to, they called her place of employment and filed a complaint of harassment on her! Never again!!
5 I absolutely love Dr. LaBranche I have been her patient since 2005 and couldn't see myself with anyone else. She is a specialist so her prices are higher but she is well worth it. I have 3 children and she has delivered 2 and we are now working on our 4th. The office staff is very friendly. This is not an office where you would find 5 doctors and never know which one you will have. There is 1 doctor 1 M.A. And 2 ladies up front. Sometimes the doc will be called in for a delivery or c-sec and I have to reschedule my appt. but I don't mind it just shows that if I have a problem she will be there for me. And she is right next door to the hospital which is awesome.
5 I truly believe I couldn't have gotten through my pregnancy without Dr. Labranche. She's the most caring doctor I've ever worked with and took me through every step with patience.
