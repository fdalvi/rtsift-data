2 Returning my rental car to PHX, I of course forgot that I needed to fill it up until I was pulling off the highway and following the signs to the rental car return. So here I am at the highway exit and my "gas station radar" isn't working too well. Hello, Yelp!  This station is only a few blocks away from the rental car pavilion and the airport. And because of it's proximity to the above, it doesn't have that warm and fuzzy feeling of a safe neighborhood.  I was seriously disappointed that the receipt printer on the pump wasn't working and I had to go into the store to get the receipt.  Follow 16th street south to reach the rental car return.
3 Made a small stop here to refuel my rental car before returning it. Standard self serve fuel station, competitive prices, no issues with card machine. Was in and out in under three minutes.
