4 Small, but they have a nice selection for the space and it's clean and smells nice. Their prices are a little high for some stuff, but all proceeds help fund a children's charity so you can't complain too much. They usually have a nice selection of kids clothes and toys to choose from.  Random note - they always need plastic shopping sacks if you have any at home.
4 I do not claim to be an avid thrift store shopper but I think this store can actually get me interested.  It's clean, no funny smells, variety is interesting.  I mainly went to find scrapbooking stuff.  I make pages for a nonprofit organization and thought I might find some cool stuff and I did.
4 I like this store.  Anything that helps children in need is a big drawing card for me.  It's not as big as some stores but the quality is better here.  The prices might be a bit higher as a result but you get what you pay for.  The employees are particularly nice and are really sincere in their thanks when you make a donation there.  They are dedicated to help making life for children who need all the help they can get.  It's easy to feel good about donating here.   The store has plenty of easy parking.  It's easy to get in and out of especially if someone tells you that by going around the back side of the building you can make an easy left or right onto Hghland.
4 Ooohh  Rob and Stucky furniture donates their floor models to the store directly.
1 I use to find good stuff here now and again, but now this place seriously sucks. Prices are WAY to high, and the place is small.
