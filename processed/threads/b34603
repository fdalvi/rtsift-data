5 My favorite Robertos in all of Vegas... Always clean, always fresh and friendly!!!
5 Excellent. Clean place. The food is delicious. I love their carnitas and carne asada the best!!!
4 Roberto's is one of my favorite places to get Mexican food~ It's cheap and good, not to mention, this location is really clean and empty!! So far, this is the only Roberto's that I really enjoy eating at because of its cleanliness. The staff is really friendly and pretty quick at preparing your food :)   Some of my favorite things to order is the carne asada enchilada or the burrito! Mmm! It makes me hungry just thinking about it! Also, to the left of the cash register there is a sauce bar where your fave hot sauces are located along with to-go cups and various veggies.  However, there are some things on the Roberto's menu that are just too small or too untasteful to be sold! So, be careful when ordering! Otherwise, enjoy a nice enchilada at this fun & clean location :)
