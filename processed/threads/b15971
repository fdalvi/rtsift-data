5 Quick, efficient wide range of services and reasonably priced. These guys had me in and out in minutes and were very friendly too! Next time I go swimming with my i-Phone I'll be taking it straight here.
5 Had a Line-X installed in my 2012 Tundra Crewmax. Looks fantastic! I dropped the truck off this morning and let them have the day with it. Never going to complain when work is done a few hours early. The place is very clean but be careful, you will have this uncontrollable urge to remove wallet from pocket and promptly empty. I can't talk toward pricing but I'm willing to shell out a few extra bucks for quality work.
5 I had 4 the truck put new suspension under my Landcruiser. Not an easy job or one for the inexperienced. They did a flawless job. Quick and simple. no hassles. no surprises. They produced exactly what they promised. I would highly recommend this shop for anyone looking for truck accessories, spray in bedliners, custom bumpers and more. These guys do great work.
5 The guys at 4 The Truck went out of their way to help me.  After buying a used truck from a local dealer I discovered it had a steering issue. 4 The Truck assisted me and explained clearly what was wrong. I went back to the dealer and they argued saying the truck is fine. The guys at 4 The Truck meet with me and the dealer to discuss the issue.  The dealer is now resolving it thanks to their support - and at no charge!
5 I had 4 The Truck spray my new Tundra's bed with LineX today.  It turned out awesome - flawless finish and absolutely no overspray anywhere.  Time will tell how durable the LineX is, but I'm very happy with the workmanship at 4 The Truck.
