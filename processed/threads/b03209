5 Good dentist!!
5 I do not like going to the dentist and I've had bad experiences in the past but Smile Makers is wonderful. My husband and I and two sons have gone and love it. I had a crown put on and old fillings replaced. I couldn't be happier. I would highly recommend them to anyone. Love the staff!
5 Great experience here.. friendly staff, professional, and changed my mind about dentistry... wow
