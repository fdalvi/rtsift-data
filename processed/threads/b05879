4 Located in the Cheyenne Crossings Wal Mart shopping center this place blows away payless shoes & Wal-mart. You get 1 pair of shoes and 50% off the 2nd pair so I found 2 pairs of shoes for $60, when I normally go to JC Penneys or somewhere in the mall and spend 50-60 a pair. So I feel I got a tremendous savings on top quality name brand shoes and the service was great too.
4 I heard about this place from a friend who thought I needed a new pair of shoes. So I went in and the employees were just so helpful and nice. It took me a while to find a pair of shoes that I really wanted, and as soon as I got to the register the man asked me if I had a rewards card with them. When I told him no he literally had me one in less than 2 minutes and saved me almost $20. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants cheap name brand shoes especially with their constant buy one get the 2nd half off deal.
