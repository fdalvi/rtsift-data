3 you get what you expect  its a holiday inn express hotel  the price is fair  the rooms are clean the location is a bit away from the centre of edinburgh, but the busstop is directly in front of the hotel  so you can easily reach the old town. the very friendly staff is a definite plus of the hotel. my personal result: okay for a one-night-stay, but if i want to stay in edinburgh for longer i would choose another and less buisness-like hotel!
