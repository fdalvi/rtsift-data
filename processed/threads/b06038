5 OK. This is HUGE news. I have found the absolute best deli in Las Vegas. Seriously. Bob's East Side Deli offers a great selection for breakfast and lunch. You would never notice the actual building, because it is smack dab in the middle of two office parks, but if you find it, it's like finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Hot subs, cold subs, salads, side dishes, and great homemade desserts are just the beginning of the lunch menu. The bread for all of the subs and sandwiches is baked fresh as well. The actual deli is not a place I would recommend  for a quiet, peaceful lunch. It is buzzing with traffic constantly. Businessmen, students, and nearby residents jam pack this smaller deli around lunch time, so make sure you know what to order before getting to the front of the line. Or, they offer delivery, faxed orders, and call-ins. If you work in the vicinity, or are simply searching for the perfect sub, Bob's is the place for you.  Recommended sub: Marino's Special, which is a meat lover's delight!   Recommended dessert: The chocolate brownie is perfection wrapped in plastic.
5 BY FAR the BEST Deli in Vegas. Being from NY originally this is thebest place for a great, no PHENOMINAL breakfast sandwich. The sandwhiches are incredible. I am not sure what kind of bread he uses but it is the BEST. I cant believe that more people do not know about this place. It is hidden in a more commerical area but I literally go to eat there almost every weekend. I cant get enough of the double egg cheese and sausage breakfast sandwich! If you have not tried it you need to!!
1 Don't do delivery. My food came totally messed up in every way. Not good at all.
5 I have been eating Bob's Deli for over 10 years!  Nothing beats it!
5 Omg! This place is definitely buried treasure. Its none of that corporate bs like from subway, quiznos, or capriottis. It just screams local and awesome. I used to go there every morning after work to get sandwiches and breakfast. Or sandwiches for breakfast. They are only open for lunch. It is a mom and pops sandwich joint. They slice their own deli, and EVERYTHING is homemade. The prices are so cheap, and you get a good amount of food for the cost. It is a bargain. I sandwiches are huge and range about 6 to 7 bucks. I personally love their reuben and corned beef hash sandwich on rye. Its full of flavor, and loaded with meat. As far as breakfast dishes, I recommend their breakfast steak sandwich, and their 2.99 corned beer breakfast. You also have to get a side of hash browns with anything! The hash browns are lightly brown, extra crispy, and soft in the center. Just the way a hash brown should be. I mean...I even close my eyes sometimes when I take bites of their hash browns.  Oh...and their service is awesome. They get very personal with you, and they speak to you with your name as if they've known you for years. They remember faces, even if you only go there a few times. Definitely come here for lunch or breakfast.
3 **Summary**        - Locale - Nested on the side of an office building. It's definitely hidden (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/750iLCqKvDnIWzRSRSUlrg?select=ExOaTaj3LrN2lyNA94wD6Q).        - Value - You get a decent lunch for under $10. **Price**        - $5 - $10 for Lunch (http://bobseastsidedeli.com/lunch-menu.html) **Ordered**        - Marino's Special - Cold Sub with Ham, Salami, Cappocolla, Pepperoni, Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, Oil & Vinegar (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/750iLCqKvDnIWzRSRSUlrg?select=PQ-AGFS1XJ-wMlfkdQKm0w).        - Steak Philly Topped with Cheese, Mushrooms, Onions & Peppers (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/750iLCqKvDnIWzRSRSUlrg?select=Gt-AZVFAwKf6wJgasZz1cg).        - Chicken Fingers & Fries - Five giant chicken fingers and fries for $7 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/750iLCqKvDnIWzRSRSUlrg?select=qFaFlLvo7DDiNqAWhAOvFw). **Recommendations**        - This is a great alternative to Quizno's and Subways. The price isn't too steep and the food's decent.
5 There are no "sandwich artisans" here, just friendly people who care about what they put across their counter.  If you are looking for a place where you are served with a smile by people who really take pride in their work, then this place is for you.  The bread is great and the sandwiches taste like they should.  This is a great kept secret in town and it's too bad.  They could compete with any of the chain locations.  It has an old school neighborhood feel and you can't get away from the charming staff.  This is a family run joint with a family feel.  If I want to get a bite at a place with character, this is where I go.   Do yourself a favor and get the roast beef sandwich.  You will thank yourself for it.
4 Great local place!  I love places like this.  Family owned, and knows how to treat their guests.  Besides that, the food is great!  I had the Philly and Reuben there before and they were good!    Pro:  Hospitality Food and portions of orders.  Cons:  Closes in the afternoon.  -- However, considering their location, I understand.
4 First time visit. The sandwich was great. Had the corned beef Reuben. The french fries were OK. My friend had the chicken Philly. Said it was great. We will go back. Good prices, great service, good food.
4 This place is good. Really good, actually. It's sort of hard to find, tucked away in some pseudo-industrial officeplex on E Patrick (just west of Del Sol, on the north side of the street). You can definitely tell it's a locally owned and operated kinda place. It would get five stars, but my corned beef sandwich was, though completely satisfactory, not stellar. My friend's meatball sub, however, WAS stellar. So get that. They make their meatballs fresh by hand. In fact, the owner is the one who made our sandwiches. Nice guy, in an east coat deli proprietor sorta way. Really, they deserve five stars just for the "no students in the bathroom" signs on the bathroom doors. Pretty damn funny if you ask me. Definitely worth checking out for a quick lunch, especially on your way to or from McCarran. As far as delis in Las Vegas go, you're really not gonna do any better. And that's not a bad thing.
2 We came here for breakfast.. so I can't comment on the lunch menu. The breakfast I make at home is way better. The breakfast menu is so simple it hurts to talk about. The bacon reminded me of my days in the military chow hall or buffet style bacon that sits in a silver container filled with oil. I imagine the lunch side of this deli is where its at, but we eat at so many other lunch spots, I doubt I will ever know..
2 So this review has nothing to do with the food as my sandwich was delicious. However, the service rubbed me the wrong way.  I came to order some lunch with a coworker and was next in line to order. A man, who I assume was a regular customer, was standing behind me. Rather than take my order the cashier asked the man behind me what he wanted that day and completely ignored the fact that I was standing right in front of her. It was SO rude!  Way to wow a new customer. I won't be going back. There are plenty of other options in that area for lunch that offer much better customer service. The food wasn't so good that I would tolerate bad customer service for a sandwich. Off to Subway!
4 My coworkers and I order breakfast from Bob's a few times a month.  The Hungry Man Hero is a huge breakfast sandwich.  It is so good.  You pick your meat (ham, sausage or bacon) and how you want your eggs(i go over medium) and it is put on a huge sub roll with cheese and fried hashbrown patty.  I usually have half for breakfast and the other half for lunch.  It is that big.  How much you ask?  Only $3.99...really it's $3.99.  We always get it delivered.  They can get busy at times but they always get it to us quick.  We have ordered a few times for lunch.  Lunch is average.  Seems like most things are pre packaged, like frozen and then cooked or fried. Prices are cheap and there is no minimum for delivery which is nice.  Def give them a try if you work or live in the area.
5 Just stopped by for lunch ... I have heard of it before and am surprised I haven't tried this place. Me and my friend ordered and shared an Eggplant Parm sandwich and a Pastrami Reuben ... Both sandwiches were delish ... I will for sure get a Reuben again ... The staff was helpful with suggestions and very nice .. I think they deserve 5 stars this time !!!
5 Got the Marino Sandwich and Bob's Favorite.  Okay, my first time here.  Delicious.  I'll be back.  Stopped here on a whim.  Had read about it, never could find it.  It's a do over.
5 Just stopped in for a breakfast burrito today. this was awesome. a must try!
3 It can be hard to find. Just drive around the building you will see it!  I do believe that if you are looking for a great sub or sandwich you might have found a great spot.  We ordered salads, and don't get me wrong there was absolutly nothing wrong with them.  Its just that there was nothing special about them either.  I had the grilled chicken salad and it came with nothing more than tomato wedges, and mixed lettuce, the dressing and a chicken breast.  Tasted great the dressing was great, just nothing special.   The staff was very friendly and the food was good.  The dining room was clean and well kept.  Nothing fancy but for a quick lunch, who cares.
5 Great food.  Great service.  Great people.  Great Value. Best sausage, peppers and onions around!
4 If you're on the East side and you're hankering for a sandwich, but you don't want to go the route of a chain, then Bob's is here for you!  Located in a business park off of Patrick Lane, Bob's is an unassuming joint. There is a sign leading the way for you though, so do not be afraid of the business-like exterior. Inside is a no-frills sandwich shop bringing you cold and hot sandwiches alike. Tables and chairs scream community kitchen, but do no be afraid, go ahead and order a sandwich.   I went with the simple cold, turkey, cheese, and salami with everything. Lettuce, tomatoes, and red onions. Also comes with mayo, which by the way, you should probably ask for light mayo if you are watching your figure, OR if you just don't want to have an over-slathering of mayo on your sandwich. Next time I'm there I'll opt for the lighter option. Other than the mayo the sandwich was great. Just enough meat and cheese and fillers in my opinion. There wasn't one prominent part of the sandwich. The bread was also incredibly soft making for a great texture wrapped around the meat, cheese, and veggies.  My husband went for the French Dip, while on the smallish side, he said was good. We also shared a bag of chips.  Bob's is simplistic. Sandwiches. Chips. Salami. Cheese. Bam. Bam. Bam. Don't expect any crazy aioli sauces or fancy-pants toppings for your sandwiches here.   I'll be back when I'm in the mood for a good deli sandwich.
5 corned beef, pastrami, and love. all the things u get at bob's deli. thanks for remembering me guys. didnt show up there for 3 years and walk in and they even remembered my name! food awesome people awesome. feels and tastes like new york again
4 I was getting my car serviced over at Discount Muffler (great place by the way!) My belly was growling after another lady walked in with McDonald's, so I pulled out my Yelp app and it led me down the block to Bob's Deli.  This is by far the cheapest breakfast that I've had in a long time...corned beef hash, eggs, and toast all for under $4!  Most of their breakfast deals are under $5!  The corned beef hash was not overly salt, and it was a nice mix of corned beef and potatoes.  And you can never go wrong with some over easy eggs....now if only it came with rice =).
4 Somewhat off the beaten path and not an easy find, but the sandwiches are terrific.  Exactly what you would expect out of a quality deli.  The variety in the menu is good and they are more than accommodating if you want to make any modifications.  Solid place for a hearty sammie.
5 yum yum yummy !!!!!!!!  I only came here real quick for something to put in my tummy while i was running errands.  I wasnt starving so i got a muffin and a large diet coke....  The drink cup was HUGE !!! And only 1.83 !!!  The muffin was amazing....so good and fresh and big !!!  Cant wait to go back and try more from their menu when im a but more hungry.
4 Having family ties to New York this place is a hidden treat in Las Vegas. The corn beef and pastrami sandwiches reminded me of the old Jewish deli in new work city. Friendly people who want to make sure you get exactly what you want and make sure you leave satisfied and full. The menu options are plentiful so I'm sure that there is something for everyone. I wish they were open later so get there early! Can't wait to go back for another delicious treat.
5 LOVE this place!!!! I've never had anything bad here! Great little hidden away spot!!! LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!
5 I have been going to Bobs since I was in middle school. I do have to say that they have the absolute best chicken fingers! Everyone there is nice as well. They are always very cheery and happy when you go in there. Not only does this place serve good food but it smells like food heaven when you walk in too. They have great quality food and service for a great price!
5 This is the best deli sandwich in the Green Valley area.  Jan and Mr. Marino is genuine owners who do work the restaurant.  The portions are for the hungry man, the working man and my favorite is the Marino's Special cold sandwich.  The trick is Bob's is a luncheon and not open during the weekends.
4 Herd about this spot from my girl and have to admit it's not bad.   I'll be back
5 YUM! this place has Amazing breakfast! I Come here quite often! Very friendly staff and fast service! You also get a bang for your buck!
4 Tried Bob's for the first time this morning. I ordered the "hungry man hero" and it was very good, and cheap. My girlfriend had the veggie omelette and she liked that as well. Bread was freshly baked. Our main gripe is that everything is served on disposable styrofoam, even for people dining in. Seems like they could cut down on all the waste by using reusable plates/glasses/utensils, or at least paper plates/cups, which would be more environmentally friendly than all of that styrofoam.
5 Hungry man special is the way to go. 3 eggs, 3 bacon, hashbrowns and toast of your choice.  At a great price. As always staff is friendly.
