5 I've been here several times. I was recommended this place by a coworker and have been very happy with the work they do.   They have excellent prices and friendly staff. They only take cash, which is kind of a pain, but for a cut, highlights and style it's well under $100, which is excellent. I definitely recommend you ask for Denise M. She's a sweetie and you'll feel like you've known her for years after just a visit or two. I highly recommend this place.
5 Dawn did my hair here and I love it! She listened to how I wanted it cut and colored. I always hear scary stories of how some hair stylist go crazy and do what you didn't want. Not here :]
5 I've been coming here for the past 5 or so years and love it. The girls are always nice and they make you feel extremely comfortable.   I definitely recommend getting your hair done by Alma or if you're in need of waxing or a facial, Dee is the gal for you! I sing praises to my patients and friends about them and I hope you give them a try!
