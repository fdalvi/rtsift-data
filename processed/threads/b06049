2 Needed a new transmission and they assured me it was doable and I was quoted half the prices of the dealership. I should have known better, but I was working part-time and unemployed.  10 business days later I got my car back and had to pay $1000 over the quote. My car never ran right.   Courteous staff, probably great for lube jobs and other smaller fixes.
5 Just had an oil change done at for $9.95, WOW, who does oil changes for $9.95 these days.  The last oil change I paid for was over $35 through Jiffy Lube.  Needless to say, I'll definitely be back for my next oil change.  Staff was also very courteous and friendly.
1 True Story and my first yelp review,  I am not one  a disgruntled employee, but a customer who was told to "GET OUT". I went there for an $13 (w. tax & fees) oil change. Once they are done changing the oil, they check your car. One of the workers called me and told me to go talk to this Asian guy who was working on my car.  He showed me that my car's water pump was leaking. And I told him that its not, and as I was about to explain him that Toyota fixed that issue because it was covered in the warranty. What he saw was the dried up coolant from the leak before it was fixed. He told me to Get Out of the shop.   This lead to 10 minute me arguing with him about their customer service and how they should handle it. When I went back to their office area another customer left because they didn't like how I was treated.   So, in short dont go there. You will get you cheap oil change, but with that you will get a really cheap customer service.
