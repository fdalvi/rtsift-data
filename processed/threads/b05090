1 Don't let people drive your car,  it could end up in a place like this! hey claim they don't go through your vehicle, but the person that I took up here to pick up there car had a few bucks in it!  OF COURSE IT'S NOT IN THERE!  Some body got a nice little free lunch for a couple of days! But they charge you to go to your car and get your registration.  Ummmmm, isn't that where your suppose to keep your registration?   If it's  in your car, you get that towards your car getting out of jail!  If it's not in there, then your $hit out of luck!  What the hell can you do!  Nothing, if you want your car!
1 This place deserves to catch on fire and everybody that works there die a very slow painful death.  Seriously.  Towed the car stole everything in it.  On top of that they drew with there finger in the dust on the car and wrote things such as the "N" word all over it.  Then of course lied and denied all of it.  Karma is coming for you guys and I hope when it does that you think about about all the horrible things you have done to people over the years. F*** off!
1 Wish you could give this place a freakin zero star! Absolutely worst place to have your car towed to! My brother had is car towed here.. Prepare to have your car broken into, your registration stolen.. Seriously they go thru your car steal important shit then they charge you $40 bucks for even going back to look at your car but then once you find out your registration was stolen your not able to take one thing from YOUR car until you provide proof of registration! Set up? Yes I think so! Don't even get me started on the worthless employees that work there.. But then again keep stuffing your fat face karma will come around
