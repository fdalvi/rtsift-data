4 This dollar store is a cute lil gem tucked in the back of the Fry's Shopping center.  I just moved into this neighborhood last week so I stopped in on part of my 'get to know the area' walking tour.  Lemme just tell you... this place has great deals!  And ex... Rubbermade tupperware that would cost $$ at any other store is only $1 here.  Picture frames that run you $5 and up at other stores are only $1 here.  I also got a silicon rubber spatula for only $1.    This store isn't good for all of your needs but it's fun to browse for cheap holiday decorations, party supplies, kitchen gadgets, and more.   See ya there!
5 Love the store! Awesome variety of things :)
4 I'm quite impress with the fun items they have there. If you need quick pick up items that are less expensive I would really think of this place to stop first. They have just about everything except food.
5 I like the black lady that works here! She always make me laugh and she is always in a good mood!
