4 Sparklefest and color wonderland!  Charming Charlie already took over Town Square and Tivoli Village, and it has finally landed in The District.  In the old Talbot's location right near the center of the shopping area is a gleaming, well-lit Charming Charlie!  The old dressing room area was knocked down and the use of space is impressive.  There are so many affordable options for a lady going out on the town.  Dresses, shoes, accessories are just the tip of the iceberg.  Come in for necklaces, earrings, rings, bracelets, barrettes, hair clips, clutches...anything you could possibly need to accessorize your outfit.  Forgot to get a gold necklace with blue stones?  Charming Charlie has it!  The store is color coded for easy hunting.  It is a positive sign that such a popular store has opened in the struggling area.
2 This store has such a great selection of colors and styles..sadly the quality is very cheap. I've bought a handful of accessories from here only to have them fall sorry or lose gems/peices after just a few uses. It's kind of like a huge Forever 21 accessory section . Won't be spending my money here again.
4 This store is cute. I love bling, and lots of it.  The store is for the most part, color coordinated, and jam packed with merchandise.  The sales associates didn't bother us much, but did ask us how we were doing, and then checked up on us a little while later.  Decent prices, some cute, some ugly stuff.
4 Checked out this store yesterday and it was cute and cheap.  The display of colorful handbags caught my eye, so my friend and I went inside to take a look.  Everything is color coordinated, there are handbags with rhinestones and studs in cute displays.  They had everything from clothes, handbags, wristlets, cellphone covers and cases and costume jewelry displayed everywhere.  It's probably really popular with the teen and pre-teen set.  I didn't buy anything this time, but next time would probably buy a handbag or wristlet!
