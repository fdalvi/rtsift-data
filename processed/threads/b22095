5 Josh Lutz, the owner of Southwest Premier, conducted a prepurchase inspection for me yesterday. The entire process was amazingly smooth, from initial scheduling to going over the final report.  Josh arrived before I did, and I was 10 minutes early. He explained to me exactly what he was doing and what he was looking for every step of the way. The concern and attention to detail that he brings to his customers is truly amazing.  Next time I'm in the real estate market, Southwest Premier is getting my business again. I'm also going to recommend Josh & Co to my friends who are in the market.
5 We had our inspection a few days ago and Mike was AMAZING. I have worked with another inspector and he wasn't as nice and patient as Mike. My dad is English as a second language and Mike was wonderful. He had a printed report and an electronic one which was impressive. I will be going back to Southwest Premier Home Inspection and referring them to my friends from this point forward!
