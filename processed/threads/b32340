5 So I've been looking for a good place to smoke hookah since I moved out here from California. I've tried other places but always left disappointed.  My friends and I were hesitant to try this place because it wasn't on Yelp.  Shortly after we realized that was a damn shame because these guys are awesome.   Their hookah is amazing. No burning and always hits strong. The environment is dark but not too dark.  They have an awesome selection with 45 flavors. There was music playing at a perfect level. They offered world class customer service. From my experience at hookah lounges, that is a rarity. Its conveniently located right across from the Tempe Improv and right behind Devil's Advocate Bar. They also stay open late so if you get kicked from Devil's Advocate at 2am roll on over and smoke some fine shisha.
5 We decided to go here due to a long wait at another hookah lounge. I was kinda hesitant to go in because I couldn't find any reviews on it. But decided to go anyways.  Glad we did. Their hookah is amazing & customer service is the best I've had at any hookah lounge. Hookah hit strong & never burned. The atmosphere was chill & the music was at the perfect level so that you could converse w/ friends.  Definitely will be returning.
1 Extremely boring, tacky music choice, rude staff. Makes me miss my usual hookah bar in California. If you are so inclined as to go, don't take Josh's recommendations on the best flavors. So gross.
5 This place is great! If you talk to anybody they have a suggestion for a great flavor. You can bring in food from another place to enjoy and just enjoy a great atmosphere. With the music that someone has an issue with you can just talk to the DJ to get a suggestion they are MORE than accommodating. They have a great happy hour prices!  Overall great prices, great people, and a great time! If you have the right mind :)
