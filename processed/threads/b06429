1 This is a horrible institution. They charge non account holders a $10.00 fee to cash a check drawn on their account. They call it a "processing fee". What have we come to? This is INSANE!!!
1 hate this place. it smells like poo and the employees are rude to me. I asked questions on how to withdraw a large amount of money (for rent and bill payment purposes) and they had to explain the whole e-checking withdrawing fee. I can understand it in a more polite tone, but these women wanted to truly get rid of me and my "troublesome" errand. I still can't get over the biggest point is that it smells like POO. I actually looked around if there was a bathroom or if someone was even nearby and probably assumed they blew an anal gasket. Nope. How can a bank branch smell like poo so badly? This place sucks for being unprofessional and smelly.
4 This location off of Sahara and Valley View is in an out of the way shopping center, but if the need to do some banking arises.. then you can stop by this branch. It is a very small office, but the 2 times that I have been there in the past few months, the clerks were able to serve me quickly and without any troubles. The clerk was helpful and offered an alternative to the transaction that I was wanting to do for a cheaper price- cashiers check vs money order. I will definitely return when I am on this side of town and need to get some cash o la.
