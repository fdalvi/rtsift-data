4 Of all the local supermarkets I have around me, I like this one the most for one reason. There is a staff member that works here who is easily the happiest man alive. Always smiling, asking how your day is going and what the rest of your day is going to bring.  His name is Kyle and if you ever find yourself being served by him, pay attention to how happy you are when you leave. As for the store, it's also one of the hald decent "express" stores in the area. Sometimes there are stock level issues on the dailies such as bread and milk but all in all it is a very clean and well maintained store selling everything that you need to top up your shopping with.  If I had one complaint about the shop it would be like the rest of the reviews, there are sometimes occasions when you can stand in a queue for 5 minutes longer than needed after being followed around the shop by a security guard at the weekend all whilst there are staff members walking about chatting to each other.  It's local and it delivers. You sometimes get Guinness draught for Â£1 a can too which is good.
