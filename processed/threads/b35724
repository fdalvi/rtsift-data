1 Centurylink is the WORST company I have ever had to deal with.  My internet and landline have been knocked out now off and on for over 2 months.  When I call them to resolve this problem, they transfer me around until they eventually hang up on me.  I want to disconnect ALL their services forever, and tell EVERYONE what a worthless company they truly are!!!!
1 I switched with them thinking I could save some money by bundling my package and get the same type of service I had before. NOT!! The internet service is a joke. Maybe its because I live in Fountain Hills. They shouldn't even offer the service here.
1 CenturyLink needs a hostile take over from someone, anyone.  CenturyLink is the most worthless, inept company I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with.  I hope someone at CenturyLink reads this so they know what a terrible job they are doing at everything.  Literally everything.  Just sell your company to Cox and let them do a better job without even trying.
1 Yelp really needs a zero star option.  Words cannot quite explain how awful this company is.  I would need pictures that Yelp would not approve of so my words will have to do.  Actually, I would be wasting my time because there are dozens upon dozens of reviews on here that all say the same thing.  If you want weeks of frustration, crappy service, tech support from India, etc. then please, use Centurylink.    Also, Centurylink, just know that no amount of name changes or mergers will be able to adequately hide how awful every aspect of your service is.  I vow to make it known to anybody with ears how truly horrible you are on every level.
