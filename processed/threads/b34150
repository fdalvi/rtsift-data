4 This is one of two locations for this practice.  They have on staff here several specialists, and so can address all aspects of your eye health.  They may cost a tad more than a simple optometrist, but they can deal with anything you have.  Our daughter had a sty removed several years ago (by Dr Mansueto), and my wife and I have been coming here for full check-ups for even longer, starting with Dr Lewis (who has since retired).  This last visit I was informed that I will probably need cataract surgery in about 10 years.  Unless things change with this practice I will come here for that procedure.  I've seen both Dr Matsumoto and Dr Konti, and both seem very competent.
2 Okay, I have not been here yet. So this ratings is just by phone conversations.I am schedule for an appointment in May.  When I called, the scheduler was not very pleasant, like she does not want to be there, the questions I had asked 2 -3 questions about their service, she had an attitude, I felt uncomfortable.  I called back again to ask another question about insurances, this time the front office picked up, same attitude. She did answer my question but Its like she is upset with the jobs, as I was about to say- okay- bye, she hung up ( I don't think shes upset with me) I gave 2 stars for bad customer service by phone. I will update this after my appointment.
