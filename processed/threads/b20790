2 Vision Express is a chain opticians operating in pretty much every town center. You would imagine they are all the same but the customer service in this branch is beyond disappointing.  I had my eyes tested in Vision Express in Perth and was given a prescription. Due to my poor student status, the nice lady gave me a form to fill out to receive a NHS discount. For that reason I couldn't pick my glasses that day, but the optician told me it would be fine for me to fill my prescription at any Vision Express branch.  So once I received my money off coupon I toddled on down to Vision Express in the St James Centre. Well according to the rather scary woman behind the counter there was no way in hell I could fill my prescription at any other store and it had to be the store I had my eyes tested in. We argued back and forth for a good 20 minutes before she turned me away. Poor show, you don't want my money? FINE. I will take it elsewhere. Thanks for the inconvenience.   Funny how apparently I could only get my glasses at the one Vision Express branch where I had my eyes tested yet Tesco's opticians were happy enough to sell me some.   Next time I won't use Vision Express.
