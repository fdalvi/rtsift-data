5 I wish everybody to experience such a quality time as the one you will experience in this spa  The village is pretty much what I wish to find when I get to paradise  Love it
5 I love this spa and Rochelle is the absolute best! I've had several treatments  here and now I only go to Rochelle. She does an amazing job with brow design, facials, peels etc. I wouldn't go to any other spa in Scottsdale!
5 The Village at Gainey Ranch is the best! Great environment, friendly staff, many amenities. I get a great workout in here as well as take advantage of the excellent spa.   Snow is my favorite for my manicures and pedicures.   As for my hair cuts, Crissy rocks!
