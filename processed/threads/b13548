5 I love the service. You can pretty much find anything middle eastern here. The owner is extremely helpful and will get you anything you need even if they don't carry it.
5 Excellent food and service!  The "Monday Special" (Chicken with Pommegranate) is fantastic!
5 Saffron market is the best persian market in the Scottsdale. The owner especially orders items for me. Food is fresh and service is great.
5 I've been going to this place for years now...it used to be just a tiny little market with almost nothing in it, and it still kind of is.  Now they have a little cafe next door with a nice mix of Greek Lebanese, Persian, etc. etc. foods.  The market is still there and they have almost nothing there, but they've got the staples.   It's my go to place for the best imported tzatziki!  Need a nice variety of fresh baked non leavened bread?  they've got it!  They also make fresh hummus and babaganoj...  I also can't say enough about the employees! So helpful and knowledgeable.
5 Thrilled to have a store that carries Indian spices in Scottsdale! Not to mention that it's fresh and the people are extremely friendly!
