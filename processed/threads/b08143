3 The food is good and the prices are cheap. Just make sure you check your bag before you leave the store or the drive thru. I go here all the time and about half of the time they don't give me everything I ordered.   They're normally happy to get you everything once you point it out to them though. If you order one combo meal and don't ask for anything special like no ice in your drink or no pickles on your burger or an extra hash brown you'll probably get everything. But ordering it your way most likely will lead to it being done the wrong way until you ask to have it fixed.   The 2 tacos for a buck is always good and they always have a promo menu item that is normally very good as well.
5 Man U see me with a white shirt on and u fill my drink up so full n throw my food at me so fast n then only give me one napkin... DAMN. Shit was delicious tho.  Mmmmmmmk
4 Blazing Chicken Sandwich is pretty good!  But for the price stick with Chic Fil A.  It's about 10x better for the same price!  This store pretty much delivers what you expect for a Jack in the Box.  Nothing worse, nothing better.  Tough to access this location with a big truck and trailer though.  Pretty small parking area.
