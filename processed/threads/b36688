5 Niccol is really great at what she does.  I loved not having to leave home.
5 This was my very first massage!  Niccol made me very comfortable and explained everything to me ahead of time so there was no surprises.  She also gave me a lot of choices which made me feel even more comfortable.  It was WONDERFUL!  I enjoyed it a lot and felt refreshed and renewed when it was over.  I will be going back and would highly recommend her for a massage.  Especially if you are a first timer like I was.
5 Niccol is an excellent massage therapist!  I went to her with some serious back and neck tension and she was able to work it out.  I loved how attentive she was when I told her why I was there.  She is a very caring and fun woman and it was a great experience.   The atmosphere was also very nice and I have scheduled my next appointment.
5 I wanted to give my wife a massage after her graduation. Both my mom and mother in law were in town from the east coast and Central America. This was the first time I had all three of the greatest women in my life were all together so I purchased a massage for my wife, mom and mother in law. *Quick Note* I bought my wife a massage two years ago but when she went into the location she did not like the environment so she never used the service. When I heard that Niccol took her work into her clients home so I was confident that having Niccol come to our house would help with the uncertainty my wife had of not having a massage before. I was right! All three ladies received a massage and they were very pleased with Arizona Massage & Healing.
