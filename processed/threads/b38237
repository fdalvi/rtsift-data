4 This airport Starbucks is really nice and open. There's plenty of seating and there's several key tables located near posts with A/C for charging the phone/laptop or blow-drying one's hair.   Service at this Starbucks is quick and because the atrium-based Starbucks is prior to TSA, it far less busy than the small, old dirty location just past the TSA.  Great job and funny barista!
2 Really manager, you want to argue with me when I was given clearly a days-old croissant and thought you should know?!  Not even worth arguing.   Extra star is because they gave me a small glass of water with no hassle. I actually wanted to buy their bottled water but it was room temperature for whatever reason.
4 Giving this Starbucks 4 stars because of the customer service of the morning staff only. Been to this location at other times of the day and nothing compared to the morning staff. They are very friendly and do their best to great everyone with a smile. They actually take into account people are flying. I do agree with other reviews of the pastries. They suck and they are never that fresh but they also aren't the same pastries you find in the stand-alone Starbucks.
3 Great tasting half-caf.  But, the service was a bit slow for me.  I don't normally come to an airport with a lot of time to spare, so pulling up to the starbucks and getting my coffee in less than 5 minutes would be appreciated.  Nevertheless, I had time to spare, so the long line and wait wasn't much of a problem this time.  I think that perhaps they were caught off guard by the crowd on this day.    One thing I've noticed is that Starbucks franchise service is not as good as the service one received in the Starbucks stores that are owned by Starbucks.  Oh well, grab your coffee and drink up then pull up your laptop and charge up!
1 Mmmm tasty croissant right out of the ice box and directly into my bag.  I love paying $2.50 for over priced cold hard bread.    Keep up the good work!
