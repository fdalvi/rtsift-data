5 Amazing selection of antiques, incredibly curated and organized. Don't miss the upstairs rooms too.
4 There's not much to do in Cave Creek, AZ.  However, we do enjoy coming up here once in a while to browse the antique shops.  This store is one of the largest in this small town.  There's 2 levels of shopping and a wide variety of dealer booths to choose from.  On our last trip, The Better Half found an old pair of Gucci sunglasses dating back to the 60's....they were very cool and retro looking.  This is the type of treasure we love to find in places like this.  If you stop here, don't sell yourself short....be sure to check out the room upstairs.  Return Factor - 87%
4 Two stories of great finds!
1 The absolute worst customer service I have ever received. Before even entering the store the woman working there was incredibly rude and belittling. I would never ever return to this place.
