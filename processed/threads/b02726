2 Food is ok for the price. Menu never changes though. Can get boring.
5 Well I am not going to tell you it is the most fancy or fine dinning, But it is one of me and my friends favorite places in Arizona. The menu doesn't  change this is true but there has been three other buffet places in Casa Grande and out of them TWO has closed. One had a larger and fancier menu and it was right next door. It still went under. I grew up on this food and my friends and I will still drive 45 mins to get to the restaurant.
2 = = = = = =  WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET!  = = = = = =   This mid-sized buffet features a small selection of 25 food items.  The food is marginally ok but I think you're much better off to spend  just $.79 to $1.49 more down the the street at China Buffet, 1677 E. Florence.  Lunch Buffet $5.50, beer served.
3 Well this was the last buffet in Casa Grande for Rand H. and I to try. The place is a little old and beat up but not to bad. The buffet was small for a Chinese buffet (about 25 items) and everything i tried was good. So for $5.50 I left the place quite full a pretty good value meal but if I had a list of Casa Grande buffets they would be at the bottom. Will I return? no.
