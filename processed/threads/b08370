2 Considering most burgers I've had at ghost towns and tourist traps, I wasn't expecting much. However, though the fries weren't anything to write home about, the burger at Mammoth wasn't bad at all. The beer in the plastic cups was cold. Sat at the picnic tables outside and had lovely mountain views. Servers were a little slow, but nice. I wouldn't drive out to Goldfield to eat here, but if you're already there, you've had worse lunches than what you'll find at the Mammoth.
5 I know other reviewers had issues with this place but my family really enjoyed it.  The food was great and the prices were reasonable. You can't beat the views either. Our waitress was attentive and helpful. The owner / manager was too funny. He walked around with a gun on his hip and spoke with an Eastern European accent.  I thoroughly enjoyed my BBQ sandwich and my wife and daughter enjoyed sharing an NY Strip.  We will be back.
5 The Best !   great food and Service
5 Great local place--have patience they are busy during season!
