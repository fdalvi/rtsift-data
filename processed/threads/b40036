5 This is one of my favorite places in all of Las Vegas. The Art Gallery always has the most amazing pieces, and if I were rich, I'd buy everything!  My favorite part of the Armory is that every 3rd Saturday of the month they hold a super fun event from around 7pm - Midnight. Tons of people come, there is music, food, drinks and of course ... art!  Definitely check this place out, and get your wallet ready because you will want to buy some amazing things. :)
5 What a plethora of talent all under one roof!!  One can simply not have enough pieces of art from each member of this artistic community. A must see place.
5 This place is awesome! Really cool art and great local shows. These guys are really keeping the local music and art scene alive in vegas! Go check them out! Really nice people working and it's hipster free!
5 I honestly have never met such an amazing and eclectic group of artists and people. They all have awesome art and individuality, provide awesome live music and events all the time. Probably one my most favorite places to hang out and do the occasional crafts :)
5 This place is pretty small and extremely hot but has lots of good energy :) it's a great atmosphere... would be nice if they had A/C or at least big fans
