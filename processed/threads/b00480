5 #1 go to store for all things produce  their best savings are friday-sunday so that's really convenient avocados are always 3-6 for $1 few pounds of tomatoes $1 eggplant 1/1 at least they always have them ranch market never does everything we've tried here has been really fresh and lasts a long time I do wish they had better sized sweet potatoes for cooking but that problem applies to all stores around here great price on soy chorizo as well not the place to buy processed foods, ice cream or pizza if you cook from scratch you will save tons of money  We feed 3 people for a week on about $60 believe it or not and it never seems to be too crowded like the ranch market or el super
3 We stopped in here late one Saturday night to grab a couple of emergency ingredients that I needed to prepare the dish that I was taking to a luncheon the next day.      As we were walking in I noticed a young, smartly dressed Hispanic guy standing out front of the store with a gaggle of young ladies in tight dresses.  It was late at night on a Saturday and I didn't think too much about it.  Inside the store I noticed that it was clean and well organized.  We were able to find the ingredients that we needed right away, and at a reasonable price and checked out without any wait.  The clerk that checked us out was friendly too.    We walked back to our car in the parking lot and after we climb in my husband says in a disgusted tone under his breath that he can't believe that the store management allows that to happen right in front of the store.  Being slightly buzzed from a few drinks earlier in the night I'm not sure I understood what he meant so I said "huh?" and he explains exactly what he means to me....  In incredulous shock I look back across the parking lot at where they are standing and look again.  Sure enough I now understand what he means; it was clear as day on second glance.     So, I guess if you are shopping for more than just groceries at 11 PM on a weekend this is the place to come.  :/
1 So on regular basis I stop by the Food City On McDowell rd and get a Burrito during my  Sat morning shop it's usually pretty tasty Very reasonably priced . My burrito today Was suppose to be Carnitas and potato The person making it also recited back what I ordered And maybe I spoke to fast  Or something but I ended up with a bean and potato burrito... And some Sour rice pudding I'm disappointed ... American  Based businesses go to great lengths to  Accommodate Spanish  speaking  people Can we at least get a English understanding employee that takes our  Orders ....
2 I went yesterday for their fried chicken for 6.99. Good price right? Wrong! Chicken was dried out, and hard. Definitely going to KFC or churches chicken next time! But deli lady was nice:-)  only plus side!
4 This place is awesome for all your Mexican food needs. The store carries limited selection so if your looking for something that you can find at your local grocery store it might not be here.  I recently made a batch of strawberry tamales and found everything I needed except for the strawberries. Hehe.  As I was very limited on time it was awesome that I found remade unseasoned masa por tamales.  This place has great prices for all their products. I love getting their preseasoned carne asada and tres leches for dessert.
1 The Deli area customer service  Needs some training twice now I have had issues one of the  Ladies doesn't understand English U ask for one thing and its wrong  Most if the time it's fine almost  Comedic but when you just want  A couple pieces of chicken and  The employee is like I can not Sell just two pieces to you I'm like  Really there's no one behind me  Ordering it or anything for that matter I went to Ranch Market!!!!!
