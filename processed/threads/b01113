5 I have bought the cutest handbags, shoes and jewelry in this fabulous boutique.  They have always been friendly to me; even when I've come in ultra-casual with no makeup.  Also, they always tell me ahead about upcoming great sales.
5 I love Nouvelle Armoire! It is a wonderful little shop that reminds me of the boutiques tucked along the streets of Lake Como Italy.  It is so pleasant to walk into the very european like shop where you can find a reasonable  little t shirt or splurge on  a unique dress from London. Somehow , in this mass market we all live in , the staff is able to keep the clothing special and uniquely your own!
5 My wife and I stropped there and my wife didn't want to leave - she loved TOO much of what was there.
