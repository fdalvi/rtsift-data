5 This place is delicious! This family owned restaurant is new in Las Vegas, but I can tell already its going to do great. Fresh seafood, very tasty and the portions were just right. We will definitely come back!

5 Best sea food I've ever tasted!!! Staff is very friendly and love the way they make the food fresh!!! Highly recommended!!!
5 Para los conocedores del sabor veracruzano, no hay mejor lugar que el camarón jarocho, sobre todo el cocktail de camarones y las picadas ( antojito típico de Veracruz ).  Como sugerencia, faltan meseros y un poquito más rápido el servicio.
