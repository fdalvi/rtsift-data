4 We don't normally shop for our dogs in designer doggie stores, but something compelled us to go into See Spot Shop.  Perhaps it was the two adorable and well-behaved golden retrievers who spied us from the parking lot who invited us in.  There is nothing pretentious about this store.  The owner is friendly and knowledgeable.  We were looking for something specifically for our dogs that are natural and odorless and they could chew on for a long time.  The owner directed us to the antler dog chews.  I was a bit skeptical, but we brought two home.  Our dogs, who usually abandon all other chews like Nylabones and such, got their paws and teeth on these and wouldn't let go!  They are a little expensive, I thought, but realized later that they could get hours, days, weeks on one antler and be satisfied.  Still, I had to check out the internet prices, and I was so pleased to see that See Spot Shop didn't mark up very much for these incredible treats and that in fact, her antlers sizes were heftier compared to what you get on line for the price.  We are very happy having found this little shop at the Summit in Scottsdale, and we will be frequent visitors.  And it's really cute to see that the two goldens get paid a commission of treats with every customer purchase.
5 This is a nice, small local shop that carries some high quality dog food. The have frozen, raw dog food, too.   They have some real fancy clothes for tiny dogs. I bought some awesome hiking shoes for my larger sized dogs here a few years ago- Ruffwear.   The location is very convenient if you live in the Cave Creek area. It's near Safeway and Target, so it's easy to combine shopping trips.   Parking is usually available close to the store, although for a huge parking lot it often has surprisingly few open spaces!
5 The girls that work there are so nice and helped me find food for my sick cat and neighbors.
