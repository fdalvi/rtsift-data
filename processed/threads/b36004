5 Republic West Remodeling recently did a renovation of the master bathroom in our home. After the death of my father, my mother came to live with us. She has some physical issues, and we needed to create a handicap accessible bathroom for her.  I felt this would be a challenging project, but the team at Republic West Remodeling were amazing. From the the initial design process, to picking out fixtures and materials, to the actual construction, the Republic West team walked us through each step and let us know what to expect. We had a detailed schedule. We knew who was coming to our home, and when. Every person who came to our home was professional and courteous. I have had nightmare experiences with other contractors in the past, but I can't say enough about my experience with Republic West Remodeling. The finished project is beautiful. The bathroom is fully ADA compliant. It is perfect for my mother's needs, but it still looks gorgeous. Republic West Remodeling did amazing work for our family, and I look forward to using them for our next project.
5 Republic West Remodeling did a great job on my back yard living space - they did a great job, and their professionalism is unmatched! Highly recommended!
