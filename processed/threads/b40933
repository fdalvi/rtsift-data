5 We had Aaron w/Desert Wolf come out and fix our heater/ac unit and install a new air handler and he did an amazing job! We previously had different companies come out and were very unhappy until we called Desert Wolf!  He was very knowledgeable, informative, honest and was willing to answer all of my questions (which were many, and didnt seem annoyed or rushed like the other companies.He showed that he cared and made sure we were happy! One thing that I was really impressed with, was that he took his time to do a good job and didn't rush! Great price and great service!! I will definitely only call Desert Wolf in the future!!
5 Desert Wolf was recommend to me  by East Valley Appliance Repair. I had 3 companies out to get my air working working properly and all failed. Desert Wolf got it right and for a reasonable price. Aaron showed me everything that had to be done and told me why. I highly recommend Desert Wolf.
5 If you are looking for someone that is reliable and honest this is your guy.  I needed to get a mini split installed - he told me exactly what he was going to do and how much it was going to cost.  It actually took a little longer to install than he had estimated, but the price did not change.  The last rip off AC guy I used charged by the hour, but I did not realize that until he tried to give me a massive bill.  You will not be sorry for calling Desert Wolf!
