5 I am a small business with 3 employees and I do a fair amount of printing.  I have used cartridge world at Raintree and the 101 for past several years and think everyone else should.   You can't beat their prices or service.
5 Friendly, fast and reasonably priced.
5 John Fortunato is the owner (with his wife, I believe), and he's usually there. when he's not whoever has attended on me I would give an absolute A to.But John...      He goes out of his way to treat people well. In my experience, he identified a problem even asking me if I needed to bring in my printer (I didn't), but how awesome. He has gone above and beyond with me several times, even to the point where he put my best interests in front of his very own. \ If anyone out there is looking for great value, and like the feeling that you are a customer in the old fashioned sense-go there. If not go to Staples, Best Buy, or even Wal--Mart and get waited on by a Droid or simply someone with a sharp pointer-finger.    Oh yeah, I give JOHN and Cartridge World (Thunderbird Sq too). My highest recommendation. And THAT'S WHY HE HAS A TREMENDOUS FOLLOWING!! You even have 2 parking spaces reserved right in front, esp convenient if going there during busy lunchtime. In and out in 7 minutes! Bless his niceness, I can't get into these details, but he is a truly nice man...     Scott H
3 I've always used Cartridge World to replace my printer cartridges (just a normal HP60 printer). Until recently I have used a different location and had always great service. My most recent purchase was at the location here on Pima where I got my regular black and color cartridges. The gentleman that helped me was very friendly, and told me that the cartridges were guaranteed and should I encounter any problems to just bring the cartridge back. Well I got home and the black cartridge worked fine - when I inserted the color cartridge the printer showed an error message saying that there was a problem with the cartridge - so I bring the cartridge back for a replacement. This was probably 2 weeks later that I got around to doing so, the cartridge wasn't even in my printer I just put it back in the clip and set it aside until I could bring it back. When I returned, a different man helped me - he weighed my cartridge and proceeded to tell me that I had used half of the ink. I explained to him that that was impossible because it wouldn't even allow me to do anything if it was in my printer. He made a face at me as if I were lying to him - really? I'm going to use half of a 15 dollar cartridge and bring it back for more? Then he says "I didn't even know you could print with a single cartridge in that printer." as if I again, was making something up. I assured him you can print in single-cartridge mode. Needless to say I eventually got a new cartridge - he showed me the weight of the cartridges written on the side from when they are filled and then showed me that mine weighed less. He then proceeded to show me a brand new cartridge and weighed that and get this THAT ONE DIDN'T EVEN WEIGH THE SAME. So he tells me that maybe if it is missing a color it will give an error. I ended up taking my new cartridge (which works now), and at the very least won't be coming to this location anymore. If you're going to guarantee your product, don't be a jerk when people bring it back - maybe test these cartridges once before handing them out.
5 This location is awesome. They always are super helpful and once even gave me trouble shooting tips over the phone to empty our company printers "waste toner" (don't worry, I didn't know what that was either)They are friendly, cost efficient and they deliver.
