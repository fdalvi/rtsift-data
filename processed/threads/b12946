4 Don't go into Party America if you (and those you share your life with) won't be OK with you bringing home a rainbow clown wig, neon green St. Patrick's Day hats, plastic Sponge Bob tableware, 1000 Mardi Gras beads, and 10 pounds of assorted hard candies. But if this sounds like your idea of fun, then Party America is the place for you. Maybe I'll see you there...
1 Party America is no longer open. The landlord has seized the property with everything inside and it hasn't shown signs of reopening since January 2012. Wish I'd known that before making the trek out to Chandler.
2 Party America is back open again and they have been having this 'Clearance/Store Closing' sign up in their window for awhile but each time we would try to go they were closed. So apparently they close early, come earlier.   We finally were able to make it, but most of the store was taped off. A few aisles with mundane stuff we weren't interested in were on clearance so that was a bust. They were starting to put out more Halloween items so I guess they are going out of business but staying in business until after the Halloween season. Hopefully I can go back when they have put more stuff out.
