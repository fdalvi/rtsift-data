5 The staff here is friendly and efficient.  They literally take care of everything for you when it comes to packaging your items and getting them sent off!  This will definitely be my go to place from now on for all of my shipping needs.
5 I work next door to here...Howard (the owner i believe) is awesome !!!  Not only do I take all our business needs there I also take my personal.   He is fair, friendly and literally does it all for you.  I will always go here for my and my works shipping and general office needs
5 I've been coming here for over 2 years now. Howard and Chris are so nice and helpful, even when I stop by just to mail things and don't buy anything they actually make $ from! When I do have them pack and ship things for me, they do a great job packing everything carefully, and I can trust them that it will get sealed up and sent out on time. I've sent some very big, expensive shipments with them and they've never let me down! They also do great printing and binding. Highly recommended!! =)
5 Great service, low prices compared to other places nearby.  anything requiring more than a stamp on a regular envelope I take to Safe Ship. Actually, I usually drop my stamped mail there as well since they are a US Postal Serviceâ„¢ Approved Shipper.
5 I keep telling them every time I go there they are the best but they don't believe me ..  Great people. Excellent service..
