3 It's never a good sign when your reviews entirely contradict the previous... wait, those were like 3 years ago. Phew. Good to know. No idea what the place was like 3 years ago but it was a pleasant enough visit in 2014. I wouldn't be lusting after another visit, but certainly not the miserable experience noted as previous.   We had soup (cullen skink and tomato & lentil) - what looked to be smallish bowls turned out to be the Mary Poppins of bowls - this soup seemed to grow and was crazy filling, yo. Cullen skink so fresh it had some leftover bones (added flavour) although quite salty, even by my salt-encrusted standards. Tomato and lentil was well received and didn't require further seasoning either. Scones were presented warmed through with jam and butter, and pretty tasty. Didn't feel shop bought either (or look it). We also got sandwiches, but they left with us too, for later, as soup and a sandwich here was just too much. Would note the sandwich options aren't super exciting, and some more appealing options were available in the 12.95 two course menu... but I was reluctant to pay 8 quid for a salad when it didn't seem much different in content to the Â£4.50 sandwiches (salmon and prawn salad with toast versus a salmon salad sandwich...).   All pleasant enough and certainly not the disappointment (kitchens also clean on our visit too).   Cash preferred, credit cards under 10 come at a supplementary cost.
