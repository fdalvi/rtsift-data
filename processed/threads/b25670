5 After going to a different urgent care and actually getting worse, a friend recommended this one, which is practically next door to me, so score one for location.  Staff is super friendly and professional and there wasn't a long wait at all.  The Doctor was awesome, really spent some time getting to hear what was really going on, making the diagnosis and getting me the treatments I needed.    While I hope I don't need them often, this will now be the ONLY urgent care I go to.
5 I was thrilled when this location opened as it is very close to my home. Having been to other urgent care facilities and being treated like cattle by annoyed office staff who looked like they were barely out of high school - I was impressed by the cleanliness of the office, friendliness of the staff and expertise of the providers.   I have been here three times in the past six months both for myself and with family members. I was thrilled to get in and out in less than one hour on a Saturday morning for a somewhat complex issue that required a couple of tests!  Also, after my husband went in for a wound dressing, the office called him the next day to check and see how he was doing...my GP doesn't even do that anymore!  Urgent Care Extra truly understands that healthcare is becoming more consumer-driven and knows we have a choice in where we take our business. They have earned my business!
5 Quick, easy and I love that they have a pharmacy in house.
5 I just moved here from Las Vegas and don't have insurance right now. I came in for a strain from moving and there was ZERO wait, the cost was more than reasonable and the staff was amazingly nice and helpful. I never had service like this in Nevada....ever! The facility is immaculate also. Finally, they even fill CHEAP prescriptions on site! What more could you ask?
5 This is the first time I've ever been to urgent care, let alone this one. I thought that this was the best considering my other doctor visits elsewhere. The place did not open till 8, but they let me come in and sit down until they opened. Which was really nice. They were very accommodating and knew what they were talking about. I had brought my mom and my sister and they even gave my sister a cookie while I had a X-ray done because she wanted to come with me, but she could not.
5 Very friendly and I did not have to wait long. I like the in house pharmacy. I would definitely recommend to anyone
1 I have been to this UC twice for my son.. the first time was not that great. The 2nd time I took him was because my primary care couldn't get him in that day... He was misdiagnosed and given meds that I said don't usually work on him... There were no tests actually done on him, they said he had an upper respiratory infection. I told them he had been throwing up and what can we do to stop it.. they ignored that. A day later I had to take my son to Emergency room, he actually had a strain of the Flu and needed to have different medication and be hydrated from the vomiting.   I never write reviews but I do read them, but I will never go there again. Being a single mom I thought it important to share with others my experience as it has to do with health and my child.
1 Shady, shady, shady! I walked in with a cold and before I even had the chance to see a doctor or get a possible diagnosis, they tried to force a chest x-ray on me! Will be the last time I come here or refer anyone!
1 This urgent care unfortunately just lost a family of four who are very loyal to their medical providers.  Great service initially when I went in a week ago with a broken nose, but called ahead today to have them get x-ray burned on to a CD because they said they didn't have the ability to forward x-ray to my ENT and North Scottsdale.  Left work and drove 40 minutes one (because they said it would be ready for me) to pick up CD to take into my appointment today and got there and then was told their machine to burn CDs has been down all day. Wasted an hour and a half of driving when they could've told me I couldn't get it today, which would've been fine.  Do not like writing negative reviews at all, but feel people should know in case they're looking for great customer service with their experience.
5 I just moved to the area and haven't found a GP yet. I've had to go to this Urgent Care for two different, very painful conditions. Each time, the wait was short, the staff was courteous, and the second time they referred me to specialists to help me beyond what they could. Definitely go if you aren't feeling well!
5 This was our first time here. The staff was super friendly, the wait time was great, the provider who saw us explained what was wrong and what he was going to prescribe to help. Within minutes an ma came in after he was done talking to us, prescriptions already filled (so nice when dealing with a double ear infection to not have to also go wait at a pharmacy!), she walked us to check out, we paid for our prescriptions and were on our way! They were so friendly we talked about just making them our primary care since they can treat so much right there! If you are close and need an urgent care I would highly recommend this one!!
