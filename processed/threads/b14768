4 Been shopping here ever since moving into the neighborhood in 1996, love everything in the store.  The veggies and fruits are always so fresh, and the bakery goodies are as good as any other privately owned bakery shops.  One thing that I am not a fan of this store is that there is never a good cell reception once you entered the store, but other than that, this is as good as it gets.  All the employees and managers are so friendly, if you saw anything that needs to be corrected, make sure you tell someone and they will usually fix it right away or make sure it gets fixed the next day.  I would definitely recommend this store to anyone that just move into the neighborhood.
1 Apparently they haven't any naval oranges! When I called and asked the "produce guy" about it, he wasn't even sure if it was company wide or if there was a problem.... Not very helpful at all!!
