4 I do love Taco Bell and this location is no exception. Usually a little bit slower than the others as it is still newer. Service is about as fast as the location behind Target Greatland on Buffalo.
2 What happened to Taco Bell?  It use to be one of my favorite Guilty Pleasures....it has fallen so far down my list, I don't even crave it anymore.  Why?  - Because their portions are much smaller.  - Prices increased.  - Quality of the food downhill.  My most recent visit the other day I ordered a 7 Layer Burrito ($1.99) and 2 Bean Burritos ($1.09).  The Bean Burritos were the size of the ones they sold a few years ago for 69 cents....now they're $1.09?  They're freakin' tiny and unsatisfying.  The 7 Layer Burrito has taken a huge hit in quality too.....all of the ingredients tasted bland.....blech.  Also, Taco Bell has the habit of not putting out their Fire Sauce for people to use....only Hot & Mild.....and when you ask for some, they give you 2 packets for each item.  I can easily use up 4 or 5 per item....whatever.  Overall Value - Even though I spent less than $5, it was garbage.  Only reason why I stopped by was because of old memories of good junk food.  Will I return?  Eventually, someday.....but not anytime soon.
3 Near my home,always polite,prompt service and I usually have a sister wife & family spotting here! I wish they'd carry brewed ice tea and dr pepper!
2 First time at this particular location, but you would think since it's a chain they would all be the same...boy was I wrong. I order nacho supreme and a Mexican pizza. The nachos barely had any meat or beans on them and the shell for the Mexican pizza tasted of old oil and stale. So awful!!!
