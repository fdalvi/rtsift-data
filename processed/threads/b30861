3 Quite a lovely wee café tucked in the West End Village, and as the Yelp ratings put it 'A-OK'.  It's home-grown and feels unique, which I like. However, this uniqueness does include very odd heighted tables and chairs which I couldn't quite relax into, and which I noted all other customers also perched at odd angles in. It didn't ruin my tea experience, but I do wonder what their logic was for that.  Petite in size, and I know not a fault of the café, but whilst I was there two different families with small children came in. Loud, banging happy baby was replaced by crying hungry baby. In such a small place this didn't really help catching up with Cheryl C. So it may be a place that yummy mummys / cry-y babies go during the week.   The cakes looked delicious, although I didn't try one (I'm being good!) Teapigs tea, nice. Sandwiches looked tasty too.  Slightly off the main street, on William Street, but definitely a nice wee spot. If the seats were at a more convenient height and there were less children, the rest of the ambience would be perfect for an hour alone with a book.
2 This place is overrated. I will admit its like 3.30 but where's the homebaking?? I liked this place on FB a while ago after reading about how great it is so i get regular updates on what they're baking for the day. Batches of scones, brownies and loaf cakes. It's been on my 'must try' list for a while. So... I trek over town on my day off for a relaxing tea and cake and.... NO CAKE!!! Harrumph! :(  The place is weird, seats uncomfortable and it looks like rabid dogs (or children*) have had a fight over over a scone by the looks of all the crumbs and raisins all over the floor (now stuck to the bottom of my Kenneth Cole handbag!). The floor is grubby and the tables dirty. I feel conned.   In huff.  * obv the children wouldn't be rabid. Maybe ;)
5 Amazingly good coffee best I had in Edinburgh. Friendly and polite staff, small cafe with a limited menu. Highly recommended for breakfast
