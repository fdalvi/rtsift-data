5 I brought 2 of my kids here and they had a great visit!
5 A few years ago, I had a horrible eye infection and no insurance. I called around to find an office that would charge me reasonably and came across Dr. Ornstein's office in Surprise, AZ. The front office staff informed the Dr. and they offered me what I considered a reasonable price up front.   When I saw Dr. Ornstein, he was very professional and kind and treated my eye condition quickly as I was healed within a few days. He did tell me to return in 2 weeks for a follow up, and I explained to him that I couldn't easily do that --since I had no insurance. Dr. Ornstein was so kind, he told his staff to add me to the schedule in 2 weeks and to not charge me.    CARING EYE DOCTOR!
5 Dr, Ornstein and his staff have been taking care of my family for four years, and the service is top-notch.  Most importantly, Dr. O is patient, helpful, and friendly.  He has gone out of his way on more than one occasion, even seeing me on a weekend for an eye emergency.  He's the kind of doctor that genuinely cares about his patients, and I can honestly say that he and his staff are some of the best at what they do.
5 I just moved here from Tucson and was in desperate need of new contacts/glasses.  I saw the great Yelp reviews for Surprise Eye care so I thought I'd give them a try.  I was very pleased with the professionalism and the attention to detail I received from Dr. Ornstein and his staff.  He is my new eye Dr. for sure!
