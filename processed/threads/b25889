5 Dr. Garick Ho's practice is located right next to Pho Chandler, in the Home Depot plaza.  I hesitated before making an appointment at All Brite Dental because it had no reviews/ratings on the web.  But, since I like to give business to fellow Asians and All Brite is in my vicinity, I decided to take a risk. The result is that I'm a very satisfied customer.  Dr. Garick Ho and his assistant Shelly performed a thorough cleaning. They were honest and sincere when making various recommendations. I'll be returning this dentist in six months.
5 Fantastic first visit for both my kids and me. The staff were all very professional. He's mor on the conservative side, which I appreciate since he's not recommending extensive and unnecessary work. Pricing is quite reasonable as well.
5 Honest dentists are hard to find. Dr. Ho takes his time with his patients and does not try and sell any overpriced gimmicks.
5 Ive been seeing Dr ho for almost two years now. Conservative, doesn't tell me I need laser cleaning or gum massages which would be $1000 more after insurance. Couple of teeth beginning to discolor, they could become cavities and I may want some work done, but not necessary (which is great because Ive had those discolorations from childhood and so far have not progressed to cavities). Any dentist who insists on work done immediately loses my business for being a money sucker.
5 Dr Ho is by far and away the best dentist! This is my 2nd time here (every 6mo). His cleaning is a deep - very very deep clean with the water tool. He is so unbelievably gentle and caring. The cleaning may "hurt" a bit but know that what he's doing as a normal cleaning, I used to have to pay extra at my old dentist. Teeth feel and look amazing. Thanks Dr Ho!!!!
