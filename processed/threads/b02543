1 Oh how we need negative stars available on here. Church's tastes nothing like it used to like I remember when I was younger. Went there a few weeks back and haven't returned and won't. Ordered chicken strips, fries and mac n cheese. That was a mistake. The chicken had a weird taste to it and the fries were soaked with what tasted like rancid cooking oil. The mac n cheese was runny and bland. I don't get why there are so many Church's locations. If anything there should be more Popeyes.
4 I've been eating at this Church's for many years now and have never had any issues with the service or the food.  They are always courteous and prompt when I place my order, especially since my orders are always large orders.  Their prices are on par with most fast food restaurants and unlike KFC, their chicken doesn't upset my stomach.  A little tip for ordering here, if you plan on placing a large order ($30+) call ahead and make them aware so they can have it ready when you arive.
3 It is a Church's Chicken. You get what you should expect. Greasy chicken, strawberry soda, and a constant flow of city characters that make us country folks a bit on edge. All in all, this is a great location so long as you do not expect too much.
4 Darned good chicken!   Unlike a previous reviewer I've had nothing but good experiences at Church's Chicken here in Mesa. When it gets too late to go anyplace else and I need something to eat Church's is close and easy and fast and cheap. Not only that but it tastes good. I usually prefer dark meat but sometimes I forget to tell them and get white meat, either way it's extremely moist and tender and juicy.  I've never gotten a bad batch with an unacceptable coating or meat.   The biscuits are so good I want to eat them like cookies! I've gotten a half gallon of the sweet tea for 2 bucks on sale in hot weather and it lasted me several days in my motel room.  I tried the Apple Turnover once and it was very good. This trip I've gotten the $2.99 special two different times that has a biscuit with 2 pieces of chicken, usually a thigh and leg but today I got a thigh and a breast.  It's a fast easy meal if it's too late to go to a restaurant and it keeps well in the motel fridge too. On past trips I've  sometimes stopped by and gotten 3 or 4 pieces just to keep in the refrigerator so that if I don't feel like going out to eat I've got something on hand.    Oh, and I went to Popeyes a few weeks ago expecting to get a good fried chicken and it was so horribly salty I couldn't eat it. Church's Chicken has never let me down.  Even the mashed potatoes and gravy weren't bad. They certainly weren't  overly salty even though I know they were made from a mix.  Now if I could just get Church's Chicken to open one near where I live in San Diego.....
5 WOW! The chicken I got from there was FANTASTIC! If you like crispy chicken, this is the place for you.  The biscuits we got were probably top 5 biscuits of all time.  They have honey on them. The location sucks but it is what it is.  I don't usually eat fried stuff because of my cholesterol but I would go back tomorrow if I could. Really good.
