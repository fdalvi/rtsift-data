5 Had a great time. Sat at the bar, Ryan and Rachel are awesome! Ask for them by name. Love the new look! I'll be here every week!!!!!!
5 Had lunch with the family here and love this location.   The food was great, service was excellent and loved the decor.  We usually go to the one at marketplace and have not been there much because of a few issues.   This will definitely be the place we go.  They were wonderful with the kids and not such a bar atmosphere, great family place you can still get a great happy hour!
5 This was our first time at this new location.  It is very nicely decorated and just starting to get busy on a Friday night.  The server we had was just outstanding and made our experience very pleasant.  She explained everything on the menu and really took her time to make us feel special.  I think her name was (sp??) Darnashia.   The food was just what you would want at a Red Robin.  We will be back!
1 Worst service ever. Where was the utensils, the bottomless fries, the refills? Food was good but waited 15 minutes for server to get order and another 20 minutes for bottomless fries.... Which I am still waiting for. Server is too busy helping others. Well Red Robin you have lost a customer! Mel was our waitress and she seriously needs more training. She was nice, but really needs to get her sh*t together as a server.
