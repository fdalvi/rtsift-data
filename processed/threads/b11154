5 I'm not a fan of the Krispy Kreme donut.  Not at all.  I like little donut shoppes operated by people and not machines with burnt sienna tables.  Al's is just that place.  It's been at its location on Maryland and Harmon for decades, and these puppies are made by hand.  The people who come in here are regulars and there's a reason: These doughnuts are simply better.  There's no shiny machine, they don't offer you paper hats, but my goodness do they fry up some delicious rings and bars and anything else you can imagine.
5 Being a Krispy Kreme for a while I was little skeptic of anything else (yeah .. like I ever tried anything else). KKs were matter of convenience since my office used to be next to Terrible's gas station. Then I took a year off "donut daily". Then not a long time ago I came across reviews in LV Weekly about local donut shops and voila there's one right down the street from my house: Al's.  Now I look at KKs like at poorly mass-produced product somewhere just above "Hostess" boxed stuff you can get in a grocery store.  Al's stuff is twice larger, twice tastier and twice fresher! And since I'm running few miles almost every morning - simple carbs go verrrrry well  (just finished 2 of them :)
5 I absolutely love these donuts.  I've been coming here for over ten years and the owners are the nicest people you'll ever meet.  Al's donuts is conveniently located right across the street from UNLV.  I'd highly recommend any of the bars or the cake donuts (they look a little small but are fillingly delicious).  All the donuts are way bigger than similar ones you'd get at Krispy Kremes and twice as tasty.    For those seeking to satisfy their donut cravings, Al's will really hit the spot.  If your in a rush they also have a drive through and take phone orders.  UPDATED* Oh for those on the west side, they are affiliated with Ronald's Donuts on Spring Mountain.  Turns out the owners are related, baking these tasty donuts apparently runs in the family
2 This is the first time Yelp has led me astray.  We got a variety of donuts and all of them were so so dry.  We ended up throwing them away.  I do appreciate that they stay open late.
5 Al keeps it simple, They only sell cigs and donuts. That gives Al plenty of time to put all of his love and these little delicacies. No wasted effort on croisanwiches and lattes, etc.   They're also open late which is great, so after the bar scene while your buddies are next door at Roberto's tempting their fate you can sneak over and indulge your sweet tooth.
4 I love small businesses because it is "The American Dream ". The idea of hardworking families that own their own businesses is great. This small place across from UNLV does have pretty good donuts. I paid $7.00 (tax included) for a dozen and each individual donut was pretty big. The selection was not that massive but they cover all the basics. I am pretty content with that. Every time I am in the UNLV area, I try my best to stop by Al's and support them in any way I can.
5 Very professional donuts.  I purchased and consumed 3 donuts: maple, crumb, and custard creme.    All were of highest donut quality.  Crumb and Creme were most outstanding and Al's are amongst the best of these species that I have sampled.  The custard was flavorful and tasted much more REAL than any other creme filled I have tried recently.  The crumb was deliciousness through and through, with hints of coconut.
4 Al Donut's were scrumptious! I stopped by on my way to work this morning. They didn't have a ton to choose from as it was already nearer to 8am. But I did notice some of the  donuts were LARGE!   The woman working the counter was very friendly. I chose a chocolate cake donut with chocolate frosting and it was yummy. For 80 cents, you can't beat it.  A small shop, with hand written signs in the window. It has seating inside if one chooses to eat there.  It was nice to support a local business instead of one of those larger chains who all taste the same!  Try it some time!
4 Great donuts at affordable prices.  I have to say that I enjoy this donut shop more than Ronald's!  Their donuts are fluffy, creamy, and they melt in your mouth.  I love old mom & pop places like this one.  it's cash only, so bring at least 8 bucks for the $7 dozen and a few special donuts, too.
4 I have driven by this place for years but just recently went in for the first time to grab a donut and croissant. All I can say is... it's pretty darn tasty. Personally, this is the only donut shop in town that I know of that is not a Krispy Kreme or something like that. This is your standard old fashion donut shop with bear claws, maple bars, cake donuts with sprinkles etc....   No more of this fancy donut business for me! Yay for Al's!   Oh and they are across from UNLV which makes it great for me to stop by on may way into morning classes.
5 Yum yum yum! Al's Donuts is delish! These donuts are sooo much better than getting the same old dunkin' donuts crap. They definitely have that homemade taste that chain donut companies really lack. They are very fresh and just down right amazing. Try them!
5 Little gem of a donut shop right across the street from UNLV hidden behind the 7-11.  Nothing fancy from the outside but the donuts here were so fresh and delicious it made me melt.  I ordered the maple bar and a cake with sprinkles.  The cake donut tasted almost crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  Very nice friendly owner, cheap prices, quality product.  I will be back next time i'm craving donuts!
5 Great doughnuts good price not a chain give him a chance
4 Four stars is defined by Yelp as "Yay! I'm a fan." which is completely agreeable. While not exactly a donut connoisseur, I hunt down the best local donut shops immediately upon my arrival to a new town (I move around a bit), so I've had quite a few donuts from quite a few shops from quite a few states.   I picked up a half dozen yesterday afternoon (just shy of $6 for anyone curious about price) and was pleased with the selection available. A couple hours and a couple donuts later (twist and chocolate glazed), I concluded that these will do in a pinch, and certainly surpass the grocery, convenience store, and dunkin/krispy alternatives.   So why not 5 stars? Staleness. While still tasty and edible, they had lost the fresh, soft, doughy yumminess that separates the 'good' from the 'best'. And with that said, my hunt continues...
5 went to Al's donuts it was awsome had a great time with my girl . It was Like a classic donut shop crazy good donuts and phillys where the best in vegas . But what i had was new the guy was telling me it was a ice cream sundae donut it was the best i ever had . I need to go back because they have breakfast donuts with bacon eggs and cheese how awsome
3 There's really no point of having donuts if you don't get them fresh and hot when they first open.  I got here around 1:30pm on a Friday, so the donut selection was depleted and softish-hard.  To me, it tasted like any other donut.  UPDATE: Okay, I was in the area, so I gave it another try.  Had a Bavarian cream chocolate donut.  It was pretty good and since they were about to close, I got it for half off.  Can't complain there.
3 Went here back in may 2011... Pretty damn good donuts, reminds me of a donut shop that used to be open in my old stomping grounds. selection was limited at the time i went here but the 4 kinds i had were awesome. will return when im like 40 ... if ever
3 Nothing spectacular here.  We were in about 10:00am and the glazed donut was fresh, but the flavored donut (i've since forgotten the flavor) tasted a bit old.  We were in and out in less than 5 minutes.   I wouldn't go out of my way to return.
4 I do enjoy stumbling upon local mom-n-pop shops, especially when they're good!  This donut shop is a mere hop, skip, and a jump from my office at UNLV, which means too much sugary temptation during the afternoon slump.  I bought a couple of chocolate iced and vanilla iced donuts -- with sprinkles! -- and the first bites revealed pure yumminess.  The girl behind the counter said that those were the freshest.  They were!  Donuts are under a dollar each, which makes it easy on the budget when you're craving a sugary something or other.  I'm sure the offerings are even better first thing in the morning, when a lot of the donuts are made.  In addition to donuts, one can purchase sandwiches here! (?)  I'll think about trying one of those next time.  Al's Donuts is located behind the 7-11, a few doors down from Roberto's Taco Shop.
4 Sometimes all a person needs after a difficult gym session is a donut. When that craving takes over, I am not one to turn it down. Instead of going to the big chains, I used the Yelp application to help me find a locally own, small mom and pop type shop. Instead of going to my go to apple fritter, I opted for the chocolate glazed buttermilk donut and a regular chocolate glaze.   I waited to consume them until I walked across to UNLV. Maybe I could give one to my friend and not completely sabotage all my hard work. The longer they sat in my hands, the more I regretted buying them. By the time I sat down, I was dreading my next workout. When I finally broke into the chocolate buttermilk, I was puzzled. It gave way too easily. Then I bite into it and it reminded me of an angel food cake. What the hell was this? The taste of such a decadent treat comes in such a deceiving package. I am not angry that it was not the normal dense cake. Instead I am more angry with how fast I devoured the thing. There was not even an ounce of remorse and no heavy sinking brick lining my stomach. The first was so good, that I could only share half of the second donut. The regular chocolate glaze was fluffy but greasy.
4 Great ham&cheese croissants! Very economical in comparison to the coffee bean, einstein bagels, & Starbucks down the street. If it was open later I would give this place 5 stars.
5 My grandparents have been taking me to Al's since I was a little girl. This place hasn't changed at all (no matter the change in management) and that's why I love it so much. The donuts are excellent, not that nasty sugary Crispy Creme crap... REAL donuts. Al's is exactly how donuts should taste and the price is beyond right. I come here whenever I can for nostalgia and for an excellent chocolate icing donut.
5 An old school, classic donut shop in the desert.  Big thumbs up.  If you're not originally from Vegas and grew up some place like Chicago or Houston, you probably remember a shop like Al's Donuts from when you grew up.  A family-run donut place with all the classic donuts (chocolate raised, cake, blueberry, cruller, etc), some generic but warm coffee, juice choices, and folks stopping in on their way to work to grab a dozen donuts.  In that way, Al's Donuts tastes like a little bit of history -- not fancy, just simple and well-done.  Al's does a great job with its pastries. The donuts are homemade and fried on spot.  They're not overly sugary (like Krispy Kreme) and not smooth to the touch (like Dunkin Donuts).  Instead, you can feel the rough texture that came from the fryer and the fried taste comes along with the chocolate and sugar to produce an excellent taste.  Not a simply sweetness upon sweetness, but a combination of fried dough and sweet.  I'm a huge fan.    And the customer service is great.  The guy who owns the place can normally be found working.  And he offers some great suggestions and will offer a taste test or two if you're interested.
4 Came in on the way to school and grabbed 3 dozen donuts for my classmates.  The gentleman behind the counter was really friendly and stuffed the boxes to the brim with a wonderful mix of donuts.  He explained the different kinds they had, all of which sounded absolutely delicious!  I noticed he was putting a few more than 12 in each box, to which he replied that he likes to throw in a few extra when people are ordering by the dozen.  Hey, the more donuts the merrier!  I had the apple pie doughnut.  It was a huge brown doughnut stuffed with yummy apple pie filling sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon.  It was surprisingly light and not overly sweet.  I didn't make it to try any of the other donuts as this one was super filling.  I received good feedback from my classmates about the other types of donuts.  If I was around the area and craving donuts, I'd go back to Al's to get my fix.
5 Al's has the best fresh donuts. Very friendly staff that make you feel welcome. The donuts are fresh and awesome. The sandwiches are wicked good. Always fast friendly service from their great staff.
4 The person behind the counter is so nice...he was really helpful.  They have the biggest glazed donut I have ever seen, which is only $1.5!  I unfortunately did not order the crullers :( But I did love their maple glazed!  My friend liked this place too!  Will come back for their crullers next time.
4 Al's is the kind of place we need more of, and is a good example of why you should support local small businesses.  It's a no frills classic donut joint.  I had the large apple fritter, which was most certainly large and packed with flavor.  I was also fortunate to arrive when the bacon maple donuts were being finished, so they were still warm.  Fresh, warm donuts are like another type of food entirely from room temperature donuts.  The bacon maple donut has become insanely popular at nearly every place, but this is a very strong version.  The donut was crispy and airy at the same time, and it had a lot of bacon on the top.  My only complaint, and it's slight, would be a little more of the maple frosting.  But, like I said, this is a minor complaint.  Overall, a friendly owner and a fantastic breakfast.  Skip Dunkin and come here..
4 I stopped by after work on a Sunday morning.  They are open 7 days a week and make Cronuts 7 days a week.  They were located on E Harmon Ave/S Maryland Parkway Blvd in The Promenade across from UNLV in Las Vegas.  My first time eating a cronut!  Part croissant and part donut.  Yum!  They have been making them for about 3 months.  They had 2 different cronuts to choose from, although the flavors vary each day.  I ordered 3 Chocolate Peanut cronuts and 3 Maple Bacon cronuts.  I had them filled with Bavarian cream.  I will be back.
5 Stopped in an Al's instead of Ronald's just to try something different and daaaaammmmn it was soooo worth it!  James, the chef that makes all the donuts takes ultimate pride in everything he serves.  The donuts do not stay out for more than 2 hours, or he considers them "old".  Say what??  The yeast donuts are light, fluffy and melt in your mouth.  Even the cake donuts are light and moist (I'd highly recommend the chocolate or blueberry).  One last thing, they have cronuts!  Yup.  The same ones that people wait miles in line in New York for.  Granted, I have never had a cronut from NY, but the one I ate at Al's can be described as simply sinful!  Light, airy, tasty, morsels of fried goodness with a slight chew to it.  James, if you are reading this, you are the man!  If you like Ronald's, you will love Al's!
2 Finding a donut shop in Vegas on a Friday at 9/10pm is tough! I found 2-3 Krispy Kremes on Yelp. When I drove to the address, however, there was no Krispy Kreme. I used Yelp to try to get to a different donut shop, which listed it as being open on Yelp until 11pm. I'll blame that on the person who created the entry. Finally I found Al's, right across the UNLV campus. Donuts were alright. Nothing over the top or memorable. They were just open, and I was tired of trying to chase the "best" donut shop in town.
5 Best donut shop in town! Hand made, consistently tasty!
5 Best ever!! Can't eat one. Soooo much better than frozen crapolla from krunkin'. dunkin'
2 Very poor.  Bavarian cream tasted like old oil. Cinnamon roll was ok.  3.25 for two items is way too high.
3 Only place in vegas that I had half decent Cronuts.   Tried the maple with bacon and chocolate with peanuts. Light cream filling, with a flakey-ish outside.   Maybe they are better when they are fresh.
4 Itty Bitty Al's Donuts Review: - After dinner last Thursday with the family, Dad said he wanted donuts for breakfast the next day. - Yelp app to the rescue!  Al's Donuts was just down the street. Never knew it was so close to UNLV. - Arrived around 8:00pm and a fresh batch of glazed was just coming out of the oven. - Spied cronuts in the case!  Half a dozen glazed to go is all we got, though. - Dad loved them and said they still tasted good two days later.  He and Mom take a while to eat donuts.  There's nothing like the classic and simple glazed--delicious! - I'll be back to try the cronuts.
2 Absolutely disgusting!  Went there for cronut because I had heard rave reviews and wanted to try one.  It was nice and crispy on the outside but raw dough in the middle!  I had also bought a maple bar and apple fritter.  The fritter, again, raw dough in the middle and with it as well as the maple bar-tasted like old oil.   Needless to say, I wasted $7!  $5.85 and &1.15 tip.  I have popped in there before and bought a rainbow sprinkle donut...it was very good that time.  Don't think I'll be going back as I read a review on Yelp that stated the same thing about the oil...so it must be an ongoing, (albeit, not always) problem.  I don't want to show up on a day that they have reused the oil over and over again.  Once, shame on them-twice, shame on me.
3 Good donuts. Make sure you get a receipt though, I got charged $9.95 for something that was under $6.
2 Items selected:  Maple Bacon Krossant with Bavarian Cream Strawberry Krossant with Raspberry Filling Raised Glazed Vanilla Sprinkle Glazed Apple Fitter Buttermilk Bar  A mom n' pop spot now dabbling in the bourgeoning cronut (or, in this case, Krossant) market Al's Donuts has been serving Las Vegas since the 1970s and although perhaps not as well-known as Ronald's the shop proved a very convenient stop on a Saturday morning prior to a tour of my new workplace and more real estate shopping.  A rather small space with a decent selection of classics cake and yeasted donuts plus fritters, cinnamon rolls, and the aforementioned novelties my eventual order entailed a half dozen selections and taking them to enjoy with a friend the results were as mixed as the selections.  Beginning first with the raised options, my pal's preferred variety, both of us felt that the texture of Al's were far less fluffy than necessary - likely the result of over-kneading the dough - and moving onward to my personal choices of a buttermilk bar and a tiny apple fritter the results were better, but still not on par with Ronald's, Coco, Pink Box, or Friendly Donut House.  Hoping for the 'krossants' to save the day I will admit that both versions featured an excellent crunch with good lamination and separation of the interior layers, but with a relative dearth of filling the flavor was largely lost once past the glaze - though the strawberry glaze was admittedly quite excellent.
2 Disappointed.  The cronuts are dry and lack of flavors.  Sadly to say i enjoy some franchised shop products more than stuffs i got from here.
4 The Kronuts are to die for! I suppose I could give this one more star but it's just your average neighborhood donut shop; nothing fancy. The staff is friendly, and the donuts are amazing!   Kronut- croissant-doughnut hybrid
4 I live in the area and didn't really pay much attention to Al's. Prior to this year, I only had their donuts once which were pretty good from what I remember. But just like everyone else I came here for the cronuts! It's nice to see a mom and pop shop keeping up with the trends, let alone in my neighborhood! Om nom nom nom is the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Al's cronuts. Yesterday I went at 8:30am and they were already out, so I suggest you come here before 8!! I was really disappointed because the employee in the front did ask the kitchen staff to see what was going on in the back and he came back saying no cronuts. Thanks for the effort though! The 2 times I was able to get my hands on them was at 7am and 7:15am so I guess they go pretty fast. I think they make batches periodically throughout the day to keep them fresh. So far I've tried the strawberry and the raspberry cronuts. The strawberry was honestly nothing special, but I absolutely loved the raspberry!!! Maybe because the raspberry had a glaze on top unlike strawberry one. People here are giving Al's bad reviews, you kidding me?! Take it from me and try the raspberry and your intuition to venture for the cronut will be fulfilled! The inside is definitely old school mom and pop donut shop feel, possibly needing a make over/renovations? Oh well I just come in and leave right away anyway so it doesn't really matter to me.
5 Al's I will never forget you because you gave me my first taste of flake taste cronut! I will I will stalk you every time I'm in Vegas so you better have those cronuts ready! The sweety young lady behind the counter was so help because I didn't no anything about cronuts ! If you never had one before I suggest you get your butt down to Al's and try 1 or 2 for yourself !!
5 Today after I ate these I had a sugar seizure. Doughnuts have got to be the single worst breakfast food ever conceived! But empty calories are delicious. Hate yourself, not the doughnut.  I don't really understand all of the complexities of doughnuts so I choose Al's because going Krispy Kreme seems so corporate and unfashionable. Whenever I have a chance to stick it to the man, I'll do it.  The place was friendly and not hard to find. I got co-worker doughnuts and everyone said they were better than Krispy Kreme which I assume is true because I have not been to Krispy Kreme since like 2008. Not big on doughnuts, people but also not hot for "big doughnut".  A lot of other people seem to be focusing on the negatives of getting doughnuts at Al's so let me share my personal negative thoughts on the place:  The box they came in was super annoying. Brown instead of pink, can you imagine!?  The price was so low I couldn't even guilt trip people about how I spent tons of cash getting doughnuts for them. Way to take the fun out of giving!  The didn't have any diet doughnuts OR any baby panda doughnuts, caviar doughnuts or any other rich person type flavors that would show off my classy status. Aaaaaaaaand, I'm being sarcastic....  I guess I don't have high standards for doughnuts. However, I think a small business deserves a shot over a corporate chain. Down with big doughnut!
3 So I think it's hard for me to write rave reviews for sweets since I prefer the savory.  Pulling up, this is the typical looking hole in the wall donut shop.  The interior looks similar to something I saw in the 1980's growing up.  We went after lunch and unfortunately most of their popular krossants were already gone =(.  We did try the powdered sugar jelly filled krossants and they were okay, but then again I think all donuts are just okay.  They also only had mini krossants, which was fine by me since I took my donut to Snowflake Shavery to consume anyways.  I'm guessing bright and early is the time to come for this place, after lunch there were slim pickings.
4 I have to confess, I'm tired of "boughie" overpriced donuts. We have them everywhere in LA and while they are delicious, my wallet doesn't quite agree. Thankfully, Al's Donuts is just a straight up non-pretentious donut shop.   They have a wide variety of options and I tried their version of cronuts. It was straight forward, non-snobby, and delicious.  We picked up a few different flavors and devoured them all. You won't find weird toppings here. Just the good ol' favorites: sprinkles, chocolate, lemon,  bacon, well, you get the picture. Check out their website for a full listing of flavors.  Just a word of caution, the area where this shop is located is not...the best. There is a pawn shop right next door and it seems to attract some interesting people. I went during the day and nothing happened, but while I was driving away, I did see a barefoot woman  in PJs drunkenly chasing her half-naked kid in the parking lot. Just saying.
2 Good, but won't be going back. Tried to do the checkin deal which is on their web page but the cashier would not honor it. He said he doesn't know anything about it even though I showed him on my phone.   Cronuts - tasted great, but $36 for a dozen was steep, no discount for buying a whole dozen either.  Breakfast croissants - disgusting! I asked if they were baked fresh and was told they were. Ordered 1 ham and cheese and 2 ham, egg and cheeses. Was charged the same price even though one was without egg. They were $5 which is a rip off. They were given to me in ziplock bags that were microwaved! Egg was hard and ham was cold
3 Came in for the cronuts. Dont expect the real thing here but a good substitute. Location is literally behind a 7-11 store across UNLV, not the prettiest place so come in the daytime. For sure.
4 We have been coming here a couple times to try their cronuts and I must admit that they taste great! This place is nearby UNLV, right behind the 7/11, so it may be a bit hard to find if you are driving there for the first time. Each cronut cost 3.20, which is a small price to pay for a baked good. I enjoyed their raspberry filled cronut. Their bacon was a bit too salty for my liking, but overall, it's a sweet treat! The baker that help us out said that they usually have them freshly baked in the morning around 7am and again at 2pm. So next time we head there, it will be bright and early! haha. They have this promotion where if you like them on Facebook, you get your 2nd donut free.
4 Cronuts! Cronuts! Cronuts!  Bavarian cream is a must. Be sure to visit early, they will go fast!
5 CRONUTS! lady and I were notoriously craving donuts so we searched nearby donut shops and yelp suggest Al's. we bought a half dozen donuts and a maple bacon cronut. Boy I should've ordered a dozen CRONUTS! those things are outta this world and probably made out of rainbows and angel dust. Seriously, go get one....now! Lol
4 My first time having a CRONUT was here at Al's -- to be exact it was a Maple Bacon Cronut! Sooo much better than a regular donut! Crisp outside with a light, buttery, soft inside -- and more of a savory snack. Not TOOO sweet, definitely a craving pleaser. Must try!  The actual place can use a little TLC though... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1 ok ok lets admit it. We ended up in this donut shop because we heard it from somebody that heard it from somebody and said that Cronuts are awesome. I came here sooo early in the morning hoping to get the cronuts fresh and also to avoid the "crowd" that buys up all the cronuts by 2pm.   Ok so my first impression was wt!? there's a kid sleeping on the chair? and the interior is deteriorating. I guess ill give the kid a pass cause i came so damn early.  I bought the $3 maple bacon cronut cause i guess its best seller and wow! diabetes started calling!!! lol  The donut is sweat already. on top of that was some cream dashed with powdered sugar. In the middle has more cream that multiplied the sweetness level by 20.  Considering that I came early I would expect the bacon sprinkled would be freshly cooked...but....nope! its cold and doesn't give the donut justice. The sad part is we bought 6 more to go x[ In conclusion, again thanks to social media for over hyping this Cronut promising me something great but ended up disappointing me just like our Presi-dent lol jk ;)
3 My mom wanted to try the infamous croissant/donut and so I went on the hunt. They were out at the two places I tried before Al's, so third times a charm. We arrived around noon and there weren't any in the display case, but the lady behind the counter let me know that they had some in the back that she was busy dressing so we had free reign on what flavors we could have. By free reign, I mean we were able to choose from the three flavors they have: chocolate, maple and vanilla. I opted to try the chocolate and maple. We didn't order any regular donuts.  This donut shop is right across from UNLV, on the corner or Harmon and Maryland. It's small and not particular noteworthy and a little on the dingy side. The pastries were large and a little overly sweet for my taste. I love powdered sugar, but they were covered in them, so it was a bit of overkill. For the most part, the pastry was moist and had good texture, but I don't see myself going out of my way to try them again soon. I likely won't be back unless I'm in the area again, but it's a good option for students or those who live in the area.
3 Their cronut version was pretty good. A little richer than the one I tried before, but I appreciated this one. Not the best ever, but I liked it. I'd try one without the bacon next time, since I mostly picked off all the pieces of bacon off the top to eat.
4 Stopped in on a whim... Glad we did. The maple bacon Cronut filled with Bavarian cream was very tasty. It was light, the bacon was crunchy and perfect. I also had a regular glazed twist and it was awesome. We went early afternoon and I was surprised by the freshness of them. The place smells wonderful...like pure sugar! If I'm on that side if town again I'll stop by!   The yelp pictures showed WAY more options than what they actually had  so I'm guessing it's because if the time of day we went.
4 The first time I went to Al's was on a cheat day during a no-carb diet. The first donut I had was a freshly made Cronut, he was icing a batch with a honey glaze when I walked in the door. Biting into that hot and still sticky b/c-the-glaze-hasn't-had-time-to-harden-yet donut... been chasing that dragon ever since.   Great donuts. Get them fresh and they are even better.   Non-donut offerings? meh.
4 I went to Al's after stumbling across a review posted online. I went around 4 in the afternoon and was surprised at the selection they still had available. Plus, they were still making more in the back. I had to wait for a few minutes because it looked like there was only one person working but it gave me a chance to decide what I wanted. I ended up buying 2 kronuts, one cream and one raspberry, and two glazed donuts. The glazed were quite big. They weren't as airy as I normally like them, but still yummy. I ate one of the kronuts when I got home and thought it was okay. Once I got past the excess of powdered sugar, which made it a little too sweet for me, it was actually pretty yummy. I'm saving the other one along with the other glazed for tomorrow.  I don't know if I'll be going back anytime soon, it was a little hard to turn in to the parking lot because of the traffic and how relatively close it is to the intersection, but it was well worth it.
5 It's a "dive" of a donut shop with scrumptious donuts!! Kronuts are the bomb and even the plain are yummy, not too sweet and made in the shop. I got there when they opened just after 6am and they were fresh and warm and yummy. Don't go with hipster high trendy expectancy - this is a dive but worth a visit once in a while!
4 CRONUTS!!!  Like most university fare around here, there's great, cheap grub all around.  Al's Donuts doesn't look like anything special, especially when tucked behind a 7 Eleven!  Like most donut shops, get it when it's fresh.  Come later in the afternoon, you'll be lucky to snag a favorite.  Monkey come for CRONUT!  BACON MAPLE CRONUT - Close your eyes and C - r - u - n - c - h - ! - ! into the crispy layers of buttery croissant, bite off that chunk of bacon maple donut and savor the wonder of both.  Wow.  Open your eyes to see what you are tasting, cream-filled, crispy, deliciousness, with a face-full of powdered sugar dusting your shirt, lap and everything else nearby.  Looks and tastes like heaven, right?    RASPBERRY CRONUT - same texture, but with the inviting pink frosting and raspberry filling.  Stick a napkin-bib on your shirt and enjoy outside, standing up, leaning forward if you want to keep your dark blue uniform clean.  Unless you like that "i'm on a diet really i am" look.  In that case, why not eat these while driving?    Believe it or not, Monkey savored a bite of each, then gave to my crew, who never heard of a cronut.  Big mama must've looked like this when she first discovered salted caramels...  Your welcome, Al.
4 I went to this location simply because it was the highest rated doughnut shop on the way home.  The doughnuts looked simply delectable.  The icing on the cake was finding out this shop also sold cronuts!  Cronuts are the buzz in many doughnut shops in Los Angeles, Ca, and to my knowledge, Pink Box in Las Vegas, NV, was the only doughnut shop selling these delicacies!  As much as I want to rate this place a 5-star shop, I'll have to wait until I try more goodies from this place.  Cronuts are the rave right now, but they have way too much frosting.
1 What a disappointment. I have had many Cronuts over the last year and this was the most expensive and worst tasting one of all. Cronut is supposed to be light and fluffy not hard as cardboard. Save your money the selection was weak and overpriced. There apple fritters looked like turds and maple bars tasted like plastic. I am on a quest to rid the valley of this pathetic excuse for a donut shop.
3 There was nothing standout for me here. :/ A certain someone set my standards for kronuts very high and these were definitely not up to par. I went with a regular glazed kronut and a jelly filled (my favorite donut). The jelly filled was dry and crunchy from sitting out and the filling tasted very... Umm... "imitation" I think is the word I'm looking for. The kronut was OK. It seemed doughy to me instead of the fluffy, flaky texture I'm used to. We chose a few other flavors of kronuts and regular donuts, but nothing I will go out of my way for in the future. It could be our own faults, we went later in the day around 10:30. So now you know when not to go. You're welcome! :D   It's no where near our side of town, we found it on our way to cookie bar. It's located in the back of a tiny little lot off of Harmon and Maryland Pkwy. On the left hand side. Like everyone else said, directly across from UNLV.   Hope you have a better donut adventure!
2 Al's Donuts is located on E. Harmon at the corner of Maryland Parkway, kind of tucked away in the back corner of a little shopping complex. You'll find plenty of seating inside though and it was decently clean too, which is always a plus.  When we arrived around 10:30, there wasn't a single customer in the shop and we were surprised to see they still had a decent selection to choose from. Aside from the usual coffee and donuts, they offer a few breakfast sandwiches as well. We ended up ordering only about 8 donuts all together, including 2 kronuts (yes, they spell 'em with a K here) and a couple drinks from the fridge. Our bill was about $20 so I'd suggest sticking with coffee or just doing a pickup if you do come here.  The donuts themselves weren't horrible, but they weren't great either. For the most part, the textures were ok. The regular donuts were really soft but the kronut was lacking in the flakiness department. My biggest problem with pretty much everything we tried, was the taste. Literally everything but the dough itself had a very artificial flavor. From the bacon, to the maple and the worst of them all, the jelly fillings. It's a very distinct artificial flavor that does not put a good taste in your mouth.  For the kronut fanatics out there, I would definitely say it's a no go. There was no kronuts offered without a custard filing and this made them too mushy for me. Another big thing that put me off is how much powdered sugar was on them. I went to take a bite and coughed from inhaling it. It's just overkill.   I didn't get a chance to try any of their regular donuts, like a classic glazed and I imagine they wouldn't be that bad. But since we normally only get donuts when we're craving them, or if we have plans for the day and wake up too late for breakfast, a return trip to Al's is highly unlikely for me.
1 Old ass donuts! This place is horrible.  Kid at the counter tried to charge $16 for a dozen.  There are no prices posted. Old crusty ass donuts smh. Never again. ..never again.
1 AWFUL.  I don't know if ownership has changed since some of these good reviews, but we arrived at 9:00 AM on Sunday, the place was a ghost town and the selection was picked over.  I thought the poor selection was a good sign but my guess is that they make donuts for the week on Sunday night and we showed up at the end of the cycle.  The health department might want to take a peek too.  Looked pretty nasty behind the counter.  Don't let the well done website fool you, Bill Cosby probably hasn't been here in years and I doubt they sell these crappy donuts to casinos.
3 Al's is ok. It keeps changing ownership, and so sometimes it's better than others. Bonus:  they still use the pink boxes.
