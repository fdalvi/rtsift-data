1 Office manager was very rude. They refused to honor the negotiated price of my insurance, saying the doctor did not agree to that price. They wanted to charge me $80 instead of $25. When I asked to speak to the dentist, that did not agree on the price I was told it would be $95. I Just left. This place is the worst, staff was rude and very Ghetto
5 Great service!  Super fast!  Tony the dental assistant was so efficient and gentle.   Dr Miranda really knows how to assess the patients needs and handled my teeth like I was family.  Thanks Radiant dental!!!
5 I had my wisdom teeth removed by Dr. Ruiz about 3 months ago. He did an amazing job. I was comfortable and calm throughout the whole procedure. I love this office and staff. I wait a short amount of time to be seen by the dr. It's not like other offices where they have you sitting in the waiting room for an hour. I recommend this office to anyone looking for a fast, comfortable and caring dental office :)
