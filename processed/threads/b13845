4 How wonderful and delightful my lunch be! I had Asian Chicken grilled salad.  Fun place for kids. The have a nice play area.
4 The fries were a little soggy, but still good. Dr. Pepper was excellent!!!
1 Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb...dumb, dumb, dumb, dum, dummmmmmmbbbbb. Waited in line for-ev-er cuz the sensor didn't pick up our truck. So, we proceeded to the window to place our order & had to tell the girl 3 times that we wanted a Mc-gridd-le, real slow like so they'd understand English, or so we hoped. But alas, it shan't be. They even had it correct on the receipt, but nay, I tell you, nay. The screwed it up afterall.
1 I think I gave this place 6 chances....SIX!  sounds ridiculous, I know.  I guess I suck at life.  I bet this place hasn't served a fresh chicken nugget in months...  If by some act of God, they do happen to deliver some freshly-prepared delicious bits of saturated fat, they know what they have done, and they HATE you for it.  If you're in phoenix or the surrounding areas, fast-food in the summertime is a hot-bed for food-borne illness.  Just look at the front page article in today's Arizona Republic.
3 Day I went service was extremely slow.
3 Clean inside, seems to have been remodeled recently. Same mediocre service, average chain location.
5 Employees work incredibly hard to satisfy customer needs. They deserve more than minimum wage. Also, the cute brunette guy "Eric" I believe is a stud! Charming too!
1 They suck their slow and everbody else is eating while you wait for your fucking food bitches
