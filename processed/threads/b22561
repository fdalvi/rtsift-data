3 So, my husband posted a 27-inch old tube-style TV on Craigslist for $60, and the peeps from this store e-mailed him and offered him $55 cash if he could bring it in. So he did, and they did. Easy money! (He just had to give an ID and a fingerprint so that heaven forbid the TV comes up stolen -- which it won't -- they know exactly who brought it in.)  This location is brand new, so they're paying good money for "any newer electronics" as the guy told us. I've never bought anything here before, but they had a ton of power tools, saws, etc., TVs, bikes, jewelry and computer and stereo parts. The store is really clean and everything is organized on shelves.  Bottom line: if you have sh** to get rid of, they're buying. And if you need sh**, it seems like a pretty clean place to get it, but their prices seemed a little high for other people's used tools, TVs, cameras, etc. Since they didn't have anything there that I am currently in the market for, I didn't have a good basis for comparisons, but still, they seemed pricey. (Ex: a 40-gig video iPod without a charger for $150 and some type of older Dell laptop for $400 -- I don't know the specs, but you can get a basic new one with a warranty for that price. I also saw a nice looking bike, but it was $200 ... you get the point.)
5 This is one of my favorite super pawns.. and i have been to many..  First of all they always have had a nice staff..   Their selection is nice and reasonably priced..
