1 I work in the area so I pretty much check out any new place serving lunch.  Walked into this place today and had a seat.  Wanted to see what was up with the wide variety on the relatively small menu.(Bacon wrapped dog/Chicken gyro/Green chili pork/Korean spiced beef) Waited for 15 mins and no one said a word to me. Not one word.  I saw between 1-3 employees.   Now this place is fairly big, and I was the only on the Eastern side.   There was a bartender the entire time I was there.  About 15 feet from me.  You may be wondering if the place was packed and the bartender was slammed.  Not so much.  There were two other guys there who finished their meal after I was there about 10 mins.  When I walked out, it was just me, the bartender, air and opportunity.  Now I'm sure some of you would have made your presence known and tried to get some service.  Eh, I wasn't in the mood for that, so I just left.  I was confident in the fact that there were other places selling food on downtown Mill.  I may try it again another day.  In the meantime, here's a lil' something to remember me by.
5 This place is across the street from my work and it has become my favorite lunch place in one week. The misters outside keep the outside bar cool (there are 2 bars) so even when it's hot out, I can eat outside. The food is awesome. I've had the shaved beef (basically an Italian beef sandwich), bacon burger (complete w/ egg) and sweet/sour shrimp - all have been delicious and all are under $7. Pretty amazing. It's designed to feel like an 80's arcade, so lots of black paint and cheesy graffiti. Normally I'd say that's corny, but in the context of an 80's arcade, complete with plenty of arcade cabinets, it's pretty spot on. 2 small gripes - if you don't know where to order (like the guy in the other review) you might feel a bit lost. There's a spot on the far east side of the building to order, no waitresses. Also, the beer selection on the outside bar is pretty pitiful. Bud light? No thanks. All in all though, it's deff my new lunch spot.
3 Went here for some drinks and food with my friends... Great decor... Service was friendly... Just a weird setup.  You have to order from a window without a server.   My burger was not very good... It was dry and slathered in mayo without notice.   but  they have video games!
1 I had high expectations for this bar. The bar is extremely bland, and the staff just doesn't care. Came in after opening just to be ignored by the bartender on a slow night. Put some stuff on the walls, and hire a staff that actually cares.
1 Went in here on a Thursday night with a couple of friends. We thought it would be pretty fun to get some drinks and play some classic arcade games. Getting a drink from an uninterested bar staff took longer than it should have, but it happens on Mill. The worst part (and reason for the one star) was the security staff. When trying to go out the front door, we were turned away to go "out the back". Then when heading to the back, asked which side we had to go out (east or west), the bouncer replied "what the f*ck do you think?". I guess we interrupted him while he was holding up the counter. Well, F this place, there are plenty of other places on Mill.
5 Went in with some friends during the day. Our bartender's name was Eric, he was really professional and really good-looking. Drinks were amaze-balls!! And the food was pretty good. The chicken drumsticks are the best on Mill! Go in and ask for Eric!
4 Pretty sweet spot! Has an old school feeling with the old school video games including TWO N64 systems at the booths.  One game that stood out was the skee ball where you can earn points to win free drinks.  Haven't tried the food yet, but I've heard some good things about it, so will definitely be trying the food soon.
5 Went here last Friday for a Birthday Happy Hour!  Very impressed.  Excellent service. Friendly waitress who came around at just the right time. The food was excellent.  I think I had the best wings I've ever had.  They crunched..So Yummy!!  Lettuce Wraps...wow!!  Everything was very tasty and while I did read a review that said they had to go to a window and order then go pick it up themselves....I have to say I never saw a 'window' and we had a waitress that was very attentive, took our orders and served our drinks and food.  They have booths that are a really nice size; they fit a good bit of people (8+) for conversation, so no need to separate your party.  The atmosphere was great, staff great, food great! And for all you girls out there the Bathrooms were Clean!!  As I said we were there for Happy Hour and they had amazing prices for drinks and food.  I have to honestly say "I'VE FOUND MY NEW FUN SPOT!!  Next time I shall partake in some of the video games..
2 I have been here a half dozen times, and at first it was great. Play some classic arcade games, and have some reasonably priced(for mill) drinks. The music can be way too loud at times and give the place a rave feel that I don't prefer. The DJ also place the same 3 long remixes all night long. The loud music and strange crowd is not enough to keep me away, but a recent experience with the staff may mean giving up on this place. A group of friends and I had gone out to celebrate a birthday, and door staff was really friendly to us as we entered until the last person in our group was denied entry. This was our first stop of the night. No one was intoxicated and we were all fairly dressed up for the night. Their reasoning was that my friend was wearing high tops. These were penguin high tops covered by his jeans. I  not even sure how they noticed what kind of shoes he had on, but apparently hightops are a cardinal sin here. Friendly door guy went to an asshole in a heartbeat when my friend asked if he was serious or if he could talk to the manager about it. Mind you we had all been here several tines in the past and never had an issue. At the request for the manager my friend was told, "Go somewhere else if you don't fucking like it!" Not that we had much choice since they were not letting him in... I basically just won't be coming here for quite awhile. It can be a nice place, but as soon as you get comfortable here you may catch a dose of the bad everyone else has mentioned.
4 Stumbling through the 110 degree desert I had found myself in, I came to what could only have been a mirage. A place calling itself a "street bar" with free arcade games and hooters upstairs. I was so dehydrated and delirious, I swore I was seeing things wrong. What did it all mean? My emaciated and sun burnt body could do nothing more than to venture into the mirage.  My friends.... this was a true oasis. I was immediately greeted with cold, flowing air blowing all around me. Cute girls in daisy dukes and tank tops were all over the place. A Galaga machine came to life in the corner. Televisions were playing strange competitions with men wielding sticks being pelted with balls. I thought for certain I was hallucinating.   I took a seat at the bar and a cute female approached and told me it was happy hour from 2 until 9. Surely I had misheard her. That's not happy hour. That's happy all day. $2 beers, cheap food, cheap shots, cheap drinks. WHERE WAS I??!!  The menu was small and weird and I thought someone must be playing a joke on me. Bacon wrapped hot dog? Chicken drumsticks? Korean Style Beef? I settled on the Brat that came with caramelized onions and pickled cabbage and house mustard and it came in something of a bread pocket that seemed like it was baked just to house the sausage. Quite delicious. It started bringing me back to my senses. Some tater tots came perfectly crispy but not burnt and with what I think was queso fresco on top? Or maybe it was the cheese of the gods because they surely must have sent me to this little desert hideaway. God cheese.  If I ever find myself stuck in the desert again, I will surely look for this miracle amongst the sands.
2 this place was a fun,  cheap food, cheap drinks,  fun games.   unfortunately we had to leave because our friend was denied entry.   he committed the blasphemous sin of wearing so called ''athletic sandals'' instead of flip flops.  at least,  that's the distinction the bouncer made sure to make so that we understood clearly his rational for standing his ground against the evil athletic sandals.  i'm just thankful my friend wasn't arrested for such offensive behavior.   i mean,  footwear is a number one priority in 100 degree heat.  so just make sure to call ahead and send several snap shots of your foot apparel over for approval before trying to play skeeball.   they don't play here.  oh,  and be sure not to close the door to the patio.   you'll be looked out and the bros on their cellphones will be too cool to hear you banging o the door for help.
1 Apparently arcade bars now come with dress codes & unbeknown to me, there's a huge difference between flip flops & athletic sandals. It gets to be 115+ degrees in Phoenix during the summer, & my fianc√© was denied entry because he was wearing "athletic sandals" as opposed to flip flops. It was the most absurd ridiculous load of crap I've ever heard. Gringo Star Street Bar... They don't allow you to play skee ball in athletic sandals, but flip flops are okay. LOL! We had 6 friends inside waiting for us, but they all left when they found out we couldn't come inside.
1 Definitely not a place to do to after 9 pm. You can't hear a thing from the person next to you. The service is perfect if you want none, the lack of communication between the servers was remarkable. The drinks were not impressive, lemon drop tasted like battery acid. The games were great however if there's one you wanna play at a different table you're out is luck cause they're bolted down. Did not try the food however it look 15 minutes for shots and about 30 for water, didnt want to risk ordering food.
3 So I went to this place because I loved the idea of playing video games at a bar!  That part did live up to it's potential.  I mean, how could it not?!  Mario Kart + beer = fun.   The two of us ordered food, lettuce wraps and a bbq sandiwch.  The lettuce wraps they put the "meaty" stuff on top of the lettuce making it a mess if you actually wanted to WRAP it.  The "meaty" stuff was actually pretty good, I just wanted to be able to eat it how a wrap is typically eaten.....wrapped up.  The bbq my boyfriend liked so that was a plus.   The service however was awful.  When the waitress took our order we didn't get out that we wanted ice waters and fries before she walked away.  I was left in mid sentence and dying for water in the desert.  With that said, the whole night they had the door open.  It was 105* -_- Misery.  We had two other friends meet us and that's when we started wanting shots and more drinks.  The shots we eventually got tired of waiting to order so we went to the bar and waited 15min for the guy to put together a crappy rendition of a lemon drop and some straight patron shots.  Then the waitress never came back to our stack of empty drinks to ask if we needed/wanted more.  I can only assume she was only so unattentive  because her 4 friends were at the table behind us...nice.  She ended her shift and passed us on to the next available waitress who was equally unattentive.  We ended up using the bartender for everything more than any of the waitress'.  The last group of shots we ordered the bar tender yelled them to the waitress to add them to our tab.  Not 5min later she comes over with another round thinking we were ordering them.  Great communication. We of course took them with a smile and went on our merry way.  Lastly, if you want to be able to communicate with other people at the table you will want to make sure you leave before 10PM.  It will soon turn into douchville USA with louder music and less people.    Great idea, unfortunately poorly executed.  My hope is they work on their customer service and things can only go up from there!
1 After two visits to this place with mixed results, figured it's time for a Yelp review. Both times on a Monday to take advantage of Happy Hour and free games. For a little background, I'm a recent ASU grad, now work in an office on Mill and am generally a fan of Fork & Dagger's other restaurants, including Canteen and Handlebar.   However, Gringo Star is a big disappointment.   On our first visit, a couple weeks after they opened, everything went relatively well. The food prices are great for the quantity and quality of the food, and everything we tried on the menu was great - the pork tostada, the chicken drumsticks, the tatertots, and especially the fried okra - which is one of my favorite veggies and hardly ever found on AZ menus. For $2, you get a giant basket of the stuff - it's amazing.   We sampled some of the specialty cocktails and really enjoyed the maple whiskey sour and another one that had Mountain Dew (sounded gross, but it was awesome!). Our server wasn't great, forgetting to put in half of the tables order at one point, meaning we waited forever to get our food when our friends already had theirs. Since they were relatively new at the time, we figured it probably would just take some time to iron out the kinks.   I was surprised by how few arcade games they actually had - I've been to similar places back in New York/New Jersey that had way more packed into much less space. Even though this place seems to want to be a "barcade," the focus seems much less on the arcade part. This was made evident by the condition of some of the games - the wait staff hadn't picked up any of the gross old glasses and napkins littering the floor in the arcade area, and when we told our waitress one of the driving games wasn't working, making it impossible to have two-player action, she didn't seem to give a rat's ass. Heaven forbid we actually want to play games on freeplay night, my bad.   After all that, I did however decide to give it another try and meet a girlfriend after work (5:30 p.m.) at the bar. The bartender said it was her first day on the job, but she seemed nice enough, so we tried to be patient. We had to flag her down for EVERYTHING: water, a happy hour menu, a second time so she could bring us the drink list, then when we ordered our drinks and food. Grrrrr.   When we ordered our drinks, I was sad to see they took the Mountain Dew cocktail off the menu, but we decided to give the Princess Peach and the Paint Splatter a try, both of which turned out to be pretty tasty. Our bartender admittedly didn't know how to make either of the drinks, and had to wait to find someone else to help her. I understand not having perfected every drink on the menu, but when there's only about 6 or 7 different cocktails on the menu, how about you train your BARTENDERS how to make them? Servers is one thing, but don't put a girl behind the bar that doesn't know how to make anything.   She then tried to cash us out before our food had even arrived, which I thought was a bit rude. I asked if she had any clue when we might get our food, and she then ran to the kitchen and grabbed us two lukewarm platters - our okra and chicken drumsticks. I got the sinking feeling that it had been sitting back there for a bit since she completely forgot to do any part of her job.   Despite the fact that the place was pretty empty when we got there, the music was so loud by 6 p.m. (on a MONDAY!) that we couldn't even hear each other talk to have a conversation. We weren't the only ones who thought this was annoying, as the group of guys sitting across from us tried to get the bartender to turn it down. She said she didn't know how, so we all were forced to suffer through deafening noise.   We didn't stay long, playing only a bit of skeeball before we just couldn't take it any more. I won't be going back to Gringo Star unless I hear some major improvements happen. This place seems way less quality than Fork & Dagger's other joints, and although they might stay in business when school starts up again just by pandering to Fireball-shot demanding bros, but they're majorly effin it up on being a good place to swing into between 5 and 7 on a weeknight.
4 I'm new to the Tempe area and heard Mill Ave was a pretty big deal for nightlife. I stumbled upon Gringo Star located between Hooters and a Piano Bar, and my friends and I figured we would give it a try. When I walked in, the place was very busy and had a good crowd going on. I tried ordering a drink but the bar was packed and just as I turned around I got approached by someone asking me if I wanted a drink. I assumed it was a cocktail waitress but it was hard to tell, nonetheless, I ordered a drink and she came back very quickly! it wasn't the best cocktail I've ever had but hey the prices were not to bad.  As I continued to walk, there were old school video games lined up, another bar located in the back, a decent sized outdoor area, a food menu?, and bottle service tables. Not your average college bar. Everyone looked like they were having a great time and I had some good vibes. Overall, I would say Gringo Star definitely is a great and really fun bar. My only concern... Why did it take me so long to find the bathrooms? FYI, plug for boys, outlet for girls. Don't mess this one up people.  I'll definitely check this place out again because that menu looked fantastic. During the school year, guaranteed Gringo Star will be mobbed!
4 Pretty great new bar on Mill. Great crowd, decent drink prices.
4 Despite the negative reviews of this place i went anyway.  I was NOT dissapointed.  I went there around 3 pm and wasnt aware of happy hour. Their happy hour deals are insane. $3 Four peaks drafts. $6 cocktails. $4 chicken drumsticks. You cant beat their prices. So with that said i went a little crazy. Ill give you a review of all the things i got:  Bacon burger - Phenominal. The buns arent your regular fare. They are some sort of toasted, maybe sourdough. The bacon was meaty, the cheese and toppings were good.   Chicken drumsticks - The way they made/served these was fun. They take the meat and push it down towards the bigger part of the drumstick like they do in higher end reastaurants. Covered it in a sweet barbecue sauce, then instead of serving it with blue cheese, they sprinkled CRUMBLES on all the pieces.   Sweetpotato fries - Pretty good. They are served with ketchup (would have preferred dijon mustard) and they sprinkled maybe shredded parmesean?   Chili pork - No. The meat tasted like it was sitting for a while. It was pretty bland. The old lady liked it but after having all the other amazing food....it just wasnt up to standard.  Gringo Donut - Dont be fooled, this isnt a donut. BUT ITS SO FUN. They take a friend dough (similar to those fried sugar donut things at chinese restaurants) put 2 bananas on it , with some vanilla pudding and nutella. if i could curse on here i would. it was amazing  Turkey brat - This one was street food done classy. A brat, topped with bright pink cabbage, some random toppings. THe best part was the toasted (chibatta?) bread they put it in. It was nice and crunchy like french bread.  It was a little loud in there but...its a bar on mill. What do you want...Fred Astaire? its a bar...with VIDEOGAMES...and STREET FOOD. Service was good. No complaints. Smiles and friendly. Attentive.   To wrap it all up; even the NON happy hour prices are still legit. The service was good, the crowd at 5 pm was decent, nice bug beautiful windows to look out of, and the food....OH the food was amazing. Seriously, just try it once. You cant always take peoples word on these reviews. Generally people come on here when they have something to complain about. TRY IT!
3 Happy Hour rolls from 3-9pm, clearly exceeding my happy Hour hours expectations. Can't beat $2 domestic drafts. Just stopped in for a beer with a few others on a Saturday afternoon. Guess we picked the absolute worst time because three loud Frat boy drunks or maybe just punks were cursing their way through our entire 45 minutes there, yelling weird noises and acting like it was their first time with some alcohol in their hands. The bar is pretty big, although the back bar was closed, but once we got away from them, it was a decent experience. Bartender should be tossing these folks out, not serving them more poison.       The skee ball is the most inventive part of the place offering free drinks for a score of 450, which you will have a hard time achieving, plus $2 buys you a drink anyway, so this is useless. In the good ole days, those 100 point slots were not there, but then again skee ball was actually 10 cents when I was roaming the arcades. The TV situation was good, but this place may be at a disadvantage when the weather turns better with no patio. Pac man was the only worthy arcade game out of only five in the place and the manager wouldn't tell us who the communist looking guy was that adorns all the walls in the place. No, we don't want to guess for you to buy us a $2 beer, just tell us and get it over with. Ohh such a big secret. It is not even a person, it is all photo-shoppped, so stop being so secretive dude.
5 Very unique spot on mill ave! The artwork, atmosphere, and video/arcade games gave the place a great vibe. The menu is kinda random, but I have yet to be disappointed in my selection. My personal favorite so far is definitely their spicy korean beef.   The staff has always been super friendly, attentive, and laid back. This is the type of place I enjoy going to after a long day of work with some buddies. Not the type of place I would go to grab a quick bite, I always end of staying for a couple hours.
5 I FRIGGIN' LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  Everything about it screams, "FUN" in a casual way.  The food is remarkably outstanding given how inexpensive it is...noteworthy...the fried okra...outstanding...the Bacon Cheeseburger is anything but your average fare...high quality meat, smoky bacon, outstanding bun.  The Shaved Beef Sandwich is also excellent and one of my favorites...its like an authentic Philly Cheesesteak in that really great bun again.  The Korean Beef tastes so good...its a bit messy so try this on...order the lettuce wrap with the Korean Beef in it...way easier to eat.  And you gotta try the Gringo Donut...what a blast!  Nothing like it...bananas, vanilla pudding and nutella?  Righteous!  The Happy Hour is the best deal in town...hands down.  Tuesday nights they have some really great, live music.  The vintage arcade games...I mean really...what an awesome concept...the only downside is that if you're in there for Happy Hour and you're not careful, you'll be too tanked to know what's goin on by the time it really starts crankin at 11...BUT...you won't have to stand in line for 30 minutes to get in either...  This place oozes "good time"...If you can't have a great time at Gringo, you don't have a pulse.  Get your pals and get in there...
4 This place has a great vibe!  The staff is awesome and they've got great food and drinks as well as great deals!
2 I think if I was trashed or high, I would've had a better experience.  But I was completely sober and I felt like I was in a horrible music video that was trying to imitate Project X, sans the swimming pool.  I actually think it's pretty cool that they have video games at the booths where you sit, and arcade games throughout the place - but because it was so crowded, there were people utilizing the skeeball machines as a bed to make out on.  It smelled like barf, which i'm not surprised because I'm sure people were throwing up in the corners and the smell is amplified and distributed in the air even more because its so damn hot and stuffy.    The good thing about it though - I remember a good variety of music was being played.  A mix of hiphop, rap, EDM....   I would prob come back.... if I was high.
5 Since writing my initial review, I received a message from a manager at Gringo Star and he apologized for my not so great experience, even though it definitely wasn't his fault.  He proceeded to offer to buy me a few rounds next time I come in for a more enhanced experience.  I am giving 5 stars this time because he is representing the business in a  good way, and his message was very nice and courteous even if my review was sorta mean.  I was just trying to be descriptive and super honest as possible.
3 Great happy hour every day, fun place to play some old arcade games. Also has a decent amount of TVs to watch games on. The service was less than spectacular, waited for a while to be approached. The food tasted like typical overly fried bar food, and was a little over priced.
5 I wanted to give the staff at RS a big high 5 for the great service my family and I received last night. I went in with a dying cell phone and our waitress informed the bartender that my phone was dying, he came over and lent me him charger. That ment so much to me because I was quite a ways from home. The food was so good and the tea was fantasic, our glass was never empty and our belly were full when we left.   Thank you all again for the great service and good food.
2 Nice decor, decent service, crappy arcade games. I can't really figure out what this bar is trying to be but it isn't fun or cool. I guess it's cheap, so that's a plus.
1 So this place is packed with ninner fans on Sundays (no I am not one of them) they have $2 budlights which was nice for me budget, the food is all street style and was very good. Buuuuut the service was by far the worst I've ever,had! tracking down someone to take your order for drinks or food is not as easy as you'd think. By the time we found "veronica" we were starving and thirsty. She was very inattentive and we were literally yelling and waving our hands to get her attention, she had no personality and when we told her we were tired of yelling for her she just nodded, no apology what so ever! By the time we got our bill I realized why, they add tip to every bill on Sundays no matter what. So hey why be a nice friendly server when your gguaranted tip anyways right? Only came bbecause of a groupon iI bought, but I def won't be back, she ruined it for us.
2 We were so happy to see this place and give it a try.. We went without checking Yelp and now that I have I see several others have had similar experiences.. Fisrt off the food was good--not great --but good.  We sat outside and it took 3 tripsin over almost 25 minutes to get a waitress.. She came out finallt and took our order but ignores the dirty table in from of us.. When we asked for a rag to clean the table she brought one and then started to hand it to us to wipe off the table.. The look n my face probably frightened her and she decided to do it.  There were 3 of us and only one ever received a drink refill.  They were just iced tea and soda.. Two people ordered wings and one a burger.  No napkins.  Had to ask again.  Pretty much that trend continued  through out our time there and so to sum up--Food is OK--Service is VERY bad and they werent even busy.  Probably make another choice from now on and will say thats disappointing.. Had high hopes.
1 First time here this past sunday 12-17-13 was looking for a nice place to watch the niners game. Me and my buddy eric came down sat at the back bar, service started out good but buy the 4th quarter of the game couldn't get a beer to save my life. Will say food is good when it does come. Not sure if ill be back....
4 This place has an extended Happy Hour, it's almost a Happy HalfDay.  Seems like theres a lot of room inside but we sat outside. I had the burger and I actually forget what my wife had but we both enjoyed it.  Sports on the TV, server was really good and I liked their house drinks.
1 Bouncers here are rude and disrespectful. Decided to check this place out last friday night. One of my friends who was not 21 paid the bouncers 40 bucks to get in. My other friend who is 21 was denied access because the bouncers said they don't allow Jordan sneakers. I went inside to check out the place and besides cheap drinks this place needs a lesson in customer service and federal laws.
4 I'm surprised this place doesn't get good reviews.  I went out here for a night out in Mill with some friends and I had a lot of fun.  This place attracts a very friendly crowd of college kids and young professionals.  What more can you ask for a scene?  You can dance anywhere you like, it's a NINERS bar (I think), and it's a huge venue that's got everything you need in a bar.
4 Came here on a snoozy Tues. afternoon. Happy hour is excellent. Waitress was courteous, and fairly attentive. I think on a busy weekend things could get behind.   Big plus was the prices were great for the quality and variety of food.  Best described as a "munchies" menu. Some entree items, but filled with tons of appetizers, all of which were good.   The atmosphere was nice, separate booth, with a decent bar selection and some tables.   Music was..all over the place- though not crazy loud until later around 6:00.   What bumps this up from a 3 star to 4 was the variety, quality and price point of food, as well as the privacy of booths.   Would recommend for small groups, casual meetings, and just dinner and drinks with friends. Decimates not a get in and out place, on the hand they don't rush you either.   I will most definitely return.
2 I guess if you are going for drinks and typical bar food you would give this place more stars.  I bought a groupon to try the place and was expecting more of a restaurant / bar than just a bar.  I was not sure how to spend my Groupon after seeing it was just a bar (I don't drink).  After trying the food I was waiting for Gordon Ramsey to come through the door but he never did.  So go for the drinks, definitely not the food.  Tried 3 things on the menu and none were good.  The waitress was very good though so kudos to her.
1 African Americans beware, this establishment will judge you based on your appearance as long as you are who you are. I was allowed in because I wasn't a problem for them. I'm wearing slacks a button down shirt and polo boots. Tell me why they needed to discuss if I should be let in?   Most of their patrons are wearing jeans, cheap button down shirts and tennis shoes. If this isn't racism at its best in the valley of the sun, I don t know what being oppressed or racially profiled is.   Don't f@#! with Gringo Star! They don't like minorities, kittens, or babies.
5 The staff is attentive, the music good and the security is top notch. Always make it a point to hit this spot. The food is actually really great I had the hummus plate and it was fresh and had cooked eggplant, it really did it for me!
5 Came here on a week night after seeing a picture of the burger.  I have to say it was as good if not better than what it looked like. Definitely the best burger on mill.  Highly recommend going when it's not so packed just to eat and grab some drinks
5 My publisher and I stopped here for a quick bite and I had the pesto margarita pizza and ate 1/2 of it and have to say it was amazing I love pesto and cheese so that is hard to screw up, great service too- the sandwich Joe ordered is the one I was eyeballing but knew it would be soggy when I brought what I couldn't eat home for my late night snack- Joe had the ultimate Chicken club which was so yummy that I am craving it now. Nice bartender, hip place and if you want to watch a football game they definitely are the place to go, or any sports for that matter - prices were decent for Mill ave and I'll be back soon
4 I like this place. I arrived at this place on a thursday afternoon 3pm.  i love retro games so the Arcade games inside was great.   The bacon burger was good. They could have used a bigger meat patty but it's okay.   Bartender was a hot blonde and the server was a cute looking brunette. :)   I will go back to this bar soon. maybe on a Saturday night, hope to meet many good looking college chicks at this place. :)
4 Out of all the bars to go to on Mill, Gringo is the best. It is always a ton of fun and the music is great on the weekends after 10. I wouldn't go here to eat because honestly, who goes to these places to eat? So no comments on the food.  Now that El Hefe is open, though, I'm not sure how much longer this will be my number 1 spot in Tempe. Stiff competition.
5 Came here for happy hour yesterday and sat at the bar. Only go if Danny is working, she is quite easy on the eyes and got us to stay after we were originally going to hop around on Mill if that says anything. Good drinks, cheap food.
5 5 stars in the BAR CATEGORY.  The food is waaaaaaay above average for a bar. Surprise attack on my belly. All hands on deck! The menu is short and sweet, but tasty.  Many tv's, indoor seating, outdoor seating, sofas, tabletops, barstools, games, 2 bars, etc..  Long Happy Hour from 3pm-9pm.  Customer service was great. Twice I was asked if I needed help finding the restroom. I laughed because I was simply checking out the property....appearing to be lost. I promised one of the gals I would Yelp her. I didn't get her (their) name(s), but here it is.  I've always been a fan of this property, but previous owners keep moving on. I sincerely hope the new owners receive the credit they deserve at Gringo Star Street Bar.  The cherry on top...NINER BAR! I can't talk about the 49ers so soon -- It still hurts. However, I will add this bar to my list of "away game" travel destinations. Second to my favorite, 'Typhoon Saloon' in Pacific Beach, San Diego...but MUCH better food.  The end.
4 Very laid back place with retro arcade games and Nintendo 64 on some of the wall tables for you to play with old school games.  The service was friendly and pretty quick.  not a fan of the plastic draft beer glasses, that were more like scotch glasses, only knock. Food was pretty good and great happy hour prices on drinks and some snacks. Would definitely like to go back.
1 Never again will I be coming here.I had 2 unfortunate visits and they were both equally painful.First off the bouncers are tools and they all look as if they were suffering from severe constipation. I should be glad that they're working security instead of an occupation that requires intelligences. I was wearing my hat in a normal fashion and they found it to be out of "regulations" so they made me pull down my hat until the brim was touching my eyebrows.Of course, I adjusted my hat to my preferred setting as soon as I got in.Second off the bartender was off in her own world and was very rude because I requested a beer while she was in deep conversation.Don't worry darling your "guy" won't be walking off anytime soon, it seems that he's been drinking heavily and has trouble standing up.Third off, the demographic of people here,Holy geez! some of the most self centered, self entitled group of people I've ever dealt with.I wandered off into someones booth on accident to take a seat and some girl flips out on me like I broke something.Settle down woman, it's 130am there is 30mins left before this place closes. I think the party has already surpassed it's peak.So all this cussing,yelling and name calling is not necessary.As for the second trip? You don't want to know.
1 This bar is horrible. Between my group of girlfriends, there has been 2 incidents of roofies! This place is disgusting and the men are sleazy. As soon as you walk in, they try to shove drinks down your throat so that 15 minutes later, you don't know where you are. LADIES, BEWARE OF THIS PLACE!!!!! It's not a safe spot to be drinking and for some reason they attract the lowest of the low here.
1 Hahaha this place is joke....  Because I'm wearing basketball shorts I can't get into the bar really?  First off I have a  non crimal back ground and took one look at me like I'm a fool.  Second of all I've faught for My country and I was in 140 degree heat why would I wear pants when it's nice out and third of all,  they need to get bigger shirts..  Shmediums don't look good if your a bouncer.  I also would have been a high paying customer I make great money I would spend money there but now you lost my business for good but I'll make sure all my friends know don't go there at all they can't afford us to have shorts on...  Oh and another excuse was that they are black short....  This place can stick to the skinny jean society...  Thank you...
1 My purse was stolen in November of 2013. My phone, keys, and wallet among other things were in it. It was unclear if it was a prank or if someone dropped it off somewhere. Regardless, the next afternoon when the bars opened my mom and I went to numerous bars on Mill Avenue. Gringo Star was one of them. I asked the bar tender twice if my purse was found there, told them the color, etc. etc. The bar tender looked at me and said no no one found a purse. He didn't check with anyone else nor leave his post behind the bar. The experience cost me around 500.00 We had to have someone come out and laser cut a key so I could get my car, I had to order a new phone, buy new makeup, and also have my house rekeyed since they had all my keys and my drivers license. March 2014, I receive an email from a friend of mine on Facebook telling me some guy in Tempe has my purse at this restaurant. When I contacted this person and the Manager, I was basically told... woopsies, it was black and it was sitting where the wait staff put their purses so no one knew that it was there. It was not in the lost and found because that bin was TOO full. I went to retrieve it, everything was in the purse except for my phone. All my cards, medicine, makeup, keys, etc just not my phone. I picked the purse up that following saturday and the new bar back offered to buy me a drink next time I came in. Welp thank you for that DRINK... now that you cost me 500.00 when it would have been rectified saved me the 500.00 had someone actually checked the back. I've never had food or drinks at the business but based on this I will not be supporting this business nor recommend it to anyone I know.
5 This place is fantastic. It has officially made it to my favorite place on mill. I was looking for something like this on mill actually. It has a mini arcade, which encompasses a Nintendo 64 with games! (Yes, they have Smash Bros as well as some other popular games, yeah you bet I played on that.) And they have a large dance floor with a DJ - and played a lot of hip hop music (swoon - this place just keeps getting better).   I came on a Thursday night and we peaked in at around 11 and it was dead, then came back around at 12:30/1:00 and it was packed. So don't be fooled, it'll get packed for sure, maybe even more than you'll like. But I think it was perfect - just enough people on the dance floor to get it poppin and just enough space to be able to actually move.  I was here to drink and dance so I didn't get to try the food, but all of these reviews with photos are making my mouth water and go back for it! Next time!  Well the bathrooms were questionable, but not too bad. No lines though, which was good.   Oh and there's two bars, one at the front entrance and one around the corner at the back. There are also couches all the way in the back too. Super comfy ones! :)  In addition to everything wonderful previously stated, there's also a long patio.   I guess the only negative is that the staff were 100% busy all of the time, so they couldn't get to you right away, you'd have to wait. In addition, the floor was massively wet and dirty and should have been cleaned up immediately for all the spillage that occurred that night instead of letting people splash through it. I think they need more staff to be able to stay on top of all the mayhem that continually happens. But overall, it's a great place and is definitely now my favorite on mill ave.
5 I'm originally from Chicago so I'm no stranger to good food. I saw this place on groupon and wanted to try it out during my visit to AZ. It was fricken awesome to say the least. The vibe was fun and the food was amazing. My friends and I split the bacon burger, Korean BBQ, and a couple other sides. Everything was delicious and I will definitely come back to Tempe just for this place!!
1 This place is horrible..... i paid for a $9 margarita that was literally salt water. The beer was room temperature. My friend and I went in for happy hour and we asked the waitress what their happy hour menu was and she told us she didn't know and told us she would get back with us on their specials and never did. Finally found the menu hidden under the old nintendo64 console and we ordered the bacon wrapped hotdog, fried ocra, and wings. The food was COLD!!! It sucks because we could've just gone to Hooters upstairs or Big Bang downstairs but we wanted to try something new and we were completley dissapointed. I HIGHLY WARN AGAINST GOING TO THIS PLACE!!! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
4 I liked the DJ. He was mixing up some dope beats. I dug the crazy video clips they were playing on the screens. I was sippin $4 Bacardi Mango Fusion #OnPoint   The bad: Way too many dudes in the bar.   -1 Star
3 I am probably not the target demographic for this bar, but still decided to stop in one Saturday afternoon for a drink and some quick eats.  The food was cheap and actually pretty decent and they had a good selection of beer.  Nice bartenders too!
1 This was the absolute WORST bar I have ever been to in my life!!! I would say avoid it at all cost if you can! The service was horrible and if you are not the right color you will not get service!! I will never be back there and I would say if you want to have a good time you should go else where! The music sucked, again I say the service was horrible!!! I waited at the bar for 30 minutes and was refused service and when I ask why the bartender then told me it was because "they have the right to refuse service" just because I was standing at the bar waiting for service!!! For ANYONE looking for a good time please avoid this bar you can have a better time and have faster service anywhere else on mill!!!
4 My sister and I went there post fireworks on the 4th of July. It is like the Tardis. It is totally bigger on the inside. At first you see the bar and think that is it, but then you turn the corner and see 2 N64 video game systems. Needless to say, my sister stayed here most of the evening.   Everyone was friendly and although the bartenders were extremely busy, I was able to get my drinks after my turn.   After the bar, past the N64's you turn left and it is more games, arcades, skeeball and music.   Even past that...you get seats for bottle service and another bar area. It was hard to find a good spot to dance, but the music was good, the people who work there were friendly and efficient and the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it was hard to dance (but it may not be intended for that) and I didn't try the food, so it is not my place to rate the food.   Really nice surprise. Thanks for a great night!
