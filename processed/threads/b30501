5 St. Louis Bar and Grill is the neighbourhood place for Chicken Wings and Beer.  I was there with a buddy of mine and we had the Wing Platter and a pint of Grasshopper (an excellent wheat beer from Alberta, it was on draft) and both were excellent.  Service was fast and friendly, and the free Wi-Fi was definitely a plus.  The establishment is close to RIM Park and on this visit there were lots of folks there for a hockey tournament.  Even though it was busy, the staff  were able to deliver great service!
3 We came in for a quick meal before the Kitchener Rangers game.  It was a fairly busy crowd for a Sunday afternoon.  At the time we arrived, there was 1 bartender and 1 waitress for the entire restaurant.  They were clearly busy.  Staff were friendly and trying their best to be attentive, which I appreciated.  The waitress was quite busy, so the bartender came over to take our order.  We had Buffalo Chicken Wraps.    Given how busy the restaurant was, I was pleased with how fast we received our order.  The only description I can use to describe our dinner was "bland".  Wraps really had no taste.    Not a memorable dinner but they do get marks for trying really hard to take care of everyone.  I am sure the kitchen was in the same boat.  Management should probably staff better.  I have been here before and has always been a decent experience.  For that reason, I give 3 stars...
