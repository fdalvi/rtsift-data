3 Definitely a discount shoe store. Boxes up to the ceiling, but I guess I should expect that being at the outlet mall. Wasn't very organized though... corresponding shoes not on the right shelves. It was Sunday, so maybe it was a bit busy for everything to be sorted.  The cashier at check-out was very friendly. She didn't suggest I get a 2nd pair for half off like they normally. Guess I saved a little money. Usually doesn't happen with shoe shopping ;)
4 Nice selection of shoes, especially for kids.
3 Another stop in my quest for fall and winter boots, I browsed the shelves at Famous Footwear while I was at the outlets returning a pair of jeans to the Gap. Standard selection and service was friendly but let me peruse at my own pace, which I prefer.   I didn't find anything on this particular visit, but they have a nice selection and the store is pretty organized and clean.
1 Purchased a pair of shoes and decided to return it. They refused my return based on the fact that they were worn and they could not resell them. I bought the shoes 4 hours earlier, went home to try it on with socks and decided it didn t work. When I purchased it, they were slightly dirty on the sole which I just assumed was from others trying it on. I m not nitpicky and it was the only pair in the size that I needed available. If they are unable to sell used shoes why did I manage to get a pair out of the store AFTER the associate looked them over?? Maybe FF should consider leaving a sample size of each shoe for you to try on then you ask for a brand NEW pair that s kept in the back?!?!
1 I have never received such poor customer service at a shoe store in my life. I asked about current promotions or sales and was given a roundabout sort of answer. Later at checkout the person at the registers did not have any information about the promotion I was asking about. After clarifying the buy 3 pairs get 10% off text promotion, I could not get a phone signal to finish the text transaction in order to get the coupon code. A person trying to provide quality customer service would have given me the measly 10%, instead I was told to go outside and restart my phone until I could get the code. I'm not sure I'll return to Famous Footwear in general if this is how they treat their customers.
