4 Love the Dental Depot.  Dr. Fine knows his stuff + puts you right to ease. The kitschy train decor and little train running throughout the building is beyond cute. The staff is great -- getting me in last minute or scheduling on a Saturday. Plus, they've worked closely with my insurance to make sure there isn't any surprises when it comes time to pay.
5 I was very impressed. The equipment was brand new, the staff was incredibly friendly, and they were gentle when cleaning my teeth.  I made an appointment because it was close to our house and saw it being built. Will continue to recommend this place, very pleased overall!!!
3 My son LOVES the trains in the play area, and the office staff is helpful.  Two concerns, both involving communication.  One, I asked about the fluoride treatment before they gave it to my son, and my question was completely brushed over and she stuck it in his mouth before I could decide if I wanted him to have it or not.  Whether I would have said yes or no, I don't like the fact that the decision was basically not even given to me.  When the dentist found two fillings, and I asked about preventing (other than brushing/fluoride) in the future, he targeted drinking juice.  My son doesn't like/drink juice, or soda for that matter.  He always asks for water, and that is what he has 99.99% of the time.  The dentist was gone before I could ask anything else, and considering we had a 10 a.m. appt. and the dentist did not enter the room until 10:45, (we waited in the lobby until almost 10:30), one would expect them to take at least a few minutes to talk to you.  Not sure if I can trust them or if we'll go there again, which is a shame because my son really likes the trains.
