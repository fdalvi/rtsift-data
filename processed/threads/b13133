5 Binkley's is the best restaurant in town, period.   Chef Kevin Binkley, who I understand worked with Thomas Keller at the infamous French Laundry, has a genuine passion for innovative cuisine (foie gras dipping dots anyone?).   My husband and I have been to this restaurant several times within the last year and at each  visit we are completely blown away by the exciting choices on the tasting menu and the wonderful little amuse bouche treats.  The restaurant also has an impressive wine selection and the staff are top notch.    Don't let the unassuming stripmall location fool you....this place will be getting lots of national foodie press very soon!
5 (Updated 10/25/07) We need a 6th star for this place.  Forget about Capital Grill, this is the place to go if you call yourself a foodie or want to be one.    The tasting menu at Binkley's is the way to go.  It starts off at $60 for 4 courses, $65-72 for 5 courses and $77 for 6 courses.  A steal, I tell you, compared to French Laundry's (where Kevin Binkley used to work) $200+ tasting menu and it's almost just as good plus you get to pick your dishes and you don't have to deal with 2 month advance reservations.  The drive to Cave Creek is so worth it!  Even more amazing is that they give you a ton of really creative amuse bouche (little morsels to amuse your mouth) before your first course even hits the table and then more throughout the meal.  We got at least ten tonight.  What a deal!  Just to give you an idea of the amuse bouche craziness, this is some of what we got in the last two meals (check out the pixs above if you wanna see what tasty looks like): - parsnip soup - baby zucchini with organic tomato-caper relish - tomato water with sriracha jelly & celery salt (on strobe light) - romeseco with Parmesan foam & eggplant chips - house pulled mozzarella with golden raisins & almond - sausage with artichoke chip - green apple sorbet & grapefruit sorbet - puffed wild rice crispy treat  Wine pairing is available and highly recommended.  Dan the sommelier is super cool and used to be a humanitarian photographer traveling all over 3rd world countries.  The staff here have really interesting backgrounds and manage to strike the balance between being professional and friendly.  Make sure to ask for the tasty potato chips (usually just served at the bar). If you can imagine those colorful Terra Chips reaching "be all that they can be" level of goodness, then you'd know what I mean.    Menu changes daily to keep with seasonality and what's fresh.  Hope they keep the divine Burgundy Truffle Pumpkin Agnolotti for a little longer so that I can have it at least one more time.
5 This place will BLOW YOU AWAY!!  If you appreciate the culinary expertise that is truly given to only a few.... this is one of those places!  The food is designed to make your mouth excited at every bite!  It is a known fact that our brains recognize something new, and then after a few minutes adjust. So, the best the food will taste is within the first two to three bites.  The whole menu is designed this way.  Small portions, but many, many WOW's for your mouth.  I don't care where you've been in the Valley... nothing compares to this restaurant.  It is a bit pricey but worth every penny!  I would suggest doing the wine pairing that they offer with the different courses.  The wine pairings are perfect and make the whole experience all the better.  Service...excellent, Food... Outstanding!  I highly suggest a reservation two to three weeks in advance if you are wanting to dine between 6-9 on the weekends.  Also, if you have a Birthday or Anniversary, they will print the occasion special on your Menu.  Very slick!
3 This may be heresy but I felt like the food was just pretty good.  Certainly the chef is a down to earth , nice host.  The restaurant is small and in a nice location way in Cave Creek.  We drove from Chandler for this meal and had the tasting menu.  Some courses were very good and some fair (especially the Asian fusion stuff - seems to never work for me)  only.  We enjoyed the experience but it wasn't the best ever.  It's worth a try if you are nearby but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.
1 This place is trying WAY too hard!   To establish my fine dining cred, I've eaten at world-class restaurants including The Restaurant Guy Savoy (best restaurant in the world, hands down) and Taillevent in Paris; Gordon Ramsay's Boxwood Cafe in London, Enoteca Pinchiorri in Florence; Cabaa Las Lilas in Buenos Aires; Charlie Trotter's, Topolobampo and TRU in Chicago; Daniel Boulud at the Ritz-Carlton and the Blue Door at the Delano in South Beach; Chez Panisse in Berkeley; Jardiniere and Fleur de Lys in San Francisco; Picasso Restaurant at Bellagio and Bradley Ogden at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas; Larry Forgione's An American Place in St. Louis; etc.  I know a thing or two about fine dining. So what went wrong? Binkley's does not have a firm grasp of the fundamentals of fine dining.  We drove from downtown Phoenix to the hinterlands of Cave Creek for what we hoped would be an exciting culinary experience. Since Binkley's is located in metro Phoenix, it was no surprise to find it in a strip mall. However, it was a bit of a surprise to see how derelict that strip mall was.  Once the BF and I began to peruse our menus, I started to notice omens. The first was that literally nothing on the menu sounded good to me. A couple of tables over, a server dropped a pitcher of water on a woman's lap and all over her cell phone. The restaurant did nothing to make amends to the poor woman who sat there trying to mop up her drenched outfit and rescue her mobile with the napkin in her lap.   We went for the full six-course tasting menu with the wine pairings and the BF added the Foie Gras. Then we received what we assumed would be the only amuse bouche of the night. Chef Kevin, please recall that an amuse bouche is a tiny bite-sized morsel traditionally served before the first course of a meal. At Binkley's, they're into amuse bouche a go-go. They serve them between each course and they get weirder and weirder. The final one was served on a pulsing LED coaster like the kind they use to buzz you for your table at a chain restaurant. The double shot glass on the pulsating coaster was meant to look like a lava lamp, but it reminded me of the ill-fated Orbitz soft drink that had edible balls floating in it. Drinking Orbitz was like having Willy Wonka do something naughty in your mouth and the Binkley's version was no better.      The food ranged from atrocious to merely passable. My first course was a "salad" of a couple of specks of hearts of palm and a few morsels of dates strewn across my plate without dressing. The waiter made a huge deal out of my not finishing the course and this would repeat every time he came to take a plate away as the food never improved. He would then take my plates into the display kitchen so that Chef Kevin could see I was not eating most of his food and he would ask the waiter why. I could hear and see all of this. The staff and the chef made me feel extremely uncomfortable about not liking their aspirational food.  Then the guy with the bread appeared. It was like they hired the Hunchback of Notre Dame to schlep bread from table to table. I wasn't expecting a model, but this guy looked like he was in a work-release program. Watching him limp to the table and speak through his snaggle teeth was too much.  I was not the only diner made to feel bad. The same gal who had the water spilled on her earlier informed the waiter that she wanted to cancel the desserts for her table. The Front of House Manager intervened and said he would have to talk to the kitchen.  He came back and guilted them into getting their unwanted desserts because the kitchen had already fired them. Mr. Dense could not seem to grasp that the poor woman just wanted to end her dining ordeal. As soon as the woman said she wanted to cancel the desserts, they should have been thrown into the garbage. As the evening progressed, more and more tables tried to cancel their desserts because the meals were so drawn out. Every time, they were either guilted into waiting for the unwanted desserts at their tables or having them packed in uber-elaborate doggie bags.  By the time our disappointing desserts arrived, I was just glad to be at the end of this mediocrity marathon.    The final tab for this cluster?  Just shy of $500 for two. If Binkley's was in a metro area with true fine dining like L.A or San Francisco, this place would already be shuttered.   So we left and I assumed we could put this whole terrible experience behind us. A few days later my phone rang and it was Binkley's calling. I was informed that the Chef noticed that I had issues with the food (implying that I just didn't appreciate his faux haute cuisine).  I declined to book another reservation (on my own dime).      My advice for a romantic dinner? Skip this train wreck and enjoy a superb dinner at T. Cook's at The Royal Palms. It won't be true fine dining, but you will avoid the abomination that is Binkley's.
5 Keller meets Adria meets Picasso is how I would describe the experience at Binkley's.   My bouche has never been so amused.   Chef/Owner Kevin Binkley has created his own unique and artistically presented menu, each dish looking like a work of art and tasting out of this world.  This is my new favorite restaurant.  The three of us had different tasting menus pared with wine and for each course the sommelier brought 3 different wines and explained each one to us in great detail.  In between the 5 courses we were given 10 different little taste treats, so dainty we thought there must be an army of elves in the kitchen slaving for hours to make these things. When I do a tasting menu I want to enjoy as many different tastes as possible and I was not disappointed.  I had the foie gras, duck, ono and veal and everything was cooked and presented perfectly, the duck being my favorite.   The food is great, the staff friendly and knowledgeable, everything was on time and we got to chat with the chef afterwards.  It's well worth making the trek into the boonies. Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing
4 In NYC, I would probably drop this down to three stars, but for tiny Cave Creek, Arizona, outside of Scottsdale, I think four stars is warranted.    We headed out to AZ for a mini-honeymoon and a conference Peter was attending.  Peter did his meticulous research and for my birthday dinner took me to a Douglas Rodriguez restaurant called Deseo.  We asked the manager for some more recommendations for dining in the area, and it turned out that he had worked with Binkley's, and sent us there.  Off the radar, and a half hour along cactusy single lane highways outside of Scottsdale, it is a place we never would have found without a local's help.  Daily menus change with the seasons, the ingredients, and the mood of the chef, Kevin Binkley, who is young enough to be intrepid and old enough (five years at the French Laundry directly under Keller and then several years at the Inn at Little Washington with Patrick) to understand fine dining.  Binkley takes the fine dining concept out for a spin and brings it home via the back roads, and the result is a comfortable, homey, small restaurant that can be dressed up or down.  People sat at the bar and had beers, and people came in their Sunday best to celebrate anniversaries.    The menu can be arranged in several ways, served a la carte, in full portions, or arranged in tasting menus of various combinations, paired with wines, and smaller in size.  We opted for the five course tasting menu with the cheeses in lieu of dessert ($82), and I ordered a half-bottle of Minor Viognier ($29) from their well-chosen, well-priced wine list, since Peter doesn't drink wine.  On the menu, it states that the chef can and will accomodate dietary requests, which knocked us both off our feet....low carb, vegetarian or whatever, you're in good hands, and the chef actually welcomes your challenge!  Sent home with the menu (tied in a blue satin ribbon), I can tell you what we chose, among three or four options per course:  Peter's choices: Bigeye Tuna Tartare with watermelon, edamame,l daikon, wasabi-coconut pana cotta, lotus root chips, lychee and chili oil  Soft shell crab with lime, fried green tomato, red onion marmalade, lemongrass ginger sauce  King Clip with wild asparagus, ramps, pattypan squash, roasted fingerling potatoes (we asked for those to be left off and they were), spring garlic and rouille  Ribeye steak with egg yolk ravioli, broccoli, maitake mushrooms, baby bulb onions and hollandaise  My choices:  Steak carpaccio with an heirloom tomato tart, mozzarella cream, cucumber, balsamic vinegar, basil and charred red onion  Corned beef TONGUE Reuben, with sauerkraut, thousand island "dressing", a cornichon, and french fries  Copper River King Salmon with giant gnocchi, sweet peppers, tasso ham, sea beans, orange and mustard  The same ribeye as Peter--we both had to have it.  We both had the cheeses at the end, and I can't remember all of them, but all six were outstanding.  Others have mentioned the plethora of amuses that come out prior to your courses, and while I did eventually find them a little distracting, most were very successful, with only the disco coaster presentation of a pineapple shooter failing to amuse my bouche or anything else.  Others include a house-cured beef jerky with horseradish creme fraiche, a bacon and egg puff pastry bite, a melon and basil soup shot with pancetta dust rimming the glass and a date and chorizo bite that was nothing short of heaven.  Most were savory and enjoyable.  Our food was very good, with the only failure of my meal being the overabundance of orange with my salmon.  In sauces, in segments, all over, it distracted me from the other savory elements instead of complementing it, but the salmon was delicious.  I would go into more detail about the food, since what is listed above is, in THEORY, what we were served, but in actuality was not, since Binkley is an adherent to the molecular gastronomy/Wylie Dusfresne/Adria/Michel Richard style of cooking.  It defies description, so I won't.  You'll be happy if you go with an open mind.  On our visit, there were three breads to choose from as they bring it around.  We tried a sourdough ciabatta & a cracked wheat, both extraordinary, helped not a little by Normandy butter, served room temperature in a ramekin.  Service is from the left, French style, one waiter per person, with knowlegeable servers directing traffic and helping as needed in the small space.  We were made to feel welcome and at home from the  moment we entered for our 8:15 reservation.  Young people learning the fine dining business are the norm here, servicewise, with three steady young women in black overseeing them and taking orders and discussing the wines with the diners as they are seated.  I had no problem with the youth and inexperience of the servers but Peter found it a little offputting.   Don't expect perfect French from these youngsters and you'll be satisfied, is my opinion.
4 My husband and I had been wanting to try Binkley's for quite some time and we finally had the opportunity to last week.  It wasn't the best dining experience I've ever had, nor the best in Arizona, but it was a solid and enjoyable experience.   The biggest detractor for me was the atmosphere.  Located in a strip mall like so many places you walk in and are immediately presented with all the clippings of their newspaper articles on the wall.  This isn't something I normally see at fine dining establishments.    They were also selling the artwork on the walls like they do in coffee shops....I thought that was a little odd.  For music we were treated to the sounds of smooth jazz.  I remarked to my husband at one point I felt like I was in a doctor's office waiting room.  I know that Yelp says this is a "dressy" establishment but my husband and I were definitely the only ones in "dressy" attire...the other couples were wearing nice clothes but more of a business casual nice than dressy.  I don't know, maybe its because on the East Coast "dressy" usually means a jacket is required and failing that, a tie.  Neither are required a Binkley's.  Men could wear polos if they wanted to.    The service was oustanding, everything was the way it should be.    We chose to do the 5 course tasting menu but the chef sends out about 100 amuse bouches.(How do you pluralize that?)  Some of them were really good, some were odd.  By the time we got to the pineapple water with coconut "caviar" that was served in a shot glass resting on a disk that light up I started to feel like they were trying a little too hard.    It was like "hey, look at this cool thing we do!"  For instance, I got Rocky Road ice cream for dessert and they pour melted chocolate ice cream on the plate and then pour liquid nitrogen over it to "freeze" it.  There were so many amuse bouches sent out that you left feeling it was a little overdone.  (I've never had more than one per course sent out before)  Even at the end after we had finished our desserts and were sitting with the check, they brought us out another one!     There were two themes....deconstructed and powder.  Practically everything came dusted with some sort of powder.  It started to get a little creepy, I won't lie.  And half of the dishes were deconstructed.  Which is cool but it got tired.    For the actual tasting menus that we ordered there were some hits and some misses.  The bean salad was good, the soft shell crab was fantastic.  I went with the filet mignon for my entree and it was just ok, I've had much better steak in many places.  The deconstructed Shepard's pie that came with it was very good.  My husband chose the fois gras as his cold appetizer and found it to be interesting but again, the 3 different preparations ("pudding pop", "noodle", and pistachio dusted brick) gave it that same "trying too hard" feel.  For the hot appetizer he chose the eggplant raviolis which were good. For the main course he selected the duck and wished there was more than 3 dinky little pieces of duck, especially considering my steak was of a good size and the deconstructed shepherds pie was big.  He was admittedly jealous.    With the five course tasting you get a cheese plate and a dessert, I went with the cheese plate (I wish they had more options) and he chose the fondue.   The cheese fondue was standard, again he wished  would have went with the cheese plate.   The deconstructed Rocky Road was good, the chocolate beignets could have been better, I have had better elsewhere.   Overall I do think the tasting menu is a good choice, its pretty reasonably priced.  But I would go with the 4 course next time since they bring out so many other things.  I didn't need the cheese plate AND the dessert by the end.  Binkley's is a good choice for a nice meal, I don't think I would do it for an anniversary though. Its probably more suited for a "congrats on getting into grad school" or something kind of event.
5 OK, this is more of a rebuttal than a review.  Rebuttal to TedS and his lovely name dropping of all the 'great' restaurants that he's been too.  Listen, I don't think that Binkley's is trying to be Taillevent or Enoteca Pinchiorri for that matter.  I wouldn't even say that Chef Binkley was trying to be Chef Keller at Per Se and the French Laundry.  All of these restaurants are amazing in their own right.  It is a shame that TedS had this bad experience, but maybe his expectations were built on hype versus actual food.  Granted, I've only eaten here once but the meal was amazing.  I wouldn't say that it was Per Se or Enoteca Pinchhiori amazing, but it was amazing in its own right.  I think that Chef Binkely is doing all of the right things and putting together the best dining experience in the state at this time.  OK, we all have off nights, and they always happen when some hopped up critic wants to compare you to Guy Savoy.  Get over it.  From a progressive dinner standpoint, the menu was thoughtful, creative and at times awe inspiring.  Excellent wine pairing (with the exception of a corked tokaj, which the sommellier was quick to replace) that matched perfectly with the food.  We even asked for a refill on one course and it was granted without charge.  Hands down, the best dining experience in AZ at this time 'that I have tried'.  I won't blast out my dining/culinary cred to make my point, but I'm here strictly to nullify TedS's rating.  You all should know that Binkley's is worth the try.
5 This place is phenomenal.The food not only is scrumptious but can be a real work of art. I also love Café Bink.
4 Ah... Binkley's. What can I say.  As a Chef, I'm was almost required to eat here, due to the fact that this place takes my craft to the next level.  I had the chef's tasting menu. It was 5 courses on paper, but with all of the little freebies and treats thrown in between courses, I think I had 12 or so.   The creativity of the food is borderline genius, yet at same time not over thought. It had elements of "aww..how cute" and elements of "holy dog fuck, this is good!".   I enjoyed my dinner with the wine tasting service that complimented each course. I will say though. some of their wine offerings were a bit mundane and talked up a little too much by the sommelier. Serving a Port I can get at Fry's for $11 a bottle with my dessert isn't something to boast about.  Can't bullshit a bullshitter, but luckily I was in a festive mood and felt like being treated like a guest so I kept my mouth shut,   This is the kinda place to soak in all of the stimulation. Your eyes, nose, tongue and brain will be stroked.   Service was tight, and it better be for the amount of money being dropped. Chef Binkley is almost always on the line, watching every plate go out his kitchen window.  The Menu changes quite regularly with seasonal food being the focus.   I'd recommend this place as a special occasion spot. Save up your pennies and venture out to Cave Creek.
5 I wanted to save my 150th review for a special restaurant & that honour goes to Binkley's. After the marvellous meal I had at Kai, it was hard to imagine anywhere else in Phoenix being as good but thanks to Phoenix Yelpers, I was pointed in the direction of this little gem  Binkley's is definitely a destination restaurant as it's located in the little town of Cave Creek 40 minutes drive north of Phoenix. However, it is aiming at the high end of the market and culinary experience. It reminds me of The Fat Duck in England, which is a 3 Michelin star restaurant located in a sleepy rural village  I think the phrase to sum up the dining experience at Binkley's is joie de cuire. You can sense the pure joy & excitement of discovering new tastes, textures, temperatures & combinations of food in the dishes that come out of the kitchen & as other diners have noted, these little explosions of flavour are most prominent in the numerous amuse bouches that arrive regularly through the meal. It's as if they're using the regular courses you order to draw you into the restaurant so they can share these little culinary discoveries. This molecular gastronomy style of playing & experimenting with food is also very reminiscent of The Fat Duck - if you enjoy the food at either place, you should try to eat at the other restaurant. If you prefer meat & 2 veg (British phrase!), this may not be the place for you  I love the great flexibility in customising your choice of menu with the different combinations of tasting menu available. 5/6 dishes on the menu change daily depending on the ingredients available  On arrival, I was offered a seat at the counter or table & I chose a table to better view the drama of the restaurant. It wasn't til later that I noticed a large hatch through which chef Kevin Binkley was able to keep an eye on the dining room & it was good to be able to have a chat to him at the end of my meal. Service was efficient & I was impressed that the chief server took over service at my table when I showed a geeky interest in the food & culinary techniques used in its preparation  Here was my culinary extravanganza. The flavour & presentation of the food was top notch & there was a hint of drama and a few surprises with most of the dishes. I hope my descriptions can convey the playful inventiveness of the kitchen  1. Arugula vichycoisse with white truffle oil. Mmm... everyone should try white truffle oil, which is a real concentration of earthy umami flavour  2. Serrano ham cream with breadstick. Great ham flavour & I wanted more!  3. Frozen melon dots - watermelon, canteloupe & honeydew with prosciutto powder. You could clearly taste the different flavour of each melon  4. Sweet potato, ginger & prosciutto, all served on a steel skewer with lovely maple froth. Unexpected combination of ingredients and it worked!  5. Cucumber, salmon mousse, quail egg a& cornichon with crisps on the side. Another lovely unusual combinatio  6. 3 types of potato fried at 3 different temperatures, served with salsa verde, bean dip & aoili. Lovely and light  7. Pina colada shot, served on a flashing lamplight. Lovely combination of flavours  8. Duelling foie gras. The first was 'dipping dots' where torchon like foie gras was dropped into liquid nitrogen & served with passionfruit. The second was a foie gras milkshake. I have never eaten foie gras like this before!  9. Pork belly with 3 preparations of watermelon - gelee, fresh & puree, with watercress sauce. I love pork belly and I love watermelon but would never have believed that they could be served together so successfully  10. Pork rillette served with pickled vegetable for sweet and sour contrast to cut though the wonderfully rich pork. Accompanied by carrot foam & powder  11. Mozarella cream poured over bacon & garlic confit. I had to check my terrible doctor's handwriting in my notebook twice to be sure of this combination but it's accurate! And I've written yum next to it!  12. Glazed sweetbreads with macadamia & bok choy. I found the glaze a little too sweet for me & detracted from the creamy sweetbread  13. Bacon & egg vol au vent with the most beautifully cooked duck egg (sous vide, I later discovered)  14. Hamachi with deep fried skin (becomes like pork crackling, which I love). Accompanied by a delicate saffron cream & cippolini onions, fried grits, fava bean and lobster mushrooms  15. Guava sobet palate cleanser  16. Roasted tenderloin of veal & divine unctuous braised cheek done in molasses and chilli oil, eggplant puree and zuchinni. The meltingly tender cheek just fell off the fork  17. Essence of lemon in 2 preparations (sorry - couldn't read notes!)  18. Meringue with root beer centre & popping powder  19. Choc milkshake with balsamic & a choc ball with liquid orange centre  20. Huckleberry - foam in liquid nitrogen, peanut butter sandwich & fresh with vanilla cream  This is an amazing culinary extravaganza
5 I was here back in January with a couple who had always raved that this was a special place and I would say it lived up to their billing and then some.  I counted 14 different amuse-bouches served individually and in bunches during the 5 course meal.   I actually felt that the $82 per person was a bargain compared to some of my dining experiences other places (of course they have to pay much higher rents since Binkley's location is quite unassuming.)  I have to say that I will be visiting Binkley's every time I visit the Boulder's.
5 Hubby took me out for my birthday here and I must say it was one of the best meals we have had since moving here from Chicago.  We had a martini at the bar and had been eyeing what the people next to us were eating (ok. I was the one eyeing but lets continue with the story...) when the man looked at us and said "Do you guys like Foie Gras?  The one we just had is the best on the planet".  Well, I LOVE Foie Gras.  and he didn't even save me a bite  8)  We sat down and ordered the 6 course tasting menu paired with wine -- everything was just amazing.  There were also some amuse buche's in between so it was way more like 12 mini courses and there wasnt one I didn't like.  The wines the sommelier paired with each were perfect.  At one point they brought a tiny thing on a plate and the waiter said "this is your Eggs and Bacon course".  It looked like a tiny egg mcmuffin from Lillyput.  we popped it in our mouth and OMG -- Eggs and Bacon.  My husband just laughed and said "Wow that was CRAZY!!"  They told us the menu changes very frequently depending on whats fresh and the chef's whim.  Oh, and I did have the foie gras and it was very amazing...  No doubt to do this place whole hog will cost you a pretty penny but it will be a penny you'll remember for a very long time.  I'm trying to figure out what we can celebrate next to make our next reservation!!
5 Hands down the most phenomenal food experience thusfar in my life. I have dined at numerous fine dining establishments around the world, but this takes the prize. Wow. Every bite that went into my mouth was exquisite. I would drive all the way from LA just to eat at Binkley's.   So unassuming from the outside, but what a pleasant suprise inside. The staff is extremely friendly and all well-versed in the menu and ingredients in each dish. I highly recommend doing the 4-, 5- or 6-course meal. It's not going to be a budget evening, but honestly, well-worth every penny. I am salivating just thinking about it! In addition to your course (highly recommend the steak tartare, scallops, duck, - but the menu changes frequently), you are presented with at least eight amuse bouchers ("treats from the chef") throughout the course of your meal. Oh. My. Gosh. It's amazing how in one bite you taste so many delicious flavorfuls meld together in your mouth and create this to-die-for taste! A few examples... blue cheese froth with homemade beef jerky rested on an endive leaf, potato soup with white truffle flakes and chives, homemade Italian salami with dates on a homemade sweet potato chip, deviled quail egg, etc. I can't even begin to describe the tastes...   I highly HIGLY recommend Binkley's for an amazing food experience. Don't forget to try their homemade potato chips and bread! Enjoy!
5 I was looking for something a little different to celebrate a coming out party of sorts for my shiny new gf.  I have always been curious about Binkley's and now had the perfect excuse to go- s.o. is a foodie.  Ho.  Lee.  Crap.    I don't really know that much about food, except that when the good stuff hits my mouth my whole body wants to throw a party for it.  Chef Binkley constantly outdid himself with most of our courses.  I am not going to to give you the bite by bite, but I would feel remiss as a budding yelper if I didn't point out a few of the tastiest moments.  BTW- we went with the 5 course taster and wine pairing.  While most of the food all night was, at best f-ing fantastic, it was at its worst, still interesting.  However, the winner-winner was not, in fact, the chicken dinner, rather the risotto.  Somewhat deconstructed, super tasty and it had these little pieces of candied bacon that takes the greatest food group to a whole new level.  Second place was my perfectly cooked fish.  Rounding out the podium was the carmel-corn dessert, where the carmel presented must know the bacon's stylist.  The rest was literally a blur of deliciousness.  To say that my date looked stunning was an understatement, but what happened to her about 3/4s of the way through the meal was both hilarious and grounds for a michelin star.  She slipped into a grinning food coma that literally alarmed the staff and probably our fellow diners.  I swear the sommolier asked twice if she was ok, and was met by a somewhat garbled mix of words to the effect of "food...heaven...uhhghh...risot....oohh..yes I am GREAT"  Not tipsy- just physically rattled by the barrage of yummy food.  I have to wrap this up because I must get back to the job that allowed this, oh $300 dollar meal (worth every penny) possible!
2 I have now been twice to Binkley's and have decided this place is so not worth it. Located in what once was the Jackalope Cafe in a strip mall location the interior has changed little from the former buildout. The food is interesting and very expensive but fails to deliver. Everything is beautiful to look at but disappointing on flavor and preparation. My wife and I did the full tasting menu and enjoyed many of the offerings but the main entrees were not good. Striped Bass was overcooked, smelled not very fresh and was served on top of a tasteless vegetable broth. Rib eye ordered medium rare was nearly raw and flavorless. We were glad we did not order the special Kobe Beef priced at $30 per ounce. Desserts are perhaps the low point of Binkley's. Corn with popcorn and bacon in some kind of sauce was bland and tasteless. Other desserts with multi layers of whipped cream and additives seemed like much ado about nothing. A first class pastry chef is needed here. On our previous visit we did a wine tasting menu sponsored by a Nappa winemaker with not much wine to be had. If you go for the food show spectacular there is nothing like Binkley's in Arizona. If only they could live up to their own reputation.
5 Hello lover. Binkley's was easily the best restaurant we dined at during our impressive Scottsdale culinary tour. Molecular gastronomy has been a huge evolution at Chicago restaurants and Chef Binkley's impeccable menu was executed to perfection. It was pretty clear that he had trained under Thomas Keller at the French Laundry. However, Kevin Binkley deserves his own praise as we could see him feverishly working in the open kitchen like Van Gogh stroking a masterpiece.   The restaurant is quaint and you will want to book a seat far out to enjoy this feast. You can go a la carte or choose a few courses for a prix fixe. You probably don't need too many courses, unless you are really starving. We chose the four courses, which were plenty.   First courses for us were Five Spice Cured Salmon -baby bok choy, orange, sugar snap peas, kiwi, taro root chips, licorice and Pasta Salad - lemon tortellini, baby artichoke, olives, fava beans, tomato tartare, mozzarella, basil. It was evident early on that we were in for a treat. Salmon and mozzarella were thinned out like papperadelle and it took me some time to realize it. Every single ingredient was fresh and tasty and the dishes were fantastic. This would be an ongoing theme for the night.   Hot apps we enjoyed were Chanterelle Mushroom Vol-au-vent-asparagus, pearl onions, butter poached chanterelles, Serrano ham and Soft Shell Crab -radish, fried green tomato, pepper jelly, horseradish. I get soft shells whenever I see them and this was great. It came with a horseradish foam! It was not only really cool, but a perfect complement to my perfectly prepared crustacean.   Our main courses were Spearfish - roasted pineapple, edamame, water chestnuts, Fresno chile, mango-guava bubble tea and Duck - breast, leg, nectarine, macadamia nuts, jalapeño, broccoli. My wife's fish came with a shake like concoction and my duck had a tasty little confit treat that was kind of like a General Tso's. So scrumptious.   We finished with a couple of excellent deserts that escape my recollection, but were certainly great. We were also treated to a bombardment of creative and delectable amuses that arrived at every turn. I lost count after about a dozen of these fantastic treats that showed off the skill and creativity of a true culinary artist. A particular highlight was the "lava lamp" of fruity shake served atop a hockey puck looking thingy that lit the whole shot glass like drink up.   Service was spot on and the atmosphere of the restaurant was lively and romantic.  Chef's wife Amy runs a tight ship in the dining room and someone is always there to help or let you know what is gracing your plate.    An unequivocal treat! This is the reigning champ of our culinary tour. Bravo Chef Binkley!
5 We just had THE best meal we have ever had in Phoenix and perhaps the best meal we've had in the US.  We arrived to a personalized menu wishing us a happy anniversary. Awesome touch!    We both got the 5 course tasting menu. Amazing but with the amount of Amuse Bouches it was a tad too much food. I had the wine parings and shared with my husband. Excellent wine choices.   Apparently every 10 days the menu is completely changed.  Haven't seen a cheese selection this good since a trip to France.  Our favorites were Rack of Lamb with a sweetbread pierogi, prosciutto wrapped tuna/watermelon with avocado. One Amuse Bouche was a serrano ham cream. Awesome! Dining here is the most unique dining experience you'll ever have. Bacon in the dessert?? Bring it on!  Worth every penny and while from the outside it looks like a crappy strip mall the decor inside with the mountain view lit up by the Phoenix city lights is stunning.  Impeccable service.
5 I have to pay tribute to chef Binkley for unknowingly taking up the challenge of introducing my fussy parents to the world of fine dining on our holiday to the USA in May  My parents enjoy good food but had rarely ventured outside their comfort zone of Chinese and Indian food and coming from Malaysia, haute cuisine is very alien to them and it takes a lot to convince them about new experiences.  Having dined at Binkley's before and being taken up by its charming and friendly atmosphere and fun side to its food with flexible menus, I chose this restaurant to take on the challenge.  My idea was that the many little bites and amuses would offer little bursts and explosions of flavour and at least some would hit home.  We went with the 4 course menu though as usual, about 17 courses arrived. Well, chef Binkley came through with flying colours and my parents gave him a thumbs up - this praise is higher than that from the Michelin guide!!!!  As I was dining with my parents, I didn't have my usual notebook to take dining notes but there were 2 things which remain in my memory and define the genius of chef Binkley's cooking.  Firstly, he applied the sous vide cooking technique to cod, the first time I had seen it used with fish. The cod was divine!!!! Soft, moist, packed with flavour which had been sealed in with the cooking process  Secondly, one of the many extra courses was a mini souffle. Now, with most kitchens, the terror of non-rising souffles creates a sweat on the brow of many chefs but here at Binkley's, they give it as a free course. The man's either a masochistic genius or someone who is supremely confident in his own abilities  Bravo, chef Binkley!
5 Went to binkley's last Friday to celebrate my bf's birthday. It's the best dining experience ever!! I knew what the front of the house (Amy) was saying when she said that the experinece will be one of a kind. Yup.   I got a 4-course tasting menu with wine pairing and he got a 5-course menu with both fish and meat course. Before our formal first course, we already had 3 amuse bouche(s?) and a champagne to start. My first course was black truffle pasta salad. OMG, it was the best thing i've ever tasted. The salad dressing was zingy and it exploded in your mouth. Wow. His first course was red king crab, the freshest crab meat i've ever tasted as well. Needless to say, we were kinda flying by the end of the first meal.   The second course i had foie gras (paid extra $14), it was perfectly seared, paired with ice wine. I love ice wine, but this is the first time i knew that such a sweet dessert wine could be paired with a savory dish. YUMMY all the way. His second was lamb ravoli, which he said was delicious as well.  Our main course was monkfish, veal chops and moi. I think they were just ok. I was going to get pheasant, but somehow I talked myself out of chicken. I din know it was award-winning. Just my luck. By the end of our main course, we already had 8 amuse bouche. We had been constantly surprised by the thoughtfulness and creativity of chef binkley.   Finally, the dessert course: i had black trufffle fondue...and he was panacotta. I din care very much for the panacotta, but  my black truffle fondue was again delicious. Of cos, by the end of the meal, i was more than incoherent and couldnt take anymore wine :)  Overall, the staff at Binkley was amazing. They were thoughtful and attentive. The next day, they even called to asked how was our dining experience. It was by far one of the most personable dining experience with outstanding food quality and creativity!   We'll have to go back!!!!
5 Possibly my favorite restaurant anywhere.  Great food.  Super service and nice people!  My wife and I made the trek from L.A. to celebrate our 1 year anniversary there.
5 Binkley's is a beautiful restaurant nestled in the Mountains of Cave Creek AZ. My wife and I had the privilege of dining at Binkley's on our 9th wedding Anniversary and it was truly an unforgettable evening!   Here are some key notes: ~ Beautiful Decor with Wood Accents ~ Dim lighting ~ Minimal Seating (This is a good thing!!!) ~ A knowledgeable staff ~ Complimentary Amuse Bouche served through out your meal!  ~ A Well Developed and Creative Tasting Menu with Wine Pairings  Above and Beyond: ~ The restaurant created special menu's that said "Happy Anniversary to ...(our names)"   ~ Chef Binkley also sent out a complimentary dessert with a cookie Twill that said Happy Anniversary.    My favorite 3 dishes: ~ Seared Foie Gras ~ Kobe Beef Carpaccio ~ Chocolate Souffle  Chef Binkley is an incredibly innovative and talented Chef that has given us a place which embodies the definition of a Dining "Experience!!!"
2 "Too many notes!" In this case too many courses, too many ingredients, too many everything. It's no wonder they lost track of my corn allergy and could have killed me -- what a disappointment.  THE GOOD --large but not daunting wine list with excellent selections --Riedel crystal, including the beautiful decanters --barman extremely knowledgeable, flawless execution in every respect --_REAL_ Luxardo Marasche cherries imported from Italy for your Knob (Creek) Dubonnet Manhattan. oh DAMN! --Chef Kevin himself at the window to finish and present every last dish that goes out (but see below) --every course an intricate four- or six-play of subtle sophistication  THE BAD --cram every dish of every episode of Top Chef into a single evening; --HUNDREDS of ingredients across 15+ courses, 3 bites each... --I can't skim an encyclopedia in four hours either, DAMMIT! --crowded dining room means close quarters for all, especially the staff --staff's rehearsed scripts of courses' ingredients and preparations played out like an old 8-track which woobles and laarrlls distortedly from endless repetition  THE UGLY --but amidst the pageant of amuse bouche after amuse bouche, course after course, despite my phoning in, reconfirming with every bloody server and manager about my allergy, THEY SERVED ME CORN FLAKES!!!! BLOODY MOTHER OF G. D. EFFING H. E. DOUBLE TOOTHPICKS!  Did Chef think I would not notice? Did Chef even care? I must presume that they were not purposefully trying to kill me, so it has to be that the staff and the kitchen just can't keep track of it all. Don't forget that there are one thousand effing ingredients in play in each diner's meal, let alone that it says bloody CORN ALLERGY all over the effing ticket! I trusted you, Chef, and you disappointed me. And you didn't even come out yourself to take responsibility for it, you jerk!  Unfortunately I could not enjoy any of the courses which followed. I was just too damn paranoid. I gave up and asked for the corny check.  EPILOGUE I hope you can believe me when I say that I have been _dreading_ this review for weeks. It could be that my experience was just a fluke. My story is but a single snapshot. Who am I to pass judgment on such elegant art? Especially art for which Chef has obviously spent years of disciplined study and exploration.  A restaurant's sole business should be the sale of delight. Instead I left paranoid and confused. And I left having paid several hundred dollars for it! Good bye, nurse!  Unfortunately, I must concur with my esteemed colleague Ted S.: Binkley's challenges the limits of culinary excess and does so outside the bounds of its own ability to deliver. Two stars. Seven dollar signs.
5 Easily one of my favorite meals EVER! That is a big deal coming from somebody who likes food as much as me. The very best ingredients and a ton of flavor with a pile of creativity. Pricey and worth every penny. Hats off to Binkleys!
5 Wow!! Went to Binkley's last night for the Valentine's Day 6 course tasting menu and all I can say is WOW! Thank god we have this restaurant in the Valley as it is really outstanding!   The GF BF and I sat outside on the patio, which was delightful for the early seating especially because it is small and cozy with a great fireplace. There were 2 tastings for each course offered so we decided to try everything, including the wine pairings. I have to say that I could really get used to not ever having to decide what I'm going to eat...but anyway....the shear gluttony began! Course after course of heaven paired with a perfect wine really was amazing!   The chef is also extremely generous offering a large number of amuses prior to the meal even beginning! Such creative items like a mini sloppy joe, amazing steak tartare, shrimp ceviche and a mango bomb made to look like a fried egg. Truly delightful!   Some highlights from the actual 6 courses were the marlin tartare, crispy seared foie gras (divine!!), black truffle sunchoke soup (lots and lots of black truffles), seared diver scallops that melted in your mouth, ribeye cap with a red wine risotto, roasted brussel sprouts and a perfect cipollini onion, my favorite a 2 day old burrata with a poached pear and a very cool intermezzo "shot" that was distinctly a good 'ol PB&J with a little chocolate! Everything was wonderful and we really enjoyed our service as well!  We took a look at a regular menu and will definitely be back! Kevin is a fantastic chef and we can't wait to try his brilliance again!  P.S. They are super accomodating for food allergies!
5 We have been to binkley's for nearly 4 years as a couple on special occassions and taking friends; sum it up - there is no better place !!  It is all about the food - absolutely the finest ingredients, prepared with utmost skill, the featured item is always center stage and the sauces that accompany it take it to heavenly heights.  No one does foie gras any better in the world.  The number and quality of amous bouches that you get is incredible and it reflects a certain class and respect for clients that is way above any one else.   Every time we go it feels like we are the judges at an ' iron chef ' event. The staff are without par, they know exactly how the food is prepared, explains everything well, is always courteous, friendly and without fail.  Yeah, it may be a little bit of a drive, but we would not trade this gem for any place else. Maybe we are being a bit ' snooty ' but we are selective in who we tell about binkley's - we respect what they do too much.  We'll always be back to binkley's.
5 Went here for late birthday dinner with my partner. Our birthdays are one day apart and the evening started with personalized menus with happy birthday wishes on them. A most unusual series of little surprises between courses - like mini mini sloppy joe, mini breakfast muffin, little melon yokes - all very creative and well presented. The tasting menu is a must - the wine pairings were great too. Service was attentive and helpful. Overall, yes it was expensive, but well worth it compared to comparably priced places in the area. This place is in my all-time top 5. Be sure to book well in advance and ask for indoors or outdoors depending on your preference.
1 They chose not to honor a $200 gift certificate we gave our parents over a year ago. My parents winter in Scottsdale, and my father called last spring to make sure they would take the gift certificate when he and my mom returned this year. When asked why they changed their minds, the female Binkley's employee stated, "We felt we were being taken advantage of."
5 All the stars for food, service and surprises.  We drive 90 miles to dine at Binkley's and almost always go with the tasting menu and wine pairing.  The wines chosen with each course add a new dimension to the experience of he food, something I would be lucky to achieve unles I was totally familiar with the cellar, and I'm not.  Between courses, Chef Kevin sends out an array of 'amuses bouches' that are imaginative, flavorful and occasionally a little showy, but a sense of humor is not a bad thing in a restaurant, especially one with its foundations in the classic French style.  Having Binkley's 90 miles away has tempered my need to dine at the French Laundry in Napa Valley where Kevin picked up a few inspirations.
4 Everyone should go to Binkley's at least one.  You should go at least as much for the experience as you do for the food.  We tried the 4 course tasting menu with wine paring and it was quite enjoyable.  They made a production out of each of the courses as well as when the wine steward presented each of the wines.  In addition to the for courses they presented (served does not seem an appropriate word to use) several interesting small appetizers before and after each of the main courses.  The fine china, the fine crystal, the, the linen napkins, the personalized menus, all made it quite an evening.  As far as the food goes this is a foodies paradise.  The menu is unlike any you will find anywhere else and the way the food was presented was very creative.  It was almost like going to a food art museum.   The main courses looked and tasted great.  I'm glad we did it.  Why only 4 stars you ask?  Because I don't think we will be going back.  I am not the person who watches a show, no matter how great it is, more then once.  When you separate the show from the food you find that the show is what is the most impressive and I have already seen it.  The food and wine alone do not justify the $150 per person it costs and since I have already seen the show it is no longer worth it to me.  That said you need to go at least once because it is a total experience you will not forget.
5 oh my goodness.  Fantabulous, fantastic, out of this world.  The food was incredible and the combinations that is served is unique.  there is no other restaurant like this in Arizona.  the service was wonderful, the food was wonderful, the wine list was not your everyday wine list so the suggestions they offered according to our taste....perfect.  there is not one item on that menu not worth having.  there were 8 of us this evening and we all ordered something different such as the 4 course.  oh  my goodness.  well, my favorite was the soft shell crab.  out of this world.  there is not enough I can say to make somene try it except, see for yourself.   You cannot be disappointed.
2 The GF and I have heard so many good things about Binkley's over the years from people that we know that have dined there and from reading reviews online. We finally decided that we had to try it to see how it stacked up against Kai, which is our favorite restaurant in the PHX area. I made reservations for Friday night of Memorial Day weekend a little over a week in advance. Since Binkley's is about 35 miles from the neighborhood that we both live in, we decided to make a weekend of it and stay at The Boulders. The week leading up to the meal, we were both so excited that we both joked that we were getting very little work done due to the anticipation of the amazing meal we were going to have on Friday night.  Friday finally came and we arrived right on time for our 7p reservation. We were promptly greeted by the hostess and promptly seated at the absolute worst table in the house. It was in the bar area, right next to the front door. The most insulting part of it was the hostess tried to tell us what an amazing table it was because the vases of flowers that separated our table from the front door were so pretty. In the grand scheme of things, not a big deal if you wow us with the food. After all, we knew from many reviews that atmosphere is not the strong selling point of the restaurant.  After we were seated, we waited for a good 15 minutes before being greeted by a server. This is one of my pet peeves in a fine dining establishment. I like to be greeted promptly by the server and offered a cocktail so I can enjoy a drink while reviewing the menu. Once we were finally greeted we ordered cocktails and enjoyed them when they were finally served. Being that this was our first Binkley's experience, we both decided that we would go "whole hog" and order the 6 course tasting menu with the $50/ea wine pairing. As has been mentioned in may other reviews online, a meal at Binkley's consists of a long parade of amuses. Sadly, in a meal of more misses than hits, the amuses provided more of the hits.  The big hit of the night was the summer truffle grits that the GF ordered as her hot appetizer. Both of us agreed that these were amazing. Unfortunately, most everything else was relatively forgettable (her halibut fish course was absolutely boring). My quail meat course was quite good, but not something that I would drive 35 miles to experience again.  Throughout the night, the service and the pacing was uneven. Sometimes there was a very lengthy time between courses while other courses were brought to quickly. While our main server was perfectly friendly, she lacked fine dining polish and disappeared for long periods of time (especially when it was time for the check!) several times over the course of the evening.  As for the wine pairings, those were also hits and misses. The pourings themselves were quite anemic and with long times between courses, there were several times that I had finished my pour before the course even arrived. For a total of $100 between the two of us, I felt the wine was a weak spot in the evening.  The most entertaining part of the meal was the Gordon Ramsay-esque, f-bomb laced tirade that Chef Binkley went on at some point during the meal. Apparently his kitchen staff wasn't doing things his way and he was letting them know. Quite comical, although a little uncomfortable to other diners around as we could clearly hear every word that he screamed at his staff.  When all was said and done, we spent a little over $400 with tip for dinner. While it certainly wasn't the worst meal of either of our lives, we both agreed that it didn't even come near cracking the top 20. We were both glad that we dined at Binkley's to have the firsthand experience, but we both left feeling that it was overrated. Perhaps they were having an off night, maybe it has slipped over the years, or maybe it's just a victim of being over-hyped. Whatever the case, I don't think we will be dining at Binkley's in the future.
5 We had an 8 course dinner on New Years Eve 2010 ,they bent over backwards accommodating Vegetarian Foodie Brat Moi and my Non Vegetarian BF.It was one of the best meals Ive had anywhere in my limited World Travels.I wish I could go into the complexity of the courses,but too hard to explain, esp. since I left the Menu in AZ, & much Champagne was consumed, affecting memory function. I do know it was Dang Amazing, & Dang Spendy, & I am so Humbled & Unworthy.Insert Catholic Guilt here!!! My courses had to throw off the whole planned tasting menu, but they could not have been nicer about the additional work I caused,& I think I had the best courses of anyone there. We sat outside with a view of the AZ Topography, & it was so perfect, Magical. I Swear I heard Angels playing harps & I could hear God Breathing Blessings on my New Upcoming Year.Yep, that Fantabulous!!!He, the Fella that is, really made some Brownie Points for taking me somewhere so Special & Expensive for New Years Eve. You think he wants payback?  Oh Binkley's you took me to the Brinkly of Perfection, now how am I to Top that next year?  5 out of 5 Tiara's Binky Baby
5 Wonderful food, attentive service.  Go.
5 If one had asked me 10 years ago if I'd ever eat somewhere with the caliber and focus of an institution like Binkley's, I would have pondered for a minute and probably responded only if it was by the desire and grace of a girlfriend's sufficiently endowed parents or a reception catered by the Google Gillionaires I would surely be surrounded by as a result of a blossoming interest in the tech industry. If one had asked if I'd ever be there at the suggestion of my family who would be equally, if not more, at home at Claimjumper, I wouldn't have deigned the question worthy of response at all.  I would have been (at least temporarily) wrong.  At the behest of a curious mother living nearby for years, we ventured. Unassuming from the exterior in a strip mall with such high end boutiques as Enterprise Rent-A-Car and sharing a zip code with a cowboy tourist targeted bar that features bull riding of the non-mechanical variety, Binkley's is a tiny destination restaurant that seems slightly uncomfortable with its surroundings, and we were equally slightly out of place with our sinusoidal experience not for control freaks:  - Greeted by name due to party size and expected arrival time being unique resulted in feeling like VIPs confused by their own fame - Sending away the sommelier a bit dejected when we unanimously declined wine - Realizing our head waitress was a bizarro version of a friend from back home - Opting for the highest end 5-6 course tasting menus ($82 - $89, wine pairing $40-50 extra) like non-confused VIPs, but skipping the foie gras surcharge (+$14) - Being thankful of no collective food restrictions or allergies to impede chef creativity - Impressed by a nearly endless train of experimental amuse-bouches - Processing that we were 3-4 courses in without seeing anything we ordered - Recalling that some of us were no stranger to this dining style when it's called omakase, except then there's no illusion of input into the majority of the meal - Hitting our stride with the hot appetizer, including a superb soft shell crab course - Enjoying the best black cod I've ever eaten in a sea of unusual but not quite as enjoyable candidates - Starting to feel full around the penultimate course, an amuse of chocolate souffle  - Understanding without bitterness that soda refills were not free ($2.50) despite the staff's complete lack of hesitation in providing them - Taking home satisfaction levels ranging from grudgingly enjoying the expensive dinner show to thinking it was the best overall food experience in months if not years  Menu guidance would be a futile endeavor since, as the head waitresses helpfully informed all non-returnee tables, it turns over completely around every two weeks. However, overall, the seafood dishes were stronger than those with meat, of interest if one is opting for a menu with a single main. Instead:  - Prepare for the onslaught of Kevin Binkley's culinary whims - Pretend the a la carte menu doesn't exist - Make a reservation well in advance, especially for a weekend - Bring your wallet, possibly two - Expect to spend at least 3 hours luxuriating over the meal - Sigh longingly while realizing how far in the future the next justifiable visit will be  Regardless of apprehension, except in the face of a diet with statistically outlying strictness, it's worth trying once for a special occasion to form one's own opinion. While I could easily think of a number of small tweaks, the application of the formulaic main draw is, in Yelp's terms, semantically indistinguishable from as good as it gets.
5 This review is an extremely long time coming as I only ate here once and it was way back in June of '09 so bear with me! I might not ever eat here again either, but only because I wasn't the one paying the 1st time and I prefer not to know what the final bill came to. Having said that, this was the most insane (in a good way) experience I've had eating a meal in my life! I was there with family celebrating a birthday and my family member happened to be very good friends with the Sous Chef, which is basically why we went. We are not your usual fine dining crowd and I think my experience here was a healthy dose of pretending I was a judge on Iron Chef and actual, honest-to-goodness good food and excellent service. We all ordered the tasting menu, with minor variations so we covered our bases. Everything I ate was wonderful and I walked away completely stuffed. We were there for something like 3 hours and by the time we left I was like "wha? where have I been? food heaven?!"  Ok, silliness aside the food was excellent and the staff was incredible. They did have their schtick down with their food presentation but they were also good sports and looked like they were having fun. If you feel like going all out for a special occasion (or if you just always have lots of cash to throw around) this is definitely a place to consider. I will be back once I win the lottery!
5 The best restaurant!  Truly amazing!!!
2 I am not a Binkley's fan.  I know ... Kevin Binkley was recently nominated for a James Beard, Howard Seftel awarded it 5 stars, but really, it is overrated, overpriced and a just a little more than tired.  Thankfully, the whole deconstrution and molecular gastronomy craze seem to be disappearing from menus. Truthfully, when dining out, I appreciate beautiful fresh ingredients prepared simply without the pretense. When did food have to become so technical that it resembles a high school chemistry lab assignment more than a meal? Meals at Binkley's are exhausting and often comical.  They are orchestrated more as performing art than as a meal to be enjoyed.  Having previously dined at Binkley's on several occasions, I will not be driving the 20 miles to Cave Creek. The restaurant is in a seedy, run down strip mall, cost hundreds of dollars, and when finished, all we really want to do is stop on the way home and have a burger because we are still hungry.
2 I have been to Binkley's a couple of times now to experience their multi-time, James Beard Award winning dinning experience and walked away thinking; either my pallet is completely unrefined and I need new glasses or the peeps that awarded Kevin Binkley his award must have had a few to many cocktails prior to their dinning experience.    The food was very good but really... two bites?  Come on!  I can go just about anywhere and eat just two bites and think their food tasted good.  It's the whole meal people are wanting to experience and not just the baby bites you are creating.  Please put some time and energy into cooking the rest of the dish and let's see if your molecular gastronomy - culinary offerings are James Beard worthy then.   The wine was exceptional.  I do appreciate the fresh ingredients your prepare and find your plating whimsical yet comical unfortunately at my expense...  After the multi course of spoon tastings and bite sized hors d'oeuvre's we left with a $250 bill for two.  No worries, I had a $200 gift certificate this time from a friend that wanted me to experience Binkley's one more time just to show me that I do in fact need new glasses and my pallet needs more refining.    They chose not to honor my $200 gift certificate due to my certificate was just over 12 months old...  Let's see, you cashed the money you were paid for a certificate to dine at your establishment but you won't honor it now and potentially win my business going forward?   If your looking for a place that has a fantastic wine list, obtusely unique, expensive and self indulging then this is the place for you.
5 This restaurant is not for those of you who eat for the sake of consuming food, or for people who fill your mouth with food then swallow out of the sheer nature to feed oneself. Save your money and go to Harolds, and have fries in your salad.  This dining experience is artfully prepared, intellectually porportioned, and if you choose the pairing menu...Amazing!   Ok, so this is how i experience these little tid bits of heaven...first you start off with a Grey Goose Martini, dry, with blue cheese stuffed olives. Then choose from the pairing menu.  Now you are ready for your tastebuds to have a party!  As these incredible morsels are served, and your tastebuds have their first encounter, make yourself aware of the flavor changing as the  make their way across your tongue. Close your eyes and feel the texture, taste the intricate balance of flavors. It's truly amazing how the flavors behave on your pallet.  By the end of the fourth course, and wine parings, you will be wondering how in the world you can make room for desert.    Oh wow that was wonderful!  21/2 -3 hours have passed, you thank the Chef and the competent staff who were incredibly attentive all night. You now go have a party at home with your significant other!
5 One of the best food experiences I have ever had. It's a must for any real foodie.
5 Happy birthday to me!  I celebrated early this year... with a 19 course meal at Binkley's.  Yes... I am serious.  We literally had 19 courses in about 3.5 hours, and it flew by!  I had great company with my husband and our friends from Charlotte.  The staff at Binkley's was totally on it; paying attention to detail with a personalized "Happy Birthday Gabi" on our menus and ridiculous (in a good way) service from Rebecca, our waitress and a handful of supporting cast members.  They were like ninjas, replacing fresh rolled napkins in ribbon, each time any of us got up to use the restroom.  I chose the four course tasting menu and a single glass of wine.  I was the designated driver for the night... go figure!  The other three in our group went with the four and five course meals paired with wine.  Instead of breaking down each person's meal, I'll simply review my own.  Sit back and relax because there is plenty of food to tell you about.  Here goes:  -amuse bouche #1 - sherry scented duck consomme -amuse bouche #2 - chicken liver mousse served with a rye crostini, whole grain mustard, caper berry, brandy gelee, pickled pear onion, and egg mousse -amuse bouche #3 - flash frozen fruit cocktail - this was delicious! -cold appetizer - red king crab (by the way, they brought out the crab alive prior to serving it)... it was served with roasted baby beets, sea beans, shaved fennel, cornbread croutons, sawagani crab, yuzu zabaglione -amuse bouche #4 - miniature sloppy joe -amuse bouche #5 - buttermilk bread pudding -amuse bouche #6 - pommes souffle with seven dipping sauces - mmmmm! -amuse bouche #7 - basil and chevre mousse, vol-au-vent served with a dehydrated tomato, red pepper coulis, and red pepper powder -amuse bouche #8 - pomegranate bomb served with mango, ver jus- (another favorite of ours) -hot appetizer - charred shrimp - black beans, fresno chile, bean sprouts, cilantro, and an orange lentil dahl -amuse bouche #9 - mint chocolate chip shot with a mint consumme (not may favorite but it was served on an LED light - kind of cool!) -nantucket bay scallops served with gnocchi, chorizo, corn, avocado, and confit tomato (great choice) -amuse bouche #10 - bubblegum and lemon passion fruit lollipops -amuse bouche #11 - strawberry souffle served with a banana creme anglaise -amuse bouche #12 - vanilla whipped cream with a candied mint leaf - oooh; one of our favorites -brown sugar polenta - amazing dessert! (I also sampled the cheese fondue and the cheese plate which were pretty fabulous also) -amuse bouche # 13, 14, and 15 - pistachio merengues, apricot pate, chocolate brownie with a violet buttercream icing.  We all left more than full and happy, but that didn't stop any of us from taking the homemade candied nuts on the way out.  Binkley's is definitely a unique foodie experience to be cherished for special occasions.  I can't wait to celebrate there again soon!
5 Expensive, but one of the most imaginative meals you will ever have.  Definitely worthy of a special event.   This chef also has the Carefree restaurant Cafe Bink.  Here you will have excellent food with a less expensive menu.
3 Enjoyed an extremely tasteful meal here recently. However, was very disappointed in lack of attention by our main server - took food and drink order and never checked on us until time to bring out the check. Also disappointed we weren't given one of the menus with our Happy Anniversary wishes written at the top....have been told by others they got to take it home. Informed management of all the above on a follow up call...to no avail.
4 My checking account is grateful for Binkley's location, but my taste buds are not.  I ate here for one of my best friend's 25th birthday, and we consumed nearly 30 courses. I would highly recommend ordering the tasting menu, primarily because the bonus courses blew the main courses out of the water. Although smaller, the bonus courses packed  punches in terms of flavor, and creativity. Binkley's sure knows how to tease your palette with the surprise courses.   Here are some highlights of the night: White truffled deviled quail egg Bite of sloppy Joe Pommes with dip Mangalitsa pork Charcuterie Plate with perfect foie gras, and egg yolk mousse.   I won't spoil the rest for you, but I would say everyone has to go here once. Thanks to Francisco Salter, we had an amazing experience!
5 If there is a heaven, Binkley's is the restaurant that is featured. By far the most amazing meal of my life. It was so amazing that we made a detour on our trip to come back a week later. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.   The only way to experience Binkley's to the fullest is to have their tasting menu with the wine accompaniment. It is out of this world. The first time I went I got the 6 course tasting menu, which in actuality is 30 courses and about 4 hours of eating and drinking.  Some of the highlights:  - Tater tot with cheese foam - Pomegranate bomb  - Crab appetizer (crab cooked three different ways) - Roasted Sunchoke Soup - Miniature sloppy joe - Cheese fondue - Halibut   - Bread puddin  The second time ( a week later) I got the 5 course tasting menu with wine, which in actuality is 20-25 courses and about  3.5 hours of eating and drinking.  Some of the highlights:  - Shrimp Ceviche - Three Temperature Steak Tartare - Green apple bomb - Périgord Black Truffle & Wild Mushrooms en Papillote - Ivory King Salmon - Mint chocolate chip shot with a mint consumme - Strawberry souffle served with a banana creme anglaise - Pumpkin Pie Pannacotta   Both times at Binklley were amazing--the service is impeccable, the food is heaven in your mouth and the atmosphere is elegant.   I will be making special trips to Cave Creek, AZ just for Binkley's. This is a foodies paradise!
2 It's OK. It's not great but, it's not a train wreck. It is at the low end of good for a restaurant in it's price range. The food is interesting in description and OK in taste. Actually, some items are awesome and others are just bad, averaging the total taste experience out to OK.   The plating may be one of the best qualities of Binkleys. If you are wowed by amuse-bouche on large plates, you will be tripping over yourself with praises.  The staff is polite but a little affected. Their approach is magnified by the decor/style of Binkleys which is reminiscent of a buffet style restaurant in the Midwest.   In my opinion, the five star reviews on Binkleys are using the same rating scale the reviewers use to evaluate their local burger shop. Unless your burger dinner costs you up to $250 a person (the price of my dinner), it's the wrong scale. The food+experience just is not there.   On a positive note, their bacon bourbon is delicious and worth the trip on it's own...but, stop there. If you dare proceed ahead, avoid the jerky like meat(s) and stick with seafood dishes - they are less of a jaw workout.
5 Excellent meal. We are foodies an this was one of the best meals we ever had anywhere. Best in Arizona. We think it is a level above Kai in service and food. We had the six course tasting with wine. A superb experience.
5 True fine dining has come to the Valley.  If you are looking to have a special dinner, this is the place.  And plan on spending 3 hours as it is a true culinary experience.  The tasting menu consists of options of 4, 5, or 6 courses, and they can be paired with wine, if you like.  This is the way to go and even for tasting portions, they are not micro-mini.  The choices for each course are extensive.  At least 6-10 each.  AND, the coolest part, is that you won't find any ingredient repeated twice.  NONE.  Yes you might find tomatoes in the same night, but they won't be the same type.  That's not easy to pull off, considering the variety of the menu.  But, while you are between courses, Chef Binkley will send out numerous amuse bouche - which, if you don't know, are tiny little one bit or one gulp appetizers like, mini sliders the size of a half dollar, or pancetta mousse in a shot glass.  We ate there for my ex-H's bday, and had 8 amuse bouche.  Also, if you let them know in advance you are there for a special occasion, you will get custom printed menus for everyone at the table mentioning the special event.  The ONLY drawback, is the atmosphere.  It definitely doesn't fit the quality and beauty of the food.  But, I still give it a 5, as the food is superb.  If you are a true foodie GO. I was excited the whole meal, as I couldn't wait to see what came out next!   If you are a meat and potatoes type with an uneducated palate, save your time and money, since you won't appreciate the menu at all.
5 This has got to be the foodie deal of the century!  Multiple options for the tasting menu, all way under $100, with wine pairing options under $50, for dishes that approach the level of, if not quite reaching, French laundry. On top of that, all the additional amuse bouches was like having two other tasting courses. I literally counted that we had 12 amuse bouches...yes, 12! And really good ones! True, most of them were truly half a bite sized, but if they were any larger, I really would have exploded. They even gave me a glass of sparkling wine to pair with an amuse bouche...I mean, who does that??  To start, the atmosphere of the restaurant is old school, and initially a bit stuffy...but the waitstaff were all extremely pleasant (as should be for this level restaurant). Throughout the meal, they do their best to be invisible, but the space is a bit small so I couldn't help noticing now and then someone intently watching us as we were finishing a plate so that they could clear it away. Having said that, there was one time that my husband got up to go to the restroom, I looked down for one second, and when I looked back a freshly tied napkin was in the place of the dirty plate that had been there. That's stealth. You can see Mr. Binkley at the service window the entire time, so you know that every dish is getting checked by him before going out...which is always gratifying to see.   If you're a bacon lover, or even if you're not but are ok with bacon, you have to try the applewood smoke bacon bourbon drink. It's amazing, and a great way to start off the evening. They serve it with a single large ice cube that fills the glass with applewood scented smoke (you can really smell it), and the bourbon really had a nice subtle smoky bacon flavor. They serve it with a garnish of sugar coated bacon on the side, which I could have done without, or would have enjoyed more if they had cut down on the sugar. It was like trying to eat a block of sugar with the bacon trapped way inside...perhaps I was supposed to stir it in the drink? Oh well, I still enjoyed it immensely.   We each chose the 5 course tasting menu that included both a meat and fish, and excluded the cheese plate. However, before our first dish, we were given an onslaught of 4 amuse bouches! A small cup of curried pear soup, a complex plate of duck pate with toast, a spoonful of chilled granita like fruit, and a miniature (I mean really mini, the size of a quarter) sloppy joe. After that, they slowed down to 1 to 2 amuse bouches between each plate. They really like to plate to dramatic effect, but it makes the whole experience more fun.  I'm not going to go into any detail about our courses since the menu changes daily, but I thought every plate was spot on. Each dish is intricately plated and though some look like works of art, others aren't quite as pretty, but still taste fantastic. There are so many ingredients to each dish, that occasionally it's a little confusing as to what might be the best way to eat it, but I often just shovel everything into my mouth, and all the flavors would complement each other. The seafood was delicate, the meats were perfectly cooked in bite size portions (the mangalitsa pork was served 3 ways on the plate). All the dollops of sauces and garnishes were flavor packed. The desserts were lovely and not too heavy.   I was pretty smashed by the end of the night, after 6 glasses of wine, but I still remember most of the evening! Having recently moved from the Bay area, and eating at some of the highly rated restaurants there, including French Laundry, this really is just as good at half the price. I will definitely be making many an excuse to eat there again. It's definitely taken away a little of the sting of having to leave San Francisco.
1 This review is about the management of Binkleys, not the food as I never got to use the $200 prepaid voucher I had for the establishment.  Having received a $200 voucher for my birthday I tried on several occasions to use it, I have two small kids and I travel a lot. On the three occasions I tried to use it they had not reservations available. One one occasion I had a reservation but had to cancel as I was sick (being fair)  I finally got a reservation and the manager called me and in a very abrupt way informed me my voucher was worthless as it had expired. Upon review the term EXP with a date is apparently the expiry date.  Given they had had the benefit of our money for over a year I thought they may be interested in honoring the voucher. NO I was informed and the neo fascist manager began to unload on me and chastise me for not being organized enough to use it.  I am pretty reasonable and it it were my place I would accommodate customers, more so if a person who prepaid, it would make sense you accommodate them with a reservation, however Binkleys stance is "we have your cash now, let's fill the place with people who are yet to pay and the idiots who prepay can wait till last"  This place may have great food but great management with a ficus on service and customers ...... NO WAY.  Mr Binkley or what ever your name is you Bilked me out of my birthday present, thank you.  I can only hope $200 worth of misfortune follows you.
5 Simply the best restaurant in the greater Phoenix area.  The foie gras was top notch, and while I have had foie gras many places, Chef Binkley just makes the best foie gras.  I am not sure if it is product, technique, or a combination, but this foie gras is something special.    Everything I have ordered here was excellent.  My wife has tried some things that don't hit perfectly with my palate, but she loves them (like tuna with wasabi.  Ingredients are always fresh, and the amuses just keep coming.  The only thing I was sad about was the people at the table next to us were getting different amuses, and theirs sounded better (foie gras empanadas, anyone?!)  I have heard plenty of people complain that there are too many small bites throughout the meal, but those people are silly. Nothing like jerkoff rich people to say "stop giving me things for free!  I hate free things!"  If you don't want it, don't eat it.  Simple as that.  People scoff at the prices, but I think it is well worth it.  If you are going weekly, then yes, this can get expensive.  But if you save up for special occasions, then this is well worth it.  I won't go through everything I had, but I will tell you that everything was great (on the winter menu).  By the end of the night, you will be rolling out of there, so bring a big appetite.  Last time I got the wine pairing with a 5-course meal, but I don't think I will do that again.  It was actually too much wine!  Next time I will opt for a cocktail or two so I don't have too much of a buzz, and I can remember the dessert courses better.
3 I went to Blinkley's last night and found that it was a good experience.  The food was well thought out from the Sous Vide book recipes.  The chefs were creative.    As a very particular eater although, my waitress was not as patient as she needed to be looking for me to rush an order.
5 We attended a rehearsal dinner there, my soon to be brother in law is a chef there on occasion. We had a 13-15 course meal. Damn good food. Great service.
2 So this restaurant has received awesome reviews by many.  Some even said "you have to try it before you die".  I planned by gf's bday party here and the pricing was outrageous.  This place is not meant for large parties, anything over 6 people.  First you have to pay for a fee to reserve either the private dining room or the outside patio; I believe it was between $1500 and $2000.  They have a preset menu which you can pick from but it does not compare to getting smaller plates with a smaller party.  You can try more and get food for what you pay for. My gripe about this place is that the filet was way over cooked.  My entire party of 20 people said the steak was tougher than a polar bear's toe nail.  Also, some of the extra appetizers were very jelloy.  I think this place is worth a try if you're around the Scottsdale area; however, the hype is way over rated and there are plenty of other restaurants that Scottsdale is known for.
4 This is by far my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area.  It's a special occasion restaurant, but the experience and service is in its own class. I went here last Saturday to celebrate my boyfriend's new job with another couple.  It was my third visit and made a full rebound from my last experience.  I have always gotten the 4 course tasting menu.  The best part about the tasting menu is that you can choose anything off the regular menu and get a lot of amuse-bouches.  I started off with the octopus, which was delicious and had an amazing presentation.  I can't describe the presentation, just that the plate was large, kinda busy, and the oils gathered in the dips of the plate.  Unfortunately, the next course, figs, was a disappointment. It was bland.  No complex flavors or any out of the world tastes I have come to expect.  The pork that was served with the figs, however, was juicy and flavorful.  The figs didn't add that much of a flavor.  The waitress sold me on the chicken(yes, chicken) for the meat course.  Sadly, it was also disappointing.  The chicken tasted slightly better than the average chicken.  After the pork that came with the figs, I was wishing I had gotten the pork tenderloin instead of chicken.  For dessert, I got the poached peach semifreddo.  It was pretty cool when they poured liquid nitrogen after setting the plate in front of me.  Quite delicious too.  I also got to sneak a bit of the bf's panna cotta.  Very sweet and also cool presentation.  Some other notes: My bf braved the wine paring and was quite satisfied.  Everyone else got foie gras and ranted about how amazing it was.  We even got a special foie gras amuse.  My favorite amuse was the tater tot served with some truffle sauce.  It totally brought out the truffle flavor and the tot was perfectly crisp.  Service has been top notch every time I've gone.  General thoughts: Food has usually been excellent every time.  Good price point.  I've always left incredibly stuffed and happy.  I do wished the wine pairing and food can be consistently excellent.  I wished I didn't remember how things were a little off the second time I was there.(Not much amuse-bouches and wine pairing was definitely subpar to the first time.  Different sommelier each time.)
5 Wow!  I am not well versed in the world of fine dining, but this was an amazing experience for me.  A group of us went to wish my brother well as he prepares to leave the country for a couple of years.  When I was told that we would have the 5-course meal, this is what I expected - 5 courses.  Nobody told me about the amuses bouches.  We started eating at about 6:15, and we had what seemed to be a never-ending procession of amazing bite-sized foods to whet our appetites.  13 in all!  There was a quarter-sized sloppy Joe (this is not your mother's sloppy Joe!); a flat, crisp bread with ricotta cheese cream made in house, a mango bomb (it looked like a broken egg in a spoon, and as soon as you put it in your mouth, the "yolk" liquified.  What I remember is being stunned at the presentation and the cavalcade of flavors and textures.  After two hours, we still hadn't even started the first course!  In between each of the first three courses, we had an intermezzo, similar to the amuses bouches.  One of them was a strawberry consomme' shot served on a color changing lighted coaster-quite a sight!  Our meal consisted of the heirloom tomatoes, sweet corn chowder, halibut (the most tender fish I have ever had), and filet mignon with preserved lemon and red wine demi-glace.  This was one of the best filets, if not the best filet that I have ever had.  I could go into the descriptions of how the courses were prepared, but it really wouldn't do them justice.  It was probably almost three hours into our experience before starting the Parade of Desserts - and a parade, it was!  We had five different desserts.  We decided to parade them ourselves so we each could try all of them.  We shared a chocolate parfait, red velvet cake, raspberry tart (definitely not the traditional presentation!), poached peach semifreddo and pannacotta.  And then, even after we had finished our desserts, they brought out a plate of tiny pieces of fudge, meringues and some kind of fruit preparation.  The meal was incredible, the presentation was a feast for the eyes and the service was outstanding!  Any time someone would get up from the table, someone was perched and ready to take the napkin and place a new napkin in its place.  Just about as soon as someone took their last bite, the plate was stealthily taken from the table.  When each course was brought, there were probably six or seven servers bringing the food to our table of 13.  The meal took well over three hours and was not rushed in any way.  This is an evening that we will all remember for a very long time.  Even as the details of the specific foods we ate begin to fade, we will remember this as a really fabulous experience!  If you have a special event in your life, this is certainly a place to consider.

5 Love this place! It generally takes 3 hours if you order from the tasting menu but the flurry of little bites between each course (about 15 total) make it go by so quick. It's a foodie's paradise!
2 So what does $122 buy for dinner these days? It buys a "tasting menu" with wines of some of the most eclectic food on the planet. Quail eggs on the same plate with a mini sloppy joe. Okay. This is another of those nouveau fine dining places that is trying to break with the traditions of the past and offer a "We're your best buddy - come into our home for dinner" concept. For atmosphere it mostly achieves that goal and is a rather warm and friendly place. Fellow diners were having a good time and the restaurant just had a good feel to it. It did not seem fake or plastic nor did I feel the staff staring at me as if they wanted to plunge a steak knife into my back just for showing up (I'll leave that to POSH way down the road). No, this place felt good, smelled good and really nailed what a drama teacher told me once: "When you can fake sincerity, you have the world in your hands." This is after all a business, not my Aunt Maria's house. They are out to make a profit by serving guests and this is one place in the Scottsdale area that seems to understand that people don't fork over this kind of money only to be treated like scum.   Ambiance aside, the prices here are truly insane. I did not reach a level where I can afford a meal like this by spending on a meal like this, but friends wanted to go, so there. If you are doing a client entertainment event, make sure you photograph the menu so your company auditors and the IRS will believe you.   The food. Well, it's so "out there" that one cannot really compare it to anything else. It would be a lot like comparing a Ford Crown Vic to a Whoopeedoo SX30000 fictional car. You just can't do it. I think that's the point. The chef/owner wants to be as different as possible, offering up some really weird sounding, looking and tasting items along with some unique spins on more traditional fare, again, avoiding comparisons.   There is a culinary undercurrent in Scottsdale that just tries too hard to set itself apart from the mainstream rather than concentrating on pleasing guests. Chef Binkley seems to have a better grasp of pushing the diner out of his/her own comfortable rut than most. There is the "What the hell is that?" item along with something that looks friendly, known and happy.  But Binkley's suffers from an acute, but curable case of Scottsdalearrhea, which is a condition inflicted by the many Scottsdale culinary schools which try to one-up each other in the "artistic presentation" category. An as example, this school of thought would serve up a peanut butter sandwich, cut into multiple, miniature octagonal shapes, arranged in a scimitar pattern and covered with a half cucumber canopy supported by pillars made of strands of sugar, decorated with violets and orange peel. That's what Binkley's is all about. It's not the food, it's the art. If that's what you are into, you will be pleased. If you are not particularly hungry, you will be pleased. After which you can stop by the Horny Toad for one of their average burgers  so you can feel you had something to eat.   I'm just sorry but for $122, to leave feeling the need to stop at a fast food drive-thru just isn't right. But eating is not what Binkley's is about. It's about seeing and being seen, being able to say you dropped a wad on "dinner" and being able to impress people. Go for the ambiance, have an overpriced drink and an appetizer and move on would be my best advice.
3 I love the food and great wine selection of this place and the fact that it's close to my home.  I've had some issues with the service at times, but I will say that it was quite busy when the service wasn't up to par.  Despite that, it's worth returning to and supporting the local businesses!
5 Phenomenal! My in-laws are regulars and I have always wanted go.  It was well worth it.  Creative and delicious and fun.  The tasting menu is fantastic and fun to see what will come out of the kitchen next.  We took our 13 year old son and he said it was one of the neatest experiences and could not wait to tell his friend he had eaten wild boar.
4 Wonderful unpretentious dining. We opted for the four course tasting and it ended up being about twelve dishes each. Make reservations for earlier in the evening as dining takes approx.3-4 hours long. I loved everything except for two little things, an anise flavored gel that was part of the soft-shell crab dish and the bacon in the polenta dessert. Both items I felt were unnecessary. The service was also top notch. We will be returning here whenever we vaca in az.
5 Simply the BEST restaurant I have ever been to!!!! A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!  We had the five course meal, but there were so many amuse bouches that it seemed like we had a 15-course meal!!!  This place makes eating into entertainment. The food is absolutely divine, and the creativity in the plating is out of this world!!!!!!!!  Honestly, this was the most fun we have had in ages when it comes to eating out!!!!  From the "bubble tea" amuse bouche, which was a colourful cornucopia of yumminess, to the S'MORES amuse bouche for dessert (my favourite campfire pasttime is now an amuse bouche?!? How cool!), the experience was just to-die-for!!!!!!  It is a gastro-experience that is just too amazing to put into a review!!!! (Oh, and the service at Binkley's is equally as fantastic, so get ready for an awesome evening!!!).  We love you Binkley's!!!!!
5 Hands down the most AMAZING dining experience in my life!!!!   From the first bite to the last, which was about 18 courses later, every morsel of food was extremely well thought out and artistically presented. Not only was each dish a visual adventure but the intense taste made each course a new "favorite!" While everything was truly spectacular, I must say the scallops and the pork belly were the 2 BEST bites of food I have ever had in my life!!!!    Equally impressive as the food was the service. Each member of the staff was fully educated in every ingredient in every dish and became part of the dining experience. Hats off to Amy and Kevin and thank you for an edible adventure we will never forget!!!!!
5 Superb! Coming in at 9:30 (note they stop taking new tables at 9:30) straight from a 6 hour road trip we were not necessarily dressed up to "snuff".   But being that "this is Cave Creek" (I still don't really know what that means) my T-shirt, shorts, and flip-flops combo was adequate enough.  Being that we were dining so late, we opted (3 of us) to share 2 ala-carte meals and 1 nice appetizer.  Little did we know we would also be getting 5 amuse bouches! Amazing!  Molecular Gastronomy, generous portions (forgiveness for our dropping a beautiful creation in one of our laps) and wonderful service...a deadly enjoyable combo.  We let our wine selections fall into the wine stewards (yes...they have a wine steward) hands. He didn't disappoint. The wine was spectacular, paired very well.  Overall the meal was outrageously expensive, but oh so worth the splurge.  We tell stories of this dinner in almost a minute-by-minute recounting. It was THAT good.  Do yourself a favor and spoil yourself, it's worth the money.
5 Stunning!!!    7 course meal!   Italian Truffles!   Sunchokes!  Fresh dessert cook in a small organic pumpkin.  Loved it!!!!     Didn't do any research and brought my 2 years old which was a bad idea, but the staff was cordial and accommodating.  Thank you.  I will be back, but I will leave my child at home this time.
5 You'll have to go to the blog for the full scoop - 27 courses is too many to capture here.  With expectations tempered given the circumstances but certainly higher than with a traditional "interview" dinner my arrival at Binkley's was timely and finding the couple already present and waiting in the lobby we exchanged pleasantries before reservations were confirmed were quickly led through the spacious dining room to a table just out of view of the kitchen.  With noise moderate and the front-of-house surprisingly smiley and professional yet whimsical and conversant from the moment we arrived I knew we would be in good hands (but little did I know HOW good.)  Seated at a comfortable four-top it would be mere moments after seating that our captain would greet us and after confirming water choices we were presented with a wine list and menus while the a la carte vs. 4/5/6 course tasting menu option was explained.  With my co-diners having never experienced such a place and with many of the items on the menu rather novel to them we were left to decide and largely allowing them to dictate the pace we settled on the five course tasting...or so we thought as what followed would actually be a twenty-seven "course" three hour and forty five minute rollercoaster ride through the imagination of Chef Binkley and his team.  A few highlight dishes:  Brioche Cinnamon Doughnuts with Bacon Butter:  piping hot and minimally greasy they were peerless, particularly when smeared with the umami-savory flavors of hickory smoked bacon.  "Deep Fried Butter" with Lobster Cream Cheese and Lobster Roe Powder, Chef Binkley's take on Lobster Bisque created by dropping a butter cube into the fryer and subsequently injecting it with the cream cheese before dusting it with roe.  Sweet, creamy, intense and just like the sloppy joe a faithful recreation of the chef's intention...if this were served at the bar I'd go and order a dozen.  Foie Gras Beignets with White Truffle Cream and Foie Gras Vanilla Milk Shake with Blackberry Swirl and Blackberry Whipped Cream."  Beginning first with the light balls of dough, each with a wispy crumb studded with whole cubes of duck liver torchon these bites were superlative on their own but even more so with the slightly sweet and ethereally aromatic cream.  Taking a bite and then moving to the shake...yes, it was absolutely as good as it sounds - a smooth blend of blackberries and heavy cream with the gossamer of the liver always present yet slightly out of reach.  Entitled "Crispy seared Foie Gras with apple, raisins, pomegranate, spiced Brazil nuts, popover, chervil" and finished tableside with a spritz (literally from a spritzer) of cinnamon Ice Wine vinegar this preparation of duck liver would arrive as a linear stripe on a square plate and harkening the plating style of Michael Carlson the flavors would also compare favorably as the crackling exterior of the foie gave way to the melting interior and each bite lent itself to a new form of explanation with the accoutrements - most sweet, many smooth, and all interesting; particularly the popover stuffed with a creamy puree of liver, nuts, and aromatic spices.  For the next intermezzo all I can call it is a tease - a bit of dining refinement between novelty desserts that absolutely wowed - a two-bite Peanut Butter Souffle with Raspberry Jam every bit as "soufflé" as the sloppy joe was its namesake and along with the foie gras beignet perhaps my favorite bites of a great meal.  Really - if this was offered on the menu I'd have ordered a full sized one in a heartbeat.  In the end Binkley's is a place that no matter where it was located would be special and a place that I'll undoubtedly return to with frequency if my career path should indeed land me in the desert long term.
5 Went to a truly outstanding Pinot Noir wine dinner at Binkley's with Dukes Family Vineyard.  The food was really top-notch, the wine pairings were lovely, and the value was amazing, especially considering what was served -- for $110 per person we had tuna tartare with fresh ahi that had been shipped in from Hawaii the same day, truffle risotto (OMG), duck breast, venison au poivre, and amazing tripe cream whipped potatoes.  Each course was paired with a unique Pinot that complimented wonderfully.  But the crowning grace of the evening was the wonderful service provided by Binkley's: we had made reservations far in advance for this dinner, which is served to everyone in the restaurant simultaneously over a 3 hour time frame.  My husband and I had our babysitter cancel on us at the last minute and ended up in a time pinch, but we did not want to cancel out on this dinner!  Binkley's went out of their way to accommodate us by speeding up our dinner (which wasn't rushed at all) and serving us on our own schedule to get us out the door relatively quickly (in about an hour and a half as opposed to three hours).  I expect that this was quite an inconvenience for them, as the evening was designed to serve a very large group of people all together in courses, but they happily accommodated us.  This was fabulous service, food, and wine, and I can't recommend enough.
5 Awesome awesome awesome!!! Our table all ordered a 5 course tasting  and it was amazing!! The flavors pop in your mouth!! Very creative chef. I don't think there was one course we were disappointed in. By the end of the 3 hour dinner we had a total of 21 courses. Each one full of flavor making you want more. The staff was excellent, always there when you need them but not hovering. I would definitely go again. Pricey but so worth it!!
5 My husband and I chose Binkleys for our 5th anniversary dinner. We don't usually spend that much on a meal, but for a special occasion we decided to splurge, and we are soooo glad we did. We decided to do the 4 course tasting meal, and with the many amuse bouche's throughout the meal we left so full, I couldn't even finish my wonderful seared foie gras. The atmosphere was cosy and inviting, the wait staff friendly and helpful. The three hours we spent enjoying our meal was well spent. We would both like to revisit and enjoy another taste adventure with this lovely resturant.
4 Best I tasting menu in town.
5 L correctly pointed out that I did not list this restaurant under my reviews. I just started working on all the restaurants, we have been to in the last three years. My guess is over 150. So, I am going to see how high I get.  This is a very classy operation,  because it was L's birthday may be, yikes. I remember them doing something special for us, or was it my birthday? It was someone's birthday and they did something special.   I remember the after part that they call the next day to ask how your meal was. I think that is very classy and have never had a restaurant do that before. The chefs sister is in charge of that. So, that was what is memorable to me.
5 Wonderful variety, small portions and great favors. Perfect for a special occasion. Ambiance could be improved.
5 A first class meal from beginning to end.
5 This remains my favorite restaurant in the valley.  It is expensive and you'll be here quite a while so be prepared for both.  The tasting menu is the way to go and it's fun to go with a group so you get to try even more things.  We go there several times a year and they know us which is pretty impressive.  The staff and service are always excellent.  If you're looking for a special experience, this is it.
5 In a word: WOW.  If you are a foodie, do not miss this place.  We had the 6 course tasting, which literally was 16 courses - no joke.  Amazing service.  Crazy good flavors.  This is a top dining establishment for the US, not merely Arizona.  I won't recount each dish; that will spoil the fun.  But be warned: the portions are larger than you'd expect, and you'll leave full and happy.
5 Binkley's is an experience that can't be compared to any other and certainly is memorable. You pick your courses and receive them coupled with a parade of maybe a dozen tasting plates that includes a combination of traditional foods and molecular gastronomy. I feel we got the most satisfaction because we choose to get the wine paring and I feel food and wine pared takes food to a much higher level.  The cold appetizers were picture perfect you could snap a picture and have artwork for your house but the hot appetizers are really something to rave about. Both were great but I think the one that might be the most memorable was the SHAVED BLACK TRUFFLES on a perfect soft farm egg on some sort of fresh grilled bread with mornay sauce. This one dish was exceptional and the next day me and my husband were craving it.  Somewhere in-between appetizers and dinner we enjoyed a variety of cheese and fondue.  For the dinners we picked Wild Striped Bass , Chicken , and Ribeye. We both thought the Chicken was the stand out dish and was roasted in way that tasted different from any other roasted chicken we ever tasted . We were also told the chicken can from just right up the street and was alive yesterday . Our second favorite was the striped bass that was cooked and seasoned to perfection followed by the Rib Eye . The Rib Eye was good but wasn't a stand out like the Chicken.  Dessert was interesting, we shared the raspberries and they came out with liquid nitrogen and froze the sauce with a big puff. I have to admit I was slightly scared I would get splashed but I didn't. This plate was fancy embellished with micro sized blondie bars and had the raspberries stuffed with a little bit of cream and had creamy drops of that nitrogen ice cream also nuts and very tasty frozen citrus pieces.  SOME only some not all of the small tastings were- Yu Shu Flowers that you brushed threw oil and a seasoning. Savory Donut Squash/Apple Soup Frozen Citrus Salad Wine Braised Currents vanilla Couscous Beef Jerky horseradish foam perfect chervil lardon egg in a micro tiny thimbal shaped puff pastry Apple Bomb looked like raw egg yolks but was molecular gastronomy Key Lime Lollipop Cinnamon Souffle Some I liked more than others only a few were misses for me but all were very interesting.  The Dinner for us was three hours, the staff was very orchestrated well timed and extremely professional. Binkey's called us the next day to thank us for coming.
5 As a previous reviewer stated:  "This restaurant is like no other".  We had a birthday celebration and we couldn't have chosen a better place to eat.    First of all, the service is second to none.  Every staff member that we encountered was very professional and happy to explain the food and answer any questions we had.  They obviously like working there because they were all so upbeat and smiley.  You feel welcome as soon as you step in the door.  Now for the food - fantastic!  I ordered the four course tasting menu and everything was superb.  My husband ordered the ribeye steak and enjoyed every mouthful, although the portion was a bit on the small side.  But, in between each course came a little treat of creativity from the chef so that's something we've never encountered before.  For example, we each had an espresso sized cup of a creamy soup that was so delicate and delicious that we were wishing for more.  They also served us a little savory doughnut, about the size of a dollar coin, that was oh-so-good as well as little cranberry "shooters" that had little teenie squares of jello (not really jello, of course, but a fruit gel of some sort).  Somewhere in between everything else we were also served a prosciutto mousse that was smooth and delicate.  As the meal drew to an end, they again brought out a little taster and this time it was piping hot mini cinnamon souffles with a creme anglaise on top.  For dessert, I ordered the goat's milk panna cotta that had a marmalade bottom and alongside were orange, grapefruit and strawberry segments and to top that off the server drizzled honey over all.  Fantastic!  We didn't consume any alcohol but we did have a nice bottle of water and purchased two coasters ($10/each) that flash colored lights when a glass is placed on them.  The total was $169, including the coasters but not including the tip so it wasn't an inexpensive night but it was well worth it.  I can't wait until the next birthday celebration!
5 If you are a foodie or if you at all appreciate fine food then you must experience Binkley's once in your life. Though it may seem out of place in Cave Creek next to an Enterprise, once inside the restaurant (or outside on the front, enclosed patio) you forget where you are. The inside of the restaurant is quaint and warm but we sat outside by the lit fireplace that provided an intimate ambiance. All the staff is knowledgeable, friendly and all seem passionate about food. We were told Chef Binkley may change the menu up to 3 times in one day to exhibit the local fare, which is also a wonderful aspect of this restaurant. Each of us did the five-course tasting along with a wine pairing. Perhaps some of the most delightful parts of the Binkley's experience are the surprise tastings you may get from the Chef throughout your time there. Throughout our time there we received about 8 different samplings that were all unique and tasty. What you are served is truly more than just food, but it also art. When you order off the menu you can in no way be prepared for the beautiful and delicious platters that are set before you. The flavor combinations definitely demonstrate Chef Binkley's passion for food and spices. The wine pairings were fantastic and it was so interesting to learn about each of them. Of course it is not cheap, but it is truly worth it for the experience and the exposure to various foods and tastes.
5 A culinary experience like no other. We were pleasantly surprised to find this unassuming strip mall restaurant to far exceed our culinary expectations. Every one of the 16 tastings was expertly crafted and thoroughly enjoyed.   The staff even had a birthday dinner menu presented to me as a special reminder.
5 Wow - I was really impressed with this hidden gem in Cave Creek!  It was well worth the nearly 1 hour drive to dine here.  The place is really unassuming and quaint, the staff is extremely friendly and truly have the desire to make you have a special evening and the food is really the star!  We enjoyed the 4 course meal and were so impressed...it was more like a 10+ course meal considering how many little tastes they brought to the table throughout the meal.    All of the ingredients were fresh and flavorful and just the right size.  The meal started with the artichoke appetizer, followed by a pasta dish, followed by a peppered ribeye and then concluded with a chocolate dessert...all very good!  I can see why this place is rated one of the best in AZ and I can't believe it took me this long to try it out!  Excited to try Cafe Bink next.
5 We dined at Binkley's for a very special family occasion and had an outstanding experience.  I have eaten In restaurants  around the world and this one stands  up with some of the best.  The food was creative, gorgeously presented and delicious to the last bite.  The service was generous and efficient.  They even added some personal touches for our celebrated guest which was thoughtful and appreciated by all.  Great care was given to the wine pairings and the house somalier was polite and knowledgeable.  The between courses "amuses bouches" were simply a delight!  I can't say enough about what a wonderful dining experience we had at Binnkley's.  It  deserves the fuss and excellent ratings.
4 We've been trying to get here for several years and never make reservations in time or want to go on a Sunday when they are closed. We finally went for the full dinner menu at the bar.  I like the interaction with the bartender and having a glimpse in to the kitchen.  The food was creative and complicated, but comfortable.  Although, I thought there were times when they tried to hard to keep the food approachable- i.e. a taster plate of a trio of sandwiches, which followed a palate cleansing taste, that just didn't seem to fit in the overall experience.    I could have used a cheat sheet as I was eating to remember what all the ingredients were- like when you get a wine flight so you don't forget what you are drinking!   The Pastry Chef had a Circle K styrofoam cooler on the back of her station- again not sure if it was a statement in "approachability" or just a small miss on attention to detail?  But given the crisp presentation of everything else in the restaurant, I found it out of place.  The scallops were my standout- delicious!  And a taster plate of what I think was called "Glacier Lettuce" that the server described as a succulent grown in New River that I loved!  Overall, a great experience and great food!
5 this place is fabulous.  my husband and i were in town visiting my parents and the four of us went for dinner to celebrate my b-day.  we could only get a reservation on the patio, which made us nervous, dealing w/ the AZ heat and/or winds of that weekend.  but, the patio was great.  it's a cozy area w/ a fireplace and screens on all sides to block the sun.  it's about as nice a patio as you can get.    we all four ordered from the regular menu and were thrilled with our selections and portion sizes.  we ordered these starters:  figs and chevre, lobster ravioli, tomatoes and baby octopus and spring vegetable soup.  the only one that was lacking was the tomato and baby octopus dish, which only had about 2 pieces of octopus.  the other three were fantastic - beautiful presentation all around and i've never eaten a better bowl of vegetable soup.  seriously, i can't say enough about how delicious that soup was.    for entrees, we ordered:  lamb, filet mignon, two-wash chicken.  all were delicious, and, again, beautifully presented.  this meal was about much more than the food we ordered, though.  throughout the dining experience, they bring out many little "bites" or "amuse bouches."  each one is beautiful, delicious and inventive.  i've always been a bit put off by the whole "molecular gastronomy" fad, but binkley's does it just right.  they incorporate highly creative and inventive touches throughout your dining experience.  it's inventive and unusual enough to create a new and exciting experience for diners, but without just being plain weird.  for example, one of the amuses was a mango packet, that they had created with mango pulp, which had been frozen then coated w/ something to create a "skin" so it exploded in your mouth.  it was presented in a porcelain soup spoon with something around it (i can't remember... fruit juice perhaps?), so it looked just like a fresh raw egg.  it was really amazing to look at and then experience the flavors and the "pop" as you ate it.  these touches throughout dinner make the experience fun and new.  the staff is top notch.  everyone knows everything about each dish - from bussers to servers.  and, there are MANY details to learn.  clearly, the staff is very well educated on what is on the menu.  it shows and makes a difference for diners.  can't wait to go to binkley's again!  what an amazing all-around experience.
5 If Michelin gave stars in Phx this would be one star for sure (just ignore the dreadful "CaveCreek" booth surrounding the interior).  This place is an amuse-bouche experience.  My favorite was a Vietnamese sandwich so close to authentic yet only an inch sq.  Amazing detail.  The table next to us had different bites than we did and my dining partner was getting mad.  She was mad because she wanted to taste them all.    After having an exploding cherry, I suggested that it was because they were drinking wine and we were having cocktails.  Not just any cocktails - my martini was made with liquid nitrogen - super cold and super cool.  The portions are delicate and like the amuse they were works of art on a plate.    Binkley's actually called the next day to make sure I had an enjoyable dining experience.  I said yes and would like a table for two at 6pm.  So much fun.  Such good food.  Binkley's just made it to my top places to eat list.
2 We had been waiting to go here for a very long time.  I had heard such great things and since Binkley's had consistently made lists for best dining experience, I was eagerly awaiting the day I'd dine here.  To celebrate our 9 year dating anniversary, my (now) husband surprised me (well as much as he could, since it takes a good 45 minutes to drive there) by taking me here.    We arrived and it was a nice night, so we thought we'd sit outside on the patio (which isn't the best choice it turns out, since its fairly close to the road, and you can hear/smell the cars driving by).  The menus had our names and happy anniversary which was a nice touch.    Service: Our waiter seemed nervous or unsure of himself.  He faltered on the ingredients and some of the items throughout the night.  We would also have to ask to have our water to be refilled and wait some time before it actually happened.  There were lots of other staff that would bring out other dishes, but they weren't very friendly and would often not actually interact.  Mostly just bring the dish and describe without a smile and leave.   Food: We decided that my husband would order an ala carte dish and I would go with the tasting menu to get the full effect.  The amuse bouche were interesting, but I wouldn't say that I was all too impressed.  They were not particularly tasty bites.  For the ala carte, my husband ordered the veal, and we were quite disappointed.  The meat was tough and quite bland.  The side dish of white beans that came with it was delicious though.   For the tasting menu, I understand that portions are smaller (and I don't eat large portions), but they were ridiculously small.  I ordered a ceviche or the cold appetizer, soft shell crab for the hot, rib eye for the meat and halibut for the fish.  The rib eye was super thin, and almost like beef jerky.  Although the flavoring was decent, it was so small and tough that it was a bit hard to eat.  I was just not super impressed and borderline disappointed by everything.  I would like to say I want to come back, and I'm not sure if Binkley's just had an off day, but we were very disappointed by our experience, especially since we had such high hopes.
5 I have been to some pretty amazing restaurants but none that compare to this experience. I was aprehensive to spend $100 or more at a strip mall restaurant but man I'm glad I did! The food is out of this world with creativity and explosive tastes. The amuse' bouche the chef sent out were such a nice touch too. My favorite restaurant to date!
5 if yelp gave a 6th star, this would be the first place to warrant one of any that i've reviewed.   my wife and i recently vacationed in phoenix and wanted to have one amazing meal as a late anniversary celebration. in what now looks like a stroke of luck, our first choice, kai, was closed thru august and not reopening until we had left. a client of my wife's recommended binkley's and one look at the website convinced us to make a reservation ASAP.  cave creek was kind of a random place for a restaurant of this quality, but did offer a nice view of the sunset behind a mountain in the distance. we arrived at 6 for our 6:30 reservation, and they had no problem seating us early. my wife immediately took note of the decor, a series of roses submerged in water in large, cylindrical vases in the entrance. we went all in on the 6-course tasting menu, as it was marginally more expensive than the 4- or 5-course menus, and when in rome...  almost immediately after our order was taken, we received the first of many eagerly anticipated amuse-bouches. savory bacon donuts sprinkled with parmesan cheese along with a bacon butter. before i get into the meal itself, for anyone complaining about portions: 1) amuses are meant to be one bite; 2) the service informs you that the tasting portions are smaller than the a la carte options; and 3) both of us were more than full when leaving the restaurant.  over the course of the meal, we were served a total of 12 amuses, most notably including a mini-sandwich trio consisting of muffaletta, banh mi and sloppy joes, truffled potato skins, a platter of chicken liver mousse, pistachio butter and nectarine jam, frozen arnold palmers, mango "bombs", mint consomme with 4 kinds of chocolate dots served on an LED coaster, and a warm cinnamon souffle with apple creme anglaise.  if that doesn't whet your palette, then the actual courses will. for 6 courses, you get a cold appetizer, a hot appetizer, a fish, a meat, a cheese plate (or truffle fondue, my pick), and a dessert.  since my wife will surely offer up her own review, I will just highlight my dishes. when we were served each course, our server (primarily nicole, who was amazing) identified each ingredient in the dish, offering more detail than what was given on the menu. this was followed up by a visit from the maitre d, angus, who gave even MORE insight, on things like the source and seasonality of the ingredients and answered any questions we had (like how DO they make that lobster powder? answer: dried lobster roe pulvarized in a food processor and passed thru a chinois).  my cold app was a poached king salmon with sake-cured salmon roe, cucumber, pickled onion, and dabbed all over the plate by a dill-horseradish emulsion and creme fraiche, served with a little glass of cold cucumber soup with chipotle oil. every course was top notch, but THIS is the one i keep coming back to. just unreal.  for my hot app, i had the uni risotto with a wasabi foam which had a special treat that i've never had the privilege of eating: spot prawn roe. as if the spot prawns themself weren't enough!!  for fish, i got polenta-dusted scallop dish with chorizo rounds, ratatouille and a chorizo corncake that was cooked to perfection. and meat was a mesquite-seasoned ribeye that was somehow not the highlight of that course. that honor was reserved for the oxtail papusa. if you don't know what that is, google it!!  when it came time for dessert, we were already filling up. since my wife ordered the cheese plate, i opted for the truffle fondue, which came with celery, purple potato, popcorn, and dried fruit for dipping. it marked the third time in the meal that we were eating truffles, counting 2 of the amuses.  finally to top it off, a dessert simply called blueberries. there was a blueberry-filled donut, a chocolate and blueberry shooter topped off with a balsamic cream, some kind of blueberry cake, but the real highlight that had everyone in the restaurant looking our way was when our server added the "freezing soup" around the edge of the plate: a combo of blueberry consomme and liquid nitrogen!  it was our second smoky experience of the meal, as earlier i had ordered a martini with liquid nitrogen after seeing one come out of the bar. i had asked angus for some type of chili martini since it seemed appropriate for the desert, but after informing me that they didnt have any fresh chilis to make the drink, he offered up an even better alternative: old tom gin. i'd never had it before, so he brought me a little sip to get my approval and then the martini arrived, liquid nitrogen smoke and all, minutes later.  i could go on and on, but this whole experience was a first for me. the combination of mindblowing food coupled with incredibly accomodating and informative service has to put binkley's at the top of the list of restaurants i've visited. i would make the 2600+ mile trip to the desert just to eat there again!
5 We dined at Binkley's last night and it was fantastic.  Possibly one of the best restaurant meals I have ever had.  I am a pretty picky eater - I don't like raw tuna, fishy fish, fatty meats, or eggs.  Plus, we do not eat pork.  As a result, though I was really excited about trying this restaurant, I was still a little nervous about liking the food.  I needn't have worried -- this restaurant is very high concept, but very approachable.  There were four diners and we selected the five courses with wine pairings because we wanted to try everything.  Under that approach, you get a cold appetizer, hot appetizer, fish, meat/poultry, cheese or dessert.  That said, we actually had a total of 17 different plates!!!!  Before we even ordered, the fantastic wait staff began bringing us goodies.  When we tried to identify a favorite this morning, it was truly difficult because everything was so delicious.  And playful!  And cool!  The menu changes here everyday, which is exciting and disappointing, too, because there are things I would defnitely like to try again.  But when I think about it, I suppose it is no big deal because I can't wait to see what Kevin Binkley comes up with next time.  Also, I mentioned that we do not eat pork.  The kitchen went out of their way to make sure that we received alternative or modified dishes if pork was involved.  Only once did they forget and bring us a plate with pork on it -- but the waiter realized it before we did and quickly apologized and brought us something else (the vegetarian option that time).  Now that's thoughtful!  Some of the cooler plates were the lava lamp shooters -- a shot glass filled with mint water and small chocolate balls placed on top of a stand that flashes different colored lights up the glass.  Or the small puffed pastry with a minute egg yolk.  Or the beautiful okra flowers with a sweet and hot dipping sauce.  Or the absolutely delectable butternut squash soup (perhaps my favorite).  Or the little piece of fried chicken on my poulet rouge plate (also served with braised leg and a baked breast piece).  Or the apple soup with peanut dust on the rim of the tiny cup it is served in -- we literally watched diners licking the dust off the rim!    I cannot wait to return!  (Also, they called me today to make sure we enjoyed our experience -- who does that?!)
5 One of the best dining experiences of my life, from my first bite to my last, my mouth was enticed.  Chef Binkley and his team do not have a kitchen the have a studio to create food art each dish with its own distinct palette of flavor.  It is the price of a dinner and a show, but it is an experience to savor over three or four hours and worth every penny.  The staff including Amy Binkley invite you into the restaurant as if it were there home including a peek into the kitchen if you choose.  We even received a "thank you for joining" us call the next day.  If you visit Phoenix or live in the area, this is a must!  I won't go into the many courses, because the menu is ever evolving but some of my favorites were bacon doughnuts with bacon butter, a foie gras Popsicle, and a lobster mushroom with my rib-eye.  This isn't an everyday adventure-- it is truly special and the definition of fine dining.
5 This place is simply amazing.  Went here for our 1st wedding anniversary and couldn't have had a better time.  Reservations are a must, as seating is limited.  Since we were very excited to taste as much as we could, we splurged for the 6 course tasting with wine pairing.  In hindsight, it's a little much though.  It was certainly a culinary experience, but would have been just as nice with 4 or 5 course tasting.  My wife ended being pretty full after the. 4th course, so struggled a bit, but didn't want to miss anything! All of the little "amuse bouche" kept us entertained between courses. Overall, we had great service, amazing food and a good time.  Certainly don't go here with any budget considerations though...
5 Totally awesome. Foie gras pudding pops. Hell yeah.
5 Took my boyfriend here for his birthday and have to say this was my most favorite dining experience.   Food was excellent.  We did a 5 course meal and were pleasantly surprised by all of the little food items they brought in between the courses.  Each course was unique and fun.  Great service as well.  Totally worth the drive to Cave Creek!
5 A friend and I dined at Binkley's for AZ Restaurant Week, AMAZING!!! From the moment we sat down, the service, food and presentation were exceeded our expectations!! A must for folks who prefer a fine dining experince!
5 Nothing else quite like it in AZ that's for sure!!! Absolutely amazing!
5 My wife and I went last night and had one of the best meals of our lives.  We both had the 5 course tasting menu with paired wines.  LIke others before have said, the service is exceptional, the food extraordinary and the wines excellent.  Each of the amuse bouches were amazing.  I will return here the next time I visit the area
5 Binkley's was amazing!  More courses than I could remember and all delicious.  They brought a "Mango Bomb" that looked like a poached egg in a spoon.  When I bit into it, it exploded in delicious mango flavor!  I can't say enough good things about this place!
5 Wow.  Fast the whole day before dinner and drink water only. Do the drive up to Cave Creek. Do the tasting menu and fasten your seat-belts, you're in for a pretty crazy ride.   The meal started with a savory doughnut with thyme, parmesan, and bacon butter. A playful amuse that set the tone for the evening. Delicious. Next, a plate of three-mini, bite-sized sandwiches: a Sloppy Joe's, banh mi, and muffaletta. Does this place have a sense of humor? Oh yeah. Which leads to the next bite: fried prosciutto & tater tot on a toothpick in white cheddar foam. I was sold on FRIED prosciutto.   You're probably sensing this isn't your USUAL dinner.   Next up, Dippin' Dot liquid nitrogen frozen fruit salad. Bet you haven't had this before. Hilarious. Excellent. Duck rilette with molasses foam. Of course, a molasses FOAM.  Let's be clear, this is a white-cloth, fine-dining establishment. But man, there's a sense of fun and adventure here.    One of the most beautiful dishes I had this year was the Fruits de Mer, with mussels, prawn, uni, salmon, shrimp, grapefruit, radish, grapes, sea beans, red onion, jalapeno, mango, and lavosh. The influence of The French Laundry was no more apparent than in this dish. And the taste, the rainbow of tastes, my goodness, surpassed the gorgeous plating.   Puff with bacon and bacon powder. Bacon twice? Yes, please!  Are you exhausted yet? We're not even halfway though the meal. Each bite was somehow familiar and exotic.  Italian sausage with rutabaga cream and crisp, horseradish foam, red and white pearl onions, and German potato salad. Bon with prosciutto on a spoon. Arctic char with skin, caramel spring garlic, water chestnuts, pickled ginger, sugar snap peas, and roasted garlic quinoa. Orange soda palate cleanser. Sesame seared pork tenderloin, teriyaki belly biscuit, pineapple, avocado puree, choke cherries, radicchio & pineapple & sesame seed crisps ...  Deep breath.   Three cheeses with figs. A most excellent pineapple shot with apricot and guava jello cubes, served on a special coaster to create a lava lamp effect. Of course. Bubblegum lollipop. Then the most artistic, delicious, large, and fun dessert I can remember: a blackberry and raspberry cheesecake deconstructed. It looked like a slice of cheesecake had exploded neatly onto a deformed plate. This was absolutely brilliant. Chocolate with currant, tutti frutti puf, and raspberry gelee.   Deep breath again. And a bathroom break.   A decaffeinated cappuccino to celebrate surviving this over-the-top experience.   After going to Pizzeria Bianco, Kai, T. Cook's, The Fry House, and Binkley's, I realized that Phoenix must be one of the most underrated food cities in the entire country. If not for a meal at a place called Alinea in Chicago, I would say my meal at Binkley's was the most unique and entertaining meals I've ever had. And of course delicious too.   If you're in Phoenix, Binkley's Restaurant has to be on your short list. You don't want to miss this.
5 Had an outstanding meal with my lovely lady a few years back at this little gem. We were prepared for the strip mall location but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the service and food quality. Just be prepared to be fed "mini me food" at high prices. Binkley's is all about foodies, not buffet grazers. On our visit, we had the pleasure of being served by the manager. The restaurant was full so he took it upon himself to cater to us personally. He made the experience one of the most relaxed and joyful meals we have ever had. From our conversation with him, he was about to leave Binkley's to start up his own restaurant so his gracious and attentive service was even more appreciated. He could have just phoned it in but he chose to make our evening very special. Bravo!
5 Love this place! Went here for my boyfriends birthday and it was such an experience! We got the six course menu, but we probably should have gotten the 4 or 5 course because they gave so many extras, we became full really fast. Their courses were so inventive, fun, and delicious!!! We'll definitely come here again for a special occasion!   I can't pick a favorite dish because everything was so unique and delicious!
3 i took my niece ther today for lunch be prepared to part with some cash .I had the antipasta plate which was good,but i have had more creative antipasto elsewhere $16.00 came with olives,caper berries, marinated califlower, 2 meats and a cheese and several slices of toasted foccica  also had a bowl of butternut squash soup which was good $ 9.00 my niece had the muffolatta which look good as well. I also had a glass of wine our server was very pleasant but with a total of 6 people in the place 2 of those were us and i had to wait to get a second glass of wine even though she noticed my glass was empty as she walked by.
5 I completely enjoyed my meal at Binkley's.  I didn't know exactly what to expect when we made a reservation to dine here, which may have added to the charm of the night.  Driving up to the restaurant set the stage for the meal...  up through the desert, with the black sky allowing the stars to twinkle their icy lights as we passed through a very western group of plazas...  Truly something you don't experience everyday while living in Silicon Valley!  This night in particular was quite chilly, so when we entered the restaurant, we welcomed the warm air immediately.    I must admit that I have never had fine dinning quite the way I experienced at Binkley's.  There was no air of stuffiness and no waiters speaking in hushed tones.  The dining areas were filled with people enjoying their meals and their company, tons of laughter!  Definitely not the norm for fine dining.  Our food was outstanding!  One dish that I regret I did not get myself, but that I was able to sample, was their truffle risotto.  Oh man, my husband and I had a few tastes of our cousin's dish and instantly became envious!  The best part came when a server asked him if he would like additional black truffle shavings on top...  Ridiculous!  I thought, "Sure, let's put even more magic into this dish!"  And she just kept shaving and shaving paper thin slices of black truffle into that risotto...    The presentation was truly meticulous.  I had ordered the sweet potato pie as my dessert and was pleasantly surprised to see a deconstructed masterpiece.  It was so lovely that the woman next to me tried to change her dessert order upon seeing it, however she was a little too late.    All our servers were courteous and very knowledgeable of the food they presented to us.  Even the sommelier was charming and easy going.  I have found most sommeliers to be a tad snobby, however his explanation of each and every wine was done with a gentle, but authoritative tone.  I cannot think of a negative to say about them.    We will have to come back here...  Even if it's just for the risotto...
5 Everything was perfect!  There are so many courses and surprises, no one couldn't be pleased.  The food is terrific, and there is something for everyone.   The staff is also terrific, and one can tell these people seem to like what they do.  Make no mistake, this is an expensive restaurant (over 250 per person with tax and tip) but I feel it was sowrth every penny.  Can't wait to go back.
1 Even if you had reservations for a week in advance and your table is 45 minutes late never ask for a single thing at Binkleys. The owner will cuss you out not serve you and kick you out while still making you pay 280 for small plates of food. Last time I checked at the 4-5 star restaurants I have frequented in Paris, Chicago, DC, Dublin, Rome, London, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Barcelona, and Madrid this would be considered abusive and slanderous . What a shame that a man has to treat customers like this. You never know who you are serving and word of mouth spreads fast among high power doctors and business people. Mr Binkley let me know when you get your Michelin rating because I'm sure that will never happen as superior customer service is a main requirement.
5 If I could give a 6th star, I would.  7, even.  Binkley's can have all the stars.  I went with a group of 4 to celebrate my boyfriend's mother's birthday.  In fact, there was a "happy birthday" message inside the menu!  Nice touch.  I had to look twice at the prices; this is definitely a special occasion type of restaurant.    We each chose the 4-course tasting menu.  I can't even imagine getting the 5 or 6 course options!  We hadn't even ordered yet when we got our first "amuse-bouche" of little chips made from interesting things, like kale or salmon skin.  I think we had a total of 10 little dishes before the first course we actually ordered arrived.  That was quickly followed by palette cleansers of flash-frozen melon and a mango bomb.  After the second appetizer and entree, we had another palette cleanser (pineapple juice and fruit on a strobe-light base) and dessert.  Then another palette cleanser.  The food was incredible.  Everything is so creative, with ingredients I'd never think to combine if it were up to me.  There was more flavor in the mini-sloppy joe that was about the size of a quarter, than I can get in a full sized one.  How do they get potatoes hollow and full of air?  How is there chorizo inside a scallop?  Why does the duck liver taste like chocolate? Who put the bop in the bop shoo bop shoo bop?  I ate things I never thought I would, like duck liver and ham mousse, but I have no regrets.  Every bite was awesome.  If someone made me choose a favorite, I would probably flounder for a while naming off every dish, but eventually land on the Buffalo Carpaccio.  Wow.  The presentation was an integral part of the experience.  I think we commented on every dish and serving platter... you won't find these at Bed Bath and Beyond.  It's like each dish was created specifically for the food it would have the honor of carrying.  One "little treat" was served inside a test-tube full of smoke.  One dessert had to be chiseled open at the table.  The mango bomb looked like an egg in a spoon.  You just don't find these things anywhere else.  The servers knew so much about the menu, explained as much as we wanted, and were so friendly.  We had more people helping us than there were of us.  The customer service is impeccable.    The whole evening took about 3 hours, and we all left feeling happy, stuffed, and sleepy.  I will definitely go back, next time there is an occasion special enough to warrant Binkley's!
5 Definitely romantic. Definitely pricey. Definitely worth it. This is the ultimate place for culinary creativity. So very intimate and delicious. Every amuse is a new taste that sparks curiosity. Save this for an anniversary. It's worth the drive and girls who love food will appreciate this!
5 Why haven't you been here yet? Truly the best restaurant North of Shea Blvd.  Their foie gras is simply amazing! As that ding bat Rachel Ray would say "yummo".  Just be sure to try and refinance your mortgage before you come! You are gonna need the extra cash as these 5 stars come at a steep cost!
5 If I had my way I would give Binkley's 10 stars!! Food, hospitality and attention - everything top notch! I am a BIG time foodie and always looking for new places to try, ever since being to Binkley's no other restaurant can match upto this experience!  Always a delight, always a pleasure when the chef himself is so warm and caring for the customers' needs. I loooveee Binkley's!!!!! :)
5 I really enjoyed my experience at Binkley's.  The environment in Arizona is so different than the northwest so driving up to the restaurant I wouldn't have imagined it would taste as good as it did.  Apparently earlier in the day the chef had picked some edible flowers on the way to work so we got a taste of that!  They thought of every little intricate detail imaginable and executed superbly from start to finish.  Our napkins had a ribbon tide in a bow with their logo on it.  On the way out they also provided us with a mini bag of housemade nuts which were delicious.  We started with fried donut and bacon butter, followed by pumpkin soup.  A few petite nibbles in between courses included sloppy Joe, banh mi & quiche.  Next was the petite mozzarella with tomato oil topped with saffron and apricot preserve, chicken liver mousse and toast.  Beautiful presentation of mushroom risotto, which was paired with a glass of merlot.  Warm figs and prosciutto paired with a glass of riesling.  Then we had Foie Gras served with tempura fried peach, a brush of cherry glaze & garnished with macadamia nut.  The main dishes included three types of pork served with a sweet potato puree and 2 ounces of beef ragu, but it was 2 ounces of foodgasm.   The only short fall would have been my dry cappuccino.  Being from the Northwest I suppose I am slightly a coffee snob.  I do enjoy a cappuccino after dinner and they weren't even sure what a dry cappuccino was.  It was burnt.  I guess I should have stuck with a drip.  The creamer was in the shape of a cow and the cream came out of it's mouth.  Loved it!
5 This is hands-down one of the best dining experiences I have had in many years.  I travel quite a bit for my job and I am fortunate to have an opportunity to eat in many of the nicer restaurants around the country, but I have to say that I have not experienced anything like Binkey's anywhere. My girlfriend took me to Binkley's for my birthday this past weekend and it was simply a wonderful experience. The care and expertise of each course was amazing.    We each ordered a 6 course dinner with wine parings so we had an opportunity to sample almost every dish on the menu and I don't think there was one that we weren't amazed by.   The only thing that was more impressive than the food was the staff and their impeccable service.  Timing and attention to detail was flawless.  Like the food, I have not experienced that level of service and attention in many years either, including what some consider the "finest" restaurants in country.  You could tell everyone truly enjoyed working there and had a passion for the experience they were providing for their guests.  Thank you so much to staff at Binkley's for making our evening and my birthday a very memorable one.  We'll be back soon!
5 One word...amazing!
1 I don t get this place ? I spent $100 on my meal and still left hungry. Did the tasting menu, the portions were so small it was ridicules.  Service was great they seem like they have a good thing going. Everything looked good, just not enough .
3 This is a place I have wanting to try for years and we finally came last night for Restaurant Week.  The set menu consisted of a sweet pea vichyssoise, a lamb dish with spaetzle and squash and a strawberry soup for dessert.  They brought out a few little extras too, including the worlds smallest sloppy joe.  Really.  It was about the size of a penny.  First off, I'm not a huge fan of molecular gastronomy.  I don't mind it at all, but it's not so,etching I seek out.  I generally don't get why one wouldn't just serve a blueberry instead of a small, squishy, blueberry flavored orb.  The first course, the sweet pea vichyssoise had a couple of croutons in the bottom of the bowl, a couple thin strips on smoked salmon and some salmon roe.  The waiter then used a whipped cream canister to squirt out our pea foam.  It had an interesting texture and tasted very nice.  Next we had the lamb main course.  I'm not a huge fan of lamb but I thought I would give it a try.  I enjoyed the wine braised lamb but the tenderloin was too "lamby" for my tastes.  I expected as much so no big deal.  The herbed spaetzle that came with it was delicious.  Unfortunately, there was only a small spoonful of braised lamb and maybe a spoonful or so of the spaetzle.  For dessert they brought out a bowl with a few pieces of fruit in it, poured over a strawberry juice then topped it off with liquid nitrogen.  Some of ours freezes into the sorbet they said it would, others just got a little colder but stayed soupy.  Regardless, it was delicious.  Everything really was delicious.  The taste wasn't the problem.  Now, I don't know if you picked up on it, but the portions were tiny.  Incredibly tiny and I'm not one to normally complain about portion sizes.  The majority of my dinner usually comes home with me.  Binkley's seems like a perfect place for a multi course meal because the portion sizes they gave us reflected that.  With at least five courses, you probably wouldn't leave hungry.  With only three, we joked about stopping at Dairy Queen up the road, but really, we were only half joking.
3 Ok. I was expecting to be wowed by this place. I wanted to be wowed! But, I wasn't.  Came here for restaurant week, and we all ordered off of the restaurant week menu.  There weren't any options, at all really.  The main course was lamb, and I am no lamb fan.  But I went with it.    The food was good. The food was inventive.  I particularly liked the molecular gastronomy aspects to some of the dishes!  Foam!  Liquid nitrogen!  Why I wasn't wowed: - Portion sizes were pretty small.  One of the courses was a mini sloppy joe, and it was smaller than my husbands thumb fingernail.  We're not big eaters, but we did feel like we wanted more food after all was said and done. - Service.  I was offered a drink at the beginning of the meal, and by the second course I was out of drink.  I was NEVER offered another drink.  I probably would have spent another $30-$40 on cocktails, but was just never offered another drink.   -Ambiance.  I didn't like it.  I thought it was small, and very loud.    After reading so many rave reviews, and knowing Binkley was up for a James Beard, I was just expecting to LOVE LOVE LOVE it.  And I didn't.  For the money, I'd rather go to Kai.
5 There is little, if anything, that can be said about Binkley's that hasn't already. The attention to detail by everyone from the front of the house to the back is impeccable. The experience is dramatic and entertaining, though the ambiance is casual and relaxed.   The kitchen is successful on so many levels: the presentation ranges from darling to decadent and even the tiniest morsel provides LAYERS of flavor. The mini slider(s) are my all-time favorite because they exemplify this. I'm not kidding. We're not just talking "packing a flavor punch," here... it's LAYERS of flavor in ONE tiny bite!!  An embarrassing kicker: while always interested in seeing what the hype was about, I was reluctant to spend my *own* money on dinner at Binkley's... finally, a dear friend gifted me with dinner for my birthday. Let me just say: It is worth. every. penny! Not only would (and HAVE) I spent my own money on it since, but I would consider giving it as a gift!
5 Without question the best restaurant experience of my life.  Period, end of story.  Went here for Restaurant Week (which is a HUGE bargain compared to what they normally charge).  The restaurant week menu was a 4 course tasting (which is actually more like 9 or 10 tastings).  I'm normally not one for tiny portions, but the flavors are so powerful and the pace of the tastings was so perfect that I was never hungry (but at the same time never completely full).  From the bacon chips to the ginger lemon cocktail to the lamb (oh, the lamb), to the brioche bread and multiple chocolate dessert tastings, everything was incredible.  Tremendous service by the staff as they walked us through the entire menu of items, but weren't intrusive at all.   Bottomline, all the hype you've heard about this place is true and then some.  Kevin Binkley has created a culinary wonder and keeps you guessing at every turn.  I'd eat here regularly if I could.  But I'll settle for what was not only my best Restaurant Week experience of all time, but my favorite restaurant experience of all time.  Hands down.
1 I was there last night for restaurant week also expecting to be impressed. I had heard about this place for awhile and was excited to try this unique way of cooking. I am not a food snob, but I was very disappointed in the size. I understand the creativeness of these types of dishes, but what a joke for the price. I felt like I was on a hidden camera show.Food tasted good, but you do not get much of anything. Way too much money. The tea they give at end of meal is very nice  but, nobody came back to show us how to pour it. The tea pot was very unique, but couldn't figure out how to open it.The place looks a bit out of date.  I appreciate the experience. I would hope for a bit more next time for that price.
5 Once again Binkleys is the best dining experience you will find in the valley.  Are the portions small? Yes.  Is it pricey (considering portion size)? Sure.  Will you find another restaurant in the valley with the amount of innovation and attention to detail as Binkleys? No.    Binkleys is a place every person who enjoys a unique dining experience should try. It's a restaurant you must experience at least once.
4 At the end of Arizona Restaurant weeks, we finally went to Binkley's. 40 minutes drive should make easily make anyone disappointed if foods are not superior. My overall impression will be good, interesting, small portion but not that impressive. Drinks: Strawberry perfection: use liquid nitrogen to freeze the upper layer of this drink. [4]  Amuse bouche: Duck consomme: salty, rich and taste great. [4] Miniature sloppy Joe: tiny bugger with sour vegetable.  [3.5] Frozen peach arnold palmer: freeze juice.[3.5]  The first course: Smoked Sweet Pea Vichyssoise. [forgot] Citrus cured salmon, horseradish salmon caviar, white wine gelee:  Salty and savory with a sour taste from caviar. Green foam filled into the bowl. [4] Blueberry-Midori Bomb: an interesting dish with juicy blueberry juice wrapped in a spoon with lemon and olive oil. [4]  Second course: herb roasted leg, garlic braised shoulder, mustard spaetzle, summer squash: roasted garlic tastes and smells great. Meat are tender.[3.5]  Third course: Lemon glazed donut holes: sour, sweet. [3.5] Freezing strawberry soup: use liquid nitrogen to freeze and dehydrate fruits. Interesting[4] Macaroons: good taste.[3.5]
5 Our group of four attended for "Restaurant week" as one of our group has always wanted to try. We got a late reservation and made the drive.  From the outside the place doesn't look like much and you might pass it by. The interior is well designed and decorated.  The food was all extremely delightful. This place is as much about the experience as it is the food.  We had several (6? 7?) courses and each was very small and presented perfectly. The food is not for the un-adventurous types. It is best described as French fusion/molecular gastronomy. We ended up full by the end but this is not comfort food nor heavy food.  We enjoyed the cheeses, the salmon vichyssoise, amuse bouche, lamb, hibiscus tea, frozen strawberry desert and macaroons. There were more but I lost count.  Each was served and explained in depth by the very courteous and attentive staff. Each was paired perfectly and the wine was explained in depth as well. This brings me to my next point. The staff was excellent. I had forgotten what truly excellent service is.  They made it a point to explain in depth each course. When they approached the table they allowed us to finish our table discussion and waited to be acknowledged rather than interrupting. They were friendly without trying to be our friend. This was very refreshing.  After nearly 2 1/2 hours our meal came to an end and it seemed like 15 minutes, which is testament to the pace and service as well as the food.  Word of caution, this is not the average establishment and they don't charge average prices. Expect $100/pp minimum. The dress while upscale was not pompous. There were suits and ties and ladies dressed well yet this is Cave Creek and there were Levis and boots as well.  I can whole-heartedly recommend Binkleys. Be adventurous and have some fun.
5 What a dining experience! My husband and I had so much fun dining here and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great date night out. Each dish is meticulously prepared and presented so beautifully. You get a huge range of flavors and foods over the course of an evening (be prepared for a 3 hour dinner) with some science/food lessons to boot! I didn't necessarily love every single dish, but everything is served in small portions and there are many different kinds so the point is to go on a flavor adventure and get to try lots of different things. Also, this is a great place for vegetarians! Mushroom/black truffle risotto seems to be the single vegetarian dish normally offered at nice restaurants...but at Binkeley's the kitchen prepares so many different and exciting dishes (admittedly many with the addition of truffle oil but that is nothing to complain about).   I really had a great time eating here and can't wait for the next big special occasion that merits a trip back to Binkley's!
5 My girlfriend and I came to Binkley's during restaurant week to celebrate our 3 year anniversary, and see if Binkley's lived up to everything we've heard about it.  Binkley's exceeded my already high expectations.  Incredible food, knowledgeable and friendly service, and an intimate atmosphere make Binkley's a visit to remember.  The restaurant week menu provided a multi-course (7 or 8 dishes) menu that delights the palette.  The foam pea vichyssoise with wasabi infused salmon roe was particularly delicious.  Binkley's takes a refined, modern approach to classic dishes and uses molecular gastronomy in exciting ways to play with textures and flavors.  The small restaurant only has about 8 or 9 tables inside, as well as a small patio outside so you definitely want to make reservations.  If you can't make it during restaurant week, then the tasting menu is probably the way to go since you can experience all that Binkley's has to offer.  While expensive, the food and service is well worth the money; and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a special night out, or any foodie who enjoys molecular gastronomy at its best.  I will most definitely be back!
5 Amazing!!!  The attention to detail and creativity are unparalleled in Arizona - also the staff is very friendly and welcoming.
2 The dreaded letdown Restaurant Week experience...  From the moment we stepped in, I was disappointed by the service. The hostess was just weird - like a hybrid of nervous and rude.  The bread course server didn't know what all breads he was offering us.  One of my friends asked for a second cocktail early in the meal.  He never got it.  And no one else was asked if they wanted a refill, even though his and others drinks were empty pretty early in the service.  There were major lapses in courses and then a few in immediate succession.  We are tasting such unique things taste, texture, and presentation-wise, that you need time between courses to discuss them with your dining mates.  Two were so rushed I never was able to hear what exactly I was eating.  At least one of my table-mates shared my frustration on that.  The unique tea contraption was placed on our table and that server walked away without an explanation.  He came back later once it was ready, but we just sort of stared at it, wondering what the heck it was and if we were supposed to divvy up the drinks?  The food WAS inventive, whimsical, fun, interesting, delish.  But crappy service ruined that to where it was actually just uncomfortable for me.  I guess the only positive about the service is that I had no problems changing out reservation count a few days prior, and that our table indeed was ready when we arrived on time.  For being one of the alleged "best" restaurants in AZ, I left wholly disappointed and know I'll never return for a special event splurge meal.  Bummer, since I've only heard such great things about this place, both for food and service.
5 Binkleys is hands down the BEST RESTAURANT IN AZ!  If you haven't been, GO...right now!  Kevin makes perfectly playful food fit for adventurous foodies.  Not only is the food perfection but the staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive.  Kevin and Amy are delights to the culinary scene and make you feel as if you are part of their family.  PS- They are happy to share any recipe if you dare to try your hand at one of their delicious dishes.
5 I am a fan of chefs tasting menu as it allows you to try a wide variety of dishes and the best dishes that the chef can offer.  It can help distinguish between a good chef and an exceptional chef.  It showcases the chefs talents and creativities.  I was thoroughly impressed with the experience we had at binkley's. One of the most memorable and one of the best chef tasting menu that I have had if not the best to date.  This restaurant is a hidden gem in the middle of nowhere. I seriously thought we were lost on the way to the restaurant.  If not for the great reviews, we would have never found our way here.  Parking can be difficult when the restaurant is packed. We parked all the way in the back in the dark since we had a later reservation. I love the warm, cozy and classy ambience. The decor included beautiful tall vases filled with water and floating flowers. The attention to details starting with the meticulous table set up. They have an iron that they used to iron the crease off your clean white table cloth that they replaced after every customer. We had to wait a bit before our table was ready but I was mesmerized with the foods being served to the seated guests that I didn't mind standing there and wait. They had a waiting area with comfortable seats but all were taken at the time.  Service was great and the servers really know the dishes very well.  We had the 6 course tasting menu but somehow it felt like it was much more. The were so many little dishes that I lost count.  Every dishes from main dishes to palate cleanser were different, tasted wonderful and the presentation of every dishes were absolutely beautiful like a piece of art. I felt like every dish was very well thought out from the pairing of the ingredients that compliments each other to bring together a wonderful tasting and innovative dish to the careful and amazing presentation that heighten all of your senses ...sight, smell and taste.  There wasn't one dish that I did not like.    When I have the opportunity to visit Phoenix/ Scottsdale, Arizona again or anywhere in Az that is within driving distance, I definitely will make plans to visit Binkley's again. Definitely a must try restaurant!
1 Terrible, ordered foie gras and it was the worst. Don't order this.yuck. The hype is just hype.
4 I would give this place a 4,5 rating if that was possible but a 5? Hmm not quite there yet.......    We had the 5 course tasting menu and hands down, it was really good!   *Palm of hearts salad with raspberries, kiwis and lots of other tasty treats was a work of art. Probably one of the most beautiful appetizers i have had. It tasted just fine but looked even better.   *Boudin blanc of veal and rabbit with chantarelles and truffle.  This was one of my favourites and the boudin blanc was great in texture and flavor and the chantarelles and truffles went really good with the dish.   *Salmon with condiments.  The salmon was pan seared and had a wonderful texture and perfectly cooked. It came with a sweet pepper sauce that worked great with the fish.   *Filé mignon. A small tiny bit of tender meat with some kind of marrowbone reduction and sweet potatoes 3 ways. A nice dish but a little tiny and not as good as the salmon.   *For dessert i had white chocolate semifreddo with foam of passionfruit.  I dont think the taste of the passionfruit went so well with the semifreddo wich by the was also was tiny.    I think we got about 6-7 Amuse bouche as well as the food above, some better then others.  I cant really complain about free dishes or the fun whimsical style of the amuses but i can offer some advise when i compare this great little restaurant to other similar restaurants ive been to that has recieved that 1 or even 2 stars from Guide Rouge, Michelin or what you prefer to call it.    Cut down the amount of amuse bouche to maybe 3-4 and make half of them (at least) savory. The feeling we got was that almost all the small dishes where sweet. It would have been great with a small amuse bouche with meat, fish or even seafood,    And even though the waiters/waitresses are very friendly and does a good job they really could use more time explaining all these advanced dishes so people who eats there would get the most of the experience. We had two charming young boys (sons of Mr Binkley himself perhaps) who served us some of the dishes and they described the dishes so fast we where sitting there looking at each other when they left wondering what they just put in front of us. I think you really have to know the food and how its prepared on a "fine dining" place like this as its more the complete experience then only the food that counts.   Pricewise its not cheap but at 79 $ for 5 dishes (+ many small treats) + drinks, tax & tips its much cheaper then it would be here in Scandinavia.   Im sure if Chef Binkley keeps refining the dishes and sharpens the waitstaff this place could get a star in the future. I recomend it anyway for the good food and nice ambiance even though Cave Creek is a bit out from civilisation.
3 Very good food. Menu selection is quite small, and service when i went was not that hot. I was impressed by the food, but everything else not so much.  Maybe it was a bad night for binkleys? I will maybe try it again to see. Over kinda disappointed.
5 After hearing so many people speak of Binkley's like it's all rainbows and butterflies, I will admit that the phrase, "overrated," probably crossed my mind several times. I just did not think that a restaurant could live up to so much, especially with the pricing. However, Binkley's really pulled through on my hubby and my anniversary. We chose the 6 course tasting menu. They neatly gave us a copy of our menu neatly scrolled up with the date and "Happy 6th Anniversary" below.  Wine pairing with our meal which was an additional $50 per person. Yes, we did that too, but it seemed worth it.  1st Course - Cold Appetizer: -Slow Cooked Short Rib Carpaccio - braised lotus root, snow pears, lychee, fairy squash, maple-wasabi, and sweet soy.    -Menage a Foie - chicken terrine, vanilla mousse, spicy white chocolate truffle, croutons, arugula, plum mustard, licorice.  My husband is really into terrines so he really loved this appetizer. The arrangement was very artistic that eventually resembled an art deco piece.    2nd Course - Hot Appetizer: -Black Truffle and Sweet Corn Risotto - shaved Australian winter truffles, shrimp, chanterelle mushrooms, summer squash, and parmesan cheese. The young waiter actually shaved the black truffles in front of me with white gloved hands. You know that movie, Jerry Meguire, when she says, "You had me at hello?" Well, Binkley's unforgivingly won me over with those black truffles!  -Lobster Ravioli - clamshell mushrooms, radish, garlic, eggplant, and tomatillo. For something so little, it packed so much flavor and was rich and buttery.   3rd course - Fish -Coho Salmon Steak - bacon wrapped giant gnocchi, lemon rapini, spaghetti squash, and sweet pepper vinaigrette. I actually was more impressed by the bacon wrapped giant gnocchi - it was like a buddy whom you haven't seen in several years and you taste it, and you think, "Where have you been all my life?"  -Horseradish Crusted Halibut - cavatelli, broccoli, leeks, mirepoix, cabbage, white wine tomato broth. I stole a bite of this halibut and I was immediately jealous that I didn't order this instead of the salmon, but then I second guessed, because had I not ordered that salmon, then I wouldn't have met my bacon wrapped gnocchi.   4th course - Meat:  -Duck - mesquite seared breast served on a dish with green onion, butternut squash and foie gras vinaigrette. A duck confit with egg and other ingredients came in a separate adorable creme brulee type serving dish, but the lid was an actual ceramic duck. The duck breast was already cut into large cubes and cooked to perfection. I love duck, and this is one of the best preparations I've had - the texture and flavor in perfect harmony together.   -Red Wine Poached Filet Mignon - sea beans, sweet potato, haricots verts, pearl onion, shiso, yuzu-beef broth.  It's the first time I've ever seen the hubs eat anything slow since he truly wanted to savor each bite! (He usually houses food down in seconds!)   5th Course - Cheese -Truffle Fondue - Oh my goodness! Really, you took a fondue and added truffles?! I was in heaven eating this fondue. I was given an assortment of fruit, nuts, and popcorn to dip in my mini truffle fondue.   -Cheese platter for the hubs - You get to choose 3 types of cheeses to go with a platter of cheese, nuts, and fruits. I remembered the porter cheese being really delicious.   6th Course - Dessert Sweet Potato Bread Pudding - We both had the same. Both had "Happy Anniversary" written in chocolate in delicate cursive handwriting.   Interspersed throughout our entire dinner event, we were given amuse bouches galore: -Home made uniquely shaped and flavored chips with a cream moose -Szechuan peppered peach soup -Mini, almost nano sized, sloppy joe -Tomatillo panna cotta with bacon and onion -Watermelon papaya fettuccini -Pickled chanterelle mushrooms in a sherry sauce -Heirloom tomato salad flash frozen with mozerella foam -Cherry "bomb" encapsulation iwth pepper oil fresno chili oil inside -Lemon glaze ball shaped donuts -Vanilla macaroon with chooclate malt butter cream (the last amuse at the very end!)  In addition to these tastes, they served us a hibiscus tea that helps with digesting all the food just gluttonously devoured served in what resembled something straight out of my college chemistry lab. It caught everyone's eye. They also brought "disco shots" over flashing LED lights. I laughed with delight, because honestly in a restaurant that seemed so sophisticated, I did not expect them to throw in some fun. Another thing that surprised me was how young some of the wait staff is. The ones that served us our food looked so young, yet they had so much knowledge about the food and were just so polite. I can safely say we are both on the Binkley "band wagon" now and I'll admit that I'm not ashamed to say they proved me wrong. They are well deserving of their high ratings in my book.
5 Like I said before Binkley's is an exsperience that can't be compared to any other and is certainly memorable. You just don't go here on a whim as it is a special destination kind of place. You go here to celebrate something and spend about twice as you would for a regular nice dinner out. The seats here are NOT created equal as you might get a little squashed in table nested by a busy waiter's stand or a spacey roomy semi private table pushed away from all the action. You don't go out to eat here, you go here to dine and your stay will last two and a half to maybe three hours. Binkley's doesn't have the finest atmosphere as it is a small restaurant located in a small strip mall but the exsperience here is special and the food is in general unexpected, playful and presented in magnificent ways. Some dishes involve molecular gastronomy and are presented like a science experiment.  You have a choice of different ways to order either a la carte, multiple tasting menus and wine options that are paired expertly and not average.  Binkley's is well known for enhancing your meal with many Amuse Bouche and when I say many it really is over a dozen and maybe around twenty different ones. That are micro sized and look like they belong in doll houses. One plate was playing card sized and had a sloppy joe the size of a short fingernail with a waffled fan potato chip standing up on the plate. (sadly this photo was one of many that didn't come out)   I enjoyed everything but some dishes stood out more than others for me.  A dish that packed a big wallop of flavors was the Australian Black Truffle and Sweet Corn Risotto. I'm a sucker for real truffles and these were fresh and not dried up like from other places I had truffled dishes. The plate was a wonderful flavor and texture combination that surely was a pleaser.  It might not be for everyone but I enjoyed the Seared Hamachi Au Poivre. It was a little spicy from the seven peppers and sort of melted in the mouth. It almost was like a really good steak but lighter. This plate also visually interesting and had many textures. This is a new dish for them.  The staff was very well orchestrated and extremely professional.
5 I wish there were 6 stars!  What creative and delicious food!   Every dish is a surprise.   A cherry pop!  Plum & pomegranate consommé with curried shrimp.  Brasied short ribs that were stunning.  Every bite leaves you wanting more.  And, flawless service with a packed house.      We've tried several other "good" restaurants in Arizona.  There is simply no comparison.  Binkley's is the best.
5 Not much else to add from my previous outing other than its still the best and still my goto restaurant if I had to have one last meal before I die.  The restaurant week menu for the fall was phenomenal from the squash soup to the boston cream pie.  The wine pairings went perfectly with each course and the brioche bread is still mindblowing.  The staff remains knowledgable and helpful without being intrusive and the menu continues to deliver surprise after delicious surprise.  Truly an Arizona gem that everyone should try at least once in their lives.  I for one plan to try it again and again many more times before my time on Earth has passed.
3 We were so excited to try Binkley's and with Restaurant week as it made it a great way to experience this heralded restaurant. The location is a bit lacking and the seating options are limited but I think that is known as part of their charm.  Our amuse bouche started off with a wonderful butternut squash soup in a maple sugar rimmed mini-mug. Then amazing frozen Greek salad balls on a spoon - they just melted into a wonderful burst of all those flavors. A mini-muffaletta with caper berry and tiny potato chip was fun but not very memorable. (we missed the fired okra with aerated Ranch that was on the menu).  My wife did have one of their signature cocktails and I enjoyed the wine pairing along with each course. (sweet pinot noir sparkling wine to start).   After all that our first course came, a chilled plum consommé with a few unique combination of little touches of shrimp, kiwi, pomegranate and a "smear" of avocado. My wife described the consommé as similar to a really sweet cough syrup. Ok, we pushed on.  The second amuse bouche was a sweet cherry bomb with what was to be a firecracker ver jus. A literal explosion (of sweet) in your mouth. Then, to clense our pallet, a sugary ginger-lime soda.   The main course was braised beef short rib with the usual potato, mushroom, mire poix touches. Texture was great. Nothing outside the box here - rather rich, very salty.  So, of course, you need another amuse bouche prior to dessert. These are always fun and what Binkley's is known for. It is a very generous experience (especially at only $40 for Restaurant week). But, as you guessed it, did we need a lemon glazed donut hole along with a sweet herbal tea made table-side? (since we don't eat much sugar, I'm starting to shake at this point).  The third course, dessert showed itself as a caramel Boston Crème pie parfait with dark chocolate, custard, etc. Presentation was in a small glass so you could see the layers - nothing unique and the flavor was just fine, not something to say much about. (although, I only managed two bites of this sweet treat in order to taste each layer - I had to finish my dessert wine).  Got our bill, all was well. Service was amazing - very thorough but a bit overly energetic. We paid and oh, wait, I still have to eat this final amuse bouche - a mini macaroon. Nice call the day after to make sure we enjoyed our dinner. Try it!
5 Surprised its not a 5 star. Binkley's is an experience in creativity of unique dishes starting from the first course through the last. My wife and I spent a total of 2 1/2 hrs there and enjoyed every min. I believe the number of tables to be around 27 with a staff of 27 so we felt special but not smothered (half the staff is kitchen) We had the pleasure of meeting the head chef Keith which along with his wife that manages the staff are owners. They were very appreciative of sharing their restaurant with us. The appearance inside was warm and inviting with art and lighting and the staff was knowledgeable,friendly and kind. This is a special place to share with a loved one.
5 This was our third visit to Binkley's and it still does not disappoint. I would have to say that this is our favorite restaurant in Arizona and only regret that it is a good hour drive from where we live since it is located in northern Phoenix in a city called Cave Creek. We have found the food there to be on par with the best restaurants we have dined at, the service impeccable, and the experience always memorable. The location is probably not what you would expect for a fine dining establishment because it is located in a strip mall but once you are seated and start eating you easily forget where you are located. The price is expensive for dinner, but for a fine dining tasting menu I find it to be very reasonable when compared to others of equal caliber. Be sure to make a reservation at least a week in advance because seating is limited and you might not be able to get in on the day you want.  We always go for the wine pairing and find that the sommelier Ryan is probably the best we have seen in the business. He is very knowledgeable about the wines he chooses for the pairings and they do pair very well with the food. He brings each wine out along with the appropriate glass and explains each one, including the vineyard, location, and year before he pours for your. The pours are generous and interactions with Ryan are very informative. He truly makes the dining experience enjoyable.   We usually opt for the 5-course tasting menu but you could also choose the 4-course or 6-course. Before the courses are served they start you off with a plethora of amuse bouche dishes. Now most of these are small, but after all they are amuse bouche and only meant to stir up your appetite. While most establishments only gives you about 1-2 amuse bouche, Binkley's surpasses them all with about 8 of them throughout your whole meal.   The courses rarely disappoint and are very creative. We truly enjoy the molecular gastronomy Chef Binkley incorporates into his dishes and also like the ability to have different people order different dishes so that we can get a taste of a variety of dishes. Most other restaurants with tasting menus only have one set menu with each person getting the same dish with each course. This makes our dining experience that much more rich and memorable as we try different dishes and different wines. The food is phenomenal and we recently had the opportunity to try some wagyu beef that he imported from Japan. AMAZING!  I am looking forward to our next meal there and hope that one day Chef Binkley will expand his restaurant to include a chef's table. When he does so, you can expect me to be one of the first in line for a seat at that table. Bon appetite!   Visited December 2012
5 With out a doubt one of the most spectacular meals that you will ever have. Came here to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday and we both ordered the 5 course meal, but chose different items so it turned out to be a 10 course extravaganza.   Started off with the Cold Appetizer - Duck Cinnamon Breast and Shaved Tuna which was presented very well and great combination of vegtables and spices.  The Hot Appetizers - Black Truffle & Sweet Corn Risotto and Glazed Lobster Mushrooms were awesome. The Risotto was like a corn chowder and the mixture of the Shaved Burgundy Truffles, Shrimp, Chanterelle Mushrooms & Summer Squash made this one of the premier items in the meal  Fish Entree - Hamachi Au Poivre and Wild Mushroom Dusted Monkfish were both new to us but were delish! The Monkfish was complimented with Maitake Mushrooms, grits, rapini and Harissa while the Hamachi had Baby Bok Choy, Oyster Mushrooms Black Beans and an interesting slice fried avocado.  Meat Entree - Red Wine Poached Filet Mignon and Foie Gras Stuffed Quail were presented and prepared spectacular. The Filet was complimented  sweet potatoes, matsutake mushrooms and eggplant  The biggest surprise was the number of Amuse Bouche that was served throughout the meal, where there was always something on the table to eat for a solid 2 and a half hours. The Amuse Bouche items were Butter Nut Squash Soup, Sloppy Joe sandwich the size of a nickel, House Waffle Chip, Caper, Home made Breads - Sour Dough Fruit and Pickled, Cherry Shooter, Hibiscus Tea,  Pineapple Cocktail Shooter Lava Lamp and Homemade Donuts. The Cherry Shooter was amazing that when placing it in the mouth the cherry just dissolved into liquid form, the Hibiscus Tea came out in a apuratus that looked like a chemistry lab with a seperate burner and as the water was heated it rose to the herbs in a seperate container and mixed the liquid to form the tea. The most entertaining one was certainly the Pineapple Cocktail Lava lamp where the Pineapple Cocktail is in a shot glass size glass placed on top of a lighted coaster.  Service was incredible how the drinks were always filled, the proper silverware was changed to go with your next entree and the explanations of each dish explained.  Located in Cave Creek, so if you even live in North Scottsdale, it is a good drive to the restaurant.   Without a doubt a memorable meal and would recommend to anyone who would appreciate the fine dining. Unless you have unlimited $, not a place the average person could afford to visit weekly. Is a great place for very special occasions to remember. The 5 course meal depending which one you get is $91 per person without drinks.  Will certainly go here again, just need to save some money for the next visit.
5 fantastic food, 10  amuses with the 5  course tasting.  friendly but some green & young  waitstaff. dates decor  but  otherwise a great gem in az!  ps  you could wear jeans and not feel out of place
5 I chose this restaurant for my 50th birthday and it was well worth it!    We arrived about 15 minutes prior to our 5:30 reservation and were promptly seated.  We were made aware that being we were celebrating my birthday, that we would be receiving a personalized menu - pretty cool touch there!  We opted to do the 4 course small plates w/o wine pairing.  We both ordered different items so we could share.   Cold Appetizers:  Chevre Stuffed Dates - sweet tasting!  Cherry Smoked Lamb Tartare - wonderful veggies!  Hot Appetizers:  Ricotta Dumplings - again, sweet tasting!  Porcini Mushroom Soup - tasty, but a little rich for my taste.  Entrees - Filet Migon - fingering potatoes were wonderful and the horseradish froth was too cool!  Skate (a ray fish) was very tasty!  Desserts: Squash cheesecake (very rich with a birthday banner and candle) and Sour Apple Sorbet - really cool presentation.  Highlights of food served between courses - a soup that was served in espresso cups (unfortunately, I cannot remember the name - it tasted like gingerbread and was to die for!), mango bombs, lava lamp shots, hibiscus tea, mini sloppy joes and the bread.  The service was excellent and we appreciated the explanation of all our dishes and every staff member wished me a happy birthday.  It was probably one of the coolest dining experiences we have had in a long time and well worth the cost.  My husband received a follow-up phone call thanking us for dining there as well as a survey.  Highly recommend!!
5 Another fantastic dining experience at Binkleys! We would again be overly satisfied and stuffed this evening thank u hubby for the nice Eve surprise.   Thoroughly enjoyed tonite's serving of foie especially as the macadamian nut butter was a divine pairing to balance the richness.   The appetizer of geoduck was also profound as I was surprised to see it garnished around the plate with a refined texture that seemed as if the clam was massaged for hours. Coupled with the tender daikon, lovely shimeji, ponzu foam and the chef's miso base it brought nice washoku flavors to our delight. Also the trout was excellent in its soup base with white beans ah I soooo need to return to my pescaterian ways.  The amuses were also a knockout in sophistication, Chef Binkley always embodies the most intriguing creativity in those in between meal details and tonight the assortment of fruit melodies found its way into every small serving, most noticeably the fresh nitrogenized pearls of citrus fruit. He owns palate cleansing 101!  Service was on point and it seems the Chef duly is an advocate for refining our youth as he has employed a nice fleet of politely trained servers, some I could hardly believe have yet to grow from their boyish soprano pitched voices, cuteness points earned.  One of the best main courses we've had thus far here was the duo of elk. I felt the sear and the braised preparation were magnificent, not over nor undercooked, an homage to the protein. Lastly the demi glacé I wish I could bottle up and sell, so finger licking scrumptious and don't mention the candied bacon or the population of Phoenix might be moving up to Cave Creek tomr!!  Well done, merci! Joyeux Noël :)
5 If you want to impress, celebrate, a foodie or experience fine dining - Brinkley's is thee place.  The ambiance isn't anything to write home about, but the presentation of each plate, flavors, incredible teasers in between make it so unforgettable.  I have been here about a handful of times and have been consistently blown away.   Expect to be there for at least 2-hours, which makes it even more memorable.  No rush, just savory each bite.
2 For Arizona Restaurant Week we were resolved to finally experience Binkley's; it has taken me a bit of time to reflect on my meal as this was in May of 2013, but I want my comments to be thoughtful and not reactionary.  I will say first off, that it is a bit of a drive to Binkley's from Central Phoenix, but travel is always worth it for an exception meal and culinary experience.   My expectation going into Restaurant Week is that I get a flavor of what the regular menu is all about, really draw from the Chef/Owner/Restaurant's culinary point of view.  The reason why this review has taken so much time is that even today, looking back at my notes and my impressions, I am still absolutely utterly confused.  On similar experiences to places like Crudo during Restaurant Week I got what Crudo was all about, there was a flavor, there was a style and I subsequently went back and experienced a more focused meal.  Upon my arrival and review of the evenings meal I quickly became aware that the presentation for Restaurant Week was not a sampling of the menu nor could I identify any parallels between the point of view of the regular menu and this special menu.  So from the moment I sat at the very table I was absolutely confused and I believe Binkley's is equally confused about the intent of Restaurant Week which is to present your culinary point of view.  All I want to know from Binkley's is: WHO ARE YOU?    Sadly, by the last bite of desert and the last sip of drink I found myself utterly confused by what I had eaten and why I had even bothered to dine there.    I used to frequent Michael's at the Citadel when it was open, I loved that place, there was never a misunderstanding on the style, taste or confusion about the meal I had enjoyed.  Very few establishments edited themselves as well as Michael's, it was an incredible meal, incredible flavor and an incredible experience.    When I go to a business like Binkley's that has an incredible reputation, well recognized and well thought of, I expect the same level of excellence and point of view.  I looked forward to Binkley's to be tight in its menu and its offering and because it was so sloppy I was thrown into this vast chasm of culinary chaos.    The most laughable moment came quickly as we were served a miniature sloppy joe.  By miniature I dont just mean small, I mean something that would be a medium sized sandwich of a GI Joe action figure (circa 1970's for fairness not the 1980's mini figures).  I literally thought it was a joke at first and once I realized it was not and tasted the miniature 'delight' I was underwhelmed by the flavor, but very impressed that you could create a sandwich so small with oyster cracker sized buns.    I have an absolute aversion to the concept of foam.  I feel that flavor infused foam is one of the biggest culinary frauds to perpetrate the foodie scene today.  Imagine my surprise and disgust when the vichyssoise consisted of a bowl full of green, salty and absolutely repulsive foam.  I do not have many visceral reactions to many things, but the moment I saw the foam pouring into my table mates bowl all I could see was red.  This is a trend, this is not even a good trend and there are many establishments that find/found foam to be in vogue in 2012/2013, but it is a silly, tasteless and faux culinary delight.  I have seen so many places, especially French establishments, follow this absurd, dainty trend and charge a premium to the patrons for the experience.  As I mentioned, I rarely have such a primal response to these things, but it is a fraud and for the first time in my life I excused myself from the table for the entire course in fear that I might have a more public, vocal reaction.  I left the green foam to sit and be whisked away the staff as I enjoyed some fresh air.  The good:  I did enjoy the Pillsbury wine selection and enjoyed a few glasses of the delightful wine.  The staff was overall pleasant, but even service could not save this meal.    In my final analysis: Binkley's has burned a bridge with me, I don't want to hear the establishments name and I will not try Binks and I really don't care how many people tell me how great it is.  Kevin Binkley needs to understand that Restaurant Week is an opportunity to show your customers who you are as a chef, your establishments point of view and to make people want more.  Not only is Binkley's menu for this occasion discombobulated, but also in the intent of their participation in Restaurant Week.  It is not to show off how special or cleaver you are Mr. Binkley, it is for customers to understand and hopefully appreciate your taste.
4 My friends spoke HIGHLY of Binkley's so when I finally went on New Years Eve, I had HIGH expectations. The service was superb and we were greeted, seated, and served immediately with a reservation. We got the New Years Eve 7 course meal with "surprises" which took about 2 hours to consume. I enjoy the unique presentation.. some odd liquid potato soup in test tubes (mine tasted burnt, my husband claims his was fine), funky fish and mushroom soup in a bag. It's hard to remember what they actually were with their fancy words but it was all tasty enough and overall FUN & UNIQUE experience. The mango ball sak thing was super!!!! As far as taste, I've had more mouth watering mind-blowing food at other top restaurants, but I'm super glad I experienced Binkley's.
5 Binkley's is the best restaurant in Arizona.  Chef Kevin Binkley is a culinary genius.  He is creative, imaginative and elegant in his execution.  His staff is well trained.  Pricing is always relative to what you receive in return for your hard earned money.  And while some may consider Binkley's to be expensive, the fact is his patrons are robbing him blind.  The food is of the highest quality, carefully crafted with wizard-like skill, and you receive incredible value.  Comparable restaurants in our greatest food cities, e.g. NY, San Fran, Chicago cost 3-5 times as much as Binkley's.  So go and enjoy!  We are lucky to have Kevin here.
5 Binkley's was an incredible experience of a night that I can't seem to shut up about. I'm telling any sad schmo who happens to make eye contact with me for too long about it, regardless of if I know them or not. We had the pleasure of dining here on Valentine's night and the place was busy with laughter and chit chat, just about the perfect amount of background noise to accompany our evening. I won't begin to even attempt listing the 15, 16 ,17, or so plates that were brought out to us, nor the several drinks we had, plenty of others have well documented each and every dish... I'll keep this nice and simple. Me and my wife had an unbelievable evening, we ate every morsel that came our way, drank every drop we got our hands on, laughed, talked with staff, and enjoyed ourselves immensely. Without question, you need to come to Binkley's at least once, we have already had several conversations on when we could come back, but do yourself a favor and experience Binkley's at least one time.
2 So...BInkley's was all puffed up with not much to show for it.  WE heard amazing things but our experience felt like being ripped off by the finest con artists out there. The waiters have a great script and the emphasis on the little micro treats between courses doesn't make up for the microscopic portions of this "tasting menu".  We hold as our standard for a tasting menu Barbara Lynch's Mentons in Boston.  While each of their portions are elegantly small, there's more than one bite. What irritated me most was the waiters fine monologue about the merits of Japanese Cobe beef which justified a 17 dollar surcharge on an already expensive menu.  When it arrived, it was delicious but I fight to make it more than one bite. Forget the theatrics Binkley's.  People want to feel fed and nurtured after a meal, not conned.  This chef has great technical acumen but NO HEART. If you're hungry, steer clear of BInks!
5 Special occasion tasting menus are a dime-a-dozen across the resort restaurants and fine dining establishments across the Phoenix metro area. I hesitate at taking the bait and buying into a $80+ per person dining experience that has in past experiences left me less than satisfied. The problem with the experience is not necessarily the restaurant itself, but the mass produced and sometimes simplified menu that caters to an audience that is typically much larger than the restaurant is accustomed to handle. Case in point: T. Cooks, an otherwise excellent restaurant, left a poor impression due to slow service and cold food back on Valentine's Day 2013.  So when I decided to book a $145 per person Valentine's Day dinner at Binkley's, I had my reservations that it might not hit the high expectations it had set from the hype I've heard about the restaurant and the chef. I thought to myself, my first experience there should probably be on an average night rather than a pre-fab menu experience. I cannot tell you how happy I am to report that I was wrong. It managed to pull off the second best dining experience I've had in Arizona and undoubtedly one of the top-ten meals I've ever had.  Starting with the service, the wait staff was attentive, friendly, and unbelievably accommodating. Another Phoenix area restaurant, Kai at the Wild Horse Sheraton, should be considered to have only marginally better service. To put it into perspective, Kai took the prestigious top honors of best service in the USA last year on Open Table. Binkleu's knocked the service out of the park by employing a huge staff to roll out the meals in perfect timing and included perks that are only part of the finer dining experiences - e.g. replace napkin upon using the restroom, new and highly customized silverware for each course.  Absolutely nothing bad can be said about the unbelievably creative and diverse meal that was served over the next two hours. While the tasting menu listed 6 courses, there ended up being a total of 19 individual rounds including appetizers, amuse-bouches, digestives, and palate cleansers. One element of surprise throughout the courses was the use of molecular gastronomy such as foams and liquid nitrogen, which was very well executed.   From the six main courses, the highlights included a savory and not too overpowering black truffle winter vegetable soup, a delicate scallop on the half-shell with citrus flavored foam, and Wagyu beef prime rib with scalloped potatoes. Stand-out intermediary dishes included an intensely flavored micro-sized sloppy joe sandwich and a flash frozen vegetable medley. Each of the dishes were well sequenced - when a meal includes so many rounds, it is impressive when the meal can tell a story across the meats, vegetables and starches served.  Upon leaving the restaurant, I was satiated and not overstuffed. 19 rounds may seem like overkill, but consider that a majority of the dishes could be eaten in just a couple bites. It allowed a first time Binkley's diner such as myself to try a vast array of the offerings, exemplifying their culinary capabilities. The restaurant catered to every aspect a diner would want for a special occasion and more importantly (for them), I left longing to come back to try the food again.  Rounds: (Main courses marked with asterisk)     1. Fried Chips - Snake skin, dill pickle, bacon, chard, dried soy milk   2. Lamb Consume   3. Miniature sloppy joe   4. Warm soaked prune (curved fork)   5. *Cauliflower carpaccio   6. Flash frozen winter vegetable medley (curved spoons)   7. *Black truffle winter vegetable soup   8. Mango bomb (Japanese spoon)   9. *Scallop on the half shell   10. Tangelo soda   11. *Wagyu beef prime rib   12. Creme Fraiche with carbonated grape   13. *Warm open faced sandwich   14. Cranberry consume   15. Hickory smoked creme brûlée   16. Hibiscus tea - Coffee syphon   17. *Freezing strawberries   18. Macaroon  Note: I missed one round from the above list. It was a flash-fried fish chip towards the beginning of the meal.
5 Place for special occasion for people that love great food very expensive
4 awesome food. one of a good dining experience with excellent service. the food is a tad salty for my taste, I wish they use more natural ingredient other than Salt. presentation was great and cooked my filet to perfection. the meat on the other hand, had a few gristle. :( that seems awful.. I would try a different meat dishes, but they should monitor their steak quality..
2 I'm so confused: I loved almost everything they served, but with muddy clouds of too much wine (I had the 4-course tasting with wine), I am having a hard time remembering much. In short, Binkley's is dated, and overkill. I get it: you're an amazing chef. But the appeal leaves me flattened, as I was simply overwhelmed by the attentive, almost constant battery to my tastebuds. A couple of amuse were way too salty; like the lamb consomme; and really? You need to boil the tea at my table? I was expecting Uncle Moe to come out with a sparkler hat at any minute...  Sadly, I have experienced better. You want spoons in 2014? Go to Nobu at Teeter House. Check out the Blue Hound.   Binkleys: GET RID of the maroon-printed ribbons. By then end of the night I felt like I was leaving the most overdone french-catered Bar Mitzvah of 1989. Peanuts? In a bag? with a ribbon and your name? They are outdated. Even the waitresses' attire reminded me of Melanie Griffith in Working Girl. Ugh.  And...wait for it: $278 + tip (so almost $350) for two. The nerve.
5 This place is an incredible dining experience. My husband and I each had the tasting menu paired with wine. He had the 6 course and I had the 4, he also added the ginger beer which was delicious! We had such a wonderful time, the staff was helpful and friendly but not intrusive. The food was full of great surprises. We couldn't wait to see how each course would be presented and prepared. Each dish was unique and so flavorful. We also enjoyed to mini dishes that came at the beginning of the meal and the palette cleansers that came in between each course. We were lucky to have the patio all to ourselves and truly could not have asked for a better evening. At $360 for the meal (including tip) this was the most we had ever spent on a 'dinner' but worth every single penny. We will definitely go back and recommend them any chance we get.
2 My husband brought me here for my birthday, and I was very disappointed in both the service and the overall food.  The service did not meet the standards of a fine dining establishment, and the food was inconsistent (we had the 6 course tasting menu - 1 great dish, 1 good dish, 3 mediocre dishes, and 1 terrible dish;  too many bad flavor combo amuse bouches).  I thought the staff were all very nice and the food had promise so I hope the restaurant takes this feedback as constructive criticism.  Service:  - 30 min wait from when we were seated to our order being taken  - 30 min wait before a glass of wine my husband ordered arrived  - Inexperienced 'trainee' server who consistently got our dishes mixed up, sloshed the dishes so the presentation was ruined (my 'mini-sloppy joe' came out on its side); not acceptable to 'train' on a customer in a fine dining establishment!!  - I asked for water with no ice, but every subsequent pour had ice  - Dishes were often not cleared before next dish brought out  - Amuse bouche brought out before we had finished eating our dish  - Food brought out when one of us is not at the table (so no explanation of dish)  - Table not cleaned before dessert is brought out  - Napkins not refolded when we leave the table  - Forgot to give us our parting gift (had to ask for the birthday menu, forgot to ask for the gift)  Food:  - On the plus side, presentations were beautifully executed  - Here's what I ordered with wine pairing: 1) Spot Prawns: delicious 2) Foie Gras: good, banana bread side a little too sweet or could be portioned smllaer; we had really missed this coming from CA 3) Diver Scallops: Mediocre, brussle sprout extremely over salted 4) Bone Marrow Crusted Filet Mignon: Mediocre, came out cold and again over salted broccoli and some over salted purees 5) Truffle fondue 'cheese course':  terrible but I love truffles so I forced a few bites; oversalted and the accompaniments were odd (celery, popcorn, dried cranberries, dried pear); bread would have been fine 6) Bread Pudding Dessert:  Mediocre, just ok not much flavor; I tasted pudding and no bread. I have to say my husband's chocolate parfait was delicious (no explanation of the dish, but I think it had freeze dried chocolate, some cream and small chocolate balls). - Bread tasted hard and a little stale end of day?; Mastro's City Hall in Scottsdale, by comparison had far superior bread - Amuse bouche:  way too many, non that inspiring.  The mini-sloppy joe tasted stale, one 'egg yolk' concept with giant mango popping boba and curry/chili oil was particularly weird (not in pleasant way)  Wine: Apparent there was no sommelier in the house - I'm certainly not a wine connoisseur, but red wine was served very chilled, explanation for one wine was 'I read about it in a wine magazine that it would pair well' which on paper seems ok, but makes the server sound very inexperienced. On the plus side, wine pairing was only $40 which is a bargain so not complaining too much.  The chef definitely has talent, but food needs some editing and quality control, and the service needs work.
4 Short Version: Did the 6-course Tasting Menu which is spendy, but worth it. It would be a 5-star review but they were having front of the house issues and it didn't go as smoothly as they intended (which they admitted to). I got so many unique things I can barely remember what we got.  Long Version: We came here for our anniversary dinner so it was a very special occasion which helped justify the expense. You have a choice of ordering individual items from the menu, or doing a 4, 5 or 6-course tasting menu which is what they recommend. We did the 6-course which costs $95/person. You choose the 6 courses, but you get A LOT more items in between each course. All in all, we probably got around 15 items brought to our table. It was a very cool experience full of food that we had not even heard of before. The food is very inventive and the cost is worth it if not for the unique experience alone.  Everything was delicious and unique, but the stand out item for me was the Crispy Seared Foie Gras. I love that we can still get this in Arizona as opposed to it being outlawed in California which kinda makes it even cooler. If you've never had Foie Gras before, the best way I can describe it is telling you to imagine that fatty part of a really good ribeye that is a little crispy, but soft and juicy. This was the best Foie Gras I've ever had. Admittedly, I don't have THAT much experience with it, but I have to imagine this is one of the best you can get in AZ, also given that most places don't serve it.  The only reason this visit wasn't a 5-star review was because the service was lacking, BUT they were apologetic. They messed up a couple of our orders by bringing out the wrong dishes so it messed with the "perfect timing" that the server told us about at the beginning which is why they ask that you order everything all at once. The server said that it must've been an issue with the front of the house.  All in all, highly recommended. Dress is "Resort Wear" so jeans are acceptable, but would recommend at least a polo.  Of the fancier restaurants we've been two in the past couple years, this one falls top 2. Up there with Peter Luger and Gramercy Tavern.
5 This place is a flat out awesome experience.  Tasting items come out at a good pace.   5 course tasting took about two and a half hours to complete even though it felt it went much faster.  A special occasion must.
5 This place is amazing and is the best restaurant in the Phoenix/ Scottsdale area. I have been going there for 10 years and the level of service and food has never declined. Binkley's staff understands  that going there is usually a special occasion therefore you are treated accordingly. When you call for a reservation, the staff member asks if there is a special occasion for dining with them The menu reflects a personalized statement when you arrive if their is something being celebrated by your party. It's small gestures like that and the creativity of the food that make this one of my favorite places.
5 I had heard a lot about Binkley's and just hoped it would live up to the hype. We went with a party if 4 and were seated in the back room. All four of us ordered the 4 course tasting menu with wine pairing. I started with the smoked salmon appetizer followed by clam chowder, striped bass and the "carrot and peas" dessert which was actually carrot flavored ice cream topped with a cream cheese whipped cream. Each course was delicious and supplemented with several additional courses from the chef.   The service was very good, attentive but not rushed. We will definitely come back when in the area.
5 Experienced dinner last night and it was as good as the five star designation suggests. First, often the separation between excellent and average is about service. The service was perfect with the right amount of support from the primary server and the supporting cast was well taught regarding the complementary role they play. The menu was an exploration of balance and personal preferences that created a wonderful multiple course dinner.  The preparation and presentation were as good as any we've experienced anywhere. Compliments to all for a perfect evening. And finally, the intimate atmosphere had an upbeat buzz that made the evening even better.   PS:  I've had Manhattans coast to coast in some of the best establishments recognized for great cocktails. I asked for a couple of extra brandied cherries and was told they are a dollar per cherry. Never had that happen which seemed awfully chintzy given an $18 drink plus a few hundred dollars spent for the dinner.
5 Transcendent.  Sublime.  Exquisite.  Delightful.  Not often enough in life do you get to use words like this simply to describe a meal.  Thank you Binkley's & Restaurant Week for allowing a simple dude like me to experience the beauty of this incredible establishment.  I tried to think back to the number of times I had spent $40 on a bar tab or a sub-par meal + drinks in the last six months, and it was too many to count.  Here, for $40, I had one of the best five meals of my life.  The website said four courses, but with all of the surprises and treats there were no less than fifteen different tastes.  It was a carnival - not just for the mouth either.  The attention to detail and presentation is second to none.  I am talking about a jaw dropping gastronomic experience.  Twas my first time trying many of the items on the menu - but I shant go into many details because I would simply try anything prepared in that kitchen.  Every single bite had me closing my eyes and letting the food or drink take me on a tiny journey.  Kevin Binkley - take a bow sir, you are a master of your craft and I am honored to have dined in your establishment.  I will spend a moment talking about the tea that was cooked in a vacuum over a bunson burner... the vessel on top had mint, Meyer lemon, hibiscus and a touch of sugar - once the water was boiling it was sucked up with the ingredients and then slowly dripped back into the tiny teapot.  I have never in my life said "wow" for tea - until last night. #science  The dessert was a white chocolate semifreddo (fancy ice cream) and came with a yellow curry oat streusel topped with caramel chocolate sauce........ how many times have you tasted curry and said, "man I wish someone would put that in a dessert!"... it was one of my favorite bites of the entire meal.   So if you want to: ooh / ahh / drool / moan / gasp / sigh or if it is your last meal in Arizona, this is where you should go... simply as good as it gets.
5 Quite simply, the best culinary experience in all of Arizona.    Worth every penny of a tasting menu.  Yes, it's inventive, festive, with lights, color, smells, etc.  It's not as stuffy as a tasting menu in Paris (nor 1/4 as expensive).  But that's part of the experience.  Everyone should go once, for some very special occasion and with someone you care about.  Go with an open mind, experience the taste of every bite, and remember that it's experiences and memories you collect that you can recall far more than a $100 physical item such as a new purse.  Enjoy!
5 Absolutely phenomenal everything..... food, ambiance, service.   My husband and I went because friends recommended it as a great restaurant for special occasions, and now I must agree.  We went for our one year wedding anniversary and after the first little course quickly agreed that we will come here every year.  It's two months until our second year anniversary and I'm already excited by the idea of eating here again.   Just go all out and get the six course tasting menu.  We did, and we loved the additional little bites and drinks that were brought out in between the phenomenal courses.  I would pay $300 pp for this meal if Binkley's was located in Chicago. Service was excellent.  Our main server was exactly as attentive as we needed without being overbearing.  The supporting servers (including what looked like a 16  year old kid - and he knocked it out of the park) were wonderful too.   See you every year in August, Binkley's!
5 Wow. What an experience this restaurant is! I'm so happy I finally tried it! My husband and I took his mother out for her birthday and all got the 4 corse tasting menu and I was so full! Haha! I never though a ton of little dishes would fill me up but I was wrong!  This is one for the books! I would highly recommend it! Such creative little dishes will blow your mind! A great anniversary spot, date, or a romantic dinner! Make sure you look nice and make a reservation!  The service was wonderful and I am very excited to go again!
