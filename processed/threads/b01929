1 Decent dry cleaner, service I done on premises, which is nice, but prices aren't posted anywhere; when I went to pick up my clothes and they told me the total, I thought I heard them wrong. I won't be back.
1 My clothes smelled like armpits & onions when I picked them up. I will never go back.
1 Check all your items before you pay. I have gotten many items back with wrinkles ironed into them.  The only reason I take my shirts here is to have them pressed as I HATE ironing.  If I have to double check the work of a professional service then they are not worth my time.  BOTTOM LINE: Find another cleaner!!!
