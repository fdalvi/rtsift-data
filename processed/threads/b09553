4 One of the remaining shining stars of antiquery and just plain old stuff left in the Glendale antique district, Bo's is just stuffed with--well, stuff.  Radios? Check.  Glassware? several dozen shelves.  Moose head? Over in the far corner.  Mid-century furniture? In the big showroom.  Pinball? Better get there fast, it'll be gone...  You can spend half a day perusing the shelves, grazing between the aisles and piles of collectible detritus, stare in amazement at the advertising signage--all, or course, can be yours for a price.  So if you head down to Glendale sometime, be sure to stop in at Bo's. That and La Perla will make the trip worthwhile all by themselves.
5 If you enjoy kitschy, vintage toys/furniture/collectibles then you will love this store.  I have found some really awesome stuff in this store and it's by far my favorite store to hit when I'm in the downtown Glendale area.
