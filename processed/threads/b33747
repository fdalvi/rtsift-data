2 I came in to have the nose pads replaced on my glasses. The girl at the front desk was rude, because apparently the nose pads are replaced for free.  I didn't know,  I expected to pay, I guess she was rude because she either needed a sneakers or no commission from the nose pads. 2 stars for being rude 5stars for the free pads.
3 So I have new Insurance, and its time for Glasses. Customer services was good, my advise, always use the sales options to save money. And lucky for me they just happen to have my prescription for contacts in the store. Why not 4 or 5 stars? because this is not the only place in town for glasses or contacts.
1 I sat there in a chair, right next to the customer service desk, waiting for service for almost 40 MINUTES. Nobody asked my  name, or if they could help me with anything, or even if I was being helped. They just kept rushing past saying "be right with you".   Meanwhile, there are employees taking smoke breaks. WOW.  HORRIBLE customer service. I will never be back and I won't recommend this location to friends or family.
