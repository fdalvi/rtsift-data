5 Great Service! Ron and Wade did my pool in 2002 and it's still running strong. Any time I have maintenance issues, I call them and they're quick to respond. They're extremely honest telling me when parts are under warranty and giving me the contact information. as opposed to getting the part and charging me to install it. In 2010 I had them do a pool check-up on everything. There were some minor things that were needed to keep my pool at 100% which I thought was great. I appreciate their honesty and hard work. Thanks Guys!
5 I started off with eleven pool contractors but quickly narrowed it down to two.  We decided on Artistic Pools .  Wade kept in contact with us through every step of the construction. We received a fair price, quality equipment and good customer service and it was completed when he said it would be.  Training and follow-up was important because we had not owned a pool before.  A couple of small changes were made along the way so Wade had formal change orders so at the end their would no misunderstandings. Plus he's a nice guy.
5 Wade and Ron are true professionals. My pool was built on time and exactly how we planned. Great family run business!!
