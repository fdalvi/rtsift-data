4 Outpost of the LA donut shop and quite the find! Open 24/7 with a larger-than-expected selection available late in the afternoon. We sampled: old-fashioned (my barometer for a good donut), plain cake with chocolate glaze and sprinkles, raised glazed, and chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and nuts. All fresh-tasting, not greasy, and not too sweet. When looking for a place to satisfy your sweet tooth, this place is perfect!
2 It's winchell's.  It's okay, but you wonder....
3 Winchell's Donuts went extinct in my area decades ago, so I was delighted to find one across the street from the Mandalay Bay while visiting Las Vegas.  Relative peace & quiet away from the bustling mega-casinos and an inexpensive breakfast were just what I was after!  This particular store (restaurant?) is located in a strip mall, sharing space with a Subway and next door to a liquor store.  Open 24 hours a day, and cheaper than just about anything that can be found across the street in the casinos.  As for the quality of the goods here, certainly nothing special.  I had a bagel breakfast sandwich, a couple of donuts, and coffee for a grand total of about $7.50; it did the trick.
4 This location shares its area with Subway. So it always have a mixture of wonderful smells. They are usually stocked with fresh donuts and this is the only donut chain I have found to make my favorite chocolate chocolate with nuts on top. Yummy They are open 24 hrs and the staff is usually pretty friendly. You get a bakers dozen (14).  One thing if you park in the front which is a normal thing to do you may have issues with Taxi cabs because the strip of stores there is a place in there they all like hanging out!!
2 I went here to try a Winchell's Doughnut since there has not been one in my area for quite a while.  I went there around noon and asked for a glazed doughnut.  I would assume that this is the most popular and a staple of any doughnut shop. Apparently they were out of glazed doughnuts. The two stars goes to the staff, they seemed truly disappointed that there were unable to meet my pastry needs.
