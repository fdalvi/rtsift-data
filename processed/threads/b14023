5 Don and his team refinished an antique pool table for us and did an absolutely beautiful job!  They are very professional and do amazing work!
1 Don't know....they may do excellent work. I wouldn't know! When I emailed them to get an estimate for a small job, they didn't even have the courtesy to respond. Apparently, they don't want to bother with small items.
5 Excellent service and workmanship! They came to our home and picked up a dresser and crib that had much damage done from a teething child.  Within a week our furniture was returned and looked brand new.  The price was right as well!
