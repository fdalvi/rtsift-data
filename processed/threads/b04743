5 -WOW!! I didn't expect over the top, friendly service in here...I REALLY like this Baskin-Robbins!  -FRIENDLY, helpful, attentive, enthusiastic (I am speculating was the owner)...a guy that enjoyed what he was doing and really likes his customers! The kind of service that keeps you coming back...  -SUPER CLEAN! Bright & cheery B-R decor...makes you happy about having ice cream.  -LOVe their ice cream...just give me all 31 flavors as I head over to Weight Watchers...  -Convenient parking (next to Leo's Island BBQ).
3 Yum ice cream
4 Typical Baskin Robbins. Really good ice cream, service was what you'd expect from a couple of high school kids. Had a hot fudge sundae with pralines and cream and peanut butter & chocolate. I would have liked to have quarterback crunch but the sundae was still tasty. The interior is a little run down, could use a little freshening up. Overall, very nice place to have some classic Baskin Robbins ice cream.
5 Great ice cream, fantastic service. Love it. Had to also get some to take home :-)
5 I ordered a Frozen themed cake for my granddaughters birthday. The cake decorator was so flexible because I thought I was going to be able to find my own decorations (which was impossible). The staff did a beautiful job and were so friendly and wonderful.
5 Visited this location today, clean happy atmosphere and great service. They had quite a few options to choose from, something for everyone, highly recommend the chocolate fudge ice cream, wish they had had pecans but they only had almonds today.
5 Great options tonight, enjoyed the no sugar added options, you can still enjoy ice cream without all the guilt!
