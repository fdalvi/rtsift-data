5 Zerorez did an awesome job making my carpet look fresh and new.  The tech Brandon was super friendly, explained the process, and seemed to really enjoy his job.  Had only good things to say about the company.  They were just a few bucks more expensive than the competition, but totally worth it and I'll recommend them to anybody!
5 This is the best carpet cleaning service/experience we've ever had. They don't use any weird chemicals or fragrants. The carpet doesn't get soaked too much so it doesn't take long to dry. And since there isn't any soap residue, it doesn't attract dirt and stays cleaner, longer. Dennis Strand is very friendly and thorough. Highly recommend.
5 We are very happy with the service we received from Zerorez. It's safe and my carpet is very clean - cleaner than using a rented carpet cleaner. The price point for their service is reasonable. It's worth it to me that my cats can walk on it and I don't have to worry about watching them when it dries licking their paws and getting a mouthful of chemicals.
