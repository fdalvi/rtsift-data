5 FANTASTIC SERVICE, on time, most reasonable pricing from before, my garage is very quiet and works wonderful... Had an emergency and he came out very quick to fix it.... Very happy!
5 I've bought door and I must say it's the best price I got for an insulated door. Honest straight to the point no bull and treated me better then family. Very trust worthy I have recommended them to friends
5 This was my 1st experience with City Garage Doors, although I did business with the owner's former business partner (and ultimately, the company that merged with City).  I was beyond impressed....from the quick answering of the phone to the work that was done and the reasonable prices charged.  I hope to not need anymore garage door repairs, but if I do, City Garage Door will be the ONLY company I call.  I called this morning and explained my issue.  They had a service man out this afternoon (due to my work schedule...it seemed like they could've someone out even sooner but I wasn't going to be home.). No extra charge for same day service.  The man I spoke to on the phone was helpful and was very happy to see that my technician came with the part I needed.  No upselling or coming up with other more expensive repairs and issues.  The technician was very friendly.  He was concerned I might also have a problem with the opener motor...he did a few quick checks and then said "nope...I'll think it'll be ok".  I appreciate and value the effort and HONESTY!!  Their fees/charges are VERY reasonable....$65 labor charge (and my part was only $30).  I did inquire about cost of getting new garage door opener, he said the total package...motor, clickers, install, etc would be less than $300!  Sounds VERY reasonable to me.  I highly recommend this company to anyone in need of garage door services.
