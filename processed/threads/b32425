5 I had a great experience at Chambers Clinic with their Acupuncture last month.  I really didn't think that it would do anything for me, but it really worked!  Amazing to feel the stress just pour out of my body.  A feeling of calm and peace replaced the stress.  Chambers Clinic is the place to go.
5 The practitioners at this clinic are phenomenal.  They spend quality time with their patients, truly try to understand the entire physical situation and follow methodologies resulting in natural solutions rather than the traditional medications.  The entire staff has the same mindset and will put anyone at ease on their first visit.
5 I made an appt with Dr. Alejandro after being recommended by a friend. I have several auto immune disorders, and in general, feel like crap all the time. Every other Dr I've seen has given me 15 mins to describe my symptoms and decide which pill I wanted to try next. Dr. Alejandro spent almost THREE HOURS with me. We talked about everything, my full medical history, my stress, my diet, etc. We discussed treatment plans and supplements I need to detox my body and help support my immune system so my body can do what it was designed to do: heal and take care of itself.  She was so nice, and very knowledgeable. I just started the program, and am already noticing some benefits. I know I have a long journey ahead - my body needs time to heal and grow stronger, so I will update my review in a couple of months.
