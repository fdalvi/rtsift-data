4 You know what you're going to get at F&B's The service is always great the food is pretty good if not amazing but the value is amazing to be honest. What more can I add to what you probably already know. Great for big groups or a quick lunch.  The Straiton F&B's is where my wife often go after I'm pulled round all the shops. The lunhtime menu is great value. A wee tip. if you go for the fish and chips but don't want salad...just tell the waiter/waitress and they will give you an extra fillet instead. Now, that's brilliant!
