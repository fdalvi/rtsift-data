4 I love going to this place because it's cheap good food.  Were talking fast food here, so don't think that 4 stars means this is gourmet dining...it's clearly not.  But, for the money and the amount of food, you can't go wrong.  I love the double beef double cheese tacos, and the macho nachos are awesome.  Way more cheese on the tacos here than Taco Bell.  Overall pretty good food, nothing special about the service because it's fast food what do you expect.
5 You know, I don't think I will usually review fast food franchises but this Del Taco gets an exception in a good way. No matter what time I pop in, nor what time of line there is in front of me, I can get my food in less than 5 minutes it seems, always hot and they always ask if I want hot sauce.   It's sad to say but it's a level of service rarely seen from fast food chains.  So, I give it 5 stars as this particular Del Taco seems well run, and has been for all the years I have lived up the street from it. Great job and keep up the good work.
4 Since its in my neighborhood, I am fast food hopping lol
5 Love DT and this location is one of the greatest. Not just clean but really friendly people.
1 Everything I've tried here was gross. The regular tacos are just normal. The fish taco was disgusting I thought I was gonna throw up. Gave it to my mom and she hated it. I'm glad there's other places around because I'm never going here again.
4 Del will feed you for dirt cheap and it's much cleaner than eating taco bell, doesn't make you feel sick and regretful hours later haha. We like to hit this up when we need something quick and cheap.
