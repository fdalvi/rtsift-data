5 Great place! Very friendly staff. And they make the subs look like what you see on tv, not all thrown together. Very clean establishment also.
4 Staff is friendly. Food is of course Subway. The only thing is its always busy. Expect to stand in line for a good long time. People just can't seem to make up their minds while they stare at all the veggies. Lol
1 Ew, just ew. Worst Subway I've ever been too, nothing but fat people and this place was so dirty and the food was gross and stale, avoid at all costs.
