4 I love this place!!!  I am a huge fan of Take-n-Bake pizza. There is nothing better than pulling a piping hot pizza out of your own oven and having fresher than any other way other than sitting at the pizza parlor.   We are a big fan of the Chicken Garlic.  I also love the stuffed meat pizza.  They also have bread sticks that you cook at home. Pre-made salads and cooking dough ready.   They key to success for Take-N-Bake, save the number in your phone. Call ahead and place your order. That way it is ready when you show up. In and out the door in 5 minutes.   There is another similar take-n-bake around my home, but the value of this place makes it well worth the 5 miles out of the way into AJ worth it..  Find a place near your home and give it a try.  You will love it..
5 usually get take and bake from walmart..never again this place is great ..Sauce was sweet and zesty, toppings were overwhelming. I couldn't ask for a better pizza today was my first visit and i will be back for sure
2 I like Papa Murphy's product so I've no complaint there.  My complaint come from their coupons.  I ordered 2 thin delite pizzas and had two coupons for 6.99 ea.for ANY thin delite pizza.   When I went to pay for the pizza, I was told a person could only use one coupon. There's nothing on their ads or coupon that says this, so I was not happy.  Also, I was charged a dollar more for my 3 topping pizza.  Only 2 toppings are allowed for 6.99.  This also was not on the coupon.  The coupon was for ANY thin delite pizza.  If it hds stated any' two topping pizza' I would have known.  So I am upset at them not honoring their own coupons.  If they have restrictions, they should state them in advance.
5 Great establishment with quality service that is timely and all for an economical price. I loved this PMs!
