5 If you haven't already, attend a bible study or a worship service here. The truth straight out of the Bible will answer your questions. Great group of people and are always up to something fun and exciting! :)
5 Truly the nicest, friendliest and most welcoming locale I've ever been a part of.
5 If you're on a journey to find the truth coming straight from the bible. I assure you that if you try this church, your journey will end and a new one will begin.  I know this isn't the ideal location for a church. This location is temporary as we search for a permanent one. What matters most is the words of God. And that's exactly what you will receive when you come here.   Our church in it's entirety was established on July 27, 1914. It was a prophecy fulfilled. What I mean to say is that our church isn't merely in this location, it has spread throughout the world. Including Summerlin, Las Vegas and Henderson.  So if you are interested, give us a visit and we'll be glad to welcome you.
