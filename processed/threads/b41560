5 Chris is at the top of his profession as a real estate agent.  He was the buyer's agent on my recent home purchase and was so effective that I asked him to list my present home.  We had two offers in the first 24 hours of listing.  Knowledgeable, friendly, responsive and easy to work with.  I would highly recommend him!
5 Chris Morrison is the best in the business.  His specialty knowledge of the Arcadia and Central Phoenix neighborhoods is unsurpassed.  He is knowledgeable, professional and dedicated-not just to selling real estate, but to helping people achieve their goals and dreams.
5 Chris Morrison impressed me by his knowledge of the market. As a coach, he has helped me develop my business in the most innovative way. I  highly recommend him for any of your real estate needs.
5 Chis Morrison and his team are amazing. As a first time homebuyer, Chris's highly impressive local knowledge and willingness to explain the process made buying my first home a great experience. Chris and his team were extremely professional, knowledgeable, and personable. I would HIGHLY recommend Morrison Residential to anyone looking to buy a home in Arizona Market.
5 I was recently a first time home buyer.  A friend of mine recommended that I get in touch with Chris Morrison, who had helped her buy her first house and she was happy to share her great experience with me.  When I met Chris, I was greeted with a warm and honest smile.  I immediately felt comfortable and that I was in good hands.  He showed me a couple of homes and I became well aware that he knew a great deal of the ins and outs of the business.  Within days he found me a house that I loved and I couldn't be any happier with the area and my first home!  I will be referring everyone to him from here on out.
5 I recently had need to secure a panelist for our school's Kids at Hope Career and Education event. When I thought of a professional who could not only address success but also relate to students about what hard work it takes to achieve your dreams in the real estate market, Chris was one of the first names I thought of. He not only quickly agreed to drive 20 miles to serve on the panel, but he further volunteered to rotate through several classrooms so students could ask more questions of him.  Chris is an exceptional professional, but also he is a kind, compassionate, and caring person, one who appreciates the value of hard work. Chris will work to gain your respect, and in return you will have nothing but a consummate professional.  I highly recommend your working with Chris and his team to sell or purchase your next home. You will not be disappointed.
