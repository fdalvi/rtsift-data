5 This little store is located within the Arizona Center here downtown.  I have shopped here before, as it is in the area that I work at.  It is locally owned by a couple, and they actually have two locations...this one and another location in Gainey Ranch in Scottsdale.  This place carries mostly touristy stuff.  I think thier prices are a little high, but the store is well kept, the people that work here are wonderfully nice and kind, and you can get a garden variety of items to choose from.
1 This place attached me with the beautiful copper fountain they have in the front window... It was all down hill from there though.  The store basically only had tourist junk in it and the employee working was incredibly rude.  SKIP IT!
4 I loved this place.  It was a little pricey but all the stuff in it had some kind of paperwork.  The paperwork explained about the materials used. I thought the lady who worked there was nice.  Don't skip go in---even if you don't buy you can soak up a little astmosphere,
5 I shopped in the downtown store last July and found that the lady that worked there had a lot of hisotical knowlege to share.  I loved the shop and the fact that I learned a little about the area.  She didn't have the item in the color I wanted so she directed me to the Gainey Ranch location and they had it.  That is also a lovely shop and the owners were there.  They were also happy to share some history with us which was great.  Both shops are a great place to visit when visiting the Scottsdale/Phoenix area.
