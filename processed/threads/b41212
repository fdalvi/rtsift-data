5 Great service... Very attentive. My wife and I interviewed numerous DJs before we met and immediately hired DJ Shai for our wedding. You can trust him to incorporate the musical and themes you want as well as keep the party going.
5 Dj shai was an amazing dj at my Wedding.  I was nervous having a dj for such a small wedding (30ish people) inside dal toro restaurant Inside the palazzo. But I'm so glad I did! He kept the night going PERFECT!   He met with us before to make sure to cater the service around our preferences! He seemed very passionate and super knowledgable about how the night should go when I was clueless! .  Dj shai was AMAZING without him my wedding would not have been half as good as it was.
5 DJ Shai was a wonderful addition to our party. He was professional, efficient and could read the mood of the crowd well. We had a great time with him and I definitely would recommend if you are looking for someone with class and can get it done.
5 DJ Shai is a true gem. He is the unique combination of an artist and a professional businessman. The majority of our guests were either 13 or 70, yet Shai found the blend of music and games to keep everyone entertained through the night. When we hit some glitches in planning due to religious restrictions, Shai took charge and got the party started. My daughter's event is now known as "one of the fun ones." Our event was a wonderful night to remember thanks to DJ Shai.
