5 We have been clients for many years.  Very happy Leslie and Steven opened a QC location- much closer for us.  They are always organized in their approach, often getting our annual taxes completed in advance of our scheduled pick up date.  We would not think of trusting anyone else to handle our financial information.
5 I used them to do my 2012 taxes and they were great. I was expecting to owe money but took care of everything for me and actually go me money back. The employees were all really nice and I would definitely recommend them.
5 I had a previous accountant do work for me for over a year but then found some problems with my financials and my taxes after the fact.  After having my business audited, realized I needed to seek the help of a CPA.  Steve Vogt, CPA was able to see me right away and take a look at what I had.  He was then able to redo my taxes for me very quickly as I needed them for some meetings I had coming up.  I would rate Steven Vogt and his staff with the highest ratings.  They made this experience pleasant but did their work very professionally.  Lorraine Lewis San Tan Valley, AZ
