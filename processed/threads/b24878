3 This is a fairly inconvenient convenience store. Not enough parking, long lines, often because they are understaffed during the morning and afternoon rush hours but also because the employees are too busy taking to each other to keep the lines moving. This has only gotten worse since they started accepting EBT a couple of months ago.  They've also been out of stock on staples like milk more than once.  This is not to say that it's all bad. Their coffee is good, the employees are friendly, and the place is clean. I like their car wash, and it's well-lit and busy enough that I'm not nervous about stopping for gas at night. But mostly it's the only convenience store in the neighborhood, so I'll keep coming back.
1 Horrible service every time I go here.  My last visit the blonde cashier told me long lines are normal here because they are the only gas station in the area. Sad. Huge lines, with only one cashier on register most times and the rest hiding in the back. Pizza by the slice is usually hours old and rock solid. Plus the shelves are fu of empty holes.  They should visit my new gas station on dysart just south of I10 because they truly know customer service.
