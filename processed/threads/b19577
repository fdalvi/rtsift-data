5 This is a fantastic running store.  I went in yesterday and spent an hour talking with Todd who helped me find the perfect pair of running shoes.  I have gone into a number of running stores around Madison and no one has spent as much time and effort to find out the troubles I was having and how to help me so that I can continue to run safely and successfully.  I would highly recommend this store.
5 Knowing full well we were going in simply intending to look, Curtis took the time to sit down with my girlfriend and I, measured both of our feet, looked at our stride, the movement of our feet/ankles/arches as we walked/ran and discussed what types of shoes we need to be looking for and why without ever ONCE trying to "sell" me anything.  Let me say that again.  After telling him we were just looking, he took a LOT of time to help us know what to look for and didn't once try to sell us on so much as a shoelace.   Their service to us "lookers" was outstanding and I can't recommend them highly enough.  As it so happens, we bought a pair of running shoes and the service had a LOT to do with that.  Because of Curtis and his service, we will be buying from them again...and again...and any other time we have a running related purchase to buy.    I would gladly pay more for this service, but I didn't.  The prices were spot on with everywhere else.    Thank you!  We'll be seeing you again.
