5 This place made me extremely happy.  Great looking shoes, mostly 3-4 inch heels which I love.  And the average price was $9.99!  It's a bit small but they pack the shoes in there - I found at least 5 pair I would have taken home and my boyfriend found an awesome retro pair - green and white - vintage vegas style rat pack golf course shoes.  Really fabulous and stylish and the girl helping me get a box of shoes down was darling.  Totally recommend this place.  And these shoes are fine quality, they don't look like they'd fall apart any more than any mall shoes would that are priced at $24.99 and above.  Pay $9.99 at Discount Shoe Factory and get yourself 3 pairs instead.
4 Wow I was in heaven. Prices start at $9.99. I bought myself two pairs of shoes and a pair for a friend for her birthday.   Totally recommending this place to all my friends.
2 I guess I expected better. The staff didn't interact with us at all and there selection wasn't that great at all.
