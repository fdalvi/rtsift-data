5 I love this facility, it's very beautiful. It's easy to forget your on a base.   Mass is held daily here, confession is every afternoon 1600-1630.
4 I have been to many Roman Catholic churches all over the world, and I find the most enthralling to be the humble institutions. No fanfare or dramatics, I have always been able to pray most deeply and be in the place of God at every mass here. Catholic mass is on Sundays at 9:45AM and Protestant mass is on Sunday at 8:45AM. I also believe they have services for other denominations, but you can check online for these times.
