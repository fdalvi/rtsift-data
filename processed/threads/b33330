5 Great spot for one of a kind items that are arty yet wearable. Hip yet practical.  And lots of stuff that was just plain fun. Thank you Jerry for the hands on service. And you exquisite taste and style.
4 This place is a cute little boutique store with pleasant owners!  They have clothes, jewelry and some nice spa gifts.  I bought one of their soaps because it matched my bathroom and was so cute and smelled awesome!  They have a good variety of clothing, some more traditional, some southwestern flare, others more hip, but all with a general artsy quality.  I LOVE their collection of Sunglasses, but I have like 50 pairs so I refrained from buying.  The prices are a bit steep, but the quality is outstanding and you can tell they use local/regional artists, which is always a plus in my book!
5 This place is  a gem!  The owners do an excellent job of finding artisanal items that are unique and of quality. There's a lot of one-of-a-kind pieces ranging from clothing, bags, belts, purses, jewelry as well as stuff for the home. If you are trying to find the perfect gift for someone (or yourself)  - A Cool Breeze is an excellent resource, especially if your someone/s is hard to buy for! I give it 10 stars... I'm glad that there are still stores like this around! When we are in Scottsdale this place is a must!
