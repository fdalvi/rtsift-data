5 This company was recommended to me by a a friend and I've been using their service for may years now and never had bug problems, they are very reliable and knowledgeable about bugs in the area and how to control them. The staff is friendly and professional, they stop once a month to spray and to make sure no insect moves into my house, is always better to prevent than to deal with an infestation.   If you have problems with uninvited guests, this are the guys to call, and no, I didn't mean mother in laws!
5 Sudden Impact is keeping our lives in control. Have gotten rid of all the nasty bugs. Were recomended by a friend who we trust. Good company!
5 I have been using Sudden Impact Pest Control since 1986 and I would not consider using any other pest control company.  They are fast, efficient, reliable and very considerate of your needs. If you want the best in town, call Sudden Impact!
