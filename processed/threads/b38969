5 This place is so amazing. I can't believe we waited so long to eat here. This part of henderson was missing a place like this and it is finally here. Everything in the menu is delicious and you will find yourself looking at other peoples food to figure out what you will order next time.   Our server Jaclyn was so helpful and always around.
5 Found this place on Yelp. We ordered from the Hawaiian specialties. Just what we were looking for. All with great service and reasonable prices. Will be back for sure.
