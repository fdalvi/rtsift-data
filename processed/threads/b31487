5 There's so many things to like about this tattoo shop. Everyone here is really friendly, you can tell they are a good team... they are a little tattoo family. This place is clean, well lit, and everyone has their own space. I had a rather large piece done on my rib cage by Ben of a peacock feather design and it came out beautiful. Nice steady hand, talented and a great personality. I couldn't ask for anything more in a tattoo artist. If I'm ever in the mood for another this is the place ill be going.
