1 So i experienced this place twice  the first was great, Why?  because this lady with a black eye was the bar tender  this lady fell down by the restroom (she was completely messed up)  and stayed on the floor claiming that the floor was wet   The second time was funny, Why?  because attached to this bar is a pizza spot where they cut a hole in the wall so people at the bar can order food at the place next door with out having to go outside ...anyway one of the cooks from that establishment next door was at the bar drinking while working...he was a young kid.  Anyway it was funny because he would run from the bar to his work to make food then run back for drinks and i couldn't stop from laughing at the amount of times he did this   So if you like GETTO, this is the place for you..
4 Went for the first time for happy hour and I would classify this as a great dive bar. It is dark with pool tables, televisions, and many regulars. The drinks are cheap and strong just like I like my men. I would recommend this place to any seasoned diver bar enthusiast.  The Pizza place attached was not half bad for a late drunk meal and the fastest way to get food.  See Wendy the bartender she is great.    Overall if dive bars are not your thing don't go.
4 My dad actually introduced me to this place a few months ago. I like to sing karaoke and drink and this place provides both on the weekends for a pretty nice price and they are always strong let me tell you lol  There is always the occasional wasted guy to hit on a pretty girl but the bartender and karaoke host are usually pretty good at keeping them away if you let them know. I'm not a big dive bar fan, but I do enjoy this place when I go out. Would definitely recommend :)
