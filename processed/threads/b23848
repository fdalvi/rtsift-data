1 When I started my policy a little over one year ago, this office would bend over backwards to help me in any way possible. Now that I'm a policyholder, I can't get them to call me back in the same week.  I've been really lucky to have only had to call for quotes during the past year, because I can only imagine how long it would take me to file a claim from start to finish. Save yourself some frustration and go through a different agent, this one is worthless.
