5 Great experience with Olmstead towing! They had a great response time, I was in a bind and needed someone there fast an they delivered.   Never had an issue with customer service, dispatcher told me what time someone would be there and the driver actually beat that time and got there sooner. Friendly driver, professional and no issues.
5 Good people and great service. I was going to be late for work when my car broke down on 95 north right by Craig road. They got a driver there in less than 30 minutes and I was able to get a ride to work and be there on time. They took my car to a shop by my house and only charged me $65. I'm so grateful for their help. They made a stressful situation much easier on me.
5 Thanks to Olmsted towing I made it to work on time today with their  fast response time when I broke down in my Mercedes yesterday! I had them take it to my mechanic shop and they knew rite where it was and my car made it safe and sound! Very reasonably priced and the driver was a nice guy! Definitely recommend this place!

5 I have one word: outstanding! I would highly recommend Shaun and his company to anyone in need of a fast, efficient, professional and job well done. Flat rate, no hidden charges! Very personable! Rescued my "black pearl" after being broken into.:( he drove it straight to the mechanics and it arrived Undamaged and prompt. Again-fantastic!
5 We've used these guys for years! They've towed me wrecked out caliber , our flat tire impala and our suburban a few times. Great rates service is consistently great and they are always here to get us quick! We just miss the old guy who ran the biz.
