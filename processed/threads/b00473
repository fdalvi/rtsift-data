4 Most helpful and friendly pharmacy staff that I've ever encountered. The drive thru can be slow, and watch out for Boxcar Willie out in the parking lot.
2 The evening shift pharmacy manager is a jerk. They only had a partial quantity of my prescription available so he gave that to me and told me to come back when I was ready for the rest. I came back a week and a half later and he told me that I had to pay my extremely high co-pay again because I waited too long to come back. I told him that there was no time frame given or I would've come back for the rest already. He argued with me and said that he had informed me of that (LIAR!!!!!).   He refused to override the charge for a prescription that I'd already paid for. He told me if I had a problem I could call 1800-Walgreens. I did just that. I spoke with someone in customer service who said that someone would contact me within 48 hours. I received a call the next day saying that my prescription was ready and the fee was being waived. Jerk.
4 I go here to get my prescriptions filled and also to shop for cosmetics and stuff occasionally.  I've never had a problem with the pharmacy.  The drive thru line can take a while at times, so I try to go during the off-peak hours.  When I don't have to wait for other people in line I can drive up, get my prescription, and be done in less than 5 minutes.  and sometimes they have treats for my dog!
4 The staff is friendly and there are some good deals at times.   The pharmacy is a little confusing, the staff in there doesn't seem to communicate well. I switched to a different birth control and they kept giving me the old perscription too until I pointed it out.  Regular walgreens, has most everything you would want/need from a convenience store.
5 EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE HERE! I've used the pharmacy (drive through at night) and store during the day and both were excellent experiences. By accident I left an item behind in the store after a purchase and the employees, especially the manager and assistant managers, were all VERY helpful in keeping it safe for me until I was able to retrieve it.
