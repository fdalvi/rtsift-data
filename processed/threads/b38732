1 I went to this venue to enjoy an event, The White-Out all White Party....sad to say after 15-20 min of attendance I was forced to ask for my entrance fee back & exit the premises. There was not any AC On the upper level which was the only place you could really sit and have a drink. They had 2-3 oscillating fans trying to cool the room off but instead they blew hot air. I was really perspiring just standing still, imagine trying to have drinks and dance in there!!        I spoke with management as she informed me the air was in fact on... Well if that was the magnitude of their AC I will not be returning! The staff was courteous & professional until I asked the money taking people for my money back, they told me they would soon go get the manager, they were not making any effort to do so, so I went and got her myself, she then returned our monies. Totally disappointed in this establishment!!!!  One star for most of the staff being courteous.
5 I had the delighted opportunity to try this place out for the first time about a month ago for lunch. The hip Chicago style scenery was amusing. I was immediately greeted and seated the moment I walked through the door. Surprisingly the restaurant was not packed with a lunch crowd but it gave me an opportunity to really meet and talk with the owner. He brought a taste of Chicago to the valley. Music playing while dining along with some mighty tasty wings with fries is what I had to enjoy. I have to say I was impressed with the presentation when my food came out. Plus my food was finger licking good. I will be back not just to eat but I have heard that this place has Jazz. Something different to do along with Happy Hour from 4pm/7pm Thursday and Friday with live music.
5 If you are looking for a Great Environment to relax, dance and or party, SEAY'S has it all. We've been enjoying their Free Line dance lessons every Sunday and love their Karaoke Friday's. Besides the entertainment , the food is delicious and amazingly affordable. How many places can you go and get great size meal under $10.00..One of my favorite meals is the grilled cheese sandwich with fries for only $5.00!!! You must come out and experience it for yourself!!! The only thing I would say is Park Central Mall could be a maze so if your coming to location from central ave once you see Jimmy John's its in the parking lot behind it. the easiest way is to go north on 3rd ave & Thomas pull into mall and you will see a sign!!! Park and walk down breezeway!! This is a Diamond in the Rough!!!! Don't take my word for it!! Go and enjoy so you can write your own!!!!!!
