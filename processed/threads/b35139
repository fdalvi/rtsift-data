5 Had my hair cut and styled today!  She did a fantastic job and even said if not happy with cut she would recut at no cost to me so I would be happy with it!  I think that's awesome!
5 Had my hair cut and styled by Kendra on 12/31/13. She really took the time to listen to what I wanted when other stylists in town have not. I'm picky about my haircuts because I like to wear my hair very short, yet I still want it feminine looking. Kendra did a great job! She told me that because it was the first time she cut my hair she would redo it if I wasn't totally satisfied within a couple weeks. Kendra also suggested a couple products for my hair type. Friendly staff. Reasonable pricing too. Will go back.
