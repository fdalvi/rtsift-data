4 Good Pizza! Good Wings! Good Sandwiches! Good Service! Full Bar! Lot's of TVs! Need I say more? We will continue to vist 2-3 times a month.  My only complaint is; when it gets busy, service slows down considerably.
4 We are so happy that tailgaters can choose Surprise az,  Love the food, love the pizzas, and wings, but sometimes we feel like we're invisible. The daytime service is not fast enough.  We eat there several times a month.    If the servers could pay just a little more attention to those who want to get their checks and leave that would be great.  We will be back!
4 Finally!!! After almost 4 years, have found an excellent white pizza!! No big globs of ricotta, well blended and crust was just right. Nice and garlicky, the way it should be!!
2 The food was average to above average. We got the calzone and the baked sub. We also got the spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer; it probably would have tasted better if it had come out hot.  Service rivaled the worst I've ever had. We waited about 20 minutes for an appetizer only to have our food come out five minutes afterwards. Our waitress, Missy, checked on us twice. To get my water refilled I had to stop and ask Missy personally and she still neglected to refill my wife's drink, which was also completely empty. We would go back if I go back if we could get the food and avoid the wait staff.
5 Awesome food and great service.  New to the area and we have already found a place to take the family on Wednesday's.   My kids loved the karaoke AND ate all of their food!
3 The baked Italian sandwich was basically a hot pocket in quality except my crust was burnt. Decent but not worth the price. Great service though.
4 First visit was a pleasant surprise.   Food was well above average and the bar was great. Prices were very reasonable. Our servers were good and friendly.  Sets way back off Bell road and Reems  on Southwest corner but worth a look.
