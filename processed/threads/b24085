2 This store is great because it has a drive through.  So if you are in a hurry consider stopping by here for some subs.  One word of warning though.   Their whole wheat bread does not taste good at all to us.  Maybe it's us but we think it totally sucks.   The french bread is very good though.   Once in a while they have gone too light on the sauce too.  So if you like mayo or another sauce be sure to ask for it or you may have a pretty dry sandwich. Went back again and the meat was skimpy.  Way less meat on the sandwiches than what was once standard.  Like any good sub shop they go downhill after a few years and then start serving you sub par subs.
2 There are much better places to have a sub sandwich... Not very impressed..
1 I can confidently say that I've eaten my last sandwich from this location and probably ALL Milio's.    When I arrived at the drive thru there were only two cars ahead of me so I figured it should be pretty quick.  However, I was very, very wrong.  I ordered my sandwich and waited in line for the cars ahead of me to move out of line.  That wait ended up being 10 minutes.  I would have exited the line and gone somewhere else if it wasn't for the curb by the drive thru.  I ended up waiting about another 10 minutes to get my sandwich.  The sandwich was pretty standard.  My experience has been pretty similar in past visits.  This is by far the slowest sandwich place I have ever visited.  Suck it, Milio's.  I'm out!
1 Never really liked their subs. I also worked with a couple employees and they hated working here (this location). They also said most of the profit go to feed the owners' drug addiction. So... Yeah.
1 Really dry sandwiches. Slow service. Every Milio's I've been to has been 4x better than this. Just bad.
