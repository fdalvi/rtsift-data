5 This is my favorite place for authentic Mexican tacos in Phoenix. I love the pastor and carne asada here.  They have the cart out for pastor in the evenings, I try to make it on the weekends when I am in the area.
5 I concur with Michael J. Found this place about a year ago and we are addicted. THERE IS NO PLACE BETTER FOR "AL PASTOR"! NONE. We have tried a few other things on the menu, and have not been disappointed. But frankly, thats what we go there for: Tacos al pastor.  We have even moved out of the area and come up with every excuse in the book to come back. It is well worth the hike if you are not close. Authentic. Rich. Flavorful.
5 I love this place it's awesome ! Yes sometimes some of the tables might be dirty is because weekends are supper busy . But the food is great no place like it real Mexican food ...  The chilaquiles are the bomb and the tacos with barbacoa even better for lunch . The Asada is great also ... To me there is no place better in phoenix !!!!
