5 Professional service and they take the time to discuss your dental health in a very clear and understanding way.
5 They just do not come any better than this.  I'm not kidding here.  VERY professional staff that make you feel at ease - the Doctor is the best I have ever had and I am 51 years old.  I am very glad that I walked in the door "just to make an inquiry".   -Glen Littell, Surprise AZ
5 Kathy the hygienist is amazing, friendly, and goes above and beyond. The office staff are very accommodation and the 2 dentists are the best there is!!! I would recommend anyone to come here. You will get the best care possible! They are great with kids and adults!!!
5 This is our favorite dental office. We drive all the way from Gilbert to come there.  See Kathy for a cleaning...
5 Now that my work is completed I need to update my review but how do you update "sheer awesomeness"?  I have been very pleased with the work that was done by Dr. J and his great office staff.  So pleased, in fact, that my wife and son now are getting all of their dental needs addressed with this group of professionals.  My wife is terrified of dentists, but Dr. Jason put her at ease, addressed her needs and came up with a well thought out and affordable dental plan.  My son had his teeth cleaned by Kathy and came out with a great smile.  He also has a dental plan with this office.  Without reservation I can say that this is the best dental office I have found in many, many years.
5 I love this dental group!  They are professional and accommodating.  Dr. J and Dr. Mashni are both extremely knowledgeable and talented dentists.  They complete their work quickly and painlessly!  Kathy, the hygienist, is awesome.  They all take such good care of their patients.  The front office staff is professional and so helpful.  I can't imagine ever going to another dental group. Patient for life!!!
