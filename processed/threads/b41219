4 A fun place...reminded us of being back in Italy. Great big wine glasses and an excellent selection of Italian wines. It is kinda cool of having a "market and mozzaerella bar" ciao. grazie. But, they really need a Happy Hour!
2 A mozzarella bar where you can't get mozzarella (or bread or italian lunchmeat--until dinner.  Poor, confused service.
5 Forno Fabbri is a slice of Italian life. Their delectable pastries and cappuccinos remind me of the true Italian style breakfasts I used to have in Florence. Their lunch menu (available until 5pm) is affordable and extensive, featuring items such as soups, salads, pizza by the slice and sandwiches. Their paninis are to die for. My two favorites are the crudo baguette panino and the caprese foccacia panino. The kale romana salad is incredible. Their very authentic "pizza romana" is something not often seen stateside, but definitely worth checking out. If you're curious about the mozzarella bar, meat balls and cheese boards, be sure to go after 5pm to see that menu! The team of Italian servers know their stuff and make excellent wine pairing suggestions. It is also worth mentioning that they are unfortunately closed every Sunday, which is something unmistakably Italian as well.
5 Absolutely love this place! I would not have known about it except for the article in azcentral about Pomo Pizzeria being one of the 10 best pizzas in the Valley. Looking at the website this morning, I saw the site for Forno as well. They are the only place in town to find a cornetto con crema like I had on my recent trip to Italy! This place is a true slice of Italy, walking in I immediately felt like I was back in Rome or Florence. The pizza is awesome, the selection great and the cornetto was perfect! I highly recommend Forno and if you have not had one before, get yourself a cornetto con crema, they are delicious!
