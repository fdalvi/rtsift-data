3 Super-cheap soft serve, slushies, and various other treats. As the name implies, it's carnival food.   Small, but discarded seats from Tilt-A-Whirl-like rides outside for your seating pleasure. We just got our ice cream & chilly willys (ice cream + slush puppies) to go and ate it on the walk back to my friend's home a few blocks away.
1 My veggie hot dog was a bit of a joke -- most likely just microwaved. Fries were soggy, flavorless and stale. Onion rings were okay. My boyfriend's burger was okay. Afterwards, I just had a stomach ache. :(  Way overpriced for what we got!
5 Stopped in today and had a burger, gyro burger, fries and a soda  Yummy!  Also chatted with the owner who was very nice. Thanks you for a delicious lunch!
1 Wow. Owner got mad at my review, questioned why I didn't contact him directly at the time, and I responded completely civilly, thinking it was an interesting question. (Ultimately deciding that since we ordered take-out, we didn't feel like calling to complain, waiting another 30 minutes, etc, and definitely didn't want to try it again, so there's that) He replied:  "You are as pretentious as I suspected, sorry for contacting you bitch!!  I NEVER bought anything prepackaged, and if you really cared, you'd ask, I wouldn't have to jam it down your throat, sorry you have to be 'convinced' what good food is."  Umm...
