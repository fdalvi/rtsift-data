5 This is my first time shopping at a Charming Charlie and it took me by surprise by how many accessories they sold here! It's an accessory candy shop.  They had stands upon stands of necklaces of all kinds of styles, shapes, colors and sizes. They had multiple bracelet racks scattered throughout the store and rings of all kinds and sizes as well. They even had foldable travel jewelry organizers in all sorts of colors and a nice selection of stylish cube organizers. I also noticed fashion watches, hats, shoes, scarves, earrings, fashion cell phone cases, hair accessories and also clothing to match them all!  Prices vary from inexpensive to moderate. I noticed casual bracelets starting at $10 and fancier vintage looking ones for $14. They also have deals all throughout the store as well, for example mix and match arm candy bracelets 3 for $20.   This is a great one stop shop for any woman or girl that needs to put together an outfit and accessorize, all in one place. From casual to dressy and per event, this is a great place to get inspired!
5 Holy cow I love this place.   Everything is organized by color and is displayed so u don't have to dig through things. U can just stroll through the large boutique and see everything.   The prices were fantastic! I bought a super cute clutch for 18.00 and sun glasses for 9.00.   The store was super clean and the staff was friendly.  Overall fantastic experience.
4 Who could not like  place full of fun costume jewelry that is extremely well merchandised?   Everything is arranged by color/style and change regularly.  Jewelry, purses, sunglasses, flip-flops, belts, phone cases and some clothing (which i've never looked at)  Even though the store isn't huge it's easy to spend a couple hours there.  Personally, I work up an appetite with a visit there, crossing the street for another shop so usually saunter down to a restaurant and grab a bite to eat or maybe a cup of coffee.
