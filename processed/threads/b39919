1 Rotten place.  Smells of sewage and the manager runs around naked.  Fact.
3 Hibernian Football Club, are one of the two major footballing clubs of Edinburgh. The Hibees are based on Leith and have recently gained a solid reputation in nurturing young talent with the likes of Scott Brown, Derek Riordan and Gary O'Connor starting their careers at the club.   Over recent years under the stewardships of Tony Mowbary, John Collins, and now, John Hughes the club has established itself as a top six team in the Scottish Premier League, playing attractive attacking football (a rarity in the Scottish game!)   The most recent trophy the team won was in 2007, when they beat Kilmarnock five - one in the Scottish League Cup!   The club is one of the main institutions in the area, and generally the fans have a good reputation in the game.   The last time I saw Hibernian was when they beat Celtic at Parkhead when they came from behind and scored in the last minute to win two - one! This team is on the up, and locals and visitors to Edinburgh should pay a visit to Leith to see this team!
5 Hibs club. Well my usual haunt on the weekend to watch footy and connect with fellow Hibees. Apart from match days its usually quiet. Drink is cheap for members ( I'm a member )  Its now 14:56 on Sunday the 16th February. Usual motely crue in. A nice place to sit and relax. I like it as its 5 minutes from my home. They do many functions here. Most Saturdays they have a show on in the main hall. There are function suites you can hire free and just pay for the bar staff on the day/night. All in all a nice place to relax on the weekend!
