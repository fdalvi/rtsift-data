2 Almost moved here, signed a lease, gave the money and everything.  The day we were to move in [monday] we did a walk through of the apartment and as we did we saw roaches on the ceiling, walls, in the cabinets, tubs & dishwasher. The grossest thing ive ever seen. it was like the horror stories you hear on the news.   It was infested! They had already sprayed twice and they were still everywhere!  They told us they wouldnt have another apartment ready til wednesday night or thursday, that wasnt going to work. just as we were about to ask for our money back they said they found a solution..  They were moving us to a different property. The sister property called crystal cove. Thanks for fixing the problem!   Would have given them 1 star but they were super nice trying to get us another apartment.
5 In Vegas for an extended road trip for work.  Instead of staying in a hotel, my co-workers and I opted for a furnished apartment.  I'm not really sure what the other reviewer is talking about, because our experience here has been great so far.  The apartment was clean and freshly painted when we moved in, the grounds are well kept and very well maintained.  The office staff is friendly and helpful.  I really can't say enough good things about Sahara West, we came here on short notice and they bent over backwards to help us get in and settled.  Also, it's located in the middle of everything you'd ever need!  Great place in my opinion!
5 Lived here for more than a year now. Clean and well taken care of. Staff is friendly and attentive to your needs.
