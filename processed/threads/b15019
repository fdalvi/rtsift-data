5 I called Andrea Winkel with Space Solutions for a quote, along with a few other companies.  Andrea took into consideration all the things we wanted to do with the cabinets as well as the spaces and our families as she made the plans for both garage cabinets and some in our family room.  I was nervous for the installation, but the man they sent was top notch.  He spoke english (he was actually caucasian) he had us inspect the work several times during the day just to make sure we liked how it was looking, etc.  He was quick, even though it was the hot arizona summer.  Recently we over-loaded one of the shelves and it broke.  They sent a man out who repaired it free of charge since they had just recently been installed.  Andrea was amazing through all of this, always willing to answer any questions or make sure we were getting our money's worth from the investment.  I can't say enough nice things about them.  We love our cabinets!
5 Space Solutions has Great cabinets and Service. Thanks for all your help. We love our Laundry room Cabinets.:)
5 Ours was a very simple project, 2-4' x 8' garage cabinets.  We talked to a few companies, liked the quality for the price and so far we're very pleased.  The guys arrived in the schedule timeframe and completed the job quickly.  Cleaned up as if they were never there.  Of course time will be the true test, but so far so good.
1 Satisfactory for garage or laundry room (marginally). These are inexpensive particle board cabinets and they will not hold a heavy load. If you have a lot of tools and other equipment for your garage cabinetry, I would strongly suggest this provider be avoided. They have had three complaints to BBB (which is pro business IMHO), Just be aware that you are buying a product that is not high in quality.
