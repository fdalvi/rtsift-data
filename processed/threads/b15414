5 Probably the best pharmacy experience I've ever had.  No hassles, very helpful & so efficient & quick!   I didn't have my insurance card & I told them I would run out & get it. The person at the desk took my prescriptions, gave me their business card & told me that they would start a profile on me & suggested I called when I had my insurance info & they would immediately process my order. When I called they said they'd be ready in 10 minutes & I'm pretty sure they were done in less than that, because when I got there they were waiting on me, lol. Isn't that nice for a change?!   Just in case you do end up waiting, there do have some basic chairs in the pharmacy, but you can also walk to the cafe that's nearby in the same building. Or if you're feeling adventurous you can cross the street and mozy on into the Estrella Hospital gift shop :)
5 They truly are the best ! Staff is extremely friendly and always go the extra mile! Thank you for the exceptional service EVERYTIME!  Lucy ;-)
5 HANDS DOWN the Best pharmacy out there!  These people know their job, are friendly, courteous and professional in every way.    The parking situation is not so great as their building is attached to the hospital and shares the same parking lot but everything else makes up for that! Believe me!  Grab a drink next door at the caf√©, BS with the pharmacy staff or read your Kindle while you wait.    There is a nice patio with tables and chairs right outside the doors of the pharmacy, great for when it cools off.    I enjoy using this pharmacy because they don't "grief me" for filling my pain med scripts ON TIME like EVERY OTHER PHARMACY I've ever used.   Imagine it!   No inordinate wait and no evil power hungry pharmacists laughing at you as you writhe in pain... Ok, maybe it's not that bad but when you are in pain, it may certainly feel that way.   Just don't abuse your meds and you won't have any problems here.
