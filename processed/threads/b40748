4 In the new Downtown Container Park, just as you enter on the left, is this small coffee outlet.  It's a satellite of the Beat Coffeehouse on Fremont Street.  There is a limited menu and no seating.  It's a walk up window where you place your order and then take a seat somewhere nearby.  The staff last night was absolutely delightful!  Friendly, smiling, and helpful.  Instead of coffee, I got a large hot chocolate and I took it to the second floor of the Container Park and sipped it as I watched the praying mantis blow fire!  What a hoot!  The hot chocolate was very good and just the thing for a cold evening.  This is definite stop the next time I'm at the Container Park.
4 Hidden next to pork and beans, this window coffee was pretty good.  Ordered a mocha and it was fast and fresh. Customer service was polite and helpful. Quick and easy
