5 I was referred to Berning's from a friend of mine.  I took my fiancee's ring to them after I had an problem with the setting (I purchased it from another store).   Zack and Patricia gave me a few options, and told me that they would do everything they could to fix the problem, but explained that I might need to re-do the whole ring.  In the end, they were able to fix the setting, the ring never looked better and my future wife could not be happier.  If I could give them 6 stars I would.     Great local family run business.
5 There is no place that can provide the same level of customer service that you can get at Berning's.  The pieces in the store are of the highest quality and are unique.  They are not mass produced like the products you see in the malls.  Zach and Patricia bend over backwards to fix, repair, search, and find exactly what you're looking for whether it is a new engagement ring or an antique watch.
