4 Okay so when tourists come to Edinburgh they love to buy tartan in any shape or form which means there is an abundance of tourist shops in the city. I normally take visitors to this store purely because its less annoying than the rest of the tourist tat shops. You know the ones I mean, the shops that blast bagpipe music out into the street all day and have See You Jimmy hats hanging off the window. For some reason these shops really annoy the locals. Thankfully Romanes and Paterson is not like that.   Romanes and Paterson has been around since the 1860's, which is a good enough reason alone to support a historic business. The shop stocks cashmere, kilts, woolen goods, tartan gifts, shortbread, Edinburgh Castle Rock and whatever else it is tourists in Scotland like to buy. It really is ideal for tourists coming to Scotland who wish to purchase their souvenirs to take back home. Its much better than all those shops previously mention which just stock complete tat.   There is also a cafe in the store which does a good afternoon tea and is waiter service. The only waiter service cafe on Princes Street I'm told, I guess that is probably true in a world full of Costas and Starbucks.
4 This store is the go-to place for everything Scottish, or at least stereotypically Scottish! Conveniently situated on Prince's Street, it's the perfect place to get friends and relatives "completely authentic" souvenirs at the last minute, even though you've been living in Edinburgh for the last year. Ahem.  My friend bought her grandmother one of those fantastic post cards of sexy scottish men wearing nothing but kilts (and some even flashing some bum!). I've been far more decent, and managed to get some good deals on a cashmere sweater and some playing cards for my dad.   This store is quite classy for a souvenir store, and I certainly don't feel too much shame buying presents there.
