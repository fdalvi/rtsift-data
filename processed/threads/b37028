5 My kids love this school.  I am also thankful for all they have done!
5 My son loves going to school here, and I love taking him! Everyone is so nice and friendly. Staff and teachers are so awesome. Compared to other schools, their tuition is very very reasonable. I'm so glad I enrolled my son here.
5 What a great gem of the Las Vegas scholastic desert! left the county schools in frustration. Here I see my children treated with respect by the staff. Its obvious that theytruely care about child development. I have watched them constantly improve year over year. Debbie Kay is the most dedicated administrated I have known. They have real food served daily too which is nice. I can't recco!mend this school enough!!
