4 We stop in this QT every time we pass by, which varies from a few times a month to months in between.  It's on our way to play baseball some 60 miles from home.  The people here are friendlier than average, even moreso than most QTs.
5 This QT is best in my book!  Well ran, very friendly and extremely efficient staff.  I can truly appreciate the way that this store is ran.  Well done!
4 I only wish they sold 8-10lb bags of their crushed ice. Convenient spot for lottery tickets.
5 People here are way more intelligent then circle k damn.
