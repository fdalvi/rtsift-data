5 I received most excellent customerservice here - and Im not even a customer! From the time I walked in the door til the time I left, I was made to feel welcome. The girl, joanna, who helped me out, made it way easier on me as i was cashing a check made out tothis bank and there are all kinds of internal procedures for that. If i decide to get a bank account, itll probably be here. Kudos to wells fargo for stepping up their game!
5 This bank gets a total of five stars from me. They are professional and on point. I love this wells fargo in my book its the best location in vegas.
2 Long wait for a banker at 9:30 in the morning. There are almost no customers here. But no available bankers as well. There are no greeters to help incoming people as in other WF branches.
5 Been in this branch a couple of times now and the staff is always nice and very helpful
5 Very friendly staff. Little to no wait time. Helped me quickly get a replacement bank card when mine came up missing. Very easy to work with.
