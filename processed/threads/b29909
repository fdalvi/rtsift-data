1 never been here and they have no reason to contact me as I don't even live in Az but these idiots keep trying to fax me on a cell phone it's annoying.623 587 7318 & 623 815 1222 are the fax numbers they use.muppets.
1 623 587 9618 & 623 587 7318 are the 2 today.haven't had a call in weeks and they've strated again.called them to be told the fax keeps on until it prints.I asked why are  you even contacting me as I live in Cali and have never been to your place,you have no reason to fax me.they just say sorry.what a bunch of f*ckin idiots.
2 just got a call from a supervisor really apologetic about the situation.she contacted me after reading my Yelp reviews.at least someone pays attention to them.so far so good,no more calls. thank you.
5 Love this pharmacy! Knowledgeable phone and pharmacy staff, delivery at all hours of the day and night, and darn nearly everyone is so incredibly helpful! I will be disappointed when I move and can't use this service anymore.
1 I have been receiving phone calls from them trying to reach a fax line for about six months and have repetedly asked them to take my number off their database since I don't do bussines with them yet I still keep getting phone calls; all of which come through 10 phone calls at a time, some of them after 10:00 at night.
