4 K's BBQ is a fantastic little BBQ joint in a stip mall across the street from the South Point casino.  It's named after the daughter of the husband and wife team who run the operations day-to-day.  They use hickory and oak to smoke beef, pork, pork ribs, ham, chicken, and sausage.  Seriously, this is some of the best BBQ I've had.  The sauce (albeit very tasty) isn't needed.  The smoke flavor is deep and true, the meat tender, but not falling apart.  You really feel like you're chowing down on some serious meat here.  The sides are typical BBQ sides: potato salad, macaroni salad, baked beans and coleslaw.  We especially enjoyed the macaroni salad, but there's nothing remarkable about it.  The brisket and the chicken we our favorites, but everything we had was very tasty.  Plenty of tables to sit and enjoy there, or do what we did and get your grub to go so you can get sauce up to your elbows if you want.  This will be my new favorite place to take friends for a fantastic BBQ fix!
2 Huge portions continue here after new ownership took over but I liked the flavor and quality of the food better before.  The food is nothing memorable. The meat was a little dry and very fatty. (shrug)  I used to recommend the place with the old ownership, but I can't say the same anymore. If you're *dying* for BBQ and happen to be in the area, it's okay.  But it's not a place to drive cross town for.
2 Its been a while since  I was here. But nothing about it made me want to come back. No major complaints just a lot of the guys do it better!
