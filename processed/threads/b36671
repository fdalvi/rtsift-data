5 This place is so stinking cute! Very clean and organized! My kid is too young still for the open play but we plan to attend the next Baby Signing Time class!
5 I love this place.  It's fun, comfortable, and CUTE in the hippest way. I threw my sons 4th birthday party here.  It was amazing!!!! The owners  did such a great job to make it easy and special for us.  Holly is super  creative and flexible to work with.
5 Awesome place for kids!
