5 Service is excellent, showroom is beaitiful, and the changing rooms are just so freaking cute. Ladies are very helpful, and offer a lot of praise for you in every item you wear, but not a lot of constructive critisism. I'll leave that to my mom. She's a professional critique! :P
1 BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES at a reasonable price especially because of the quality. I'm a little late on my review because I get so busy but I don't think I can shop at this particular location anymore because of ONE person! Terry! She was obnoxious and pushy and she was so loud! On top of that! She told me her whole life story after I tried on ONE outfit. Like seriously?? I loved the clothes and walked out happy with my PURCHASE but I will take my business back to the Scottsdale location or maybe even the San Tan location (sometimes I visit my Mother) and get great service as well as great clothes!
3 Interesting store, cute clothes, definitely not my type of store since it only sells women's products.
5 This is my favorite store hands down. I love their clothes and they have fair prices for the quality. If you join their loyalty program you get tons of coupons and discounts.  Every time I have been here the service is impeccable. The staff is never pushy and always ask my name (and call me by my name after that) and I love how they pick out items you might like. Its like having a personal shopper at no additional cost.  A+
