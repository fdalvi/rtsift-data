4 We enjoyed our stay here. We arrived late at night and had our baby with us. We had called earlier requesting a pack and play for our room and it was all nicely setup when we got there (linens included).   People were a bit loud at night, or maybe the walls are a bit thin? We think it was a bit of both. Mostly you could hear the people talking on the hallways but not from the room next door. Beds we're comfy and a/c was a bit loud but did their job! We liked the a/c noise actually because it "cushioned" the noise from outside for a while.   Breakfast was really nice and staff was constantly refilling eggs, beverages and other warm food. The coffee was not good at all but I think they rotate them anyway, and it's all about taste. Other people seem to like it! There is also a Starbucks across the parking lot- convenient location!  Plenty of parking and not a lot of traffic. We would definitely come back!
5 Loved staying at The Hampton Inn & Suites! At first I was like.... I wanted to stay closer to the strip. But, now this is the place for us. Clean suites, full free breakfast and is even dog friend
5 Great hotel. Front desk was very friendly. It was a nice quiet place to stay. Great beds, bedding, pillows. I tried to book more nights, but they were full for the next couple of days. It is a little far from the strip, but that doesn't have to be a bad thing!
