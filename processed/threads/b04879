5 Being an avid gamecuber (watch out Zelda) I was desperate to find the perfect game chair. Enter Love Sac. This is no ordinary bean bag, this is THE bean bag. I can sit in this thing all day and never leave. They are a bit pricey, and if you think you are too old for a bean bag, you are mistaken. They offer up to six seater bean bags in all sorts of shades, and you will not be disappointed. Gamers, this is your chair. I have found it. Stop looking.
4 For years, I've come into the store and have wanted a bean bag "chair"- my husband swears that in the next house, he is getting one for his "man cave." I can see our cocker spaniel jumping on it too (he is allowed on the bed in the winter time only, our bigger dog (lab/pit bull) is not allowed at all). It used to be just a few styles (mini, regular, lovesac) but it's branched out and now, the brand has a full line of products/furniture (sactionals/sofas/chaise/chairs/ottoman/accessories).   It's so much fun to just visit and chilax for a while (let it all sink in). I know other people enjoy it, because there are others doing the exact same thing! It's just fun, and it's ok for adults to have fun too. The setup is like a living room situation- realistic, and contemporary, complete with rugs. They come in so many different colors and fabrics- the possibilities are endless (cliche, I know, but it's true).  Hope it lasts, because it seems to have reopened here last year- ish (used to be in another location in the mall, upper level near the food court).
2 It's a very cool bean bag, but I couldn't stop laughing when I heard the prices. I can't believe how expensive these things have gotten... I think I till go over to Ashley and buy a sofa, coffee table, some lamps, an area rug and pay my cable bill instead.
5 Been looking for new rugs for my kitchen floor, and since I wanted something with a Little padding, it was hard finding something to fit my expectation. I did find it at Lvesac Galleria
