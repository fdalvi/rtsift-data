4 I love this place. Anywhere that offers a 2.5lb porterhouse is alright with me. Also, this is a sleeper pick for any top ten restaurant list in Las Vegas. The restaurant offers fine dining, asian fusion cuisine in a breathe-taking setting.
1 This was our first stop on our Vegas trip last weekend. We had reservations at 11 PM. Our plane landed at 10 PM, so we opted for a more expensive limo so we wouldn't have to wait in the cab line and possibly miss our reservation. We arrived at China Grill right on time, only to find out they had closed the kitchen at 10:30. The hostess got the manager, who then told us our reservation had been cancelled. She couldn't tell us who cancelled, why no one had notified us, or why they would close the kitchen half an hour before their last reservation. The manager was unapologetic, made no effort to make up for their mistake other than to get us a table at Red Square. Bottom line... some of the most egregious customer service I've ever experienced.
3 Disappointed with food during our must recent visit. On our car free diet, we ordered two salads- Caesar and calamari. Caesar had a simply horrible dressing, very mayonaisey. Calamari was too lightly dressed, had to order more to make it tasty. Still, both were underwhelming. Too bad as this has been a long time face.
