4 I went thru the drive thru during the afternoon lunch rush and they were super fast, I only waited for 2 mins :)
4 They have really fast service and the food is always warm always friendly  I like the fact the manger personally takes the food to you and treats you awesome .  He also gave me a whole bunch of coupons
2 ok so I understand you get what you pay for and fast food isn't 5 star dining but....   this visit to taco bell was horrible I ordered the box meal and my two tacos had a barely any meat in them I wasn't going to pay for a cheese and lettuce taco so I asked for more meat and she said she had to charge me so I asked for a refund   on top of that we were in the drive thru a total of 15-20 mins worst taco bell experience ever
