2 After spending thousands of dollars and years in violin teachers we finally came to the understanding that not all teachers are created equal and that you better do you homework before investing your time, your money, time and effort into lessons ANYWHERE. I you want your child to become an accomplished musician look elsewhere. I wish we had known :( Ms. Berns is very nice.
5 I really cannot write enough good things about this studio and its teachers. My son has been playing violin since he was 3, he is now 8 and starting his second year with the las vegas youth orchestra. He has learned an extraordinary amount from Ms. Berns and other teachers there who have really guided his ability. He has fun and really loves to read and play and compose music.  My daughter has been  taking piano lesson for a year now and I appreciate the humor and patience of her teacher. He has gone the extra mile to find material to really teach her all about piano.
4 This place is a great place to help your kids get started on just about instrument. I would recommend this studio for any budding music learners!
