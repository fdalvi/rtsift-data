5 When I first got my dog Kogi (My many default pics btw =D) I wasn't sure where to take him since he was my first puppy. So I did a google search and Glenn animal care was very close to me and Petsmart banfields hospital was some ridiculous prices.  Not saying I want to cheap out on health cuz I would go for the ends of the world for Kogi, but at the same time I rather go to a private practice that makes you feel more at home.   Dr. Umstead is very nice and its professional there, been going for 3 years now for both of my pups. They do cheap vaccine days too for the people on the budget twice a month.
5 We want the very best for our kids and this includes our furry child also. Eli is the best dog any family could own. When we adopted him at 6 months old he had been originally taken here by his previous owner so we decided to follow up with this office. SO GLAD WE DID! The prices are very competitive and the staff really care for your animals. I trusted them so much they were the ones to neuter him. Now that takes trust. Will continue to make the trip because of the great care my Eli has received.
4 Great Animal Care Hospital.  Dr. Umstead took care in spaying my little chihuahua named Roxy Marie.  She's very skilled in handling the operation procedures.  My li'l roxy is doing well after 1 day.   Her staff are well trained and good.  Most of all the clinic  is very clean and not smelly.  I will consider to bring all my pets for their care in this clinic from now on.
