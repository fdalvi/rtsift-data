3 The food is usually fresh but why at 10:30pm am I having to wait 30 mins in the drive thru??
2 Okay... Someone has to tell the management and maybe corporate that the drive-thru is ridiculous in both lack of speed and space for my vehicle. If you have a dually or after market rims, stay away!!   I've been to this location twice now and both times I've waited 25+ min with only about 3-4 cars ahead of me and both times were around 9pm.  And it's not like they don't have the man power to pump out food in a decent amount of time because when I went in to complain, I counted over 10 employees!   When this location opened 2 months ago, I was amazed at how busy they were and when passing by, it would seem like they are always busy.  But, no joke, I realized that the reason why they always look busy is because the drive-thru line doesn't move. I was unfortunate enough to end up in the actual lane, and was watching as cars lined up behind me and then speed off after 5 min of waiting without moving... lol...   They really need to correct this ASAP!!
5 This is cleanest fast food restaurant I have ever been in. The tables, floor and booths shine. As soon as a customer leaves, the table - booth is cleaned.  My burger was cooked to perfection. The lettuce, tomato and onion were fresh and cold. The fries perfect. Dave would be very proud of this restaurant.
