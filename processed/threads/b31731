5 Had a crack in my windshield and I called Bryan Ray.  He got me all set up.  They rolled out the next day, showed up when they said they would, changed the windshield, charged my insurance and did a great job.  Good job done by Guardian.
5 I called Bryan Ray yesterday evening after my van's side window shattered in a freak accident. The phone staff got me taken care of and the installer (Jeremy) had a new factory window in my van by lunch the following day.   Can't ask for better than that!  Great product. Great service!
