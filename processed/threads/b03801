5 I have been going to Troon Nails since 2003. They know what they are doing.I used to live much closer but I still drive 35 minutes to go there. They are the sweetest people you will ever meet. I never have any issues ever.My fingers and toes always look their best. :)
5 I get mani-pedis here regularly, the staff is super friendly, the place is clean, lots of great magazines to read, I highly recommend!!! :)
5 Best place yet for me and just around the corner!  Had a botched gel nail job and went here to get them fixed and filled.  fabulous job, was so happy.  make an appointment! they are busy and have only 3 people.  They are very friendly.  I think I have a bit of a hearing problem, so speaking clear english is a real bonus for me and all the staff are excellent in this regard.
5 I am new to the area and needed a fill SOOOO bad.  Trying to figure out who was good and who was bad, was a bit overwhelming...  I turned to Yelp for Help!  This place had all "5 Stars", for their reviews.  Albeit, some of them were very old reviews, so I was a little nervious.  I called for an appointment and was able to get in the next day.  The place is Very Clean, Friendly, has Reasonable Prices and their clients have been regulars for YEARS. Which says A LOT. I could not be happier!  My nails look and feel great. I have found my new Nail Salon in Paradise!  I will be going back for a pedicure soon.
