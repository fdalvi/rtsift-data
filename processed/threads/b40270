5 Interior wise this is more a Italian 'caf'. Not really a restaurant as such. That said I have to say that their food is very tasty and the portions are not too big. I don't mind the 'caf' look & feel as it is suited for my purposes. And do Italian places always have to be a restaurant?   I do treat my visits here more as a quick snack, for a nice chat over a good coffee or even just to gather my senses.  I like it. The staff is efficient and very helpful. The place is clean and the prices reasonable.  So it does exactly what you expect it to do - it serves Italian food that tastes good.
4 Must go again. It was like being in Italy.
4 A great stop off after the movies. Food & drink here represent good value for money.  Staff are friendly and efficient.  Lots of Italians eat here, which for me is a good sign.  Even if the place is packed there's a good chance you won't have to wait too long for a table.
