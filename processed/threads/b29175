3 Located in the northwest of Boca Park, this particular Chase, surprisingly, doesn't attract too much traffic.  One would think there would be plenty of people in line after business hours because of the other shops in Boca Park, but I have yet to experience that.  There isn't a whole lot of details about the customer service here because it sits right in the middle.  Not great, but not bad at the same time.  If you're in a bind for dough and want to avoid any "traffic", stop in here.
5 This Chase is awesome! It's in Boca Park and it's usually pretty empty and the staff are super attentive and helpful. Def check it out if you're in a rush and you want to get in and out!
4 vic, anna marie and kevin here are great helpful and friendly  i need change or deposit almost every day they are always on their game i would think this was a small town bank if not for the name --
