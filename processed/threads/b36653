5 This guy is fantastic. Can't recommend him high enough. Very reasonably priced, he will come to your house and repair your furniture. In my case I had purchased three relatively expensive bar stools from Ashley Furniture. They would not send technicians to repair so I was on my own. Cornelio fixed the chairs.
5 Very quick and efficient repair service. We sent him text with images of our problem furniture in need of upholstery repair. Came directly to our house and fixed it here.Great work.
5 Cornelio is awesome! Very fast and efficient pays attention to detail. I sent him photos via text of the bench I needed repaired. He came over to my home and fixed it for me which was super convenient. His prices are very reasonable as well.
5 We are blown away at the repair job he did for us!! Our puppy had chewed up the corner of our famlies very nice, antique oak bed and he fixed it no problem! I sent him a text of the damage a few days before he was scheduled to come out and the paint matched the color of the bed perfectly! He was quick and did an amazing job at an affordable price for us. We are new to Las Vegas and so happy we have found our forever repair man!!
