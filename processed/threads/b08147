3 Great location to live, easy freeway aceess. Close to all the new shopping and city re-developments.  Would give better rating except that they offer better amenities to seasonal residents then the permanent ones like us.  They get to use the billiards room, hot tub, rec room, etc.  We are not allowed to use any of that.  Just a pool and an exercise room. Sad!
2 Great location to live, close to everything. Low crime rate, neighbors for the most part are friendly and plenty of community activities. One complaint is they shut the water off almost every two weeks but luckily for me I work during the times they do-9am to 2pm. Quiet for the most part, every now and then will hear loud radios of passing cars or couples fighting in the street. Security is great. Another complaint is stray cats spraying your car, bike or stroller anything that is parked out side and smells horrible from them spraying when heat rolls in during summer! The security gates are always broken and non residents constantly come in to "dump" their trash in the large bins in the back and leave it looking like a dump. Non resident teens also sneak in and jump the pool fence because of the broken gates and without a life guard not safe.
1 Horrible. Dave at the front desk used the F-word on the phone when I called in. Very rude.
