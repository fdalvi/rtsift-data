3 Who knew that there was a middle eastern mecca  right down the street. I now know where to get my goat, bulgur, egyptian yogurt and oh so much more.  Owned by a cute little lady  who dreams of expanding and growing her  own  arabian kingdom  , she was fun to talk to  and find about her plans for her "corner". I loved checking out the grains and beans, I bet I could make an awesome bean soup with some of these treasures. I  am sure I will be back for red lentils. I   also was jazzed to find a 4lb bag of split peas for only 2.00  ...screaming deal.   Anybody know what to do with pressed apricot ? It was inexpensive and seemed "cool"  but not sure how to use it. They also had interesting spices , grains and ,taa daa  ,various filo doughs and puffed pastry ...something I have had to go out of my way to buy before.   I wished they had fresh produce but oh well.  I am very curious about  the new restaurant next door to be called Ali Baba's .   I am sure it will be an adventure too.
4 This review is about the grocery shop.  I have been here couple of times here for the goat meat. The owners are really a pleasure to talk to and make sure you really get good meat here. I told them about a certain tandoori masala which I uSed to get in one of the shops in CA and they were ready to get it from there ! Will go back for more.
5 The new management in place are great. The best Halal meat you can find in town.  The offering variate is growing by the time. The new management had been there for almost a year, and they improved the market quality a lot.   If you have an experience more than a year ago, you have to give this place another chance.   My cousin used to drive all the way from Tempe to their meat until he lift town. He told me the only thing that he miss in Phoenix area is their meat!  You can see the picture for the fresh meat and chicken
