2 It's Subway.... what do you want?
3 Its Subway. Thats about all their is to say about this place. I will say it is a very clean well run store and the owner takes pride in this location.
5 This is the best Subway in the state of Arizona. I would know; Ive been to every single one! This is my favorite so far! The staff was kind and inviting, and the area is beautiful! I go here at least three times a week now, you should too!
4 This location makes good Sandwiches.  I of course order my regular Sandwich which is a footlong BMT on Cheesy Italian Bread. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mLj1xf3Za6PAoEYsddOOOQ?select=1yN8r6CM5fMLgf_nI8OJ2w  The Sandwich Artists here pay attention to your order and it generally goes smooth.  Plenty of seating inside, which is always a bonus for me because I enjoy eating at the restaurant.  My experience at this place is always a good one.  Return Factor - 90%
3 Not the worst subway experience.  Not the best.
