4 Maisie's is a cute as a button children's clothing boutique stocking all the designer childrenswear you could ever need. Perfect if you're looking for a gift for a tot or someone who's just had a baby but not so useful on the practical front when the new cool cat outfit is bound to get mud or dinner down the front of it.   The shop is very well laid out, it's very warm and inviting and the staff are friendly too. I browsed for a good wee while with some friends and we "oohed" and "awed" over all the cute clothing and quirky accessories.
3 Maisies is quite a prominent down in South Queensferry apparently. I found this out after I visited this place and I have to agree, it probably deserves its reputation. It has a whole range of products on offer for children and for those who have just invited a wee one into the family.  As Eleanor says, this shop would be great for anyone looking for a gift for a young child. For them or for their parents! The shop is full of gifts and home ware/interior products for houses with kids. There is even a large selection of clothes for children. And these clothes quite a bit, yes, it comes as a shock but I have learnt that bringing up children is an expensive business!  Currently, the shop is celebrating the joyous return of Toy Story! Just check out the window display!
