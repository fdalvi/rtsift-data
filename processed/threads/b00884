4 Standard GNC store. Friendly staff. Fully stocked with everything you would expect from a nutrition store.  Join their Gold Card program and save $$. Save extra the first 5 days of each month.
2 So apparently not all GNC's are created equally. This place does not have the same prices as the GNC at Mesa River view. Pretty lame right? I thought so as well and why does GNC make their employees wear ties? Pretty lame considering those guys make about $8 per hour.
1 Although this retail location appears to be stocked with merchandise, the staff seems disinterested in helping. They would prefer to assist clientele who are on the thinner / fitter/ younger side of life. Anything else they really don't have the attention span for.  As witnessed on multiple visits.  [Head Shake]  Before I dropped a chunk of mass I ventured into this store. I would have spent the world and the moon that day. (The mgr of sales in training at my gym had sent me over to "invest" in protein what not.) I had a very specific product to purchase and a list of other "maybes".  Yeah, this is before I started eating clean. Anyway, I had some questions. But the same very tall, dark haired lad, had to help a gal. With her cell phone. And then with mints. And some other critical stuff.  I get it. Flirting. Sure, on the job. Go forth, do that.  But when I finally had his attention, he had the audacity to be annoyed. At the actual paying customer. (vs. the gal that works next door and pops in all the time.)  Hoy Vey. Kids. I get 'ya.  But help the old ones with their wallets wide open next time.  Periodically I would stop in there on my way to Sports Authority. To buy some energy bars. SAME THING.  Then I changed my food vocabulary and never, ever, needed to go in there.  DON'T GO.
