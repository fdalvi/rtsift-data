4 Wow...this spire is BEAUTIFUL! And the fact that it's a Frank Lloyd Wright piece, also known as the Taliesin West Promenade Spire, doesn't hurt.   It's a true piece of art in that it looks good no matter what time of day it is; daylight, dusk, evening. The spire shows beautifully at any time of day.
5 Pretty impressive to have a Frank Lloyd Wright art work just out for public view. It's huge, blue and lights up at night. You can't miss it nor should you miss it!  Oh and it's free!
4 I've passed by this spire, on foot and in cars, for years, but I only found the water fountain a few months ago while on a stroll. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/frank-lloyd-wright-spire-scottsdale?select=sKiua623YZpCKgcfsnCHmA#sKiua623YZpCKgcfsnCHmA  Why I never spotted it before, I don't know why, but I'm glad I found it.  Now, when I'm in the area, I try to make it a point to visit, for it is so pretty and tranquil here, even amidst parking lots and heavy traffic on Scottsdale Rd.
