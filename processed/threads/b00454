4 One of my new favorite thrift stores! I dropped a bunch of stuff off today and took a look around. They get some really nice stuff donated to them and there were a lot of name brand items like Kennith Cole, The Limited, etc...the shoe selection is pretty nice as well.  The store is smallish, clean, and has a friendly staff. The proceeds go to help women who are victims of domestic violence so it's putting your money to good use. They're hours are limited...something like 10-4 on weekdays and 10-? on Saturday, so plan accordingly.
5 Great place to donate your gently used items to help out those that need it.  Everyone is always so friendly and grateful.  Maybe one day I can give more than just items.
1 This review is solely about volunteering here. They do not return phone calls or emails. They treat people that want to volunteer their time horribly! On facebook former volunteers/vanguards are always complaining. Sojourner Center should start treating better those willing to work for free! This is a disgrace. The horror stories that i heard and my personal experience of not even treated as a person that should have emails returned is just unbelievable. Want to volunteer? Look elsewhere.
