4 Sonic used to have a lot more food items on their menu. These days they're focusing mainly on the drinks. Which is fine by me. Milk shakes, slushes, limeades, and more. A few burgers and snacks round out the menu. Service is always on the slower side here, but the car hops are always friendly and will even come back and check on you later. Plus they have a happy hour every day, with buy one get one drinks.   I've never been a fan of the burgers, but the toaster sandwich is really good, and the tater tots are among the best.
5 My husband went there on the way home from work to get milkshakes. The super sweet cashier applied some kind of discount/promotion/coupon to our order without us even asking; we were completely unaware of the promotion. Very sweet of her!
5 Come here often late night when Rudy is working. By far the best employee here or at any other establishment. Always very nice & gets my order quickly.
