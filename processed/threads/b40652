5 The sweet potato muffins are amazing and impossible to tell that it's got all good things in it and the sweet pie taste better than a pie loaded with sugar and is moist and filled with flavor! The creator ain't that bad of a dude either!
5 Omg my friend bought me chocolate sweet potato pumpkin muffins. They are awesome. The nutrition facts are amazing my next thing I want to try is the cinnamon apple cheesecake...   I love the muffins thank you
5 Who knew no oil sugar or butter could taste so yummy. No fake sweeteners. GG uses Stevia. I can't wait till these goodies make it to Cali.
5 This stuff is amazing!!! Protein packed, no oil. No butter or shortening! Best of all it tasted amazing. It's so nice to see a company take pride in their ingredients. Everyone must try this!!!!!
