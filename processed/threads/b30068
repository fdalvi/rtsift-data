5 The days of Casual Male XL shoppers ordering online and waiting for that special item to be delivered to your local store is OVER.

You won't run into that problem at all here....all the same great service....selection....and prices still exist as they did at your local Casual Male XL or Rochester Big and Tall stores.....only BETTER. Visit them at www.destinationxl.com and enjoy my friends!!!
5 Went in today to find some nice outfits for guys who enjoy good food. I worked with Danny he was great. I found some great upscale labels and some good basics. For the larger types they definitely have some nice brands. I am completely satisfied with my selections and would recommend this store for the meat and Potato crowd !
4 They do have my sizes; but damn are they expensive!  Only name brands can be expensive, but you get what you pay for.  I guess I'm just bitter that I had to go here for an extra 1/4 inch in the neck for a fitted shirt (guess that's what I get for being bigger than the average American).  Michael Kors white french cuff shirt is the most comfy I've ever worn.
5 I can't say enough good stuff about this store. They have great customer service and a huge selection of clothes for us bigger guys (no pun intended). The people that work here are very helpful and they keep the store very clean.  The bathrooms are clean as well, which was great since I had to take my daughter to the bathroom during my last visit.
