3 Obey the snake and go see the naughty Eves at Eden's stripper garden, Mr Adam.  Just a block or two up from the Rio and Palms, so this smaller strip club is one of the closest to the Strip.  The numbers are similar to the rest: $30 cover (out of state), $6 beers, $20 lap dances.   It's a nice size place, not as big as the warehouse that is Sapphires or as ultra lounge crowded as Spearmint Rhino.  The apples here are mostly Red Delicious, not so many Granny Smiths.  I've heard tales of a lot of Granny sightings, but I think it depends on what night you go.  Try to go on a Fri or Sat.
1 We passed by this club and thought "why not?" Luckily we didn't have to pay to get in or else I would've asked for my money back. We bought on of the groom's men a lap dance for $20 and tell me why the lady, yes I said lady, looked like a grandma? We all watched as he begged her not to take anything off.  Some of the male patrons seemed to be content although I had to wonder if they knew this was not the lone gentleman's club in vegas.  The drinks are cheap and strong so we took advantage of that. We were there for 20 mins. and off to the next club we went. That was by far the shortest time anyone of us spent at a gentlemen's club.
