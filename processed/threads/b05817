3 Good hair cut for a good price.
1 Customer service, hair cut, and attitude, all sucked!       Went in with my son for 2 haircuts. Had to wait 1hr for a 15min wait. I could understand if other people were in front of me. I was the only one waiting.      After 30min of waiting, one stylist finished her hair cut... chatted for awhile with the other stylist... then left to get lunch and make a deposit at the bank. She said sorry but she had to get there before they closed.       I stuck it out. After an hr the stylist that was still there (working on color or perm or something) bitched and complained about being stuck there with no competent help.  She acted like she was doing me a favor by cutting my hair.    I didn't get my son's haircut there after all that. When I got home my wife told me to go back and have them fix it.  No way!     My wife tried to help but made it worse. I went to the great clips on buffalo Vegas and they fixed it for me.    If you want to get butchered, don't mind wasting your day, and love hearing people bitch about their job.... give this place a shot.  Don't bring a gun because you'll probably kill yourself.
1 Incompetent. As I was walking towards the store, I saw two women at the front counter and they both had a hesitant look as if they didn't want us to walk in. I have an eagles eye and saw their expression-totally unprofessional. I usually leave high tips but I wouldn't want to spend a dime at this place.  Train your employee to have class and be approachable. My buddy got his haircut because he was in a dire need-I'll take my service and tips elsewhere.
4 I always get my haircut here, I love my stylist, her name is Precious. She is very sweet and friendly, and she know what she is doing. She is the reason I go to this salon.
