5 Great shop.  The staff and ownership was very knowledgeable and really helped me to narrow down my search.    I found the pricing to be more than competitive and they had a few items in stock that are nearly impossible to find in town (380 acp and 9mm.)  Definitely will work with the DM team again.
5 After a ridiculously horrible experience at another local Gun shop I decided to check out DMPF. I was warmly welcomed and the staff showed genuine interest in answering my questions and taking the time I needed to help make an informed decision with my next firearm. .       They are ALL about customer service first. Sales will ALWAYS follow that in any business.  It is worth the trip to visit their shop!!
