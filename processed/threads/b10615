5 Have a Chevy? Don't know what's wrong with it? Don't want to get ripped off? Come here. They have worked on my friend's truck and his 63 Nova. When no one else could tell him what was wrong and why the Nova was overheating... Chevy Shop knew right away what was wrong. And they were right! They fixed it and he's had no problems since.  Truck wouldn't start, we had it towed and they fixed it in just a couple of hours - even volunteering to work late to finish because they knew he needed his truck for work. Tremendous service!
5 They were amaze! Helped us out when we were in a jam and Blayne was a real cool guy. I can always appreciate someone who is telling me what's up and not just trying to get my cash!! Thanks Chevy shop you have a new "regular" from me!!
5 I can"t say enough how I appreciate how honest this shop is. I"m new to the Vegas area and had a older Suburban and really didn"t have an idea what was making a strange noise in the front end,. Most shops would have created a problem , you have this or that , not Blaine he checked over the vehicle and a little grease later, he called and told me to come pick up my vehicle and for a couple of bucks and keys in hand I was out the door. It"s a honor to meet and honest mechanic.
