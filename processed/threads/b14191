4 We got there at the right time.  We were able to get a breakfast sandwich with french fries.  Our timing will probably never be that great again, but we will try, lol.  Gotta love McDonald's fries!
4 I love this McDonalds mainly because of the drive thru staff, they are simply the best.  We stop here on the way to the Saguaro Ranch Dog Park for soft drinks all the time and the staff almost knows our order before we make it.
1 Dirty restaurant!  When I walked in I was struck by how dirty the restaurant was. The floors looked like they never get mopped plus litter on them. Behind the counter the stainless needed cleaning, especially where the sundae toppings were. Most tables had trash on them.  I complained to the manager, a young dark haired girl who said she would get to it. Yeah, right...  Most of the customers 1 saw that day were using the drive thru so they would be unaware of the dirty restaurant.  I will not be back. There are plenty of other McDonalds that at least appear clean.
