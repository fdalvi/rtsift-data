5 This parish has to be admired for its dynamism and its dreams, one of which is nearing fulfilment. The parish office is presently at N 7th Street but the church building of the Vietnamese Catholic community is nearing completion on the corner of Northern and 29th Avenues, although the wrap-up of construction has been delayed during this economic crunch. I look forward to the completion of the magnificent structure which will surely be one of the distinctive architectural landmarks of Phoenix.
5 Gettin' there! The church building is mostly complete, and application of the finishing touches is now in progress in the main worship area of the church. In the meantime, services have finally been moved from N. 7th Street to this new and permanent building on 2915 Northern Blvd.  Mass is held in the spacious basement area while the main worship area above is being completed. The grounds are beautiful, and even though the parking area gets crowded when there are services, there's plenty of space to park. The Mass is in Vietnamese, but any non-Vietnamese raised in the Roman Catholic tradition can follow its spirit, if not the exact words.
1 visiting AZ I wanted to get some spirituality going so I called to get some questions and because I am not Asian he stated dont call here again! NOT OK FOR A CHURCH TO SAY IDC ENGLISH OR NOT!  I will never come here or call
5 When my Asian friends ask for a place to worship in Phoenix, it can be hard; however, for those Vietnamese speaking Christians, I have discovered the specific place.  The building design and the faith being located in an area easy to find makes it obvious to our citizens with ties to Viet Nam.  The building can help point to the fact family and an ancestral link are able to be found at this location where A SPIRITUAL bridge is anchored.
5 Incredible church and architecture. Those who took photos during service inside are daring.
