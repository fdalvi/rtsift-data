4 Great service!!
4 took my nephew to get some Nike's that he wanted... I wish I could remember the name of the guy that helped us...he was super duper nice... anywho, they didn't have the shoe in store...so he tracked it down and ordered it for us with free shipping to my nephew's house. :) high five for great customer service guys! :)
1 How hard is it to be polite? If you don't like your job, why work here? Dude took his time ringing up the customer in front of us while there were 3 other customers in the back of us. We asked a question and got a loud  "what!!??!?!" in return. His arrogant face was threw me over the edge!
