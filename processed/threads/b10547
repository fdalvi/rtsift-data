4 This place gives you the tools to get a job if you're confused and/or clueless about the process.  They're useful because:  1. They will give you a professional recommendation if you set up an appointment and come on time and are dressed appropriately for the type of job you're applying for.  This is especially nice for government jobs with lots of red tape.  2. They will hook you up with info about the programs available to help people gain job skills to get a basic job.  3. Get there early - if you're not there by 10 the place fills up and it starts to make the DMV look like a model of efficiency  I actually did not get my new job here, but I did have to pick up some paperwork here for my sheriff's card and I found out a lot about some of the resources that would have been of great help to me during my recent period of unemployment.  For the most part the people who work here are thoughtful and on point, considering all they have to put up with.  Oh and just like the DMV, there are some people here who are absolutely horrible, on both sides of the counter, so just try to ignore those asshats.
2 This place has a bunch of already filled jobs they make you wait in line for 2-3 hours and give you up to 4 referrals for jobs that pay diddly or have all been filled. They do however let you use the computers,phones,fax and copier.
4 Great place to start...
