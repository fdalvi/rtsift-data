5 I found Mr. Freds Golf and ordered a unique looking putter, looked like Batman wings. Balance was wonderful and liked the overall feel of the putter. I ordered one and got it custom fitted and hand crafted in a few days. Very nice putter and enjoy it very much. I would buy again for sure! Great service and prices, Mr Fred really does care about his customers. His website is very informative. What will he do for an encore?
5 I purchased two trouble out hybrids from Mr. Fred's Golf. I love them!!!!!!!! Great customer service, fast shipping and unbelievable prices for quality clubs.
5 Mr. Freds rocks!!!!  i picked up a complete set of iorns, wedges, a driver and putter from Mr.Freds and i gotta say you cant beat them. he delivers a good product at a great price!!! having clubs that are custom fit to me help my game out a lot. and if you are local he has a re gripping service at the farmers market on green valley parkway every Friday.
