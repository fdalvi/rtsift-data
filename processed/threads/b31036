5 Just purchased a used BMW R1200C and was appalled at the dealership prices for regular maintenance services and began looking for a small private bike shop.  Was referred to Josiah, the owner of Dirtball, by a fellow BMW enthusiast.  Josiah is BMW certified + works on all other types of bikes.  He's fair, friendly, and VERY reasonably priced.  I needed a couple new tires and he ordered them in for me on my word and the price was the same as any super cheap, no overhead, online motorcyclesuperstore type etailer.  He charged a fraction of the cost for install and then even test drove the bike for his opinion on it mechanically, he found a loose tail light.  He also adjusted my shock to my height/weight.  He didn't charge me for the test drive, shock adjustment or the tail light tightening.  I spend some time in the shop watching him work on my bike and could tell he's very careful with all of his customer's babies.  He had several folks drop in and drop off big expensive bikes of all flavors, all so relieved to have found him.  Josiah is honest, knowledgeable and and affordable, I highly recommend him.
5 I also want to add my very positive feedback about my experience with Josiah and Dirtball Customs.  I took my 2007 GS to him for some minor servicing that I just couldn't get right (throttle body synch and the related valve adjustment) and he not only did those services for a very fair price but also looked over the bike very carefully.  Thanks again Josiah!  Your prices are fantastic for labor and I will see you next month when I replace the tires on my GS.
5 Highly recommended! They did superb work on my Honda VF1000R after a previous mechanic had dropped the ball on some some fairly simple repairs. Everything was explained and several insightful suggestions were made that ultimately turned out to be correct. Prices were excellent.
