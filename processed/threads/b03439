5 Ruth Sells made a long uncomfortable process so much easier than it could have been. Last August against Ruth's suggestion, she said it would take forever, we put a bid on a short sale. The following months were an exercise in frustration as the seller's bank fired processor after processor. They were on their fifth one by the time it was approved so it took almost 9 months. She kept after the seller's agent for information and updated me almost weekly, even when there was nothing new to report, just so I would know what was going on.  When we decided after 8 months that we wanted to look at other houses she sent us a list of houses in our specific wants needs price range. All through the process she has been fantastic and I can't recommend her enough.
5 A good friend referred me to Ed Adler.  Not having used a Realtor before I had no idea what to expect. From our first conversation I knew I was going to be working with someone who loved what he did. And immediately I felt I was a priority. He showed me how to use the MLS and when we began looking I knew he had done his homework for me. Ed, has a great sense of humor and is not shy about good feedback on a property that we looked at. He takes everything into consideration. Not just the condo itself, but takes the time to get to know his client so that if the neighborhood is not right he will speak up and not waste my time or his if he feels it is not the right fit. I had fun looking for my condo with Ed. His input, his ideas, his knowledge helped me to make the right choice for me and saved me money. When we found my condo, we both knew it right away. I was thrilled and he was so excited for me. Ed is more that just a Realtor. He knew I needed some direction in upgrading the unit and he brought the right people together to help me make my condo a real home. I move in tomorrow and my condo is stunning. The neighborhood is perfect for me and I am just thrilled.To tell you the truth Ed is "Your Real Estate Consultant for Life". He did so much for me as he will for any client.  If you are looking for a Realtor who is compassionate, kind, very knowledgeable and funny then run to your phone and call Ed. You will have an amazing experience and I guarantee you will find the home you have always wanted.  Donna P. Phoenix
