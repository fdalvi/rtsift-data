4 Where have all the milkshake made out of milk and ice cream gone??? It seems like they all are made of some slimy chemical product that doesn't even melt. YUCK!   Thank goodness for good ole Dairy Queen! They still make it the old fashion way and I am so grateful! I love their strawberry shake.....but I will soon need to "shake" this craving since each one sets you back almost 800 calories....totally worth it!  I guess if you don't drive through and walk in to get your milk shake, you burn some calories right? TOTALLY EARNED IT!
3 Located inside the Galleria Mall, Dairy Queen was always a treat to get when you came to do some shopping. The choice to be able to get Orange Julius if you wanted something lighter is a nice option.   The staff that work this location are friendly than the ones that work down  the street by Green Valley High School.   My only complaint is that the Blizzards are not frozen enough to create the thick concrete like consistency that they are known for. Mine became soup within a few minutes. The taste was delicious, but I wish it was thicker.
5 Come on its Dairy Queen! Strawberry Banana Julius all the way! with 2 for $5 jumbo hot dogs!
4 I go here almost every time I go to the mall. The Julius's are soooooooo good. I'm completely obsessed with the strawberry banana. Easily the best strawberry banana smoothie I've ever had.
4 I have such fond memories of Orange Julius from when I was a kid.  And you know what they are still really really good. The only reason I gave them a four? It's kind of expensive!!!
