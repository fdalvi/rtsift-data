4 For what it is, I love TJ Maxx! I hate paying full price and love kitchen gadgets so this is a great place for me.  I'm also a big guy so a quick look through the xxl section can sometimes uncover some nice stuff, even though supply is limited.  They are always cool with returns.  They also recently updated the bathrooms and dressing rooms. No big deal, but they are pretty darn nice and the store is always clean.  Happy bargain hunting.
4 I like this TJ Maxx because I often find clothes here. Other TJ Maxx stores I do not have so much luck finding clothes. I love TJ Maxx for the decor selection as well. Most of my apartment is decorated by items from TJ Maxx. The store is kept clean and the dressing rooms are always organized. Along with the friendly staff I love this store, I will forever be a Maxanista!
5 In January I purchased an IT suitcase from this TJ Maxx.  In May, I discovered that the the support for the frame of the suitcase was never finished.  The manufacturer of the luggage essentially told me to go to H..l.  and wanted $25 to ship me a new suitcase under the terms of their warranty.  When I contacted TJ Maxx, they agreed to refund me the purchase price if I brought the suitcase back to there store.  Best deal I ever got.
