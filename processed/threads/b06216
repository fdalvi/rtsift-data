4 Service was good and the food was on point!! I would suggest this place for lunch
2 i I didn't have any problem with food, I mean nothing special but nothing wrong it ( typical bar food) the service was not that great, there was only one lady taking care of the entire bar and she was definitely not able to handle it by herself. My  main issue is that the atmosphere was not that great, I'm not a smoker so I do not enjoy places where I cannot longer smell my perfume lol... well I know most of bar spell a bit like smoke but this one was just too much..  (sorry smokers, I still love u )  Group age: 40's-60's and me!
2 Very nice and attentive staff. Typical bar food. Dive bar atmosphere. Good happy hour prices. Locals hang out. Small. 1 pool table. Nothing impressive, but I'd go back sometime.
