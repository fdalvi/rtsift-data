4 VERY nice. The owner supports soldiers; we used a USO voucher here for a quick last-minute getaway before my husband deployed. The rooms are very clean and seem really updated. The staff is extremely nice and helpful, and the breakfast is pretty good. It's also RIGHT next to Ikea, can't go wrong there!
2 DON'T DO IT . . .  This Quality Inn is anything but quality. Rooms are TINY. . Internet does not work. AT ALL and they have 4 different routers. When you ask the front desk about it they tell you to try to reach one of the other motels internets or maybe Mc Donalds. Told them nicely that it was bad, the said "You've not stayed here before".    Rooms were very small and not ready when we arrived at 6 PM at night.  Chair at desk had broken casters, explained to managment about it, wasn't taken care of.  When I went to shower the second night there I opened the shower towel to dry off and it looked like it had been used to polish shoes.  After speaking to three fellow co-workers about the experence, they stated that thier towels were the same way . . .    I guess it all hotels in the local area were booked and I had to work in the area again . . .  I'd stay again if I didnt' have a sleeping bag for my truck.
3 The Choice Hotel chain continues to be my preferred properties of the mid-$ range hotels.  The only issue I had with this one was the noisy A/C unit in the hallway right outside the door.  Other than that, it was clean with a friendly staff.
4 I'm a little biased because this place is so close to my favorite apartment that I occupied before I had to leave Arizona for work and so close to our new office, too.    Overall, though, this place is the very definition of functional and practical.  There are no frills to be found:  No hot house flowers in the lobby, no water features (other than the pool), no chic artwork on the walls, no spa, no on site restaurant.  One of the light bulbs was out in the bathroom and one in the hallway.  The bed could be a little more comfortable, but those were my only real complaints.  As mentioned in other reviews, the rooms are small, but unless you were reserving the room for a holiday retreat, it definitely serves the purpose of a road warrior.    On the plus side, parking is free and plentiful.  They were more than accommodating to me and my coworkers who stayed here from out of town.  The A/C worked great (vital and all you truly need when camping out in the middle of the desert).  Everything is clean.  Rooms come with a microwave, free internet (which isn't pokey) AND (the mind-blowing part) a refrigerator!  I liked that they have this cute art piece / shelf unit in the bathroom where you can organize your toiletries to your liking.  They also serve a limited but hot breakfast every day for free along with complimentary copies of USA Today and the WSJ during the week.  My little room had a nice view of the sunset in the evening with a cushioned bench seat along the window by which to sit and enjoy it.    Our rate was only $60 a night.  Unbelievable value.  Most of the staff, including the on site manager, were extremely friendly to boot.  I would definitely stay here again!
3 My Grandparents, myself & my uncle stayed in this hotel this past weekend. The hot breakfast every morning was great, the room was clean and roomy enough. However, I do have a few complaints. The sheets were very scratchy and not very comfortable, the bedside lamp wouldn't turn on or off without plugging it in or out of the wall. We could hear every voice outside our door of people walking up and down the hall and talking/laughing. My uncle & Grandfather's room had a broken toilet seat and it didn't get fixed until we complained a second time around 2:30pm. The front desk clerk, Nicole didn't exactly have the greatest personality either. She wasn't rude but appeared to not really know how to do her job very well. When asked for a suggestion on where to get lunch, she suggested the Firebird next to the Elephant Bar and said it was close enough to walk to. It was easily a 10-15 minute drive away at the Mall! Not in walking distance. Needless to say my 78 year old grandparents were not happy. In my opinion the rooms are not worth $149.00 a night. I've stayed in beautiful hotel rooms for a lot less than that in both Vegas and San Francisco. Chandler, AZ is hardly comparable to those cities. Just a suggestion to either upgrade your bedding, maintenance and improve the professionalism (both in appearance and knowledge) or lower your prices. FYI....there were two gentlemen who worked in the evening/night were friendly and super helpful. I wish I had gotten their names. Oh yeah and the cleaning people took my toothpaste when they cleaned and restocked the bathroom!
