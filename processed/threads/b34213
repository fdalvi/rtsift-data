3 Great store furniture is unique.
4 I would like to buy everything in this store! Right now I am on a budget but I plan on buying a few things over the next year.
2 Very unique and interesting pieces however poor customer service. Could hardly find someone to help us when we had questions and not very friendly. Do not expect them to negioate on price - not happening there.  And if by chance you get lucky it won't be very much.  Good thing they have nice furniture b/c  they couldn't survive on their customer service skills.
5 Walked Into this store for the first time today and I was Wowed!!! This is hands down the best and most unique furniture store I have ever been in ( I've been in lots)! Hoping they decide to put one in the North Phoenix area. New homes are popping up like crazy and those people need new furniture! I know the perfect location in a closed down Best Buy at Happy Valley and Lake Pleasant!
5 They are now located at Mayo Blvd. & Scottsdale Road (NW corner).  GREAT prices, fabulous selection and huge variety of styles.  Go already!! Love it!!
