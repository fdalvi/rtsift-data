4 I love the Fountain Bar, the drinks are very cheap, with Fosters only costing £2 a pint, it would make the ideal pub to go and watch the football. I came in here after watching a film at the nearby Cineworld cinema for a pint and after seeing the food prices decided to stay for dinner too. The bar offers meals as well as smaller snacks such as baguettes and sandwiches. I had a tuna mayonnaise baked potato, which was very modestly priced at £2.75 considering the amount of tuna mayo you actually get. I will definitely be returning when I am next in the area. The bar has a traditional feel to it and has a good atmosphere inside. Further, they make a real effort to entertain with Thursday hosting the quiz night and Friday and Saturday hosting live music performances or comedy acts.
5 A complete turnaround from the original Fountain Bar. I wouldn't have been seen dead in this place in it's previous guise. However now it is absolutely my kind of pub! No TVs. Sensible volume music and superb beer. The food is very nice too. It appears to be connected to the Golden Rule (just round the corner) in some way (possibly the same owner). The end result of this is that the beer selection and quality is outstanding. Came here for food last weekend and the fish pie was amazing (see pictures). That is a whole langoustine on top of my fish pie. The beef pie looked great too (I'm planning to try it on my next visit).
3 A decent makeover in terms of decor and stock with increased prices to match. The atmosphere early on a Saturday night was pleasant & the food looked worth a try so a return visit could well be on the cards but I'll be avoiding the steeper priced pints such as West's & Vedett.
