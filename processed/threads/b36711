4 OK, it was kinda fun to watch the little man on my computer screen "take" my order and fake-make my pizza and send it off for delivery in real-time. It was a little startling to hear him address me after the delivery to tell me he hoped I enjoyed the food!  Geekiness aside, the food was made and delivered in under 30 minutes. The driver was friendly and the food was good. I don't know if they're all the same but this one has a variety of sub sandwiches, various chicken wings, miniature parmesan cheese bites (sort of like mini soft pretzels with parmesan), and , of course, pizza. They also have pasta meals.  If you're in a hurry for a quick fix, this place will do.
3 It never ceases to amaze me just how UN-impressed I am when I order a pizza from Domino's.  I guess you get what you pay for.  There's a reason this Domino's is consistently ranked in the bottom tier of their franchise stores.
4 Order delivery a few times a month. The pizza and wings are always hot and tasty (hunger is the best ingredient).  Delivery drivers are usually quick & friendly. They have made mistakes & forgot sauces that were paid for to accompany items I have ordered on more than one occasion. I finally decided to call and complain after the 4th (possibly 5th) time and the manager was very responsive and handled the situation to my satisfaction. We haven't had any issues since.
1 Horrible Dominos! They forgot an item from my order and when I called about it, the way they offered to resolve the situation was like it was my fault.. I should've stuck with my instincts and went for Pizza Hut!   Oh by the way, their pizza is so effin SALTY!! Yuck!!!
