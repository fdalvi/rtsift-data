1 This was the fastest pedicure I've ever had in my life, I'm beyond disappointed and I will never return.  I arrived at 3pm, I was done by 3:19pm.  The decor is horrible, it's like they tried to be classy in the 1990's  it's like thrift store decor. Old products, most of the nail polishes where half empty (I always carry my favorite color in my purse).  Needless to say, I'm very disappointed, I wasn't relaxed, I was uncomfortable, and  it was SO fast and not in a pleasant way.   I will never return and I would never recommend this place,ever!
1 This is worst nail salon in Las Vegas. The salon have old old people doing nails that is so outdated and very ugly. The owner Rose do not know how to do nails, wax, pedicure, or eyelashes extention. There is another old lady named Cammy that everybody should stay away!!!  They are so mean and unprofessional. I will never come back here or recommended anybody to come here.
1 HORRIBLE! We waited 2 hours! I made an appointment and they didn't take us in right away, the nails the lady did weren't pretty, she still wanted to charge so much money We will never return! Horrible service, not worth the money you pay. please stay away I wish I could give this NO stars -.-
3 The pedicure was nice. The woman did a good job. However when I walked in I told her I wanted a full set and a pedicure. She started with the pedicure. Everything was going well until people started showing up.  She got up mid pedicure to fill the tubs for 3 people and did an eyebrow wax.  My foot bath go got cold. She came back finished,  charged me and said see you next time and walked away.  I said what about my full set? She said oh honey I forgot but you can wait till I'm done.  I was so angry! !! Never again.
