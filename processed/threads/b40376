5 Referred from a Facebook friend to the shop. Followed the Facebook page and found out they have great prices on Oil Changes. Just bought a used truck and knew it needed an oil change. They had a Mon, Wed, Thur special. Before 10am get $5.00 off the $19.95 oil change. That's cheaper than doing it myself. Donuts and Coffee in the lobby. Awesome staff. Yes I will be going back and you should go to.
5 work done was professional, fast, and got awsome deal without breaking the bank. im a life time customer and recommend anyone and everyone to stop by. the knowledge of staff and quality of work is a breath of fresh air.
5 I would have walked to Chicago if it wasn't for My Mechanic John! My Mercury Mountaineer had every light lit on its panel. The sudden jerk of my engine's death was the Loudest squeal that my girlfriend has ever emitted. I had nothing to do but to carry her and walk.  John must have the biggest heart in the industry. He towed my SUV, and drove us to the nearest car rental. Once my SUV was fixed, my girlfriend decided to date me again. I owe it all to John. So if your love-life needs repair...start by visiting Gio's Auto to check your engine lights.
5 Took my car to get detailed on a amazon social voucher for the very reasonable price of $100. My car was trashed. I cannot for the life of me keep it clean. Plus when I got the car it had stains in some of the seats (4 door sedan, chevy cobalt 2010 lt) those stains are not as bad as they looked before! The car looks so perfectly clean, I am in love with it! They also offered me a really good deal to fix a little collision! I think I will take them up on that, I am interested in seeing how good they are with other services as well.
