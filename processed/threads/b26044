5 We were on a trip and had to do an ad hoc visit.  Dr. Zhu is really friendly and staff is also nice.  The doctor explains everything well and we are really satisfied.  I would say this is the best dental experience we had.  I wish he could be closer to where I live.
4 Average location, friendly people, they get the job done. I give it 4 because they do what is advertised, and the dentist is a cool guy, but nothing WOW.
1 This is the  worst place I ever been to the place is dirty and the staff eats at their station and the horrible thing i saw is one of the staff picks her nose than touch the in tools the was gonna perform on me so I told her to change her glove this place is dirty and unprofessional I'm referring to the office on Russell
