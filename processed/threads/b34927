4 Had a groupon for this place or else I wouldn't have known about it. It is a healthy alternative with all the grilled meats but it will set you back a little more than your average fast food joint. I recommend adding a salad with pomegranate dressing to any of the kabobs.  The place is not much to look at but the food is tasty.
5 This place has GREAT food... one of the only spots in the Valley where you can find lamb kabob, and their rice is superb!  All of their dressings and sauces are made fresh and taste amazing.  They have daily specials like lamb shank, ghormeh sabzi (a persian stew) and pomegranate chicken.  This is the real deal folks!  Grab some tabbouli, get your gyro fix, or go all out with the lamb shanks.  Either way, I promise you can't go wrong.
1 So we came to this place because there were good reviews (3). But upon arrival we noticed the name was not Zaytoon but Greek Place & Fry. After some debate about that. We went in. It was clean. Only one guy that was incidentally the cashier and the cook. The service was fast considering there were only a couple other people trickling in. Now the food.......I ordered the lamb kabob. The only reason I wanted to come here mind you. And I could swear was beef. But the guy insisted that it was in fact what I ordered and paid extra for. Whatever. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and steak kabobs. Both meals very lemony and VERY tough/chewy. My bf looked like he was trying to bite through a shoe the way he was trying to tear apart the pieces. I was going to tell the guy, but I've come to the realization that complaining to them gets you no where. So I may as well try to inform the unsuspecting public! Long story short we won't be coming back here.
