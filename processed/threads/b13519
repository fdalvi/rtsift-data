4 I love Radio Shack, which is a comment I would not have said prior to today. I was in search of a power cable for my modem which got lost in the move. I didn't have time to go online and find one when I needed on then and now so I hit up Frys Electronics with no luck. They just told me they don't sell anything that could help me; I'd just have to buy a new modem. I hit up Best Buy without any luck and they directed me to Frys Electronics. I informed them that they didn't have anything and they in turn directed me to Radio Shack.   Well, rather than driving out to a Radio Shack, I called ahead, since well, why waste more gas on this search? Well they told me they didn't have any cables specifically for a modem, BUT, they did give me alternatives to my problem. They just told me to bring it in and see if they could find a suitable power source. And Yay! They did! I totally appreciate the fact that they gave me alternatives rather than trying to sell me a new one. They were super helpful and were able to answer my questions and that goes a long way with me.
3 This is your typical radio shack. The employees are nice and respectful but they don't have a clue what they are doing. Definaltly do your research on line before heading in for your item. They seem to always have to look up what I'm looking for.
