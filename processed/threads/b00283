4 Wonderful pizza at good prices. Ask for current specials. Yummy pizza varieties, especially the chicken bacon ranch. Monona Italian delivers deliciousness once again!
4 These folks really care about their pizza. If you don't know subtle flavoring on a pizza, it's possible here. Try walking in to order your pizza--it's an education.
4 Ok pizza. I like Glass Nickel a little better, but this is pretty good. Great delivery service (fast). This is on Monona drive. The address on Yelp is their old address.
