1 I have never been laughed at by a salesperson! I'm not sensitive, I am a seasoned western rider and am shocked at the lack of knowledge and customer service this place has.
4 I recently bought a pair of cowboy boots from there. Nice selection, but rather pricey! I was able to get 20% off which made the purchase more reasonable. They have much more fashionable stuff than the boot barn, and the guy working there helped me pick out a nice pair that wasn't like a lot of the others. Good job!
