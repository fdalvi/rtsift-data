5 Dr. Sinclare is a great Chiropractor.  She takes time to go over your limbs, organs,  and spine.  She's relieved my carpal tunnel syndrome and TMJ with adjustments - NO SURGERY.  I definitely recommend her to anyone who has problems with their limbs, feet, hands, fingers, wrists, ankles, etc.   She does SO much more than spinal adjustments.
5 I have been a patient of Better Health Chiropractic for about 16 years now. They've helped me with everything from emotional release techniques to a blown disc that my regular dr wanted to send me to a surgeon for. They are a great team of professionals. Today's visit was due to vertigo, not fun!  They have extensive knowledge in kinesiology (muscle testing), hormonal issues and nutritional supplementation too.
5 Its amazing just what i was looking for i dont have insurance but this naturaly way and kineslology really is good as it get fantastic more people need to know how to get help mentally physically, emotion, etc. to balance your body highly recommended i been to others and many but this tops them all. thank you for being there to help
