5 These guys were prompt and did everything they claimed all at a competitive price.  What more could you ask for?  I would definitely use them again!
5 We were so happy with Mr. B's Moonwalk.  We just rented the princess clubhouse for our daughter's 4th, and not only was it the perfect fit for 15 children but the service was excellent.  We will definitely rent from them again and tell everyone about them!
5 I worked with Chad from Mr. B's Moonwalk for my kids' birthday party last weekend. From start to finish, I received nothing but the utmost professionalism and personal service. You can tell he really enjoys the service he provides to families and makes an extra effort to make sure his customer is satisfied with their service. I ordered a castle bounce house, along with tables and chairs for our party at the park. He was prompt, the bouncer was clean, and it made it really easy to be able to have them deliver tables and chairs too.  This was the 2nd time we have used Mr. B's and this experience was even better than the first 2 years ago.  I will definitely use them next time I need a bounce house!
5 After a bad experience with a bounce house rental that I found on craigslist I turned to Yelp to find some one to rent a bouncer from for my son's birthday. From the first call that I made to Mr. B's to the confirmation call I received to the delivery, set up and pick up I recommend Mr. B's all the way. Thank you for providing an awesome service.
5 Delivery went off without any problems. The man who delivered was extremely professional and efficient. We were extremely pleased with the service from start to finish and will definitely be using them again for our next party. The bouncy was clean and they brought their own tarp to put under in our dirt yard. Thank you!
