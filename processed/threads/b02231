5 As good as it get's for $4.
3 Just a regular wash inside and out.  Car looked nice when it was done.  Not as good as I would have done it myself, but seeing as I don't do it myself anymore, this is the next best thing for $13.99.    On a different not, the girl that took my money was very unfriendly and rude.   After me, some guy came in and her attitude changed, nice and friendly and smiling.  I hate women like that.  Probably the only job she can get.
2 I've lived down the street from this carwash for years. Since I wanted to removed a think layer of dirt and dust from a car quickly I went here for the quick automated wash. The price was good and all, but the problem happened when I got back home and noticed that the roughness of the automated wash had torn off one of my side mirror panels. I went back there to ask them if they had found it and they let me look around a bit. It had only been no more than 15 minutes since I had left there and it was no where to be found. One of the employees there tried to tell me that it could have slipped under the drain, which is impossible because this panel is over 6"x 8" and would not have slipped through the grate. All I got in response to this was a simple "sorry" and no offer of anything to make it up. I had to buy a $100 replace for both mirrors as they are not sold individually. Personally, since I looked everywhere for it myself, I'm thinking the piece may have been run over by another customer's car after mine and they just threw away the evidence.
4 Easy carwash, fast and not expensive for the budget wash, tho more than it was my last trip here in 2010.  It runs $5 now, was $4 then.   It gets the AZ dust and bird poop off which is all I need.  They are open 9~6, closed Sundays.  Located on the west side of Fiesta Mall.
