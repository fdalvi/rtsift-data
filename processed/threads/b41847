5 I love this audiologist. I got custom ear plugs made by her and I absolutely love them. I wore them to EDC to protect my ears and avoid getting ringing in my ears in the future.  Very thorough and efficient. I would recommend anyone to go see her. She also does audio test, balance test and hearing aid consultation.
