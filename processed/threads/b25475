3 Not the greatest, but not the worst Chinese food. Not a big fan of the prices, but good portions.
5 I ordered curry beef! It was great! But the service was great! They cooked very fast and definitely going back there!
3 Seems like an average Chinese food place.  The menu is pretty standard fare.  I had the Triple Delight lunch special...it was not bad, and the portion is adequate.  Price is very reasonable.  Plenty of parking space in the parking lot.
4 It's your average Chinese fare, but is very flavorful!  I change my selections whenever I order from here, but I have not been disappointed with any of them yet.  My fiance, however, did have a problem with the Kung Pao food because they make it with peanuts, which he is sensitive to.  Other Chinese food places we've ordered from don't use peanuts in their Kung Pao and there's no description of the items on the menu, so it's trial by error if you're sensitive to any foods.  Other than that, we still order from there, enjoy it, and just stay away from the Kung Pao.
4 My favorite Chinese place in AZ.  It took me five years but I found my cheap take out Chinese restaurant!  My son and I order from here regularly and it just seems to get better and better.  We like the green pepper beef and their crab puffs are good.  Their appetizer mix is good also.  Try the spring rolls with their real hot mustard which you have to request.  Very good!!
4 We ordered take out, the service was horrible, very unfriendly the lady didn't say hello or even ask me what I wanted to order, all she said was "yes"... Also, I would not eat in the restaurant, it was about 85Â° with a few floor fans to cool you down, when I asked if the air conditioning was broken she said no and gave me a weird look, ha! But HOLY MOLY, the food was amazing!! Best Chinese food I have had in years!!
