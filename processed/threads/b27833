3 Believe it or not, this place is an Art Studio and Craft Shop - and not a fish mongers.  Misleading names aside, I'm still not sure quite how much I like this place - yes its 'cool', 'funky' and 'hip' - and I love looking at all the stuff in nhere, but frankly there has never been a point where i simply felt i needed to buy anything, even with the staff going on about how cool it all is and how much fun I will have.
4 This is a little art and craft shop tucked away from the usual Stockbridge strip and it's well worth the extra trek to find it.  They're more an arts and craft studio than a gift shop and judging by what they sell it's the perfect place to bring your kids to for an hour or two.  Paper mache, paint glitter and sparkly things are the order of the day and I can see how kids go mad for this stuff. It's certainly brought out the kid in me.  I saw that they had some interesting classes coming up, badge making, card making and the like so it's worth checking out what's coming up when you're there.  They also host birthday parties and I could see 10 kids sitting around the large table getting their art on. All in all a great place for adults and kids alike!
