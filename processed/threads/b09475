2 This Walgreens has the busiest parking lot ever no matter what time of day it is packed! Kind of weird as the store seems empty. It is a standard Walgreens but this one sells liquor. The store is old and run down, the staff seems a bit distant.  I would never go out of my way to shop here, but it does get a pass for convenience.
3 This is usually my go-to spot for filling any Rx's (especially since my surgery), but I find their online ordering inconsistent. Sometimes I get a courtesy email alerting me that my Rx is ready for pick-up, sometimes not. Sometimes I will get an email via walgreens.com with pick-up info, sometimes nothing. I know it's not the stores fault, but it really does frustrate me overall.  This location is decent but at times can appear cluttered and dusty. Customer service is okay too.
2 This store is ghetto in comparison to other Walgreens stores I have been in. The store is not the cleanest in my honest opinion. The shopping center this store is located in is small and the parking lots is always cramped and crowded. I won't go to this location unless I absolutely have to.
