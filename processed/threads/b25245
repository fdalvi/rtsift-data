4 I have been visiting this CVS location for the past year on a regular basis (at least once a week).  I have gotten to know all of the staff and have learned the layout of the story quite well.  I have always received only the best customer service, and rarely do they allow there to be too long of a line at the register before calling a back-up cashier.  The store is much cleaner than most CVS stores I have been in and often showcasing the latest CVS promotions.  The only challenge I ever find going to this CVS is that sometimes it is out of certain products, but that is similar to any other CVS.  I definitely recommend this location as a good CVS in which to shop.  Oh, and definitely take advantage of the Black Friday Extra Care Bucks (ECB) deals as you can score lots of free products!
4 I was in the area and needed to stop by to pick up a few things.  It's located near Paradise Valley and it's what you'd expect from a CVS store in PV....they have some pretty expensive items you don't normally find in a CVS, like patio furniture for $174.99 for instance, LOL: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cvs-phoenix-6?select=Bp1Jl3nK0z89F4HsAoVqFA#Bp1Jl3nK0z89F4HsAoVqFA  Other than that, this is a standard CVS...which I love because I know exactly what I'm getting and where to find it.  Return Factor - 90%
4 Been coming here a lot to fill my prescriptions.  They accept coupons too, so that's a huge plus for me.  This store isn't a 24/7 store, which is a bummer, but at least they have friendly people working there.  Make sure you apply for their in-store discount card to save some money for all your visits.
