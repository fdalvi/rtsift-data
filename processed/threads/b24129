3 Not bad. $40 mani/pedi. I was the only person in the place and they left me sitting in the pedicure chair for quite awhile before getting to me.
4 I think their prices are high but I was assured I'd be able to go several weeks between fills (pink & white). It's been 2 weeks and I know I can easily go another week or two. The owner, Billy, does an excellent job on nails and is very service oriented. Their salon is state-of-the art and clean, which is important to me. I don't like all the cross-client sharing you see in other salons.   They have my repeat business. When I find someone/someplace I'm happy with, I stay!
4 I go here often...I think they have pretty good pricing, and they do a fantastic job.
5 Large/clean nail salon run by a friendly Vietnamese family.  Love the shape that they file my nails to - not too squared off!  Got my first shellac french manicure there last week and it was flawless, still is.  Will be back!
5 They did an excellent job with my elderly mother.  Very gentle with her, unlike some other local places.  Recommend,
5 In Madison for homecoming weekend and found this gem. It's just outside the city, so you can actually Park your car. Honey was not only good company, but did an excellent job on my manicure and pedicure. Very relaxing, spacious setting. I'll definitely go back next time I'm in town.
