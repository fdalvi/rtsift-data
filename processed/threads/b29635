2 We've been here 2x since we moved to Henderson. The 1st time we came we ordered a LG original and split it and each ordered a cup of soup. We were in love. There was a chicken tortilla soup which was delicious and spicy. The other soup was Wisconsin cheddar. SO good and yummy with the croutons on top.  the 2nd visit wasnt so great. we ordered the same exact thing which includes the same sandwich w/no onions and a cup of soup each.  the sandwich came with tons of onions - blah. I hate onions with a living passion and i normally just pick them out but the juice had seeped all thru the bread and everything else.. just wasnt feeling it today so my bf took it back.   they brought us out the same sandwich that still had some of the onions still in it. (they didnt make a new one just picked out a few of them. blah.  we've never been back ever since. If you like onions this is the place for you!!.
5 Best sandwhich on this or any other planet. Amazing. Just about every time we go to the Galleria Mall, we stop in for a sammich. Its a must do. Unique tasting and always good. No other sandwich can compare.
5 Stopped in today to grab a bite to eat to go.   Service was great & the sandwich was delicious! Thank you for a great lunch :)  Your Friends at Sno-Ball Mania!
3 Went here for the first time the other day and enjoyed it.  Had the pepperoni pizza and it was yummy, and cheap at just under 5 bucks! Did wait quite a while for my food though, and when I asked the cashier what was on the supreme pizza she didn't know and had to go ask someone else. hmm.
3 I haven't had Schlotsky's in years so while out running errands I saw one and thought "what the heck"  I came in and the man behind the counter was super friendly, funny and energetic!  However when I went to the pick up window there was a girl just standing there playing on her phone and one more guy in back doing all the cooking.  The line got long as I was waiting for my order and the girl in back, yup still standing there.  The other guy finished my sandwich called my number and off I went.  I walked through the restaurant looking for a table that was clean and did not find one.  Checked the girl in back, yup still standing there.  I wiped a table and sat down to enjoy my sandwich, good lightly crisped bread from the warmer plenty of meat.  Happy girl.  I finished my sandwich the rush was over the friendly funny guy handled the whole crowd on his own and came out to wipe down the tables from the lunch rush and the girl in back, yup still standing there...  Good food, good service by two and a girl standing there earning her paycheck by well, just standing there.
4 good pastrami sandwich on rye!  yum! if youre hungry, go for the largest size, you will be full!
3 My husband loves Schlotsky's, I can take it or leave it. I feel like the sandwich meat is too salty. I do like the toasted bread though. I have never had their pizza so I can't comment. Prices are pretty competitive and if you sign up for their email club they send lots of coupons. The staff is always nice and service has been relatively quick.
4 It was good but it didn't really stand out, the chips however were pretty amazing. Give it a try and see if you like it.
3 Get the original, deluxe on dark rye. OMG!!!
