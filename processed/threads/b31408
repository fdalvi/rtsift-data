1 Avoid at all costs.  Hired their services for a bachelor party in Vegas.  Only 2 of 3 girls showed up and neither of them were the girls that I requested by names off of their website pictures.    They showed up an hour late.  The VIP package that I got was suppose to include a striptease, dancing,  XXXshow, and games.    After doing a striptease for the bachelor only, they started asking for a $100 to do the xxx show which was suppose to be included in the $1000 I had already paid them.  No games, No dancing, nothing.  They came late and left early.  They were very low energy and unenthusiastic, just trying to milk tips left and right with everything they did.  It was a disappointment and I do not recommend this service.  Oh ya, I called them with a complaint the next day and they said a manager would get back to me.  I'm still waiting for that call....
1 Called these guys to try to get a stripper for an all guy bachelor party.  The guy on the line was a grade A ass.  He wouldn't listen to what I was trying to book, kept telling me that there would be an additional charge for women present (because I was a chick calling) and in the end when I told him that he wasn't listening to what I was describing he told me that he was hanging up and that if I called back he would have one of his girls tell me off.  Guess these guys really don't need business. What a horrible experience.
1 I hired a transvestite stripper for a bachellorette party. She was supposed to strip but didn't do anything at all. Did not remove one stitch of clothing. Stood around for a while then started asking US questions like we were supposed to entertain her. Later she told me that she usually only strips for men and was uncomfortable removing clothes for girls. But had zero issue taking $500 for doing nothing. I complained to the company but they didn't care. Don't waste your money.
