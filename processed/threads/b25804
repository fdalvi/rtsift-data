5 They were able to help me right away with great service PLUS they have their own tow truck and prices that cant be beat!! I have recommended to all of my family and freinds and would recommend to anyone. PLUS automatically with NO EXTRA fee you receive a 12 month WARRANTY w unlimited miles.
5 Just a few days ago my transmission started slipping a bit. Then on the 101 it started making some very nasty growling noises. Got into a parking lot and every gear acted like neutral; my transmission was TOAST!  Looked into a lot of different shops and was really starting to question if I should even keep my van or just get a new one because of the high costs everywhere I called for rebuilt transmissions.  I heard about Pete's Transmissions from a trusted mechanic. Because of their reviews on Yelp and a few other places I decided to go for it.   When I called, Erica answered the phone. She was very knowledgeable and answered all of my questions to my satisfaction. When she learned that I drove a van she immediately asked if it was a work van. I said yes and she quickly figured out what it would take to get it done as fast as possible so that I can keep working. My van is my office, warehouse, workshop and lifeblood of my business!  I had my van towed to Pete's Transmissions on a Thursday afternoon. Friday morning Erica called me letting me know I was good to go! Very good turnaround time! My transmission repair included a 12 month warranty and was HALF the cost of most other places I called!  When you show up at Pete's Transmissions it is clear that they know what they're doing and they do it well! My old van is driving better than ever before!
5 I bought a '67 Chevy Malibu and within a week, the tranny gave out. I was pricing all other places and got quotes from $975-1400. Then I came across Pete's and the website was clean &direct. I called and the woman on the phone was very helpful in providing me info and told me $850 out the door.   I thought about it and called back and got a gentleman  by the name of Clyde. He was friendly, confirmed the same info I was already given.  I had the car towed Friday Evening & by Monday I was told she was ready.   The car runs excellent. The tranny is strong and picks up with ease. 110% happy with Pete's Transmissions and would send anyone there who needs Tranny work.
5 Pete's was great. I dropped my truck off at 1:00pm and it was done by 10:00am the next day. They were also the best price I found. It's been two weeks and my truck shifts perfect. Thanks Pete's.
