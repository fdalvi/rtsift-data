1 Incredibly rude service.  There were 4 workers there and only one taking care of the line, the other 3 were busy making waffle cones and ignoring paying customers.   I ordered the hot caramel sundae which in the picture advertised, has at least two scoops of ice cream in it along with whip cream.  I got one scoop of ice cream with a whole lot of whip cream and I was charged full price (around $7). WTF? And to top the insult, if you go in the casino there are a lot of buy one get one free sundae coupons strewn all over the place.    Avoid!
4 I was craving some ice cream after Mystere and made a quick stop at B&J's.  The only guy working was pretty friendly and kept making shakes and serving customers very quickly.  I ordered just a standard cup of ice cream and was pretty pleased with it. I wish I would've tried a shake though :(   I guess I must try one at a local shop. Will return if I'm in the area and craving ice cream again.
1 $9 for 1 damn scoop of ice cream!!!!!!  I stopped here to get one scoop of icecream in a cone and they charged me $8.58!!!  I know this is Vegas but damn!  The scoop was average size and it didn't even taste that good. Never again!!!!!!
