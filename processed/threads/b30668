5 Homemade Fudge.  Lots of flavors plus soup and sandwiches.  Wonderful food and friendly service.  All proceeds go to support compassionate ministries of the Mosaic Church in Florence.  Located in the Historic Silver King Hotel.
5 What a nice place with nice service and YUMMY FUDGE!  I had a really nice salad and my hostess had a great sandwich.  When we walked in the place smelled heavenly as they were baking fresh coffee cake.   To finish we were on our way to a meeting and bought a sampling of fudge --- crazy, but there was Rootbeer flavored fudge and it was amazing.  I'd love to go back and try soups in cooler weather.
2 Meh is exactly right. While the sandwich was just okay...the wait time was unacceptable. Especially at lunch. They really need to have one more person working to get orders out under 30 minutes. There were three of us and only 2 other small groups in front of us and we waited over 30 for our three sandwiches. This was at 11:15 so not even the "full" lunch rush. I try to be patient with small local owened places but this was the second time this happened and so we just won't be able to go back for lunch. As for the fudge... sadly I can't try it because the guy behind the register couldn't answer what type of oil they put in it and I have some allergies.
3 Came and got the fudge; butter pecan, peanut butter cup, and my favorite the caramel vanilla. Good service, great fudge.
2 We've tried to come here several times and it seems like they were always closed even when the sign said they are supposed to be open. We finally caught them at a time when they were open and they had practically nothing in there and the lady behind the counter seemed annoyed that we even walked in. Take it from small business owners ourselves, this is no way to run a business. The fudge was ok but I don't think we'll bother to go back again
