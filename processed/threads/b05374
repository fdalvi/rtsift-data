3 I have starting visiting this place monthly for meetings.  It is nice to get out of the casinos and feel safe walking from the building to my car.  We use a catering company that does a buffet for us.  The catering company works with the Elks Lodge to rent out the space.  It is clean and comfortable.  The microphone always works (which is a big deal for us) and if you feel like a drink you can just go right out to the bar.  Sometimes there are some of the Elks lounging around but nothing to crazy.
5 This place is amazing, jacuzzi, showers, shuffle boards, pool tables, gym, dance floor, main bar and members only bar, free second drink after you purchase your first one, friendly bartender and we got to meet the current DDGER, very friendly! Now after visiting more than 1 Elks lodge during our short stay in Vegas, we will definitely come back to only this one!!!
5 This place is super awesome and extremely beautiful inside boasting the largest western art collection in Nevada.. If you get the chance to come in as a guest you will certainly want to become a member and take full advantage of all privileges that membership includes.
