2 This location of Starbucks let me down yesterday. It was 11am. I had met my sister here before we headed out on the town for the day. I was hungry for a breakfast sandwich or hot sandwich from the fridge that they will heat in the over for you. They were out of almost all flavors of sandwiches, they had only 3 left. They were also out of all breakfast sandwiches including the turkey bacon with egg, I understand that it was 11am but still, most Starbucks have these sandwiches well into the afternoon hours.   I decided to try the faijita chicken sandwich with pepper jack from the refrigerated section at the counter. The cashier was very rude about the lack of sandwiches in the first place. She got irritated that I asked if they had a ham and swiss sandwich when it wasn't out. Anyhow, she heated up the sandwich and wrapped it up for me. The chicken was disgusting and I pulled a couple of pieces out and they had black spots on them. I am not sure how long that particular sandwich had been sitting out but eww.  I did also have a passion tea and it was delicious as usual. Rule of thumb, come here only for drinks, avoid the food at this location. I would only come back for coffee or tea. Customer service was also not the greatest.
3 Nice mall location. Indoor and outside seating. Very clean indoor seating area. Drinks were very good  and the service was fast. The Starbucks is located just outside the food court near Valet parking.
2 Wedge shaped inside and very cramped. There's about 15 people crammed around the pickup counter, the condiment stand is not accessible at all. Then when it cleared,  there are other cream carafes.  Starbucks deliberately keeps the stores small like this so their sales per square foot metric comes in high. There's one store I've been in that's. It cramped and this is not it. Boise ID on State St. should be their model.
