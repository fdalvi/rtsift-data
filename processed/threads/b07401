3 If I say it wasn't as bad as I was expecting is that good?  2.5 stars.  I have only eaten at a JB's once.  That was in Price, UT probably 3 or 4 years ago.  It was memorably bad.  So when I offered to pick up lunch for an employee and they picked this place I was expecting the worst.  I went in with diminished expectations.  I played it safe with a BLT, fries and a shake.  It was OK!  Yay!  The BLT was actually almost....well...pretty good.  Hey that wasn't as bad as I thought it would be!
2 Well, for me this place was a dud.  I arrived this Tuesday morning at 10:30 to be told that there was a breakfast buffet, but they were getting ready to put it away so I'd have to bite down fast.  I didn't want to do that, so I took a booth & asked to see a regular menu.  I decided to order a club sandwich, along with the help-yourself soup & salad, but was advised that I couldn't get THAT because it isn't put out until after 11 AM.  Ok, I said, just bring me the sandwich & a bowl of soup.  "We don't have soup until after 11 AM."  I settled for just the sandwich.  The service was slow & poor.  I ate my sandwich & left.
4 This is just a basic (albeit mini) chain greasy spoon. I had a decent burger with guac and soda. I would give three stars, except for a) good service and b) relatively low prices. I'd probably return if hungry nearby and a Costco meal was not appropriate.
2 Having now tried & reviewed almost every buffet in Arizona (about 7 to go, mostly 90+ mi. away), I've been doing updates, & particularly trying to boost up some places that didn't fare well the first time.  This JB's was one of those, so when I heard they were having a "Special Father's Day Dinner Buffet" tonight, it seemed time to wheel back in here & give them a chance to get up to 3 or 4 Stars.  Unfortunately, the "big deal" tonight, wasn't.  There was really good Cream of Potato Soup, & the salad bar was ok, but the hot food was limited to slices of turkey, ham, potatoes & gravy, mashed sweet potatoes, & that's about it.  There wasn't even much dessert, & the whole thing came across to me as really weak.  I had a different waiter this time, but again the table service was amateurish, & the weird architecture of this building is a minus too.  It wasn't long before I was wishing I was at the opposite diagonal corner of this big shopping center, eating at the excellent Great China Super Buffet instead.  I enjoyed my visits to JB's on Northern, & also the one over in Litchfield Park, but this location is just a lost cause.   :-(
2 = = = = = = CLOSED = = = = = =  This JB's location, with it's poor building layout, poor service & mediocre food finally folded.  Good riddance!     :-)
