4 My hubby has been wanting to buy a vaporizer for a couple months now, so this past Saturday around 9:30pm we decided to go check some out. He had heard that this place recently opened & wanted to take a look. This place was well lit & had a huge selection of pieces, bongs & hookahs. We saw a few vaporizers in the display case & asked the dude working there about them. Then shortly into our convo the manager came out & introduced himself. They were both very helpful & knowledgeable. We ended up buying one & the manager gave us $5 off. A couple things I thought were pretty cool: the humidifier room with cigars & wraps & the huge, stone fountain/waterfall in the back of the shop that they said would be completed soon. Oh & above the humidifier room & fountain/waterfall were the address looking #s 420, nice. We'll definitely be back!
5 I happen to be staying in a new area of town and love to explore places around me, especially smoke shops!  I read about this one on line and the reviews on line were great!  From the outside it looks rather small but when I walked in it was definitely a breathe of fresh air.  I had never seen this atmosphere in a smoke shop.  The waterfall I read so much about wasn't working but still looked amazing and now I have a reason to go back.  The girl that was at the counter was very pleasant, let me browse without hounding and told me about the store.  I am not a "piece" expert or anything but they were very nice looking ones.  If you want to try a new place to get your herbal incense, hookah, or any other smoking needs I recommend at least stopping in to see how cool and different Herb n Legend is.
2 I would have given a much better review a month ago, but they're having hiring and inventory issues keeping e cigs in stock and they're liquid e cig prices are more pricey than other shops. Love the manager and the gentlemen. The new young woman needs training in customer service and product/inventory knowledge.
5 Herb N' Legend is an awesome store. They have a huge variety of products for good prices. The employees are very nice and helpful; plus the 20% off glass coupon code works. I would definitely recommend going here and I plan on making more purchases here.
4 They have redeemed themselves! It was brought to my attention by two very professional & courteous staff members that their inventory manager fell ill & is in the hospital. They're by far the best smoke shop in town. Lots to choose from and great e cigarette flavors!! Love them!
5 Herb N' Legend has everything! All their products are good quality and they carry a variety of kratom. One of the best things about this shop is that they are open on sundays until 11pm! I will definitely be going back.
5 Easy review to write. Definite 5 stars from service to selection. Seriously, you can't go wrong with this shop. I appreciate the deals too!
5 This place was awesome! The workers are very knowledgable and made sure that I didn't walk out with a subpar piece of glass. They even let me see the differences between two pieces I was interested in and filled them with water so that I could see which was smoother. They really care about your happiness here and they want to make sure you're satisfied. I went in and a haul that would've cost me $250+ cost me $207. They gave me a larger deal than what they have on yelp. Also, the guy that worked there told me that they give people discounts all the time. I definitely recommend this place!
4 This is probably the best smoke shop ive been to in the area. They have a very large variety of items from glass, tobacco and cigars. They have the widest options of hookah supplys and flavors that ive seen in any store. This os a place i'll be sure to go back too.
