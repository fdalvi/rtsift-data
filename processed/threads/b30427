3 Well It's the strip ENOUGH SAID!
2 Too much gahdamn walkin'..but I'm just lazy..sometimes.   & them peeps handing out newdz. I don't wanna see boobies of random girls all over the place!   That is all.
5 Oh common now... How can you NOT love the Las Vegas strip? When it comes down to walking the strip... having a drink.. to seeing people getting arrested... you will have the time of your life!  Make sure you do come with someone else (especially if your a female) for safety purposes as there is a lot of drunks that walk the Strip (duh!).  Also Women... I have seen lots of you wear High Heels... common now you need to bring your walking shoes when you come out here! At the end of the night you're walking bare foot anyways.   Have a fun time and Enjoy Beatiful Las Vegas!
4 This is the heart of Las Vegas...flashing neon lights, hotels, shopping, restaurants, the gorgeous Bellagio Fountain, women/men passing out porn fliers, and everything else imaginable can be seen on the strip. Let me warn you, it is a b**ch trying to get from one end of the strip to the other due to traffic.
3 Well everyone should experience The Strip of Las Vegas at least once in their lifetime! Is like nothing else. Is visually interesting, specially at night with all the lights. Yep you will see tons of tourists, lots of young drunk people acting like idiots, some men and women completely passed out in the sidewalk, families, some arrests, street performers, some women showing off their bodies of all shapes and sizes, shoppers, people passing all kinds of flyers, and some people well, just walking the strip.   Regardless of your purpose in Vegas, there is a lot of things to see and do during the day, and well during the night! All Hotels/Casinos have great places to be entertained, party, drink, shop, dine in.  For first timers, if your planning to walk the whole strip, wear comfortable shoes! There is tons of walking and even if the buildings you are going to seem close, the walking paths are long, mostly because you have to cross the streets by crossing bridges with added pathways that add to your walk. Others walk through the casinos  which seems like it adds miles on your walk, because some are like mazes from the inside.   Also, for those enjoying the nightlife, planning to dance, and looking all good for the rest of the night, walking should be avoided. You will sweat, mess up your hair, and your feet won't be happy with you.   The best way to get from point A to point B,  is by taking a taxi. Of course, this means having taxi spending money. On average about $10-$12 bucks plus tip. If your in a group, is only a couple bucks each person. Lastly, the traffic is slow, so if you got to be in a place at an specific time (example if your going to one of the shows) give yourself plenty of time to get there. Traffic is heavy in the the night. You can drive anywhere, but good luck finding parking.
4 Definitely a unique place in this world. Something you have to see in your lifetime!  Be prepared for the ultimate culture shock. You can seriously see ALL different types of the human race here. Between awkward business professionals in suits, "drunk of their mind" chicks wearing almost nothing, total white trash, rednecks, bachelors, and more, you are in for the ultimate experience!   The resorts/casinos here are a hit or miss. Some of them are total dives! I simply can't understand how they are still profitable. They must serve the clowns that enjoy stench bucket lobbies filled with smoke, cheezy dancers, and constant gamboling.  I swear some of the casino floors look like a Chuck E. Cheese for adults with all the bright, flashing lights!  One of my biggest pet peeves here is those stupid clowns that hand out those "hot girls want to meet you" cards!! Seriously! They swarm you on every corner. They will even have four of them in a line trying to get you to take them. Come on Las Vegas, clean up your act! Most of the cards with pictures of women with no clothes on end up as litter on the ground anyways. Outlaw that stupid BS! If people are looking for those kind of services, they can easily find a way to use them! Those stupid cards aren't going to change their minds!   I did notice there were none of these stupid clowns outside the Wynn and Encore properties. Maybe it's the demographic there? Or maybe they actually have a policy against it. Either way, I would stay there for that reason alone!!  As other Yelpers mentioned, even though neighboring properties look close, they are actually a long walk! Pedestrians are often slowed down by the constant overcrowded  sidewalks and are redirected over these bridges with TONS of stairs! They are not right at the intersections either, mostly trying to force you into shops or casinos. Keep in mind, there is always a way to get back down, you just have to find the stairs.   Bring comfortable shoes if you plan to walk the strip. Also, many of the so-called trams and the famous monorail are sometimes not practical. The stations are located in the VERY BACK parts of all the casinos. By the time you walk all the way through one casino (especially if you are staying on the West side of the strip, you have to cross the street and enter another resort to pick up the monorail), get on the monorail (they charge for tickets too) and walk all the way down from the casino you disembark at, you miswell should have just walked to your destination the whole way.  Some of the cab drivers are absolutely nuts!! I seriously thought this one dude was going to roll the Ford Escape we were driving in on some of the turns. Our ride from the airport wasn't that bad though. Splurge for a town car one night to make your experience more enjoyable (we took one from the Cosmo to Wynn for a fancy dinner at SW Steakhouse).   Enjoy your time on the strip!
5 Fun to go sight seeing both during the day and at night. The bright lights at night are a beautiful sight too! Make sure you have comfy shoes on since you're going to be walking around a LOT and don't forget to hop from one hotel or casino to another for sight seeing and a little gambling. :)
4 The Las Vegas Strip is nothing but a tourist attraction to draw in $$$ for the city of Las Vegas. It also has some of the best entertainment venues that are PG rated to XXX, casual to fine dining that are owned by world renowned chefs and some of the most opulent 5 star hotels that you can't find anywhere else in the world like Wynn, Encore and Bellagio all created by Steve Wynn.  It also attracts tourists from all over the world but mostly Europeans and Asians because of the gaming and entertainment industry. Also the usual drunks, douche bags, pick pockets, hustler's, hookers, lost tourists and some Californians.   Enjoy!  Have Fun!  Stay Safe!
4 As wonderful as the strip is..... it can get hot, crowded, and gross. You know... mixing with the hoi polloi and all. It's still an indispensable part of "Vegas!" though so I'd recommend doing it when you've been to vegas a couple times already and strolling this at night to watch the volcano/ water shows with your non-party friends/ parents.
5 In preparation for a Vegas list I am putting together for future reference, I am back tracking on this review from a few years ago when I saw U2 and spent a few days in Vegas. It is a long walk, almost an hour from one end to the other, however, walking through all the nice hotels from one end to the other, the shops, passing through cheesy souvenir shops etc is worth it. I do this more for the people watching than the actual shops themselves. I collect those 1-800 escort cards that are handed out day and night on the strip as cheap souvenirs back home for my male friends. The models on the cards are better than those that are advertised in the Vancouver Georgia Straight. If you're too hot a lot of hotels are air conditioned and if you hate walking outside in general most of the hotels are connected. You can even drink your alcohol in cheesy themed cups.
4 If you look at the Las Vegas Strip as entertainment and not a place to strike it rich, then you should have a nice time here.  I've been here a couple of times over the years, with nothing particular in mind.  It's has the draw of the old Times Square has for me.  A little bit of an adrenaline rush with amusement park like sights and sounds.    We've been here mostly when it's been cool and comfortable, so walking is always been enjoyable.  To catch the full Las Vegas experience, I would recommend: New York, New York;  MGM Grand; Planet Hollywood, Bellagio, The Mirage, Caesar's and Steve Wynn's place at the upper end of The Strip.   For what it's worth, I've never been a fan of Circus Circus  If you have time, try the monorail if it's working.  At the other end, the Freemont ceiling is a must!  Enjoy
4 Sin City is an inferno! Keep cool and drink plenty of beer. Or water. Or alcohol loaded slushies in an endless cup.
3 Something you have to experience once in your lifetime, Las Vegas strip is about doing bigger, better, brighter and having more then your neighbour. As a tourist, you get to see the spoils of a war on profits and greed while casino after casino battle it out to be the best.   Positives - These hotels are so gigantic, it's hard to fathom. You can look down the strip and think that the neighbouring hotel is "Right next door" but it's a long walk! After staying a weekend at a hotel, chances are that you still haven't seen all of it and getting lost is a ritual. It's also easy to forget how impressive each and every hotel is. Take your time and soak it in.   The weather is so hot and unbearable by itself, but every 20-40 feet is another entrance to air conditioned casino's. It's a dry climate but over every bridge has someone selling bottles of water at $1ea. You can also drink alcohol in public without worry of arrest.   There are a tonne of attractions. There is a vegas handbook that does a great job of listing them, the prices and the free attractions as well as restaurants, ratings and pricing. Plenty of them are free to view in the middle of a mall or casino(Volcano or Atlantis) or outside(Treasure Island Sirens or the Bellagio) The Las Vegas shows are usually worth the price you pay. The price escalates from the lower end ($18) to the higher end($175 or $200+ for VIP seating) so you can make it fit your budget.   There is lots to do and the city never sleeps!   The negatives - Anytime you have plenty of tourists, you will have panhandlers so be prepared. Signs stating "Homeless" or people sleeping with a puppy and looking for handouts is common. The musicians with a hat open I support at my level of personal enjoyment. The absolute clowns with the signs(And there were a number of them) saying "$20 to kick me in the balls" were hard to understand.   Having the allowance to drink alcohol in public certainly has it's drawbacks. Fights, drunken stupors, vomiting, loud and obnoxious are all around. If you don't see an arrest for drunk and disorderly, you must be out before 2pm. Broken bottles are seen but to the strips commendation, they are quickly swept away.   BEWARE - The Strip is a hotspot for cons. If a guy approaches you to offer anything, make sure you are aware that it may be a scam. Cheap tickets to a concert, a "complimentary" picture with Michael Jackson, showgirls or even the transformers Bumblebee will come at a price. We even had a group of guys offer us a "Free CD of their music" including autograph before demanding payment. Keep a close eye on your belongings. Everything in Vegas comes at price.   Speaking of price... The add ons to "sales" are extraordinary. Be aware of what you are getting into. We had a great meal at a restaurant for only "$33 each" for my wife and I. The final bill was $144. Why? The three drinks and one desert that we shared, taxes and gratuity made up the balance! Everything seemed to be more. Even the 4 shirts that we bought for $60 from a street vendor somehow got a $12 tax attached in an area that has an 8% sales tax for LICENSED merchants, which this individual was not. I handed over $65 total in mutual agreement. My wife and I ordered a coffee each. After being asked if we wanted syrup, sugar, cream, flavor shot etc to make our coffee the way we like, our final bill was $17.80! Arguing won't get you anywhere... Just be aware of any charges BEFORE you commit to anything!   Kids and the strip - IN MY OPINION, this place is NOT for kids. Scantily clad woman are everywhere, bad language, drunks, trucks adorned with pornography(slightly censored) and people handing out cards of naked women on every corner to anyone make this an adult playground.  Water use is confusing, irresponsible and mismanaged for a desert with little reserve. No "waterless" urinals, lots of spray and pools... I was disappointed at the lack of "green" awareness. Even cans and bottles and plastic lay everywhere with NO recycling? Is this 1992??  Finally - Although Las Vegas is an incredible experience that you can't get anywhere else, It's just not my thing. The drunks, poverty and amount of conning, even from coffee shops, is not something that I like to be reminded that society can be. Those clickers that hand out cards of naked women on every corner absolutely disgust me. Peddling prostitution without shame to anyone walking by is, in my opinion, wrong. These are just my views as a fun, christian family man who enjoys an alcoholic bevvie and doesn't wince at swears. Personally, I hate gambling. The house always wins so you might as well light $100 on fire. It may be more suitable to the 21-25 yr old crowd or gamblers but everyone should see it once. This review was more personal then I normally like, but the material is definitely of a personal nature. Hope this review helps!
5 Cosa dire di Vegas... What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, Baby! Questa città è incredibile perché è fintamente bellissima ed ogni volta che si torna si scopre un nuovo pezzettino.
5 The Las Vegas Strip is an absolutely magical place filled with wonder and delight! The casino buildings are massive and have the most creative architecture and design. The details of the design are most visible during the day but at night they take on their own unique look. When all of the casinos are lit up, the strip is so festive and fascinating! In my opinion, Vegas was made for the night. That's when it comes to life!  Some attractions you can find while walking the strip are the fountains at the Bellagio, the gondolas at the Venetian, the pirate show at Treasure Island and the water wall at Aria. There are also street performers along the strip as well as costumed actors who will allow you to take photos for a tip.  If you plan to be sober during your trip, you can attempt renting a car and driving on the strip. Just be aware that the cabbies pretty much rule the road and are very aggressive drivers. I recommend walking and taking a cab for longer distances ESPECIALLY if you plan to drink. You can also weigh out the pricing. Rental cars generally are $50 a day and unless you are driving to every casino, it's most likely that you will NOT spend this much money on cabs each day. My husband and I went the cab route and spent on average $20 per day for the both of us.   I personally feel that the Las Vegas strip is a 21+ type of party, however if you are planning on bringing a family with young children, consider the following things that you may see on the strip: Intoxicated individuals, racy clothing, partial nudity, lots of alcoholic beverages, peddlers with inappropriate signs, people handing out prostitution/strip club ads showing naked women, ad trucks that go up and down the strip with naked women on them and last time I went there was a random arrest so i'll throw that one in too. Again, this list is just to let parents know what can be seen by their children if they plan on coming on a family vacation.  I have had so many good times here, I love the strip! There are tons of awesome things to do in all of the casinos and I think it's a great experience. Definitely the ultimate party spot! Now it's time to start planning your trip! :)
4 Some days it's better than others... If people weren't so rude, obeyed the traffic laws and actually paid attention to the stop lights there'd be a lot less headaches & swearing.
3 If Las Vegas was a movie, The Strip would be the big star. According to the Ritz-Carlton's Foursquare, the Strip is home to 19 of the world's 25 largest hotels.   Most of Vegas's famous hotels and casinos are here, so if you come to Vegas for a vacation (most likely you will be, but I don't want to assume it because people do come here for other reasons), you will most likely spend some time on the strip.  The Strip looks impressive even driving through it, but don't limit yourself to your car, even if it's hot outside. There's lots more inside the hotels and casinos and you can see a lot more by walking around.  The Strip also gets very hot during the summer (even at night!), so bring water. You'll most likely be parking at a hotel/casino and walking everywhere.  Thanks to pedestrian bridges that go over the street, you won't have to cross a street as many times as you would on any other city street. However, this makes for a lot more walking.  Like any popular tourist area, there are lots of homeless people, some of which give me the creeps. Walking down the strip at night is also not fun because of the drunks and all around rowdiness. There are also a lot of oblivious, obnoxious tourists. People, I know the strip photographs beautifully, especially at night (it really does), but step out of the way when you're doing your picture taking. Too often will people stop in the middle of a large crowd to take a picture. My suggestion? Snap some shots when you're already waiting for something. That way you won't be in anybody's way. Snap a few photos while you're waiting for the Bellagio fountains to start. Take a few shots while you're waiting to cross the street (but keep an eye on the walk signal!)  Despite the creepiness, The Strip is really something that must be visited when you're in Vegas!
4 The Strip is freakin' amazing day & night. Beautiful lights & fun everywhere!! There is always lots of promotions & deals at hotels & don't forget about the Deuce Bus that runs through the whole entire strip from Mandalay Bay Hotel ALL THE WAY TO FREMONT STREET.  You HAVE to experience Vegas AT LEAST ONCE in your life time. So much to do!! I love it so much!!   The only reason I gave it 4 stars & not 5 is cuz I hate that the cross walks are so far away from each other. It makes us stay in the sun longer, but at least every single building has air conditioning.
1 What a slimmy rip off dump. Everybody has their hand out. Street performers, beggars, pimps. On the crossover by the Cesar's  I watch two 3 card monte operations within 25 feet of each other. There are 3 card monte crews up and down the strip. The cops don't seem to care. Being a New Yorker I remember Times Square before Disney screwed it up and at its worst it wasn't as bad as the Las Vegas Strip is today. They say when the old regime ran Vegas it was a much better place. The only crime allowed was what they committed. They took care off problems.
2 The strip is a party zone chock full of street performers, con artists, pan handlers and prostitute hawkers.  If you go to Vegas for the "strip" you might love it if you have these expectations.  However, if you come to vegas for specific entertainment (shows) and features, the strip might be more of a nuisance, and that's where my visit falls.    I couldn't walk a half block without being accosted (for lack of a better word) by any of the above people looking for a way to part a me from my money, using claims of "Free" or "I do this for tips" and so on.  When I walked away from some of these folks I started getting attitude.  That's not to say there aren't some legitimate people trying to make a legitimate living on the strip, I've just met enough people in various places that have quelled my level of trust when meeting strangers, especially those who claim to want to sell me something for "Free" on the street.  There is a good deal of sightseeing on the strip if one can get past the strangers who want your cash, each hotel and casino is unique in its own way.  Each public show on the street is unique as are many of the small shops and stores.  When walking the strip, one needs to keep in mind, they don't call it "Sin City" for nothing.
2 Just came back from Las vegas today and it was a pretty great weekend Except for one thing. That one thing is the the con artists roaming the strip night and day. Beware of wannabe artist and their "producers" who will try to give u a FREE CD and say they just want to get recongition. THAT IS TOTAL BS DO NOT FALL FOR THEIR SWEET TALK AND SHIT THAT THEY SPIT OUT. After handing my friend the CD the artist start asking for a donation which my friend gave but than the producer came over and said that I should give him another $5 to make it a $10. After that things got messy because they were pretty insistent on me giving them another $5 so i asked them why. The producer than said " oh because the CD cost $10". WHAT KIND OF F$%#ING BS IS THAT?!?!  First they will say they are giving you a free CD but than they will try to get money off of u so beware of those freaken lowlife scam artist. Also if they ask for your name DO NOT GIVE IT TO THEM. They will just sign your name on their CD and try to force you to pay a rediculous amount for that CD.   God LV strip became a dump for trash like those, feel bad for those that are actually legit street performers.
5 First time and went in Dec.  The weather was nice while my east coast was freezing...oh well.  One of a few places where you can walk and ride with an alcoholic beverage, see performances and hop to restaurants casinos, shops and more in a 6 mile strip!  We loved it and hung out all day and night.  Not a place for kids at all!   New Orleans (havent been) and Seoul, S. Korea are the other cities that we drank on the street that I know of.  Viva Las Vegas!
4 Reading all the reviews of the Strip here on Yelp, I'm taken with the huge range of ratings and opinions of this 4+ mile of road. Yes, it has the best of things, and yes, it has the worst of things. I suppose one's rating reflects what aspect/s of this famous terrain one focuses on. I focus not on the homeless guy sleeping against a wall but instead I marvel at the neon bombardment of colors. I focus not on the thousands of flyers underfoot of naked women, advertising escort services, but instead I am enchanted by the dancing fountains, the music, St. Mark's Square and the Eiffel Tower and the New York skyline in close proximity to each other.   Let's face it: this is one of the most iconic geographical places in the US - probably the world, actually. It is immediately recognizable by young and old alike. Of course it has the most of the most of everything. That is part of its charm.  If you decide to walk the Strip, be prepared for a hike. It's deceptively long when you take into consideration all the criss-crossing, traversing, up and down stair walking and escalator riding you will do. On my recent trip here, a good quarter of the escalators were not working and a lot of construction was going on. If one were disabled, one would have a hard time indeed navigating some of these overpasses.   There are some fun and funky shops, malls and stores along the way to explore and God knows, lots of restaurants. We enjoyed going into all the major casinos/hotels to get a feel of the various themes, the architecture and artwork. I consider much of the Strip to be like a Disneyland for adults. Half of it looks like a movie set, with pirate ships and Roman colliseums within a block or so. Outlandish - but again, this is part of the charm that is Vegas. We loved going into Caesar's and riding the circular escalators and checking out the uber-high-end boutiques, and visiting the centrally-located Sephora. My folks went to the mall housing Macy's but I opted out, having all these stores in Seattle. There's the "Fashion Center" and the M&M shop. One can spend the day - or more! - just walking and checking out all the stores and hotels and street musicians, and get one's fill of entertainment without spending a dime.  I was there at Christmas-time, and I must say, the decorations in the hotels and along the square by the Venetian were simply gorgeous. In fact, they had outdoor festivals at night by the Venetian tree (which was glorious), and they were mesmerizing. Who needs to gamble to have fun?   One point of note: unbeknownst to us, you cannot flag down a cab to drive you to your destination, so if you get tired walking, you'll have to somehow crawl to a taxi stand outside a hotel to legally catch a cab. There's a city law that forbids cabbies from picking up passengers who aren't at a legit cabbie stand. Who knew???
4 I came right after the New Year for my birthday thinking that everyone was gone already... nope, the party's still going! I walked here during the day and thought it was okay. During the night? That's when our fun start!! The lights were just amazing and really had us pumped up!  With shows, shops, casinos, and buffets all given to us on one long street, we had plenty of things to keep us busy. However, it does get pricy so I would definitely come when you have the cash to burn. Otherwise, you can just watch people gamble, attend free shows, and window shop.
4 In Vegas, but don't feel like partying and getting drunk? Check out the strip! It will keep you busy and entertained for a while.  Pretty much, everything is on the strip: all the hotels, food, shows, drinks, bars, clubs, shopping...  It's alright in the daytime, but it's super nice at night with all the lights. I had fun just walking around and going to each themed building and taking pictures and watching some free shows on the street (like the fountains in front of the Bellagio or the fire show in front of the Flamingo).  The sidewalks are really weird though. You have to take ramps up into some buildings to continue walking sometimes. And despite the down season after NYE, there's still a lot of people walking around!  Overall, it's a cool strip to check out and it's a good cheap and fun alternative if you don't want to spend too much money.
4 A Las Vegas landmark!  Most everyone knows about the Las Vegas Strip.  All the most popular Las Vegas Hotels are located on this road.  I believe the Strip is about 4 miles long.    If I have to be on the Strip, then I much prefer walking.  The traffic can be so terrible at times when driving.  Especially in the evening, the Strip is very lively and lit up.  There is entertainment and fun everywhere.  If you are a first time visitor to Las Vegas, then you must visit the Las Vegas Strip!!    My two favorite destinations on the Strip are the Venetian hotel and the Bellagio!  The Venetian hotel gives us just a teeny little taste of Italy.  The Bellagio hotel and their Fountain Show outside simply amazes!  Have fun and be safe!
5 this place was so much fun... I spoke to the cop right outside out hotel at PH - he said it's really not legal to drink on the street but they're tolerating people until they start acting like kids. Haha
2 Going down.  Every time I go to Vegas walking the strip is part of the trip. Like it or not. It would seem to me that on my annual trips the amount of crap along the strip has increased quite a bit. I have been going regularly since 2004 and in that short period the "Class" of the strip has gone down. There are too many card clickers, ppl with horrible low budget costumes clogging sidewalks ( especially out front of Bellagio), crispy bums, people selling water, people aggressively  "giving" away home made cd's.  I expect this kind of bush league crap on Fremont street but it would be nice if I didn't have to deal with it on the strip. I didn't see any police presence and I saw 1 staff from Bellagio watching the gong show along the sidewalk in front of the fountains.  ITS SUPPOSED TO BE CLASSY VEGAS!!!  Smarten up. Ship this crap off somewhere else where they can exercise their rights.
4 If I lived here I would probably be dead in a year. LOL! Walk the strip and view the freak show that is AMURRICA!  Sure, when in Vegas it's almost mandatory to take a walk on The Strip to view the sights. To me it's always better at night when everything is lit up in all it's cheesy glory! Plus, if there during the summer season walking The Strip in the day is inviting heat stroke! Damn, it's hot over here.   Don't get fooled by the optical illusion thinking that the casino you want to walk to is close as after shlepping a half hour you realize you should have taken a cab, the monorail, or the shuttle that runs along The Strip. Still, the views of the massive casinos all lit up and the free shows make it worth a trek up and down The Strip. The Pirate Show at Treasure Island, the Volcano at the Mirage, the Dancing Waters at the Bellagio to name a few.  Hey, at least you are allowed to drink in public here so load up a cold one and have at it as you walk by the hordes of tourists, Eurotrash, bachelor and bachelorette parties, and assorted middle America white trash WalMart crowd that seems to gather here. Don't forget to view the crazies, homeless, porn card slappers, bad street performers, drunk blotto people, and those annoying characters in knock off costumes posing for money. The craziness never ends! It's almost like being in Times Square NYC!  The Las Vegas Strip is an amusement park of kitschy weirdness in itself. I love cheesy and approve totally!   As Arnold would say - "I'll Be Back"!
5 Vegas baby Vegas! Been coming to vegas for years. I still love all the lights and the glow of Vegas night life. They are constantly changing things and its only getting better as the years pass ...
4 My favorite part of Vegas - right here.  Sure it's nice to walk around in the daytime, but it's better in the night. Why? Because that's when everything is completely lit up! Keep those cameras handy when you're walking around here. You can even take some pictures of certain areas of the strip when you're walking on the "overhead" crosswalks. It's not just the lights to enjoy, but also some of the free shows that are available, including Mirage's Volcano and Bellagio's Dancing Water Fountains.  Be mindful of your surroundings when walking around, especially in the night. Sure it's touristy, but as what some other reviewers pointed out, there were some sketchy people hanging around (panhandlers, con artists, etc.). For this reason, I take away one star.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely be back here!
3 starting to look old and a little run down.
5 Vegas is an adult Disney World. Don't get me wrong, I love Disney World (even as an adult) but it's so much funner with good food and booze. Plus you can still see Minnie Mouse - except in Vegas she's twerking on the sidewalk for tips. No seriously, there's people dressed up as characters everywhere on the stirp!  I think the Vegas Strip is one of the best values in entertainment. Well, because it's basically FREE once you arrive to Vegas. Hopping around from hotel to hotel, seeing how amazingly detailed the designs and architecture are it really is an adult playground. Want to go to Paris? No problem! Want to go to Egypt? Just a few more steps that way. Have  a time machine handy to go nose to nose with Ceasar? No need - he's chillin' in his pallace right over there.  My highlights would be:  Bellagio - This is one of the nicest hotels on the strip and their lobby has that insane glass art on the ceiling. The fountains are possibly the most impressive sight on the strip. Plus, there's a mini chocolate waterfall. Must see.  Luxor - I've always wanted to go to Egypt and while I am sure the Air Conditioned lobby of the Luxor is a bit more comfortable than actual Cairo the attention to detail here is amazing. Statues that feel stand 100 feet tall, and the entire building is in the shape of a pyramid. Fun fact: The elevators go SIDEWAYS up the side of the pyramid!   Caesars Palace: Such a nice hotel! The decorations and designs are phenomenal! They have amazing fountains and statues patterned after Rome. They even have their own Coliseum - but instead of fighting to the death you can pay a ton of money to hear people sing!   New York, New York not only has one of the best exterior designs (looks like the NY skyline!) but, it also has a roller coaster and the inside looks just like New York with a late night pizza spot open behind the casino.  Paris is cool with the mock Eiffel Tower and the inside has some mock balconies that indeed look like the streets of Paris.  Excalibur is probably best for kids - or ladies that want to feel the Thunder Down Under!   The Venetian has gorgeous painted ceilings (like clouds) and you can ride a gondola through the hotel!   Mandalay Bay is cool, but being from Florida you won't find it too fascinating. It's all "tropical" and basically reminded me of the resorts in the Bahamas.  Wynn -  There are no outside attractions here - instead it's all inside so you HAVE to come in to see them. Went to Vegas once, close to the holidays and the Wynn had their lobby decked out for Christmas. They have a nice garden (INSIDE) that was full of lights and decorations. The Lake of Dreams looks AMAZING but I haven't had the chance to witness it in person. My favorite Vegas show is at the Wynn: Le Reve!   All in all you could easily spend 2 days seeing just the hotels on the strip. Pop into each one, browse around, take pics, maybe place a wager in the casino, get a bite, get a drink, then hop on over to the next one. I've done it all walking but there is also a shuttle that takes you up and down the strip.
5 What could I possibly say that hasn't already been said? The STRIP is THE place to be when in Vegas for all things fun! Walk around and enjoy all of the food, drink, music, shopping, shows, bright lights, incredible buildings, street entertainers, the Bellagio fountains, FANTASTIC people watching...all the while with a beer or cocktail in each hand of course!  The Strip offers all of the Sinful Goodness that makes Las Vegas what it is!  If you're looking for a quiet getaway...stay away! Vegas is not for you baby! Viva....vivaaa...Las Veeeeegaas!!!
5 Hm I'm not sure why I'm reviewing the strip, but I guess it's because I CAN ok so if you've never been to vegas before the strip is the main street where all the main hotels are, there are tons of restaurants and shops up and down the street, there is north strip and south strip, north has hotels like the venetian/palazzo etc.. and south is more mgm, luxor, and four seasons  it's usually hot as eff walking up and down the strip so be prepared for that, it's VERY packed and certain streets you can only cross by using a bridge so keep an eye out for that and don't get trapped and have to walk extra!   if you've never been to vegas before it's definitely fun checking out and seeing what's around but there really isn't anything too exciting to be honest, lots of weirdos walking around too
