5 First time at the new Gibson public library location and it is beautiful!   There's a computer room with about 20-30 computers to use.   Also they seem to have a lot more new books in. There's also a small area near the entrance to buy used books, magazines, VHS, CDs, etc. Ranging from 10 cents to $1! I always find hidden gems in the sale area.  I'm glad they have a new location, the old one just seemed a bit unsafe and unsanitary. This is place feels like a place I could stay for hours on end! :)   P.S. There's a drive thru window (not sure what it's for) and drop bin for returning books.
4 This is a really nice library that is part of the Henderson District.  It is about a year and a half old.  There is a section for children to play on the computers.  On the weekends, the kids section is full, but  has less traffic on the weekdays.  There are story times both during the week and on the weekends.  There are two study rooms that can be reserved in advance or asked for on the day if available.  The staff is helpful and willing to show you want you are looking for.  The drop off of books is a little high for a normal car.  The location is right off of Boulder Highway.
4 Lots of great books, little children's area to play in. Staff is helpful if you are looking for a particular book. The library offers classes for toddlers throughout the month. My toddler loves parachute playtime. Children's room is in a small room near the bathroom with no decorations or children's material up. If you are late the door is locked, yikes! Librarians are really sweet and personable with the toddlers. My daughter always wants to give them a hug when we leave. Great story time to go kits that are easy to access. Thanks for being such a great resource for the community.
4 Convenient location...drive through pickup/drop off is a plus.  Plenty of space to park.  Helpful staff.  Only thing that is lacking about this place is a coffee shop like the Paseo Verde library.
