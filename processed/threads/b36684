5 You have to call Cora. She is the absolute best hairstylist and artist. We love her.
5 Monet is absolutely the best! I'm a redhead with curly hair so I'm VERY particular about finding the right stylist who can get the color right and knows how to cut for curly hair. Monet not only listens to what I'm looking for but offers her input and expertise based on my needs. When I find a stylist I like, I stick with them and Monet is my girl!
5 Anyone that can make the train wreck on top of my head look good deserves a 5 star rating.  Cora is the best!
5 I had a blow out and make-up application done last month! It was so much fun and as other reviewers have stated Monet is the best! Very friendly. Will go back!!
