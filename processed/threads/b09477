1 It's extremely surprising there are no reviews on Yelp for this place! After reading horrid reviews on their scorpion infestation, I still decided to move in. Luckily I have not had any sitings yet.  But my review is not about that: It is absolutely disgusting how the pool grounds are cared for at the third pool.  Last night I went to go grill down at the third pool as was greeted by tons of bird droppings along with the pigeons hiding in the rafters of the gazebo.  Not only was that the problem but there was no light on the grill so u can't see anything. I basically left there feeling things crawl all over me.   I decided to go check out the second pool which oddly enough was much better although still dirty. Grilled there and that was that but my point is all the pool areas should be kept up the same. We all pay the same amount of money whether we live by the nice main pool or by the disgusting third pool.   Also, The fact I have to hangout with cockroaches if I want to use the Jacuzzi at night is disgusting!  This is a serious health issue with the bird droppings around place where people eat.  Pigeon problem needs to be handled, and grounds sprayed down of their droppings.  Update: I've lived here a month and my car just just broken into! How about investing in some cameras and way more lights for the dark grounds. How can I feel safe here?!?! Is it really that much to put two cameras up in your three parking areas?!?! It's about the safety of your residents. I mean you have cameras in the  front office to protect your things, what about the people who are making you money?! I doubt the management company knows what's going on. And if they do, them shame on them! ********************************************************************************************** Well, Its times to move out! Thank goodness! Overall, It wasn't that bad except for the scorpion issue! That was no fun! Talk about not feeling safe in your own house! Over the entire summer I found about 20 scorpions, they sprayed in the house and outside every week and we still had them in the bathroom and next to the fireplace. basically there's no solving this issue. Apparently it is hit or miss when it comes to apartments being infested with scorpions. So good luck!  However, for this place to not be accepting section 8 was a surprise as the amount of low life people that live here is amazing. I've had to call the police about 5 times to complain about the people who live below us...not just right below us either. I'm talking the entire bottom floor! and not kids, grown ass adults yelling and screaming in the hallways at all hours of the night.  The office does nothing. I suppose there's nothing really they can do but come on!  Everything I stated above is still accurate which is sad. you'd think they'd clean up the grounds.  Now added to all this I had leaks in my ceiling that were never fixed correctly and I am pretty sure they don't plan to. All I got to say is someone needs to come look at the condition of the buildings at the end of the complex! I didn't even want to have a fire in my fireplace in fear that a fire might start since i'm not sure of the condition of the roof (seeing as how it's leaking). Maybe that's me being dumb but shoot, that's the last thing I want to happen. I'll update you all on the move out process...  The only thing good is Sara at the front desk! She's the best person and she should be the manager since the real one doesn't do her job very well.
1 My husband and I lived here for almost 2 years.  We had issues before we even moved in.  We moved from another state and had set up the details of the apt before being able to see it.  The only request we had was to have a south-facing apt so we could continue to use our Direct TV.  Three weeks after finalizing the details of the apt we finally moved to Arizona and were able to move in.  The apt was not south-facing and when we had the Direct TV installer there, he couldn't do anything with the dish that would allow it to work at it's best.  okay...fine, we'll get out of our contract and get cable instead.   The 2nd day we were there, one of the employees started to enter our apt to show it...his reason, you ask?  Apparently no one had told him that we had moved in yet.  Well we paid 3 weeks before so once someone pays the rent/deposit then you should no longer be showing it, it belongs to the tenant!  Within the first 6 months we had one of our bikes stolen off the patio.  My husbands car was also broken into twice while living here.  A guy was also killed in one of the apts behind us.  Of course we tried to get out of there after a year...but we were saving up for a house.  When we renewed our lease they said we could only sign up for a 9 month lease because they were all out of 6 month leases.  Whatever!  Like that's a real thing.   When we moved out, we had professional cleaners come in and clean the entire apt...mainly because I didn't want to.  I'd rather put my effort into our new house.  We got our final invoice and have a charge for $86 to remove gum from a small area of carpet.  I explained to the manager that we don't chew gum nor did anyone else see this supposed gum (cleaners included).  I don't believe them one bit and I think they are just trying to get more money from hard working individuals.  One thing I'm glad about is I will never have to deal with this apt complex again nor will I mention it as a suitable place for people to live.   My advice...get out while you still can!
1 DO NOT MOVE TO THIS LOCATION.  My husband and I have lived there for 1.5 years now. We have had numerous bug and scorpion issues. In addition, if there is a change in the policy - the office will say that they handed out paper notifications, but you do not receive them. We were slammed with a late charge when they changed their direct payment information (without notification) and the office manager told me that I was snotty and rude. She has still not apologized! In addition, because of some complaining about noise at the pool, the entire pool and gym close at 10pm. If you are not out of the pool at 10pm, you face immediate eviction. They rate themselves as luxurious, but in all honesty, you can find better housing situations in Guadulpe.
