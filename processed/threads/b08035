3 3.5 stars to be exact. I've been coming to this Native New Yorker for as long as I can remember.  It is a great family restaurant and a fun place for happy hour or watching sports.  They have multiple t.v.'s on every wall. No matter where you sit, you have a view of some type of sports event. They are known for their wings, and well they should be.  Awhile back they used to have just plain teriyaki-flavored wings, but know they've kicked it up a notch with pineapple & teriyaki among other interesting flavors.  Besides the wings, they also have a full menu of sandwiches, pastas, pizza, salads and of course burgers.  My dad had a hot pastrami sandwich on our recent trip there, and he said it was the best one he has ever had.  I only give it 3.5 stars because although the menu has a variety of selections and the food is decent, it is all very predictable to me. Nothing really WOWs me with their food; but it's just above average for me to give it that 1/2 star.
2 My family has been spending B-day's at NNY for years, and I wish I could tell you why.  Maybe we're just creatures of habit, because I have been consistently disappointed with their food.  I'm a wing girl, and last nights dry, crusty wings did nothing for me.  The pizza was mediocre...I would have done better to stuff a frozen pizza in my purse and take bites when the waitress wasn't looking.  And I know the economy is bad, but they were doing some real nickel and dimeing.  5 of us ordered 50 wings, and it only came with 4 small cups of ranch.  So, it was a fight to decide who had to share.  Then someone had the brilliant idea to just ask for another cup of ranch.  The waitress warmly replied "there is an extra charge for that".  Oh well,  I guess it's my fault if I keep going back.
2 I met a friend here recently for lunch.  They had a good selection of lunch specials starting at $5.99.  Unfortunately, the entree that I ordered was not very hardy in the least.  I got Buffalo Sliders with curly fries.  The curly fries were good, but the sliders was sub-par.  Not only was there not much buffalo flavor, there really wasn't that much food.  I mean, I know sliders by nature are small, but it was almost as if I ordered mini-sliders!  I've been here many times over the years (including a memorable wing eating contest with a couple of friends where I ate 3 dozen...and wasn't in the top 3!) and the quality of food has really gone downhill as time has passed.    The service was ok, though I wasn't asked if I wanted my water to be refilled until we had been there for well over an hour.  I was also disappointed that they wouldn't accept my 'BOGOF' entertainment coupon because my entree wasn't from the regular menu.  The coupon certainly didn't qualify which entrees were eligible or not, and I wasn't feeling ornery enough to fight about the $6.    They probably deserve 2.5 stars rather than 2 stars, but I can't give halfs and since they have been on their downward trend for awhile, I figure I might as well give them the downward grade...
3 My bro & I requisitioned some calzonez at Native New Yowka for lunch yesterday. Mine was a veggie.  The thing was "A-Ok", but didn't quite have as much mozzarella as I would like in my crusty baked pockets o' cheese.   All in all, the Naive Nu Yowka is no comparison to a good calzone spot like Oregano's, Pizza Heaven or similar.
3 This review id for my most recent visit ONLY.   It was good but not great. I had the mini chicken hotwing sandwhich with blue cheese and Frys. 6 bucks I added the sprite because the water is shitty tasting.   The coworkers had, wings and chili cheesefrys and cheese bread. They seemed to enjoy the wings and the chili cheese frys were really good. Nice chili and cheese on cury frys.
3 Stopped in on Saturday for an early dinner. I walked right into a casual sports orientated restaurant. The setting made me feel relaxed. The decor looked as if the walls were of faux brink with pictures from new york splattered throughout the building. The lighting was dim, which made sports watching nice and comfy. The restaurant wasn't open, but ran into different rooms, and came with a couple of flat screen TVs per room. Which made it nice for different groups to be able to watch a couple of different games at the same time if needed.   When my husband and I walked in we were greeted by a super friendly hostess who right away sat us in a table. I noticed most of the wait staff seemed to be in their late twenties to mid thirties, and all were very friendly and welcoming. The workers really felt as if they were friends. I asked a few questions about how Sunday's are handled with what football games are shown.. They have the direct TV football package, so you can watch whatever game you want to if you show up early enough to reserve your teams game on the screen.   We checked out the menu and it wasn't anything glamorous, just bar type food. Sand witches, Burgers, Hot Wings, Steaks, you get the picture. Food ranges from $8-$15 a plate. My hubby and I ordered the Philly steak sandwiches with a side order of Hot Wings with the Strawberry sauce on it. We also ordered a couple of drafts. They had a good selection of drafts to choose from.   We waited and watched some college football, and our order showed up. The plate was huge, and the food was decent. Nothing spectacular, but OK food. The Hot Wings, I didn't care for the sauce, I probably would order a different kind, next time. The sauce didn't give me the heat I love in my wings. But the wings are cheap, like 55cents a piece and you can mix up different types if you like.   We had a 1/2 off meal coupon from the entertainment guide so with 3 22oz drafts, and two meals with 5 hot wings our meal was about $35 with tip. So a very good bargin. I'll be back, the service is amazing, and the beer is nice and cold.
3 Not bad, but not great either.  My friends like to go here to meet and hang out... and yeah, I'll be back.  It's pretty much middle of the road.  I have other joints like this I'd rather go to first.  I like the wings, I like some of the other stuff... their kitchen takes FOREVER though.  It's like, did you have to kill the chickens first???  The service is friendly although they tend to be a bit slow in refills of soda or water, but real quick to refill your beer.
1 I am have been coming to native new Yorker since they opened but today the food/wings/service we're horrible the wings there we're so tiny as if the killed a baby chicken the bones were so brittle that it jammed in the side of my mouth the waitress never came back for any refills and to top things off they were not busy.. I am so disappointed with location I specifically requested fresh wings avoid this location 1 star for crappy day here...
3 Severely overpriced for what you get.  However, the wings are pretty damn tasty.
3 I've never been here for dinner or a meal or anything like that, but I have been here a few times for karaoke.   The first time I went, it was a little hard to see form the road as the sign was dim but I made it. The place is clean and the staff is nice. They stay on top of the bill and last time split checks with ease :)  No matter how packed the place gets they're always there to make sure your glass stays full.   When I was DD, I was never charged for my soda or water.. or if I was, someone else put it on theirs.  The karaoke runs fairly smoothly, but the selection of songs is pretty lacking, at least for my taste.
5 Gotta love the wings! We are regulars and love the staff!
4 Best chicken wings in town!
4 Good food, great prices on wings on Tuesdays. 12 wings for 4 bucks!
4 I love their wings, the pizza is ok, they do have an ok amount of TVs to watch & have little sound boxes you can put on your table so you can hear the TV (assuming the music isn't blaring). Not our favorite sports bar place but we stop in every once in a while.
4 I always enjoy the food here. The wings are good! I like the skin has that crisp to it.  They serve Blue Moon by the pitcher which is rad when with a group (or alone haha)  The food really is excellent. I used to know a bartender here he was cool.  I would have it 5 stars BUT some of the waitresses are idiots and seem to mess up every single thing you order.  They always correct it for free but it is annoying!
4 Service was good, this location is the best spot to eat in the area next to Santisi Brothers since the entire strip mall area isn't doing well.  I love the honey bbq wings they sell here (pretty much live for them when I go here).  I had the pizza this weekend and it was OK, my wife ordered bruchetta but it looked more like a tortilla with canned tomato on it (didn't taste very good).  The atmosphere is really nice here too, I like Native New Yorker and like to stop in every few months.  Also is a great place to watch a sporting event.
4 I come to Native most often for Happy Hour, and the wings are what keep me coming back.  I most recently tried to pineapple teriyaki, but the honey hot bbq are my favorite.  My only complaint is on Fridays more often than not I'm left with an empty beer glass and need to actively hunt down a server for another, and that doesn't bode well for washing down all those wings.  I've come on other days during the week and haven't had that problem.  Maybe the bar could use another server or 2 on peak days/hours.  That's the only thing keeping them from a 5 star review....
1 If I could give no stars I would--went here last December for a friend's birthday.  While sitting in the bar, a cockroach climbed up the wall behind her.  I alerted the waiter who ran in back and disappeared for at least 5 minutes.  In the meantime, another patron still wearing a full suit from his work day had to kill the cockroach.  Reported it to the state who went out and determined they should get rated a gold star!  Disgusting, I have not and will not return. If there are cockroaches in December, just imagine how many there are in the July heat!
1 Hadn't been here in a while and met two friends for Happy Hour last night.  Food was awful!!  I've never seen DICED onion scattered all over a combination pizza.  Probably frozen from a bag.  At 65 cents each, the wings were the smallest, all tip sections, no or very few drummettes.  The 15 "traditional" wings have no sauce, just over-fried, forgotten in the fryer.  Not "the best of Phoenix classics" as the menu says.  And they certainly wouldn't have been worth even the 39 cent Tuesday and Thursday special price.   After asking for ranch dressing when we ordered, all we got were 4 tiny cups to go with 30 wings and 3 people!   This wasn't the Native New Yorker food that I remember from a year ago and I won't be going back.
1 Went for lunch. Took over 30 min for food to arrive. Ordered chef salad. Made with processed turkey and ham. Also with processed cheese slices. childs choc milk was not mixed up. Kraft mac & cheese on kids menu.  Won't come back again.
3 I went here the other night with some friends who are regulars for karaoke. The place had some great drink specials (3$ long islands...that were actually good, 2$ sex on the beach shots, cheap beers). We had some boneless wings, which were alright but not very spicy...tried both the medium and the bbq hot and both were mild. The service was fine and the karaoke was also pretty good, but it wouldn't be my first choice for a place to eat.
2 Arrived here with family mainly  to satiate my desire for wings as  in the past I've had ok-good experiences with their suicide wings, E.G., three different locations seemed to have differing levels of heat.    Was in Sat night, early evening. Wings didn't exactly themselves-it to the table and after 2-3 had pretty much come to the conclusion that they'd sat a while, had already been heated more than once or the oil was getting pretty fricking old..They also were not exactly  physically hot.  On floor manager seemed to take a while to register that I thought some, or all, of those had happened and , since they were suicides they had no return so I thought I'll eat them anyway ( sauce covering some of the sins of the cook)   They took em away , they reappeared really quickly (like 1/5 the time the original order took and now had so much hotsauce on them some of the wings were actually submerged ( that if meant to teach me anything was appreciated..I love heat:D    I'm pretty sure they just fired these again   My entree , never get this. Buffalo fish sliders appeared with a scratch of the sauce/ cabbage, some oil, same crap just tasted of oil , so I used some of their hotsauce to kill that too.    The kid's meal was  good and while the wife's was a pretty watery chicken pot pie it tasted good. Service was as slow from the kitchen has others suggested  and  while I would usually  do 2.5 rounded up to  3... I'm going to round down to 2.. If you pride yourself on  wings and then let anorexic, cold and oily items substitute for them then I will trade the nicer booths, wider drink choice to head to Steakenburger because their wings truly do not suck.
3 They have a nice  2 for $20 menu with a shared appetizer and two main courses. The bacon and cheese flatbread is delicious and addictive. My burger was just right but the fries tasted as if they been reheated. My date enjoyed his chicken strips but was not impressed with the fries either. Karoke happens on Friday and lets just say it was interesting to say the least. All in all it was ok.
3 Good atmosphere. Decent food. This place needs a better rating.
2 We got in line, gave our name, then MANY people who came after us were seated before us. Fuck me right?   We like the wings, the rest of the food was meh.  Took a good fifteen minutes from when we got the bill to when we could sign it and leave, we were even right next to the register.
4 Love wings? Then this is the place for you on Tuesday and Thursday nights. Normally the wings are .69 but in these two days they are only .49! I also love that there are 15 different flavors and you can order as many of each as you like. So if you want to try just 3 of several kinds of wings you can. I go mainly for the wings but the appetizers are also great. Several friends and family have had several non-wing items and they have always enjoyed their choices. Enjoy!
3 The bartenders and management are great! Food is reasonably priced and you get a ton of it. I would steer clear of the karaoke on Saturday night.....the music is good but the folks that think they can sing are rough to listen to. I have had great service every other time we have been there and the staff tries to make that personal connection and recognize you by name! Kudos on that! Everyone likes to be recognized. The fish fry on Fridays is great too!
2 Shockingly disappointing! Tipped the bartender 20% on our to go meal and waited FOREVER! I kept thinking it's because I ordered a pizza and they were making it fresh. However, the pizza was cold when I got home and I'm only 4 miles away! To top it off, she didn't give us any silverware to eat our cookie sundae dessert, no crushed red pepper for the pizza, AND no napkins at all! Did I mention we had a dozen wings?!?! No napkins???? Yikes. Talk about poor service. I should've tipped the cooks cuz the bartender didn't do anything for me other than bring me a water and then she forgot about my order! I waited over 40 minutes. Ridiculous. The bartender should've asked me if I needed napkins, silverware, etc, if she didn't plan on automatically including it.  Truly disappointing visit tonight and you can't blame it on the place being busy. It was 1015pm on a Tuesday night and there were only a few tables.  Native Newyorker food is always great, but not when it's cold. Take my advice- Don't order to go. The food would probably arrive sooner, still be hot, and you'd certainly have napkins if you ate at a table.
2 I am from NYC and have been in Phoenix for a few months! This Native NY'er is within walking distance from my hotel. I've been going their for about two months on Friday and Saturday nights for food, drinks and the karaoke. The food was OK, the drinks specials were good and the service was also good. The problem is that when a confrontation erupted at the bar the staff did not respond quilckly to notify the police. So, I ended up geting injured and when I asked them to call the police the did not, I had to. And after the episode they said they hoped It would not affect me not coming back again! Not even a comp or something! Just an I'm sorry what happened! I will not be returning at all. I looked over my nine charges on my statements and seen I had spent over $300 their. There loss!
4 Wings, Wings, Wings, and more Wings!  I have always been a fan of Native on Bell and am disappointed to see so many low star reviews.  The wings have never let me down and the beer is always cold.  Happy hour is the best time to enjoy discounted drinks and if you dine in on Tuesday enjoy discounted wings as well.  Sunday boasts the NFL ticket with many nice TVs to view your favorite team.   It would be nice to see it go back to the Bills bar that it used to be.  Keep staying strong Native on Bell!
2 Five of my friends and I stopped at Native last night for Happy Hour. We were trying to keep an open mind about our visit at first.  Our server was young and seemed a little inexperienced for the amount of tables she had. She wasn't very friendly...didn't add to the experience.  When were first came in we asked her what was in one of their signature drinks, she had no clue nor did she ask anyone. After we all ordered and she was gone we found it in another menu...oh, that sounds good. I probably would have got that.  Oh well, first strike.  Most of us were not that hungry so really we should have been a pretty low maintenance table. We ask for second round, chips and salsa and some wings.  She comes back five min later with the wrong drink.  Comes back with a new one Stella on tap. Still no chips and salsa. We are watching our buddys beer and the "head" on this thing keeps growing and growing. We were making fun of it. Our other buddy orders his second Stella same thing, they said it tasted weird. I make a joke to the waitress about their strange beer and she says "yea, well no one ever orders that so..." "So, what I say, they have old chunky beer?" She disappears again.  We are going on 30 min here...still no wings...still no chips and salsa. Were snag her in passive and asked about the wings. You could tell by her face she never put the order in.  We talked to a manager who seemed pretty uninterested in talking with us. Of coarse the comp'd items off the bill which we didn't even care. We just wanted to feel like they actually cared about the service we received, they did not.  Me giving a 2 rather than a one is simply out of kindness... We saw that the management set our waitress up for failure, so I took it easy. They really earned a 1.
2 Stopped in for dinner on a Thurs night. Place was very slow and quiet.  The only thing I really thought was good were the wings. I ordered the Mom's Special spaqet and meatballs. Pasta overcooked with water at the base of the bowl. Sauce was dried out and too chunky. My brothers lazagna was so so. He got his salad for his app but my soup never came. Didn't realize that till the next day lol. Oh well. Won't go back here for almost $40 tab with tip. Girl was nice and seemed experienced.
5 I love this place so much.  Me and my friends hang out here every Tuesday.  We eat wings and relax.  Best thing is, they let us use our electronic cigarettes in the restaurant.  The staff is amazing.  They know us by name and treat us like friends.  Thanks for the good times.
2 The service was great, the entertainment was great (Karaoke), but the 2 stars of 5 is because my friend got food poisoning there and was throwing up for 2 days and could not eat or hold anything down sadly.  I hope they improve on all food handling practices and dispose of any old, spoiled food and not serve it.  I told my friend to get things that rotate more often such as wings or pizza next time.  She does not want to eat there ever again.
2 I recently had drinks and food with friends here. The service was awful! It took over 40 minutes to get my 2nd drink. In addition, they forgot two food orders. When I spoke with the manager he offered to take the items off my bill. I told him I will pay for the items I got. I was so frustrated because I just wanted him to listen to my complaint and he only kept throwing out excuses.
1 My wife and I always heard good things about this place.  We were wanting to go to Tagliani's, but thought we should try Native New Yorker for once, to see what the hype was about.  We were sat quickly and the lady seemed pretty nice.  Unfortunately she rushed us through our decisions and never offered any helpful options or features/benefits.  Happy hour lists appetizers being half off, but that's only some of them, and conveniently, the three I was considering were those.  I understand there are small prints on deals at times so that could easily be overlooked.    The buffalo chicken dip appetizer we ordered was really good, but only worth $4 maybe $5 size-wise and could have been a lot better without the chunks of chicken.    My wife ordered the veggie calzone with pepperoncinis and mushrooms.  When this came out we were both impressed with the size, but the bread didn't have much flavor.  Along with this, recotta cheese was a very "strange" cheese to include being that its so grainy and overpowering.  It ruined the calzone for me altogether.    I ordered 18 wings on the bone.  6 suicide, 6 hot, and 6 pineapple teriyaki.  The wings had a good amount of chicken, more than any other restaurant, but the sauces ruined it for me again.  I can handle a lot of heat so my opinion may differ from others.  The suicide sauce wasn't very hot, but there were so many red pepper seeds everywhere and they were actually pretty gross, unless doused in ranch.  I felt they tried so hard to make them hot, they ignored the taste factor altogether.  The hot wings were very good and decently spicy.  The pineapple teriyaki wings were ok, but seemed almost soggy because of possibly soaking the wings in the sauce for hours, absolutely doused.  I'm not sure which wings caused it, and I NEVER get heartburn, but I did here.    While we were waiting for the bill, we realized our server was the only serving the entire restaurant.  I understand this isn't her fault, but the restaurants.  The bill finally came, she had overcharged us for the calzone.  All minimal things that could be overlooked, but so many that it ruined the entire experience.    With waters and those meals the total was $30.20.  I tipped $5 and got the hell out of there.  Should have gone to Tagliani's.  I took the extra food home, not to waste, but it just sat there in fear of heartburn again.  If you go for drink and wings, I imagine it could be somewhat of an enjoyable scene being the bar top tables are all close and near the bar and there are tv's everywhere.    I would have given 2 stars, but my stomach hurts now.
5 Plenty of good things to say about the staff, the food, and the service, but one area deserves special recognition. I've been coming on Sundays to watch football for over 15 years and I honestly can't remember EVER finding the restrooms dirty. They are ALWAYS clean. That's a tough feat for any restaurant, but with a full bar during NFL games?!....way to go guys!
5 My all time favorite food is wings and I have eaten them at just about every pizza joint in the valley so to claim this as a 5 star is saying something.  The wings are always cooked to perfection. They even accommodate all requests and since I am  very particulat about how I like my wings that says a lot. I recommend NNY to all friends and family so I can go as often as possible.
4 My wife & I  have been coming here for years.  We've come for Karaoke, to meet friends, bring the family, to enjoy a game on TV, for lunch and dinner ad enjoy a game on TV.  I think their wings are some of the best in town. If you want great tasting  NNY is the place to go.   the service here is always good. The food is always hot, fresh and fairly fast even when their busy. It's great for families, meetings or just to hang out.  FOOD: Always good. SERVICE: Professional & attentive. PRICE: The prices are compatible to places like Gallagher's ,Santisi Brothers Pizzeria and Sports Grill, Applebee's  or others like them in the area. CONCLUSION: Relaxed atmosphere where you can have a relaxed meal and spend some time doing it. RETURN FACTOR 100%.         ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ******************** 5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH
2 When exactly did this place start sucking?  I can remember seeing it as a destination back in the 90's. Even through the first part of the 2000's it was old reliable.  Now, wings battered and bland (they DON'T batter them in NEW YORK!), pizza so-so, service so hit-or-miss that at times I feel like serving my own table.   What the hell happened?
2 ***Customer service is critical to the success for any restaurant***  I come to this restaurant for lunch to order some buffalo wings.  I've only been to this reseaurant once previously and had buffalo wings there and they were pretty good so I thought I would give it another shot.    I am on a low carb diet at the time so I cannot have breaded wings.  When I got my order, I recieved breaded wings.  I told my waitress that I didn't want breaded wings and I had non-breaded wings from here once.  Her reply was "you have to tell me that because all of our wings are breaded here".  Instead of offering to take the wings back and correct the order I had to tell her that.  She just stood there in silence thinking I was going to accept these breaded wings.  When I mentioned about replacing the wings she replied, "its going to take a while".  I wasn't going to say anything but I am spending my money here and I should be treated with respect.    I went to the bar area and asked to speak with the manager on duty. I told him what had happened and he did take action.  The manager said it was not true and it only takes 8 minutes to cook.  When she came back, she seemed pissed and offered me another drink.  Although I didn't want another drink, she snatched up the drink while I was trying to tell her I didn't want another one.  My wings arrived as order and they were good as they were the last time.  Because of the quality of the food and how the manager responded,  I did not give this restaurant a 1 star.     To top it off, before I left she took it upon herself to explain to me what happened.  I have nearly 20 years of customer service.  If you make an error, you don't argue with your customer.  Just apologize for the error and offer to fix it.  It was her fault that she failed to ask how I wanted the wings.  I don't think it was necessary for her to come at my table to continue to go on about it.  If you are going to work in the service industry, you will have to grow a thick skin and not let little things irritate you such as a communication error as this one.
2 Some friends took us here to eat.  Everything was OK.   The pepperoni pizza was average.  There was not very much pepperoni.  The hot wings were nothing special but the honey wings were very good.  Service and atmosphere was good.
1 1988 called, they want their old ass, outdated, cheap garbage pretend brick sheet paneling and pathetic NY Plastic covered art work that wouldn't look good in a garage back.   Seriously. This place is dark. Musty. STILL Smells from when smoking inside was legal. The exterior is worn. The landscape is tired and needs help. Theres NOTHING inviting about the exterior of this restaurant at all. The interior is WORSE. Deep fried breaded wings that turn to mush. Yummmmm.. (I think I just threw up a little in my mouth)  The owner needs to wake up. The hey day of NNY is OVER.   DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE. Travel another 500 feet to Santisi brothers in the same parking lot by the sticky floor cinemas and walk into a place with like 400 TVs all streaming everything you could imagine. Cute friendly waitresses. GREAT food. NON breaded wings. And NO. I dont work for Santisi. Its just a much better place. Seriously. Its actually what NNY wishes it was.
1 Here for the 35 cent wings and now I remember why I stopped coming here.  Extremely slow service, tiny teeny itty bitty wings & flat beer.  Got here at 7:30 and barely leaving at 9p due to the ridiculous wait time.
4 First time at this location.  The bartender, Alicia (spelling?) Was very prompt and a total sweetheart.  I am a wing fanatic so i had wings and a beer.  Salt and pepper wings-yummy, strawberry hot wings-yummy, asiago wings-yummmmmmmy!  I didn't care for the asian style wings though. And the wings were on the very small size but they were tasty and the friendliness of the staff and customers will bring me back! Thanks for a great first time experience
1 The Tatum and Bell location is run by a rude arrogant GM that has no respect for his employees or the fact that they have bills. They dump thousand of dollars of food everyday in the garbage or the managers eat it in front of employees that make 7.90$ an hour. The GM dictates who can pay their rent or not or who gets kicked out on the street because there full time job was just eliminated because the GM is a dirt bag and has NO marketing or advertising experience. On the opening weekend this guy held all the food in the kitchen because he wanted every dish to go out at the same time..once the food arrived at the tables it was nasty cold. People were leaving. The GM talks behind the employees back than two facing them the next day. The wings are not wings they are drummets saturated with breading. The GM one day insulted the new line cooks in front of Corporate employees visiting the restaurant, humiliating them. When asked if he can run the line he will boast about how he washed dishes before he became a manager. There is NOTHING NY about native NY. New York food does not taste like that people or is frozen including the bread. Don't eat there don't work there. They will work you for 7.90$ an hour and use every sorry ass excuse to say your not worth anymore. If you're in the community of Tatum and Bell do not let your children or family work there and tell your neighbors to stay away.
1 Tonight waited about 30 minutes to get the attention of the bartender to get an order placed.  She replied that I didnt ask her for anything.   Wow!  I thought it was your job to check on me?  I was not offered a menu when I got there.  She blamed it on being short and me not asking for something, stating she thought I was just there to hang out..   Finally had my wings tossed to me IN A BOX!  No napkins or plate for the bones.  She finally came back around asking if I needed anything and I had to explain Lonnie had given me napkins and a plate.  She said she ASSUMED I wanted it to go.  REALLY??? I had just ordered an adult beverage!  It will be a LONG time (if ever) that I go back and I have been going for 10 years.
4 Stopped by for lunch last Sunday while in town. I ordered 20 wings medium and wife had Club Sandwich. The wings were pretty hot for medium, way hotter than the menu let on. But, even though hotter then I would like, the wings were really good (the chicken part of the wing vs the sauce). Wife said the Club was "Just OK". Had a side order of Tater Tots which were pretty good. Next time will try the salt-n-pepper
