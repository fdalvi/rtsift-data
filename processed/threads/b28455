2 Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Garage shoes really aren't good. There's nothing wrong with getting bargain shoes but it's not really a bargain if they fall apart after one outing like most of the shoes here.  I guess you could find the odd pair that might be diamonds in the rough but it's not an easy task. Nothing in this store is particularly inviting either, not the overpowering lighting, the blaring dance music and certainly not the shoes.  I guess you could be lucky and find something nice in here but most of the items look very cheap indeed.
3 Getting shoes from the Garage makes me do the "S" MSN face. You know, the one that makes your mouth squiggle in a disapproving manner!  Stilettos, sandals and slip ons are all very cheap in here - but a bit cheaply made. There's a very tacky sheen that shines through this place - it's all strip lighting, mirrored walls and an array of shoes that look like they'll cave in within the first week of wear.  They have improved marginally over the past couple of years, hence the three stars. But The Garage is still pretty trashy, and shamelessly so. If you have a shred of common sense you'll be able to see that for yourself!
3 I really shouldn't like this shop, but I can't help myself. The shoes are never made of real leather, they hardly ever have the right sizes in stock and the staff are definitely less than welcoming.  But, on the rare occasions that they do have your size in stock this is often just the place where you find that specific pair of shoes you're looking for. Granted, they're not great quality, but at roughly Â£20 per pair it doesn't really matter if they only last half a dozen wearings!  I also love the fact that their heels are sky high. I'm a high heel junkie, and the way I see it if you're going to wear heels then you may as well wear decent-sized ones, and this place never disappoints on that front.
