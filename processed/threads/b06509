5 this little place was great! fun day with great jet skis...the older couple is extremely nice and made for an affordable fun time at the lake. I would highly recommend giving these guys a chance! they have the trailer hitch if you need and include many sized life jackets.
5 The owners Chris and joe were extremely nice. They took my reservation without a credit card. I rented two decent wave runners for $125 each for the whole day. $300 deposit on each. Brought them back at 5.30 in the same condition I picks them up. TheY threw in the life jackets and a hitch and trailer for the skis. This really is the best deal in town and 33 minute drive to the lake. Awesome day on the lake
5 Best of the best. Awesome prices. Great running skis. Super Duper friendly as can be. Very nice, down to earth people.  Life jackets, trailer, anchor, ties...everything you need supplied.  I'll definitely be back. Maybe rent one of their boats.  I can't say enough good things about this company...
