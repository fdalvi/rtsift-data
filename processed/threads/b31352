5 This shop is amazing, has a fantastic atmosphere, and has a lot of cool vibes. I love the live music there during fringe festival, and I also love the people that are there. There are some real characters that make this place a real original unique spot to check out, and I love the charities they support as well, so I know it is all going to a good cause, and they really are making a difference in the community. You can find live spoken word, interesting workshops, live music performances, african drums, drum circles, unique art, jewelry, eastern tapestries, various beautiful textiles, pottery, and also fantastic people that make you want to visit the shop all the time. You can get a cup of tea as well, and also find someone to talk to, as I notice that this is a place for anyone to visit even if you don't intend on buying anything. This is definitely 10 stars, but I can only give it 5.
