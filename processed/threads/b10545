5 Flautas are a must have.....mmmmm good. Nice people Great food... that's a winning combo!
5 Los Antojos just got a killer review by John Curtas:  eatinglasvegas.com  http://www.eatinglv.com/2009/07/los-antojos/  Congratulations!   This is actually it's 2nd great article in a couple of weeks -- the first as a shout out from Alex Stratta in Las Vegas Weekly.  If only all the great mom & pop places in Vegas/Henderson, could get their 15 minutes --   oh right, that's what Yelp's supposed to be...but all you bozos keep writing about are the big strip joints to get your review counts up.  And the rest have covered In n Out enough to last an eternity.   Oh, and don't forget the myriad of idiots who order wrong at Lotus, then trash it.  Seriously, you think we can't tell...?!  Please, people.  Broaden your horizons.  There are great gems still waiting to be discovered.
5 Alambre...I'm officially a convert.    Consomme loco...crazy good.  Quesadillas con rajas...rethink quesadillas...these are the real thing.  Verde salsa...all other places should be green with envy.  Mama in the cocina...you're the cutest, nicest Mom -- as Mom & Pops go, that I've ever met in Las Vegas.    And your sweet neighbor a coupla doors down that sells raspados -- definitely cool...  Can't wait to come back.    Cash only.
5 After hearing about this place on KNPR I decided to come down, with my best Mexican friend in tote (just in case I needed translation on the menu), to try this place out.  I do not recommend using Google maps to locate this place, instead look out for it on the southeast corner of Sahara and Eastern.  Upon arriving, it does not look like much, and at first glace I thought I had arrived upon a venue that did not sell food at all, but after reading the words "taco" and "enchilada" written on the glass window, I breathed a sigh of relief.  We entered and saw the crammed 9 table (plus bar top seating on the side) seating area with a counter top right behind.  After trying my best to decipher the Spanish on the menu (with the help of my friend), I settled on the chicken mole enchilada (~$8) and the tortilla sopa (~$5).  My friend, who had also brought her roommate, got the milanesa (~$10) and the chicken flautas (~$8).  After ordering we sat at one of the tables stuffed in the corner to await our meal.  On the table was an open container with what appeared to be some type of hot sauce, typical of Mexico City style fare, according to my friend.  Our meal arrived complete with rice, beans, and a few tortilla chips right on the plate.  My mole, which can be explained as a curry-like sauce containing chocolate, was rich, sweet and savory.  I tried some of the flautas, topped with lettuce, tomato, sour cream, and queso.  Crispy on the outside with soft, juicy chicken on the inside.  The milanesa, according to my friend was good too.  The tortilla sopa was savory and sour from the lime and sour cream.  Definitely a must try.  The questionable sauce in the open dish was, in-fact, hot sauce, chipotle hot sauce to be exact.   All in all I gave this place 5 stars because the price is decent, the food is good, and the staff is friendly.  I will definitely come here again, possibly to try out the other goodies on the menu.  I recommend this place to anyone who is adventurous and loves good Mexican food at decent prices.  This is not a place for those who are expecting a fine-dining, or even a Chili's-style dining experience, nor the obsessive compulsive clean.  **CASH ONLY**
4 Stopped by to cure my hangover hunger :) on a Sunday afternoon. I live in the area  but never been to this hole-in-the-wall yet so I was kind of intrigued after seeing review about this place in LV Weekly.  Ordered few tacos and sope and quesadilla. All was good but I'd like to come back and try more stuff to see what's the hype.  It should be all good because place was packed (although it is very small  inside).
4 This tiny storefront restaurant has received a measure of notoriety since an article appeared in the Las Vegas Weekly indentifying it as celebrity Chef Alex Stratta's favorite restaurant for authentic Mexico City cuisine.  Alex was dining elsewhere this day, but the restaurant was fairly busy.  Orders are placed at the counter and then while waiting for the food you can munch on not so authentic taco chips served with two homemade salsas, tomatillo and chipotle.  We each ordered a bowl of consommé loco, a rich chicken broth with shredded chicken, avocado and fresh cilantro that were accompanied by a pair of fresh corn tortillas - muy bueno!  A week later we returned for lunch and again enjoyed the consomme loco.
3 Imagine a dinky, but very authentic place that actually has little Mexican women running around the kitchen making small, but tasty dishes that aren't easily found anywhere else in Vegas.  Great, right? Yes, but...  This place is dinky, and no money was spent on the seating, at all. There's limited beverage choices. The portions are not going to individually make anyone fat. And the ambiance is, well, you waste no time getting right to your meal and concentrating on your meal.  The plus is that the mole' is fan-frigging-tastic. The tacos ( while small ) are spicey and chock-full of zesty flavor. The beans are freshly made and have never even seen a can. And there is a great smell wafting from the kitchen and blanketing the place.  Definitely worth venturing into for authentic Mexican cuisine if you can put up withthe other elements of Mexican culture- the bull-riding on TV, the rickety, cheap furnishings, etc. etc. No date night glamour here, but a good foodie adventure for the gringo's nonetheless.  Being bi-linqual, or having a translator is a definite plus. Or just point and mumble if you don't speak Spanish. They'll get the point. And they're pretty cool about it, too.  Also- best mole sauce in town so far. Make it 3 and 1/2 stars!
2 I heard about this place on Yelp Talk Vegas and thought I'd give it a try for lunch today.  It's located in an older, ethnic area of Vegas that has a large Hispanic population, so I thought I was on the right track.  I was excited as I pulled into the parking lot.  I couldn't wait to get inside and try it out.  The restaurant is small with about 4 tables for 16 people and counter seating for another 8-10 people.  It sounds like a lot, but it's crammed into a small area where chairs are back to back....very tight space.  The menu is pretty extensive, but I found it shocking that they don't have Burritos on the menu......WHAT??!!!  One of my favorite dishes and they don't have it.....oh well, I didn't give them a strike for that.  I saw that they had the bottled Mexican Orange Soda that I L-O-V-E, so I bought a bottle with the meal.  I opted for an Asada Torta & a Cheese Quesadilla (it sounds redundant & I hate saying it, but that's what was on menu).....thought I'd try two items because I was hungry and I wanted to get a good feel for their food.  The tables have the standard Mexican Red & Green Salsa on the table for your convenience....homemade, which is a plus.  When the food came out, I was kind of disappointed with the size of the Torta, but it's about quality not quantity, so I won't dock them for that.  They also brought out a small bowl of pickled peppers, almost like Italian Giardiniera peppers....cool, I love those.  However, the Asada was very tough and bland....Strike 1.  It was pretty flavorless....so I had to add a lot of the pickled peppers & hot sauce to make it palatable....Strike 2.  When they brought out the Quesadilla I was surprised to see that it was deep fried and looked like an Empanada (see pics).....looked better than it tasted though.  It too was bland!  Wow!  I couldn't believe it.....so again, I doused it with hot sauce and finished it because I was starving....Strike 3.  I really really really wanted to like this place, but the food was just too bland.....I tried 2 items and it was a bust.  Damn, that's too bad.  Will I come back?  I'm torn....maybe to try the Tacos and give them a chance for redemption.
5 I love this place!  The employees are always really nice and the food is amazing!  The chicken soup tastes like something grandma would make.  The enchiladas are rich and delicious.  The flan--homemade and everything flan should be.  Everything on the menu is awesome!  Great prices, but it's cash only.
3 This a great find if you are looking for more traditional Mexican food styled more like the food in Mexico city. Sorry suckas, you're gonna have to step out of your burrito bubble and order something else!  We tried the consommé loco which is a chicken soup. It was very simple, some people might say bland, but I can imagine craving it when I am sick and would like a simple chicken soup without all that extra tortilla soup stuff. It's just shredded chicken, rice, and a few vegetables. Overall tasty and ok for the $6 price.   I also ordered the alambre which I have eaten elsewhere before. It was ok but I think I could have spent my $9 on something else on the menu. The deep fried quesadillas and raspados looked great so that might be a good option.  I nabbed half a chicken mole taco and was delighted. Great flavor, maybe a bit too much sauce...but hey if you want moist saucy mole tacos this is the place!   If you are in the area, stop by and try it out. A small place but the menu is pretty big. If you are looking for something like Roberto's this is not the place; much more authentic dishes served in a sit down setting. Maybe one day they will replace the elementary school chairs and tables, but for now...
4 i would give this place 5 stars if they would spend some extra money to fix it up. not much eye appeal but very clean. it was rated one of the best hidden places in vegas by npr critics.  the food is amazing at take out prices. oh and they didnt accept cards a few months ago so check before you go
5 Awesome...authentic street food. Pazole took me back!!!
5 I think it's hilarious that someone would knock off an entire star for this place not having burritos. What we in the U.S. call "burritos" doesn't even exist in Mexico. That's an absurd Americanized thing.  That being said, I'll get on with the review, starting with the disclaimer that  THIS PLACE DOES NOT SELL MEXICAN-AMERICAN food.  People that are expecting nachos and burritos--sorry. Go to Taco Bell.  This place sells LEGIT, MEXICAN food that you would only otherwise find in MEXICO CITY, MEXICO. Phew. Okay, there.   AND, it's some of the best food I've had outside of Mexico City, to boot.  I haven't found any other place where I can order tortilla soup and get authentic tortilla soup. And where else would I be able to find mole verde?! MOLE VERDE. There is a huge variety of amazing food on the menu. I also saw them (WITH MY OWN EYES) start to make the food only after I had ordered it. I made awesome conversation with the woman who owns the place; sooo friendly, so chatty, always asking if we needed anything else. And at the end of the experience everything was fairly and moderately priced. To be honest, the food was so delicious that I would've paid double what I paid for that tortilla soup.   I WILL RECOGNIZE that the interior of the place isn't exactly charming. It's a little run down, with that faint layer of grease that usually coats well used restaurants. It's small and the tables are surprisingly close to the ground -- Buuuuuut I couldn't care less. The food makes up for anything that might be aesthetically displeasing as far as seating goes.   Try this place out. I could rave and rave about it. For days. That's what I'm doing now.   :]
4 We made a return visit for bowls of loco consommé, a delicious chicken rice soup with cilantro and avocado.  The soup is low fat and loaded with shredded chicken, avocado and cilantro.
4 I suggest the Consome Loco!
5 I love this place. This place is a real hidden gem in Las Vegas, it's my go to spot for an authentic Mexican meal. The entire menu is outstanding and very affordable. The people are great, very comfortable, homely atmosphere, very welcoming. Soups, tacos, gorditas, huarache, tortas, flan....everything here is great. Highly recommended.  Everything that I've had here has been great but so far my favorite bites have been the enchiladas Pollo De Mole and consomme loco.  The enchiladas pack a punch of flavor with the mole and the consomme loco is just a great example of less is more.
4 Finally! Mexican food with SOUL.....with 2 strikes(Casa Don Juan, and Las Islitas) I guess third time's the charm...  Los Antojos does Mexican food typical of Mexico City and they do it pretty good! Inside is very modest with simple tables and chairs and pictures and signs of different dishes they offer. Sorry, you won't find Quesadillas that the general American public is familiar with, nor will you find Burritos here....you have been warned.  We ordered some Tacos-Tripa, Lengua, Suadero, Cochinita Pivil, and Mole de Pollo. We also got the Consomme Loco, Quesadilla de Rajas and a Huarache de Asada. I also got an Horchata-Homemade, not from the machine/instant.  All of the tacos were good, but the standout was the chicken mole, just like mole should taste. The Consomme Loco is a perfect example of simple food done right, DO get this if you ever dine here! Our first spoonful of this soup, the lady behind our counter saw our smiles and said "Como Su Casa"("Just like home") It did feel as if we were guests in her home as she and her husband always checked on us to see that everything was okay. The Quesadilla was different in a good way...deep fried masa stuffed with cheese and strips of poblano peppers with a crisp exterior. The Huarache was good, but the carne asada was a little tough. We shared a cup of Strawberries and Cream and a Peach Gelatina for dessert. Overall, a good dinner, and definitely worthy of a return visit. You never know if you'll run into Chef Alex Stratta-Yup, this is his spot for Mexican fare....ALOHA!!!
5 This place is the business! best MEXICAN  restaurant on the east side!!! although i don't ever dine in (just because it so small, and a place like this you wanna take your time and savor every bite!.....that great!....and i don't want people giving me the evil over  over a table). Its so worth it. I recommend the Hurache and Alambres but everything on the menu is great thats just my personal FAVORITE.
5 I have only been here twice, but so far it is the best Mexican fare I've had in Las Vegas.  They had a good chicken mole taco, a satisfying consommé, and authentic Mexico City offerings like the huarache.   My only complaint was the limited and undersized chairs and tables.  I am not sure if their usual clientele are umpa lumpas or elementary school children, but some adult sized tables would be an improvement.
5 Went today for lunch.  Found this place in the book "Eating Las Vegas" along side Michelin star restaurants.  Small, clean place with pictures of their plates and hand written specials on the wall. I'm not a mexican food guy so I was a little intimidated but the guy who took my order was very nice, spoke English and was able to make helpful suggestions.  I tried their Mole de pollo as recommended by fellow yelpers. Wow! Though I never had mole before, good food is good food and the mole was delicious. Chicken was tender and moist. I mopped the plate clean with the steaming hot tortillas that come with the plate. They had a drink called "Mango water". Amazing. So good. Refreshing and not too sweet. I complimented the mole as I was leaving and as we talked about the food I could tell that he took a lot of pride in his food. I will definitely be back. Viva la Mexico!
3 Go for the tamarindo drink. That was pretty good.   Tacos were somewhat dry. Mole was less than I expected, although I have to say that not too many places do mole. Consomme was pretty good, but it's chicken broth, avocado and strips of chicken. It's gonna be good! I had the taquiza. The rice and beans were awesome. The taco's different meats were just not too impressive. I tried the Suadero, Tinga, Al Pastor, Mole, and Tripa. Their meats are not juicy enough for me. The tortillas here were perfect. They were soft and fresh. Everything was really fresh, but the culinary desire for more leads me to rate them a three-star. Even their white onion and cilantro could have been more finely chopped.  Their chicken enchiladas came with mole. I have had many great moles. This mole was not a great one. It was a good one.   I lived in Mexico City, D.F. The tacos I had there were absolutely mindblowing. People would stand around taco stands and they would give you consomme as well. The animal fat would serve as the grease for the backdrop of flavorful meat for each taco. The toppings such as cilantro and onions were finely finely chopped. The grill that they used were the ones similar to the ones being used at Tacos El Gordo, even though TEG is Tijuanan style.  At Los Antojos, I feel that the execution of the food could have been so much better and reading all the reviews, I had high hopes for this place. Yes, perhaps some may say that I'm harsh, but if they advertise a regional food, and certain people go there for that regional food, that food should reach or exceed the standards. If this were in Mexico, it would have been one of the least busiest stalls in even areas like Tacubaya.   It is possible that the person cooking my food was an employee instead of the mama other people mention in their reviews. Thus, I will definitely try to come back when the mama is there.
4 The food in this joint is based on street food you find in Mexico city. It's not fancy Lindo Michoacan type where the waiter makes you guacamole at your table . It's a small place, so don't come here expecting great seating.
4 I am not sure how this small, casual, Mexico City-type eatery managed to find its way on the dining guide, Eating Las Vegas:  The 50 Essential Restaurants, but, but the clear chicken broth with an abundance of rice, cilantro, shredded chicken and avocado always satisfies in a way only a homemade soup could.
5 Whole in the wall  off the strip  small and ususally crowded (which means its good)  everything in this place is good. everything. try it, you will love it.   I ate at the Wynn buffet the night before...I paid $36 at the Wynn...for food that lacked flavor and personality. At Los Antojos I paid $12 for food that is made fresh, with love, with flaovr, perosnality, just amazing.   5 stars.
4 The food is made to order and tastes great.  It's a small place and based on the food alone, is probably busy all the time.
5 Best authentic Mexian place in town.  They have so many optins.  Go with the chicken mole verde.  It is delcious.  Enchiladas rock, the alambra is good too.   Shrimp cocktail isnt that great though- I've had much better.
3 we came here on a sunday afternoon and ordered 6 tacos: (2 carnitas, 2 asada, and 2 tinga) and a horchata for 12.   - tacos comes with little meat. compared to el gordo (which although is a bit more expensive), they pack their tacos with more meat and has more flavor. - asada has too much fat. small pieces. - tinga and carnitas were nothing special (shredded beef and pork) - misfire. they sprinkle the cilantro and onions on. few tacos had alot and others had none! lol. - the mom hooked it up with a free refill of horchata :)!
2 it was okay.. nothing more.  the place is really cramped with tiny plastic chairs (like in a classroom) and small tables to match.  this didn't bother me much because i'm tiny too.  the tables weren't sticky either, so that's a plus.  we went at around noon on a wednesday and there were 3 people sitting there eating or watching the olympics on the television.  the guy at the counter was really nice and spoke more english than i expected.  he explained to us what certain things on the menu were and poured us two cups of water.  from your tables, you can see the kitchen right behind the counter and it looks really big and clean.. so one star for that.    i took my mom here and we ordered two tacos and the highly recommended consomme loco (i got a junior size).  all together it costed around 6 dollars and some change.. so that wasn't that bad.  the tacos were the size of a toddler's hands (super tiny) and according to my mom, they were nothing special.  the consomme loco came in a medium sized bowl with pieces of cilantro and onion floating around.  there was shredded chicken and mexican rice in the bottom of the clear broth.  now lets talk about the taste.. it tasted almost exactly like slightly watered down chicken flavored top ramen.  i don't know if it's that top ramen is really good, or this soup is really bad but i didn't really think it was as good as other people said it was.  after eating that soup, i'm left with a really dry and thirsty taste in my mouth.  even though i got the junior size bowl, it was actually really filling and i had to force myself to spoon down the last few drops.  for filling me up, i'll give it another star.    overall, the food wasn't great but at least it wasn't nasty.. i grew up with a lot of mexican friends whose mothers made delicious soup for us all the time, so that's what i was expecting when i came here.  it's not a place i would come to again.   p.s. cash or debit only
5 Best Mexican food I have had in this state. Hands down. Possibly the best Mexican food I have had on earth, but I have only been to Hermosillo, so what do I know? I know this is on both Best Places to Eat in Las Vegas tomes, or whatever it is called, penned by Curtas, Mancini, and that other guy everyone forgets (Jacobson)(I kid!).   I had the Consumme Loco. Never heard of the plate before, and I am still not sure if it is a specifically named plate for this restaurant or widely called that. Don't know. It was delicious so I don't care.   Girlfriend had a cheese quesadilla (she loved it)(said it was the best she had ever had) and for dessert we had platanos with the crazily unhealthy condensed milk spread over it and flan. Delicious, delicious, and delicious. Actually, I did not try the quesadilla so delete one of those deliciouses. Or not, the Consumme Loco deserves two deliciouses.   The bill was absurdly cheap. Really ridiculous. If I were to tip what I thought was missing from the bill should be costing, the tip would be larger than the actual bill. Since I am a cheapass, I only tipped like 30% of the bill into the cup by the cashier machine.   I wish it was closer so I can go more often. I wish I still worked near there so I can go often. I feel like punching myself in the nuts for having eaten at Subway circa 2007/2008 and not having eaten at Los Antojos. And I worked with a Mexican-American who was legit Mexican (father always watch futbol; Spanish-language newspaper being delivered to house and always spread out being read; mother making insanely delicious lunches at house for everyone and adorably anxiously waiting for responses to if people liked it or not). Maybe he knew about Los Antojos and just secretly did not like me.   If you patronise this place and do not like what you eat, there might be something wrong with your taste buds or amygdala. There are no burritos here so don't be an turd and handicap your rating with less stars because you thought you were at Taco Bell®. - E
5 The second time, for EVERYTHING, is never as good as the first. I am basing this on all of the experiences I have in my life on a plethora of matters (you can imagine).   Except Consume Loco. Consume Loco was perhaps fucking better the second time than the first. Motherfucker. Must be the exception to the rule or something.   Tried some tacos for the first time. Chose 'asada' for not particular reason; they were great. Flan and platanos fritos for dessert (again). Girlfriend had two cheese quesadillas. All of this, plus a complimentary plate of chips, for less than twenty five bucks (and that includes a GREATER THAN SYMBOL 25% tip).   Only at Los Antojos. I wish I lived closer so I can go more often, but I will continue to go way out of my way to enjoy this unbelievably delicious authentic Mexican cuisine. - E
4 I was feeling a bit under the weather, so I was really craving some chicken soup. I mentioned this to my roommate and she immediately suggested that I go to Los Antojos and have their Consome Loco. I stopped by and immediately fell in love with this tiny place. It reminds me of the hole in the wall restaurants my mom and I love to go to. It's very cozy and the people are very nice.   The soup was very simple, yet delicious. Exactly what I needed while I was sick. It had chicken broth, shredded chicken, and avocado. It was perfectly seasoned and definitely hit the spot. This will be my go to place when I'm not feeling well. I would also love to stop by and try some of their other menu items.
2 Rumor has it the flautas are amazeballs. Let's see...  The above comment was my check in at Los Antojos.  The excitement ended with that sentence. It wasn't good at all. A Flauta, at least where I come from, is pretty simple. Take everything that a taquito and/or rolled taco is and instead of using a corn tortilla use a flour tortilla. Los Antojos uses Corn tortillas making these not flautas, but rolled tacos. They were pretty good, but not at all what I was expecting. I also wasn't crazy about the take out presentation. Instead of topping off the fake flautas with sour cream and lettuce they were all packaged seperately. I apprecate the consideration of soggy fake flautas, but one thing I love is the pre-made orchaestration of my rolled tacos and/or flautas. I accept the fact that the middle one may be a 3-napkiner, that's okay. Don't make me construct my own lunch though.   Given the reviews I was disappointed, but I only tried one thing on the menu. Not sure I will be back to try another. I will say the place was packed for lunch and several people were eating soup, so maybe I should go a different route if there is a next time.
5 My boyfriend has taken me here five times in the past two months, and it's just amazing! He speaks Spanish, so it's easier for us to order, but they do speak English and their menu is in both languages. My favorite dish is the mushroom quesadillas- these are deep fried, not toasted, so it looks like an empanada. Every time we come the dish is prepared differently, which isn't a bad thing at all. The first time I got it the cheese was melted, but there was still small chunks of cheesy goodness, and the mushrooms were button mushrooms. The second time they still had button mushrooms, but they put in herbs and onions this time. Last night I got shitake mushrooms! Whhhaat??? It doesn't matter how many times they make it different, it's so good! My boyfriend always gets the large Loco soup (it's a chicken soup with rice and avocado slices) and a small chicken taco. We brought my mom last night and she tried everything- now she's converted. The desserts are to die for- we always get flan and fried plantains.They give you a very large slice of flan for about three dollars (try going later, when they are close to closing and they might just give you the rest of the flan they have) and the fried plantains are cooked to perfection, with sweetened condensed milk drizzled over for added sweetness. The best part is it is SO cheap! Two large Loco soup (I mean LARGE), two mushroom quesadillas, one chicken taco, one flan, and one fried plantains= 25$ before tip.
3 I don't get over to the east side often so Los Antojos has been on my to try list forever, but I finally had the opportunity to give it a try. Walking in, I was overwhelmed by the menu. I wanted one of everything. I settled on the enchiladas with mole. I don't find it too often outside of my visits to Mexico so I had to try it. The husband ordered something else that sounded delicious. I don't recall now what it was because there was a mix up in the kitchen and they served two orders of mole. It mattered none to us. No sharing needed. Although, the mole sauce was bit too bitter.   When I find myself in the area I'd seek our Los Antojos again and try another menu item.
5 I've never been one for Mexican food but this place has changed my mind. Most items seemed to be small plate-esque so I ordered two small looking items to get variety: sopes and quesadillas.  The cashier went out of his way to explain that the quesadilla wasn't the typical quesadilla but through the pictures I had figured as much.  It was smaller than what we typically expect and it was fried...still cheese filled and amazing.  The sopes was a corn shell with beans lettuce and sour cream on it.  They had other varieties but went with vegetarian.  Both items were under $3 which makes for a cheap lunch.  They also offer soda pop in the old retro glass bottles which is kind of cool.  Now, why I almost take away a star.  A man walked in to apparently try and sell customers some items...meanwhile the cashier/maybe owner/manager locks the door.  Maybe I am just paranoid but it felt like they were trapping us in there.  There just seemed to be a lot of looks being shot around the room and it was freaking me out.    If I am in vegas again I would surely stop in but mayhaps take it to go. But seriously, amazing food!
3 I like this place because of the "hole in the wall" atmosphere and it's family owned.  The reason I return over and over is because of the chili rellenos. They make it right on point here and the sauce is seasoned and mild. (** = Must try)  PROS: Chili Rellenos**              Bottled Coke              Lengua Torta              Chicken Consomme**  CONS:  Carne asada meat is on the tough side               Loud TV
5 I had tried Los Antojos a couple of years ago after reading John Curtas go on about how great it was. A friend and I went and tried a bunch of different things, like huaraches, and consome loco and were not very impressed.  Fast forward 2 years and everybody I know has been to the restaurant and are raving about it. My friend and I decided to give it another chance. This was three weeks ago and I have been back at least ten times. This place is fantastic! I have been here for both breakfast and lunch, and I've enjoyed pretty much everything I've tried. For breakfast they offer a ton of choices and if nothing on the menu suits you, they can also whip something up. I tried eggs with chorizo and huevos rancheros, both come with different sides like beans, tortillas, bread, etc. My husband tried the borrego (lamb), it comes with a side bowl of consome (super, super rich), cilantro, onions and your choice of bread or tortilla. The owner assured him that with his meal he wouldn't need another meal all day. He was super happy with it, although it was a bit too rich for me. For lunch we've tried the tostadas de tinga (holy crap, they are incredible), tostadas de pollo (meh), sopa de tortilla, tampiqueña and pambazos. Pretty much everything was great. Also, all of their aguas frescas are made in-house.   Since the place is tiny it gets packed quickly, but you can get your food to go. My husband and I are quite obsessed!
3 This mom and pop Mexican restaurant serves authentic fare.  We each ordered huevos rancheros which came with chips & salsa, rice, refried beans and warm tortillas.  The owner also served us complimentary cups of their delicious consomme loco which is a fat free chicken rice soup spiked with cilantro.  Neither of us could do this bountiful meal justice.  Our bill fell short of the minimum purchase requirement on our gift certificate so we ordered a slice of flan to go.  Later the same day we shared the flan which we found to be tasty, but a bit too heavy.
4 Went on a Friday for lunch for the first time. Small hole on the wall type restaurant with 5 small tables and a counter. Employees are super friendly and responsive. I had the consume loco and the tacos cochinita pibil. Both were very delicious! The soup starts off a little bland but throw in a few scoops of green salsa, a couple of the red and a squeeze of lime and now we're talking!
4 I first encountered cochinita pibil at the Taco Bus in Tampa, Florida, and I've been searching for it ever since. Although there is a version of it at Border Grill at Mandalay Bay, I wanted something a little less upscale, and when I read about Los Antojos on Yelp, I couldn't wait to try it.  My husband loves cochinita pibil even more than I do, so he ordered the plate lunch. For less than $8, he got a platter of tasty pork (seasoned with citrus and achiote) with the traditional picked onions, along with rice, beans, and tortillas. I had two cochinita pibil tacos, which were like the small street fare I expected; and a small bowl of the consomme loco, which is a simple chicken, rice, and cilantro soup topped with avocado. Although the soup was tasty, next time I think I'll stick with the tacos, and maybe try one of the others listed on the menu -- the ham and pineapple (jamón y piña) sounds intriguing.  The restaurant itself doesn't look much different from the dozens of similar strip-mall establishments located throughout the city, but the variety of menu options -- especially the inclusion of the aforementioned cochinita pibil (did I say how much I love it?) -- make this "hole in the wall" one worth visiting.
4 Delightful, inexpensive Mexico City inspiried food.  The meat is well cooked, and has a flavor different from what you'd find at anything ending in *bertos.
4 I'll trek across town for this mole again, for sure!
4 This place doesn't get anymore authentic. They have Classic Mexican that taste great.
2 Bookmarked this place after seeing their pambazo torta listed in an issue of LV Weekly, as one of the Top 10 Mexican Meals of the city. I don't remember the ranking, but the description was enough to motivate me to seek this place out.  I ordered the torta, and added on a mushroom quesadilla, based on another review. The quesadilla was a surprise- as others have said, I was initially surprised to see what was essentially a fried, folded tortilla, but after it cooled a bit, I took a bite. That first bite did not wow me. But after the second I took a third, and after the third, I found a mushroom. Jackpot! That thing is damn delicious when you actually get something in your bite that isn't just cheese. Wish the mushrooms were more plentiful, or more evenly distributed, because once you get that perfect bite, there's no going back.  But back to the torta that originally brought me in. To say I was underwhelmed is an understatement. Even digging in right after I received my order, the bread was soggy to the point that it was difficult to eat with my hands. The bread appeared to be soaked in the grease from the chorizo, and I got orange all over my fingertips, hands, and mouth, simply trying to take a bite. I know better than to expect something healthy when I eat Mexican food, but this was overkill. What was most disappointing was the flavor: there really wasn't any. I could tell I was eating potatoes, and in addition to the grease, I stumbled upon some crumbles that let me know my meal contained chorizo, but nothing had flavor.  I added salt, I added salsa, but there was no perking up this dish.   I don't know how this torta made anyone's list of great foods, or if I simply received something other than what they usually serve- but this is not something I'd care to eat again.  Many reviews mention the fabulous mole, and if I'm hungry and hankering for Mexican in the area in the future, I'll consider giving it a try. But for now, I'm going to be a bit more cautious about the food articles in LV Weekly.
2 The rice and beans are delicious.  I ordered the Taquiza taco plate (my choices: suadero, carnitas, pollo con mole, lengua) and besides the mole, none of the meats were distinguishable, they all looked more or less the same and even had a similar consistency and grill flavor.  If i come back I won't order tacos, as they were mostly flavorless.  I am not a huge mole fan, but it was tasty.  The salsas they serve alongside the food sucked:  one verde, one chipotle.  They both tasted unsalted and watered down.  Ive had better, more flavorful salsa from a can (Herdez brand).  The man at the register cared more about the movie on the TV than the customers. Taco y Taco is so much better?
5 I was visiting LV for a conference and coming from CA I'm used to good Mexican food. When the valet at my hotel told me the place was goooood and to bring him back a surprise I wasn't worried at all.  The place is divey for sure, but it's great! I had the chilaquiles (a personal favorite) and they didn't disappoint.  It was so good I brought 5 CA colleagues back with me for dinner the same day. They were pleased with their meals as well - we all cleaned our plates.  One person said the tortilla soups was "out of this world" and another said the beans were nice a light - it's so easy to make them heavy.  It's in a strip mall and easy to miss, but make the U-ie and try again - it's worth it!
