5 They always have the products that we need for our salon iBlowdry and the staff is helpful and knowledgable about what they are selling.
4 I've been here a couple of times with my friend who has the secret entry card to buy items from this place. They have a big selection of Loreal, Redkin and Pureology...I didn't get to look at the other brands, because I've always been a rush the few times I've been in here. They also have a great selection of OPI and Essie nail polishes. Overall, the pricing is definitely than better at many salons. I was able to buy the liter of shampoo and conditioner of Redkin for 30 bucks. Not a bad deal at all...now if only you had someone who had a special entry card as well! =) Customer service is self serve until you get up to the register, but the cashiers have always been friendly.
4 I enjoy going here alot. Jamie is such a doll so its a treat when I go there she helps me every time. Thanks Jamie
