1 Incompetent and rude staff in the office. They do not even acknowledge maintenance requests within a reasonable amount of time, let alone perform the repairs. People are breaking rules e.g. parking, noise, satellite dishes, chairs and garbage out on the landing, which makes it unpleasant.
1 If your a fan of scorpions this place is for you! Infestation galore. Total of 5 scorpions within a month we've dealt with. Especially one that was on our ceiling above the bedroom. Don't take my word for it check out apartmentratings.com for more reviews and pics about your friendly lil roommates. Surprising how the complex would spend money to finally add lights to walk ways instead of investing in professional control for these poisonous insects. This place was great for the price we had high hopes until we found out the home we're suppose to come to after work is more stressful to keep an eye out. If they don't break our lease I'm going to the media and or getting an attorney. Scorpions scorpions!!!!!!
1 Zero! Moved in a month ago. The entire property is infested with cockroaches! I can't even walk my dog because they are everywhere. It's like parting a sea of cockroaches. I've begged the leasing office to spray the property. No avail! Disgusting. I literally live on roach killers and take a can with me when I walk the dog. I can't live here.
1 I have a dozen maintenance requests. None get any response. When I call about it, they send a guy that doesn't know what to do. I'm moving out. I've had it. Beware of this place, it's a hell hole!
1 Everyday I put in another main thence request. The AC is broken, the stoves does not work, my mailbox gets broken into. No response from them. That's it...when you have to move into a hotel to get away from the lack of air in your home that is surrounded my roaches, and you no longer get mail, nor can you cook....it's time to get the hell out!  I'd live in the desert next to a cactus before giving the idiots that run this place money.
