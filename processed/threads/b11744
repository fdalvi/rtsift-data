5 We have been living at the Verona property for almost a year.  The apartment is beautiful and the amenities make you feel like you are at a first class resort.  The pool, spa, and surrounding sunning area are in a magnificent setting.  There is a wonderful clubhouse and well equipped fitness center.  I would highly recommend this property.
1 I live at the W.Post Rd Tesora property. The apartments, grounds, facility are resort quality and beautiful. The staff are all 5 star top notch, very friendly, always handle things promply and efficiently! The location is convenient and quiet.      HOWEVER, all that said, be prepared to pay a small fortune AND for your rent to go up (ALOT) everytime you renew your lease.  I am a long time resident,  have a ONE BEDROOM and pay $1227/mo!!!  They should wear masks.     If money is no object, this is the place for you. Myself, I will be sadly forced to move very soon.
