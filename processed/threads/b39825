4 My husband seriously loves this place (I'm more of Chipotle fan). The food is good and prepared fairly quickly. The burritos are good and the salads are good (both dressings are amazing). My 2-year old gets a free quesadilla when we eat here which is cool.   I did take off a star because, IMO, the price is way too high. We can't seem to come here without spending $30+. (The salad is more expensive than the burrito or the tacos or pretty much anything else on the menu...which is crazy. Really? It's lettuce. Costco sells it in bulk for less than $2.)  That's the only thing that keeps my husband from eating here weekly. Otherwise, pretty good for fast food.
1 Not a fan.  Just took the family here to try it out.  Ordered the steak burrito and fish tacos.  The burrito was overwhelmed with the flavor from the sauce.  The fish had bones in it.  The rice was crunchy from being undercooked.  Was not very happy with this meal.  Total price, with one soda, was ~$24.  We will not eat here again.  Chipotle is better.
4 This Cafe Rio is located on 215&Decatur near the Wells Fargo. The area is busy, so the restaurant can also get that way at times.   Ambiance: 4 - if you haven't been to Café Rio, it has a specific look just like most fast food chains so it looks like a regular Café Rio!! however, sometimes the drink area isn't too clean.  Service: 5 - The service is actually really good here, they are really fast and efficient! Also, they speak Spanish here.   Food: 4 - I really like their food here, especially the chicken tostada. Sometimes they forget things that I ask for on my meal! Love going here because I can buy a salad with horchata!! (and dessert!) The other big food chains can't say the same ;)   Useful Info: if you come here a lot, you should ask for their loyalty card!!
2 Their food, deserves 5 stars, always. Have never been disappointed in their food quality.   What is always a consistent disappointment is placing to go orders via the telephone. I've about had it with this location for that reason. If you offer a convenience of placing to go phone orders then for goodness sake GET IT TOGETHER! This location has consistently forgotten to put the dressing and sides of salsa fresca requested for my salad in my to go bag. So for those of you braving a phone order, it is essential to go behind them like a toddler and check to make sure you've gotten what you've asked for. That leads me to my next gripe. In addition to forgetting extra items asked for this location has consistently gotten my order completely wrong; giving and charging items I never even asked for; not preparing items I asked for the way I asked for them; down to not even getting my name and phone number correct when asked for it.  Last nights event...  I call in to go order for Michael B and also give telephone number. I ask for the following: (1) grilled chicken salad, no tortilla, and only shredded white cheese and black beans for toppings (in addition to the chicken). I also ask for the items to be placed on TOP of my lettuce instead of the bottom like they usually do. The girl starts asking do I want this and that, bla bla bla, I say no, I only want the lettuce, chicken, black beans, and shredded white cheese. I also ask for no dressing and 2 sides of salsa fresca. She says okay no problem. For item # (2) I ask for two grilled chicken tacos with only pico and black beans inside. I specifically mention that I don't want lettuce or anything else inside of it. Just two lonely tacos. She says okay fine. She repeats the order back correctly.   Boyfriend goes to pick up the food and this is what he comes home with...  (1) grilled chicken salad that had tortilla strips, cilantro, cojita cheese, white shredded cheese on top. On the bottom was more shredded white cheese, black beans, and RICE. The bf said they did forget to put the 2 sides of fresca which he had to ask for before he left (guess he has learned this from previous times).  (2) two chicken tacos with PINTO beans, pico, and cheese inside.  (3) on a separate plate we got another set of chicken tacos prepared the same way but with a side of rice and pinto beans as well.   So he comes home with this crap and I take a look at the receipt. The name is listed as "Mitcheal Q." and the phone number I gave is off by 1 digit. The rest of it describes the wrong order they gave me. I call and ask to speak with the manager on duty, gal responds asking me what the problem. I say there's a problem with my pick up rose being wrong. She says what's wrong with it, I said I need to speak with a manager on duty. She continues to try and ask about the order and if the manager can call me back. Again I tell her to please get the manager on the phone, no they cannot call me back, if I were a customer in the restaurant they would have to address my concerns them and there so why should I be treated any different because I am on the phone. So she places me on a "hold" which sounded like she just stuck the phone in her pocket and walked around a bit. Then she comes back on the line stating I'm sorry the manager can't come to the phone because they're "on the line working". She again asks about the meal and what was wrong. So I give her a nice ear full and she asks would I like a free meal. Would I like A free meal as in one? NO! I would like 3 free meals because I was charged for one I didn't ask for and my two I did ask for was given severely incorrect. She quickly obliges to my request and asks for the name the order was under so she can make a note in the computer about it.   Only after I hang up I realize that they messed up the name on our order so there's no way she will be able to note the account correctly.    I will probably continue to go to this location but only as a walk in customer so I can supervise them making my food as directed through the nifty "subway" like set up. I'm convinced it's not a guest experience thing being able to watch them make your food in front of you. It's so they don't muck it up. Because on the phone they've never let me down. Mucked. Up. Every. Time.
1 Tried to give this Cafe Rio a chance, but its a fail. Consistently no ice for drinks, today there is no avocado and I get charged full price, and the bathroom area by the drink station frequently smells like a sewer. The staff usually displays an indifferent attitude as well. Maybe a management change is in order? I will never come to this location again. Im usually the one not to complain.....but there are improvements that need to be made...like yesterday.
1 Frequented this location since it opened...initially it had lots of promise but it continues to slide down that slippery slope of carelessness, indifference, and apathy that many restaurants get when staffed with minimum wage teenagers who don't care one bit about the job they're doing...fast food restaurants should learn from places like In-N-Out and Chipotle when it comes to the people they hire...but alas, you get what you pay for and the Cafe Rio franchise is getting back what they invest in their personnel...nothing!
3 Not sure what all the hype is with this place, but personally I think it's alright, but everyone else I know and work with LOVE this place and because of that, I'm dragged over here every few months. Cafe Rio is kind of like an overpriced Chipotle, where you can order burritos, tostadas, etc and they'll make the food right in front of you. The meats seem kind of dry to me and the burritos are pretty plain..only meat, sauce and cheese...really? There is also no option on the menu to order just a bowl so I have to get the burrito. Did I mention it was dry? They do offer a stamp card so your meal is free after I believe 10 stamps. I never bring it in since I come here a handful of times a year. For the price at over 10 bucks for a burrito and small drink, I don't think it's that great of a place...I'll stick with my Chipotle any day
1 Worst cafe rio I've ever been to. Consistently out of something. There hasn't been a single time I've gone there that they've had everything I've asked for. The food quality is good with the missing ingredients aside.   The customer service is also atrocious. The first time I got attitude I wrote it off as the girl having a bad day, but it's consistently that way.  If there was another one close to my house I would never go to this cafe rio.
2 I don't even know why i would give this place more than one star, because it's got to be the worst cafe Rio in town...almost always they get something in my order wrong...the last time I was here I got the quesadilla...while it tasted fine, it was poorly 'constructed' I mean there was barely any cheese in there and the steak was all clumped up in the same area...and the worker doing the griddle for the quesadilla just seemed like she didn't wanna be there the way she was making the food, she was even mean to her own co-workers, with a 'don't talk to me' attitude towards them...better find another cafe Rio if you're around this area
1 I am giving this one star because I can't give a lower rating.   I was there for over am hour trying to order a pork burrito. After 35 minutes in line,  when I got up to where I could order,  they were out of pork so I elected to wait the extra 20 minutes they said it would be.  I sat at a table and took a 20 minute nap. Then,  as instructed,  I went to the cashier (who was NOT at all helpful) to give her my order.  She continued to check people out and after almost 15 minutes,  took my order.  I waited another 20 minutes before other employees noticed and asked what was going on.   Three different people ended checking on my order before I got it.  They did give it to me free but that definitely didn't make up for it.  I spoke to another woman who was also waiting and discovered she had ordered ON-LINE (it is supposed to be VERY fast if you do that.   She waited just over 45 minutes for her order.   I will NEVER go there again,  nor well I patronize any of their affiliates.  I hope anyone who reads this also doesn't go there.   They obviously don't care about their patrons. Update:  When I got home and opened the box,  it was missing lettuce,  pico , napkins, and tableware.  Really ?????
1 Okay, they even get orders wrong as a walk in. I specifically asked for grilled chicken enchi's and she puts shredded chicken in them! Really? Next to that, customer service...horrible. Everyone in there looks so down and out, just slumming away; no smiles, speak to you very emotionless. One girl even says to a man that walks up to the counter "ya what do you need?". Where is management at this place? I thought about asking to speak with a manager but seeing as how the employees are mummily (ya I made that word up) serving guests, I couldn't help but think that they are a reflection of how their management is allowing them to act, so it probably wouldn't be worth it. Such a shame the staffs personality and service doesn't match their delicious food.
1 The worst Cafe Rio I have been to.  This past Sunday, out of fajita chicken and beef at 5:00 P.M.    The staff did not appear to be very engaged.  Almost like they were picked from a reality show and made to work at a random location.    Close to my house, but underwhelming.
1 Been a cafe rio fan for over 10 years growing up in Utah , can say that this cafe rio is the worst , still standing online with only 6 people ahead of me , going on 20 minutes now , ridiculous , also just heard them say 15 minute wait for steak ! Sad to say this cafe rio will never get my business again .
2 The food is great but service is terrible at this location. I accidentally asked for the house dressing instead of the vinaigrette and you would have thought I asked them for the world on a platter. The restaurant was an absolute mess, napkins and food all over the floor, sticky tables and even though I informed someone that the soda fountain was out of syrup, it wasn't attended to the entire time we were there.   It's a shame to have such a poor representation of this great chain.
1 Worst cafe rio I have ever been too. Completely Out of all their juices and their brewed tea's didn't have lids exposing the deliciousness of that which is tea to all the environmental factors. Beans were slimy. Not a very pleasant working staff either.  The cheery on top is the airconditoning unit was broken.
2 I love cafe rio and the food is really good but this location is horrible. They always run out of salmon I went for a whole month once a week on my day off and I only got to eat my salmon salad once because they always run out. To make matters worse they don't even bother putting out a sign and I waited in a long line for them to tell me they had no more salmon it was 1 in the afternoon. Its insane to me how they can run out. Today I absolutely had to yelp them because I stood in a long line and finally gave up and left. I left because I got close enough to realize why the line was so slow and long because they ran out of tortillas. What kind of mexican restaurant runs out of tortillas. Once again nothing was said to anyone in line. The line came to a complete stop while they tried to make the dough. Then they would throw the dough away and start again lokking and looking at the recipe. I just don't understand its friday night you should expect to be busy. I will say this it was the last time ill ever go to this location I will go an extra 10-15 minutes away to the centennial location from now on. I'm done with this location.
1 The service is horrible.  We support local business and we tried to give this establishment the benefit of the doubt.   They could never get our orders right.  When we tried ordering online, our food was never ready at the promised time.    Last night, we ordered the chicken salad and pork salad and again...it was not ready at the promised time. After finally getting it home, we discovered there was no pork in the pork salad. We brought it back and asked to speak to the manager. She was apologetic but offered nothing to keep our business.   We will never do business with the Cafe Rio chain again.
1 Hands down worst service in vegas!! Lord forbid any of them crack a smile! I frequent here due to loving the food, plus location wise... It is the best option for us.  At this point the one at centennial may be worth the drive! The owner really needs to get rid of the whole staff and try again. I truly can not stand bad costumer service. Why work in costumer service if you hate it?!? They all seriously look miserable as the THROW your food together! I really hope the owner/manager reads all of these reviews and does something about it.
4 I have been to this location a couple of times,  because it's my go to meal on the go, I usually order the taco salad with the whole wheat soft taco, it's my all time favorite,  but today i decided on the special Mahi Mahi fish tacos,  i totally enjoyed it, fish was fresh and i love the rice and beans, the drink order that comes with the meal is your choice of sodas but i got the mint limeade, it's sweet but i do enjoy it. I do agree that the customer service could be better, i always feel so rushed when i have to place my order. This location is the closest and convenient for me, so i am a regular here, I also love the free meal after you order 10..that's always a perk .
1 One of the worst things about Yelp is that there are no options for Zero stars for restaurant's that truly deserve it. That statement is only for this location and not for the Cafe Rio chain as the others I have been to have all been wonderful, but the management at this location is truly horrendous. If you want a better experience go to the one next to Sportsman's Warehouse and you will see what this chain really stands for. The store on Decatur is a easy fix, just bring in a manager that actually knows how to run a restaurant and isn't insulting to customers. The manager is truly a piece of work and really need to be retrained. I have been in sales and traveled the western US for the past 40 years and I have never come into contact with worst customer service, this guy really takes the cake.
