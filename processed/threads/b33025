4 Blink and you may miss the parking lot entrance! This QT is conveniently located but finding the entrance to the parking lot is easily missed if you don't enter from the  neighboring business's lot.
5 Friendly faces behind the counter. Workers always helpful. Store is always clean.  Has what I am looking for and need a good majority of the time.   One drawback: You have to pay attention when driving in order to find this location because you can easily miss the entrance.
4 I like QuikTrip. This location is close to work and home so that is a plus. Can't beat a 32 oz fountain drink for $0.69. Plus they have Coke Zero so that is worth an extra star right there. Sandwiches are pretty good and for $5 for a sandwich chips and a drink that is a good deal. I love their glazed donut holes. So good and just enough in a pack. Nice and clean and friendly staff. You really are in and out quick. Plus it is easy to find and convenient. I will keep coming back here for a snack attack or lunch sometimes.
