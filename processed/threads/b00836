1 I ordered the teriyaki chicken, which is apparently their specialty, and priced accordingly.  It was $7 for a medium sized bowl and drink.  The chicken was mediocre and the rice was kinda gummy.    Even still, this wouldn't have warranted the one star until I bit into a chunk of bone that they forgot to sift out.  Nasty.
1 I worked near there a couple years ago and would blindly walk in there on my lunch breaks over and over, ignorantly forgetting how mediocre the food was.  But I recently saw a Stixx has opening near there, so I don't even know if they are still in business...
1 dee-skusting!  ate here once, the food was horrible, portions were microscopic.  try it if you don't believe.  don't tell me i didn't warn you  save your hard earned cash for another place and time
