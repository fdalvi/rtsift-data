1 Stay away stay far away! On phone and in their web sight they do not tell you of all the hiden fees. Cleaning fee $13.00  drop off fee $20.00, $12.00 to be picked up at airport.  When I picked up the car it was never cleaned. I upgraded at a cost of $5.00 per day and was told their printer was down but wrote down the final cost the manager told me. When I droped off my car on a Sunday at 11 am they were closed and I left the keys and sales slip, Big mistake it was a field day for them. They charged me an additional $120.00 in hidden fees which makes it more than renting from the national car rentals from the airport.  When you call to protest the lady manager tells you of all the hidden cost and puts her male manager on and he yells at you then hangs up!  I followed up with my credit card company for to assist me in this miss-leading credit card charges. Please read all reviews and do not rent from this company
1 THE BIGGEST SCAM Ever! I went there because I needed a 'cheap' price on a rental. They told me $139.00 and charged me $294.00!!! Go to a real car rental place. 2003 Taurus for $294.00 a week with 160,000 + miles? I could have bought that POS.
1 Terrible is all I have to say. Van was a piece of junk. Had to use a knife to unlock passenger door. We feared doors would fly open at any moment. Seat belts stayed locked and nearly choked out passengers. Dirty, broken parts, stains, burns yet they charged us a cleaning fee. Oh the fee's, $99 turned into $280, what a joke. While going up hill the engine sounded like it was going to explode. Van was given to us on empty, but when we returned with more gas no discount was given. Completely rude when we asked about extra charges.  Sincerely, stay away from these dangerous vehicles and crooks. 0 stars. Also known as Saban Car Rental.
