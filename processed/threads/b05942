5 Super friendly staff and more importantly - honest.
5 I was really surprised to see this wonderful team has only one review on yelp! They deserve way more, so here's my contribution:  I was lucky enough to find Paradise Auto Body after I nastily got rear-ended at a stoplight. Then my AC was out and I knew where I was going to take care of it.  This is a family-owned, friendly, honest, professional, quick and comprehensive body shop! These people know their stuff! Their prices are reasonable, they'll tell it to you like it is, and even clean your car after a repair.   Thank you Jackie, Jesse, Ashley and everyone else at Paradise, for taking care of me and my car! I'm seriously going to miss you :)
5 We use this company all the time for both business and personal needs. Every single customer experience with them has been exceptional. All staff has been extremely polite and professional. Their quality of work is great!  I usually deal with Jackie but have also spoke with a gal named Jess who is great also. I highly recommend this company to my fellow Yelpers! I will always use this company for any body shop needs.
