5 There is no faster, more dependable, reliable or more knowledgeable AC service in the valley than Croffoot Heating and Air Conditioning. For the 2nd time in 2 years, I've had a bad capacitor, (that little silver canister on the back of the compressor outside the house) go out on 2 separate units in the heat of summer. You know when that goes out, because suddenly the air is blowing, but it keeps getting hotter. The first time was literally on the 4th OF JULY, when I had a houseful of weekend guests, the worst timing ever! Kirk showed up within an hour and had the problem fixed in minutes, since he was prepared enough to have the part on hand. This year, it happened again, and he showed up even faster, knowing what the problem already was from Susie's phone triage.  If you want a guy who shows up with a smile that you feel you know within seconds, who you can trust with your system from top to bottom, call Croffoot.
5 Called Croffoot after waking up to No A/C.  They promptly returned our call and scheduled to come out same day (heading into record heat weekend).  Prior to showing up I received a call the  technician was running ahead of schedule and could be there an hour early if I was available  (when was the last you heard that?). Kirk arrived and promptly diagnosed and fixed the issue.  The A/C was up and running shortly after arrival.  Very professional, prompt, and reasonably priced.  What else are you looking for? Will use Croffoot for all future needs.
5 This is your guy.  A locally owned business where customer service and honesty are at the top.  We have been using Croffoot for over 4 years and even had them install  a new unit at my Mother's house.  They are very fair in their pricing and will work with you.    Support the good guy call Croffot!
5 Kirk and Susie are superb!  Susie does a great job troubleshooting over the phone.  Kirk is prompt, courteous, professional and always thorough!  I will never use anyone else for my A/C needs
