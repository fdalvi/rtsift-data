5 I went to this location when it was owned previously by the Weavers, and I'm very glad that Andy is just as honest as they were.  The prices are very fair, he does excellent work, and its a quick turnaround.  I'd very highly recommend him.
5 Awesome shop.  Great service,  Great prices,  Great people.  Have gone to the shop a few times for a few issues with my car.  They were able to fix everything that I had problems with and offered great prices.  It makes me feel very comfortable knowing I'm getting taken care of and I'm not getting taken for a ride.  (No pun intended) The best part of this shop is I hadn't been there I'm a year and when I walked in today the owner remembered my name.  It's a nice feeling to know I'm not just another client but a valued customer.  Keep up the great work 29th Street Auto.
5 My boyfriend and I just moved here from Los Angeles. I had some rattling or metal grinding noises when I would accelerate my Subaru. Andy and his team worked on my car for an hour, diagnosed the problem and fixed it. On my boyfriends end, his air conditioner went out in his Hyundai and this was also fixed within the hour. The cost was beyond reasonable. The guys were super professional, but even more importantly we trust and value the work. Very pleased to have found a reputable auto shop that we can turn to whenever maintenance is required. Thanks 29th St Auto!
