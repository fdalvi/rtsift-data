1 I didn't know it was possible to serve a bad BLT, but this place manages to do it. The service is slow and unfriendly. The food is mediocre at best.
1 Yes, GUS Please come buy this place and save it from it's sad, awful existence. Went in apparently 10 minutes after they stop serving breakfast. Who has ever seen a diner that does not serve breakfast all day? I was told they had put it all away, you mean like back in the fridge where it would be anyway. It is pretty obvious this place gets about 1 customer a day if that as the ENTIRE restaurant is quartered off and they only use the tiny front portion. Oh and no croutons for my salad on top of a completely bland and unimaginative menu. JUST CLOSE AND GET OUT OF MY TOWN!
