4 I recently needed to have dental work done. Just moved to the area and it was hard to find a good dentist..........Well here in San Tan Valley we have one. From  walking in the door the office personnel make you feel very comfortable. Dr Tim went to work on my mouth and a couple hours later I was feeling much better and did not feel any pain during the ordeal.   I highly recommend Hill Family Dentistry for the any work on your mouth. www.hillfamilydentistry.com.
4 Nice new office and Dr. Hill is the man! He's a great dentist who's very upfront with you and doesnt beat around the bush. His office staff is also very nice and non-judgemental of you so if you got some issues with your peraly whites, this is the place to be in San Tan!   The only negative I have to say is the practice in whole has very poor follow up. Although they ttry to call and remind you of your appointment they dont follow up with you as much as they should. I think this situation will fix itself but Dr. Hills practice continues to grow, I was a client when it first opened and thats the only change I ve noticed.
5 I recently moved to San Tan Valley and needed a good dentist. A friend recommended Dr Hill and I made an appointment to have my first cleaning in a years. I am so glad I found him because (1) he is an incredible dentist who treats his patients so well (2) I love his office staff (no mumbling or gossiping) and (3) he is honest. I had been told for years that I needed to have gum surgery done. He took one look and said I was fine. That saves me the money, time and hassle of doing that if I don't even need to have it done. Since my first visit I went back because I had a root canal. He did an A+ job and has answered any questions I have.   Thank you Dr Hill and the Hill Family Dentistry team!
