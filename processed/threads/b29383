1 I called these guys to get a quote to replace my window. After reviewing them with the BBB (A+ Rating) and getting multiple bids, I decided to go with them.  The rep said they would need to come out to measure the window, but quoted me a price on the phone. When their guy came out they said the window location was much different than they thought and couldn't do it because they don't have scafolding.  (A window company without scafolding...nice!) In the end, they suggested I call Glass Doctors so they could do the job because these guys couldn't.  In reality, they underbid the job based upon assumptions they made which were inconsistent with anything I told them. Net-net, don't waste your time with these guys.
4 I had a new shower built by these folks back in 2011 and it's been holding up great.  They were quick, did a good job, and stand behind their work.  I had some warranty repairs done a few months ago.  Very happy with the service I got and the end product is very nice
5 We had them replace two broken windows and install a new shower enclosure in our master bathroom. It look great and everything from ordering to installation went like clockwork. After the installation we had their sister window cleaning company, Squeeky Kleen Windows clean our window and it was the best window cleaning job we have ever had.   After reading the first review on here I really checked them out so I would discounted that review. They have three companies that provide many home services including remodeling, glass work and window cleaning. They have over 1,000 five out of five star reviews on  their three websites and have been in business since 1999 with a very high rating on both Angie's list and the BBB.
