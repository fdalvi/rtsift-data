5 Misty has been doing my hair for over 8 years.  She is a great stylist.  She has a a flair for color, and also for cutting.  We've gone from short and choppy and very blonde to shoulder length and warmer.    I highly recommend Misty and think you should give her a try.  You'll like the way you look.
5 I've known Misty for two decades (does that show my age?) and she is the only person who is allowed to touch my hair, besides myself. I'm always wanting new looks and custom dye jobs and she is never hesitant to follow along.  Last week I decided I wanted purple throughout the underneath of my hair and my usual blonde weave on top. It's a complicated process and time consuming but she's a pro and can mulit-task. The best thing about her talent is she won't finish until your hair is perfect. And she's not afraid to tell you like it is. She won't let you walk out of the salon with some celebrity hairstyle that does not fit your features and would just look ridiculous.  Misty is caring, thoughtful, and listens. She gives great advice on how to maintain a style and give proper hair care. The products she carries are top of the line.  I take my fickle teenage daughter to Misty as well. She changes her mind about her hair just as much as I do. Misty lets my daugter know what is realistic and what is just poor teenage fads. But no matter what, my daughter is pleased and her friends are always wanting the same thing. Last week Misty did a vibrant red and it was stunny.  Her prices are reasonable and you receive that high level of customer satisfaction. The salon is inside Signature Studios and Misty is always offering snacks and beverages for her clients. She takes care of you!
5 Misty is the best!  She has been doing my hair for about 4 years as well as members of my family and she is wonderful!   She just did my niece and got her and the wedding party ready for the wedding...she was awesome!
