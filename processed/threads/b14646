5 As a small business owner moving into a new location, there are a zillion details to attend to. This being the first time I'd ever had to deal with signage for my business, I was a bit daunted. The property manager referred me to Arrowhead Signs and I could not be happier with my experience.   Dan and Stephanie took terrific care of me as a "nervous nelly" client, taking time to work through the quote with me, ensuring I was getting exactly what I needed and wanted. The pricing was very reasonable and the end product FANTASTIC!!!
1 Great looking sign, poor stand, poor customer service. Way too many options out there. Stay away from this company. The owner is rude, temperamental and unhelpful. Sold us a false bill of goods and blamed us for ordering the wrong item.
