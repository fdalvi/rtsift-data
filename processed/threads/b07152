5 They replaced a large window; did a great job and didn't leave a mess for us to clean up.  They also matched our existing windows perfectly (with another brand).  The cost was exactly what we expected, and follow up was good.  We would use them again, without question.
1 Where to begin.  We ordered an above average priced interior door that included glass panels on both sides and top on February 3, 2014.  One half payment was made on February 15 with an order time of 4 to 6 weeks.  When the installers arrived during the first week of April, the door was hinged on the wrong side.  Gee, it will be another 4 weeks.  I then got an e-mail from Chip (I never received a telephone call from Chip during the entire process only cryptic e-mails).  We were then e-mailed and told that the new parts were damaged and we would have to wait another 4 weeks.  When I said 'Geeez, ok' in an e-mail back to Chip, I got a call from the door manufacture, not Chip saying that they were sorry about the problems.  Finally, after waiting over 11 weeks, the door was finally installed.  Still no call from Chip to see if the installers did a nice job or was the job satisfactory.  Within one day, we received the bill for the second half... no note or call of thanks or apology for the delay and not even a gift certificate for a burger.  I would not recommend this business to anyone.
