4 I am finally going to write a coherent review that does not labor with ramblings before the actual review. One that succinctly gets to the point and does not meander through the muddy waters of trying to come up with an anecdote that gets the point across without actually delving into a review of the actual place. Oh damn, I've done it again. Here goes...  What can I say Mr. Thomas, not sure if that is his real name, you do a very good job.  I have taken numerous shirts and trousers to him and he makes sure that they fit according to my specifications. Examples: Shirt sleeves shortened and darts added so that it fits closer to the body. Trousers hemmed, tapered, and the seat taken in so it is not baggy.  It can be expensive, depending on what kind of work you are getting done, but the workmanship is excellent. I would definitely recommend this tailor.
4 I went there for a pretty simple thing.   They did it fast and they did it right.   No complaints.
