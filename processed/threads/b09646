2 The food here is what I'd expect from a Wendy's, but don't go into the dining room if you're in a hurry. They obviously give the drive-thru top priority and you can wait upwards of 15 minutes for your food. The dining room was clean and the people were friendly. I'll go back, but I'll be staying in my car.
4 I swung by one evening on my way who knows where (I drive big rigs). You guys were busy, pretty DAMN busy!! The store was clean and organised just the same! a nice thing to see considering some of the dining tragedies i get to see in my profession. You had 1 person that stood out of the group of hard working employees. Her name was Alyssa, and she kicked many butts! She was kind, thorough and proficient. She took my order and was clearly in a "zone". like a well oiled cog, she moved fluidly through the madness and still had the poise to ask if i needed extra napkins! To you Alyssa I say "Bravo"!! I look forward to going there again!
5 First of all, it's Wendy's, so obviously it's fast food. And it's in a pilot gas station stop so tons of big rigs. But the customer service there is phenomenal. The gentleman in the afternoon, I think his name is Sam, walks around and asks how is your day going and if he can refill your drink. But he sounds so honest when he asks how your doing. There is another gentleman At the cashier, can't remember his name but he remember me After one visit And was very kind and helpful. Good job Wendy's team and management.
