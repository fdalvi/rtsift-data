1 Tried to make an appointment on line twice.  They show available dates and times that are not available.  The office confirmed the appointment only to call back and ask for the appointment to be rescheduled at their convenience.  If you don't have the availability do not make it available on line.
4 Great dentist if you can get over the appointment process
5 This is a great dental office. All of the staff, Samantha, Isaac, and Dr Wills are all great. All staff is caring and compassionate to the needs of the patient. They always value your time and they mAke sure you don't leave the office until your work is 110%.  I would recommend Grand Canyon Dental to any one.  if you are nervous about going to the dentist, Dr Wills is great at calming you down. When it comes to  explaining your work to you, Dr Wills talks to you in terms that the general public is able to understand. Again, if you're looking for a GREAT dentist, choose GRAND CANYON DENTAL!!!!!
5 I think some dentist should be aware of Dr. wills, because in my point of view in few years for sure 5-10 he is going to be one of the best name out there. It amazed me to see Dr. Wills, the guy have so much confidence, wit and understanding of the dental procedure not just for general dentistry but for other areas such as root canals, oral, implants and more, furthermore, he is explain it answer your questions and not giving this task to his staff, which is annoying in other dental clinics. Let me tell you that the stuff are amazing, profoundly appreciate all their hard work, Samantha is great and responsive, tell me how many dental offices will answer your e-mail in the weekend or will call you to check on you???, not many! the DA's Great as well, smiling, happy which tells you the office is happy and they are doing something there that works. Yes, I see Dr. Wills in few years have one shop that will focus on your Hollywood smile! and I think there is no other place that will make you happy to achieve it.
