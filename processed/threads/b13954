4 I am so sorry I didn't come here sooner! This is a great sports bar not far from our house. The service was very friendly, and the killer wings (they also have honey BBQ) were awesome. They had tons of meat on them, which isn't always the case with wings, as I am sure most of you can attest.  We also had the margherita pizza, which was pretty tasty. There were numerous TVs scattered throughout the restaurant, and they had $1 beers (yes $1) when we were there - fantastic deal!  This place is definitely more chill than Fox Sports Grill (not quite as fancy or upscale), but it's a perfect sports watching or beer drinking venue nonetheless.   Oh, and they deliver!!!!!! Good choice if you live in North Scottsdale.
4 I have been coming to Oggi's for awhile now and I have always had great experiences!  There are never a lot of people there and the food is served up quick.  They make their own beer and have a decent IPA which is very HOPPY.  They also have HOP JUICE!   If you're on a budget, just ask for a "sample" of the hopjuice and they will give you one.  Whalla!  You just got a SHOT OF 14% beer for FREE.  Haha!  Anyway, the WINGS ARE THE BEST.  I get the killer wings and request them GRILLED.  I also love their pizza titled SLAM DUNK which is made with the WING SAUCE!!
1 There really isn't anything special about this place.  It was a default lunch location for people in my office, but in reality- it sucked.  I would end up not eating rather than going with everyone and eating there.  Everything I've had there was greasy- except the salads, which are so-so.  I'd rather eat at home than eat here.
4 Contrary to some other reviews, I do like this place- For sports viewing and decent food! They have lots of TV's with all college and pro football games on, so its pretty easy to watch your out of town team (Oakland Raiders) on one of their screens. Salads are just OK, wings are great, and pizza is better than average. Went here recently for lunch, midweek, and the service was really lousy, like other reviewers had pointed out. But, this is a great place to watch a  game and have some munchies. They are Hockey-Friendly as well!
1 Don't even bother. The food served had no relation to the beautiful pictures on the menu. Plus the excuses we got for the inconsistancy were laughable. JR
