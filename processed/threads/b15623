3 32 ounces of coffee for $1.18.  Is it worth the walk here from MGM Grand?  Yes, yes it is.
3 So while this is the cheapest gas station near the south end of the strip that I know of. That they have a lil convenience store is just a bonus. However this gas station has something no other gas station that I have been to has, ever!  If you come here between 7 and 9 am on a saturday or sunday morning, you can see all the hookers fill up their cars. Talk about complete and total entertainment for free! These women have some of the skankiest outfits, worst tattoos, and overall funky demeanor of almost anyone that I have ever seen.  One day I literally posted up here for like 30 minutes just people watching. Absolutely ridiculously funny. Some of the best people watching ive ever had outside of an airport. I highly suggest hanging out here for some chits n grins =D  Pro Tip: Be careful when you pull in here its insanely busy at this place.  Overall its a typical gas station otherwise. They have good prices, take all the standard credit cards, and are rocken just as you would hope. Definitely just an easy fill up so head on down.
2 Stopped here for gas, found this and other Rebels I saw around town to be shabbier than the am/pm, and this certainly had less selection in the convenience store.
