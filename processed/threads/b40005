5 Cantor Nesis will add that unique, extra special atmosphere to your wedding, baby naming, or Bar Mitzvah service. Her voice is angelic and your guests will be enchanted! She is also bilingual, so both English and Spanish speaking guests will be able to understand the meaning and importance behind the Jewish ceremony.
5 Simply put, Cantor Nesis is amazing.  In March of 2012, Cantor Nesis performed a personalized wedding ceremony for us, in English and Spanish (and Hebrew), that we continue to get compliments about from family and friends.  Cantor Nesis took the time to get to know my wife and me, and even met with my in-laws before the wedding to explain the Jewish wedding traditions, since they were not familiar with the customs.  She has a beautiful voice and is one of the kindest people you will meet.  We highly recommend Cantor Nesis; she will make your celebration unforgettable.
5 Cantor Nesis is amazing. She was professional. Also, she took time to prepar my fiance and I to prepare for our very special and important wedding ceremony. I heard more compliments about Cantor Nesis than any other aspect of my wedding night.   Highly recommended
