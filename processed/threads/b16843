4 Hoops under new Management. Friday Night free comedy shop T 10 PM. if you have time check it out.
3 Came here for a party and its a really nice spot kind of tucked away that you  wouldn't expect.  My only gripes were the parking, they share their lot with a smaller car lot/rental service so  parking is a pain and can be very tight. People were literally blocking others in just to park, not their fault of course but an annoyance either way. Additionally their bar servers were  lacking in skill set. You could tell they weren't used to the amount of business that they had  that particular night but there were whole sections of the bar being totally ignored. Many people were frustrated with the service. They had four people behind the bar and it still managed to be slow and with incident. Oh well, I guess I shouldn't be too upset, I was able to get a drink!  For another birthday or occasion I would come back but thats probably about it.
3 My review for this place will be very limited for a number of reasons. We came here in the middle of the day after visiting some clients. Booze was off limits as we had more clients to see afterward. So both the co worker and I opted for a water. I had the jalapeno burger and fries. It was really not anything special and if it was not loaded up with all sorts of artery clogging deliciousness, the burger itself would have been pretty bland. The bartender was sweet and attentive even while chatting up some of the regulars that had started to trickle in. The bathrooms were clean and I would not be opposed to stopping in during happy hour to see what they have to offer then. Middle of the day while drinking water is probably not the best way to accurately gauge a bar, but based on the sub par food, but great service, I feel it was just a-ok.
5 Two words! Tina Mateo. She makes this place fun to hang out at anytime! The Food and Gaming Specials are great too. Limited graveyard menu as well.
