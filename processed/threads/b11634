5 You can never go wrong with Subway!! Especially this month, they're having a special any $5 footlong! Healthy and fulfilling!
4 Fast and friendly employees, my sandwich is always made correctly, and I'm in and out in a matter of minutes. There's never a wait at this location when I stop by here, which is usually during breakfast or dinner times. A few times a year they run a $3 breakfast special and of course you can never go wrong with those $5 or $6 footlong specials
3 Stopped in with part of the family to grab some sandwiches to go. The staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean. It seemed a little dark going in. Not sure if this is typical or if a light might have been out. I opted for a six inch Cold Cut Combo, which was actually rather filling. I usually do a foot long, but six inches satisfied this time. We also ordered a Philly Cheese Steak, but got Pastrami by mistake. The kid ate it anyway and said it was pretty tasty. We will return.
4 Subway is alway a good fast food choice. I normally just go with their monthly $5 special.  This location is well kept with fast friendly staff.
