5 Had to find a new powder coater since my usual place went out of business recently.  After a lot of checking a round I ended up here.  Glad I did. Great work, fair price & quick turn around.
5 I had to get two large pieces coated in less than a week. My normal powder coater was backed up for 3 weeks. I called Vyne after a recommendation from another shop. These guys did a fantastic job; on time and on budget.. I'll defiinitely hit them up again.
4 Had the guys at Vyne do a a large hoop for a table I was building, it came out great, and they got it done in three days. I discovered they have a $75 minimum, which I thought was a bit steep for what it was, but I am still happy with their work.
5 These guys do a great job on time. We use them constantly for our in house manufactured products and they are consistant in color and quality every time.
5 Wow,  what an amazing job they did!!   I had an old Bistro set that looked so bad and they made it look brand new!!   So impressed!!   Very nice owner and employees,  will use them again.
5 Everyone was so nice and they are great people. Thanks again for turning my old metal clamshell chairs into something beautiful.
