4 Fast friendly service and fresh food.  Orange chicken Is always the bomb.
3 Its cool. There was a bum.
2 I was so excited to have lunch at Panda Express, however this location is sad.  Very sad.  Normally the Panda Express experience is inviting, hip, fresh and satisfying.  This location is in dire need of some corporate attention.  The chow mien noodles are my go to and I usually have to always get the orange chicken.  The egg rolls here looked like they were from yesterday and were crusty, the won tons were not fresh and had the look of stones, as if they were morphing into Chinese throwing stars.  Gross.  I advanced to the point were I had to pay and I ordered a large drink.  I got the blackberry tea which was great, but... no splenda or sweet and lo.  Nothing at all.  I had to go back to the register and was only able to get sugar... which I did not want.  So I went without.  It was still thirst quenching.. but not ideal.  The whole drink area was a mess as was the dining area.  Even though I asked for dining in, they still packed me to go... was this a hint? or was it that they ran out of plates.  I think the latter.  I will say that the new grilled chicken breast with teriyaki was delish.  Let me state, I am not sure if it is all that new as I have not been to a Panda for some time.  I was saddened overall.  Just a terrible location.
