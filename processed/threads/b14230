4 This place has really bad reviews on hotels.com but I was surprised to not see anyone yelp about it! A yelp review would have been really helpful, so here I go..  I was VERY happy with my stay here. I was really hesitant to book a room here because of all the bad reviews, but I didn't want to spend alot of money and I needed a place that was dog friendly. Upon arrival the man behind the counter was very friendly. I had about 10 million questions about where things were located and he was very helpful. Our room was nice and big and very clean. It kind of smelled like paint when we first came in, but it eventually went away. The AC was nice and cold, the beds were comfy, and the maids were very accommodating as well. Also, the pool was great, people seemed to only swim at night, but I was trying to take advantage of the Arizona sun for an awesome tan, so I always had the pool to myself! Overall, it was a great deal, a goodnight stay for 39.99! If you're on a budget, I highly recommend this place!
1 This was the absolute worst place I have ever stayed. Our "Non smoking" room reeked of cigarettes, the TV had one channel, the bed had NO blankets, and it was incredibly noisy with what I suspect are drug addicts coming and going all night long. The curtains in the room were 2 different lengths on the same window, and I wouldn't walk barefoot on the carpet. We paid $70 to stay at this dump. Never again will I stay at any Travelodge. Everything I brought into the room smelled and had to be washed. If I hadn't been so tired after driving for hours, I would have stayed elsewhere.
1 Do not stay here. This place is horrible. The room we had was dirty and had holes in the shower, a cracked sink.The lamp shade was dirty and the bed was very lumpy. Appearently the management has not been in their rooms.There is a coffee pot to make coffee but they only give you one of the clear plastic cups, the same one you get to rinse your month out after brushing. Needless to say that cup would melt. I asked why they dont give you a better cup and I was told I could come to the ofice and get a styrofoam cup. Why wuld I want to go the the office in the morning in my robe and slippers just to get a cup, it should already be in the room. The airconditioner was very noisy and so was the refrigator. We will never stay at a Travelodge or a travelodge suite ever again.  Take my advice and go some where else.
1 I would give it no stars if I could. They don't clean the rooms during your stay. They told us that they only clean them every 4 days. That is absolutely disgusting and should be a health violation. Needless to say, we ended up eating our costs and leaving early.   STAY AWAY, FAR AWAY!!!
