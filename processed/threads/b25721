3 Just your typical BK.
3 This location needs a little help. The drive through light was not on. Maybe it was broken but it appeared close at 7pm at night. There was a delay in anyone to take my order which was disappointing because when I pulled through the drive through no customers were placing orders inside or in the drive through. My food was cold including my frozen in the middle apple pie which I did have to drive back to the Resturant to have them fix it. The manager was nice and fixed my order right away.
5 It's so nice to have a fast food veggie burger option!! Please keep it on your menu. It was delicious!   I can't say much about the inside of this establishment since I went through the drive thru.   The drive thru service was fast!
3 Great people work here and never had bad service here.
