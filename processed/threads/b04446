1 I try not to have any regrets in life, but i regret not going to my normal place. My friend and I needed pedicures and quality girl time together.  This place was between her and my house and I found a coupon, so we went. There's nothing special about this place.  The same prices and services as every other nail salon in the grocery store plazas. My toes look really nice, except for the chunks of skin missing around my nails.  I don't really have much cuticle down there, so that may have been the problem.  Maybe she has a routine.   It hurts to walk.  4 of my toes have scabs surrounding my nails.  Last I checked, the cuticle only grows on the bottom.   I guess that's what I get for trying to save $2.
5 I have been coming to annies for three years. Never disappointed! I absolutley love the staff and they treat me like a friend! Anyone that doesn't like it should try it one more time! They are very fair priced too!
4 I like this place a lot. I see Lynn regularly. Great prices too.
