5 Scrubs N More Boutique is an awesome place to pick up work apparel and accessories.  The prices are fair and the customer service is great, just speak to Jeri the boutique manager and she will help you and give you direction.  I, myself have picked up a few sets of name brand scrubs 'Ecko' that I wear occassionally while working in my tattoo studio and my wife has also purchased items from this retail location consisting of designer purses, wallets and girly stuff accessories!  So when your in the San Tan Valley... please stop into the Scrubs N More and give them an opportunity to provide you with quality merchandise at affordable prices supported by priceless customer service and welcoming atmosphere.
5 Great place with so many things! Window shopping doesn't do it justice! Go in, you'll love it :)
5 I shop at the Fry's next door to this little boutique sometimes and my daughter always asks me to take her in here. It is filled with unique items of all kinds. We like the fun accessories, purses and such. But it is a place that you just have to wonder around because it is really a cool collection of awesome stuff, not just scrubs.
5 I love this place.  It's A LOT more than just scrubs.
1 Had an old review but I've moved on. Going to find other places to shop with more atmosphere and good vibes. Not feeling it here anymore.
5 Went into Scrubs N More Boutique on Aug 30th, 2012 and was very pleased with the kindness of the employees and the manager. At first I thought it would be just scrubs but boy was I wrong. They have so many cute things for hair, sunglasses, jewelry, purses, and much more. Go in and check out the place, you won't be disappointed.
