4 What a gem of a find. I pass by this place ton and from work each day so finally today I had time to check it out. The market has a restaurant attached that u can order food from. It's a small menu but all the classics are there. I ordered the Kefta kabob plate and a beef swarma. Both were very good. And the service was quick as well, while waiting for the food in browsed the market and bought som juice, pits chips and baklava also. If definitely come again.
4 Vegas has quite a few Mediterranean restaurants, but this is a hidden gem.  Although this is a supermarket with a small food court area and not an ideal place to spend an evening dining in, but the food are excellent. If you are looking for a good take out place with excellent tasty and healthy food, THIS IS IT !!!
1 Food is good, but customer service should be just as good. Very rude, not friendly makes you feel un welcome. Don't know how he stays in business. Will tell all people I know to never go there. Vegas is full of good markets and this is not one of them.
