5 Mario and SK Jewelry rock!  It's so nice to have a jewelry supply place close to downtown.   Every time I stop in to pick something up Mario has gotten something new.  They've added some new equipment for sale recently and said they will continue to add more.  Mario is very friendly and helpful and is always willing to order something in if he doesn't have it in stock.    The store is in a very convenient location, especially if you are taking jewelry classes downtown.  Stop in and check out what they have to offer.
5 I am taking my first jewelry class and stopped by SJ with a list of supplies and no idea as to what they were. Mario and the woman who was working (I can't remember her name now) walked me through the list and I was in and out of there within minutes. Super friendly and helpful.
4 The husband-wife owners were very helpful in locating the tools on my list. They thoroughly explained each and suggested some additional tools to make life (projects) easier, such as a tube holder for making accurate cuts! They did try to up sell me a work bench which I explained wouldn't work for me...they understood and overall they were very helpful, accommodating & acted like they actually cared! I'll definite be back.
5 They opened a few weeks after I started taking my first jewelry class. Since then, they are my best supplier.
5 This is a great store. They don't have a major selection of supplies, but they do have the items most people use on a regular basis. Plus they can get anything you need.  I did like there beautiful selection of good quality turquoise and other stones, like agates and jasper. I'm giving it a five star, if for nothing else they took the time with me, and answered all my questions. No pressure.
