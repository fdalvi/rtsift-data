1 Whatever Einstein Bros. serves, it is not a bagel.  Bagels are boiled, and Einstein serves up a round, puffy, baked roll with a hole in the middle.  No boiling involved, since that is time-consuming, i.e., expensive, and creates real bagels with a chewy consistency.  You might like their rolls, but they really shouldn't call them bagels.
2 This Einstein's has seen better days. We stopped here on a road trip to grab a bagel and coffee and it was dirty.  They only had one coffee available (Vanilla Hazelnut) so we we disappointed with that lack of selection.
2 I felt like I was bothering the employees here with my order. It took me making eye contact with three employees (one of whom was standing around) before anyone came over to take my order.
