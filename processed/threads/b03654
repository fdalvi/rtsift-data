4 Service counter clerks are very friendly and helpful.
5 I love this store!  Everyone is super helpful and nice.  They have the best products. The paint is high quality and I love that they carry metallic paint, hardly anyone carries it any more and most of our client love metallic finishes!
4 This is my first time actually purchasing the paint with Dunn-Edwards.  I have heard about this place through the painters that repainted our house few years ago that they purchased the paints through them.  If you do live in a Homeowner Association home(s), just provide your association name to them and most likely you will get some soft of a discounts on all the purchases.  Good luck!
4 Was immediately helped when I walked in.  Had my paint ready in 10 minutes. Got a discount for being in an HOA. Satisfied customer.
1 Over 200$ for a 5gallon bucket of exterior flat paint ?   I DO NOT think so.  Sorry.                   Last three times there my colors were off tint.  Had to return with poor service.  I'll shop Frazee now.    Sorry.  Dunn.
1 These guys make it very clear they don't like working with home owners. Short answers with an attitude is a typical Dunn Edwards response. Frazee is right down the road and they are fine working with contractors or home owners.
