5 We have lived here 7 years and really like it, nice & quiet!!
1 THIS PLACE IS A COCKROACH HAVEN!!  If you love having cockroaches in your bathroom, garage, front yard, kitchen and even at the pool live here!! This place should be condemned!!!!!
3 Nice employees.  Great maintenance team and nice pool.  Feels safe. Very manicured landscape. Units are overall clean.  Not sure why they have a clubhouse because you can't rent it out.   My unit sits above 3 garages and I hear them going up and down at 2am, 3am, 4am, and more.  Very hard to cool my unit down in the summer so I'm moving out.
2 So I went to go visit a bunch of properties in Vegas. From the outside, this property looks very nice. The Staff is friendly as well. However, once you step into the apartments, you know that this is an old property. Every apartment we went into had a weird smell. The appliances were outdated. I would suggest looking at other rental properties and paying a bit more. This property does however look very safe.
5 I love this apartment complex!  They have several layouts and mine is the two story townhouse. My husband and I searched long and hard but eventually we just came back to this one.   Located off the 215 and Flamingo, we are right behind the freeway but don't hear a thing. Dog friendly with lots of grassy areas and poop bags for dogs. Spacious for the cost with attached garages. Leading office and guard shack staff are courteous.   Never used the pools or the gym.   If we could buy our place, we would. We love it here!
