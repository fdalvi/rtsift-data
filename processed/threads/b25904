5 okay.  this store is one of my favs.  i love a lot of the stuff that is there.  i don't really get a lot in here but i love everything that i buy.  they are always super friendly and helpful.  they love to give me things to try on.  always have new things in the store!
4 I consider shopping a per diem job LOL ! This is a cute boutique with a   very friendly staff.  I have found a lot of cute outfits here and they have a lot of accessories to complement a look. I find it conveniently located if I don't feel like going to the mall and they also have thoughtful/ last minute gifts so I can get two errands done at one place !
5 This store is so cute. Always so organized & neat, and very reasonable prices. All of my garments from here have lasted for months through multiple wears, washings, & dry cleanings (which you can not always count on these days unless you pay high $) The woman who works mostly M-F during the day, I can't remember her name :( is so nice and helpful. Always informative regarding sales, etc. and I never feel pressured to buy things or spend $ I don't want to. Definitely check it out for cute, cheap (around $50 & below) dresses and darling accessories!
3 Super cute clothes a bit over priced.  They have a great selection of the latest trends in woman's/juniors apparel.   I went in on a day that they were having a sale. Everything in the store was 30% off. I ended up trying on a lot of options and buying only one due to the weird fit of majority of the options.   The phone was ringing off the hook and the only girl working seemed a little frantic. They need to have another person working, there was just too much going in for one person to be able to handle.   I might be back if I'm in the area... but I won't go out of my way to come back.
