5 Any store that has a black cat as the store cat has to be cool and this is no exception The owner here is a fabulous man really. For my Mom sewing is her life she is older and is losing her sight and the remaining sight she has she loves to sew and he really understood. He is a very busy guy he treats me and my 30  buck repair as important as a sale of a 1000 buck machine. Many times My mom has brought in her machine and he has fixed something for a very minimal charge ...ok people they just don't do that anymore. This guy is a swell person he just is period!       Product wise he also has a nice line of green products to clean, sprinkle absorbs smells/odors from cats. I bought the powder made from spices and herbs to sprinkle on the carpet. I am tired of the stuff with all the chemicals and this one I could recognize all the ingredients. M an R also sells cool vacuums and when I am in the market I will be going here because this man can fix stuff I will not be going to a box store where you have to end up getting a brand that is mostly plastic and breaks. He sells more upscale European brands and really the prices are really good. He also sells reconditioned vacuums he has fixed. Some of those older ones are the really good ones that can survive a nuclear blast.      So if Mom or Grandma has a sewing machine that needs to be fixed come here..they sell new amazing machines Bernina Babylock they have classes here too! Great gift for someone to give them a class :) I would buy a machine or a vacuums from this guy because he is a HONEST man hard to find in this day and age. He is not out for the buck he helps people with good service and advice on their machines.. I myself work in sales and I really have an eye for liars. I just do not like them. This guy I like he is a good person.  Go visit the cat his name is Oliver :)
5 ******NOTE ******* GOOGLE Map Location WRONG *********  This store is a little tricky to find and the google map information is wrong.  It has been reported but no correction made.  This store is located in a small strip mall on the south side of Odana, at the T intersection of Research Park Blvd.  It is west of Pink Poodle and east of Odana Antique mall.  It shares a lot with the Nile Restaurant.  Sells Bernina and Baby Lock machines.  Staff helpful.
5 This is based solely on a phone call. My sewing machine was acting up and needed it fixed ASAP. I called and spoke with a woman who said they were booked out until the end of June (a little over a month away) for cleaning and tune-ups. However, she gave me a few troubleshooting tips and explained what to look for that might be causing the problem. She was very patient and informative and I truly appreciated her kindness. Plus, it saved me a little cash and time! Will definitely be using them in the future.
5 M&R is a very busy little repair shop that does excellent work for a fair price.  They are extremely helpful and will even troubleshoot basic issues at no charge or for a very small fee.  I had problems with the thread tension on my machine after a broken needle.  I brought the machine in and announced that I thought I needed service.   I was upset to hear that they were booking out into end of October for real, benchtop, open-machine service repairs.  However, they said, "Bring it in, let's have a look at it."  Well, after 10 minutes in their able hands, they fixed the problem right on the front desk.  Any problems that had to do with quirks of the machine, threading issues, worn-out parts, or maintenance, at least they can address those immediately.  I was sent away with a working machine at no charge.  So, if you have a real problem and need a full-on repair, there will be a wait.  But bring your machine in and see if they can help with the basic stuff, they are very friendly and helpful.  A nice selection of Babylock and Bernina machines, thread, and helpful service and repair.  Call to schedule a regular tune-up and avoid the kind of problem I had. :P a great little shop with lots to recommend it.
