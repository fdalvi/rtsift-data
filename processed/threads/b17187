4 I know I'm gonna love a place when I hear upon entering, "Hello there honey, how ya'll doin?" LOVE YOU LADY BEHIND COUNTER. LOVE YOU! I mean how fun can it be to work at a light bulb store. Apparently big fun, cuz everyone there is very friendly and helpful. As I'm waiting for her to look up the part I need for my track light (I know, track lighting, how very 80s of me and how very gay) I'm overwhelmed by how many choices we as American consumers have in the light bulb world. You might say a light bulb went off in my head. WOW! Different shapes, colors, sizes, wattages, volts....lions and tigers and bears oh my! I really do highly recommend this business. Family owned and right now I feel like their favorite cousin. You know like Oliver on the Brady Bunch. Whatever happend to Oliver? Hmmm...he'll probably show up on Celebrity Fit Club. And scene...
5 No one had a fluorescent light bulb for our store and they did. Thx you saved me from ordering online.
4 Very knowledgeable staff with interesting and diverse inventory.
5 Went in there with a fixture I purchased almost a year ago that failed. Fully intended to buy a new one. The kind lady at the counter said it should have lasted longer than that and gave me a new one. No receipt or nothing. ( I did buy it there). That kind of service will keep me going there for any of my lighting needs. You just don't find that kind of service anymore. Except my store.
