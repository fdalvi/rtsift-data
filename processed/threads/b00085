1 The prices are outrageous.  I went in to mail an 5x8" envelope with a few CDs in it.  They told me it would be $16.95.  I went to the post office:  $4.95.    Don't bother unless you like shelling out a few extra bones.
5 We've were in between houses this summer and used the Sun Prairie UPS Store's mailbox for our mail and package deliveries.  I couldn't be more impressed with the staff.  They were always very professional and willing to help out.  As to the reviewer complaining about the shipping prices, UPS prices will always be higher than the post office.  Unless you ship in volume and can negotiate business prices with UPS, they are not the most economical.  However I have far more trust in UPS being able to deliver a package safely and when they say they will than USPS.
5 These guys are great!  Fast, friendly service and all you need for shipping, printing and more.  Yeah the post office is cheaper on some stuff, but I like the idea of my stuff getting to where it's supposed to on time :-)   Chuck and his staff are great.  Highly recommend
