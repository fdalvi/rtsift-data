4 Last night Arcadia Fine Wine (where I work) held an event at the Sub-Zero Wolf Showroom in Scottsdale and it went spectacularly. I'm a renter, and I'm poor, so I'd never been into the SZW showroom. The event was for about 40 people and the team at SZW was really helpful, setting up the tables, adding flowers and other decorations around the showroom, and even baking cranberry-oatmeal cookies and chocolate mini-cupcakes with cream cheese frosting for our guests. The demo kitchen is the sexiest kitchen I've ever seen - rich woods, caramel colored granite, gorgeous wolf equipment of course, and the world's biggest island is on a raised platform with 3 cameras over each of the three stovetops that broadcast onto 3 huge plasma tvs above the set. All of the showroom's kitchens are functional, which was great for the competitors to be able to a little prep before taking the stage.   I don't know if SZW rents this space out but it seems like a fantastic party spot. I want to do Iron Chef competitions every month just so I can hang out there. And of course if you need kitchen appliances you can't beat this spot and their warm and helpful staff.
5 We needed a new Sub-Zero so we went to their Scottsdale  showroom.  Sub-Zero makes great products, the showroom is an easy place to find stuff out, and the people in are friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.  The showroom doesn't sell anything, so the people just concentrate on showing you and telling you about the various Sub-Zero models.   We looked at a bunch of models, asked lots of questions and no one tried to sell us anything. They just gave us a list of dealers.
