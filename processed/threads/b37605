5 This place is new and very clean. All the employees are very professional and friendly. The prices can't be beat. I got a pedicure with salt and the paraffin wax for only $35!!! Excellent service!
4 I really love my acrylic/gel mani!! They have lasted really well considering I work in food. The staff is nice & do amazing work. Only issue I have is that the gel polish selection isn't that big. BUT I Will definitely be returning soon! Just a tip bring cash. (:
