4 Annette was very helpful with the carpet picking process. Let me take home samples and take my time. She came over and measured the two rooms perfectly so that I wouldn't pay for any extra carpet. Scheduling was as planned and Alan came over and did a professional  job of the installation.  A little vague on how my bill was figured, but you will get a better price here than most of those big name outlets. I would use Carpet Corner again in the future. Would like to try them on a tile job.
1 Stay away! This company burned a family member of mine real bad. The sub contractor they used did a bad job (gaps,small holes) on tile and Carpet Corner refused to step in and take responsibility. Ask yourself, is this a company I want to do business with? Carpet Corner viewed photos and even listened to a recording of the sub contractor being aggressive about the claims of bad work. AND still wouldn't do the right thing. Again, stay away!
5 I had an extremely pleasant experience with Carpet Corner. Annette showed us a ton of samples in the store and let us take our favorites home. She was extremely knowledgeable about all types of carpets and wasn't pushy when we wanted to stick to a strict budget. The carpet was installed on the day we were promised. Yes, they use a sub contractor but we had no issues with that. They came within the time frame they said they would and were in and out within a couple hours. (However, we did only have two rooms done) The carpet prices and installation were all very reasonable and less than we had been quoted with other places, especially for good quality carpet! I have nothing bad to say about this place and would definitely recommend to anyone!
