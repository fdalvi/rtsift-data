5 My wife and I try every sauce we find and so far Sting N Linger is the best store salsa/sauce yet. You can find it at Fry's food stores. After trying it, it was all we would buy except for testing new stuff.  I discovered it was made just a mile from my house in Tempe. I went there and bought all their products. We can't wait to have a salsa tasting! I have lived in AZ for over 50 years speak Spanish and lived in Mexico during a lot of summers. I make home made salsa so I know what the good stuff tastes like.
5 The real deal. Luckily they sell their salsa at AJs up by my house. It is the only salsa I have tried that is truly hot. Thank you for making such a great product. I have searched far and wide for you after trying the ghost pepper salsa at Canteen on Mill in Tempe.
