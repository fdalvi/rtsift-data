4 The people that own this boutique are so helpful! One of my customers told me about this place and I just had to check it out.   I have a breed of dog that is very hard to fit for collars and such. I rarely drive too far out of my CenPho neighborhood but I was on a mission. While  the store owner and I were pouring over her massive inventory of beautifully embellished pet collars, she asked me why I did not bring my "diva" in with me so she could fit her for some new bling. I explained that since getting my new dog, the two girls riding in the car were driving me crazy and it just wasn't save.  "Do I have the thing for you" she exclaimed. I am now the proud owner of what I feel is the best pet item ever invented. In my back seat you will now find a "Look Out" doggie car seat. I know, sounds completely crazy but this thing works great. I can now travel around town with my beauties safe and secure as well as happy as can be to go for a ride with me.  The darn thing is even pretty stylish.   This is such a surprisingly practical purchase and I owe it all to Diva Dogs boutique. All you Yelpers who love to have your doggies on the go with you need to check this place out!
4 The diva's who run this place are worth a visit by the guys just to have a look.  Can't comment on the stuff for sale as I wasn't shopping.  I took my lab there for grooming and they did a good job.  She was roaming freely around the shop and quite comfortable.  I take this as a sign that she was well treated as she is a moody beast!  I'll be back!
