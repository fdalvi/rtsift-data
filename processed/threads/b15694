5 I bought a new house in March and was starting over with furniture and everything....'blank slate' so to speak and Liz consulted with me on my vision for the place. With my ideas and her eye for color, design and detail we were able to achieve great results. She has a stable of VERY talented folks that do blinds, curtains, shutters, paint etc. and she has a great eye! Thanks Liz!
