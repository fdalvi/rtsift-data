1 Horrible, horrible service!!! Bad attitude rude BH there yesterday at 6:30pm!! Thank goodness we don't live near this location! I would go off on the corporate office!!
3 I can't say much about this location, we order at the drive-thru, so I didn't experience the inside of the place.  At home, we have an old TV set that doesn't get any of the "regular" channels, my kids watch cartoons either on Netflix or DVDs, and us, we watch stuff on Netflix or Hulu. Well, on hulu they repeat commercials over and over again. And one of those commercials they've been repeating is the Jack In The Box's "Hot Mess", and I love it!! I'm always singing the song!! So I had to get me a Hot Mess Sandwich!!! The Sandwich was ok, not too bad, I like the spice and acidity from the jalape√±os, but that's about it. It is fast food, right!?  Can't expect a boutique burger, can you?
1 Just stopped here. Zero customers, food took forever. Cold fries. Filthy restrooms with no paper towels. No napkins in main lobby.  Biscuit was good though. My boyfriend wanted me to add that.
1 I just went threw the drive threw the people didn't get our order right, then the manager was arguing with us. Won't come back here!
