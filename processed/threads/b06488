3 This is probably the third time that they have forgotten to put something in my bag. The first time I didn't check and I drove all the way home and found out that I was missing a burger. Today I went and I went through the drive thru to order food for my brothers and sister and I had to wait in front of the restaurant....which was just fine. However, I checked the bags when I got them and I did a double check and a triple check. Yep, I was missing a burger....and then I checked my receipt to make sure it was on there. Yep, still missing a burger. I had to get my lazy butt out of the car (hence that is why I was going through the drive thru) and walk inside the store. They were very accommodating and I needed that burger with 3 teenage boys and a growing girl....I needed all the food that I ordered. Overall, food is ok for a fast food joint.
3 Location is close to work, so been here a couple of times, for both dine-in and drive-thru.  Service is good.  Food quality is good.  Nothing wrong with my orders so far.  Happy with this location and would go again, as long as I'm in the mood for their fast food.  Since trying their iced coffees, I like them better than McDonald's...they are sweeter and have better flavor!
2 Before our move to Vegas and the experience of eating a six dollar burger, the "WHOPPER" was the best burger we'd eat. Maybe it was a limited choice, but it was one we, my husband and I enjoyed regularly.   So going back to Burger King and trying the whopper after a few years of having skipped them, was a bit disappointing! I don't know if it was the late night order, we went around 8oclock at night, or they have lost some of their flavor.   The bun was dried out, the burger had no flavor, and the best thing about the meal was the french fries. I know that consistency plays a big role in any fast food place, but I don't know if I want to try again, I was that disappointed.
