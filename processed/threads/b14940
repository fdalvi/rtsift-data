5 This is a great place to wash your car.  It is credit/debit card friendly.  This place is super clean and provides the guests with many options in the bays.  You can't beat the pricing here too.  The owner is super nice and cares about his business, guests, appearance and machines.  I have never had a bad experience and the machines operate like they are brand new.  No glitches or faulty machines which is a huge plus.
5 This carwash is the Best I have run across. I am a finatic when it comes to having a clean car. I go to the car wash not once or twice a week but once or twice a day. The owner is very personable and helpful. He takes the time to get to know the people who stop in. I would probably own stock in floor mats if he had not noticed the many many times I forgot my mats and put them aside for me. Everything is always working and works well. I want to say thanks for the wonderful business you have.
5 Things we all look for in a "do-it-yourself-carwash"  Feeling of Safety? - Check New equipment? - Check Accepts Credit/Debit Card - Check The foam in the brush comes out generously? - Check   All in all, a solid car wash.
5 Stopped by for a quick rinse and vacuum.  Everything was clean and organized and actually worked (even the change machine - miracle!).  Not overcrowded, even during peak hours.  Convenient.
