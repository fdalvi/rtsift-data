4 Don't let the simple exterior of the business fool you, this place is huge and very cool.  I had no idea when I walked in how big it was, nor the scope of inventory they provide.  To say this is a billiard store is an understatement.  They sell billiard tables and supplies yes, but they also sell tons of cool furniture, man cave items, unique furniture, video and arcade games, pinball machines and a huge selection of dart boards and accessories.  I really didn't get to spend much time there, but will be back one afternoon, as it will take some time to see it all.
5 I am very pleased with my experience with Billiards N More.  I was looking for a hard-to-find video arcade game for my girlfriend as a Christmas present.  I contacted the store and was referred to the owner, Craig S.  Craig was pleasant, helpful and found exactly what I was looking for.  His price was reasonable, and he even arranged delivery on Christmas Eve!  I would recommend Billiards N More to anyone looking for a pool table, arcade game, or cool furniture & art.
1 As a pinball enthusiast I was thrilled to find out that this location has a substantial collection to offer here in the Las Vegas valley. That was right up until I found them spamming Craig's list and the prices they put on these machines.  I own several pin ball machines. I enjoy shopping for additional ones. However it's almost like this location feels there machines are brand new straight from the factory mint condition pieces worth far more than their standard open market value. I would highly recommend to anyone looking to purchase a pinball machine look else ware first to save themselves thousands of dollars.
