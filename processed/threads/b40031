4 Stopped into this recently opened Subway this morning to give them a try.  I went with a cup of Chicken Noodle Soup & a 12" Steak & Cheese Sub on an Italian Herbs & Cheese roll.  My friendly sandwich artist "TK" toasted the bread along with the meat, Pepper Jack Cheese, red onions & bell pepper, after which I had him add a host of other goodies including Chipotle Sauce, fresh spinach, Greek Pepper slices, olives, tomato slices & more.  I do wish they had booths here but what a big, terrific feast this lunch was!  With the whole shebang costing only $7.29 it easily beat the good lunch I had down the street at Blimpie the other day, and this one ended up nipping at 5 Stars!     :-))
4 Thus place is very clean! Good seating, and very friendly and efficient staff! Have to say thus subway should be an example on how they should be ran! Definitely will go back again!
4 First and foremost the this subway, at lest when I was here, had wonderful service. Very friendly and helpful.    Like most subways they had many choices of bread, meats, cheeses and vegetables.  Not to mention the many types of sauce one has to choose from. To top it off they even have pizza.   Every was fresh, no little fly's buzzing around. Everything was clean.
