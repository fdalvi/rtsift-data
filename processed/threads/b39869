5 I have been doing my hair with Jessica for the past two years.  She always takes her time and knows what i like.  She understand how special I am with my hair and is sensitive to my needs.  Jessica is the only person I trust with my hair!!! Hair cuts, dye and style.  Not only did Jessica do my hair she also did my mom, sister and friends.  I highly recommend Jessica for all your needs!!!
5 I'm very picky on who touches my hair. I fully trust her with my hair!  I'm the kind of girl who has no idea What she wants and just expects the stylist to read my mind. Jessica works with me and helps me articulate what I picture in my head.  She is amazing.
5 JESSICA IS AMAZING AT WHAT SHE DOES!!!  I got my hair done for my wedding by Jessica at the recommendation of my best friend! Jessica came to my house to do a trial run and was so sweet, took her time and really listened to what I wanted and put up several different styles to get an idea. (Doing wedding hair? Make sure you do the trial. So worth the extra money to make sure you get what you're looking for) When it came time for wedding day she knew EXACTLY what to do! My hair was absolutely BEAUTIFUL and actual stayed put for the duration of my wedding.... Even after the car ride in a convertible from ceremony to reception! AWESOME! Totally highly recommend Jessica if you want someone who is wonderful, sweet and talented. She's your gal. Thanks Jessica for a job well done. YOU ROCK! :)
