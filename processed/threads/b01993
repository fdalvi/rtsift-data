5 After moving into this neighborhood two years ago I began to use this barber shop. It truly is one of the best ones I have been to. The treatment is top notch and the cuts are great.
4 Had a very good experience. Attention to detail.
1 Do not come here if you need a fade, tried telling the barber who also happens to be the owner what I wanted, but he didn't know what to do and when I asked him to fix it he seemed unwilling and annoyed.  Might of just gone to great clips if I wanted a crappy hair cut.
5 If you're looking for a real QUALITY BARBER come here and see my man Boris.  He's a Russian dude with a great personality that will indeed give you a great cut.  I've been a regular of his for several years now and he always takes care of me, he always goes above and beyond your basic cut... Have him trim your eyebrows (both of them, lol) and your beard if you're sporting one.  Boris is the real deal, he know's what he's doing!  Call ahead, sometimes he gets busy but he'll fit you in.  p.s. - Tell him Josh sent you
5 Best experience I have had. I've spent soc years looking for a barber that not only provided the level of service i needed, but one that had the "barber shop" feel to it. Every time I would find one, the barber would transfer elsewhere, but then I found this one. Walking in after work, Boris took me in and gave me a cut. I wasn't expecting the hot towel, straight edge, or even to like my cut (been so desensitized by Supercuts), but it's safe to say that I'll call this "home" and come for as long as they have an "open" sign.
