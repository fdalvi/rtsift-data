3 Coffee was crack in a cup but nasty tasting. The grand slam was half the taste of Denny's and the cakes were half the size . The service was excellent. Thanks Brandon.
4 Very good battered dipped fish, cole slaw bland, fries came barely warm. Service is fast for crowd, very nice and friendly staff. I'll go back for the fried cod. Did have to exchange coffee cup. It had some funk dried and stuck to the inside wall.
