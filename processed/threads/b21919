4 I went into this Savers when it first opened on the West side and was not impressed.  It looked like Kmart did in its last days - complete unorganized chaos.    But I gave it another chance a few days ago and I could not believe how much it improved.  It was neat and clean, and packed full of gently-used and totally reusable things.  Movies, CDs, picture and poster frames, furniture, small appliances, tons of dishes and fun kitchen stuff, rows of shoes, jewelry, and lots and lots of clothes.  Prices seemed very reasonable: I got 2 funny "Don Ho" glasses from Vegas for 69 cents a piece, an awesome bracelet for 2.99, and a Rowenta iron in really good shape for only five bucks.    I like to hunt for treasures and this is definitely my new place to do it.
4 I'm torn between giving this three stars or four, but I'll go with four because I pretty much always find something here. The prices are decent - but even better on whatever tag sale day it is... I can spend hours browsing through the store, but not for lack of organization, just because there is so much stuff!  I love the shelves of home odds and ends - so fun!
4 The prices are a little higher here, but I found a Banana Republic shirt in great condition for $7--that's a good deal.  Tons of stuff for kids, tons of shoes, lots to dig through.  I got a lot of stuff for my money, and if you donate clothes here, you get a 20% off coupon to use!  This place gets my recommendation.
4 What a great thrift store. Super friendly service. The gal who checked out my sale didn't mind wrapping up the 30+ plates I bought and was very genuine in her kindness while making small talk. Prices are the same as the East side location (aka: very reasonable). Thrifteriffic!
2 Savers is barely a one star thrift store,  but they have a friendly staff so I had to add a second star.   Why only one star for the store? As a life-long thrift shopper, I barely consider this a thrift store. Their prices are way, way too high. Some examples:  Curtains, nothing special, in good shape - $9.99 Franco Sarto sandals, fair condition - $17.99 Doormat, woven - $9.99 Queen-size comforter - $19.99 Merona (Target brand) ballet flats - $8.99  Are you kidding me? And the stuff is nothing special, it's your typical thrift store stuff... so why the high prices? Every once in a while I stop in to see if they've changed, and I leave without buying anything. You'd be better off going across the street to West Towne Mall and shopping the sales if you want to spend that kind of money.  I'll be over at Goodwill or St. Vinny's...
