5 My father was in the hospital with a major stroke. I drove out from san diego with very little money to try and handle his affairs. I needed one document notarized to access his birth certificate, and also a durable power of attorney.       As my father was incapacitated, a mobile notary was the only option. I googled  moble notaries. Sand Dollar was the first one I called. It was 7:20 pm, so I was doubtful someone would answer. To my surprise, I was answered by a pleasant voice (The Owner).      I made an appointment for the following day. She arrived promptly, with the neccessary documents.       She was knowledgeable, helpful, friendly, thorough and quick! And yet, the notarization of two documents, one of which she provided, only cost me $40.00.       If you need a mobile notary in Las Vegas, Do yourself a favor. Call Sand Dollar Mobile Notary.
5 My brother in law was in the hospital and needed a document notarized. I called about 4 other places before I reached Tandy. She was very polite on the phone and available to be at the hospital within 30mins. It was quick and painless. Notary is $10 but $20 for traveling. A little steep but when you're desperate...you're desperate. Everything was done and she was on her way.
5 Very professional mobile notary service.  Even in the evening, she was punctual and very affordable.  Would definitely use them again.
5 Tandi of Sand Dollar Mobile Notary was awesome to work with. I called on Friday, she was able to meet on Saturday, and she was very nice and very professional while I explained the advanced directive paperwork to my grandpa. Will definitely be using her services again whenever I need a document notarized!
