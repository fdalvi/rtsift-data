5 I ordered flowers from Monica Higgins over the phone. Couldn't have been happier. Great service, beautiful flowers, my sister was very happy!
5 This is a truly brilliant florist. Not just because they seem to have the best, most interesting displays (which they do, if worth going just to look in the window), but because they are so friendly and helpful.  Now I don't know the first thing about flowers. But I wanted to treat my then lady partner (because I'm nice like that), and I wanted to get flowers that were better than the ones in supermarkets. So I came here. They made up a really nice bouquet for me, which at Â£15 wasn't overly expensive. And trust me, it went down a treat.   In fact, I was so impressed that I went back a few weeks later to get a bunch of lilies (I know, I know, I'm too nice). After a week they hadn't opened, so I took then back. They didn't even question our flower maintaining ability, just immediately offered either a fresh bunch or a full refund. Great service, great florist.
