2 After I had a fair good year with them, they messed it up!. I requested a new quote for only ONLY 6 months, yet they sent their new papers for 1 year. It was impossible to cancel the service without bureaucracy, and after 5 days I was able to finally send my signed letter so they would cancel the policy. Recently I received a new letter, where on top of being charged a higher month payment for the first month...I have a balance due company of 12 more bucks! HA, out of the blue!!  RUN AWAY from companies where you can't cancel as fast as log into your internet account in 5 minutes.
3 I like Bristol West! They offer a fair policy at a fair price. They tend to insure people that have driving record problems. Their fees are a bit higher then some but they earn it in the extra service they offer. If you have a good agent then BW will be a good fit for you. Your Agent should help you with any problems.
1 i mever write any reviews but i felt the needs to do this in order to warn others. DONT USE BRISTOL WEST!!!!!!!!!!!! i filed a claim but they switched my adjustor without notifying me first, then she gave my case back to the first guy wo telling me again. no one responded to my calls or had any info i provided about 5times. when adjustor finally called, he made an extremely racist comment against my ethnicity and when i called him out, he raised his voice and responded with bad bad attitude, icouldnt be more shocked!!!!! his name is brian cargile fyi. dont use this company, they are rude, unprofessional, and apprently has 'no way to make any complaints'.
