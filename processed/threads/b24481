4 This review is for their amazing jeans. I love their fit, feel and designs. They also handle any alterations you may need through the store. I always find it very hard to find good jeans but this problem may be solved permanently with the discovery of 7 For All Mankind! I am very happy with my purchases and the alterations. Highly recommend.
4 My friend and I stopped in here after I saw a great purple shirt on display.  Fun store, and here comes the hook....they were serving mimosas, scones, cupcakes.  I had the refreshing mimosa.  I didn't end up getting the shirt due to the price, however, they offered us a traveller on another mimosa.  Impressed, nice touch 7 for all Mankind staff.
5 It was my second time here at this location and both times were great. I was on their website looking at new fits and I called this store and had the pleasure of talking to Andrew. He informed me of an event they were having and asked what styles and size I wear. I went in an hour later and was greeted by Andrew and Kate. Andrew had already pulled the two styles I requested in my size and in multiple washes.he grabbed me a beer and I looked around a bit more before moving to the fitting room. Both Kate and Andrew were friendly and attentive and eagerly offered their opinions when asked and weren't pushy at all. I walked out with a pair of their new Luxe Performance jeans and a button down.  Very happy customer!
