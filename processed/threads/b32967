2 This place is a tad bit expensive for my taste and the service could be better.
5 Conveniently right near my house and next to my gym. The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable. Clean beds. Be sure to check out groupon because they have specials deals there too!
5 Perfect location with many different tanning beds to choose from so you don't have to keep doing the same thing! Staff is very friendly and holds a clean, newly remodeled store! Definitely recommend to a friend!
4 Favorite body heat salon to tan at. Plus the girls here are actually nice and not obnoxiously rude like some of the other locations
5 This is the closest bodyheat to my house , been going to body heat for years . This is probably my favorite location. The girls are so sweet and it's always clean . For the most part I'm in and out with the exception that there's been a few times that I've had to wait but sometimes it gets a little more packed the usual especially when they run specials !
