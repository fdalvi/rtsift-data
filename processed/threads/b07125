4 I love Kohls!!!!!!!!  They will take anything back, no matter when you bought it, how much it is, and even without a receipt, NO PROBLEM!!!!!!!!!   They send out 20 & 30% off coupons all the time so I never pay full price for anything and usually the item I want is on sale anyway so with the discount it's win/win!   And it has stores all over the place for convenience.  I may not be able to find EVERYTHING I want there but pretty darn close.   I just wish they figure out that they need to offer people an incentive to go and fill out their customer survey like Walgreens and Pennys does.  They also give discounts to seniors!
4 You have saved five million dollars today! ok, ok... right now they seem to be saving my butt lately as my children are growing 2" every week.   If I use my Kohl's charge card, coupon's, Kohl's cash, it seems like a good deal... but I wonder how this all works with their mark up's.   I will thank them profusely for having snow pants yet in December when most of the other stores are already out.  (Hate that retail stores do this-  Try looking for gloves in February!) The past year it seems like their fashion lines have stepped it up a notch, customer service has been peppy, so I'll be back next week, I'm sure.
