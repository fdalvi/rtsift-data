4 I love the steak and egg specials here.  They also have pretty good fries.  It's a good deal and I think you get what you pay for.  You can never go wrong with cheap steak and eggs.  The servers are pretty chill.  The environment is a little rundown, and old-fashioned.  Once you enter the building, there's a distinct smell, but it goes away once you're in the dining area.  Other than that, I don't mind going here with friends.  It's just a little far from my house.  ^_^
3 Alright so no smoke and mirrors here, it's pretty much straight forward.  The steak dinner/steak and egg special for around $6.  It used to be around $5 but it has gone up in the last couple of months.  That's about the only thing I go here for.  The staff is nice and the surroundings are nothing to write home about.  But if your in the neighborhood and you wanted some steak for a good price you might want to stop by and check it out.
4 Steak & Eggs special $5.99..I think YES!   This is not my neck of the woods normally. An awesome pal of mine took me here at 3am for breakfast after a night of boozing it up.   Steak and eggs special is incredible. A generous slab of steak, two eggs, hash browns and toast or pancakes.   The pancakes were from scratch two plate sized flat fluffy pillows of goodness! Melted butter and hot syrup.   I was sitting there moaning for a good 45 minutes while I enjoyed every morsel. $5.99 for a ton of food! I was defeated, for the first time in history I was unable to finish my entire meal!   The service was Amazing. Shout out to Bobby! Who was a real Gem! He treated me like a Queen!   We chose to eat at the bar and enjoy our meal, they also have a sit down cafe/restaurant with full service open 24/7.   I will be back for one of the best breakfast meals I have had in Las Vegas!
