5 Lovely pub in a beautiful setting on the side of the Water of Leith. Relaxing atmosphere and a good menu too. Smart.
4 Friendly, helpful staff. They were 1 of the 10 pubs on a pubcrawl from World's End Pub on the Royal Mile, and coming all the way out to Leith seemed a bit much so I could get a stamp that would lead to a T-shirt. Nonetheless, The Waterline is a cozy, warm place, combining a modern feel with an ancient building with lots of light in the front and brown wood interior in the back. Also love the Biergarten, a la Germany. Ale selection was less than I'd hoped for, though they did have good Scottish ale.
