2 Very slow service. Food is typical for BK.
3 It's a Burger King like any other.  I prefer their reheated "flame broiled" burgers over McD's.  It's serves it's purpose and it's on our way from Big League Dreams to the US60.
2 Brand new remodel. Unfortunately they didn't renovate what needed it most, the employees! Service is awkward and very slow. "Mgr" just walked into the restroom with his food prep apron on. Nice.
2 If you have time to kill, you will be just fine...employees at this joint are not, I repeat ARE NOT, going to break thier neck to help you, take your order, etc.  They are getting paid by the hour and making it real obvious...but anyway brand new remodel so it looks snazzy, and food wise got exactly what I ordered and how I wanted it...when I finally got it...
1 Nothings changed here. Walked up to order breakfast, and the "manager" and crew members just ignored me. Guess why? They were discussing how to increase sales! Priceless.
1 This is the worst Burger King I been to! They served old overcooked French fries and the fish burger was old, lettuce old!! Yuk!!
2 This place is a go-to for me on days I can't get out of work on time to go home for lunch. The 2 stars are for the insta-shits I got after eating a mostly mediocre whopper with cheese today. In all seriousness, beware. It was no bueno.
