5 I went to discuss some Immigration information with Andrew, He was  professional and informative. In the area of Immigration you need to have assistance with someone who is keeping up with what is going on in a constantly changing environment .  I recommend this practice highly.
5 My wife and I worked with Andrew to complete her petition for permanent resident status.  His expert knowledge and helpful attitude made this complicated process much more bearable.  Although it is possible for someone to read the USCIS rules, complete the required documents, and submit them, I'd highly recommend meeting with Andrew because this area of the law changes quickly and his expert assistance will minimize the chance of delays or issues.  I highly recommend his office and his services.
4 Very thorough consultation, answered all our questions, worth the $100
