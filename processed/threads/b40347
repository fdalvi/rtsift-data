5 I've been going to Christi for many months now for eyelash extensions and I love her work! Her prices are very reasonable and I am constantly getting compliments on how glamorous my lashes look. She listens to what her customers want and constantly checks in to make sure you're happy with her work. I recommend her to all my family and friends that are looking for eyelash extensions. If you are looking for quality work, Christi is your girl!

5 I can't believe it has taken me so long to write a review! I have been going to Christy for several months to get eyelash extensions and she is amazing. Lately my skin has been driving me crazy. It has been red, itchy, and super dry. I decided to get a facial and holy cow I am glad I did! That was the best facial I have ever had by far. It was so relaxing, my skin looks and feels amazing, and I just felt so pampered. Christy is so nice and loves what she does, I can not wait to get another facial!
