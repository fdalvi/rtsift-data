5 I've been coming here go over a year now and am so excited to leave Zuccos a review. I've never had a more enjoyable time getting my haircut, and Paul genuinely cares about me and what's been going on in my life.  I feel like he's a close friend that I see every few weeks and can always pick up where we left off.  And even though I live 20 miles away, I'll always make time to drive across town to my favorite salon/barber in the valley!
3 3 stars is A-OK.  Great styling but at $21 plus tip ends up being a $25 venture.  As he claims "The Best haircut you'll ever get" Despite what the sign outside says, you will need an appointment
5 Had my hair cut and colored by Mary and I couldn't be happier.
