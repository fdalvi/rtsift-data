5 It takes along time to get a haircut but it is worth the wait.  The barbers do a good job and they listen to what you want. I bring my sons here because they leave with a nice cut
5 Gabe is worth the wait! He's the best.. The TVs all work and they're always playing a good funny action packed movie! Not to mention how friendly everyone is! I won't be going anywhere anytime soon. Unless all my hair falls off!
5 I accompanied my husband to Elite Barber Shop on a Sunday morning. We called before we left the house, just to make sure they didn't have super long waiting times. So far so good. When we got there, there was only one other person getting a hair cut.  Inside, they have TVs and seating for people to wait. There are also two pool tables in the middle of the room.   We probably waited about 5 or 6 minutes before this gal called my husband. She did a great job talking to us and making sure she knew what we wanted out of this cut. We wanted fading in the back and I think she did a great job.  I posted a picture with their pricing, but they also have specials on certain weekdays and a check in offer of $2 off.
