3 Nice as it gets, but the rewards suck at harrahs properties.  Good, fair service.
5 Being the VIP WE ARE!!!!! 4-6pm hot food served on Fri & Sat!  Always great service with a :)  Diamond players get + 1   7 stars get + 3 I think....  Just make sure u tip generously...
4 Maybe not as large as the Diamond lounge at Caesar's, but they have the standard fare here.  You can snack on veggie sticks with dip, buffalo wings, salsa/chips, nuts, and meatballs. There is also a dessert tray if you prefer sweets.  Their distinguishing feature is that they serve seasonal cocktails that make your boozing a bit more interesting.  The small size of the lounge makes it a bit more cozy and service tends to be better as you will definitely not go unnoticed by the staff.
