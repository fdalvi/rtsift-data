4 I like this HMV. Its cosy. If you avoid weekends you can get parked right outside. They have a good stock of DVD's games and CD's, but watch out for the game prices. I've found that its worth comparing prices with the Game shop along the road. There's normally a price war and you need to be the winner. They only have a small book stock here and the NME on the counter never seems the current week. Again with the sale stuff, compare prices on the HMV online site, sometimes the shop is cheaper must mostly its the oline shop. I have had a few cracking bargains though.
