4 Awesome pet boutique- every dog's dream!  They have every luxury item imaginable in this store- all for your dog!  There are beds and toys shaped like convertible cars, clothing and accessories, jeweled collars and leashes, fresh doggie treats, knick knacks and more!  Your dog will be in heaven!  The staff was awesome as well!  Very nice people!
5 When I have a chance to come to Las Vegas for vacationing I really enjoy shopping for my dog at Lush Puppy.  It's hard to find clothes for my dog at other pet stores since she is about 75 lbs and a rottweiller & border collie mix.  But at Lush Puppy I always find cute tank shirts for her that fit.  They have absolutely adorable items for your pets.  If  you are a dog or cat lover I do recommend to stop in this store and take a look for yourself.  The customer service is nice and friendly.
3 Cute place but not much for my big dogs.  Everything seemed to be geared towards smaller dogs.  Not a big selection but what they did have was pretty cute.
