5 I found Jayeness (Jim Moloney) when searching for someone to remove the 1980's acoustic popcorn from the 18 foot vaulted ceilings in my newly purchased house.  He was fantastic to work with, well priced, and works to please.  Jim has been in the business for over 20 years, and really takes pride in what he does.  Jim likes to play with color in homes and gave us some color choosing advice, which I very much appreciated.  He always showed up early, worked very efficiently, is very detail oriented, and cleaned up well after he finished the job.  If I were to have more rooms in the house (or the outside) painted, I would definitely hire him again!
1 No longer in business??? Since the company had a 5-star review, I thought I'd call for an estimate. I called the number listed, but got an "no longer in service" message. So I Googled the company name & found a different phone number & got another "no longer in service" message.
1 Would have been a 5 star if not for the fact that now a year later my house is peeling. James painted my exterior last summer and now i have peeling paint. He claimed he would come and fix anything so when i called today i discovered all his numbers and website have been disconnected. Now i am out $$$$ and no way to get it fixed. Very disappointed.
