4 Great pizza and wings nice inside and clean
5 Some of the better pizza I've had. Top 5 for sure. It's a little slow but good priced and worth.  They have some amazing garlic bread ball things you can get before the mean (or anytime I guess) and one time they hooked us up with some free dessert because the food took so long to come out.  So here is the just of it - they had some service issues, but the food and how they tried to take care of us made up for it!  Will (and have gone back) to this place again!
4 The meat lovers pizza is a solid choice; fairly topped and not too greasy.  But what I LOVE at this place are the Hell's Kitchen Buffalo Wings.  These things are NO JOKE and you need to be able to handle some serious heat if you're going to try these things.  These are burn-your-lips-off deliciousness!  I subconsciously breathed through my mouth in an attempt to cool it down and my dragon fire breath burned my husband's eyes.  Try them... if you can handle it!
4 My family and I went in to NYPD on a Thursday afternoon. Not many people occupied the tables, so were were seated quickly. The hostess was gracious as she handed us our menus. We hadn't been sitting long when our waitress came to order drinks. She was courteous and patient as we asked her opinion on different pizzas. We decided on the sausage, pineapple, and onion pizza and honey barbeque wings. Within 20 minutes, our food was brought out. The pizza was fantastic, however the wings.... the wings were a different story. They were dry and tasteless, with not enough sauce. Deemed a waste of money, the wings were left on the table as we left. Overall, service was good, pizza was good, but wings won't be tried again.
4 One of the first places I have eaten since moving to AZ, pretty good.  We had a large gathering of family, and the place was fairly busy at first, but they worked with us to get everyone seated, make sure they had drink orders, then time for everyone to make up their mind.  For what I could tell, everyone enjoyed their food, especially the cheesy garlic knots...tasty... We had Da Works pizza, it was good, not the best pizza I have had, but certainly far from the worst.  Really, the only thing was it was a little light on amount of toppings, and wasnt hot, only warm,  but with that many people, I cant really complain.
4 I love this place. I have been to 5 or 6 all across the valley and have never been disappointed. Some of the best New York style pizza in town.   Lunches are very reasonable. Can get pizza by the slice or order a whole pizza also. Also some good salads... I like the Greek with balsamic vinegar..   Lunch prices are great. Pizza and Salad for $6.00 plus cost of a drink. Better than any fast food. Can take out or eat in...   Want a dessert, try the cooking and ice cream options. If you have room after your pizza.   Would make this my regular pizza place if I had one closer to house..   Need a lunch place. Want a slice and drink.. Give it a try. Don't think they will disappointed.
4 Great food worth the wait. The menu even tells you what items will take longer so no surprises. It just gives you more time to eat some cheesy garlic knots. Yummy.
4 Great pizza! I normally travel all the way out to Coolidge for authentic New York style pizza. NYPD will not replace it, but it certainly will be a regular stop for me.
4 I really like the pizza here plus they have a great menu full of salads, calzones and other goodies. I have never been disappointed in anything I have ordered. One time they didn't have something I wanted on the menu so at the end of our meal they surprised my family with a free dessert which was amazingly good.
5 Went in for dinner and it was delish and service was great.  Beers were cold too! Ordered honey BBQ and medium wings for an app.  Wings are very meaty, flavorful and taste fresh. Dinner was a 14" pepperoni and sausage pizza.  Cooked perfect and hot out of the oven.  Our server was Tammy and she was great.   Can't wait to go back!
5 Have to say for pizza, this was the best I've had other than actually being in NYC. Went last week for dinner. The restaurant is small, so it always seems to be packed and at least a 10 minute wait. We even got there later, like 7pm. Would have checked in through Yelp but there is no wifi. Service was a little slow, but it's a busy place. Worth the wait though, pizza was excellent. Best mozzarella I've ever had on pizza.
4 Come here for the pizza... or the cheesy garlic knots... hmmm...  In all honesty... come for the cheesy garlic knots!!! I've never been disappointed and neither has any of my guests.  But really, the pizza is good too! I just happen to be so sidetracked by the cheesy garlic knots half the time that I have no room for the pizza! :(
3 This was my first time here and I enjoyed the pizza and appetizers. The Caprese Bruchetta was very good, and my friend got a Calzone that was the size of a football. The waiter was new but extremely friendly as were all of the wait staff that were around that we talked to since the place was not very busy.  This is good man food.
5 Pizza & Hot Wings are EXCELLENT! Great service & friendly staff. Started going to this location because the one on Warner Ave & Gilbert Rd. went to hell on the food & service....worth driving the extra mile : )
3 I used to love this place. About a year ago I ordered delivery and they lost our order it took over two hours. We hadn't been back until today.   I just didn't want Rosati's again we get it almost every Friday. Just burned out.   So I thought small pizzas and the beef salad. I go online and they don't have the beef salad anymore! So sad. The menu has changed a lot. So I ordered a 14 inch cheese/pepperoni for the boys and Da Works 14 inch. They said it would take 1 hr 15 minutes to deliver or 40 to pick up. I said deliver it's a wash with the drive.   They made it in 1 hour 30 minutes much better than last time. But the pizza just wasn't good. The crust wasn't crisp like it used to be and the toppings were bare. Maybe one thin piece of sausage on each slice. Crust was flavorless.   The price was way cheaper than Rosati's about $34 for the two pies but you get what you pay for.
5 I've been here several times.  Service has always been great.  At my most recent visit, they were busy, but we were served in a very timely manner.  The pizza was great!!  Really, it was like a masterpiece!  They were generous with the toppings (not too much, not too little) & they were spread out evenly so you enjoy every bite of every slice of your pizza.  It was delicious!!!  Again, service was great, the wait time was not excessive.  This will definitely be a pizza place I will go to regularly!
4 I've never been to NYC, but supposedly this is NY-style pizza.  Whatever.  It's very good.  They are probably the best pizza chain around.  Very flavorful pizza.  Tonight we had "free slice" coupons.  Not sure where they got the slices (i.e. where's the rest of the pizza?!!).  But they were fresh, hot and good.  We did take out tonight, though we have eaten in before.  In the past we haven't cared for their non-pizza dishes, but we didn't have that tonight so I won't comment this time.  You can't go wrong with the pizza, though!
4 Yes, we went back!  My previous review of their pizza still holds.  It's the best around that we've found so far.  Today I also had the soup.  Chicken and cheese tortellini.  It was very good.  Not spectacular, but very good.  Served with three garlic knots, which also were very good.  I'd give the soup and knots 3 stars, but the pizza remains a solid 4 stars.
3 This place was really good but it didn't amaze me or anything. The pizza was good but pizza is always good to me. You definitely get what you pay for though! I ate four garlic knots, only one piece of pizza and a cannoli and I was crazy full!
5 Now this is a cool joint! Subway tiles, NY signs, plaid table covers,and swingin old music! The food is delicious! From the salads to the thin slice pizza it does not dissapoint! The staff was young but super attentive.  We wish we had a place like this in California.
4 Best pizza on the planet! By far !!! So amazing and delicious. Cannot get enough. Wait staff iffy, sometimes good... Sometimes not so much.  Update~ This particular place has now gone out of business. So sad. Not sure since the food was so amaze, but maybe the waitstaff did them in.
4 Tonight was our first trip to NYPD Pizza and it was very enjoyable. My wife and I ordered a 14" pepperoni and artichoke heart pizza with hand tossed crust. We also went with cheesy garlic knots as an appetizer.   The garlic knots were were a doughy texture with good flavor, served with marinara dipping sauce, and my wife absolutely loved them. The pizza had that New York floppy crust that you need to fold over to eat. The sauce was mildly seasoned with a strong tomato flavor, and the amount of cheese was generous, no need to pay for extra unless you're just cheese crazy. It looked and tasted very fresh, not at all greasy.   The employees were very friendly, helpful, and quick. Despite the restaurant being almost full, we were in and out in just over 30 minutes. Our bill with 2 sodas and tax was $27, very reasonable for the amount of food we had.   We enjoyed the food and laid back atmosphere and will be back again soon.
4 Great pizza, awesome crust, great toppings and awesome salads here. We make a point of coming here when in town, and love it. They get super busy on weekends thouh, so keep that in mind. Last Friday, there was a line out the door.   Good stuff!!
3 We've visited several NYPD locations over the years and it is one of our favorite pizza spots!   I would typically rate NYPD 4 stars for the solid food and service. We recently moved out the San Tan area in Gilbert and so this location is new to us. The dining room is a bit small and doesn't feel quite as cozy as some of the other locations do - it is basically just a box-like retail space, hence the slightly lower rating.  That said, the food is very yummy! We almost always order the Cheesy Garlic Knots to start which are a nice way to tide over your appetite while you wait for the pizza. I'm usually surprised that they only give you one container of the marinara sauce with a 12 count of cheese knots, and also the sauce seems to be watered down. The server will generally give you an ETA on the pizza when you place your order and it is not generally shorter than about 20 minutes, so it is nice to have something to munch in the meantime. We've also ordered their buffalo wings several times which are delicious as well. The pizzas are NY style (obviously) with a delicious crust, flavorful sauce and great toppings.   They also have a variety of pastas available for those who don't want pizza - my grandmother loves the spaghetti and meatballs and I've had friends order the lasagna and chicken parmesan, all to good reviews.  DESSERT: We've had the limoncello cake, zeppolis, and cannolis, all of which are yummy. However, I tend to avoid the zeppolis most times because by the time dessert rolls around, we'll have had pizza dough as an appetizer (Garlic Knots), entrée (pizza) and dessert!   Service is generally nice and friendly, it can get a bit less attentive when they're busy. They do get VERY busy, particularly on Fridays and Saturdays. We've ordered carryout a few times from them and while they normally give a good estimate on the timeframe, the last time we were quoted 20-25 minutes. My husband arrived at the end of that timeframe and had to wait another 30 minutes for his pizza, which verged on ridiculous. However, this doesn't seem to be the norm so I don't hold it against them :)
1 went there for lunch and had great service and good chelsea salad and so so minestrone soup.  garlic knots baked to perfection with tons of flavor and a nice crisp on the bottom.  so, i bragged it up to my family and took eight of us there for dinner on friday night!  mistake number 1 !  15 minutes for drink order,  ordered the same thing i had for lunch the day before and while the salad was good the soup was warm and garlic bread was a dough ball with no garlic slurry or crisp bottom.  complained to manager and she was full of excuses of the oven not being reliable!  slice of pizza was doughy!  antipasto salad had no toppings on it!  really?  11 people supposedly working with 8 customers and could never get their attention!  what an embarrassment!  new york would evict this pretender!  someone call the  real nypd and arrest them!
3 No margaritas. Just beer and wine :-/ what's a girl to do. Indulge in some dessert maybe :)
4 My family has always liked NYPD Pizza and this location in Gilbert near the San Tan mall is a good spot.  The restaurant itself gets VERY busy on the weekends so we tend to call our order in an pick it up instead of waiting in line for a table, but during the week it's easy enough to get a seat quickly.  The service in the restaurant when we do dine in has always been fine, never over the top amazing, but good enough.  It's exactly what I would expect from this type of restaurant.  We usually start by ordering the cheesy garlic knots (whether we're dining in or picking up) because they are amazing.  My 18 month old son also loves them (he loves anything that is made of bread) and it's a nice way to keep him occupied while we wait for our pizza to come out.  Pizzas generally take 15 to 20 minutes to come out which is what I would expect and they always taste good.  I really like the sliced sausage they have available instead of the crumbled sausage.  Sliced sausage is flat and more similar in size to pepperoni... only, a little bit longer and not quite as round.  My wife's grand mother always orders the spaghetti and meatballs which she loves and ends up taking the left overs home for lunch the next day.  Overall, NYPD Pizza is a nice place to go if you're looking for a family friendly atmosphere with a very understandable and approachable menu.
5 If you are looking from some really good pizza, NYPD is by far the best!!  I am never disappointed with their pizza.  They Deliver, so give them a shot the next time you are in the mood for some pizza.
5 We have been here twice now and had great service and food each time!    Also LOVING the Veganizza! So wonderful to have a restaurant nearby that caters to my dietary "differences"
5 I love pizza and this is one of the best pizza joints in AZ. The sauce is amazing. I've never had a bad pizza there. The garlic knots are cheap and are a great appetizer.
3 Picked up a couple of pizzas, Greek salad, and a piece of chocolate cake.  The salad and cake were very good.  One pizza had sausage, olives, mushrooms, and basil.  They charged two bucks for fresh basil and what a joke.  They didn't put fresh basil on it but instead sprinkled dry basil from a spice jar.  Very little of it too boot.  Seriously, go to Trader Joe's and see what fresh basil looks like.  Hardly any mushrooms.  Sausage was good.  Mainly, the crust is super soggy.  The other pizza was Joey's Favorite and it also was super soggy.  The website said something about ordering pizza extra crispy.  Will do that next time but they need to just bake it a little more so it's minimally soggy.  My opinion.  Won't rush back but will give it another chance.
4 I've loved NYPD for years. The ranch there is my #1 favorite ranch and I'm not one of those people that eats ranch on everything.  I'm partial to the calzones because I love ricotta cheese.  I really love that they now have the smaller portioned ones, which are still large but not nearly as mammoth as the regular sized ones. The garlic knots are phenomonal, I recommend you try them if it's your first time.  I like the pizza as well.  I find the pizza to be better the second day when you re-heat it in the oven but I like a crispier crust, so that's probably why. I also think it's cool that they serve Phoenix Brewery beer, it's cool to see businesses support each other.
2 Ordered pizza for the first time here for delivery.  Got a Margherita.  It was ok.  A little too much crust with not a lot of flavor.  When delivered it was not hot so must have been sitting for awhile....
1 My friend LOVES this place, but I really don't get what makes it so special... cheesy garlic knots weren't good, pizza was over priced and the service was so so. I won't go again.
5 My family and I have been dining here since it opened, and eat there weekly. Love their pizza's, the sauce is great. Try the Sicilian pizza with salami and onion, mushroom or black olives - fantastic! Their dessert Zeppolis are wonderful, I favor the caramel sauce while the rest of my family prefers the raspberry. Antipasto salad is great but sometimes needs extra dressing which the server is more than happy to get for you.  The managers and staff are very friendly and attentive, always willing to get you whatever you need. On the weekends if you arrive after 5:30 you're in for a wait. The parking lot is usually packed so park across the lot by Jo-Ann's instead of playing musical cars.
5 My family's fave restaurant to sit down and eat in! The food is great, we ask for extra thin extra cheese pepperoni pizza and its cooked to perfection every time! Cheesy garlic knots are a must try and the servers are always friendly and knowledgeable with what's on the menu!  Restaurant is clean and has a cool NY feel to it even here in the desert. My daughters love the pizza bites and they get a dessert with it as well! All smiles from my family at this spot!  Parking ia good, when they get busy you might have to wait a while but trust me it's worth it! :0)
5 NYPD has my favorite pizza out there. It is a little pricey but so is most other places. It is totally worth it. Always make sure you get garlic knots. They are cheap and filling. They come with marinara to dip in that is sweet and tastes amazing. The calzones here are very big and tasty as well. I highly recommend their food. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. They have good dessert choices as well.  The restaurant is clean.
3 We've been here many times before and the food is always excellent. However, tonight the service was very slow. It took an hour for the food to come out, with no word from the waiter until about 5 minutes before the pizza came out. We did get seated right away, but after us, there was no hostess and there was a backup of people waiting to be seated. The restaurant wasn't even that busy. Assuming they were short staffed. Overall, food was awesome--the service not so much.
3 My husband and I swung by tonight for a fast dinner. I'd been hearing great things about it for so long and was very interested in checking it out, being new to Arizona and all.  Pros: Creative, relaxed, and festive atmosphere. Fun music, nothing overwhelming. Just how I like my restaurants. Not too busy around dinner. Our service was EXCEPTIONAL. Lindsay was charming, patient, and informative. Multiple servers stopped by our table to check on us. When my husband expressed his disappointment, our server gave us a free dessert for zappolis--MMMMMMM!  Cons: Garlic Knots weren't garlicky or cheesy or buttery or salty or anything. Perhaps they were knotty? Barbecue chicken pizza was ok--super hot in some places and lukewarm in others, with fresh shredded cilantro and bland chicken pieces. The sicilian pizza crust is flavorful, but tough.  Summary: We'd like to give it another shot. Perhaps we just need to get another type of pizza. The others looked deeelicious, and I'm sure we'll be back.
5 Garlic knots... Need I say more?! Not only are their pizza and salads amazing but they have the best garlic knots I've ever had! Even if you just go in there for dessert, it doesn't get much better than the Zeppolis! The prices are great - and you can get a single slice of pizza or a whole pizza, this place is 10 times better than Domino's, Pizza Hut or any other delivery pizza place! Get the garlic knots, i'm not sure if I forgot to mention it, but they're amazing!
2 So, this review is more based off of the service, not the food.   We walked in on a Saturday night after a full day of moving, ready to eat some pizza. It was busy, but not packed. I told the young lady how many and she said 25-30 mins. I then rudely blurted out, "that's dumb". It was the exhaustion, my apologize. However, it seemed to catch her off guard, and it worked. The 30 mins quickly turned into 5. There were empty tables for pete sake!   Once seated we were greeted by a friendly waiter. He was very nice, but I think he came by maybe 2 times after taking our order. They brought out pizza with no plates. I had to ask 3 different servers for things. The manager finally came by to clear off our table and offer us our check.   So, food was good. Service sucked.
1 I moved to the Phoenix area a month ago.  Tonight was the second night I ordered pizza and appetizers for delivery.  The first night it took an hour and fifteen minutes to receive my order.  The food was good and everyone has a bad night every once in a while.  Tonight it took an hour and forty minutes to get my order.  AND EVERYTHING WAS COLD!  My pizza looked terrible too, like it was tossed around.  Time to try some place else.
5 First off, the pizza was FABULOUS!!! Second, our super sweet cashier Ariam was such a doll and had EXCELLENT customer service!! Yay her(: we will deff be back and would totally recommend this location to others!!!
4 Hands down the best pizza! Great place to just hang with friends and have great pizza and beer.
5 Love everything about this place. The location, the staff, the bread knots, any pizza or pasta dish you get from here is AMAZING!! Been eating here since it opened. The only improvement I would suggest is to bring back the calamari!!
3 The service was good, the waitress was friendly n didn't over bother us but the food was ABC 123 it was plain as can be to me sadly...... So I'll try again cus my partner claims it's native New Yorker...... Even though I would beg to differ
5 I've been eating as one or another branch of NYPD since we moved to the Valley 13 years ago. Funny thing, there's an NYPD Pizza on Long Island where I ate whenever I was in the neighborhood, before I moved here. I hoped that these two were related. I still don't know if they are, but they're both great.  Tonight, 7/10/14, we went with a Groupon to NYPD for dinner. Our server was Lourdes. She greeted us with a big smile and asked us if we knew what we wanted to drink. Our beers were there in a New York minute. I had the Strawberry Fields Salad, besides strawberries it had apples, almonds and blue cheese in a light vinaigrette over mixed greens. It was delicious. I didn't leave a leaf or crumb of blue cheese.  We can never decide on pizza together so we always get a large and go 1/2 & 1/2. My half had the Bianco with Spinach, hubby's had meatballs & olives. I think he adds olives so I won't sneak in and eat his share after we're home.   We had 3 slices out of the pie and hubby was trying to cut another slice for me, when the pizza pan tipped over and went SPLAT on the floor.  A lovely young woman, who I think was the manager, was there in seconds picking up the mess. She offered a new pizza in 8 minutes. No problem. About 10 minutes later a new pie showed up and I had my second slice. We finished eating, paid and left.   Not only was the food good, but the service was outstanding. Offering us a new pizza was very kind and we appreciate it. Your food and service has won our loyalty. Thank you all at NYPD very much.
4 GARLIC KNOTS. You must order them.  Usually has a 15-30 minute wait on Fri/Sat night. We usually try to go for lunch, less crowded, same great pizza still offered.   There are a few tv's in the bar that will have on a game, don't count on seeing the tv's from all seats in the dining area however. There's a patio but we rarely see people sitting there, maybe its just too hot. They do deliver, but then you miss out on the fun atmosphere and neat NYC inspired decor.
