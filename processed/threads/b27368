4 This shopping center has a little bit of almost everything...functional shopping (clothes, food, home improvement), food, drinking, entertainment, etc. The only thing it doesn't have that I think it should is a gas station. The closest gas station or convenience store is out on Alma School and 8th. Not a HUGE inconvenience, but it could be misleading the first time you go.
4 This sleepy shopping center has some good places to go. The Cinemark here smells weird, but you can count on the fact that there won't be any crowds.
5 I will avoid Tempe Marketplace like the plague if I can find a comparable store/restaurant/movie time at this location.  I love it.  Easy parking, great layout, excellent variety of shops and services.
