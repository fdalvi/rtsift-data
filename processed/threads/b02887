3 There's only 2 things that make Indian-owned casinos okay:   1. Winning.  2. Indian Fry-bread w/ honey and powdered sugar. Ecstasy.    The only other comments I have are that it's smaller than SD casinos, and you get no kind of cell phone reception here, which makes finding people in your party much, much harder.
3 This is a good quick-fix gambling spot in the Phoenix area, being close to people living in Ahwatukee, Chandler, Tempe and much of the south Valley. It has the glitz and glamor of casinos, plus the digital sound of slot reels spinning, chiming bells. Mind you, it isn't Vegas, so take it for what it's worth and what it is: a quick-fix. Racketeering laws apparently don't apply to Indian casinos, because more often than not the machines will eat your money faster than a pig would slop, often not even teasing you with even a slight return. It isn't as big as a Vegas casino and there aren't nearly as many around Phoenix, which translates to more crowds. Smoking laws do NOT apply to sovereign Indian nation soil, thus making the environment unsuitable for those sensitive to cigarettes.   The area has grown from a casino outpost to a full resort, complete with dining options, a hotel, golf course, the new Rawhide tourist trap, a museum and more.   As an alternative to the flight or drive plus hotel and dining expenses of Vegas, Gila River Casinos function well. However, don't expect the same Sin City scene or to leave a winner. It does, however, make for an enjoyable time out of the house.
