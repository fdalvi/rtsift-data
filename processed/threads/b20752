4 After a recent refurbishment I have to say this place is top notch for a dip. It's a very reasonable £5.50 if you're not a member and that includes the use of a mixed sauna and steam room.  I used to go once a week which meant that I couldn't justify signing up for a monthly membership, as it works out cheaper to pay as you go.  There are changing cubicles along the side of the pool, and for that I'd recommend flip flops as shoes aren't allowed, but there are changing rooms upstairs as well. That means you don't need to sport blue over shoes when entering the pool area. Trust me they don't do much for your street cred!  Now as for the swim, it's lovely! The pool is a good length, about 22 meter,  just long enough so you don't feel exhausted when you reach the other side. Speaking of which, as someone who's pretty fit, who can run a mile or three without collapsing, I found it so difficult to swim three lengths without needing a respirator. So that got my thinking; I must be doing something wrong.   So I signed up for swimming lessons. Now I grew up in the water but I was never really shown how to do it properly, you know, that effortless way. Oh how the lessons helped!  Back, front, breast, diving, tumble turns, heck even butterfly is a breeze! Well maybe not butterfly, I don't think humans are meant to flipper that way!  And the price? £78 for 10 weeks, and the best part is you get almost 1to1 attention and you can swim at any Edinburgh leisure pool for the whole school term. That my friends is a double whammy. Great value and you feel like you're actually meant to be in the water!   One star down as the men's changing is pretty small and the floor is almost always wet, which has meant wet socks and bottom of jeans a few times. Regular dry mopping of the floor should do fix it!
