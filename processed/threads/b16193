1 I hope there was a good reason for Steve to flake on his appointment for window tinting. Attempted to contact him multiple times with no answer and no return call. Waited in the heat for a half hour outside his shop on Valley View before giving up.
5 I'm very satisfied with the service. I was recommended by two friends both had their cars tinted several years ago and the film has not been worn off or has any sign of coming apart from the windows like mine which is less than a year old. I had Steve to put on a reflective film(ones that act like a mirror during the day looking from outside), and 2 layers of light-shaded one for the windshield. I'm going heavy-dutied. The result is great, film is nicely trimmed to match the windows and there are no bubbles trapped inside. The improvement over the previous one is more than I've expected. :)  If you want an experienced tinter who knows his stuff than you should definitely come here. I would recommend this place to all my friends.
1 this guy is not honest. I have a 1998 Lexus couple (2 side windows and 1 rear wind shield) and he quotes me for $150+. WTF. if u have luxury vehicles, i would avoid this place!! good luck!
4 Spoke to Steve on the phone while I was in Hawaii.  Gave me a quote over the phone for my daughter's vehicle in LV.  She took the vehilce the next day to get it tinted and she is very happy.  My son who was up their with her confirmed that service is great and the work done was awesome.
5 Always take my cars here Steve the owner very very nice guy from Hawaii ...he really does a good job not to mention cheapest prices in town so if your looking for simply the best call Steve .....so all these other reviews that rated so slow get out of here lol I posted some pic of his work as well ...thanx again Steve
