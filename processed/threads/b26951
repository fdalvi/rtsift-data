1 Came in and asked for a certain shoe in size 6 - 7 1/2. The girl working there today responded "We only have ADULT sizes". I have never been so insulted in my life.
1 Playing repulsive music containing words and images that made me want to run from the store. I was told this is what their shoppers like to listen to. Not me. Never again and I'll warn my friends.
4 We love this place and the staff! Mick and Kat rule. We bring our dog here! Super friendly people and fun shopping environment. I like their selection of boards, shoes and accessories. We stop by once a week.
