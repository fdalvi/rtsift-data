5 Convenient way to get my registration. Very friendly and helpful staff.
5 Why would anyone ever go to the DMV when they could go here? Quick, easy, and very knowledgeable staff. I love this place!
5 Friendly service, and super-fast to get in and out.  Didn't have to wait, and I was out the door with the new title and registration in under ten minutes.  Didn't even pay attention to what their service fee was since the whole thing was pretty cheap (older vehicle).  I think you'd be crazy to stand in MVD's lines and put up with their bad attitude.
5 These guys have helped me out a few times now and once even got my title done when another place would not do it for my company title registration.  These guys are always helpful and get to you quickly even when there are people ahead of you which does not happen much anyway.  They are facing Deer Valley just west of 7th Avenue and next to my favorite gun shop DM Firearms ha ha.  Come check them out the next time you need tags, title or registration work done and stay away from the DMV
5 My husband is a disabled vet and they took great care of us for new plates for our car. Virtually no wait, and he even put our new plate on for us in 105 humid heat...What great customer service!!!! Will be back for sure!!!!
