5 I entered this business very angry and frustrated with how my computer was functioning, but was so pleasantly surprised by the owners attitude and concern for my computer problem. He was so patient as he explained what was going on, proceeded to fix the problem and then took extra time to explain things I didn't understand, even though he had many other customers that needed his attention. This type of service is so rare these days, and deserves to be recognized. This company has been in business for over 20 years, their staff is very knowledgable and accommodating to the customer. Their level of service is exemplary. They not only sell you a computer, but give customer support that far exceeds anything I have ever experienced in any electronics stores like Best Buy, Radio Shack, etc.
4 My laptop was a mess! The store associate was a lot of help :) traded in my laptop got a good deal :) two thumps up!
5 Stopped at the Mesa flea market and spoke to TJ. He gave me a lot of good information about the shop on Apache Road. So I brought my computer to them for a free diagnostic.  After leaving my laptop there for a few hours I got a call with information about what might be wrong, they asked if I wanted to continue on repairing the computer. They kept in touch with me the whole time, letting me know what the issues were and what the cost would be, before doing any of the work.  I highly recommend Bits and Bytes for any of your  needed desk or laptop computer work. The prices are fair and customer service is excellent. Stop in even if you have a laptop to trade in for one of their fully refurbished units.  Good location on Apache Trail , and a nice group to work with. If you can't stop by the shop visit their booth at the Mesa flea market listed on Yelp and located on Baseline Road in Mesa.
