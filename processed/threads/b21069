4 Yes, it's a pizza / kebab / fish & chippy. Yes it looks like every other takeaway establishment on the face of the earth...but that's kinda where the similarities finish. My wife, a local from 'da Murrayfield blok'  tells me that Monte's has been owned and run by the same family since she was wee (& not wanting to give secrets away, that's far closer to 4 than 3 decades!!!)...and I guess for fast food, that's a pretty fair indication & good sign as to what you'll get. I'll also admit that I have only had pizza and kebabs from Monte's, no f&c (oops, sorry...fish suppers) thus far, however I have had what would amount to a lifetime of their kebabs and pizzas for mere mortals and they are the business! Sure there are equal if not better takeaways in the 'burgh, somewhere, but if you're within crawling distance of Western Cnr, this is your destination.
4 This review is going to have to be a joint effort between me and my other half.  Monte Bianco is a well established family run chip shop and pizza shop.  I love the pizzas from here, they are really tasty and crisp, good toppings and you can see them being freshly made infront of you. They also make a mean calzone.    The chip shop side is where my hubby comes in as I can't eat the chips as they are not veggie as cooked in beef dripping.  My hubby says that's why they are so good!  I will have to take his word for that.  They also make their own chip shop sauce.  In Edinburgh you don't get asked if you want salt & vinegar, you get asked if you want salt & sauce.  anyway they make their own and it must be good as their is permanently a bottle of it in our fridge at home that apparently goes with EVERYTHING!
