5 Love this church! At Impact Church you'll meet real people (SO human), experience real worship (If you want to be entertained at church, this praise & worship team is Grammy worthy!), and believe in The Real Jesus!   I like the choice of services. There are 3 right now. Our children enjoy their ministry as well and I love all that my 1st grader is learning, including bible scriptures! Very safe, fun and organized!   Because of it's rapid growth in recent years, you may be inconvenienced by the long walk from the parking lots, because if you're running late, you'll have to park across the street! But the parking committee is extremely friendly and they help direct you to the best spot available.  This church is contemporary in it's look and worship style. They use current technology for audio/video presentations and music. The worship stage and backdrop is very cool. You'll have to see for yourself.  We drive 30 minutes every Sunday to attend this church where we have been helped and where we are able to help.  You should visit. It won't be a waste of time. And there's no traffic on Loop 101 on Sundays! Woohoo!
5 Very down to earth church.  Casual attire, Great Band, Love it!!!
5 Best church ever!
5 In town from Albuquerque for vacation and wanted to check out a good church. Found one! Great service! Great music! Outstanding message! Great people! Great kids service! Nice snacks. Thank you for a great experience! Can't wait to come back!
5 We love this church~! The band is beyond AMAZING! The message is always uplifting and can easily be understood and applied to everyday life.  My son is almost 4 and looks forward to going every Sunday. He even asks if we can go there when its not Sunday! We were happy at a church before but decided to visit because my brother goes there. Needless to say we never looked back and are HOOKED! Been every week since!  Can't say enough nice things about this place and am SUPER excited for its future!
1 Great band and little or no message. Not once, not twice...but three times they were asking for money. The ushers...look/acted like horny guys standing against the wall scoping chicks out and being a guy with a hot wife...didnt appreciate it at all. On that note...I have seen a few of the ushers out and about town as well as some of the worshipers. From my experience these people were some of the most dysfunctional individuals that I have had the pleasure of meeting. Did I say the band was great?
