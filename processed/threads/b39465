5 All I can say is WOW!  My air conditioning started blowing hot air.  Nobody could get out for several days, after all it is July.  Spoke to Brett at 1 pm and offered to be out between 3 and 5 the same day!  He actually beat me to my house by about 10 minutes and waited for me to get home without complaint!  He went and did his thing..  came in and told me he not only fixed the unit that was giving me trouble..  He put 1 pound of Freon into my second unit!  Not only is the one that he came out for running better than it has in a very long time...  My second unit is working even better that it was!  Brett is professional, polite, hard working, and real good at what he does.  As a Realtor, and a trainer, I am always looking for great tradespeople.  Now I FINALLY have an HVAC person that I can reccomend to the 100's of Realtors I work with on a regular basis.  Thank You Kilter Mechanical, and Thank You Brett!
5 Steve and Brett are professional, considerate, and very knowledgable about their business. They have your interests in-mind. I recommend their company for any of your heating and a/c needs.
5 Wow! They came quickly on a hot Sunday when we couldn't get anyone else out. They fixed the a/c issue quickly and explained everything to me clearly. They were kind, clean, and professional. I'd recommend them to anyone.
5 This is an amazing company! They are fast, honest, and reliable. Our air conditioning unit recently started blowing hot air, and once the call was made, their worker arrived later that afternoon. He quickly assessed the problem and fixed it. After horrific experiences with other companies, there is no one I would trust more!
