2 The lady who takes your blood here is amazing and has never missed. She also has a really great personality and made my 3 hour test a little less miserable.   The wait time for appointments has gotten  bad and I've had some issues with the front desk being rude. It's not a very personal experience so far and I'm almost through my pregnancy (39 weeks).
1 Rude front office staff.  There are problems with communication amongst the group that works here.    Typically the doctor runs at least 1/2 later than when the appointments are booked.  Well, this is what I was told by the office manager.  On average we wait 45 minutes past our appointment time just to be taken by a nurse to wait to speak with the dr.  Dr Bass himself hardly listens to anything you say.  Week after week we are telling him the same old information and the next week it always seems to be forgotten.  Even once did a test we explicitly were against.    The list goes on but I'll stop there for the sake of time.
1 Bring work with you because you will be waiting an hour every time you have an appointment. I had a prob with the lady that did my ultra sound. After waiting 50 min she told me I was having a girl which I already knew. That was my last appointment Ms. 2 pictures and 30 seconds later I was done. I asked if baby looked healthy or small she told me we are not looking for that today. Then read my chart and stop waisting my time!!! I'm usually pretty patient but expect this kind of thing EVERY time you come here.
