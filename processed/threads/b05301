5 Class act...hardly ever behind schedule. The best $9800 I've spent. My son's teeth are perfect!
5 after suffering with my first set of braces as a child, Dr. Noorda has been amazing with my abnormal treatment and I couldn't have chosen a better orthodontist. He and his staff are so kind and caring they even stayed after closing to help me with an emergency.
1 Just horrible. After $9000 paid I was told my son needed braces again. They accused him of not wearing his retainer which he always did. And, then they said he needed braces for another $3k. After year of our last visit they are sending my son notices to come back. Well, let me see, it wasn't my son making the payments. I dont think we will be back without an attorney so I can get some of my money back and get my son's teeth fixed correctly.
5 My oldest daughter got her braces off six years ago. My eldest son just got his braces off last year. my youngest son has just finished his phase one and my youngest daughter will start her phase one next year.  We have loved every minute of this process and I think my children's teeth are absolutely beautiful!  The office staff is so very kind and treat us like family. I feel blessed that I was referred to dr. Noorda when we moved to Vegas. Dr. Noorda is kind patient and intelligent. I highly recommend them.
