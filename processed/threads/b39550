5 Great Chinese food and massive amount of drink choices for teas, slushies. Chicken fried rice is phenomenal.
4 Mom and pop operation is good. Their specialty drinks are what I'll come back to.
5 Hard to believe this place only has two reviews on Yelp.  We were in town for the Mountain West Basketball Tournament and wanted to get away from "The Strip" and find something to eat before the game.  While driving around the UNLV area, we noticed Mr. Bejing in this little strip mall type place next to a pizza place and a sandwich shop.  We got there just after 4pm and their menu said the lunch prices ended at four.  The server said we could still get those prices so that was great.  My friend had Kung Pao chicken and I had chicken and broccoli.  The food came out quickly, was piping hot and tasted really fresh.  Everything from the service to the food to the prices were great!  I had some hot and sour soup that was very good as well.  We really didn't want to get gouged for another meal in our hotel or around The Strip and felt like we hit the jackpot in finding Mr. Bejing.
