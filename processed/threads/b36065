5 When Steve Wynn built the Mirage back in 1989, he wanted his guests to be bring the tropical themed resort to Vegas as a retreat from the desert and the atrium is one of the last remenants of the old Mirage before MGM had taken over and changed the vibe of the resort.  But anyways this is a great place to relax from the casino and the club and just unwind just listening to the waterfall and the water flowing under the bridge and smelling the tropical plants feels like a breath of fresh air away from the smokey casino and the Vegas heat.
5 The atrium never fails when your staying in the Mirage and it just makes you want to stay awhile and smell the fresh air.
3 its always a little akward to walk from the parking garage through the lobby all the way accross the casino to get to anything in the mirage if you self park.  but the treck is worth it to get a nice little view of sunlight and plants growing in the atrium.  very small and short but still you can't help but appreciate it in the middle of the desert!
1 I guess if you'd never seen the Atrium before the MGM got it hands on it you might be impressed. What an incredible downgrade. Nothing here that one couldn't find in the plant selection at home depot. Heart breaking at best.
4 Very cool attraction to see if you're in the area!   Well maintained and a cool site inside of a hotel.
