1 BE AWARE - DO NOT BUY FROM THIS STORE.  I purchased a shoe for my son from this store; he wore the shoe once and got blisters on his feet.  I went to the store for a exchange and the store would not exchange it because it was worn.  YES, it was worn once, otherwise I would not know about his blisters.  I'm so DISSATISFIED.  I will NEVER buy from this store again.  Something needs to be done about their return policy.
3 I have purchased from this store and location twice and have been happy with both transactions and product.  I shop here for my hubby's DC brand shoes as they have the best selection always along with good prices. I pick out the style of the shoe I want and I ask for my husbands size and I am on my way.  This last visit was cool because the Supervisor Eugene was on duty and he was a sweetheart and shook my hand thanking me for my business.   Their service is always on it, the same male employee (salesperson #28045) helped me on both of my visits 6 months apart. This fellow is not pushy yet he works his rump off in helping you find what you are looking for. I wish I could remember his name because he is Awesome and truly likes his job and it shows when he is assisting you.  I have never had an issue here, I go in pick out a pair of shoes and they bring me the size I requested.  I only tip is to make sure you try on what you buy or make sure like I do if you are buying for someone else that you are certain of the size.  Their receipt clearly states the following: No refund...No refund...No refund Exchange or store credit within 30 days of purchase if unworn with original box. Tags and receipt.
5 Staff was very upbeat, knowledgeable and helpful. Every time I come to LV I will stop by just because of the great customer service!
