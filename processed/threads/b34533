1 California residence and anyone else in this moody MAD police officers way.  Officer Elmer of the Arizona Highway patrol NOTICED my California plates and CHOOSE ME ALONE out of several other arizona vehicles to get behind FOLLOW real close and give a ticket to.  He also stated that WE Californians should learn to obey Arizona speed limits.  I was going 76 in a 65 11mph over the limit.. He was very rude and unprofessional in his demeanor as well.  BEWARE of this keystone cop
3 Thank you for keeping us safe!  I think we can use more Highway Patrol officers on the freeways patrolling the HOV lanes and nailing those violators during rush hour that don't follow the multiple persons in car law.  We also need you to pop the fools who drive 15+ mph LESS than the speed limit and slowing up traffic which causes dangerous situations on the highways.  We know you're trying your best and we appreciate that!  Good job doing it with limited resources.
5 Sorry but most of us should be giving props to them, they are doing their job and put their lives on the line every day.  I had a tire blow out last night and forgot my cell phone and was changing my tire while watching the semi's whiz by.  Didn't get the officers name but he provided a 2nc set of eyes so I could get my job done a lot quicker.
