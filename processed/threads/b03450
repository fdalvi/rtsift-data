5 Best dentist I have ever been to. Robert is the dentist to see.
5 Let me just start off by stating my success with dentists in the past...AWFUL! I have such bad experiences that I put off going to the dentist for a cleaning for almost 2 years. When my wife told me to try another dentist, I did a lot of research, eventually leading me to Smile Concepts.   WOW! I couldn't have found a better dentist! Dr. Robert is way cool! Very down to earth, and after I told him my past experiences, he made me feel very comfortable.   I am proud to say that I have finally found a dentist that I can call my own. Thanks Dr. Robert!
5 Always a great visit to see Dr. Rouhani.  Always looks out for the best interest of his patients, and that's why his practice is growing.  If you are looking for a new dentist, definitely consider Smile Concepts.
5 Dr. Rouhani is the man! His skill as a dentist is by far superior to any I have ever been to. He has redefined what it means to go to the dentist for my family and I. As a matter of fact, I have referred people from out of town, on a visit, to him and now they will make trips just to go see him!
