5 Beautiful course, we had a great day.  The Shrimp dinner was wonderful, very light breading.  Everyone is very friendly.
1 Terrible experience! The staff there was extremely rude to us the entire day. I will never come back to this golf  course or recommend it to anyone. If you would like to have a nice experience, choose somewhere else.
1 If I could give this course no stars, I would. WORST customer service experience of my life. Not only was the manager a complete jerk the whole day, the beer cart girl was lazy and snotty. She literally made a Starbucks run for the employees while she was "working." Not only have they lost our company's business for our annual golf outing, but we will never go back for golf league ever again. If you are looking for a good local course in that area, try Lake Windsor Golf Club or the Oaks. Much better courses and they are busy because their staff is professional. Obviously, Sun Prairie Golf Course got the employees who couldn't cut it at a good course.
