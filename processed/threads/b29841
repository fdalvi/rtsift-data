4 Your one stop shopping for just about all your halloween needs. There's a few other halloween stores opened up across Las Vegas, but this one is located in Henderson, next to the Burlington Coat Factory on Stephanie Street.  Politicians, Celebrities, Superheroes, Old School, Hip Hop, Woodstock, Disco, Gangsters,(Get your MC Hammer parachute pants here!) you name it , they've got it aside from your usual monsters, zombies, ghosts, and goblins, adult humor, decor for your windows, house, and yard, etc.  If you're undecided yet what to dress up as, maybe this place will give you a few ideas....ALOHA!!!
1 Did this re-open next to Total Wine this year?  If so, this place is a hot mess. Literally.  The store is in shambles and its 100+ degrees out still and they're apparently too cheap to pay for a/c. Makes for an uncomfortable shopping experience!  They're selling over priced crap.... most of which, it was tough to find an item that wasn't marked down for being damaged already. I weep for these employees.
2 Not impressed.  This place doesnt have alot of stuff and I can never find what I need. I rather shop at Spirit Halloween.
