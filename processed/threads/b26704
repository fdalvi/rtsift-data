1 This company was honestly a complete waste of time and money for my husband and I. Lots of claims made up front with little to no follow through. We most certainly did not get our money back as the 100% money back guarantee claimed. Don't even bother!
1 big big scam......!!!!!!   they try to get 1200 dollars from you.  then do nothing.  then they give you a big story about how they are talking to the creditors and they need more money to get things settled but they are just lying to you and keep trying to milk you for money until you finally give up.....just a game...praying on people who in many cases had some bad luck.  stay away....blow your money at a casino at least you have some type of chance. i am surprised someone has not really given them what they desere. they are crooks pure and simple.
1 Got scammed and lost money, can't believe I paid for their services and out of 8 negative items they only negotiated 2 when I paid for all 8. What a shameful company and individuals! I'm going to file a complaint.
