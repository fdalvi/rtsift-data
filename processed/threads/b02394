4 This place is like a toy store for woodworkers. They had every type of woodworking machinery, hand tools, and accessories you can imagine. From sandpaper to dowels, drill bits, they seem to have it all. They have two separate buildings next to each other. One houses all the equipment and tools and the other is where they sell lumber and pieces of wood to work with. They also have a planing service that does pieces to around three feet wide. $90.00 per hour. The staff was very helpful and even the owner came and talked with me to give me some advice on some wood pieces I had done there. I plan to return.
4 I love this place! Some stuff is better priced than Home Depot & I think some stuff is waaaay over priced, but if I had $$$$, I would spend the majority of it here stocking up our shop.
5 Do not walk into this place if you have a bad heart! WWWOOOOOWWW talk about a selection! Holy cow. I've been going there for a little over 3 years and it never gets easier. It's like a Disneyland of wood working tools. I wish I had $$$. I think if a had 50 grand I could almost get everything I want in that store. Some serious machinery at some serious prices. But all the little accessories are reasonably priced and they carry a lot of hard to find items. Trust me, leave your CC at home :)
