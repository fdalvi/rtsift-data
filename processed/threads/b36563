4 It's been years since I've had Blimpie's Subs.  I was very happy to hear they opened a new joint in Scottsdale a few months ago.  Since they opened, I've dropped in here for lunch a few times.  My favorite Sandwich is the 12" Blimpie's Best, $7.49.  I also get some Jalapeno Chips to go with it.  I get it "Blimpie's Way", with all of the fixings...yum!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blimpies-subs-scottsdale?select=9oK4uPQAA1ofm3Urr282XA#9oK4uPQAA1ofm3Urr282XA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blimpies-subs-scottsdale?select=OE-d2e9jEzu1Ftb5wU0UJw#OE-d2e9jEzu1Ftb5wU0UJw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blimpies-subs-scottsdale?select=HAhmnUbnz1-N1LREIomd3Q#HAhmnUbnz1-N1LREIomd3Q http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blimpies-subs-scottsdale?select=UhjMsv5ipjmiekxuHPk8MA#UhjMsv5ipjmiekxuHPk8MA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blimpies-subs-scottsdale?select=QW-F1GdDmHROOqla0IK8Sg#QW-F1GdDmHROOqla0IK8Sg  The restaurant is very clean and the employees here are friendly.  I love coming here for a quick bite to eat.  Return Factor - 95%
5 This place is a PHENOMENAL go to for a sub!!!  This location has been selling many of their subs at a discounted price of $5 for a 12 inch. THe bread is ALWAYS fresh, and so are the ingredients....  I always get the veggie and cheese and get ALL the fixings pretty much as far as veg, with oil and vinegar an' a touch of mayo. It's great with the parmesan bread.  Staff is always friendly and so is the owner I've talked with him several times.  Enjoyable!!
5 They carry Eegee's!!!!!!!  I love Eegee's but am rarely in Tuscon. Finally I have a place to go satisfy my cravings without having to drive 90 min.   Their subs are pretty good too :)
5 Always fresh ingredients, clean store, friendly staff, excellent 5 dollar lunch choices.  Doesn't get much better than that!
5 I work in the Pavillion Talking Stick Shopping center and find my self eating at Blimpies quite often. Their price is very affordable and their food is always fresh and delicious. I think it is the manager that has helped me out but he is very nice! He knows I work in the shopping center so automatically gives me a 10% discount. He also engages in conversations and tells me suggestions to get on my sub since I usually get the same thing every time. The manager of this place is what keeps me coming back and they will have my business!
5 I LOVE Blimpie - a toasted blimpie best is amazing! Bright clean store, super friendly staff. This is my quick go-to lunch spot.
5 Clean. Prompt and courteous staff. Great subs toasted or regular. I love the toasted ultimate club on ciabatta bread. Definitely try the Eegee's slushee/ icee stuff. I usually don't get that kind of thing but they gave me a sample and now I'm hooked. Tucked between YC's and the theatre it's a little hard to see from the entrance to this strip mall area.
