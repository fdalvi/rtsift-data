5 $15 for eyebrows and upper lip! The owner Rohi does a really good job shaping and perfecting my eyebrows. This just opened a month or so ago so it's not busy at all. Which is good for me cause I can get right in that chair! :)
5 Found my new eyebrow threading boutique! It is owned by a lovely lady and her sister. This is the southwest location, and her sister is at the northwest. She was very detail oriented and lightly educated me on how my ethnicity actually affected the direction my hair follicles grew? Who takes the time to do that? Thank you very much for your very sweet chair-side manner. I will definitely be coming back! I think everyone in the southwest location should try this place out! :)
5 Randomly found this eyebrow threading shop today.. & I'm so glad they finally opened a place closer to my house. I normally go to eyebrows r us on Fort Apache & Trop but their service is AWFUL! The owner was super sweet and took her time to shape my eyebrows. I will definitely be coming back :)
5 I came today to get my eyebrows threaded. She did a wonderful job and really cleaned everything well. My shape looks great and I will definitely come again!
