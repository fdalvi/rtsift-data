4 The Maid of the Forth is a ferry and cruise service that operates from South Queensferry. Its various trips have the attraction of sailing under the famous Forth Rail Bridge, and usually to the historic site of Inchcolm Abbey on the Island of the same name.   As one of two ferry services up the Forth from Queensferry, The Maid offers two main types of cruise. The first is a simple sail up, under the Rail Bridge and around the Inchcolm Island. The other is much the same but with an opportunity for visitors to stop off on the Island and explore both it and the Abbey. The cruise itself takes about an hours in total, with an extra hour and half added for an Island visit. The cruise only will cost around £10 for an adult, £3.50 for children, with concessions and family discounts available. A cruise and explore tripe costs £14.70 for adults, £5.85 for children, with similar discounts.  All in all this makes a lovely day trip. Needless to say this trip is somewhat weather dependent. But kids seem to love it. It's also a great opportunity to bird spot, particularly puffins. When I was aboard the ferry we also managed to get a great view of two sunbathing seals!  The Maid of the Forth also offers special events, like educational school trips and wedding services. This is all detailed on their website along with a sailing schedule.
4 This is great, it you want to have a better view of the Firth Of Forth than simply driving over them!! If you get a good clear day you get a good view of edinburgh and Fife. For £5 extra you can land at Inclom Island. the boat has a cafe and , bar and snacks. I got my tickets on Groupon cheaper , but normal price is £11 per person, geat it you have a day and unsure what to do!
5 Great day out! Lots of things to see from the boat including seals and sea birds.
