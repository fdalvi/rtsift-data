4 Rosa said she makes everything from scratch.  My husband loved his tacos!  He said he will be back, and he can't wait to try her burritios!  I got the rolled taco's and they reminded me of my childhood. It tasted like the shells were made from scratch.  The meat was a little to chunky, but other than that I really enjoyed the tacos.  The rice was pretty good too.  I'm sure I will be back.
3 Carne Asada meat dry and tough with some gristle. Ingredients are fresh, but meat was at best, okay. Still need to try other menu favorites in future, maybe score will improve.
3 The food at Rosa's was pretty decent, but nothing extraordinary. I was a bit concerned dining here midweek around 6:30pm and being the only person in the joint. The ambiance is pretty nice for a taco shop. Very clean, very new - it used to be a Jersey Mikes Subs which usually has decent decor.   I took advantage of their $.99 bean & cheese burrito special and it was definitely good. My wife had the enchilada w/ rice & beans and that was below average. I'd definitely give Rosa's another shot, specifically for the burrito (which btw, was huge) but definitely concerned that we were the only people in there before eating, during eating, and after eating. In Spanish they would say that's no bueno.
4 Ok, I didn't retry the Carne Asada meat yet, which got a bad review, but I'm trying other Mex favorites on menu. Today, Chorizo Torta with sour cream. Delicious!! And it was a healthy portion. Torta bread, which ruins a lot of Torta sandwiches if not good, was warm, soft, toasted, and moist. I would definitely eat again and recommend for anyone looking to have a good Torta.
5 My new favorite taco shop! Carne asada plate is awesome. It's less greasy than most places. The mulitas, like a quesadilla is nice and cheesy. The staff is friendly and helpful. Grilled peppers and onions are spicy but oh so good. Went there twice and it was a great experience both times.
3 Edit of review below: ROSA'S is out of business. Not there any more. Gone. Kaput.  Too bad. Good food. Nice people running it.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I have eaten here probably 10 times. The place is spic and span clean and staff is very friendly. Everything I've tried has been delicious. Carne Asada Tacos, Chicken Enchiladas, Chicken and Beef Taquitos, Fish Tacos were all very tasty.  Good lunch specials too. My favorite is the Friday Fish taco special. Two fish tacos w/rice and beans and a 20 oz drink for only 4 bucks. They have a large menu selection and all prices seem reasonable. They even have a few things on the menu that I've never heard of before. I can't wait to try them.  A couple things they could improve on:  They have TVs on the wall and usually the volume is too high for my liking. I think so that the staff can hear them from behind the counter. Are the TVs for the patrons or the staff? I think for the staff, because they are always tuned to Spanish stations. English or Spanish stations I don't really care, I find the TVs annoying and prefer when they are playing mariachi music and the TVs are off.  I also think they need to add a salsa bar instead of only giving you salsa in little plastic containers. No spicy carrots, cucumbers, jalapeno peppers, onions, cilantro etc. like at Fausto's Mexican Grill or Roberto's Taco Shop. Both are less than 3 minutes away. They both have salsa bars and food that is roughly the same style and quality. Seriously Rosa, to be competitive, you NEED a salsa bar. Lose the TVs. Add a Salsa Bar and I'll give you 4 stars (maybe 5).    This place is relatively new and I haven't seen many people in there yet. People are still discovering Rosa's. I like the staff. I really like the food. I hope they make it.
