4 Our visit to Las Vegas included visiting a couple of Thrift Stores.  Veterans Village Thrift Store is large with lots to choose from.  Though they just recently opened their store was set up quite nicely and pretty organized.  People were very friendly and helpful.  Great prices.
1 I have to say, even for a thrift store, the smell of a urine-soaked sofa just doesn't do a thing for me. Though I did get a chuckle out of the $2500 price tag form the faux gold Buddha piece in front.  Now I've braved quite a few thrift stores in my day and can weed thru the worst of them and find something of intrinsic or partially artistic value. But this place was a hodge podge collection of hand-me-downs that I fear the dregs of society would even refuse. Bum throw offs is being nice, they're so deplete of useful things.  Now if I can only the pee smell out of my nostrils...
