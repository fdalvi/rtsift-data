5 Alas, now closed. Shame. If they ever open up again this is what to expect: This is THE best place to buy chocolates as a gift (or even as a treat for yourself). Choose the box - they come in different sizes, then choose the chocolates to go in. And what a choice. You can avoid the difficulty of choosing by opting for a pre-picked selection, but if you want to make sure you get your favourites then it's best to pick them yourself. The ones with chillies or peppers are especially nice, but they also create lots of fragrant flavours which are a bit milder on the tongue. Once you've filled your box they'll wrap it in ribbon and a very fancy bag. The packaging is a work of art in itself. All of this is a little expensive if you're used to buying Black Magic, but the quality is well worth what you pay. As well as the choccies, they also sell cakes and pastries which look very rich and delicious, and selections of tea and hot chocolate to try at home.
2 used to be my heaven on earth - but not the same now as under new management/ ownership. Still got a nice covered front terrace to sit outside.
5 When my husband and I lived in Edinburgh, this was our favorite chocolatier.   The handmade chocolates are encased in a thin shell designed with beautiful cocoa prints. The store also wraps these jewels up in a tasteful celadon green box imprinted with their logo and tied up with a brown ribbon.   There are an assortment of flavors including lavender, sencha tea, lotus flowers, bergamot essence, pepper, and so much more.   *** Another closed location, but I had this already written in my queue. I'll miss this place. Does anyone else recommend a chocolatier that does a similar style?
