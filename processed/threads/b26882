4 Polite service. I got what i needed and was in & out in 3 minutes. I like it like that. No lines!
2 Definitely surprised that I didn't escalate as much as I should have.  Not really the best experience, but looking back, the employee was nice.  I bought a few things online and noticed that it didn't work for me once I received it.  The receipt did allow me to take the items back to a physical store, however, when I got there, she wouldn't refund it back to my card.  I could only get a store credit.  I was a little turned off because I literally returned over $60 in merchandise.  That meant, I had to use that money back in CVS, a place I shop at about once every 3 years.  Definitely useless to me.    Like I said, the employee was really nice, which is why I didn't really escalate the situation.  I still don't prefer the policies that this company sets for their customers.
