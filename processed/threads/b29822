5 Tana has been a blessing in my life. I have been seeing her for over 4 years off and on now. When ever I need her, she is there to give me positive support and a lifetime of wisdom I can use to get me through the rough times. I appreciate her and definitely recommend choosing Tana as your Life Coach :) No doubt
5 When I started to see Tana, I was a real people pleaser and I was starting to become resentful because of this behavior. I had lost sight of what direction I wanted to go in and only did things that pleased others. Tana has helped me focus on what my true goals really are and not what I thought somebody else expected me to do. She helped me break down problems I was facing into manageable pieces and I now see what is really important to me and make better decisions. I was able to walk away from our session knowing what steps I needed to take to make my life more enjoyable. And best of all - she genuinely cares about the people she works with!
5 Tana makes the best aromatherapy blends. She puts them in roller ball containers so you can use them if you have headaches, stress, need energy or want to boost your concentration. She makes different blends for many kinds of problems. Her office always smells nice and relaxing, which goes along with the work that she does with life coaching and hypnotherapy.
