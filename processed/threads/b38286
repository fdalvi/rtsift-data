4 The cooks at this particular Denny's are very good.  The wait staff are friendly and quick.  My mom and I eat breakfast here often and have never been disappointed.
1 If you are looking for a place that serves hot chocolate made with milk not water, then this is not the place for you, they did not even add whip cream when I asked for it! RIDICULOUS!!
3 You always know what you're going to get when it comes to good at Denny's.   When they're staffed properly, the service is usually prompt and friendly. Looks like I'm in luck, this morning.
4 Decide to go Denny's for my son's birthday, Yay he got a free breakfast.  The food was fine, very typical Denny's food. I has the biscuits and gravy and a scrambled egg. It was perfect, my son loved his breakfast as well. Will return for my birthday. The waitress was very nice, the food was warm. Just a nice simple place.
5 Came for a Grand Slam and it was the best Grand Slam I've ever had. They even made the bacon just the way I requested (very very well done, almost burnt without actually burning), which is rare because at most places I still get floppy bacon no matter what I say. The hostess was friendly, my waitress was friendly and efficient, and the dining area was clean and organized. Definitely want to come back to this location.
4 Everytime I come here I'm always treated nicely by the staff. They're friendly and do an excellent job. The food is good too. I ordered the strawberry lemonade and it was delightfully tasty. But honestly I've had better. Same goes with their coffee as well.   I had the red, white and blue slam yesterday and it was okay. It's not as good as they advertise it on tv. It's a good thing they only offer it for a limited time.
