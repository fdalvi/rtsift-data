4 I don't play games (ha), but my young nephew does -- a gift certificate from GameStop is what he wants for Christmas, birthday and any other day. He has a PS3, xBox, and a PSP so this is definitely one of his fave stores. The walls are covered from floor to ceiling, front to back, and the store has more than just games.   The employees here were helpful and quick, and even showed me a selection of gift cards to choose from based on the occasion. They got me in and out quickly, which always makes me happy!
3 Just a place to look at games  I usually find them cheaper after waiting or purchasing them Pre-Owned
4 Between having to buy my games at either a Walmart , target or GameStop ; I definitely choose this GameStop every time. The staff is always up to date , well informed & every time I walk threw the door they're always helpful . So if your like me & want to play the newest game as soon as it gets out without having to wait for a Walmart associate to unlock the glass case of doom lol then you'll like this GameStop . You'll notice I only gave it 4 stars , well it would have been 5 if it was a bit bigger & that's my only complaint . Stay awesome Phoenix :-)
