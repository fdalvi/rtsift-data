5 A great Legion Post, excellent reasonable food, very congenial members, always make you feel welcome. Always a pleasure to come here. The menu is great, there is music, special events, and terrific cocktail prices. A top notch American Legion Post! Their chef is terrific! Can't beat the steak sandwich, the Reuben, the fries, the soups, for lunch. In fact I have never had a bad meal here. It may not be haute cuisine but the friendliness the reasonable prices and the very nice patio, by the way, make this an A1 Post!!!
4 Great post. Good food and nice people. Great location.

4 A great place to relax and visit with Veterans of my era and the younger ones.  Wonderful bar and service and can't go wrong for a good reasonably priced lunch.  Try it it you will like it.   William
5 I am writing this review on behalf of my mother because she is not a yelper. Here are her comments: On our recent visit to Scottsdale my husband and I visited to post 44. The patrons and bartenders were super friendly and made us East Coasters feel welcome. I would recommend both young and old visiting this post. The drinks are cheap and there is gambling! It's a good place to go to get a drink and make some friends. It's not called the "best damn post in the west" for nothing.
