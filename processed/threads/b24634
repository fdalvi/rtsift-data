5 Been going here for 5 yrs now. Spa pedicure with some extra special free perks you don't get at other places......and for the same price! With your pedicure and/or manicure they also do a hot rock message on your legs and/or arms! Once in a while they even throw in a free cooling gel or paraffin wax treatment. They do an amazing job and always make me feel good when I go there! Also they give you a "frequent flyer" card so if you go often enough after 5 or 6 visits you get a $5 discount on your next one! :o) And we can all use a little break here and there these days! We can't be cutting out too much of spoiling ourselves once in a while, we all deserve it! ;o)
5 Staff is super friendly and it is the ONLY place where a french style pedicure stays on for weeks without chipping! I have brought three friends here and they don't go anywhere else now! Highly recommended!
5 Amazing work at this small location, the staff is extremely friendly and the Prices are really good.  Highly recommend if you are in the area.
5 Nice people, good prices!  Make an appointment or call ahead unless you don't mind waiting if necessary. :)
