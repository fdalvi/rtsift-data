4 When I get food here, well anywhere. I always special order things. Due to food allergies and things like that. They always get it right and have never shorted me on food. Which is a bonus. The chicken is surprising better then other KFC. If you get a famous bowl you get actual chicken strips inside of those ugly chicken balls. I would give it 5 stars but the staff isn't very social.
1 I HATE YOU ! YOU RUINED MY LIFE !   Well , i was that angry that the second time i went to this location for pot pie, they were out (second time they said machine died) so got the breast meal.. got it home and received the 2  meals both breasts were definitely sitting around for a few hours..just vile..$11 wasted on crap.  my advise LOOK ELSEWHERE
1 I have visited this store twice and BOTH times they were out of extra crispy recipe....ok you advertize that you have it you would think that at dinner time you would make sure that it is available... I know it is popular so I would think you would keep it up. Next the macaroni was mush, I asked for corn on cob.. they no longer have it? and the biscuits were nothing but raw flour dough in the center!!  pay attention ppl! you are serving the public.. although I realize this store is on the border of Apache Junction.... it's no excuse !!!!
1 They need to lay off the ice. More than 3/4 of my drink was full to the top of ice. Two sips and you're done. Is it worth 7 bucks for a crappy meal? Nope!
