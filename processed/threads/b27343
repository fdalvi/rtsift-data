5 This station plays a great variety of oldies and classic rock. Where else can you hear Phill Collins & Genesis, The Four Tops, Bruce Springstein, The Temptations, and so forth all on one station?! The Djs' are bubbly and full of life, giving you all the information you need.
5 LOVE this station and its DJs! I won tickets to the Monkees concert through this station and am a loyal listener. This station is housed in the same building with another fave of mine, KMLE Country.  The only thing I wasn't keen on was trying to get there to pick up my tickets. It's in downtown Phoenix but one wrong turn and you end up the wrong direction to get into the parking lot. I found this out but still made it in okay to pick up my prize.
3 When I'm looking to calm down and relax, this is a station that I'll tune into.  The tracks are a bit slow for me most of the time, but enjoy it on occasion.  I'll immediately tune out once a DJ starts to talk...not a fan of talking on a music radio station.  Return Factor - 50%
