1 I have been living here for two years.  The apartment is REALLY small (2 bedroom, around 850 sq ft) Within this last year they painted the exterior a horrendous green color.  We also got COCKROACHES.  We had the office spray several times, to no avail.  We finally had to completely empty our kitchen and buy some roach poison online to get rid of them.  We were roach free in a few weeks due to the measures we took.    We have had to replace our dishwasher twice.  The first one was bad.  They replaced it with a bad one and then the third one was finally ok.  We have also had to have the refrigerator replaced.  You cannot use the crisper in the "new" unit because it is bad quality.  We have patches in the walls and the ceiling is buckling in several areas.    The staff is awful.  They have gone through new staff approximately four times since we moved in.  When our lease came up they tried to raise our rent $100 per month for a yearly renewal.  When we tried to make a deal with them they refused to even negotiate.  They care more about profits than their residents.  I would NEVER live here again.
