5 This company works really fast, they're friendly and they fixed my Internet problem with my desktop really quickly. I definitely recommend them.
5 My laptop crashed. I looked up computer repair in the area. Called a few places and not only was Drew at Reboot Tech the fairest price but also he had it back to me a couple of hours later fixed but with additional security updates at no additional charge. Drew has also been available with questions I've had since by phone. I highly recommend Reboot to anyone in the area.
5 I had a virus on my computer that made it so I couldnt even start it up.  I called Drew and he happened to be close to my neighborhood so he came and picked up my computer.  I was able to pick it up the next day.  He charged me $56, which I thought was a very good deal.  My computer is running fine now and he even installed an anti virus program for free and also repaired my power cable for free too.  I would definitely recommend Reboot to my friends and family.
