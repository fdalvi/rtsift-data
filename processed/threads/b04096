5 I live in way south chandler and so this place is always a long trip, but I frequent this place because the have great prices and impeccable service.  They have saved me on more than one occasion with a print job that needed to be turned around the same day.
2 After a few successful projects, I was sooooo hopeful that I FINALLY found a printer that was fast, efficient and reasonably priced.    My hopes were shattered.    New project: after sending over my info, attachments and needs via email twice, I heard nothing.  Crickets.  After a phone call to them and confirming that they got my email, I heard nothing.  Crickets.    So next new project: a banner.  Maybe my last experience was a fluke.  Sent over all the info, gave them a call and confirmed they recieved my email.  Again, nothing.  Crickets.  I obviously never had it made there, but I did get an email response 3 weeks later (I'm not exaggerating)  Boo.  I have since found another printer....good help is hard to find and unfortunately, you won't find it here.
