4 This is a nice organization that serves senior citizens across the valley by delivering food to them. As a volunteer, it doesn't get much simpler. All it takes is some time from your Saturday morning, and some gas and mileage on your car. It might help to know your way around a little bit, but they provide printed maps of where you're going. I thought I was going to bust out the GPS, but I didn't need to.  I finally did my first delivery this morning. You check in at their office in a building across from Palace Station. They assign you either two or three delivery locations that are in close proximity to each other. You get the bags of food and you're off.  I didn't care where my deliveries were, so they gave me a couple of seniors near Mojave and Bonanza. They were virtually across the street from one another. The second Saturday of each month is a larger delivery, so each of my stops got three bags of food. I should really say the fourth Saturday - starting January, they will do deliveries on the 2nd and 4th Saturdays of each month.  It only took me maybe a total of 70 minutes from arriving at their office to returning to their office. I think most of my time was spent waiting to be assigned (there was a long line of volunteers for them to process and get underway). I came straight back because they need the signed delivery slips as proof for their funding purposes. I saw some people still leaving for their deliveries as I returned.  I would definitely do this again.  http://www.hhovv.org/
