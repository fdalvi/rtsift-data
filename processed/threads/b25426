5 Sam, the owner is awesome. Prices are great, and atmosphere rocks!
5 What an amazing atmosphere. Simply put - it's a home away from home. The owners are friendly, inviting & superior customer service. Beautiful lounge & a great selection of cigars. I'm hooked! I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town!
5 This is a great little shop. Good selection, nice place to hang, too. When I've asked for the mgr's recommendations, they've been excellent. A great find!
5 I have been Smoking cigars and frequenting cigar lounges for quite a few years now, and I can not remember the last time I found a gem like Fine Ash. Sam and his wife, Rosie, are awesome, down to earth, friendly, and knowledgeable. The lounge is comfortable and the prices are very competitive. Every customer is made to feel welcome and appreciated. I found Fine Ash about a month ago and it feels like home. This truly is a Fine Ash Cigar Lounge.
5 A good friend if mine turned me onto this place.  It's awesome!  If your looking for a place to kick back and enjoy a good stick for an awesome price this is your place.  Sam the owner is awesome and does what it takes to make the place friendly and inviting.  Make sure you find out about their next event too!  This place is privately owned by good people who work hard to do a good job.  You should be there right now!
5 Sam and Rosie absolutely run a great cigar lounge.  A fun atmosphere. Make time to burn.
5 Awesome shop. You can't beat it! Great customer service and atmosphere.  Huge humidor and a large selection. Best place in the valley I have found.
