5 Ashlee cares about her clients and will go the extra mile to make sure they are taken care of. I would recommend her to anyone who needs insurance. It is so nice to have a local agent you can depend on, instead of just a call center where the people don't know you and you never know who you're going to get!  Ashlee will be a great agent for you!
5 Ashlee and her staff are amazing. They care more about the coverage and service that you get and less about just selling you a policy. They will be my first point of contact from now on for all of my personal and business insurance needs.
5 Ashlee is always great, gets me all the info I need and helps in anyway she can for all my insurance needs.
5 I had a very positive experience with Ashlee.  We had a customer that was opening a store near her office, and needed to be covered right away. The customer had a very tight timeline, and we simply did not have time for any mistakes.   Ashlee delivered big time. Not only was she able to get our customer the coverage that they needed, BEFORE the deadline, and for a lot less than our customers budget. Completed in full, on time and under budget.   AND, she was both pleasant and professional the entire time. What a great experience!  Thank you Ashlee, for being great at your job!!!!!
