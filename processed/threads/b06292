3 Average nail salon. $32 for a mani & spa pedi. Nothing special, but an A-OK experience.
2 Short Version:  Solid pedicures, bad manicures (multiple cuticle nicks/cuts, and not a good finished product, half done) horrible full set of nails (very thick and looked like they were a week or two old when they had just been done as the nail did not even get close to covering the full nail area).  Long Version: The longer I'm on Yelp the more I feel bad for writing a bad review about a business but in this case I must.  Pedicures were pretty good, foot and leg massage was a little lacking but everyone's feet were nice and smooth afterwards.  The manicures were very lacking.  I paid extra for my nails to be buffed because as a man I don't like polish on my nails.  Not all of the nail bed was buffed and there was still a lot of skin on the nail bed close to the cuticles.  I pointed this out to the lady and after giving it a half hearted effort on one nail she said it would come off when I wash my hands which we both knew wasn't true.  I'm going to try I couple of more places that are highly recommended on Yelp and if I still find no joy I'm just going to have to do it myself or try the crazy expensive places.    I'm sick of $30-$35 dollar mani-pedi places that leave me more angry than happy.
5 After having a bad experience with another nail salon, I was reluctant to try this one. But I was not disappointed. I came as a walk-in and they took me in right away. Tina was sweet but hard to understand and it took a while before she understood what color I wanted. But when she did, she treated my nails like they were royalty. She shaped them perfectly without a single nick or cut and my nails look healthy and clean. I had this done about 2 weeks ago and the gel polish is still in mint condition on my nails, without even a single chip. Very happy with the results, for only $30!
