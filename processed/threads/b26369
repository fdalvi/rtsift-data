3 Okay, so you know this is your typical "Corner Store".   It seems that they buy a lot of their items from Sams or Costco and then sell them. Fine with me, keeps the cost of their items down compared to 7-11 or such.   They have a good variety of items that you might need from paperplates to bread. They have a full alcohol selection now too.  There is ALWAYS someone playing on the slots in there. I don't know how loose they are because I never play slots at a gas station or store.   Last time I tried to use my debit card they told me I had to spend $10 or I would incur a $1 service charge. I have not since then used my debit card there because boy did that make me upset. Highway robbery if you ask me!!   Don't get stuck in line when they are doing a shift change though. Talk, Talk, Talk is what they seemed to do.   I would give it a two but for the fast convienience they offer, I have to give it a 3. Plus it reminds me so much of the corner stores back east minus the slots.
3 Only lil' store back out here , so stock up !!...#Provisions
3 Just a block or so away from mi casa so I make some frequent late night snack runs here. It's a tiny store with a friendly staff. The sell just about every kind of alcohol you may need. Not much over on this side of town but it's more pleasant than the corner marts on boulder highway.
