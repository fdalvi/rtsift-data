5 My favorite park.  Always clean, super cute and big.  Authentically carved trees (D+A=Love kinda thing.)  And the ducks are always fun to feed!
4 Great little park, very family friendly. Could use a few more sets for little children and better lighting but during the day great place to have a picnic, and many families do. The baseball fields host adult softball and kickball leagues ( I was on one that one the city of Scottsdale). Very clean and safe feeling and I haved lived nearby for nearly a decade. Could perhaps use more facilities but other than a stroll or my ride along the Greenbelt I don't make great use of the park myself.
4 I like this park. People bike, jog, inline skating around the pond and a lot of people walk their dogs here. Its just nice. Not much more to it.. as it should be.
5 Since I explored this park I have not been able to force myself into the gym. So zen and peaceful and my favorite place to spend a Sunday afternoon.
5 Perfect weather for outdoor activities. They have disc golf here!
5 This is my favorite park in Scottsdale. It is located directly on the green belt and has plenty of room for activities. A great place to play a game of pickup anything.   I like to throw the ball for Oena/oenster/Bonester/Oenabologna at the baseball fields. Gotta make sure the coppers aren't hanging around the parking lot, but a great place to throw the ball otherwise.
4 Sweet walking paths. Loud in the toad mating season, though! Watch where you step!
