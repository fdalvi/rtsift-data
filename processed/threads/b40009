4 I ended up here today completely by accident. I was on the way to The Alchemy for a quick lunch when we noticed the sign. After scrambling to figure out if it was open (thank you, Facebook), we decided to head back. We live in the Atwood area and had NO idea this place was coming, let alone already open! I drive or bike by here almost every day and hadn't even noticed the building was being developed into something new. Anyway, I am really excited about a brew pub within walking/biking range of my house, especially since it seems like it is going to be a good one.  My first impression was that it felt very comfortable. There was a lot of space in the dining room when we walked in and I really liked the more "pub" like feel of this as opposed to some other spots that are doing a very industrial warehouse look. I love that their televisions are enclosed in cabinets with a pulley system to hide them away. From what their website says, they will only have them on during special events and things like that which is nice. The last thing Madison needs is another sports bar. The bar area felt nice, too, though we didn't sit over there.  The menu was pretty interesting. Standard appetizer fare such as cheese curds and fries joined some funky items such as a gourmet corn dog, locally sourced veggie and meat skewers, and sauerkraut sausage balls. We opted for the cheese curds because even if you get bad fried cheese curds, you are still eating a pile of delicious cheese. Verdict? Above average. I felt like they had great flavor but a bit too much breading and my dining partner thought they were good and that the dipping sauce was great.   For our main courses we went for the Yahara Burger and the Salmon Sandwich. The burger was great - juicy, flavorful, and very fresh tasting. The challah bun from Staltzy's Deli was a great choice. The included fries were OUTSTANDING. They say on the menu that they are hand cut. I assume that means they hand cut them in the shop, and if so that is damn impressive. Fresh fries seem to always be kind of soggy and chewy, but these were crisp and cooked perfectly. I was told the Salmon was good as well and she also really liked the fries.   Now, onto the important stuff! Beer. We both enjoyed our drinks. I ordered the Les, a tasty and mild ale. Very drinkable. She ordered the Wilbur!, a delicious cream ale. It reminded me of a more flavorful Spotted Cow. We were both very happy with our drinks. I really hope that they avoid the trend of every beer being super hoppy, and from our first visit it seems like they just might.   Overall I am super pumped about this place and I think they have a real shot of doing well. A menu loaded with just enough standards to keep people comfortable, but some fun twists to get others excited. A nice atmosphere. Good beer. Great location.   Yep, it's a keeper.
3 They definitely had some opening weekend hiccups.  Three people behind the bar, some making eye contact yet no one approached for a good 7 minutes.  Had to hold a mirror up to my face to make sure I didn't spontaneously turn invisible.  It's ok if you are busy and/or flustered but just an acknowledgement goes along way guys....  We sampled the WPA (Wisconsin Pale Ale) and the First Wort (A gold ale).  Both beers suffered from the same affliction.  Both had a good first taste but absolutely no finish.  While I would expect that from the Wort, the pale ale should have come through.    Will be stopping back in about a month to see if they work out the kinks and their second batch gets any better.
5 The beer is very good, with more to be tapped soon, and the food is much better than I imagined.  My favorites are the sausage balls and sweet potato crisps, both appetizers.  A pint of Sevex or WPA and those two is a perfect late afternoon happy hour meal.  I highly recommend Next Door and cannot wait to try their Sweet Wheat and IPA once they've been tapped.  There were definitely some opening day/weekend hiccups, as Bobb S. mentioned, but as far as I can tell, things are much improved a week later.  The service is much better and the food has improved as well.  They may have only been open a week, but Next Door is already my favorite place in the Atwood corridor!
2 I was very excited when I heard that we had a new brewery and restaurant in town, so I showed my wife the menu, and she got excited, too.  Unfortunately, our experience tonight did not live up to our hopes.  When we got there, no one was at the host station.  I flagged down a waiter, and he told me I should talk to the host, who was walking around somewhere.  The host came over, asked us how many we were, and sat us immediately after cleaning an open table.  We were very happy to be seated so quickly.  We got our menus, and ordered our first beers.  We'd been waiting for long enough at that point that we knew what we wanted for appetizers, so we ordered those, too.  We both also asked for glasses of water.  The beers came out a reasonable amount of time later.  We were both very impressed, and at that point we were convinced that we were in for a good experience.  I had the Sevex, which was pretty good, and my wife had the Wilbur, which we both liked a lot.  After about half an hour, our appetizers came out.  At this point, our waitress had not  checked on us once, and still had not taken our food order.  She set down our appetizers, took one of our food menus, and walked away before we could order our entrees.  We thought that was unusual.  For appetizers, we'd ordered the cheese curds and the pate.  The cheese curds were perfectly fine.  They weren't anywhere near the best I've had in town, but they were good--crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside.  The dipping sauce wasn't great, but the curds themselves were good.  The pate was strange.  Again, the pate itself was good, though my wife said she tasted an off metallic taste.  I didn't get that; I genuinely enjoyed it.  What I didn't enjoy, though, was that there was about a 1/4-inch-thick layer of semi-congealed fat on top of the pate itself.  I have no idea what it was, but it was gross.  It wasn't good, it wasn't rich, it wasn't warm, it was just as if someone had dumped fat on top of the pate.  It was unappetizing.  At this point, we still had not ordered food, though I'd had two beers, both of which were good.  Eventually, we did order food.  This was after nearly an hour in the place.  I ordered a standard burger, asking that they put cheese on top, and my wife ordered a chicken sandwich.  Both with fries.  I also ordered their onion soup.  Then we waited.  For about an hour.  And still did not have food.  Or water refills.  In fact, we didn't get silverware or napkins at any point during our meal.  What we did have was noise.  Lots of it.  The restaurant is larger than we expected, with concrete walls, and there were a lot of people, so it was just loud inside.  It was hard to hear each other from across the small table.  Several other groups were seated while we were waiting.  At some point, the waitress came over and apologized for the delay, and explained that the kitchen was swamped.  Honestly, that seemed plausible given how many people were in there.  But, eventually, my wife and I realized that no one was getting food.  Some people were getting appetizers, but no one was being served their entrees.    After what seemed like forever, we noticed that groups that had been seated after we'd put our food orders in got their entrees before we got ours.  That's when we really got frustrated.  A few minutes later, though, we finally got our food.  Except not really.  I had ordered the onion soup.  What I got was a bowl full of the gazpacho.  I explained this to our waitress, and she first insisted that that's what I had ordered, and then blamed it on the kitchen.  I told her I would skip the soup and she took it back.    My wife had ordered the chicken sandwich, which comes on a Stella's hot spicy cheese bread bun.  It was as advertised, except it wasn't very good.  My wife ate half of it out of grim determination, but couldn't get through it.  Her fries were cold.  Like, all the way cold.  My fires were hot, and they were delicious.  My burger was cooked perfectly, but it didn't have the cheese I'd asked for.  And it was just a bun with a patty on it; there wasn't anything else to it--not even condiments.  I took one bite, and it was just bland.  Not bad, just bland.  And I didn't get the soup I'd asked for, and my wife's food was terrible.  And my burger didn't have the cheese I'd asked for.   By this point, both my wife and I were done.  We'd been waiting for so long, and then our orders were wrong and the food we did get was mediocre overall.  I approached the host and explained the situation.  He apologized, and sent the waitress over, who offered to fix my burger.  Reluctantly, I let her take it.  While we were waiting, my wife and I considered our options, eventually deciding that we preferred to cut our losses on our food at Next Door and go to Five Guys instead.  So that's what we did--we paid our check and went and got Five Guys.  I want this place to succeed, but it just wasn't a good experience toni
5 I tried out the Next Door Brewing Company on a Friday, and I knew they recently opened so I was expecting a ton of people and slow service.   And that was what happened, but I was expecting that.  I had several of their beers and I thought they were pretty good.  I also had a pork and slaw sandwich which was very good.  Hopefully they can staff up for Thurs-Sat nights to keep things moving.  Also due to the stone walls, ceilings and floors it is very loud and had to hear.
4 So excited for a new place in my neighborhood!  It was pretty busy already beginning at 530 on a Friday.  As other reviewers said, it is very loud.  We just had a beer and some appetizers.  The food was good, especially the crisps with Chimchurri! I will definitely be back!
3 Good beer, good food, good service, good value. Very pleased with my meals, as I sampled a bit of many things. I'm a fan & I give 3 stars now, since I'm confident a few adjustments will put Next Door in the 4 to 5 star range. The fries weren't burnt, but they had that burnt flavor, like something was overcooked in the frying oil before. My MAIN COMPLAINT IS the LIGHTING! WHOA DUDE!!! Target called. They want their lighting back!!! A dimmer will do wonders for ambiance & mood. Next Door needn't be a dark, unwelcoming cave, but it doesn't need to be as bright as a mall jewelry store! I promise I'll be a frequent customer if the lights dim a bit. Seriously...  In other neighborhood eatery news... Hopefully Stalzy's will adjust prices a bit? Even though they have a friendly alliance with Next Door, if I have $10 in my pocket, I know I'll get a helluva lot more for my buck at Next Door. A delicious, well made burger with fries (not a la carte) vs an ehhh-made sammich, with salt, grease, a soggy pickle, & no change for a side? I think Next Door is a no-brainer.
3 Happy to have this place in our neighborhood, but they've got some bugs to work out.   We went there two consecutive nights (Friday and  Saturday). Friday just to try their beer and appetizers. Saturday for entrees.   Friday I would have given place 2 stars, but they redeemed themselves a little on Saturday to get 3. Not awesome but tons of room for improvement.  Positive: The service was great both nights. Seating options are well-designed. We like the communal seating at big and long tables, but there are options for private tables, a softball team area (the hipsters had claimed this area on Friday, and it was great to see them giving the place a chance), and bar seats too. Menu seems thoughtful. WPA (wheat pale ale?) is really nice. Local ingredients seem to be a priority. The Ssam Pork sandwich is really good with its kimchi slaw. Really nice logo, and great revitalization of a former dead space on Atwood Ave. OH, and the ketchup that that came with the fries - ! - thank you for not calling in Heinz. That $?!+ is awesome, but not quite the hook you need to get people back.  Negative: Dim the lights for christsake! It  feels more like Perkins than a neighborhood tavern. The cheese curds made us both a little ill - too greazy and the cheese is too soft (have the Baerwolf family at Sassy Cow advise you on a firmer cheese for deep frying, and densify your batter so it doesn't hold so much of the oil). It's also quite noisy. Two large rooms with hard walls, ceiling and floor make it an echo chamber and a little hard to talk unless you have good bar yell. Install some kind of noise dampening finishes.   We'll be back, but we'll give them some time to work out some of the newbie problems.
2 The only reason I am giving this a 2 instead of a 1 is because they just opened and the beer was tasty. But I found the atmosphere uncomfortable and lacking of any kind of  ambiance what so ever. The lighting is terrible, it very loud, and the seating is awkward.  The wait staff on both occasions took a long time to take our order and forgot the waters. I had a darker beer that was great the first time and an IPA I also enjoyed the second time. The first time I ordered the vegetarian tostadas and they were tolerable. Overly crunchy and fell apart and had an odd sweet taste to them. The second time my friend and I shared the crisps and cheese curds. The crisps were good but the  cheese curds were GROSS and definitely not vegetarian since I could taste that they had been dipped in the same batter as the fish. The were huge about the size of my fist and coated in the most disgusting fishy batter you could ever possibly imagine. I love cheese curds but these actually ruined curds for me, the word curd even turn my stomach now.  I really wanted to like this place as I work in the neighborhood and meet friends out for a beer and bite after work regularly.  There are a lot of good restaurants and brew pubs in this town, this one is not even close to par with any of the rest yet.  Chances are slim I will go back. If you eat meat and don't mind the uncomfortable atmosphere then you might love it though.
4 I've visited Next Door Brewing Co twice now, both times for lunch since it's closet to my office.  Our waitress on our first visit seemed very disconnected with the menu / specials and service was not that great.  On the second visit we were well taken care of and the staff was very friendly.  Both times the food was great and reasonably priced.
5 We had the opportunity to swing through this new brewery over the weekend. I am happy to report that the service was friendly and prompt, their beer was complex and delicious, the ambiance was very laid back and fun and they were playing great music. We only glanced at the food menu, but will definitely be back again to eat and try new beers. Their goal is to have a total of 11 taps, with about 3 being standards and 8 consistently rotating new brews and flavors. They also had 3 guest beers on tap. Great brewery, go check it out!
1 We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon. There were two or three tables and a half dozen people at the bar. We were instructed to sit wherever we liked, so we sat down at one of three tables in the bar area. I saw at least two serves walking around and one bartender. We checked out the beer menu, made our selections, and then waited. And waited. We sat there for five minutes and no one came to take our order, say hello, or offer us food menus. In the end we decided to walk a few blocks to the Harmony where the bartender doesn't pretend you're invisible.  I can be patient when it's busy and servers obviously have a lot on their plate. But this was not the case on Sunday afternoon. I'm disappointed because I was really excited about a brew pub opening up in our neighborhood. I'll give them another shot in a month or so. Hope they work out their staff issues by then.
2 Good:  Decent beer (Sevex was really good the Wilbur was mediocre) and better than average food (I shared the poutine and had the Sassy Chicken Sandwich).  The Servers were friendly.  Bad:  You feel like you are in a repainted VFW hall.  The ceilings are concrete, so it sounds like everyone is yelling next to you.  The service was really slow.  2 hours for apps and dinner was more than I expected.  Entrees took ~40 minutes to come out on a Wednesday when the place was mostly empty.
5 Very good, fresh beer, with a good variety of styles, from black IPA to the tasty Wilber! cream ale. We tried two appetizers: The sausage and sauerkraut balls, and the poutine, both excellent pub fare. We'll be back for the burgers and pulled pork sandwich. Definitely worth a return visit. We were there on a week night, so it wasn't real crowded or loud. The place is attractive, with taupe walls, polished wood, and candles on the tables. We felt welcome and well cared for.
1 I am so glad that we didn't order more from them. We had the mixed shishkabob plate, the sausage and kraut balls, and split the Atwood burger. My partner had a beer. The shishkabobs were under-seasoned and over cooked, the only one either of us enjoyed at all was the sausage one, probably because you can't mess up sausage too badly. The burger was the same story. They advertise onions and caraway seeds and other yummies on that burger. What came out of the kitchen was an undersized patty with a few caraway seeds in the entire thing and a tiny smudge of onions on top. We expected something much more flavorful and powerful. The beer, I was told was excellent for the first few sips and then started to leave a bad taste in his mouth. A third of the way through the glass and he would have thrown it away if we had been at home. Now those things I could forgive for a new place but here is the kicker. The pork sausage and sauerkraut were over done on the outside and raw on the inside. When I told the waiter to let the kitchen staff know that their frier was too hot (I have been frying for 10 years), he let them know and then came back and told us that the balls were supposed to be pink on the inside. I'm curious. How can a product comprised of a brown or green vegetable and a meat that is brown when properly cooked, be pink unless it was raw? Not only is that wrong, but that is a safety issue. We will not be going back and we will not be recommending it to anyone. Save yourself some money and possibly illness and avoid this place.
3 To start, i wont order food here again. It was overpriced and not amazing, actually my burger was the worst burger i have ever ordered anywhere but my bf's chicken sandwich was good, not worth the price, but at least good. Beer i was informed was good, but it took a long time to get my food and yeah, the burger with swiss and carmalized onions was a disgrace to burgers everywhere
4 Stopped in for a late noon lunch.   Ordered the Ssam Pork sandwich.   It came with french fries that where Great.   the sandwiches roasted pork was tender and tasty.  But the kinchi sauce was a bit mild for me.   Get extra napkins for this juicy sandwich.   We will be going back to try the custom brews and more menu selections.   The manager even stopped by our table to make sure we where happy and satisfied.
3 Met up with a friend for a quick brew and a light bite on 11/30/13 - last opportunity for #yelpnewvember.  + Arrived at around 5:45pm, plenty of seats available at the bar (and tables) + Lighting was comfortable + Sound deadener under bar stools helped keep some of the echo/ring/harshness down  + TVs surrounded the bar; playing college football - Appeared to have a problem getting music to play over PA system while keeping TVs active. They fixed it after about 5-6 songs with blank television  +/- Staff was generally aloof; bartenders weren't very personable - they hugged the back of the bar  +/- Tried two distinct beers - one was great, the other not so much - Fish fritters weren't what I had expected; probably my bad, but they reminded me of whitefish cakes (think crab cakes but with whitefish). Aioli helped a ton. I envisioned something like a fish nugget - a small chunk of cod or something.  - Pricey. 2 full beers, 1 7oz beer, and the fish bites came to $20, without tip. Seemed a bit excessive to me.  - Parking lot was extremely difficult to get out of; not really the fault of the place - it's the nature of having a biz in the Schenck/Atwood neighborhood. I'd recommend parking on the street if you can - it's free and much easier to get in and out of.  I need to go back a few more times, and will; I'll update accordingly after a few more visits. I have high hopes!
3 A work in progress but definitely worth a visit. I had stopped by alone one afternoon and chatted with the owner. I was so impressed with his dedication to making his customers happy. Though it is hard to hear folks complaints he takes them to heart and does something about it. No arrogance just a commitment to excellence.  I returned the Wednesday before Thanksgiving about 5 pm. We had no trouble finding a table but the place filled up quickly after our arrival. There were 5 of us and i had no trouble hearing over the din. The waitstaff was helpful and attentive.   We started with the Crisps (strips of yam) which were crunchy and delicious. I especially liked the herby chimmichuri sauce that accompanied the potatoes. I tasted bot the White Onion Soup and the Butternut Squash soup. The squash soup was the clear winner for me. I thought the onion soup was too cheesy (I am not a WI native) and lacked umami. The squash soup was sweet and delicate. Yum.  My sister and her husband stated that the salmon sandwich was good, not great. They are gourmands of sort so they may be mighty picky.  I am not one to review beer. I like it but just do not know enough to rate it. The Wilbur was good but my brother-in-law preferred the Willy. That's all I know.  I live close by and am sure to return. I want to try their salads and some other beers. My son did have an Old Fashioned and he liked it just fine. I enjoyed the neighborhood ambiance and the attitude of the the staff.   I hope to add an extra star in the near future. Check back soon for an update.
3 Solid first attempt with enough excitement to return. While the food menu didn't make me jump up and down, I dug the atmosphere and the tap line. Next time I want to go past snacks and give the reg menu a whirl, then update. A super awesome addition to the hood though. Once I'm certain will continue to gain in popularity over time!
5 I stopped in at Next Door on a Friday evening around 8 to meet up with some friends for a few beers and some munchies. I had initially talked to the host when I walked in, thinking that maybe I would get a table for my friends and I (I was early). He said there might be a 20 minute wait, so I gave him my name and headed over to the bar. Inside ten minutes he came over to offer a table, but I had found some seats by the window overlooking the brewing room with the vats and color-changing lights (trippy!), so I was OK for the moment. He even came back a few minutes later just to make sure my friends and I were comfortable with where we were at. So basically their host kicks butt.   The beer (I believe all of which are House of Brews creations) was pretty great. I tried their Doe Eyed Brown, which had caramel notes on the finish with a nice mouth-feel (aka tasty). Then it was on to the S.S. Badger, their steam ale, which was crisp and tasty (think Anchor Steam). I also had their Egg Nog Sweet Stout, which I was initially apprehensive about, thinking it might have an overly-sweet vanilla thing going on - but no! Creamy, coffee-ish, with a hint of vanilla, and with fresh nutmeg grated on top, this beer was the highlight of our evening.   The snacks were de.light.ful. We had the eggs two ways (deviled and pickled with juice, both delicious), the sauerkraut sausage balls (which has a crispy exterior and a remoulade dipping sauce and were savory and great), and the poutine (made with thick-cut fries, a peppery gravy, Sassy Cow creamery cheese curds, topped with slices of green onion...I was in my own fatty paradise).   All of the three-star review people should give this place another go-round - I think their game has been stepped up.
4 I went to Next Door for the first time this past week, and I really liked it. Nice decor and even though I was with a large group, service was efficient and friendly. I didn't order any food but I tried someone's fried cheese curds (obviously no match for the reining champ on the square, but that's a pretty high bar).  They have a lot of good house brews - I really like stouts and their eggnog stout was fantastic.
5 Quoted from my daughter: " This place gets 2000 thumbs up" If that is not a compliment, I don't know what is.  All three generations of my family LOVED their  experience at Next Door Brewing Company.   We ordered an Atwood Burger, Yahara Burger and the Sassy Bird Sandwich.  All came with the most delicious french fries.  I have no picture of them because they were all eaten and devoured so quickly.  My father ate his entire plate of food so quickly and washed it down with a nutty brown beer, I haven't seen him eat that quickly in ages.  My daughter loved her Yahara burger with the Challah bun.  My sassy bird chicken sandwich was perfect, moist chicken, perfect bun and yes, those darn french fries again. Before leaving my quotable daughter mentioned to the waiter she would like to come back every day.  So all in all here's what you need to know.   Delicious food and beer.  Great space for groups at the larger tables or there are some smaller table groupings.  In the bloody freezing weather of Wisconsin, this place was warm and toasty.  Children will be happy campers although they did not have a kids menu. See you again Next Door!
5 By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had! Crispy with a melted inside that was fresh and phenomenal. Great flavor and epitome of a good cheesecurd! Corndog was delicious with fresh homemade breading with a wonderful sausage inside! Only complaint was how spicy our Mac n cheese was (made with cayenne pepper we were later informed!!) without any warning on the menu which could have been bad if it was a go-to for kids. Friendly service and to die for food, can't wait to bring friends back!
5 This is a great neighborhood brewery.  With many places popping up with new construction, I really enjoy the feel of this place having converted an old building and adding a ton of character.  The staff is great, I always feel welcomed and taken  care of.  The place can get busy, but I've never turned back.  Busy is good, in my opinion.  The food is fantastic, everything is always fresh and tasty, and sourced locally when possible...gotta respect that!  The beer is exceptional.  Brewer Keith can often be found performing "quality control" and is really good about discussing everything beer.  It's a nice touch for people who are curious about the process.
4 Had a nice meal at Next Door the other night. This was my second time there, my first time was just for a beer shortly after they opened so I wanted to get back in and check it out.   It seemed less industrial and more 'moved-in' which was nice. The space is very cool and unique.   Their food menu was exciting, lots of options that I wanted to try. I had a pulled pork sandwich with kimchee, it was good but would have liked more spice. A friend had the beer mac and cheese, I tried it and it was delicious.   I'll be back to try more of the menu!
4 I came to Next Door Brewing Company with high hopes-and left a little disappointed. They get four stars only because of the attentive, friendly waitstaff and the fact I really enjoyed their seasonal Holiday Beer (I forgot the name), the food deserved a 2.   Otherwise, the food was awful--maybe it was just an off day.  My son had their mac and cheese-and was disappointed. I had the sassy bird sandwich--the chicken breast was a little overdone and smothered in too much sauce.  Bun was so-so.  Cheese curds were passable.
4 We stumbled onto this place back in early January at a late afternoon and non-weekend hour.   We used to live a lot closer and would have spotted it a lot earlier in those days.  I thought it was another coffee joint, but wife knew better.  We went in to check it out and were glad we did.  No raucous music and no TV set emphasis.  Good start.  Friendly atmosphere and we were greeted as though we were welcome and not just interlopers.  Tried a flight to see how they brew.  I was thankful to find a brewer that doesn't use maximum hops to cover up all his mistakes.  They have good choices and any beer guy should be able to find something to his liking.  I didn't take notes, and this review is a few weeks after the fact, but I thought the place needs some promoting.  It is a great neighborhood brew pub and bar, and we will be back at some point.  The only food memory that I have at this point is the eggs.  Pickled eggs were great and significantly better than the deviled ones.  Good luck, Next Door.  We wish you all the best.  Will be back with my son-in-law who is a real Beer Guy.
3 I went to Next Door Brewing for an after work gathering.   Parking - skip the tiny parking lot. It's a mess trying to get in and out of it. There is plenty of street parking all around the area.  Atmosphere - it was ok. It's a big open space that feels kind of bland.   Beer - as it's a microbrewery, I tried their sampler. It was also ok. I can't say I loved any of the beers nor were any of them horrific.  Food - it was ok. They have big, beautiful cheese curds but they aren't very flavorful. I also had their Atwood Burger which was, you guessed it, ok.  Service - was right in line with the rest of the experience. It was ok. It certainly wasn't terrible service but I wouldn't go out of my way to say it was good either.   I didn't find anything about my experience at all remarkable. If I have friends who want to go here, I won't object as it's not awful. But I would never suggest or recommend it. If I give it another try in the future and things are different, I'll definitely update this review.
5 Neighborhood bar with good beer.  We liked the fish fritters, pickled vegetables, Sasy Bird chicken sandwich and squash soup.  Nice dinner out for me and the wife.
4 Ate lunch here. Had the wpa, which was a cross between a pale ale and an IPA. Food was excellent- had the veggie tostada and the white bean burger (a special that day but hope they keep it). Both were tasty!
2 DO NOT ORDER THE CHEESE CURDS. Seriously, worst cheese curds in Madison. They had too much bland, cake-y batter that overpowered the very mild curds, which I think were inside the batter, but they were so melted it was just goo (Not enough cheese in the cheese curd - how is that even possible?) Even the side sauce was disappointing - watery and bland.   I really wanted to like this place - big tables, large selection of homebrewed beer, photos of the Atwood neighborhood around town. Atmosphere is nice, sadly the food is meh. I had the salmon sandwich, which was more like a mayonnaise-y salmon salad. It was alright after adding some salt.   The beer is the highlight of this place, lots of selection and they offer beer flights for tasting and figuring out your favorites.
4 Just tried Next Door Brewing Co.on a week night last week. The ambiance is great, hard wood floors, smaller but nice bar and a windowed off area where you can see the brewing equipment. Not sure if they are still figuring out staffing, but our service was incredibly slow. The staff was nice but we waited a long time to even have someone come over with waters and take our order. I had the white chicken chili which was on special that day and it was great! The portion size was huge, especially considering the low price I paid for it. Will definitely come back on a weekend and try some of their drinks.
5 Wonderful place. The food was outstanding, the service was quite friendly and very helpful. The stout made it in my top 5. The wood bar was very nice, which added to the overall homey feel to the place. Next door indeed. You can also see the entire brewing room, which was neat as they were working in their during my visit. My gf and I had a wonderful experience and definitely recommend it.
3 I'm eager to return since I swung by for a happy hour with a friend.  We happily sampled their brews... I'll be back for that White IPA.   Food: The house corn dog gave me hope. The poutine did not. The mix & match skewers rocked. Highly recommend the mushrooms and the sausage, but wouldn't suggest the hearts unless you're obsessed with them in some way.   I fell in love with the setup table-wise. As a planner of meetings, I seriously dug the ginormous tables that could seat large groups. And the best part is they have more than one giant table. (Smart move Next Door, now I want to fill one of 'em!)  I'm looking forward to returning for a full meal and will update my review when I get the chance!
3 I went for Brunch to this place a couple of Sundays ago.   Upon entering I was really surprised at how quiet this place was for a Sunday afternoon given the location. They have mostly large tables aka communal seating. Since the other half of my party was already seated, we joined them- and were greeted by the waitress quickly. Service throughout the meal was very nice.   The meal itself had hits, but also misses.  The cheese curds were AWESOME. My husband's chicken and waffles good. But my pulled pork sandwich with kimchi was a disappointment- seriously lacking in flavor. The Burger was not outstanding. The Veg tostada my mother in law tried was good.   Overall I would return to this place, but with so many outstanding locations near by, it might be a while.
4 This place was a great find for a Sunday afternoon lunch. I had the sassy bird chicken sandwich which was delicious! It has Brie cheese and this orange sauce that made the sandwich perfectly unique and delicious!   My boyfriend had the monte cristo sandwich off of the brunch menu, which was yummy but what really made the plate was the grilled & salted red skin potatoes and a mustardy, horseradishy, raspberry vinigarette! Holy yum!   The atmosphere was nice and I really liked the music they had on on the background (Nora jones style).  Waitstaff was nice and had good recommendations for foods to try.   Only drawbacks I could find....  I thought the appetizers were unfairly priced. I would have liked to try the fried cheese curds or the poutine but the cost of those was almost as must as my sandwich meal. If they dropped the price of these a bit my rating would be a full 5 stars! :-  Overall, I really liked this place and will go back for another visit!
3 Super excited to try this place! The decor was fantastic. They did a great job of mixing masculine and feminine, old and new. Easily a place to hunker down and stay a while. It took a while to get service, however, once we had, our server was attentive and polite. Being new to the place, my husband and I both ordered beer flights. (They are not listed on the menu, but they do have them.) It was basically pick 4, so between the two of us we sampled 8 of their brews. They were decent. Some had a strange after taste and some almost tasted like fruit infused beers. If this is your thing-drink up. I wasn't such a fan. I thought the flavors were strange-not bad- just different. The food was the same. I had the whitefish and potato cakes and my husband had pulled pork. Both dishes had strong middle eastern/ oriental flavors. They were also strange. It again almost seemed like a poor attempt at american/ middle eastern/ oriental fusion.   In short, if you are into middle eastern/ oriental flavors and fruit infused beers, this is your place. If you are looking to go a little more traditional, I would head some place else.
4 Went here for a beer on a Saturday afternoon and think this place is pretty cool. Super close to where we live and the beers weren't bad. They could use a couple more lighter style beers to satisfy those of us who don't like heavy IPAs. I definitely want to come back and try the menu
3 Stopped in for a flight of tasters. Sampled 5 in total, all of which were good. The best was Arch Nemesis. There was a smaller tasting room along with larger seating areas. I had some beer battered cheese curds which were just OK.   It's a short walk to One Barrel so hit both if you are out tasting.
2 We stopped in Friday for their new fish fry.   We both had the perch.   We both felt it was at best unremarkable.   The lake perch were small and overdone so there was no flakiness to them.   The fries were good.  The small slaw side was tasteless.   The Belgian IPA I tried was the best Next Door beer I've had here in a number of visits.   I'd rate it 5/10 on a scale of Belgian IPA's I've tried.   Overall an unexciting visit.   I would not earmark the place for any sort of visit.   I hope they succeed but they really need to get in touch with what people expect!    Madison has a great array of beckoning places...Next Door doesn't inspire return visits.
