5 Dr Noorda used to be in a location on Eastern but moved to this MUCH nicer location a couple of years ago.  I first started seeing him on the recommendation of an old boss after I chipped my heel in what can only be described as a freak accident. It involved my dog, a reclining chair and a Christmas tree... But I digress...  I have had screwed up feet for years because of the Converse Chuck Taylors I wore growing up. I liked Dr Noorda so much that after the freak accident, I started seeing him on a regular basis for my flat, screwed up feet.  His staff is remarkably efficient. I have never waited in the waiting room or the patient room for more than five minutes.Dr Noorda spends time with you as if you were his long-lost buddy and has an almost eerie recollection of details from previous visits. When I told him I was planning to run a 5k he gave me some great advice on what type of shoes to get for my type of feet and how to break them in.  He will also try to give you the most efficient/inexpensive treatment plan possible. He never tries to "upsell" and will gladly give you tips and tricks to help with whatever issues you may have. All this and a fantastic sense of humor, too.
4 Dr. Noorda is the BEST!  You will likely have to wait past your appointment time but he makes up for it by not rushing through your appointment.  Staff is super and went out of their way to meet my needs.
