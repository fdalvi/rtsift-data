5 This company, headed by Molly Barber, has been cleaning my home for over three years and I am consistently pleased with the results. Communication is excellent, scheduling changes are easy to arrange from both sides, and I am more than comfortable providing access when I am not at home.  I have recommended the company to several friends who are all equally satisfied. Highly recommend.
5 Molly and American Maid are the best cleaners around! Your house will shine and smell great! Molly returned my shower back to move in condition.  I love not having to scrub my shower!! If you're looking for a great cleaning service, look no further. Great prices, great cleaning & a great owner!! I highly recommend Molly, you'll be impressed!
5 Lori and Molly took such great care of us! I called on a Tuesday night and desperately needed condo cleaning on a Wednesday. Lori rearranged their whole schedule so that Molly could come help us out! They did an amazing job. Molly had cleaned the shower 3 times by the time I spoke with her!!! Lori kept me posted throughout the day (condo needed a lot of help and they wanted to make sure I was ok with charges). Very friendly, very accommodating -- they will be my GO TO company. Thanks ladies!!!!
