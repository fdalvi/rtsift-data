4 Always predictable, value menu always good.
4 Always purchases from the dollar menu.  Fast service and hot food, can't beat that.
1 No one should EVER be able to sit in the drive-thru and write a review on Yelp while waiting for their order! There is no GOOD reason why it's taking this long. My goodness! And don't just throw my food and money at me! And these cold ass fries! Im so glad I dont eat this bs any more! Holy cow!
4 Nothing wrong with this restaurant. I mean it's McDonald's... pretty consistent and everyone was great!
