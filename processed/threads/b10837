5 Called this place 4 hours before a show at The Pearl on a Saturday night ("artist" will remain anonymous cuz I am too freakin embarrassed to say...they weren't for me..honest!!).  They were selling them at face value!!  So I definitely would tell anyone to give this place a shot for last minute tix!
1 Horrible outfit, purchased tickets on line ~ was under very short window to receive tickets and was requested to fax copy of credit card, my drivers license etc?? Received email that tickets were coming Fed-Ex, they never arrived. Told me to pick up at their office - told them to pound sand and was informed of some tiny small print.  Charges were reversed (yeah Mastercard), crappy business that seems WAY shady to me!!!!
5 Great prices on the shows you want to see. Check here before buying online at full price.
2 I highly recommend that you avoid this establishment at all cost.  They troll Craigslist for leads, then suggest a 10% discount (i.e. after marking up prices with 10%..) and will then promise local delivery.  In every country and venue, that means will call.  Not for VIP tickets: they will charge you $15 and you have the choice between: #1 Driving down to their office way off the strip, during business hours #2 A bunch of ridiculous hurdles for factual delivery to your hotel (think copies of credit cards, drivers license, signed releases etc).  All bogus stuff so you pretty much have to default to #1 above.    Knowing I wasn't going to "win" this I just bit the bullet and did #1 by going to their office.  When I confronted them about their practice, they did not argue further but immediately refunded the token $15.  So for that they get 2, instead of 1, stars :)
