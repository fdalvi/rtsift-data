5 Very clean spacious thrift store with super affordable prices. We bought a huge bag full for under $18-books-movies-clothing-etc. The people working there were very nice as well. Senior day monday-save 30% what a deal~
5 I almost didn't want to write a review because this is one of those places you just want to keep to yourself! It is probably the most organized thrift store in the valley, always clean and easy to find what your looking for. They have the best prices around  i can usually walk out with a few outfits for 20 bucks! They employees are all really friendly and eager to help if needed. My favorite thrift store hands down!
4 Very clean and well stocked as far as clothing goes. Mondays are Senior day. Great low prices and the staff was very friendly and helpful. However there were not alot of housewares, or furniture from what I could see.   I will be back
5 They have quite a selection of clothes n random items. I found a michael jackson lp for a buck... A m-f'ing dollar! Recommend it.. As a college student on a budget, this is the way to go.
