4 I happened to be at Boulder Station this morning and in need of a cup of coffee.  It was a perfect day for one as it was cold outside; I was feeling lethargic and beat down.  So my need of caffeine is excusable.  Anyhow, I like this little place.  It wasn't really busy and since I am not one for the GRANDE NON FAT MOCHA MAMA FOOKA'S WITH 1/2 CAF. DECAF AND WHIPPED CREAM ON THE SIDE, a regular drip was my order.  So, Starbucks is Starbucks.  Decent service with a smile in a welcoming well lit environment.  So, all I can tell you is my experience while sipping on my coffee.  I got my cup and sat out in front of Starbucks at a little table and watched everyone walk by me as they were heading to the buffet.  The only noise I heard was the slot machines trying to entice you to play and the sound of footsteps walking by.  I was able to get a little revitalized and get on with my day.  What else do you need?
3 the staff was pretty nice. just the standard. nothing special. i ordered my fave at the moment ice caramel macchiato. so good! i was there on sunday and they closed so early about 9pm. not sure of the other days of the week. it was a small place inside boulderstation . def will be back if im nearby.
5 Staying in Boulder Station, Starbucks is the perfect place to grab a coffee or a light snack!  Been there twice now, first time I grabbed a caramel Lattae and pumpkin bread (which is to die for) and just today I got a Strawberry smoothie and a oatmeal biscuit (cookie).  I wasn't sure with the drink, after describing how I felt they offered the strawberry smoothie which was perfect, and while there I picked up one of their amazing coffee mugs for my mother as a gift.  While the cashier seemed new (unsure on prices and location of certain items) he did his best to help, and he succeeded in that, and the older lady who works there is so sweet  Even though it's amongst bars, cigarets and slot machines, it just provides that little escape from it it all!
