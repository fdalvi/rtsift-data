3 Ahh, my beloved yet loathed ghetto-ass Target.   You are the ugly stepsister to my Cinderella Desert Ridge location.  You're there when I need trash bags and cleaning agents, but that's about it.  You're small, have a small selection of items, and can sometimes have a gross sketchy crowd.   I like you because you've stuck it through the light-rail headaches.   But I'll like you even more when you move to fancier digs on Bethany Home....
3 Out with the old. In with the new. FINALLY, the Target (read Tarjhay, in case ur not in the know, and if ur not, what cave have u been living in?)...on Camelback and 7th Ave. is going Super Store at  nearby location. Happy about the remodel and upgrade. Not so happy at the SUPER store status. I'm NOT into the super/great/mega store deal. I want specific places to get my specific goods. Like when I'm grocery shopping I'm not looking for lawn chairs, end tables and Arizona souviner T-shirts. I"m looking for boneless, skinless chicken breasts, overpriced olive oil a 6 pack discount on a Bonny Doon wine deal. Meanwhile this Target is (purposefully) running out of things and is short on amiable, clever responses to the inevidable question of their reopening.
