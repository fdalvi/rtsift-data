4 From the moment we pulled up the line guys were exceptionally friendly and were very attentive to our needs. The facilities were being cleaned during our stop over but they were more than accommodating. The pilot lounge was very comfortable with a sleep room and several recliners and full Dish Network.  They had a couple of crew cars, dodge stratus i think, the one we got smelled a little bit like smoke but who the hell cares?  Reasonable fuel prices and cute desk girls make this a complete FBO experience.
5 Class act here. We in today with our C421 (N21GF)  for college football game. Top of line service for all our needs. Rent car brought out plane-side for our use. Line service very attentive to all our requests and anticipations. Nice lobby for pax and crew needs. One of the better service stops we have been into...ever. Today was a test for all the staff here because of the heavy traffic coming in for ball game. They were on top of things for sure. Thanks folks. Really well done.
5 I've flown in here 4 times on some dinner trips from Chicago.  Some of the best service I have ever gotten from an FBO and the facility is quite nice.  This is one of my favorite places to go for a 100 dollar hamburger run.
