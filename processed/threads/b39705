5 So excited to give a good report. We tried the BBQ chicken wings, Bratwurst, and 1/3 lb burger with mushrooms and cheddar cheese with fries. Ingredients are fresh, never frozen. Sauce made in house.  Brats made in house daily from quality ingredients. Burgers are hand formed from Angus beef in house daily. Wings are hand breaded and sauced, never frozen. Buns are fresh. Chef-owner is culinary graduate and a veteran with a Purple Heart. Restaurant has plenty of space for any occasion and is casual. About the result: our meal was heavenly delicious. Please support this wonderful, hand-crafted food. San Tan Valley, you have a winner!!!
