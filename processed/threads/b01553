1 Absolutely repulsive attitudes with no help whatsoever. Needed help and no one could give me a straight answer. Came back to store to return something, and the cashier was on the phone and would not help with my return. Finally after waiting forever she returned my internet purchased items and gave me store credit.  She also told me i could not use my store credit online which is where i would need to purchase my items since no store within 50 miles had my size. I was a bit upset. Went home, and looked on the back of the card she gave me for store credit and it says i can use this card in store OR ONLINE.  Please, know what your saying before you give off false info to your customers.   Paradise valley wet seal, i will definitely not be returning. And have your employees smile every once in awhile.. Instead of looking like a sticks up their butt.
5 A great place to shop minus the unfortunate occurrence of ex-employees who created drama on the job, and off (such as on here). A great environment, with great deals. Ask any of the girls if you need help and make sure to check back constantly for new deals! :)
5 Awesome customer service! The two girls yesterday working the register were so fast and efficient getting their line down. I also did a return and they both made it simple and not complicated. I got help trying to find what I needed and the girl working the dressing room was very speedy too. Love this wet seal!
