3 I'm so proud to say my university has its own cinema room, situated in the student Union building of Pleasance. Members of the film society get a great deal on movies shown during the academic year. I'm not a member of the society, but was there to see a screening of Slumdog Millionaire...awesome movie!  Anyway, the room is quite big for it's purpose and seats over two hundred people. The film quality was also quite impressive, and whilst the movies won't be the latest blockbusters, the choice of films on the society brochure is extremely diverse!   During fresher's week, I also had the great experience of seeing one of my favourite Disney films, Aladdin in the courtyard! A bunch of us were huddled on the benches and the floor, with blankets and warm drinks. I believe they are a few screenings like this during the year, and I'd definitely recommend it, if it isn't too cold ofcourse!
4 Despite it's location just minutes from the city centre, The Pleasance has an almost remote and out of town feel to it, only really seeming to come to live during The Fringe when every insufferable moron under the sun comes out of the woodwork. During the rest of the year, Edinburgh Uni have their own cinema out here, and it's exactly as you'd imagine a university cinema to be.  Small, not great on facilities, but the only place in town you're likely to see some 1920s Karl Marx documentary followed by Legally Blonde. It has a suitably fascinating lineup that makes it always worth a quick shifty.
4 Who knew Edinburgh University had a cinema? Not me....!!  But then again maybe I was better off without knowing that....to be honest it's going to disappoint you. I was expecting blockbusters, new releases, popcorn even....alas, it's not to be.  For what it is, however, it's pretty good. Definitely looking into, and supports the University. It's big and the people there are friendly, but it's no Vue or Odeon..!
