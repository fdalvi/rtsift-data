3 The Baguette Company has all the makings of a good take away. Fast service, fresh food clean shops, little area where you can wait out the rainstorm (it's scotland!).  So whats the problem? I can get exactly the same experience at a Baguette Express and for a little cheaper. But we can't fault them for trying. Good food if your close by, but a little late to the tough world of baguette retail.
4 The Baguette Company stands out on Dalry Road for being that bit more up to date than the majority of the other cafes and takeaways.  It's clean, fresh, modern and spacious for a place largely utilised for its takeaway menu. They sell soft baguettes for reasonable prices, with a decent amount of toppings. The fillings themselves are rated highly by me - it's not the kind of place where they dollop the mayo on in an overzealous fashion.  A lunch in here will fill you up without making you feel bloated. I'd rather take my business here than to any Baguette Express or Subway since it's that bit better. No complaints, and very handy for people commuting from Haymarket Station!
