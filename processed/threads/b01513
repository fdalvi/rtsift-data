2 so i went through the drive-thru today, and upon ordering 3 burgers and two with just ketchup and cheese, the "Se hablo espanol" working the mic kept ringing them up as "ketchup/no mustard" and repeated it back like 3 times,  after saying she didn't know how to get the order right because they got a new system (NOT MY PROBLEM!) doesn't give them an excuse to mess up my order! anyway we also ordered a "caramel apple sundae" the muchacha even repeated it back as "caramel apple sundae" then rang it up as a "hot fudge sundae" (not what i ordered!) then upon getting to the window they hand me a hot fudge sundae, after telling them about it, they go and get a caramel apple sundae with maybe an inch of ice cream and light caramel drizzle. at other McDonald's i get about 2-3x as much!!! i guess i wont be going back to this one for a while (at least until the estupido learns the "new system")
1 Don't take your "Gold Card" here it"s not accepted per mgr. We bought the card for $20 to support the kids from a local high school and this McDs refused  it.  The card gives you a free cone with any purchase.  The cone probably costs mcds 5 cents to make.  All other mcds that i've been to accepts it.
2 Usually this Mcdonald's is not too bad. However, the orders and wait time has gotten pretty bad lately. Tonight, I waited in line at the drive-thru for 10 minutes before I could order.  So, I order some apple pie's with my meal and I am told it will take 10 minutes to cook them. Okay, so I order two hot fudge sundaes and I get home and realize they have put some bitter chocolate sauce on the sundaes instead of hot fudge. This has happened before. If someone pays you for a product, why don't you provide it?  My opinion of this McDonald's location is has really taken a dive down.
