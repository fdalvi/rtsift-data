3 Quick and very friendly. They have lots of mags and they do a great job of scheduling appointments and following up.
5 Hard to give a dentist 5 stars but they are on time, easy to get an apmt, great chair-side manner, and profesional results.
5 We really like there appointment reminder e mail that they send to us about our up comming appoinments.  We have been using Dr Thomas for our Dental Care for 3 years now and think that he is excellent.  The location is about 1 mile from our house, his office is very clean and modern, and his staff very friendly and professional.
5 This office is wonderful! Friendly staff, great appointment reminders and a very competent and friendly dentist. I would recommend Dr. Thomas to anyone looking for a dentist! Tammy in the front office is very friendly and has taken the time to know the clients and even helps with my kids while I have my Invisalign checked and changed every two weeks. I can't say enough great things about this office!!
2 The dental assistant was great but I wish I could say the same for the dentist. I may be old school but I like to know the name of my dentist and at least have them shake my hand and maybe even introduce himself. When he was done examining my teeth which took approximately 45 seconds he didn't even talk to me about what he found. Not my type of etiquette. Will be looking elsewhere.
