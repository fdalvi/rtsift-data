5 I have been a little deflated with a couple of my favorite boutiques disappearing right along with my mutual fund valuation. Then while hunting for auction items for ANLC, I  stumbled into Elan, fun, unique, perfect for goin' out in AZ casual style!  Lisa is georgous and creative, she even makes some of the great Jewelry they sell and can arrange one-of-a kind pieces!! Elan is worth an afternoon, check it out!!
5 I came across this gem when AZ hosted the superbowl. I had what seemed like a million parties to attend and not much time.  I bought the most phenomenal earrings ever.  Extravagant gift to myself but they were so worth it.. Long story short had a small accident that weekend and took them back to the store..the owner Lisa fixed them for me like new.   the past few years I have been shopping here sometimes for indulgent gifts for myself or cute budget minded outfits. There is something for every mood my wallet and I happen to be in.   The owner Lisa is fantastic and knows my taste down cold.  Recently she showed me an outfit I wasn't too excited about on Kim Kardashian I tried it on just because Lisa swore I would love it!  Kim does it NO JUSTICE.......I LOVE IT!!!  I can't say enough about the jewelry either.. I stop through prior to my Miami & Vegas trips and always find something sexy, but classy!!  This place rocks for the casual to the bold!! (ME)! ;-)
4 One of my favorite boutiques in Scottsdale, I can always find something I don't need but have to have at Elan.  Lisa and her entire staff are friendly, helpful, and always have great suggestions.  They keep the inventory fresh and edgy.  Some of the pieces I've gotten there never fail to get compliments.  It can be a little pricy, but everything I've gotten there is well-made and things I'll wear again and again so... Lisa puts on some great events and really engages with her customers.
