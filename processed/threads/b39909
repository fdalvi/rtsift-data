4 I never visited Kushi's before it moved from Victoria Street, so I don't have the basis of comparison that others have quoted.    I've certainly found the service to be very friendly and efficient, and there's plenty of choice. I've mainly had lunches there on occasions when Home Bistro across the road has been closed, plus the occasional pre-theatre evening meal. All fairly conventional Indian cuisine, but perfectly acceptable, and the pricing is very reasonable.
