4 Located in Ocean Terminal, is another branch of smoothie bar Juiced Up. As I have mentioned in other reviews, I find fruit a bit of a hassle to eat and apples just make my teeth sore so a smoothie just makes way more sense. You can eat, well drink your five a day in one fell swoop, no drama, no hassle, just a tasty smoothie.  If I'm on a shopping spree in Ocean Terminal, which I've been doing more than I should have recently then I'll often get a smoothie to give me a little boost... shopping is tiring, you know. I'm not a big fan of citrus fruits so berries usually suit me fine and there's a huge selection available to order here but I usually get a mix of raspberries, strawberries and cranberries with an apple thrown in for good measure. Yum.  One thing I don't get about smoothies is why they bother to make them with banana's as once you put banana in it just overpowers everything else. I'll stick with my berry one.
3 Really, Juiced up in Ocean Terminal is just another smoothie/juice place that has sprung up to fill an already saturated market.  I mean, I admit - if I fancy something fruity and actually good for me, this is where I would head. Theres something special about getting all of your five a day in liquid form.  The trouble is, you pay a premium for smoothies etc because they are 'cool', and if you are in Ocean Terminal chances are you have already spent all your money anyway.
4 You can't really go wrong with this place! they have amazing options, really healthy and outline the exact benefits they have to you. Brilliant!!  The staff are really knowledgeable and make it look like the easiest thing in the world to whip up a smoothie!   It's quite cheap and it;s well worth the trek, although there are other branches of this place in the city. If you pass it by, stop and have a smoothie!
