3 The Venetian has a little "food court" type of dining option in the casino.  There are 4-5 small to-go windows, Cafe Santa Lucia being one of them.  I was craving a croissant and found one here.  Although it was $3.95 for ONE croissant.  Jeez!  Croissant was yummy though.
4 After visiting the Imagines Exhibit Gallery, my daughter had this request for tiramisu.  Since I could never say no to her, tiramisu it is.  I didn't originally know where to go so I asked the people at the exhibit and they suggested that we come here.    Let's start with price.  I think you get a combination of Italy's prices, Venetian's prices, and the fact you're in a casino food court on the strip.  This means that everything on the menu cost a little more than you expect.  A 3 x 3 square of tiramisu cost over $5.  My daughter loved it and I had to see what all the hype was about.  I took one bite and it's not bad at all. It's spongy and has that amaretto/coffee taste. One thing I love about tiramisu is that cool and creamy texture once you get to the middle of your bite.  Yes, it's pretty good actually.  Only thing missing was one of their $5 coffee's to compliment it.
1 Date: 06/19/2014  I went Cafe Santa Lucia now d/b/a Caf√© Pan for breakfast in the food court of Venetian...    $6.50 Egg/Cheese Croissant $2.75 Small Coffee $0.75 Tax   I hardly tasted the cheese on my breakfast sandwich.  Only thing I liked is that they served illy coffee.  P.S. I was reviewing my credit card statement and wondered when did I ever make a purchase at Chow Baby!, but then I realized Chow Baby! was the BBQ stand next to the cafe.
