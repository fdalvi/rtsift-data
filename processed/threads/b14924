3 Don't feel like spending $$ on a Costco membership?  Smart & Final is your way to go then if you are interested in food related items.  No membership fee is required, although their prices may be slightly higher than Costco as a result.  They sell restaurant type supplies, bbq supplies, fresh, frozen, and prepackaged foods in bulk.  They also have a wide selection of alcohols in larger sizes, with some good brands for sale (Patron tequila, Mt. Gay rum, etc).
5 5 stars for Sean! He is great eye candy when I shop here. No complaints though... At least not yet.
4 Good prices on many items, but not everything.  I like that you can get boxes of full size candy bars in which it calculates to about. $.51 a bar.  Sometimes they have a deal on whole cases of fruit, like bananas for $0.47 lb instead of the regular price of $0.57 sale price per pound.  And they have tomatoes available like this too.  As a past cake decorating instructor I will also tell you this is the place to get Pastry Pride, non-dairy whipped topping that you use in homemade buttercream icing.   Mmm. Check the ads and compare prices.  Good place to come if you plan to entertain a crowd.
