5 Every time I've been to Jerry's shop I've found the staff to be really friendly and helpful.  This little shop is a hidden gem for those of us who loose many balls in a few rounds of golf.
5 Just received my first order from Jerry's.  I could not be more pleased with the quality of the golf balls I received.  Of the four dozen Taylor Made Pentas, five or six had corporate logos (who cares) and two or three were very slightly discolored.  Otherwise, PRISTINE, not a single one has "path rash" or any other blemish.  I have found the source for my future golf ball purchases.
5 Great place to buy golf balls! Pro v1, Calloway , and Titleist balls have been used but not abused. Cheap
5 This place would be perfect if it were open on Sundays. I dropped by the Phoenix headquarters and there are most definitely deals to be had. A dozen "C" grade Pro V1 golf balls for around 10 bucks. Now, the sign might say "C" grade, but do a little digging around in the bin and you can easily find a dozen balls in excellent condition. I saw no noticeable scratches or blemishes, just the occasional logo or sharpie markings.  Structurally, these balls were in great condition and cleaned off very nicely.   This place has every top-shelf and middle of the road ball you can think of. All are in great condition for a great price.   You'll also find good deals on nice used clubs. The re-gripping service is dirt cheap. But golf balls are bread-and-butter here and this place does it as well as anyone else. Quality is so far above the packaged used golf balls you'll find at target and sporting goods stores.
