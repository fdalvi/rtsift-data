4 There is an older gentleman (Roger) that works there that always seems to be there when I go here. He is always very helpful and friendly. He has inspected my Hayward bottom cleaning device several times over the years. Sometimes he says it looks OK and suggests other potential problems or sometimes he tells me a part needs replacement. He seems to be a straight shooter not out just to sell replacement parts. He definitely knows this device well though. He has not charged me when no part is needed, even if he did a total disassembly to look at all the internal parts and do minor cleaning or lubrication. Leslie's is not the cheapest option but they are conveniently located to me and usually have exactly what I need.
3 The folks at this Leslie's are very nice but they seem to be selling junk lately.  I bought a chlorine dispenser in June and within a few weeks, it wouldn't screw shut anymore and I would have chlorine tablets on the bottom of the pool.  I also bought a leaf skimmer, which came apart in a week or so.  I returned it, they replaced it and it fell apart again.  It's nice that Leslie's is willing to take things back but I don't want to be running back to the pool store all the time.    I bought a new skimmer at the pool shop down the road - NPS, I think.  It's next to the Valero gas station on 90th Street.  Maybe they have the same supplier - I don't know.  But I have to give them a try.
1 Terrible customer service. The store manager Mike has the worst attitude - needs to re-think why he is in business.
5 I drive out of my way just to visit this pool store. They provide great customer service and work on pool cleaners for free. I would definitely recommend this store
