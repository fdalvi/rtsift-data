4 I always have pretty good experiences here.  And I almost always take my car here for service, with the Pep Boys Rewards, it definitely makes it worth it.  I've found the mechanics here to be honest about what service is needed, they don't try to rake you over the coals and get you to do a bunch of unnecessary stuff.  And there are usually good coupons online for whatever you need done that make the prices reasonable.
5 Pep boys is great both in price and service. I bought tires from them about 6 months ago and my left rear tire seemed to go flat over a 3 day period. Set an appt and they found two nails in that tire and two other nails in two more tires. I didn't buy road hazard insurance on them but they fix if they can free of charge. I had them do an o change while I was there and it is normally $100 per change due to 8 qts of oil and synthetic for a Mercedes. The manager said she found some for less and reduced the cost to $65 for me. Also rotated the tires free of charge. They match prices apparently and then take an additional 5% off that according to a phone call I overheard. I'd definitely recommend giving them a try.
5 They did a great job taking care of my car and what I needed. Even went above and beyond to find me an antenna at the dealership.
