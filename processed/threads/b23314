5 My husband and I just selected a diamond ring for me from Better Jewelers and I was so impressed with the way Lara and Kostas treated us.  They understood our budget needs and gave us such a good deal on my ring.  Their personal style is so warm and inviting that I came up with a slogan for Better Jewelers -- "Better than the best...so forget all the rest!'
5 Didn't buy any jewelery, but I did need to get a new battery for my watch. Walked in, and had it repaired within 10 minutes. The jeweler even set it to the correct date and time for me!
5 Only two reviews led me here. I brought in four watches for battery replacement. They serviced while I waited and gave me a discount since I mentioned coming because of the Yelp reviews. See Lara.
1 Lets see, you say your store is open until 6pm your sign is lit up that says open. I show up at 5 for a quick watch adjustment and you say you are closing....way to not want customers. So rude!
5 Great Jewler, I inherited 3 family rings  and he made them look brand new all for a very fair price. I definitely recommend Better Jewlers
5 Came here with 2 broken watches and left 20 minutes later with 2 working watches. Only cost me 10.00 each. Love this place!
