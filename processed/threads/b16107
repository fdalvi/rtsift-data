5 Dr. Noorda is one heckuva dentist. Professional, knowledgeable, friendly -- the whole bit. Staff is wonderful. I'm not a fan of going to the dentist, but Dr. Noorda knows what he's doing, and he does it well. I've been awake and have had IV sedation for multiple visits -- he's good. I'll keep going back.
1 Would not use this dentist again. Came in for a simple cleaning and left with numerous gauges in my gums in worse shape than when I walked in. Asked the receptionist if this is normal and she had no sympathy and got very defensive. When I asked to speak with the doctor, he had the same attitude not willing to take any blame or even apologize. DO NOT TRUST YOUR TEETH TO THESE PEOPLE.
5 Been a patient for years. Always top notch dental service and customer service. Every time you walk in you are welcomed warmly and the facility has a nice calming and relaxing feel to it.
