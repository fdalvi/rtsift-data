3 Called them when my car overheated about 20 miles from my house.  AAA sent these guys.  I have no complaints- although the truck ride home was kinda stinky (but I don't expect much from work trucks) and the driver was SILENT!  Didn't even attempt small talk- just turned up his country station for the 20 minute drive.
5 Rescued my 1962 Skylark Convertible, and took excellent car and concern for it. Rick (the tow truck driver) was great! Glad to find a quick, courteous, tow company....Since I probably will be needed their services quite a bit with this beauty! Thanks Guys!
