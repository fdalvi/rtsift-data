5 Another swingers club. Oy vey! After escaping the skanky and famous Green Door, I did NOT want to go next door to this place next to the gay bar, it looked like another weird unsanitary adult entertainment place, but my adventurous friend was like, oh come on, let's look!  The owner personally gave us a tour. Skanky exterior, gorgeous interior. I don't know how the hell they hose that baby down after a night of orgylicious whatnot, but it's all here, flat screen TVs, handcarved wood furniture, rugs, curtains, nice!  The spa is super clean and contemporary furnishings with pleeeenty of space for voyeurs to sit around their super clean looking jacuzzi. The bathrooms and lockers appeared clean too.  It was pretty dead the night we went, but it was before their soft opening, very very new club, can't wait until it becomes a scene. I was informed that this is a very safe club, no one can touch you or they get booted, no booze allowed, but they sell soft drinks and coffee. I still wouldn't make out at a swingers club, not my style, but I wish them luck and I'll be back to visit and gawk like the nerd I am.
1 This place is closed.  This is the fourth time the same people have opened a "business" in Vegas and closed in a matter of weeks.
