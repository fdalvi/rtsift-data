4 For my money this is the best place in Madison to get a gyro.  The place is a little shady and hasn't been updated since it was built, but you'll get a lot of good food for not a lot of cash and you will get it with a smile and that makes all the difference.  The gyros are essentially the same as Parthenon and, for that matter, 99% of all gyro places.  I go with the gyro dinner, however, which is double the meat and is absolutely glorious in all of its artery clogging goodness.  I've never tried any of their other items, but they have your usual deep fried fare if you are so inclined.  Also, the owner always seems to be there and in a friendly mood as opposed to the dour S.O.B.s downtown.
2 After reading other Yelp reviews, I decided to try Dimitri's, unfortunately. The gyro meat was bland...gyros are not meant to be BLAND! We also tried the so-called spinach pie. Again, it's pretty bland and seems like it came from a grocery store freezer. It isn't actually *bad*...it's just not *good*... so I gave it two stars. There is much better food in Madison.  If you want gyros, go to the Parthenon. If you want spinach pie, go to Med Cafe. If you're on the East side and you're desperate, go to Dimitri's.
