4 The Goelet A.C. Beuf Community Center is located on 35th Ave. & Pinnacle Peak Road. This is an awesome community center with several ammenities including: classrooms, a gym/weightroom, indoor track, and dance/exercise room.   The indoor track is free to walk and is air conditioned - bonus for those walkers who dread the summer heat.  Use of the gym is at a cost - I think around $60 for the year, so it's pretty inexpensive but the gym is pretty small.    They offer a variety of fitness/dance classes, at a cost, including: aerobics, ballet, belly dance, kickboxing, pilates and yoga + many more.  They also offer specialty education classes including: oil painting, computers and spanish.  I have taken a few of the classes and they are pretty inexpensive and last for a few months at a time - either once or twice weekly. It seems that they offer a lot of classes and activities for kids and seniors as well.   Other amenities include indoor basketball court, softball fields, soccer field, basketball and volleyball courts, playgrounds, and picnic areas.    The center is always clean and the staff is incredibly helpful.  If in or close to the neighborhood this is a great community center to have access to.
5 Great rec center! Indoor Basketball, walking track and small work out room! Basically all of the equipment your normal gym has just scaled down.  Very inexpensive for a year! $10 a year rec pass, and $50 to use the work out (weight room).   Site also offers a lot of classes for the kids and for the adults. Yoga, Senior Center, etc.
5 Great place for your kids!
