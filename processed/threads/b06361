5 Another one of my favorite charities, I was first introduced to them a few years ago at their annual 5k event.  I've always heard about the House, but didn't know what they did for the community until I took the tour of the facility.  When kids are seriously ill and need to travel to Las Vegas for healthcare, the House provides a place for them and their families to be together during the crisis.  There's so many things we take for granted when we have money and health insurance, that we don't realize just how lucky we are.  For complete details of what they do at the House, here's the link to their site: http://www.rmhlv.com/story.html  I am impressed with the amount of effort and energy that the volunteers put into helping these needy families.  I met a few of the kids impacted by their efforts and to see the hope and happiness on their face was priceless.  I try not to miss a 5k event.  It's for a great cause and I've met some wonderful people.  Return Factor - 100%
5 Looking for a charity that is 100% true intentions and delivers on all of their promises?  Then you have come to the right place.  I was fortunate to donate to them last year through a client of mine and we are donating again.  After getting to know the staff and learning more about the charity, I was so amazed at the love, support and help that they offer families in need.    And, did you know that even though they carry the name "Ronald McDonald" it is only because of an initial endowment?  Apparently, they do not continue to give money but the charity runs off 100% local donations.  So, if you are looking for a great charity - here it is!
5 This is one of my favorite places to volunteer. They also have a record of being true with 100% of donations and everything going into caring for families of children in hospitals.   They run on 100% of local donations as far as I'm aware of. I love working with the staff and seeing the families and being able to cook for them!
