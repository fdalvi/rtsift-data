4 Great service at the drive-thru.  Could be a bit cleaner on the inside.
5 Paige is an awesome employee! She is able to multi-task always with a smile! How refreshing for fast food!
3 I know... It's horrible that I feed my child these greasy, non-nutritional meals but you know what, there are days that I'm desperate. Call me a bad mom... Go ahead, I dare you!   Anyway, sometimes it needs to be done. In any case, I don't have any problems whenever I come to this one. I go through the drive-thru, pay, pick up my order and roll out. My stuff is always in the bag and I've got a happy kid.
2 Why is it when your Order is wrong they Act surprised like this has never happen before. Do yourself a walk in.
1 They only accept cash? Since when? Food was cold. Its Mc Donald's I guess that's expected? Oh and the cashier can't count. She short changed me. I think I'll call corporate. Worst Mc Donald's ever.
