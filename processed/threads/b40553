5 First time at this store was during the Black Friday madness,  but it wasn't at all.  Maybe I just got there at a better time.    The selection here had more variety versus the PH location and staff was helpful. I didn't even know that this location existed until I passed through it. I think they might have moved from the Mandalay Bay location.
5 Didn't know this store existed until my daughter took me to it the other day. I was surprised by how friendly and helpful the employees were as most stores targeted at teens have rude staff. My daughter found the perfect outfit for her birthday and was helped by many associates along the way. I asked them for their names and some of the ones I remembered in particular were Lissy, Jessica and Jill. I'm sorry if I forgot anyone else. They were very bubbly and all in all it was a great experience. I will definitely allow myself to be dragged back by my teenagers!
5 Urban Outfitters is one of my favorite stores. You can find cool, funny, crazy pop culture items here. They have cute shirts and dresses, scarves, accessories, shoes, books, pants, phone accessories, bags, vinyls and much more. I can easily spend hours in this store which is a rare thing since I hate shopping.   The sales associates here are super chill. I was out on a mission last night for a particular shirt that I couldn't find and they were closing in an hour. One guy came up to me and helped me find my shirt. It was in the back and at the bottom shelf - no wonder I couldn't find it! I got the last one in my size, success!  I don't normally buy books for fun but when I do, they're from here. Cook books, books about beer, sarcasm, Grumpy Cat, shoes, Ryan Gossling, etc.  This is also a great store to buy a gift for your quirky friends. Did I say I love this store?
