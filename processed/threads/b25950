4 Come on the right day and you can get a seriously smoking deal.
1 If there was a way to give negative stars, I would. I have had Identity theft happen through this store. The store claims I bought a washer and dryer and everything, def have not purchased anything. I have copies of the papers they accepted with a supposed family members signature then forged my own signature. WHen I call to get this fixed, there is no urgency or call backs. They don't even trust their employees with sensitive info from people's sale forms. NOT A GOOD BUSINESS!
5 Let me say first I bought my washer/dryer and refrigerator last Friday and I was a bit worried due to the other review. I read other reviews online and I took a chance and let me say I am glad I did. The lady who helped me was very nice and was trying to get me the most for my money. I bought a stainless Kenmore refrigerator and a Kenmore Washer and Dryer. I was able to get my delivery the same day and hook up with hoses for my washer, new waterline for my refrigerator and new dryer tube for $35!!!! Home depot or Lowes couldn't beat that!!! I did have a small issue with the dryer but I called them and they were out the very next morning. I have since sent my friend and relatives to them and they couldn't be happier. This is a great place for the money and services! I will be back for a stove!!
5 Fantastic customer service, friendly staff, and an overall excellent shopping experience. Great price on a Maytag Freezer/Fridge. Even though I didn't mention a Craigslist advertisement, I was still told about the special online pricing and given that price. $35 delivery is a steal and the service was professional and on-time. Highly recommend.
