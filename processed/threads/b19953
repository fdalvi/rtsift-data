3 Considering the amount of occasions I've passed every different branch of Howies in Edinburgh, it's pretty incredible that I only just visited one for dinner very recently. The Alva Street branch of Howies is tucked away downstairs in a basement in the west end, so I got a bit lost looking for it, even with an iPhone equipped with GPRS and a supposedly extensive knowledge of Edinburgh geography.  The restaurant's interior is simple, but attractive and modern, and you do feel very instantly comfortable and relaxed. Howies is a great option if you fancy a meal out with friends, but nothing too fancy or formal, and advantages are that you can bring your own vino, plus the bill is never going to come to anything too outrageous, because the menu prices are fairly inexpensive. My fish main course was absolutely fine, not bad in any way, and decent enough, but it could have done with a wee extra something to give it that additional bit of tastiness. Definitely an option to consider for casual or otherwise city centre dining.
