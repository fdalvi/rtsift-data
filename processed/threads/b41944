5 We had intended to go to another restaurant in the area that we discovered was closed. So, we thought we would try this new place and were pleasantly surprised. I had the corned-beef hash wrap from the breakfast menu and it was delish! It came with a generous side of fruit. My companions had the bleu cheese bacon burger and the roast beef baguette. My only complaint is that they don't have brewed iced tea. Otherwise, we had no problems and would definitely return.
4 Great little spot for a fast weekend breakfast or workday lunch. Very friendly, accommodating and eager to please. And the place is spotless.  The menu situation can be confusing. They seem to have more dishes on offer that you would think -- be sure to ask about specials. I'd recommend a specials board that they can change daily in addition to the chalkboard menu behind the counter.   One little ambience minus: Radio tuned to a Top-40 station is a little intrusive especially when there are commercials. Proprietors should consider hooking up an iPod instead and lowering the volume a little.
