5 If you need your shoes or boots repaired quickly this is your place. I took my favorite pair of riding boots in to have the heels replaces and he called me back the next day, they were ready for pick-up. I have since taken 3 other pairs to have the heels changed to a quieter sole  and got the same excellent customer service.   and he polished and shined each pair, they look like new. I think I will take my special boots in at the end of each season before storing them.  Happy and very satisfied customer!  ST
5 I had my wife's shoes rubber sole repaired and we are happy with the service and value that Recino provided.  We are planning on returning for more work.  He also does tailoring and clothes repairs.  The location of his store we went to was at the NorthEast block of Civic Center blvd and Cheyenne though.  I'm not sure if he's moved recently or opened an additional shop.
5 This guy does fast, quality work with a smile. The location is very convenient too, just off the Cheyenne exit at North Civic Center and he is open 7days per week.  Definitely going back!  I would consider the prices to be average but add the speed and quality you'll get here and you're still way ahead of the game.
