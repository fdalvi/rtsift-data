3 The clerks here are always pretty friendly. I stop here once and a while to pick up a 6 pack after a long day. The prices are decent for a convenience store.
3 Expensive gas, but very friendly cashiers. Even though it may look like a quick stop on your way to the freeway, it probably will set you a few minutes behind. Of course, if you are looking for one of those rare customer service miracles, it is worth the delay. The extra time and few cents (my gas tank is like 15 gallons = $1-$1.50 more to fill than @ Arco) fall under one of the few luxury categories I can justify these days: CUSTOMER SERVICE. They always have what I want and they're nice to me.
3 It's just a gas station, but the clerks are for the most part extremely friendly and it's on the freeway side.
