5 The best customer service in the Valley.  John and Rich really care about their customers and will go out of their way to help.  Can't recommend them enough.
5 I have been in several times to do some mail. Always treated very nicely by the crew. They have earned my business.
5 Whenever I need extra $$$ whether I'm between paychecks, or for speacial events like birthdays, baptismals, graduations etc,. I just visit my friends John and Richard at Mail for You and mission accomplished!. They have the best interest rates in town and the customer service cant be beat!!! Thats why I am a loyal repeat customer as Mail for You has always come to my rescue!!!! 5 star Rating all the way!!!!!!!!
4 I have had a Postal Box here at "Mail For You" for a few years now. Decent priced and it comes in handy! A lot of things I don't like being shipped to my address. Some bills, important documents, or anything work related, ect...
1 They ve sent the money, to a totally different country. Its my fault that i didnt check it, but still, man such a waste of time. Intended to send to chicago Illinois. Instead was sent to Uruguay, weird
