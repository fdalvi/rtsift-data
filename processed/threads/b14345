4 So, I found this bagel place because its in the same shopping strip as my 'new' Fry's grocery store.  I went in, and it was pretty good.  They have a nice variety of fresh bagels, sandwiches, and a nice menu selection of items to choose from.  I went with a bagel, and asked if they had lox cream cheese.  He said that he would make it fresh for me on request!  wooohoo!  I really like this place better then Einstiens, and the guys there seem to be friendly and cool.   Great place to grab a bagel and a coffee on a Saturday or Sunday Morning!  PS.  This is my 100th review!  go me!
2 I'm pretty sure these bagels have never seen boiling water, and to be honest they reminded me of nothing so much as the tragic frozen failbagels of my childhood.  I guess our first warning should have been the exceptionally alarming "CAPPUCCINO" poster in the window, showing what appeared to be (coffee?) chocolate milkshakes with whipped cream and chocolate. :(  Two stars because it was, technically, an edible bagel, though my husband and I only managed to each finish half of ours.
4 I had a good whole wheat bagel warm and yummy with good best Seattle's coffee!! really good combination and good service. Not a fan of having bagels every day but this place is nice for once in a while. They let you chose what you want and not rush you into buy whatever.
3 This economy sucks.  A perfectly respectable Bagel Shop bit the dust.  I would have liked to have come in here, especially after finding the Rincon Restaurant closed next door.  Darn!
