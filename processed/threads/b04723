5 The people that work at this Autozone are awesome! I needed a headlight for my Honda and I wasn't sure if it was going to be difficult to replace. The manager replaced it himself for me. I truly appreciated the help. I have been to this location a couple times and they are not pushy and don't sell you stuff you don't need! I highly recommend this Autozone.
5 Great service, took the time to check my car battery and inform that it could be recharged, unlike O'Riellys who wanted to sell me a $120 battery
1 I wast old my part wasnt the problem when it was.and from coworker to coworker they kept speaking under their breath as if i was stupid and didnt know anything.basicaly they thought i didnt know anything and tried to diagnose my problem.your just parts person not the mechanic theres definatly two diferences there.they lost a customer i will never come back because of that.
4 I went in with issues on my 98 Jeep Cherokee and I was helped out immediately. Although we didn't find an immediate answer they worked with me for a good amount of time and got the answer in the end. All in all pretty happy with the customer service and knowledge at this store.
