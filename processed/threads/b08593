5 I adore Steve Madden shoes.  The staff here are always polite, helpful, and fun.  I was able to return a pair of shoes i bought there even though i lost the receipt.
1 Never GO HERE. EVER. First they robbed me of 150 dollars for a straight year until one day I decided to call after finding the receipt of the shoes I returned in an old bag. even after everything, my "check" got lost in the mail .. and never got sent. So I had to go out of my way to pick up my money that was suppose to be returned to me one year ago.
5 Store is pretty small. Could be bigger because i'm sure it gets super crowded on the weekends. No a huge selection of shoes but it's a pretty good selection. The sale was a good idea though how you scratch the number off the card. Employees were nice. Store is pretty hidden though which sucks since it is a nicer brand.
