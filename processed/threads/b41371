5 I went to pt for my knee pain. I've been working with Mark for the past 6 or 7 weeks.  My knees are so much better.  When I come in we spend the time on him deeply working the area and electric stimulation. He expects me to do my exercises at home and  I don't waste time at  my appointment doing these.  He is very knowledgable and pleasant to work with. I feel like we are a team working   towards healthier knees! By far the best PT  Experience I've ever had. I highly recommend Landmark Physical Therapy!
5 In 5 minutes Mark, the owner, fixed a problem I have had with my knee for 3 months! He has extensive knowledge of the functions and systems of the human body. His understanding of human anatomy and his ability to translate and teach it to his patients is remarkable.
5 I have previously had PT for a persistent rotator cuff problem. Nothing ever helped me until Mark, owner of Landmark, treated me.  His hands on treatments, combined with his customized exercise program, cured my shoulder problem in 12 sessions.  In addition, He taught me so much about the anatomy and physiology that I understand why consistent strengthening exercises are so important in maintaining the good results. Mark is not only a remarkable physical therapist but a remarkable teacher as we'll.
