3 The movie selection is pretty good and the service is always prompt and friendly. In fact, had I not needed to visit the bathroom with my young daughter today I would have gladly given this a 4 or 5 star rating. But the bathroom was absolutely disgusting. Just completely gross and filthy.
4 Pretty good movie and game selection. The service is always very good and the employees are always happy.
4 So...normally I don't rent DVDs and this was not the reason I went to Blockbuster. Earlier in the day I was speaking with a friend who said she had gone there as they were having a sale. Previously viewed DVDs 5/$20. Really? Wow. And they had a great selection. I am more of a chick flick fan but they had boy movies as well. They also had movies for $1.99 without the case. Sometimes it is nice to have some DVDs for travel or just to have in your back pocket for a rainy day. The staff was so friendly and helpful. What a great find! Thanks Sara:)
