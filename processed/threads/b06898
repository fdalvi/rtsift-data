1 What kind of "mall" closes at 5pm on a Saturday night?! This crappy mall, apparently.  Ugh. Poor selection of stores, rundown appearance, and ridiculous hours = FAIL.
2 Westgate has an interesting selection of shops, but its never had much of any sort of vibe. Since the movie theatre closed a number of years back, it's really slowed the pace of the whole building.
1 I found it ironic that there was a store called "Relics - Fossils and Rocks" in here.  That's essentially what this place is.  Sadly, it's gone the way of the Grand Ave. Mall in Milwaukee, with no large scale stores other than TJ Maxx (which is actually pretty decent), and only one other real draw in the Wisconsin Sportswear for WI team apparel.  It's too bad, as this place isn't that far from a few decent restaurants and stand alone stores.  Maybe they can lease it out for a zombie movie?
