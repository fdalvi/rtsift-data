5 I absolutely LOVE Mai Thai! I live just around the corner from here and I always kick myself when I walk past because I never think to come here. It is located just off Fisherman's Close, which, upon my first visit, sortof scared me, but it's completely safe and I quite like the location. From the outside it looks really clean and tidy and the inside is surprisingly chic too!  The menu is to die for, there's no other way of putting it. I would be happy eating here for the rest of my life, working my way through the menu. The scallop and aubergine salad in particular is delicious, and their mixed starter to share is huge! My mum and I couldn't finish it. The staff are lovely too, and they have free Wifi!   Furthermore, they have a really good vegeterian menu too. Normally they only have one or two options, but they have an entire menu dedicated to meat-free options!  A normal 3-course meal for two (with wine) costs around Â£65, which I think is pretty good!  I can't recommend this place highly enough.
