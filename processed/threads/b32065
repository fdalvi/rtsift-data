5 This guy's good.  I've worked with him on several occasions, and his level of professionalism is second to none.  Attention to detail, understanding the flow of the event and needs of his clients, and his creativity is awesome.  Easy to work with, and he only stops when you're satisfied.    Highly Recommended!
5 Our friends highly recommended Scott for our family photos this year as we finally were fed up with studio experiences and photos, and I'm so glad  they did.  We were able to take our photos on the day we wanted, at the place we wanted, and Scott made the experience great.  He has a great attention to detail, is very easy to work with, takes REALLY good photos and is absolutely professional.  We used some of the photos for our holiday card and have gotten numerous compliments on the photos.  We will be using him for all of our photos from now on!
5 I will Start out by saying Scott is a great photographer, I used his services for my daughters bat-mitzvah and also her modeling photo shoot. He is extremely professional, detailed, easy to work with and most of all takes FABULOUS pictures. I would recommend him highly to anyone who wants to capture their extraordinary moments.
