1 I tried to go here twice now to eat and they have been closed both times.  Once I went on a Friday night at 6 p.m. and they were closed.  WTF?!  There are no hours on the doors and you can never tell when someone is working or not.  I will never give this place, Two Hippies or Long Wongs my business anymore considering their food has gone downhill and not to mention the way they handle business.  They're only getting 1 star because there wasn't an option to give 0 stars.  Save your time and go to Hamburger Works, Lenny's or Lucky Boy.  What a joke!
4 Went there this weekend with a bunch of friends and we had a blast!  All the food was very good including the fries and they were not Ore-Ida crinkle cut but perfectly salted homemade fries! The owners were friendly and there is so much to see on the walls, we could have been there all day.  Wish it was cooler to sit out on the cute deck, maybe in a month or so! We will be back!
1 This place is always closed!  I live in the neighborhood and support local business but cant do it any more.  Ive had lunch twice and both times were dissappointing.  The tacos were on stale tortilla with a very small portion of meat.  The burger and fries were bland.   When it was Two Hippies I was there 5 times a week. I have discovered Lucky Boy right up the street!  Awesome burgers and onion rings!  Americas Tacos rocks on 7th Street!
2 Nothing fat about my burger.... In fact a quarter pounder down the street is bigger..... and maybe fresher as its obviously a frozen patty just like mcd's... The service was good and that's the only reason they get 2 stars....
3 Please DO NOT associate ALL Two Hippies together, they are independently owned and operated. Apparently not all hippies are created equally!!   I frequent the Two Hippies at 43rd Ave and Bethany Home... awesome hand-tossed pizzas, yummy hot wings, and hand-made burgers at a great price.  Mmmmmm good!
