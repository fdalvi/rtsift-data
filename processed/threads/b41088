5 Amazing place with a house full of amazing artists! Thanks for all of the great work so far!
5 Jack has done my last two pieces & they've turned out awesome.  This is a great place with great artists & piercers. Follow them on Facebook & check out their art & piercing selection.  I highly recommend Eldritch Bros.
5 I have followed Jack from shop to shop. It's awesome that he has his own place now. Jack is professional, ethical, and an artist. I've gotten three tattoos from Jack, and they're all terrific. Don't just grab an image from Pinterest and come in and say "do that." Come with an idea, talk it through with him, and let him bring his artistic vision to it. You'll get a great tattoo that is uniquely yours.
