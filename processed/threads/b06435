5 Today was my first time here. The place is a older but quaint place. We were greeted right away and after 5 minutes we were ushered into a room. The doctor came in right away....which was surprising, because we generally have to wait 10-15 minutes at other places. The doctor came in and we immediately started discussing what was going on. I felt that the doctor actually listened to our concerns and instead of just jumping to a conclusion/treatment right away, there will be tests done. We have a follow up appointment next week and until then hopefully the dog gets better.
5 The doctor called and he told us to stop by and pick up wipes for our pug for FREE! Pugs have lots of folds and sometimes they get infected, so it was nice that the Vet called us to give us a big sample of wipes for his wrinkles. Definitely 5 star treatment here!
5 they took real good care of our Lucy cat...and were very professional and honest.  very small location, so don't be fooled or put off by the front.
5 The clinic staff is wonderful, very seldom have I waited past my appt time, and the doctors obviously live their clients.  The clinic is clean, and they have informative posters that are actually interesting.  The doctors always give me several treatment choices, understanding that sometimes, sadly, cost IS a factor.  Easy to get to, next to a Dominoes, so if I need comfort food it's handy! Lol
