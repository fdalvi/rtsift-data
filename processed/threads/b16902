4 Usual bank business, not as busy since it's in "Southern Islands" ha haa
4 Easy review, very simple. Tough to say a whole lot about a simple deposit at a non-peak time. They always seem to be efficient when I come in. Walked to the counter, started filling out my slip, walked straight to the teller window and she knocked out my transaction in about a minute, with some cash back. About 16-18 months ago (in my guess) they put up the glass (bulletproof I again guess) in between the customers and the tellers. Seems very secure to me, the glass in my estimation is about an inch thick, so all you would be robbers, beware!!! haha :)  Side note: Appears $$$ Mayweather banks here too, he rolled up as I was walking out with a backpack full of what I can only imagine would be rolls of cash. His driver was standing next to his Maybach ($500K) and then an identical car rolled up which I can imagine is his matching second car, just in case something happened with the aforementioned backpack. Crazy how much money people have. He needs to fight Pacquiao soon so he can buy another couple cars and flaunt his riches to us commoners. 4 stars, solid bank in my opinion
5 Elaine Wynn banks here. Floyd Mayweather banks here. George Maloof banks here. Welcome to a bank in Southern Highlands I suppose... All that aside, this is by far the best Bank of America out there. The tellers are all wonderful, kind, and helpful. The space is beautiful- new, clean, and they have a lounge. This BofA is awesome!
