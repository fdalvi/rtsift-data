5 This review is really for Dr. Kathleen Kuhlman, M.D.  at Valley Perinatal. After the tech performed the ultrasound, we were concerned because the images were not that great and still had concerns. Due to an abnormality on previous films.,Dr. Kuhlman personally came in and did the ultrasound herself. She was very thorough and explained each image and its significance. She also elaborated about medication conditions related to our baby. She relieved our concerns due to her intelligence, compassion and ability to discuss communicate technical issues well. We only regret not seeing her sooner. I would highly recommend Dr. Kuhlman and wait to make certain that I was seen by her on each visit.
5 WONDERFUL place to go for pelvic and transvaginal ultrasounds! No need to drink the 32 ounces of water other places ask you to drink. They said no need for water. Doctors are trained well in looking for what they need to look for without the need for a full bladder. I wouldn't go anywhere else! Only thing is they changed their name to VALLEY PERINATAL SERVICES.
5 I had a great experience, i tried to call ti set up an appointment with no luck, i sent msg on their website and Facebook they replied within minutes, and I receive a phone call from them, Wendy was very attentive and helpful :) I scheduled my visit for NT Scan Monday at 8am, I got early to fill paperwork , everything went smoothly I didn't get the Sonographer name but she also made me feel comfortable and she really tried her best to get good pictures of my little one, even my baby girl was not very cooperative :) I really appreciate that. Dr. Kuhlman is a very kind and lovely Dr. She is patient and you can interact with her about all your concerns, I felt she really has vocation. You can not go wrong visiting here :)
