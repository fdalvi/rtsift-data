3 I was on my way into Sweet Republic just before Christmas when I spotted Painted Pretzel a few doors down.  Since I love pretzels, I was imagining all sorts of delights.  Hard pretzels in knots, twists, and rods covered with the finest chocolate.  Freshly baked soft pretzels salted, or rolled in cinnamon and sugar, or butter and garlic.  You name it.  They were going to sell it.  Well I was sorely disappointed.  Upon entering, I realized this is probably more of a mail order type business.  No soft pretzels, either.  They specialize in pretzels dipped in chocolate and topped with nuts, candy pieces, etc.  There were some boxes of pretzels already made up, and we purchased a few.  The honey wheat pretzel rods were actually pretty good, the small bite-sized pretzels were nothing special.  The chocolate was a nice quality, but not the best.    Although they hand dip all the pretzels, they do not make the actual pretzels.  So if you're on a local foods kick, which I'm not, this isn't the place for you.  Not bad to have around the house and for gifts to pretzel lovers or corporate gifts as they are better than the products you would find in most grocery stores.  I was just hoping for a little more.
5 Get ready to get addicted! I tried their peanut butter babies and they were amazing. I have them at my office and I find that after a few I have to hide them in my desk drawer so I don't just eat the whole batch ;)
5 Absolutely delicious!
2 As far as quality was concerned the pretzels are nothing special. The quality is the chocolate is okay but far from the best and too sweet for my taste. The price point of the erectile is also quite high in terms of value for money. Additionally the cost to ship the retzels is more expensive than comparable products.
