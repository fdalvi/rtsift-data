5 I'm willing to travel because they have never messed up my hair, are very precise, and spend the time to do it right every time. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are 10 dollar haircut days and I always make my monthly trip to Metro on those days to save a few bucks. There is no better deal when it comes to quality cuts valley wide. The staff is always professional and they know what to ask you instead of just doing the same cut every time cough greatclips cough. I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes and my experience has always been worth the wait/ trip. They use a straight razor to finish off your cut which keeps you clean longer. I would highly recommend this barber shop to all of my Yelp friends.  Bring cash, if you want to skip the 95 cent charge card fee
5 My hair was messed up from v's barbershop came here hoping that they could fix it up and they did an awesome job Sam is highly recommended and they can do all types of cuts cheap haircut to 15 bucks and they do it right the first time.
