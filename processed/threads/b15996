5 I highly recommend action tree service. Excellent service, most business send their workers to do the job rarely does the owner come to every job and speaks with the client face to face. Maynard gave me a great price and had few funny stories to tell. Looking forward to continuing my business with him.
5 Action Tree Service removed two palm trees for me. Not only was his pricing very fair but his crew did a great job. We had a broken roof tile and Maynard not only repaired it at no extra cost he also took time to find a tile that would be an excellent color match.  Maynard is very knowledgeable about Palm  trees. I highly recommend him.
1 I called at 3:15 PM. The man who answered sounded a bit put off that I had called. Like I was a waste of his time. Ok so what some people just sound that way. I wanted an estimate to trim some palm trees in my yard. He told me he would come over later in the afternoon. No definite time but I figured it wouldn't take him too long to come over.  At 7:15 I stopped waiting. He never showed up. I guess he doesn't want my money. That's ok there are other companies in town that I'm sure will want my business.
