4 This coffee shop is located in the Mesa Riverview shopping district close to Bass Pro Shops.  It is a family owned coffee shop that has coffee, tea, and all the goodies that a coffee shop should have.  Plus, most importantly, they have free wireless internet!  They have wonderful hours, for your internet and coffee pleasures!  The only thing that held me back on giving them 5 stars is the seating.  They have tables and such, but the only comfortable seating is a set of couches.  The rest are square tables.  I do not find them to be comfortable in regards to kicking back, relaxing and condusive to extensive internet surfing.  Makes me feel like I am surfing the net at my kitchen table.  Otherwise, this is a great little location thats a non starbucks type coffee shop.  Wonderfully decorated with local artists artwork, clean, neat, close parking, and the service so far has been good.
