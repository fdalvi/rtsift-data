5 Okay this place is fuckn awesome. Initially I just started coming in because I thought the manager was hot and I wanted to stare at him more then I started lingering a bit more not to the extent of a bad fart but more like the smell of fried chicken that makes you want more. Anyways I started hanging there more and all the dudes (and one chick) are cool as shit. Really open people. I've never  seem them once give poor service to anyone even customers who give attitude. They keep it professional and personable. Just try it out. This place is pretty dope.
5 I absolutely adore this place. I have been in here enough times to earn a free smoothie with my frequent buyers card, and every time I have come here, the staff has been amazing. To top that off, the store is always well stocked and clean. I have yet to purchase any merchandise here, but I really love their smoothies. They have lots of fresh ingredients and will customize anything for you, if you just explain what you are looking for (i.e., meal replacement, protein, pre- or post- workout, low calorie, low sugar, fancy add-ins, etc.).  I come here anytime I am looking to add some protein to my diet, or for a meal replacement when I am on the go. LOVE THIS PLACE! :D
4 First visit was awesome! Whomever was working was extremely friendly, helpful & knowledgeable. He bade me a sugar free lie carb peanut butter chocolate shake. If this place was slightly closer to my home it would be dangerous! Can't wait to go back.
2 Might not go back. My first visit was great I was helped out by a very friendly blonde girl. My second and third visit (which was today) were terrible. I had the same guy made my shake both visits, I ordered the stack and got just a regular banana protein shake, no other supplements were added, the guy is really rude and careless. Might try to go back but if he's at the counter I will be walking right out.
