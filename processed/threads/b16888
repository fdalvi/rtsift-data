5 I recently bought my first motorcycle and brought it to the guys at O'School Choppers. They took their time in explaining in simple man terms what they're fixing and how each part works with another. They had my bike in and out and I left feeling glad I took it there. These guys rock!
5 Great service and explanation of issues. A set of plugs rather than a rebuild suggested by (RRHD) than a cross country trip. No egos - just people who like bike's and riders.
