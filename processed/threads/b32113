5 I LOVE this Jazzercise with a passion! Jeri is AMAZING and really has a way to make all her Jazzercisers feel comfortable. I am new to Fountain Hills and went to a class for the first time. I LOVED IT!!! Such a great workout...and not boring (like at the gym) Jeri keeps the energy high and makes the classes VERY enjoyable! Time went by SO fast! I absolutely LOVE IT!!! Cant wait for my next class! :-)
5 Jeri's jazzercise class is awesome! While visiting a friend in Fountain Hills from NYC  I was brought to this class. The class, music and workout were great. Jeri's energy keeps you moving while getting a great calorie burning workout in. As a local NYer with endless gym options I was impressed and wish we had something like this back home.  Taking this class is a MUST if you're in the Fountain Hills area!
5 I love Jeri H.  She is the best.  The instructors of this jazzercise are awesome.  Jeri makes everything seem easy and fun.  As a snowbird, I look forward to coming down to the valley and joining jazzercise for the time I am here.  I love the people & the instructors Jeri & Jan are terrific.  I haven't met our newest instructor Liz because I usually go at 8 am and start my mornings off with a really good wake up!  Everything is high energy & fun.  Even if you can't get the move, you do eventually & if you fake until you make it, that is okay by Jeri.  Jazzercise is big down here in AZ, but back home it is Zumba and although it looks like fun, I cannot do it as I have some issues that prevent it.  There are Jazzercise classes, just a long distance away & sporadic.  I love that Jeri has a class everyday & several a day if you need & even on the weekend.  It is awesome & although we go home soon, when we come back down, one of my first stops is Jazzercise of Fountain Hills & Jeri's class!!!
5 My mom did this program for about a year and she lost SO much weight! It motivated her in her life and I could see progress in her sense of being as well as progress in her weight control. She loved the jazzercize classes and I can honestly say I was impressed with her progress!
