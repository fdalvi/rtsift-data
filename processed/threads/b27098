5 The staff is very helpful and friendly. Very close to home and much easier than going to the post office. They can pretty much handle everything here.
5 Mike at this Postal Pros in Summerlin is the absolute best! Wow! He goes out of his way to take care of the customers. Please make it a point to be nice to him. He works hard and I really wonder how many times he is thanked for his attention to detail, his customer centricity and his overall pleasant demeanor. I don't even need a Postal Pros mailbox anymore and renewed anyway for another 6 months -- why? because every time I go in, I see Mike's smiling face and pleasant "hi Laci" - yes, he calls me by name! That service is worth way more than 6 months fees of the use of the mailbox.  You are a hero Mike! Thanks for all you do.  Laci L. Summerlin
5 I highly recommend Postal Pros!  I prefer to support small, family-owned businesses with great customer service.  They are always helpful and friendly, and they take care do things well and right.  I will definitely keep using Postal Pros for all my shipping and printing needs.  Thanks, guys!
1 Went here today to mail my xmas cards. And guess what they are trying to charge me 3.00$ per card and they are all for Las Vegas mails... They said because I wrote the address the other way it is a considered a package and not a regular mail... Really?? Ok I'm not stupid...for 19 cards my total would be 58$ ... 10x more expensive than my 3.99$ 20 pcs cards... Postal pros.. U guys can cheat better than that!!! Went to UPS, mailed all my cards for 12$...will never ever ever go back here and pls be smart next time it's not worth the trip!!
1 WOWWWW run don't walk I have been billed incorrectly three times the front desk kid is a disaster and condescending  . The owner is never around he will not return calls and the other postal pros is now separated from them due to the issues. Lost packages .Short lines maybe but ask yourself why their is no line. I would try to call the owners if you have a problem which I would guess is a high probability! Sam Gianos owner  andrew shields aka Lorn Owner
5 Friendly service and great staff. It didn't take long for the people at postal pros to recognize me on sight. Often bringing out packages before I had opened my box. It's wonderful to feel like part of a community.   The selection of greeting cards and gift wrapping rivals many specialty shops. The little extras are priced reasonably and help to finish a package.   The location and adjoining stores making this an ideal spot to easily complete the "to-do" list.
