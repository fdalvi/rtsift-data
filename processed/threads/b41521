5 Best boba tea in Arizona!!! Taiwanese food A+++  my personal favorite: loyal milk tea with boba   Best milk tea
5 The fact they have pudding as an option besides tapioca gets 5 stars from me.  You are probably wondering why would I give a business 5 stars for pudding???  If you are from the bay area you and enjoy pudding as an option for your drink besides tapioca and have lived out here long enough to know the struggle of not finding one decent tapioca having cafe that has pudding.  Until Now!!!!   That only took 5 years for Arizona to catch up to California's status.   Thank you jesus for this place I can live a little easier now until we move back!
5 This place has the best boba tea around hands down!  Friendly, quick staff.  I always get the Thai tea w/ boba and it hits the spot! Just make sure if you bring cash you bring bills smaller than 20's =)
5 Great place to relax. The staff is very friendly and the milk teas are fantastic. This shop is adorable.
5 One of the best places for Boba in the area. Not only do they have boba but they have pudding milk tea!  Boba was cooked perfectly and the pudding was delicious. The milk tea that I had there was delicious and the boba was soaked in honey and brown sugar I believe.   The place used to be Lollicup but I think they got a lot better after switching and losing the franchise.  If you're looking for great tasting boba milk tea or even better, pudding milk tea, the Yes Cafe is hard to beat in the area.
