1 Scam. For profit, non accredited scam school. You are better off spending $90.000.00 on mega bucks.
1 Absolutely clueless. I sent them a request for info based on content listed on their website. I get a recruiter calling me today with an attitude, who tells me what's on the website is wrong and they don't offer the program I want anymore. At that point he just hangs up. Dude, you missed an opportunity here to sign someone up as I had other interests besides the one you called about.   One Star, and even that's being given under protest.
1 It's for profit University that only graduates 25% UNLV is at 40% Nothing about this place says it anything more scam to line some else pockets.
1 0 stars! I *almost* signed up for this scam school when I first moved to the area. So thankful I didn't.  Unfortunately, at the time, I didn't understand it was one of those for profit type of "schools". I briefly looked into it and submitted my email to receive more info....instead, a recruiter called me immediately and she was eager to meet with me asap (of course! I'm sure they get some kind of commission since they're basically selling you your program.) I ended up stopping by that day and after speaking with staff, I realized that this was not the route to go!  They put down every other school in the area, and insist that IADT's fees are "cheaper" in the end! HAHA! Really, because I'm pretty sure I'm not paying 75,000 for my education at UNLV... I feel so, so terrible for all the students who put sooo much money into this, thinking they're getting a respectable education. Its sad.  Avoid this place and other schools like it:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_for-profit_universities_and_colleges
