1 The Worst Haircut I Have Ever Grieved Over Was Here!  What is it about cheap or inexpensive?  Does that mean they are all rejects from the Hair Cut Academy or what?....I think I could have cut my hair better if I could have stood behind myself and had sheers.  I guess in this case, I got what I paid for...The haircut was a disaster, even when I explained to the woman to just cut a 1/4 inch off everywhere for shape, she cut the hair down to 1/4 inch from my scalp!!!!!$#@@!##@!#@  I was soooo P*SSED!    But I learned a valuable lesson!----The difference between a good haircut and a bad haircut is about three to four weeks growth time!  There was one good thing though!---LEAVING!
4 I like this location, especially Vicky. She is friendly, listens to what I want and I always leave satisfied.
4 When one kid wanted a short and spiky haircut and the other wants to keep it longer like Justin Bieber, I realized that going to my regular barber might not be the best move, so we checked out Supercuts. Even walking in without an appointment they were able to get both boys in the chairs within 10 minutes and we were out of there in half an hour. Both of the boys came out looking great and they were both very happy with the haircuts they received. I would definitely recommend this location, especially if you have kids who need haircuts.
