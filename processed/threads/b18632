1 Ordered the steak sandwich.  The only thing more horrible would've been drinking the bath water of the person who made it.
4 i beg to differ brent..... my steak salad was muy delicioso..... in fact, you liked my salad so much you ate mine while i drank my bloody mary....
1 I figured after a Vegas hangover, anything greasy would taste great, but I beg to differ with the Prickly Pear Cafe... I can't agree more with Brent N. and I think the only reason why Aron W. gave it a (questionable) 4 star rating is because he was too busy chatting it up with a older mommy named maRRRia... damn, I could never roll my r's.  If you need to throw up all the alcohol before the flight, then please eat here... otherwise move the hell on!
2 I swear this place had better food last year.  I swear I ordered the same salad this year (chicken avocado) and it was horrible while last year it was delicious.  I am not sure what happened but I was disappointed on my most recent visit.  The salad was just bland, the chicken flavorless, the toppings weak and the dressing watery.  The avocado, however, was very good.  I found the staff to be friendly and I like that all the drinks are served in plastic cups so you can take them with you.  In the future, I might return here but only for drinks and not for food.
3 my good friend beasus jeazus has informed me that it has closed and is now a cpk. weak. but  ohhh how i love cpk.... hey and young, screw u! i see that review down there!
