1 Just had dinner from here (delivery) and I couldn't be less impressed if I tried...   Decided to try it out as it had decent reviews on just-eat, tho upon closer inspection a lot of the 6 star reviews seemed to be duplicates and one girl named "Fiona" couldn't be more stoked about the place... think if she is real, she needs her tastebuds checked...  The "shredded beef" is less beef and more dried, deep fried.. something... blurgh.. The "lemon chicken" was BRIGHT ORANGE.. ummm... yea.... I've not come across an orange lemon before, have you?? And for the fact that it looked like it was cooked in fanta, tasted like nothing at all...  The "shrimp with cashews" were frozen shrimps and also didn't have much flavour...  The ribs, for the amount of sauce they were drowning in, had absolutely no taste either...  The mini shrimp in the fried rice were again of the frozen variety and were fairly unpleasant..   Should really have stuck with tried and true than tried somewhere new on this occasion.  Avoid!!
