1 I would not recommend this company to anyone. Terrible customer service, broken air conditioner on a 106 degree night. Driver was half hour late. Supervisor offered to switch bus for us, never did. The complimentary ice and water, not there.There are so many more party bus rentals in Las Vegas that we have used that blow this one away.
1 Stay away from this company.  We first agreed on $125/hr.  He arrived late because he said he pick us up at the wrong hotel.  When he arrived then I asked him to go pickup the dancer.  He said you cannot have a dancer on the bus.  So he charged extra $250 Just to have a dancer.  He just making excuses that you cannot have dancer there.  Do I ended up paying double for what our contract was worth.  He just making excuses that he only drop us at the strip club.  I did not asked to drop us off there.  I told him to drop us off at the hotel.  So be aware of this company.  They are a husband and wife running this business.
1 Horrible company!!  DO NOT BOOK!  They were upset with the simplest questions, the man then told me he didn't care or need my business.  He was cursing and claimed that he would put my phone on their block list so I wouldn't call back for my refund!
