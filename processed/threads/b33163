4 Newly opened in Haymarket Terrace, Pippin offers sweet gifts, little treats and quirky things that you want to take home rather than give to friends!  The shop is relatively small, but still full of lovely things to ogle, touch, and drool over.  With a selection of jewellry (I think most of it is locally crafted), beautiful china, scented candles, ornate and quirky clocks, lovely - lovely! - wrapping papers, and a range of other very sweet and/or stylish Desirable Things!  The service was also very good - polite but friendly, informative and helpful.  I'm not sure if she was the owner or a staff member but she told me about the Christmas event on 1st December, with all of the shops along Haymarket Terrace getting involved, and offered to gift wrap my purchases.    And if she's going to mulled wine and mince pies, I think a little visit to finish off that Christmas shopping will be how I'm spending Thursday evening!
4 Cute wee gift shop at Haymarket.  I had passed it a few times commuting to work and took the chance to pop in on my way home.  Nicely laid out inside and lots of quirky things everywhere you looked.  A little pricey but good quality stuff.    I took the chance to grab a bargain looking through all their birthday cards that were reduced in price.  I always have a couple of spare cards in the house and tend to stock up on them when I get a chance like this.  10 cards bought that were £2.50- £3.25 each now half price.    Nice shop, will need to keep it in mind for little birthday gifts.
5 Great little place full of interesting gift ideas. The staff are really quick to suggest great ideas too!!!
2 Love the stock but the staffs attitudes are poor. This hasn't stopped me from returning though!
