5 This place is awesome! If you like mexican arts/decor you have to check this place out. The store is jam packed with tons of items....crosses, planters, chimineas, leather goods, day of the dead stuff, talavera items, gorditas and much, much, much more. I shop this store frequently even bring out-of-towners here. My aunt sometimes makes trips from central california just to shop here. Check it out.
5 Hands down one of the best Mexican import store in the valley. In fact, I was rather surprised there weren't any Yelp reviews.  Located at 24th/Van Buren, this store has an obscene amount of Mexican crafts, pottery, leather goods, etc. - lots of stuff to feast your eyes on inside! Pottery is on their back patio in addition to their many rooms inside.  Friendly and helpful associates - such a great experience!!
5 Wow ... They have a little of everything.   Great selection of imported items from the traditional ceramic pieces to extensive Day of the Dead items,   Lots of great metal work items for your patio or wall.  This is the place to take out of town guests to find those unique imported items
