1 Probably the worst pizza I've had delivered to my house. Ever. I ordered a £16.99 pizza but thankfully had a voucher so it only cost £9.99 - Thank God as it wasn't even worth that.  The base was uncooked and the amount of toppings was laughable. I've seen more topping on a bog standard supermarket pizza. I also asked for three dips, a simple request which they also managed to get wrong.  I had to fire up my oven and cook it properly which kind of defeated the whole purpose of a take away.     Not good enough.
