4 First off, I have never had any problems here with delays or "jacked" up orders. I usually come by here late nights for a munchies run.   The staff has always been friendly to me, the service fast compared to some "fast" food places I have been, and the food always good for what it is.  As to another review here I always get butt-loads of condiments where i actually have a little horde of sweet n sour sauce's banked up in my fridge lol.
2 I love Jack in the Box, but this location is pretty spotty on service and food quality.  I've eaten at at least a dozen Las Vegas locations and often order the new breakfast sandwich which has waffles for rolls and it is awesome.  At my last visit to this location they served it on tasted really hard crusty waffles instead of the usual moist soft waffles.  It was almost like they toasted them.
3 "Two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun."  Has a nice ring to it, right?    Too bad that is for McDonalds Big Mac and not Jack In The Box's Bonus Jack.  The Bonus Jack just falls short, in my opinion.  I'm not sure if there were onions on it or not.  Shredded lettuce for sure.  But what looked like possible onions may have been,  in fact, tiny bits of lettuce.  And there was no sesame seed bun.  The sauce is different too.  More red than the secret sauce on the Big Mac and a bit sweeter.  The burgers are very similar to each other.  Call me a traditionalist but I prefer the Big Mac hands down.  From the onions to the sauce, the Big Mac is a superior classic.
1 Waited for about ten minutes to have my order taken and everyone in the back obviously saw me but didn't chose the acknowledge me. After waiting for that long I just decided to leave and they didn't even say anything nor apologize for the wait. Terrible customer service
