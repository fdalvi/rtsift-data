4 I've been going to McAuley Pediatrics for close to 9 years now. Both of my children like Dr. Collins as well as Dr. Gonzales. The office staff is friendly and will find ways to work you in if need be.   As a plus they're located right next to an evening only pediatric urgent care so if you can't make it during the day you can go right next door at night.
5 I have been going to MCauley Pediatrics since my oldest son was born, when they were in the office building in the Saint Joseph's Hospital. Dr. Gonzalez has been our main pediatrician, and has ALWAYS been very sensitive to our situation, and our kids health history. She's always been extremely helpful, always looking to get our kids the best and most affordable treatments they've needed. The staff as well has always been very helpful, and have always been able to squeeze us in when we have had an emergency. They've always been able to see our kids on the same day when they've developed a bad infection, and even though sometimes we had to wait some time, it's always been worth it, our kids feel very at ease when going to the Doctor's office.
