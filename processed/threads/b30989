5 Another stop on our day of Antique shopping, we stopped by this store.  This was the first time we've been to this store.  We came here with a few friends who was showing us around.  The store is well organized and most importantly, well lit.  There's nothing more annoying than darkly lit antique stores....it makes it difficult to see the product and get a good gauge of what you're buying if it's not well lit.  The Better Half and I didn't find anything on our wish list, but we had a lot of fun browsing the dealers' booths.  Our friend found an old magazine that featured a photo shoot of Phoenix from the 1960's.....he opened the magazine and showed us some old parts of downtown that were no longer there.  Since he's been around since then, he was able to walk down memory lane with every picture.....isn't that what antique shopping is all about?  Return Factor - 100%
5 My boyfriend and I have been going here for a while, and just love it. In November, he even got my engagement ring here. They brought in a diamond expert to help him choose the best one since i wanted something old. They told him was what in good shape, what he should avoid. Still  my fav place is phx! They have everything from REALLY expensive, amazing furniture, to small and affordable trinkets.
4 I you like glass, jewelry this may be your place.   They also had a lot of silver pieces. This place is huge and people get lost in there.  I have been here several times but never bought anything.  Most items are very expensive. Seems like some of the vendors don't want too sell their stuff!  Most of the jewelry seems to be more expensive then brand new.  The place is kind of like a museum.  Even if you don't buy anything it is still fun to go through.
1 Interesting Store with a diverse selection. Although for an Antique store in Phoenix, it's over priced.
