5 I went on the Premier Party Tours pub crawl on Saturday Jan. 11th 2014 and had an awesome time! We met at the social house in the Aria and had some drinks, then went to the Duce for more drinks and dancing. Brandon the host was a "Hoot"! Then we headed upstairs to Gold's (Mind you never having to wait in a line) and partied and danced a whole lot more! Then we made our way over to Haze and got the VIP treatment, no line or cover, no waiting... Very cool! After we spent and hour or so in "Bangin" Haze, a huge Limo bus picked all of us (18 in the group I think) and drove us all over to the Sapphire. We were dancing in the bus (With the included pole) and rocking out! I was so hammered! I would do this again with my friends because we met some really cool people in the group and had a real good time too.
5 Such a fun inexpensive experience! I loved it and had such a wonderful animated host!
5 Brandon is one of the easiest people to work with when planning tours to local bars.  I would recommended Premier Party Tours to any local bar looking to boost sales and fill up their bar a little earlier rather than later.  Great group of people, great host, great times ... what else could you possibly want!?
5 get your vip tour now had too much fun great host clubs and booze drink specials at every club....
5 I had a ridiculous amount of fun this last time around with Premier Party Tours. I got great and quick service from Brandon and his crew on both occasions. It's great to visit Vegas and not wait in a line  for half the night just for one bar.. So we hit more than enough to make our last trip to Sin City more than memorable lol thanks!! Will defiantly use again!! :-)
