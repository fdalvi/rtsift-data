5 This a probably one of the nicest CrossFit Gyms in the state. Now the facility is not the highest tech but the people/coaches well make up for it. They are constantly fixing up the place, bringing in new equipment and expanding. They are on hand and very personable. They will help you achieve your fitness goals.
4 A great CrossFit box way up in North Phoenix! The thing about CrossFit is that its communal, and its awesome that the people in N Phoenix have a place like this to workout. They just doubled their square footage, installed a sweet new rig and have great people in the gym.   A friend of mine goes to this box, as he lives only a mile away and he doesn't stop talking about it... But, that's normal for Crossfitter's right?  I went to their first open competition for local affiliates to come compete and they ran it very efficiently and made it supa fun.   If you live in N Phoenix and are ready to change your life.. hit up Spartanfit CrossFit!
