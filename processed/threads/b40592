5 Excellent, delicious, and awesome!!! Can't wait to go back! Great decor and service! I think this place is better than Mint Thai Cafe. Definitely worth a try. Me and my husband were more than pleased with the food/cleanliness/service and decor!
5 Was excited to see a new Thai place open up close to home. Was REALLY excited when I tasted the food. My wife and I shared Pad Thai Chicken and Red Curry and both were excellent. The service was friendly and fast, and the restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. We will definitely be back.
5 We were slightly unsure at first as we walked in and saw no one (but in all fairness it was the day after Thanksgiving), but ended up delightfully surprised! The food was excellent, the presentation was beautiful, and the service delightful. I wish I could give them ten stars!
2 I want to love this Thai place so close to home. Spouse  brought home takeout and forgot to ask them to omit the bell peppers. After carefully removing all the bell pepper from two entrees, I had a dinner size plate full of peppers and the entrees could now fit in a small coffee cup. The flavors were very good. We will try again.
5 Really like have a place this good so close to home.  The service is fast and friendly, the food is great, and the restaurants and very clean.  So far we have had the pad Thai, the eggplant, the yellow curry and a couple of the fried rice dishes.  Everything has been terrific.
3 Meh. It was ok.  I wasn't really impressed with this place. The food was ok and the service was ok, but it wasn't great.  The location certainly isn't great. I may take my family to see what they think and update my review since it was just mediocre.
