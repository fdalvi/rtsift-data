3 In a similar bracket to H Samuel, Warren James offers a good range of jewellery for all age groups at affordable prices. They tend to be hot on the latest jewellery trends offering copies of more pricier brands but at cheaper prices, perfect for gifts and if, like me, you're not too kind to your jewellery and are prone to misplacing it.   At the moment they have an extensive range of charms starting for as little as Â£6. This is perfect for children if you don't want to splash out on more expensive brands.
2 Staff were a bit slow to serve and at times I thought they had forgotten about us and the other two customers that were waiting.  I forgave this once were served, as the staff member was very efficient and we managed to make our decision, pay and get out of the shop really quick despite it being the end of the day.  The prices are really good but I'd hate to try shopping here when it's busy and you're not sure if what's in front of you is the right item or not.
