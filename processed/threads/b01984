4 This place is great! I love getting the first morning appointment. I'm in, they clean my teeth, and I'm out. Super easy and very friendly. They always call to confirm the day before and send the reminder card in the mail a few weeks before. Plus, if you go for cleaning every six months, you get two free tubes of whitening gel!!
1 Do not go to this office unless you want to be ripped off. I have been going to this group for 12 years. I have seen dentists come and go and never once have I had one cavity or had any spots even 'flagged'. I saw a new dentist this time and she not only talked down to me as if I was a child, she told me I have two cavities that needed filled.  They chose to show me "pictures" of my teeth and not the X-rays trying to make the case. Really?! I can tell you where I WON'T be going for my next cleaning.
4 I get soo nervous going to the dentist, but the people here are very nice and welcoming like a good friend!
