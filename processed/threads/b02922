5 This store is fun!  They have lots of little trinkets for me to fill my husband Christmas stocking with.
2 Puleze don't ever buy me a gift at Brookstone. I had no use for a $100 photo scanner so I took it back but they only do a store credit. Yikes! everything in this store is over priced stuff I wouldn't want if it was free, well maybe free. An example of some of my choices were an electric grill brush $30, two for $50 RC helicopters, a $75 neck pillow, what! No talking can openers? So, how did I get out of this mess you ask? I bought the scanner back with my "store credit" If you need a $100 photo scanner check Ebay.
4 Extremely friendly service, nice products and really cool things too! Was really happy with the way I was treated here. Little pricey on things but some are worth it! Especially the massage chair. Still plan on spending the $3000 to buy that thing. If anything stop in for a free massage!
