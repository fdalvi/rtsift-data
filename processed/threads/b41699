3 Since moving to Wisconsin, I have been searching for good grilled cheese sandwiches.  And, Melted certainly fits the bill.  I had the American Caprese sandwich, and it was a solid sandwich.  The pesto and tomatoes added a nice tang to the flavor.  I thought it was better than the grilled cheese at the Old Fashioned and Coopers Tavern, but not as good as Monty's.  All sandwiches come with a shot of tomato soup, which is not particularly remarkable.  The drawback was the price.  The basic sandwich is $6 and the specialty sandwiches are $8.  That was steep for a small, food-cart sandwich without a side.  In fact, I went over to Ian's right after for a slice of pizza to make a full lunch.  Again, the sandwich was quite good.  However, I would prefer to buy a slice of Ian's mac and cheese pizza and a slice of caprese pizza and a bag of puppy chow for the same price.
4 First time at this cart. Great experience. Staff was friendly and helpful. I opted for the jalepeno popper sandwich because it's first on the menu (and I plan to work my way thru it).   It was nicely grilled. Perfect, in fact. Gooey cheese and big slices of jalepeno. Delicious bread. A little cup of tomato soup for dunking on the side.   There are some great food carts on the square. This is looking to be a new favorite.
5 Delish!  Fun and yummy grilled cheese sandwiches that come with a shot of tomato soup...what's not to love?  And bonus, it's a food truck.
