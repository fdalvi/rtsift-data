1 Cancelled membership. Enough said....go to another location unless you enjoy wasting money. Location bounced chiropractors for several weeks and now they have a front end person that should be bounced.
1 Wish I could get my money back, left worse than I went in. Tried 2nd time and left without any relief. Purchased a month of visits. My other Chiropractor helps but not open on weekends so thought I would try this one.
