2 Snake pit.  If you are thuggish, and enjoy eighteen year old tramps, this may be your ideal bar.  Nothing good ever happens at Mad Ave. It is a rule of the universe.   Its sad, because this bar has some really good things going for it. It has three rooms total. One is a martini lounge, another a retro karaoke room and the last a grind pit of unattractive sweaty human flesh.  This bar is great for private events. This bar the was the site of my now infamous V-day 08  event. The staff is excellent when it comes to private events. They basically gave me run of the joint. Daddy likes.  MORE POEMS ! HAIKU TIME  !  Drinks are pathetic. Pass the hand sanitizer. Why did we come here ?  Talent Level: Very young. Very drunk. Very Annoying.
1 One time, my out of town friends were lost for hours looking for Madison Avenue (as in the street name).  Although it is certainly an upgrade from what was known as Club Amazon (think trees and a cage for drunk dirty girls to dance like gorillas in), I would not recommend going here unless you are very inebriated.  And by that I mean beyond imaginable as you will not likely be having a great of a time as those around you.  If you are colored good luck getting service at the bars.
1 This place shall be rated by negative stars for its absolutely grossness. First, the 18 year old doormen didn't honor the 21& over for free deal - false advertisement, then there were vomit and spilled drinks on the floor. No one cleaned up. Hello, Madison Avenue, the birth place of swine flu!
1 Large group of underagers here, horrible and overpriced drinks too.  The venue actually isn't terrible, but I've been in this place once, and will never return.  I have plenty of better things to do.
