4 Ladies, are you looking for gel nails? The salons call the real, true gel nails "gel gels." I have gone into and called countless nail salons looking for these "gel gel" nail services, only I didn't know the code word before today.   If you ask for "gel nails," they sit you down and put a "gel powder" on your nails and then follow up with the "gel" topcoat. These are not gel nails.   In the Goodyear/Avondale/Litchfield Park area, I have found 3 salons to offer true gel nails. And, a warning, 2 of the 3 salons only have 1 technician who can provide this service.  What to do?  Go to Vivian Nails.  Vivian Lee, the owner, did my nails today, but she said all of her staff can also offer the same service.   Discounts are offered for seniors, students, school faculty and military. Also, since it was my first time in, she gave me 10% off.
5 Best nail spa in the southwest valley. Everyone is very friendly and remembers you no matter how long it has been between visits.
