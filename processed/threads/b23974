5 WHY DID YOU HAVE TO CLOSE THIS LOCATION!!!!!! US GHETTO PEOPLE SHOP AT WHOLESALE WAREHOUSES TOO!!!! And its the closest one to where i live!!! Damn it!!! Costco here i come!! :(
4 I love Sams club and Costco because you get such a better value for your money.  Sams club has everything from golf stuff, to books, to alcohol...  I always spend $400 at least when I go in, but it is worth it :)
