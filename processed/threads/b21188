4 I adore Accessorize, and I can't browse without seeing something that I really want. I was in last week and got a gorgeous layered pearl bracelet with a fabric flower on it, it's so cute and I'd been looking for something like it for a while so I couldn't believe my luck when I saw it and it was a snip at £8!  They always have a great range of bags, stationary, lingerie, sunglasses, jewellery and various other knick knacks and if you want something gift wrapped you can get it wrapped in pretty tissue paper at the till.  I guess my favourite time at Accessorize is sale time where they often have as much as 70% off! I especially like the winter sale where I can stock up on gloves and other winter woolies 'cos lets fact it - you really can never have too many woolies when you live in Scotland!
3 Accessorize - the name pretty much sums up the contents of this chain store. There are two on Princes Street, which is quite understandable; they're both quite small and in the busier months one would hardly do.  I've admired a lot of their bags, hair accessories and bikinis, but for the quality of some of their pieces I find them largely over-priced. For example, I bought a pair of plastic flip flops, out of necessity really, which came up to £10. If they were especially attractive, I would have understood, but they were simply pieces of glorified rubber!  If I were looking for something special I would try the many unique and independently owned shops first.
