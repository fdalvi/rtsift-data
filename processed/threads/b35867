5 Very friendly staff, store is clean and well stocked.
4 No crowds here.  Usually I feel like I'm the only one in the store.  That being said I'll usually have three or four of the staff ask if they can help me.  I also adopted a cat at this location and have been very happy how that turned out as well.
1 I found the staff to be rude, disinterested, unhelpful and will never step foot inside there again. I refuse to give a BIG BUSINESS my pet business ever again. I am now a HUGE FAN of SNAZZY DOGS a GREAT!! place I found after taking my pets to this wreck of a crew.
4 For a Petsmart store, this location is usually pretty empty, but that's okay by me. I always get greeted when I walk in and there is always someone to help get me crickets right away! The grooming salon is good but don't use them too much, maybe 2times a year!
