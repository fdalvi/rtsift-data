5 They'll custom tint your paint for you and the customer service is a lot better than big box stores such as Home Depot, Lowes, and Walmart. Their paint is also a lot higher quality and will last you a lot longer. They have 30% off super sales a few times a year which makes for a killer deal if you happen to be working on a home improvement project and need to paint something.
5 I needed some touch up paint.  I had a tiny spec of a sample and they did their best to match it and said if I wasn't happy to come back.  Well, unfortunately it was a little darker and where I patched didn't come out like I would have wanted.  I went back a couple of weeks later and they redid it no problems and no additional cost.  They are very accommodating and even offered a larger size in case it wasn't a perfect match and I wanted to repaint the entire area I was trying to fix.  Their customer service is great.  All the employees I interacted with on my first visit were very friendly.  My only tip for them is to get some non painting type magazines cause it does take about 20-30 minutes for the process and that would make the wait easier.  Lol.   But for future this will be my store for paint and if you are in their computer system you get some great coupons.
4 I shop there all the time. Paul is a nice guy and takes care of me every time I am in there he is very helpful and knowledgable. Place gets hectic once in a while and the wait is kind of annoying. Overall a great place to shop for paint.
