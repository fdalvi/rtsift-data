5 Bought a new wedding ring here on valentines day. Rebecca helped us right away and she was awesome. Knew what she was talking about and helped me pick out a beautiful ring!
1 When I was browsing there today, I understood they all had customers so I didn't mind that I had to wait for a sales person to assist me. I waited a while, and once the sales person approached me, she decided to turn around and pay attention to someone else who just walked in (gave me to one second finger.) I returned to the store later and asked the same person to show me an item, and I politely thanked her after  because I didn't fall in love with the item and needed to think about it. She ignored my appreciation in her assistance and my comments about the item. She let me walk out without asking me if I had any other questions or anything else I wanted to look at. Both events that happened in the store today clearly shows that my business is not appreciated there.
