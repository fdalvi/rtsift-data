5 Adam is amazing! I've been going to him for over 5 years and would recommend to anyone!!!
5 Great place for hair and massage.  Adam is an amazing stylist.  My hair never looked so great.  The location is tucked in the back but worth discovering!
5 Adam is amazing and this salon does it all. From hair to massage, you will get fantastic service and results. The ambiance of the salon is amazing and they hit the nail on the head with the decor.
5 I give this place 10 stars! Lexi did I great job on my hair. The salon is spotless and the service is great. Will be going back for sure!
4 Discovered this place from Groupon. Cute salon with inviting decor. It's tucked in the back of a strip mall and can be difficult to find unless you know exactly what you're looking for.  Stacy did a 5 star excellent job! My color was perfect. She worked with me to trim up my hair to something I can live with since I'm trying to grow out a pixie cut. Plus the blow dry was great and amazingly fast.  Just one sour note, the receptionist is kinda rude and unhelpful. Unfortunately you have to deal with him for setting up an appointment and checking out. I'm not sure if it's just inexperience or personality. But, don't let that stop you from a getting a great hairstyle at this salon!
