5 Very clean, and comfortable hotel. Rob was so helpful and efficient. Wonderful stay.
2 It's a nice room but not good customer service. Waiting forever on the phone to get front desk to answer. Day managers were cool guys.
1 This hotel is terrible! The beds are uncomfortable. The pillows are uncomfortable. You can hear everything that is going on outside of the window and door.
5 Staff is Great!! I spent at least 15 nights here in recent months. Always get a warm friendly welcome. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Bed and pillows are comfortable. Good Breakfast and Coffee. Near everything I need to be near to. Staff gives great advice on things to do, places to go,and food It is my home away from home Would rather stay here then anywhere else in Madison
3 I had no complaints about the hotel until our last morning. The maid walked in at 7am! Not only did she enter the dark room, walk in to see us still in bed, but then she started talking to is about taking out the trash. We deliriously asked her to leave, and it took WAY too long for that to happen. Seriously not a good way to start the day. Especially because we planned on sleeping in. I understand that we probably forgot to put the "do not disturb" sign out... But WTF are maid doing even knocking on doors at 7 am!?!?!?!!? And why did she stop to chat with two clearly sleeping guests!?
