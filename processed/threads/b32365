4 I've driven by this little Mexican market a million times and finally decided to give it a try. It looks small from the outside and feels even smaller inside. They packed everything in pretty tight. I came here to buy some pre-seasoned carne asada for some homemade tacos. The quality of the stuff I got looked better than similar meat at Los Compadres, although the flavor/seasoning/marinade of the meat from Los Compadres was probably bolder. The meat at El Gordito was also pricier at about $6.20 a pound, I think, compared to $5.99 at LC.   Also got some pinto beans, which were tasty. Other items purchased (cilantro, jalapeños, and avocados) were fairly priced and in good condition. I'd come here again.
4 I was driving on the other side of town when I saw this little Mexican market, and I mean little, but I was surprised how much stuff they have in there, it's like a little of EVERYTHING in there ! They  have a kitchen where you can order from breakfast, to lunch and even dinner, but you can't eat there, they sell beer, regular groceries and the best part, they have a meat department, good prices and vast quality! I've been going there for like 2 months now, very convenient,  I really like the people there, they are helpful and friendly.
5 I've reviewed my go to carniceria, El Gordito, before and its only fitting I do again this cinco de mayo. Another a+ batch of carne asana and hot salsa this weekend.... Muy bueno senors y señoritas!
1 I live close to El Gordito super market, I go there NOT so often, there are flys EVERYWHERE! The hot and ready food that is out to serve is always left open. The food gets dried, they still serve it that way! Dried food + flys = NASTY! I Bought a Torta and when I tried it, the meat was ROTTEN. Tasted Disgusting! Also, You can see Flys in the glass display, where the Bread is in! Gross!
