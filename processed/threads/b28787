1 Poor and unfriendly service. Calamari was as tough as shoe leather. When dish was returned barely touched server still charged for the bad appetizer. Fryer oil extremely dirty. Too many other run of the mill Thai restaurants to visit. Won't be back!
4 Echt een aanrader Real Thais en zeer vriendelijke bediening en super lekker
4 Visited this restaurant with friends, on a recommendation, and we weren't disappointed. The atmosphere is nothing to write home about, but it's nice enough. The food and service were pretty stellar though. All of us ordered different dishes from pad thai to curry to peanut chicken and we were all equally impressed.   Being able to choose the level of spice of your meal (from five or six different levels) was a huge perk and allowed for multiple points of entry, from those who are afraid of spice, like myself, to seasoned world travelers like our friends who ordered their meals HOT.  The meals themselves were fairly huge and great value for money. The service was also incredibly prompt, polite, and personable. We were impressed with how quickly our food came. Would definitely return.
5 Best Thai place in Kitchener Waterloo. I am confused by some of these negative reviews because the place is amazing. We recently moved back from Toronto and it is better than all of the places we used to eat in Toronto.   I recommend the Thai Peanut, Drunken Noodle or Pad Pak
4 Super good! Went here based on other reviews. Really enjoyed everything we ordered which included Tom Yum Soup, Pad Thai, Green Curry, Fried Rice, 2 kinds of rolls. Prices are fair for the appetizers, a bit on the expensive end for the meals. But the portions are generous, so you can think about sharing.   Servers are very nice and attentive. We never had to ask to have our water refilled. Cute restaurant, good flavours, nice staff. If I ever find myself back in Waterloo and craving Thai I'd definitely stop in here.
