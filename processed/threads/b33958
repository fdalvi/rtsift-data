5 I have been dealing with Swat for about 15 years or so and wouldn't have anyone else at this point. I especially like that if a problem arrises between services they will come out and correct it at no additional charge.
1 This company is only interested in the bottom line! Cindy "the bosses wife" is especially heinous! Very poor customer service...it's interesting how their best "review" isn't even recommended by yelp, as it is SWAT who left it! The field techs are great but, unfortunately it's the practices behind the scenes that are so very unethical! There are much more reputable & honest companies than this one for pest control, stay away at all costs!
3 I've been using Swat Bug Killers for a number of years.  The only reason I've continued to use their service is because the service guys are wonderful and the product if good.  Now having said that, Linda in the office has to be one of the most unpleasant individuals around.   She's very difficult to deal with, if the service and product was not top notch I would have found another provider.  It's just when I have to deal with her over the  phone that it becomes annoying.  I've complained to the service guys many times and they ALL AGREE how unpleasant this woman is. If it wasn't for this woman Linda I would give them the 5 stars that they deserve, but to me Customer Service is a big part of the service.   I've considered getting a hold of the owner to complain and maybe the next time she gives me a hard time I will do just that.
