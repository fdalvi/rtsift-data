5 I think they have a Panda Express at every casino/mall in vegas now.  This one is no different.  Food is fake chinese - but tasty nonetheless!
4 I agree with the majority of the reviews about all Panda Express restaurants. It is not authentic Chinese food. However, it is always made fresh at the store and it is very flavorful. What they do not have in authenticity they make up for it in consistency and good value.
3 Since friend was getting hungry and didn't want to eat my yogurt dish, we opted to get chinese food.  Yes, it's not real chinese food but it'll do if you're hungry and want something filling.  I thought the food was pretty tasty since we ordered the chow mein, mushroom chicken and orange peel beef.  The only bad part was that both friend and I got upset stomachs later on in the night.  Not sure what happened here since we do eat at Panda Express near us and we never had a problem before.  So I guess it was an off night for both of us. =/
5 Panda express is SOOOO BOMB!!! I was here for EDC 2013, stayed at the palms place penthouse and was like DAMN! munched out everyday to something new. The chow mein good, orange chicken? BETTER. The girl at the front was all hot too and was like where you from and I was like outerspace!! I tried the whole menu in my entire EDC experience. Thank you panda express you saved my hunger from the ruff weekend.
