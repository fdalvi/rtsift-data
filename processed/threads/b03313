1 Hall of Frames stinks.   They recently started advertising with Yelp and have repeatedly complained to Yelp about a 100% genuine and honest 3 star review I wrote about my experience with their service. So Yelp has removed it twice. Now it's rewritten and a 1-star review:  80% of the cuts on their frames are very sloppy. They try to cover it up with putty and hope you won't notice.   Fortunately, the guys at this Scottsdale store are really nice and they have a no-hassle re-make policy.  Unfortunately, they've jacked up their prices. A lot. Now, even with a coupon, their current prices are at about the same level as their non-discounted prices from a few months ago. Now it's no longer worth all the hassle to get custom frames from HOF.  Save your money and go someplace else where they will do the job right the first time.
