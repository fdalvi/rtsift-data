5 Have tried a few different items here ...  Cheese pizza is great, the cheese actually taste like cheese, and they don't skimp on it either. New York style crust, nice and crispy... None of that soggy bottom garbage here. And, you can still fold it to eat it right.  Calzone is real good...lots of filling and again that great crust. (You have to ask for a side of sauce as you don't get it off the bat)  Why 5 stars you ask??  The Meatball sub was amazing!! Great roll, tons of sauce & meatballs for days. Not one of those small dry things you get at some places either, these meatballs were amazing.
5 Next to the dry cleaner so had to stop and try.  Very pleased. Simple old school pizza place but they make a descent slice if you don't mind slightly greasy NYC style pizza.   Better than expected from the little shopping center. Check it out.
5 One of the best pizzas I've had and one of the most nicest people. They are always smiling and you leave smiling once your done! A must visit place...
