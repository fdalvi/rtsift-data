3 Cute dog park with plenty of parking and segregated dog areas for small and large dogs.  There are some shady areas too for people to sit and relax in.  Mostly grass, but there are dirt spots too.  Only bad part there are some strange homeless type characters that hang out there and can cause drama and the water fountains were NOT working so make sure to bring water for your dog.
5 This park has an area for dogs to play with each other. The park has three play grounds for children.
4 Lots of shade in playground area, great on the summer days.
5 Numerous kid playgrounds, picnic areas, fitness system, great running trail and dog park!! Love this park. Clean and well kept.
