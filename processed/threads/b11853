4 Yummy Mexican food, but the atmosphere feels like a chain. Still worth it for the chips and salsa. This one is really close to Scottsdale Fashion Square mall.
4 When clients came to town wanting a Mexican flavor - but something really casual - we took them here. This happened more often that you might think really.  And while it worked great for the really casual folks, the building itself is nice enough that for folks who are normally anything but casual, they feel comfortable too.    In this location service has always been wonderful, but the star is really the decor.  While the food is clearly "chain" food, the location is built in a "we take pride in this location" kind of way.  Good lighting through the place.  Pretty cozy bar area - though there are enough tables to support a larger group.    Everything in here just feels so cozy and comfortable - including the really nice wait area, that you almost forget you are in a big chain. Much "nicer" experience overall than most of their other locations.
4 I am always interested to see if I like the Mexican food in the region I am visiting.  Being semi-close to Mexico I would imagine the food would be authentic... this place did not have the homemade taste.  Don't get me wrong, the beans were perfect and so was rice.  It just misses that one little taste I am always searching for.  I have to admit, the waitress messed up on one of the orders and to compensate she gave us some fried ice-cream.  That in itself propels this to a 4.
