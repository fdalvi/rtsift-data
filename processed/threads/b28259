5 If you are looking for a great location for bulk specialty flours and grains, beans, Freeze Dried fruits, vegetables, meats and dairy...they have a wonderful selection. They also have water storage and emergency supplies like solar ovens. I'm a big fan!
5 I have been here multiple times and each time the staff has been superb.  Their selection is also awesome.  I would highly recommend.
5 This place is a find for great deals on gourmet foods. The focus seems to be on food... hoarding? Preparedness? There are lots of big cans of food that will last forever, but that can workout in your favor even if you're not storing it long term. Many of their large tins of ingredients are crazy cheap, and the packaging makes it convenient to reseal and use at your leisure. They have a great selection of gourmet flours, beans, honey, baking mixes, dehydrated veggies, and sundries like solar ovens and canning supplies. I'll definitely be back.
5 They have the best price on Almond Flour. Even cheaper than online.   It is like a big warehouse with options towards grains etc. You can buy whole grains such as wheat etc but they carry a large variety of gluten free things too. Plus they have gluten free baking classes every thursday at 10:00am.
5 Great people, great prices, hard to beat anywhere in the valley, but even if there was a cheaper place elsewhere I don't think It'd make a difference, the people are so knowledgeable and friendly I really don't see the point.  If you're storing, or do long term minimalist camping like my family, or even are just curious to make some REAL home made bread from scratch, this place is a must-visit.
