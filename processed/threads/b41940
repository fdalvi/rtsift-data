5 This place is really good. They use premium Blue Bell Ice Cream and their ice is like eating a cloud. They serve ice cream. Hawaiian style snow cones.  Ton of different flavors to choose from. They had my favorite, Tigers Blood. You can add sweet cream to the top. Very inexpensive. My family of 4 all got treats and the total was under $10.
5 Great place. Convenient location. Great product. I had a vanilla with cherry, orange and pineapple with a little cream on top and it was perfect! Great owners! Great service!
5 Awesome place right next to  LA Fitness. Our family of four stopped in tonight for some true Hawaiian shave ice.  We tried guava and Tigers blood with vanilla ice cream   Yummy stuff.  The owners were very kind and engaging people. We will be back!
