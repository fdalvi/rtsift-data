5 I recently started working with Mark, who is based at the Scottsdale location.  He is one of the most knowledgeable therapists I have worked with.  He is also personable and empathetic not to mention very nice to work with.  The rest of the staff is also rather awesome to deal with.  Hurt?  Well, after you talk to a doctor, I would personally suggest you talk to these folks.  There is also a Goodyear office too, and though I have not been, they're likely just as good.    Not often I offer 5 stars, but 5/5.
1 I went there 2 times for a back problem. The first time they gave me full attention and i was very satisfied .The second time they split my time with someone else ,and i had about 15 minutes of time. However they had no problem charging my insurance company and myself for full service . When i called and complained they made all kinds of excuses,and still wanted the money, instead of saying it was the wrong thing to do. Ipaid them , however i would never return. buyer beware.
5 I am the person who does not believe in physical therapy. That is until I was referred by a friend to Landmark Physical Therapy (previously AZOPT). The staff is exceptional; very helpful and friendly. Mark is extremely knowledgeable and very good at what he does. I have some issues that prevent me from doing the "typical" exercises...Mark came up with terrific alternatives that help keep my progress going. I look forward to going and always feel better when I leave. If you need PT, THIS is the place to go!
