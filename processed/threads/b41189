5 Stopped on Valentines Day and was greeted in a very nice way by enthused staff.  Ordered latte, extra hot with minimal foam.  Made perfectly!  Parking and entry was easy approaching from the west.  They have a drive thru which I will try next week.  Latte was good, coffee of high quality.  Prices reasonable and got one dollar off for VDay!  Thanks guys!
5 Great spot. Good coffee. Friendly staff. Not a lot if seating but the drive though is great.
5 A nice quiet hangout for getting work done, with good coffee.  Area was clean, and staff was very friendly.  I also loved the fresh flowers on each of the tables!
4 Working just a few doors down I was excited to see a drive thru high quality coffee shop coming in!  I've been twice so far, and love it!  If you pull to the drive thru and there's someone at the window, a very friendly staff member will walk out to your car window and greet you, take your order, and it it started inside!  The first time I had the iced Jamaican coffee with a shot added to it (a staff recommendation) and it was fantastic,,,slight hint of maple sweetness!  Today I had an iced hazelnut latte, again delish!  Friendly customer service, great quality, a drive thru for chilly winter days...I'm sold!  Look for it in the building shared with Forward Dental just before Whitney Way!
5 I used to frequent the East Side location and I am excited the have moved out west, too. Their drinks are of excellent quality, though sized a little larger than average coffee shops, which can drive up the price depending on what you order.   Their Iced Jamaican Coffee is without question the best iced coffee beverage I have ever had. Marry it with the almond milk they stock and you are in for a cup of bliss.
