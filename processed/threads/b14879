5 We have had two visits to this dental office (Dr. Jacobson is our dentist).  I was immediately impressed by the office staff.  They are friendly and sociable, and even remembered specifics about my child on our second visit a month later.  I love that kind of attention to detail!  The waiting room is adorably decorated in a pirate theme.  There are touch-screen computers with sports video games that even the little kids can easily play, plus a number of other activities to keep the kids engaged.  I swear, I'm thinking about bringing my son here during the hot summer - just to play! ;)  During our consult and cavity-filling session with Dr. Jacobson, I was incredibly impressed.  He was caring and genuine, and took the time to explain all of our options in great detail.  He knew we had switched dentists because of their aggressive treatment plan, and was very considerate of our comfort level with the procedure.  I am so happy that we switched dentists.    Places and people like this are a true find!
5 I am very pleased with Phoenix Pediatric Dental. I have been taking our 4yr old here for a couple years & I started taking our 1yr old as well. The office is very clean & completely caters to kids. The staff is great, very professional and amazing with our boys. Their scheduling department is wonderful & always calls you if they have a sooner appointment to see if you would like it. I'm very happy I found Phoenix Pediatric Dental and recommend them to anyone I know.
1 Great dentists but front office is terrible. Always late for appointments. Communications are terrible. I am switching dentists simply because of the poor office management.
