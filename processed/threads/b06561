5 Bellezza opened while I was a student in Madison, and I was one of their first regular customers.  I really enjoyed coming here from the get-go and over a couple years had my hair routinely cut/colored, manicures, and waxes.  I honestly can't complain about any of the services I received.  Valerie is the owner and I always went to her.  She was extremely professional, knew her stuff, great conversationalist, and I always left feeling great!  They never pressured you to buy any of their products or additional services.  It was a great atmosphere and felt more like hanging out with my girlfriends than going to a salon.  The price is reasonable, especially considering the attention to detail I received.  I definitely missed going there after I moved and highly recommend it in comparison to the other Madison options!
4 I've walked past this place about 100 times, and every time I pass it, I think, " I NEED A HAIRCUT!"  So today when I finally had time & motivation to get my hair colored & cut, I called Bellezza.  They were really accommodating, I asked when they'd be able to get me in & they told me to come over right away.  The stylist was excellent.  She must have the patience of a saint, because she was cheerful & friendly throughout the whole process, even though my hair is really thick & takes FOREVER to color & she probably wasn't expecting to spend most of her afternoon on me :)  My hair turned out great, I love it, I'd definitely go back.
5 I got possibly the best manicure of my entire life here. I don't remember the girls' name, but she is currently apprenticing. This place is clean, new-feeling, friendly, and they definitely take their time.
