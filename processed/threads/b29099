3 Decent park tucked away from major streets, in the middle of some nice looking neighborhoods. Like all other parks in the city, it has two play areas. One for toddlers and one for bigger kids. There's a nice-sized grassy area with several tables and charcoal grills. There's not a lot of shade, so on really hot and sunny days the playground equipment can be extremely hot. It's a decent park to visit if you live nearby, but not worth it if you live on the other side of town.
5 Very clean park for walks and late night jogs.  Never been here during the day, always late at night past midnight.   This place is special to me since it's the place I walk around with someone in my life that I will always care about.  She lives only nearby and was also the one that invites me to walk late night for long conversations about life and plans.  In the day, it seems like a nice place to take your kids because of the safe padded playground in the center.  Also has a restroom conveniently located the playground and surprisingly clean considering its a public park.  During summer though, you will be exposed to the sun since there's hardly any place for shading at all.
3 Nice facilities and landscaping. Enjoyed the history notes. Lots of playground stuff for kids.
5 My kids love it! We found it on yelp last spring and came back when we were in town again. I think we will visit every time we come to Vegas.
2 Small Park with open area to just walk around or play in the middle. No fenced area for dogs to play. it's good for kids. There is two play area for little kids & bigger kids. Not worth it if you don't live close.
4 Cute park, my kids love playing here. There are trails to walk around. The play structures are covered now. Doesn't get very crowded either which is nice!
4 We visited this place with our grandson and had a great time. Lots of playground toys for him to play on.  We enjoyed our time here. My only complaint was that I felt there could have been more trees around the playground area.
5 Beautiful landscaping in the summer, spare yet majestic in the winter. Quite, calm, relaxing, serine.
