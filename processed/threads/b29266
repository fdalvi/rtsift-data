4 We recently had a house fire on 3-15-13 and when the time came to remove contents from our home for inventory we had a bad experience with the company that we were originally going to hire for the job.    However, Absolut Restoration, a company recommended by our insurance company and a family friend came to the rescue.  Absolut Restoration was very professional, nice and real detailed on our inventory sheets.  They did an amazing job and we are truly thankful that they helped us during our time of need.  Misty one of the owners was very nice and explained everything in detail to us so that there would be no surprises.  There was no high pressure tactics and we never felt that we were being taken advantage of which is common after a house fire.    We did have an issue that came up during inventory of the contents but that was resolved amicably.  Absolut Restoration is a company that has experience and all of their employees work very hard it was a pleasure working with Absolut Restoration and their content team.
4 These guys are Awesome!  Have known so many people starting with even back during the Rodeo Chediski fire in the high country who have been cleaned up after a tragedy by Absolute.. Do great work and easy to work with..
