5 The guy who helped me out was super friendly.  It was a prepaid return so he probably didn't make any money on me but he made a great first impression.
1 The guy who helped me was really rude and barely said a word to us. Didn't even give us the different price options and it ended up costing a lot more than we expected. Unfriendly and made us, the customers, feel like a nuisance.
5 Great place. I've had no problems there. Friendly staff. Easy parking. Mail is delivered on time. Shipping is easy! Go there, you won't be disappointed!
1 Okay the staff was some what friendly. The software they use for their mailing is terrible!!! Couldn't find any addresses even though google maps did. Overpriced as well, they just try and charge you the most expensive deal! What the heck. I dropped off and mailed a package a week ago. Just got a confirmation email that it was mailed. Over a week ago! The package should have been mailed the next day via USPS and would have been there already. Just go to the Post Office, fed ex or a real UPS store.
