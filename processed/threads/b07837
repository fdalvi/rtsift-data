1 Santis Pet Clinic was the worst veterinarian's office I have EVER been to. The environment was hostile and unprofessional. The manager was making jokes about killing and degrading a specific employee in front of the customers, myself included! When I brought to her attention that I was uncomfortable and I should not have to witness this hostile behavior; she informed me it was none of my business and I should shut my mouth.  I then told her I work as an administrative assistant for a CEO and could never imagine him talking to me that way or a paying customer. At this point she got irate and began bad mouthing me. My fiancé informed her and the veterinarian (owner) that we were paying customers that did not come here to be insulted. She then got hostile with my fiancé completely ignoring the veterinarian's (owner) request to stop. I am shocked and appalled at the customer service provided and the horrible things that came out of her mouth! No matter the circumstance, we were the customers and should not have been degraded this way, especially in front of a room full of people.
2 We took our Chihuahua for Anal gland Abscess. Veterinarian suggested for a surgery worth $400. Our visit with a shot cost us $55. Not sure what the shot is for, if the only option is surgery.  Next I come home to find online that surgery is the most barbaric thing to do with the dogs and is not suggested. I'm going to take that $55 loss and go see some other doctor.  Not to mention, this place is in ghetto, looks and smells like it. Veterinarian couldn't speak good English. I didn't feel like I could get answers from him, so no point in discussing further.   I'm not coming back and will stay miles away from this area!
