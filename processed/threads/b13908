4 Cashed a few checks at this branch.  The teller was very friendly and helpful.  I was in/out within 5 minutes and it was 11 am on a Thursday.  The only downside is that the entrance to the bank has only one driveway which is on the Northeast corner of the road when you're driving North on Scottsdale Road.  If you miss it, you have to drive around a little bit because of how the lights and U-turn restrictions are setup in the area.  Return Factor - 80%
1 I have never really had an issue with wells fargo, I love banking with them. But this old bitter red head would totally be a reason for me to never come to this location again. I went to the atm outside and after three people walked away looking confused, I tried my card. The atm was having an error and unable to process any transactions. So naturally I go inside to let someone know they are losing business because of a faulty machine. I let the teller know whats wrong and  red head beastzilla, rudely tells the girl I'm probably in the negative and my account is delinquent.  It definitely was not either of those two. Then Horrid beast lady tells me they haven't had any complaints all day and maybe it was just my accounts. I wasn't trying to complain, just letting someone know so they could have it fixed.... I hope she gets fired for poor customer service skills.
