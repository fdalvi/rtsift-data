4 This is one of my wife's favorite Japanese Restaurant in Las Vegas. The atmosphere is nice, the service is  and the food is excellent. I especially love their California Roll with real crab, melt in my mouth goodness. The soups, sushi, makki, everything is great here. If your looking for great Japanese Food with a nice calm atmosphere this is the Restaurant I would recommend to you. We'll be back.
4 we ate here before the criss angel show. she ordered the lobster with a mushroom sauce which was really good. the sauce made the dish. i wanted to get the kobe beef but after i heard it was american kobe beef and that it was 225.00 i lost my appetite for it. if i'm going to pay that kind of price, i want real kobe beef from japan. i ended up with the beef teriyaki with tempura, nothing special. overall it was a positive dinner, the place was nice and the service was great.
