5 So glad I found Service Master. Joe visits our Scottsdale office every few weeks to do a deep cleaning. All the floors, countertops, desks, windows, shelves, bathrooms, etc. What a wonderful time-saving service and a great value too. Mention me and Yelp for a "special deal"... (I'm trying to show Joe that Yelp works... He is the owner and WILL take care of you!)
5 If you are tired of the clean you don't get from your service provider, then let Joe at Service Master hook you up.  He has followed our (Landlords) janitorial service three times to clean our carpets and floors, they stay clean after Joe at Service Master gets them that way. I tried to get my Landlord to get a quote from Joe, but I think he owns a part of their cleaning service so he said no. Don't let your office get dirty, call Joe he will clean your office the way it should be clean!
5 Service Master cleans my floors in my restaurant and I have to tell you that Joe's attention to detail is OUTSTANDING!!!!!! My floors have never looked better. He had allot of work ahead of him when he started a year ago. He always called the next day to make sure the floors were to my expectation. I have to say I never had to call Joe out to do a retouch. I would reccomend Joe. If you want it done right the first time Joe is your man!!!! Thanks Joe for making my floors look wonderful!!!!
