5 Found their ad on Craiglist when I was looking to get some work done on my jeep.  I called and was very quickly able to get an over the phone estimate on parts and labor for the work requested.  They also gave me different option for pricing on parts due to their expertise. I would highly recommend Raven Industries to all my friends or anyone that is looking to get some fabrication or drive train work done, even basic mechanic repairs.
5 Raven Industires is your one stop shop for any fabrication and differential work. Ray and Rico are very knowledgeable and have specialized in this field for years. They will present you with many options to meet your needs.
5 I am a local business owner and use Raven for all my fab needs. Ray is a great person to deal with and doesn't B.S. you and give you the run around. Him and Ivan both do awesome work and usually less expensive than the big guys with better service. Definitely give them a chance to earn your business.
