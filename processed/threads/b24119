5 Robert over at Mobile One is a pro at fixing smart phones.  I was in Madison (from San Francisco) and my Android Evo screen shattered and was not usable.  Robert got me in Same Day and fixed my phone while I waited.  A total rush job and very much appreciated.  He also emailed me a receipt.  I totally recommend them over any other repair place!
2 I have been to get my phone fixed there twice. The repair was good although the customer service is horrible. I was always rushed when I was talked to. The guy I spoke with was always rude. I kept going because of the good work and low price. But the customer service has completely turned me off from going again to this business.
1 The guy who runs this place may be good at repairing phones, but leaves a lot to be desired regarding customer service.  I brought in a phone that had water damage.  I took it to another phone repair place in town who wasn't able to do much for me.  On a recommendation, I brought it here to see if Mobile One could anything for me.  When I told the guy the backstory, he proceeded to take a few minutes to explain to me how terrible the other place is, running down the list of reasons why he's way better, while simultaneously refusing to even look at my phone because he "Won't touch it after the other place had touched it."  Then offered me a deal on a refurbished phone.   Hence the one star.  I don't doubt they're capable at fixing phones.  However, I left with the impression they're difficult and unhelpful.
