5 I used to be afraid to go to the dentist before Dr. Mathews worked on my mouth. I chose Dr. Mathews because he had great reviews and was willing to bill both my insurances, which not all dentist are willing to do. I got several fillings and he made me very comfortable. My husband also got some fillings and said he was happy with Dr. Mathews. We both think he's a great dentist.
5 Dr. Matthews is very competent and a really nice guy. He tells you what he's doing as he goes through procedures. The people in his office are also very nice and professional.   I will also post this review on Acacia Dental, which is Dr. Matthews' office. I recommend these people.
