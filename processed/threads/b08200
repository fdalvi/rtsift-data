4 Good service with a quick turn around on big jobs, can't ask more than that. The prices are right too.
1 I would give 0 stars if I could. Worst customer service I have ever had. Not even greeted when I came in. No one asked what I needed help with. Took forever for a very small job. Inefficient and unfriendly. Go to Kinkos, yes it's more expensive but you can get in and out fast and the staff isn't RUDE and doesn't mess up your order.
1 Not customer oriented. No real leadership, there's like no manager to speak to here. Hopefully this place goes out of business machines here are old and hard to use.
4 they have been able to do everything I needed for a great price. Very helpful staff and good quality work.
3 I just discovered this place. I come here when I need to fax something or get color copies. The price of color copies is half the price you'd fetch at Kinko's just three blocks to the east. It's about the same turnaround time. Americopy can definitely get me out of a bind. However, Todd always looks at you, the customer, as if you have two heads. Look at the Google reviews for this Americopy and you'll see that he treats everyone this way. I don't know if it's age and he just hasn't had exposure to lots of different kinds of people. He himself appears quite normal. I look normal. Just smile, Todd. It's Phoenix and there's tons of weirder people than me here.
