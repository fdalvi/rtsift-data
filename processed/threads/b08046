5 Daves place has been a staple of the strip mall for almost as long as it has been there, yet I never went in. With the new law of no smoking in public places my eyes have been awakened to a ton of new dive bars.   Dive Bar:   Small...check  Dimly Lit... check  Pool/darts/shuffle board...check  Locals...check  Cool Bar staff... check   The place had maybe 40 people in it before we brought in our 7 more. We were able to get a pub table and put our names in for the shuffle board.   The bartender was busy but not rushed, she knew how to handle the crowd and still make good drinks. The prices were good as far as I can say, but I only drink Capt and coke.   We had a good time and there was no drama at all. The crowd was a nice mix of 70 year old men down to 21 year old bike mechanics.
2 Not a bad dive bar. Nothing to write home about. Been there a few times good prices and friendly staff!
5 A bar within walking distance (albeit a bit of a long walk) is a very happy time!  Their beer selection is pretty ho' hum and the big screen projection screen TV has seen better days, but the clientele and pitcher prices are second to none.   When it comes to entertainment during your intoxicated adventure they got you covered.  Pool, darts, jukebox (The internet kind, nice!), FREE shuffleboard (Unless you really need a machine keeping track of your points.), and golden tee/buck hunter style arcade games are all at your disposal.   I've spent many a long night at Dave's and will continue to do so, not just because of the proximity, the prices or the games, but the atmosphere and interesting individuals you're inevitably going to run into.
5 Wow, I loved this place!  The last time I have been in was in 2007.   I first came in, in 2002, with a musician boyfriend of mine back then. He told me about this place and took me. I loved it the minute we sat down and drank something. It was great. I have been here about 5 times (4 times with him, before we broke up).   Drinks are reasonably priced and the bartenders were very nice. The patrons were very down home and friendly. Located in a great spot, near some great restaurants (like Applebee's).   Gosh, I'd like to visit again, one day.
5 First time there last night, gotta say I loved it. It's nothing like a Scottsdale bitch bar, it's friendly and relaxed. It's that place you can hit after a hard days work. Completely affordable, my friends and I were shocked at how low our bill was. We've already agreed we'll head there more.
3 Great little place, lot's of games to play, cheap drinks. Needs more pool tables, or patrons who are willing to let other people play, and not hog the table.
5 One of my favorite local dive bars.  Drinks are cheap and the shuffleboard is free.  We have been here numorous times with a small group and never had a problem finding a place to sit.    One of the cool things about  this place is I work graveyard shift and I can come here @ 6am to get a frosty cold adult beverage after a long night of work.
4 This is one of my favorites on a lazy Saturday afternoon. Round up a few friends for some shuffle board and beers!
4 Daves is a great little dive bar.  The bar staff is friendly but also willing to give you a wise ass when it's appropriate.   The prices are always reasonable and you will never complain about a weak cocktail.
