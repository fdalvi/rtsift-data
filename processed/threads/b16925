5 This is an excellent UPS Store.   The employees are always fast, friendly, and professional. The store will let you use their pens and tape when you need to pack items for shipping. They always have a notary on staff that is knowledgeable and efficient.   So, if you need to ship items, get documents notarized, or make copies this is a good place to do business with.
5 Great great customer service! Every time I come in here I get great service.
