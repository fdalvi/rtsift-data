5 I recently had SharpShine Professional Automobile Detailing perform a platinum package on my 2007 Audi. I was amazed on how they were able to make it look like new again. Their team of professionals are very meticulous and thorough. Keep up the great work!!
5 These guys are the best Auto Detailers in the valley! They do everything from a simple hand-wash to a complete showcase detail. They're extremely nice and clean! They take their time on every job, making sure their work satisfies the customer as well as themselves. I wouldn't go anywhere else but here. I highly recommend SharpShine Auto Detailing to everyone.
