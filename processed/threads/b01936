5 Fantastic service, and great staff. The owner is a stand-up guy - what else can I say? We go there for snow cones and ice cream, and always stay to chat with the owner.
4 This place has Thrifty Ice Cream. Pistachio ice cream is the truth!! The water tastes great here and I couldn't ask for more. yay! There is a .35 charge on your card if your total purchase is less than five dollars. FYI
5 Love this location! The staff is always very courteous, friendly, and they make it a fun experience. They have the normal water and ice stuff, but also have a great selection of ice cream, snow cones, and other goodies. Definitely a place that I recommend!
