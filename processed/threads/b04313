2 Good deals for cheap food - recently they had a $2 breakfast special consisting of two egg & cheese burritos with hashbrowns.  Hard to beat that.  Location is next to Einstein's, Starbucks, and Chipotle - so whether it is breakfast or dinner, there's a superior alternative in the same parking lot.
5 Great food! Good prices.
