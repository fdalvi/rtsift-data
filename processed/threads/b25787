1 They got one star because I do have counter tops, but only after blood, sweat, tears and utter agony.  I got a townhouse in January that needed a complete re-haul and my contractor suggested Elegant Granite for my counter-tops.  To make a long story short, they put a huge seam (like a keloid scar) in my counter-top and first blamed it on not enough granite (there was, they calculated to do it in one piece), then on it breaking on their way over.  They recanted that when I pointed out I had the same granite in my old house with a much larger piece.  Eventually she just gave up and stated that I didn't specify no seams so I got seams.  I got a massive slab of granite so that it required no seams.  No seams is a given.  I would have done granite tiles and saved a lot of money of I wanted seams.  Additionally, they tried to over charge me close to $800 but backed down when I fought them.  End of story, I will definitely use Franco's marble again the next time I do granite.  Never again will I use Elegant Granite and I will tell everyone I know not to use them.  08/24/11  Simona comented on my review and yet she still can't stick with a single reason for the seam.  In the future I will always use Franco's.  Trust me on this, immaculate work and first class service even a year later when you chip the edge of the counter yourself.
2 I had Elegant Granite install granite in my kitchen and bathrooms.  The job was perfectly done and I love  my granite.  BUT their customer service after the sale is atrocious! They rarely call back when you leave a message.  They have never contacted me to find out if I liked the job.  It's as if once they have your money they are done with you!
5 We used Elegamt Granite twice now and enjoyed our experience both times. The prices were reasonable and the service was excellent.  We will definitely use them again.
