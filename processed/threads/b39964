5 James is The Man! Was very frustrated that Verizon sold me a Bluetooth that became defective in less than a Month; non of the stores on my side of town had one so they last guy said I know one store that has two units and sent me way over to the other side of town. James was able to swap out my Bluetooth, sinked it to both of my phones and keep a pleasant demeanor even though it was a difficult task.  Some of my favorite restaurants are around this store so I may have to swing by again the next time I have phone issues!
5 HANDS DOWN, THE BEST VERIZON STORE I'VE EVER BEEN TO!!!!  I was ready to give up on Verizon after multiple experiences at other stores.  Left my iPhone in a cab and needed quick service.  OMAR and JORGE were PHENOMENAL!!!!  Omar was so patient and helpful, he had multiple solutions for all my requests.  He deserves some sort of award!!!!  Thanks guys for all of your help:):):)
5 Jorge Arballo is absolutely fantastic. I flew into Las Vegas from Dallas for the weekend. My phone died at the airport and was completely useless. When I arrived at the store Jorge took the time to figure out what my best course of action was. He got me set up with the best phone and a discount that I didnt know about since i have a specific plan. He was efficient and courteous during the whole deal even though I was stressed and exhausted. When you decide to stop in see Jorge and he will take great care of you!
