3 It's a BP station. Guy running the place seems so melancholic. He was daydreaming when I entered to get a key for the washroom... he didn't let me interrupt his daydream, gazing up into the sky through the front window, while pointing to the key hanging beside the door...
4 Thanks to Matt W's picture, I recognized that I stop at this particular BP quite often.   Pros:  + Super easy to get in-and-out of + Prices are on-par with everyone else + The morning cashier is always friendly and helpful + Nice selection of grab-n-go "food" (mostly packaged stuff) + Bonus: the sign that posts little "thoughts" is usually quite humorous + Easy to access air compressor (fee based, but works well)  Cons: - Quite cramped inside - Not a huge amount of choice for food items other than chips/beef jerky/etc
