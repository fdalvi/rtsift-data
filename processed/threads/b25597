1 22 minutes. That's how long it took them to get me a double cheeseburger and fries. Re-goddamn-diculous. They weren't busy, and there were 3 guys there working. Me and my 2 friends were the only ones in the store. So I ask, WTF mate?
4 Clean, fast service and polite freindly staff. While waiting for my order (2 minutes), I thought this was one of the nicest b-king around. I can't explain the other reviewer's experience, but it was ironic that I was taking note that this place didn't feel like a typical B-King and then happened to peek at yelp and see the first review.
3 Why do I keep going here?  Burger King is good but their prices suck compared to their competitors.  I do enjoy their burgers more than alot other fast food places but their prices usually make me pass them by.
