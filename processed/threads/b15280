4 Love the products in this store! I always get coupons in the mail and the savings are awesome!! The employees are very helpful without bothering you and it is very clean.
1 Worst customer service.  Sunday 12/23/12 line to check out is 14 people deep and growing. Only 2 check puts open.   Really 2 days before Christmas OMG.  Some lady yelled why only 2 check outs they needed to open more.  After about 5-6 minutes the manager came out ouf hiding and opened another check out.  There are 4-5 check outs at this store 2 days before Christmas and they could barely open a 3rd check out. THIS IS HORRIBLE SERVICE AND THAT MANAGER SHOULD BE A SHAMED FOR HAVING TO BE CALLED OUT TO OPEN ANOTHER CHECK OUT SHE SHOULD HAVE JUST DONE THIS FROM THE BEGINNING.  She lacks the ability to observe what her customers needed and a customer had to speak up to move things along.
1 Horrible customer service! I called to ask if an item was in stock I got a hold on and then a yes and then they hung up. Not can we hold it at the register for you? When I arrived I got a yea it's over there in the corner on the bottom shelf. Not a sir let me show you where it is. The female cashier was nice and polite but couldn't save my opinion of the store or the lazy gentlemen that needs relearn his cust. service skills on the phone and in person. Will never be back to this location
