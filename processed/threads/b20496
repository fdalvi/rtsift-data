4 One day, I will treat myself and get a dress made here. I went in the other day to have a look, thinking I could wangle one out of my parents for my rapidly-approaching Graduation Ball, and I honestly think I'd rather be in here than in Willy Wonka's factory.   Everything. Is. Absolutely. Beautiful.  And expensive, which is the main reason why I wasn't straight on the phone home (I'm going to build up to it slowly), but you could tell that every single thing in there was so well made, and the fabrics used were all absolutely gorgeous.  The shop isn't huge, and the opening hours don't seem to be that regular, so I'd definitely phone for an appointment if you're wanting something made for you or even to have a look around their collection in-store. Their dresses make such a nice change from the boring, mass-produced ones you find in most department stores, where there are only one or two designs but just made in 30 different colours, but at the same time they're not so quirky that you'd tire of them too soon.  One day...
3 What a cute, quirky wee store. What it lacks in presentation it makes up for in off-the-wall, one-of-a-kind style.  All the clothing here is, I believe, hand-made by the owner. She uses old items, so vintage clothes sometimes, and sometimes fresh materials to fashion dresses, bodices and skirts.  It's certainly not somewhere you'd come for a regular Mon - Fri outfit, or even for a normal "night on the town" going out dress.  Rather, if you have a prom, a ball, and have the flair, confidence and finesse to pull of a one-off, spollight piece then this is your place. I'm pretty sure I saw photos of brides and bridesmaids on the walls too.  Pieces with tartan, satin, silk with funky cuts. It can all be tailor-altered to fit too. I'm pretty sure she will make a dress from scratch for you too.  Banish the idea of Coast, Warehouse or any other dullsville frocks from your mind. Psycho Moda does live up to its name. I'm just not sure if I *could* pull it off?!
