5 This joint is so clean and delicious! I love the service also. They're all young and cutesy. The yogurt is self served. There's so many delicious flavors. I work close by so I always make my trip to YO Fresco for some yumminess!
5 This place is an awesome way to cool down after a hot day walking around on the Las Vegas strip. The service is awesome, very friendly and helpful. They always keep it clean and the variety of flavors is great. You can try all of the ones available that day since it is self serve, and they don't mind samplers. The range of toppings is also great, too. I definitely recommend stopping by if you're around one day because it's quite cheap compared to other ice cream or dessert shops on the strip!
3 Located in the Venetian near the entrance to the guest elevators on the second floor.  It is a very small place that is a self serve yogurt place.  They serve a variety of flavors and have a limited selection of toppings.  The price is 55 cents per ounce.  Quite pricey compared to most other similar places.  Of course this is on the Strip so it should not come as a surprise that they are expensive.  As for the frozen yogurt, I can always find something I like.  If I am unsure about the taste, I will just ask to sample it.    Really, the only reason that I give this place just 3 stars overall is because of the high price.  Everything else about the place is worth either 4 or 5 stars.
