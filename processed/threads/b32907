5 I have had my eyebrows waxed, and was not pleased with the end result. The arch seemed weak, and the whole event was rushed in less than 5 minutes. The hunt for the perfect pair of eyebrows HAD BEGUN!  I'd seen the new Patel's Threading salon right next to Fresh and Easy for the past few weeks, and finally went in this afternoon. A very kind and gracious woman named Ana was there, and I asked her if threading on my brows could even be done, with a good end result. She said "Of COURSE! I can give you a beautiful arch you will be happy with!" I immediatly sat my butt in the chair, and let Ana work her magic.  The business is clean, and along the walls are posters of gorgeous-browed Indian actresses and models SO perfect, I wanted to swoon! I pointed to one, and told Ana THAT was going to be my brows, eventually, and she said it would be easily done- with a bit of work!  The experience itself was comfortable, and Ana did NOT rush a thing. Each brow was given at least 5-6 minutes of individual attention, as she whirred her spool of thread, plucking, shaping and cleaning them up. When she was finally finished, I gasped in delight! My eyebrows had the PERFECT graceful, ladylike arch I'd only dreamed of, till then. Apparently, I had one ingrown hair she had pulled out, and I began to bleed a tiny bit. She apologized so many times, I had to tell her that these things happen, and I was still very very pleased and happy with how she did my brows. She staunched the flow of blood quickly, and even with this teeny snag, I still found the money WELL-spent, and i'm so happy.  If you have thought about trying a eyebrow threading, see Ana at Patel's right away! She does a wonderful job, and was so pleasant and professional.   Oh, on a side-note, after my HORRIBLE experience at Angel's Touch Spa 2 days ago and Yelped about, I asked her if I could charge it, and also a $5 gratuity for her on my credit card, for my brows. She graciously said "Yes, of course, and thank you very much!" and was just a joy to encounter, after such a bad customer service at that Spa. THIS is how you treat your customers, and clients!  Ana is off on Sundays. They have a card for "Buy 4 Threading Sessions, get the 5th Free." The cost? ONLY $10! I'll be a loyal customer every 3 weeks now!
3 Bare minimum is the outlook of this establishment. There is little decoration and only one person was working when I walked in. For being a one woman operation, she has a loyal following customers who come in regularly.   I will admit that my eyebrows look nice and clean, but the process was not a pain free or comfortable journey. Multiple hairs were being removed in a hectic fashion. On several occasions the thread had broke. Roll, rip, and scrapping were common actions. Ana is meticulous and quick, but when I looked closer in the mirror, I had small lacerations under my brows.   I would come back if I knew there would not be a rush of people coming in. She had done a henna tattoo as I stepped in. One other person was before me and she had a full face threading to do after me. With that kind of pressure, I can understand why she was in a hurry to get me in and out.
5 This place is way better than Diva Beauty. Although, you may think that its a low class place...THINK AGAIN!  When I go to Diva Beauty I always leave there with my eyebrows being red & have a itchy/burning feeling. & it sucks! I left Patels with a clean face. NO itches/burning & luckily NO red. Go here & you'll be amazed (: I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT!
5 I came in here on a Sunday to get my eyebrows cleaned up. The wait was moderately long since there were about 4 or 5 people ahead of me and only two ladies doing the threading. Luckily, this place is in the plaza next to Fresh and Easy, so I walked around there for a bit to pass the time.  Overall, my eyebrows came out great and exactly the way I wanted them. My natural shape was precisely adhered to and the threading did not hurt as much as other places!   I also confirmed the fantastic job they did when I started getting compliments for my eyebrows!  This will be my regular place from now on since it is so close and the owners are so patient, nice, and very precise with their threading.
5 amazing anna strikes again!! seriously, i have been to plenty of other places, they start off good & then grow inconsistent...NOT anna!! she is always on!! such a perfectionist!! (which is great for another perfectionist) ;] & moms,...she also takes care of teen daughter & makes her brows look age appropriate.
1 I walked in looked around and this place has the bare minimum mostly looks like 1/2 occupied office in a strip mall. I decided to still give them a try the lady was working on someone and I had one more in front of me. She called the lady in front of me so I was happy I would be the next called another women walked in and was waiting then another women walked in the lady doing the threading said oh dont leave I know you are reg customer I will help you next I was shocked so I told the lady HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and we are leaving!!   We took our business to Shila Eyebrows Threading cheaper much cleaner and GREAT customer service!   I was looking to find a place where I would become a regular customer but Patel's decided to lose business.
5 Best threading place in Vegas! See Ana for sure!!!!! She's off on Sunday/Monday. She does my eyebrows perfectly and always knows how I like them.
5 When I lived in Henderson for a year, this was the only place I went to get my eyebrows threaded. I went every 2 weeks and Ana was always there to do a great job. She works fast and that's how I like it. Most other threading places would work slow and I learned that threading slowly irritated my skin and I ended up bleeding and swollen but when Ana did it, she threaded so fast that I couldn't even feel the pain from the constant pulling. She even took the time to shape my eyebrows and make sure that it was clean. Since I've moved to the OC I've been looking for other threading shops that could do it as well as Ana but had no luck whatsoever. Hopefully they will open one up here in the OC.
4 I go here everytime i need my eyebrows done. They were kinda messed up by me using tweezers and making one a little bit too thin. After going here and having the girls thread my eyebrows they fixed them and now they are straight and even again. Thanks alot!
5 Ana is the best! Only person that ever touches my eyebrows.
5 I've frequent the Fresh & Easy here and see Patel's Threading all the time but never have the time to stop in. I'm very glad that I did!  Ana, the main threader here is AMAZING! She's quick and minimized the pain and she was very nice! I'm telling all my friends to go here for their eyebrows.  And for $10--not a bad price at all. I will definitely be back!
