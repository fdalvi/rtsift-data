3 A gift shop with a difference.  The clue to the first difference is one word on the outside: weaponry.  To any man, this is going to spark interest.  They have a small range of different swords of varying sizes and types.  According to the DO NOT TOUCH signs, they were battle-ready and sharp (this just makes me want to touch them all the more, but I did manage to resist the temptation).  The quality of the items in this shop is a bit higher than in many of the others in the city, and there was also  a small range of teddy bears, which is something that you don't often see.  I was also welcomed into the shop by the owner, greeting me with a smile and a hello.  This is so rarely seen in shops these days, and it's good to see that they're interested in everyone that comes through the doors.  On the whole, I would recommend a visit to Neanie Scott if you're looking for a gift or trinket to give to a friend or relative.
3 Located on the Royal Mile, Neanie Scott is one of 50 squillion tourist tat shops where you can find yourself some Scottish souvenirs.   -weaponry -celtic crafts and jewellery -shortbread -Nessie ornaments -hip flasks -Scottish themed tea towels  ... and tartan as far as the eye can see!
