5 The staff r nice and its a quick way to earn $ the only thing i hate is getting stuck by a needle lol
4 This is the best plasma center in the valley. The only thing CSL has on Biomat is that they pay more. Biomat gives you cash, not debit cards, and their employees are wonderful people. Andrea, Matt, Shelia, Courtney, Bridgett and the entire staff are so friendly and always in a mood to converse. The center is clean and while you have some waiting to do, its not nearly as bad as CSL where it is all by appointment. When I used to go there, I remember having to wait 4 plus hours just to get back! This is a great center and recommend it over CSL anyday.
1 It's not quick never quick, in the beginning the staff are rude and don't care but after awhile of seeing your face they open up and even recognize your voice over the phone. The place is too small and they need more works, beds, and equipment.
