5 I have to say this pharmacy is fantastic. The owners and their employees are extremely professional, friendly and just all around caring. No one there judges you or treats you badly, like the big chain stores. They are quick , efficient and willing to go the extra mile for you. They will actually call and price check for you and order medincines for you. They do this because they want to feel better unlike the huge chains that make you feel that you are inconviniencing them.  I have switched to this pharmacy and I'm sticking with them.  When I walk in I don't have the shame, worry or fear I had with chains because they do care about you&your health. When you are not feeling well or must take maintenance medicines you don't need someone making you feel worse. This pharmacy, it's pharmacists and employees will leave you with a smile and a knowing that you will get better following your doctors & their advice!! Thank You Phoenix for making my visits awesome!
