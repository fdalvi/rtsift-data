5 I would say the staff (Laura specifically) are the best I have seen at any business in a long time, and especially in Las Vegas.  They were the cheapest out of all the storage facilities in the area. Super friendly and very clean. The building creaks when you walk, but I imagine its just the age of the building. I would definately use them again if I ever need storage.
1 On the road again, I am going on the road again to another storage facility on Sunset and Sandhill.  My friends locker getting robbed 3x is 3x to many.  There are no security cameras and it is easy to just walk in following someone else in and zap there goes your stuff.  My locker has not had this problem but then I have a tiny one. I am not waiting to be robbed.  There have been numerous robbery reports... nothing police can do,,,, and how many times do you think the insurance company will pay.
1 I have been at this storage unit for under a year and have been burglarized three times they raised my rates by almost thirty dollars after the first two after the the third time when the police where there the officer told me that they tried to talk to the owner but he refused to spend the money to upgrade the security on the property I spoke to the district manager and all he said was we are not liable. When I asked him why they won't install security cameras he told me that all it would do is get a picture of someone they don't know and would not help with anything. This place is horrible and I was treated horrible
1 Do not rent from this storage space! I have been burglarized three times in under a year. There is no security cameras no alarms the thieves come in and take what they want whenever they want . The management just does not care because they claim that they are not liable. If you intend on keeping your hard earned property do not rent from this place!
