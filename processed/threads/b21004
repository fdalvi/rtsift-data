4 With all its dusty, well thumbed books displayed lovingly in the window, the Book Exchange stands out in this particular part of Leith (because it's not a tacky bargain store, hurrah!)  I am enraptured by the gorgeous, old fashioned tiling on the shop fronting, but am equally impressed with the stock. Selling a range or used books, I was under the impression when I visited that stock is unpredictable in here - but that keeps it interesting. They had a wide mix of books which seems to be expanded regularly, so you need to keep going back!  Because it was so quiet when I visited, I was a bit too timid to ask if it is a bonafide book exchange. From what I could see they specialise in selling books, but due to the name I'm sure they may actually allow you to take used novels in to replace them with some of their existing stock. The owner was pretty friendly, so next time I'm in I'll be sure to ask and write an update for y'all. There's a few novels I read at uni which were (and I say this diplomatically) pants. So I would quite like to get rid of them and find an exciting old book in here, please. Watch this space.
4 I, like Marj, am still not sure as to whether this place will accept books as payment on other books (they dont exactly make it clear)- but this was just because I stumbled into this place very much by mistake and I didnt have a boom to test the theory with.  Other than that though, I realised that I actually quite like this place. It's full of every sort of book you could possibly imagine - a huge range of modern, old, classic and rare books seem to fill every noom and cranny. But be warned, i didnt think this was the cheapest of book store I had ever been in, and while I would more than happily pay the asking price for one of those rare books, I'm feeling a bit miffed at the price of some of the less collectable books on offor.
3 I'll start with the bad and then I'll move onto the good, because there is one thing about this shop that makes it very frustrating.  This is the fact that its owners have never decided to organise the books and put them in categories on bookshelves.  As it is you have to trawl through massive piles of books.  Now it would only take a week to sort out these books and I'll settle for just categorising, but alphabetical listings would be ideal.  As it is you'll find it hard to find what you want and the result is that you are unlikely to buy anything from here.  The good is that if you buy a book and if you no longer want it you'll be able to return it for half the price you paid for it.  However, don't expect to sell all your books here as they're not selling enough and the stocks pilling up so you're unlikely to find a willing buyer.  The books themselves are reasonably priced - the problem is finding them.
4 This refreshingly down to earth bookshop makes no claims to being highbrow, and is instead piled high with all manner of well-thumbed paperbacks, from an extensive selection of Mills and Boon to various special interest books from decades past.  The books seem to be arranged in no particular order, so that browsing may yield unexpected finds, while they also have a box full of hilarious comics about busty ladies duelling sea monsters with names like Jungle Girls and She-Cat.  And 'Book Exchange' is not an empty phrase - all books cost three pounds, but apparently if you return one, or bring in your own paperbacks in good condition, you get a £1.50 credit note to spend in the shop.
3 We all know, I have a soft spot for secondhand bookshops. Besides being cheap and cheerful, they usually offer you access to all kinds of weird and wonderful stories that you might never stumble across otherwise.   What distinguishes DL's Book Exchange from all the other secondhand shops scattered across the city, is that they offer customers the oppurtunity to swap or exchange books. All their hardbacks and paperbacks are priced at £3 but the owner guarantees that if you can't get past the first chapter of any, you're welcome to bring them back and get £1.50 off your next book.   Admittedly, you're unlikely to find any Pultizer Prize winners on the shelf but I did spot some cool writers and pulp noirs amidst the factual books and rom-coms.
