5 i drove up from the land of lincon to see my bestest band friends...the safes...play the king club.  they rocked the house.  and the king club is a great small venue. totally chill and awesome. check it out if you are madison.  just don't ever touch frankie o'malley's hair.
5 Ever since hosting iQ nights I've gotten to love the King Club. The owner and staff are incredibly nice and fun. Small venue provides for a great live music experience.
1 So, everyone that has ever taken a flight has seen that one other really attractive person waiting in line and hoped that they would end up sitting next to them by some random twist of fate.  I was the lucky man once. Her name was Ashley. She was a traveling salesperson working in the education field. She was a cute petite little blond with eyes that could light up the night.  On our second date, I took her to the king club. I never saw her again. I blame the bar. Clearly this situation is not my fault.
