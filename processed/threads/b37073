1 well, never heard about practice that when you call you can't see a doctor when you are sick.  this practice is all about false hopes, they treat establish patients horribly, and disrespectfuly. when you have people telling you that they are specialist and they can't see you, you better go and find another doctor or voice your opinions in this fourm. disgusting and manipulating practice that on purpose try to avoid seeing you when you are sick that you will come later again. i said it many times, medicine in las vegas is about making money, and doctors here are about putting more money in thier pockets than helping.
5 I have to say is that this was a great experience considering it's a doctors office. Obviously nobody likes to go to the doctor, and nobody likes to get poked and prodded especially by specialist. However this was a very clean and beautiful office. The staff is super friendly the doctor was amazing and essentially I got out very quickly. Instead of going right to surgery and cutting open my poor tongue that has a little cyst, he decides to take a little bit of time and watch it and observe it to make sure that it doesn't get bigger. No obviously he probably makes more money cutting the open but he errors on the side of what's best for me. That is a great doctor! Plus it was great to talk about how Obama and his healthcare plan is horrible. Love this place!
5 Very impressed with Dr. Gull. I recommend to see him if asked. Very professional, informative and friendly. Felt like a long time family doctor even though I just met him.
