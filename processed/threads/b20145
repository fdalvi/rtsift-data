4 A dated and naff old bar, but one with just enough downtrodden character to be strangely loveable, Henry J Beans has been here as long as I remember, and I hope it will outlive some of the more repugnant style bars that currently litter the city centre.  It is in all fairness, fairly shit across the board. Poor quality food and hopeless cocktails such as Sex on the Beach and Woo Woos are about as good as it gets, but you've still got to love the place.
3 Music loud enough to tap a foot to, but not to drown out conversation. Booths to cozy up to friends and fellas. Toilets down a loooong set of stairs. It's alright - cheezy cocktails abound - not much to write home about, really, but it works as an average stopoff in a city centre.
4 Sunday's are good fun.....not for everyone, but they host a Karaoke night on a Sunday night, which has just started again.  Good choice of songs, fun presenter and decent drinks offers on cocktails.
