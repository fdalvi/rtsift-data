3 The Blue Bean Coffee House is certainly one of the better places in Portobello to go for a quick bite to eat and a warm cup of coffee. With it being on the High Street, this place does not have the luxury of the peace and quiet that other coffee houses have which are located nearer the beach. However, when inside, you become less aware of the busy traffic.  The coffee house itself is quite small inside with a relaxing, laid back atmosphere. The coffee was not very expensive at all, and when I was looking around I found that this place offered a lot more than just your normal coffee. On top of a range of hot drinks, this place also offers small bites to eat including soup and small sandwiches.   When I was in, the coffee House was not full, but was certainly getting busier when I left during the mid afternoon.   A laid back atmosphere which is always nice when having a coffee.
3 This is a good place to get a well priced coffee, tea or hot chocolate, but I wouldn't come here for anything more than that as the prices can be a bit steep when it comes to food.  For a cappuccino, it only costs £1.75, which is very reasonable and tastes nice and frothy. But when I looked at the food menu, I thought that I would wait and go somewhere cheaper for my lunch. The cheapest sandwich that they do is £4, and although it has a lot of fresh ingredients in it, i would much prefer if they would do some basic sandwiches and charge these more modestly. They do a range of other food such as baked potatoes, soups and all day breakfasts. The shop itself is pretty small, but there is a couple of tables outside, which could be put to good use on a nice Summers day.
3 Why do people who know nothing about coffee insist on open coffee shops?! Blue bean? What kind of a crappy name is that? Ridiculous.  Sorry, lost it a bit there. This place is so average - it's like the love child of Tim Henman and Coldplay. In fact, if it was a child, it would have beige hair and would do quite well, not exceptionally, in school. Then it would attend a reasonable university and go and work for the civil service. Then die alone. Ahhhhh, allegory, my old friend.  I'm giving it three stars because there's nothing wrong with it, per se, there's just no reason to ever go there unless you're stuck in Portobello and desperate for a charcoaly coffee, like I was. Also, the food is way overpriced for what it is (sandwiches etc).
3 Average little place , not great not bad. Liked the steak pie. Little over priced but if you want a cup of Joe this place isn't bad.
