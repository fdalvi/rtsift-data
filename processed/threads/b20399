5 Calling all Angelina Ballerina fans!   For the youngest (or older) beginner to the more professional, this shop has a great selection of tutus, ballet and dancer shoes plus great and useful bags. Basically anything you need to hit the studio.   I came here in search for normal black ballet shoes and the lady was great in showing me how to fit them and sew the strap on (I am ballet- illiterate). I know that if I had found this shop 15 years ago (back in my short-lived ballet years) I would have been all over this shop. I actually saw 3 young girls running to this shop one day.   Apart from dance equipment and information about dance performances and classes around the City (not just for ballet mind you) it also is a great reference point for girlie gifts, bags and even umbrellas too.  I never took up ballet in the end but it certainly is a great shop dedicated to the art of dance.
5 I love ballet and everything associated with it. Edinburgh has a real lack of good dance stores, but luckily Dancia exists along with Dancewear on Rose Street.  This shop will take care of your every dance need in whatever form you need it in. They have everything a budding ballerina needs, including a good pointe shoe fitting service. They also stock Gaynor Minden pointe shoes which will mean nothing to anyone who is not a dedicated ballerina! The staff are extremely helpful which is very important in a dance shop and will point you in the direction of the right RAD uniform or type of shoe.  As with all good dance stores they have a good selection of gifts and girly things. So if your little dancer hasn't cleared out your bank balance enough with shoes and leotards, you can buy cute little trinkets and gifts for them.   Loves this shop!
