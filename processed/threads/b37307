5 Great service. Very welcoming and great tasting bagels.
1 Agh!  Ordered a bagel with cream cheese and thought it was the jalapenos that were funky til I realized the cream cheese was SOUR!!!! If they are not busy enough to sell plain cream cheese before it sours...
4 I found the staff very friendly and welcoming and my sandwich (Leonardo DaVeggie) and pickle delicious.  The iced tea was also very fresh.  I would not hesitate to go back and try something else.
3 I haven't seen one of these in quite a while.  They still have great fresh bagels.
4 Well, I've stopped by here dozens of times (lol) to pick up a baker's dozen bagels to take in for my office staff, and a few times for lunch bagels, etc.   Always friendly staff, always great bagles and cream cheeses.   I was really happy to see this place open up so close to my office as it was a quick stop on the way in at 6:45am to grab a quick treat for the team.     Unfortunately, I went to grab a dozen this morning and the location is closed.  Confirmed with another store that this store closed it's doors on 10/6/13.   I'm sad.
