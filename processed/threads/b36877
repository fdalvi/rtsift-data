5 What a place!!! I stopped in on a stroll and I was wowed! The lady there told me I could do the work myself or she would for a extra fee. This place is perfect for teenage party's . You can do so much. I plan on doing most my Christmas shopping here cause it make it easy and personal. Love the giant letters. Great place for those of us that need someone else to do the wood cutting but like to custom the ideas and add the personal touch. Prices are great too.   So worth your stop. And no I have no connection  to the store . Just hope this place is around forever. Great place for wedding and baby gifts too.   Love this place
5 My sorority had a crafting event here, and it was really fun! They have racks and racks of wooden, cut letters and even examples of already crafted art pieces on the top shelves.   The prices are a dollar or two above your regular craft stores, but the letters are a bit bigger and cut more accurately, so it's worth it.  The women that work there are very sweet, and extremely helpful. They have a small workspace in the back where you can hold very small crafting parties. The space has tables, glitter, paint, paint brushes, buckets, ribbon -- anything that you could need to make a really cute and personal piece of art. You can even ask them to make something custom for you! :)
5 Found this place in October. I stopped by one afternoon and was surprised to see all the creative options available. I purchased a few projects to work on and then went back for more. I can't wait to stop in again for the next holiday!!
