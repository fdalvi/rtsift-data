1 They get one star because of their ZERO customer service skills. Called my husband to tell him the car was ready and immediately hung up. Someone had already called him 15 minutes prior to that and he told them we were on our way..it wasn't even near closing time. The price was also different than what was quoted and the dude got an attitude and said it wasn't his deal and proceeded to take the receipt out of my husband's hand as he was still looking it. Avoid this place unless you like dealing with rude people. Whatever happened to the phrase "The customer is always right?"  GO TO DISCOUNT TIRE!
1 The guy who runs the front is very rude and has NO cust service. He's been there all 3 times I have gone (3 pre paid oil changes) and RUDE every time. Hey buddy, its not hard to smile. My oil change that includes a free tire rotation, didn't get the tires rotated. My wife curbed a wheel a few weeks prior and that wheel was definitely in the same location. I hope they put fresh oil in, but I'll never know and I'll never return to tire works.
1 LAS VEGAS SCAM ALERT!  I took my car here out of necessity as I hit a huge pothole in the road nearby and damaged my wheels.  The front counter guy, named John Reich, told me that my front wheel was cracked and that he would need to put the spare on.  I went ahead and let them do this.  My roommate picked me up and I went home and waited for the work to be done.  Hours later, I receive a call that the work is done.  I went to pick up my car and after paying $90, John comes in and tells me that they just realized that my back wheel was also cracked.  This was true, it was cracked, but they should have informed me of all damage before doing any work.  I ended up having to pay another $130 on top of the $90 to have my car towed home because I did not have a second spare.  If they would have given me a proper damage estimate, I could have avoided the $90 fee.    He also told me that my alternator is going bad and I need new spark plugs, and tries to sell me new wheels for my car.  The quote for the alternator and spark plugs that he gave me was ~$960.  I told him that I was going to file a claim with my insurance for the wheels and I was going to get a second opinion regarding the alternator and spark plugs. I knew that there was some work needed for my car as there was a slight shake when it idled, but I did not think it would equate to $960.  Long story short, after the insurance company gave me new wheels I took the car to an honest mechanic and had the idling problem fixed for $106!  It had nothing to do with the alternator or the spark plugs, it was merely a dirty throttle body.    Avoid this place at all costs!  They will only lie to you and try to get you to pay obscene amounts of money for things that you do not need.  Not to mention John is completely rude and has zero customer service skills.
3 I live down the street from this tire works. Kind of skeptical because of the other reviews. But decided to try anyways. I've gotten my oil changed there about 5x so far. I've never had an issue with them as of yet. They do take a while to do a simple oil change. They definitely seem busy in there (almost to busy to be pleasant). On the + side they have online coupons all the time. Sooooooo, if you don't mind waiting and dealing with a pushy customer service guy... Than i'd say try it out.
1 This is the worst place you can go to.  I have nothing against this particular staff, but their management is horrible.  We went there two days before a big Presidents Day sale.  We got an oil change, and got a set of new tires, balancing, etc.  The next day we saw the ad on TV for ALL TIRES buy one, get one free.  In contacting the store, we were told they could only give us more expensive tires with the sale price, but that could not have the sale price.  We were referred to the so called "Customer Service" person at the main office.  She is the rudest, nastiest person I have ever talked to and she sure doesn't provide any service.  After dealing with her, I will NEVER go to TireWorks again.  I will save my friends from being ripped off by telling them to avoid this company.  I have never  been treated like that and won't accept it, so goodbye TireWorks.  Unfortunately, there are always new people to rip off all the time so they'll probably stay in business.  Shame on  them. They don't deserve one star but it's the least I could choose.
5 I am not sure why everyone else complains about this place but everytime I have been there they have been great. I had a problem with my tire letting out air so when I went to get an oil change at the dealership they were going to charge me over $200 to fix the tire. I declined and swung by this place on my drive home and they took 5 min and fixed my tire for free.  No issues since. I started taking my car to get oil changes there since they were great my last time and only 2 min from my house and not 30 min like the dealership.   My blue tooth broke and I brought my car into Kia and they told me that wasn't their blue tooth and asked me if I bought my car used. I told them I bought it new off the lot in California and they said they didn't have parts but gave me a business card of someone that could help out.  I drove to Tire Works after 2 months of not having a blue tooth in my car and when I was getting my oil changed asked them to take a look at the blue tooth. The first thing they asked me was if my battery died when my blue tooth stopped working, I told them it did. They told me all they would need to do is re-install the blue tooth.  Later that day I have my oil change and blue tooth fixed. They fixed the blue tooth for free!!! They are always friendly, I would highly recommend this place of business. They are honest which is hard to find in car mechanics.
1 I hate mechanic places that try to take advantage of women. I went in for a simple oil change and they tried to get me to get new brakes, charge my battery for $150 and a power steering flush - my car isn't even 2 years old!  I had a discount peeler card, so my oil change was free; however, I will not be going back for the other 2 oil changes!
1 This place is horrible!!!  First, they said it would take an hour and it took 2 hours. Second, they inspected the break pads, and now my tire is making a rubbing sound. Probably need to rebalance the tires.   Damn, what a waste of time and I gotta go to California later in the morning. Gotta go back and have them fix this mess they caused!!!!!!  Don't go to this place please!
1 Terrible Service + Ripoff Prices + Wasted Time + Chauvinism = Tire Works  **Price Comparison for the SAME TIRES**        - Tire Works - $780         - Tire Works after "manager's special" and telling me they'd lose money on me - $646        - Discount Tires - $578 **Summary**        - Price - Their "manager's special" price is $70 more than the normal price at Discount Tires. Their regular pice is more than $200 more than Discount Tires.        - Service - They try to make you feel stupid and then take advantage of you. They get agitated and aggressive with you when you don't accept their over-priced quotes.        - SLOW - Also, I believe one of their tactics is to stall you there so you just give up and believe it's too much hassle to go to another place and start the long process over again.        - Warrenty Plans - They try to sell you overpriced warrenty plans by scaring you into telling you you'll need them.        - Overcharging Scam - I went there a year ago for an oil change and they told me I HAD to change my breaks or I'd be driving a death trap. They quoted me $1000. I took it elsewhere and they told me I had a while before I needed to change them. I got them done anyway for $200 there.        - Sexist - The owner made some pretty sexist comments about how dumb women. **Story**        - 3 years ago I didn't know better and bought 4 tires from Tire Works ($680) and a balancing warrantee($140). I got a flat and wanted to replace all 4 tires. Since my balancing warrantee was still good, I figured I could do two birds with one stone. I called for a quote and they told me $780. I told them I got an online quote from Discount Tires for $578. He told me to come in and they'll beat the price by $30. I came in and after 40 minutes of terrible customer service where they berated me about how it's impossible to get that low, their best price was $646. At one point the manager actually seemed like he was angry with me for even suggesting for them to match $578. Both quotes were for the EXACT SAME TIRES. Needless to say, I went to Discount Tires and got a much better experience. They did not try to upsell me, waste my time, or tell me I didn't know better about my car. On a side note, during the 40 minutes of wasted time, my girlfriend came to pick me up. While she was outside walking towards the entrance and before they knew I knew her, they made some inappropriate and sexist comments. I can only imagine how they treat female customers. **Recommendations**        - I don't even know if I could recommend this place to my worst enemy. If you have any sense at all, save yourself some grief and go to Discount Tires.
5 These guys are GREAT!! I came in with a flat tire in my trunk, It was close to 6:30 and the place was very busy... In less than an hour they had fixed my tire and put it back on.  They didnt even charge me!!  I dont know what all the complaints are about.. I would go back to these guys in a heartbeat!  I wish I would have got their names so I could give them each a shoutout but THANKS!!!
1 THE WORST!   I hate the fact that these guys are so close to my home but i cant ever go here because of their service, and the ridiculous prices.   - First time i came here i needed two tires mounted. Non stop i had the manager telling me over and over again those tires dont belong on those wheels. I didnt come for you to tell me about my tires so you can try and upsell me on something else because i bought tires online and had them shipped in cheaper than getting them from him. I came for you to mount and balance the tires.   - Second attempt just recent (within the last 2 months) i tried to get two rotors resurfaced. The phone call in was like this...."I have two rotors off the car i need resurfaced, how much do you charge for that service"... reply was uhhhhhhh be like uhhhhhhh $60. I said "good lord, i might as well buy new rotors" reply was then go do that...click. Rude as hell. I went to Pep Boys and had them do both for $30 total.   - Last attempt was just 10 minutes ago. I have a screw in my tire, discount tire fixes these FOR FREE! but its Sunday and they are closed so i tried damn Tire Works again out of convenience... i mean its a nail in the tire not a big deal. They quoted $35.... WUT! How can you even justify that? Put the tire back in the truck and came back home FuggitAboutTit!   There is NO way this place stays in business for the long haul. Look at the reviews people before going here... this many people cannot be wrong.
1 A complete rip off. I don't have anything new to add except it's no wonder the Nevada Attorney General was investigating them. Go somewhere else.
1 I bought the discounted oil changes from a guy who came door-to-door because they are right around the corner. First oil change was ok, took several hours because they wanted to call me and sell me brakes and didn't put it all back together, so I had to wait for that.  Second oil change my wife took her truck in, I wasn't there.  When I planned to go in for the third oil change, my wife told me to make sure I give them the wheel lock key so they can rotate the tires. Last time she was in, they called to ask her if they could break the wheel locks because she didn't leave them the key. She told them ok, and they charged her $25.  Only problem is...... WE HAVE NEVER HAD WHEEL LOCKS ON ANY OF OUR VEHICLES!!!!! She suspected something when she went to pick it up, because the counter guy was on the phone with another customer telling them the same thing about the wheel locks, but she didn't check with me.  So.... they will lie for $25, I will NEVER go back to Tire Works again.  Just sayin.....
1 Horrible horrible horrible customer service. I wouldn't recommend their services to my worst enemy. They are incompetent and lack knowledge.  I had an alignment done on the car after a major suspension overhaul and they tried to tell me my parts were worn out and couldn't get it into specs. The alignment they performed was tolerable for a few months and then I noticed my inner tires were wearing unevenly. Brought it back in since the alignment had a year warranty. I drop the car off and get a call 15 minutes later blaming me for replacing more suspension parts and my warranty was voided now. I went back into the store and politely told them I hadn't replaced anything after the initial alignment was performed. The tech continued to blame me and even called me a liar once. After a bit more uncomfortable arguing they agreed to finish the alignment. Once it was completed I had the guy at the register to never bring my car back to there store. I brushed that comment off and drove the car home with a new violent pull to the right. The tech mustve intentionally ruined they alignment due to little bitch syndrome. Had to bring my car to a friend and had the alignment fixed and within almost perfect specs. They had no reason to treat me like a criminal when I was clearly a paying customer! Screw these losers, I hope they lose their business and someone better moves in like discount tire.  Everyone that lives in Mtns Edge should steer clear of this crap tire shop. If you value your car, don't bring it here.
1 Wow 3 hours for new break pads... Unreal!! One guy working and 3 guys looking on talking shit and slowing the process down... it took 1 hour for them to tell me how much it would be even they even started working on the car... and I was there first at 7am when they opened... I would never go back...
1 Wow.   DO NOT BUY THE SERVICE warranty.   They will sell it to you and not honor it.  Had them tell me i only had a warranty on one tire (after buying tires from them for years) and then when I showed them the paperwork, they found another way to get out of the warranty.   The WORST.  Went to a different Tire Works in Henderson and they repaired a tire they should not have.   Mind you this is a mini-van filled with my wife and children.  There is NO customer service.
5 We have been going to tire works since we moved to Las Vegas in 2008. We are loyal customers because Kenan and his team always treat us very well. I definitely recommend this location to anyone because they have great service!
1 Tire works on Blue Diamond Road and Durango is terrible.   Don't go there.   They called me to come pick up my car and when I got there it was not ready. I sat and waited for an additional 45 minutes.  After being home for about 30 minites, oil leaked all over my driveway.  You want to laugh a little more?  I took it back the next day and the waiting room had two other people in who were making complaints about their oil changes and one guy said all four of his hub caps fell off while driving after tire works worked on his tires.
1 I have used this business for 2.5 years. They are always trying to get into your pocket and there is always additional work needed.  I was so fed up with them and their practices and always nickle and dimeing us too death,  this year we purchased 2 new vehicles so we have a warranty and don't need the service of a repair shop besides the servicing dealer!
5 These guys are awesome, they are very accommodating, we live next-door to the store and from time to time need things done as soon as possible and the mechanics and the management staff have been very friendly and accommodating. Wife and I just had a timing belt battery and a water pump done by Tireworks and we are very happy with the price and job done.John the manager he's always looking for a way to make it more affordable for anything that we need. Thank you Tireworks
4 These guys have done quite a bit of work on my 1992 Volvo and I'm pleased with the work performed.  Their price on full brakes and rotors was cheaper than a couple of other places I went to, and actually turned out to be even cheaper than what they originally quoted me by $100.  The other work I had done was for parts that I supplied and they installed them without a problem.  The only drawback is that this location is very busy and there is always a line in the waiting room to be served.  Also, there's usually mechanics standing around talking in the garage when they should be cleaning.
1 First off - I would rate ZERO stars, but it won't let me.  John (who works at this location) was actually very helpful for our situation - so I don't fault him -he is the only reason we still went back after our first incident (he would be better to find a new company).    HOWEVER - their corporate office is atrocious.  Paul - their district manager - came to our house to asses the damage to our driveway from a faulty oil filter that they installed.  They claim that the spots on our driveway are "not oil."  Well then Paul, if oil leaked on my driveway and there were no oil spots before, then what are they?  He was abrasive, rude, unapologetic, harsh, and sounded like he could care less about anything we had to say - and this was AFTER he was late to the appointment we had set.  He was more concerned with saving the company a few bucks here and there than fixing the situation which they created due to the oil filter spewing oil under our car as we drove home and then leaking on our driveway.  Of which - might I add - if I were Tire Works, I'd make my customer happy and then send the bill for the cleaning to the oil filter manufacturing company.  HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE - DO NOT GO TO TIRE WORKS - YOU WILL REGRET IT.  THIS IS NOT OUR FIRST GO-AROUND WITH THEM - DON'T DO IT!!!    Paul is going to get a bucket of soap and a broom and try to "clean it up," but after that, he suggested we go to the BBB if there is still an issue.  He wouldn't even discuss anything else (his words) because he was going to clean it to our dissatisfaction.  Jerk?  Yep.  When asked what time he would be at our home - his answer was "I can't give you a time since I have things to do.  If I told you 10 and showed up at 10:15 you'd be mad at me again" (yep, I would since you were late)  Professional?  Not even close.  And that's almost as high up the chain as you can go - you are warned.
5 Brought my car in with a screw in the tire. They patched it up and took care of me with no charge. Third time I have been there for TIRE problems and they always fixed it with no after problems. Thanks guys.
1 Brought my wife's car in with a flat tire to be patched and it immediately became clear they had no intention of helping me.  It was a Sunday and I couldn't find any other tire shops open.  Even though the tires had plenty of tread, I was told they couldn't patch it because the tire was too worn down and that I needed to purchase new tires (after incorrectly being told that the tires were proprietary and couldn't be taken off).  The car is a 2012 with low miles and I wasn't about to buy new tires from these guys so I put on a spare and waited until Monday to bring it to Sam's Club.  They fixed the tire without any hesitation and estimated the tires are good for another 18 months.  Avoid these guys if possible.
5 Love this place- they are so nice and helpful and fixed my breaklight for free. I recommend them to all my friends! !
5 A flat tire on a Sunday sucks. A flat tire on a Sunday preceeding Memorial Day when everything is closed, including the tire place where your warranty is honored, sucks even harder. Sooooo I took my car to the Tire Works up the street from my house, expecting to pay at least 20 bucks for a flat repair. It was FREE. And it was fixed within 20 minutes. I am still in shock. This makes my Sunday suck a lot less. Thank you Tire Works!
1 I purchased for new tires. Today I brought in one of them that went flat due to a screw. Counter guy said it would take at least two hours to repair, okay, I understand very busy! But never took my name, any information, even after I offered a few times. When I called to check on the tire, of course, he wasn't there. So it took a while to figure out which tire was mine, and it eventually was that "stray tire".  I brought the car with me that had the donut tire on it, but they said they were extremely busy and couldn't get to it for a while. They told me my tire was out in the shop and to pull up and I could pick it up.  And that's exactly what I had to do no one to help me put it in the car so got my own hands dirty again. I don't mind, but the service completely sucked all day. When I bought these tires I paid for the lifetime tire package and everything.    I have always bought my tires at Discount tire, not sure why I came here when I needed these, but it'll never happen again. Discount tire is always good and always bend over backwards for service, and I don't mind tipping the guys for free flat repair when you get good service. But II didn't leave a dollar this time.
5 I have used this location for my cars 3-4 times in the past 6 months since moving to Las Vegas.  The new manager and his team have provided excellent customer service.  They price matched on tires and were very competitive on oil changes when you use their coupons.  They even put nitrogen in my tires at no charge even though I did not buy them there.
1 I just bought 4 new tires. The tires are supposed to be quiet and ride well. No such luck for my Juke. So I looked over my bill when I got home and realized that they charged me more than $150 to install tires including shop supplies? Really? I usually shop around but due to a lack of time I agreed to purchase. It is my fault for not getting more details about charges and shopping around. Buy your tires elsewhere and save $70 to $100 in installation fees. They also tried really hard to sell me additional services. These people prey on women. Do yourself a favor and buy your tires elsewhere and make sure you are aware of average installation fees and prices for specific tires before signing on dotted line- OR you may be sorry just as I am. :(
1 If I could give them 0 stars I would.  I had a nail in my tire and Tire Works was the only place open on a Sunday to do the repairs.  The tech told me my tires were 4 years old and all 4 needed to be replaced because of dry rot (I have only had the car for 2 years).  I did not do what they recommended and waited until Monday to take the car to Discount tire on Blue Diamond and Valley View.  Discount tire told me I had at least another 20,000 miles on those tires and repaired the tire for free.  This is the 2nd time Tire Works has tried to get me to pay for something I didn't need.  They take advantage of people who are stuck because they are the only place open on Sundays.
