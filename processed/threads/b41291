5 Super cute shop! A must go for those in need of cute clothes and accessories who are trying to shop local.   The prices are very affordable. The tops I got were around $20 and the cute ring was $7.   Interestingly enough, they really do have something for everyone. My 62 year old other got some cute stuff along with my friend's 9 year old daughter. They even have plus sizes.   Cute items for all!
4 Went to pink buffalo for the opening and loved what I found!! Such a cute store with so much to choose from! So many different sizes, I'm a bigger girl so selection sometimes is minimal for me. This was a pleasant surprise.  I will definitely go back next time I need something to wear for sure! Great staff too! Love the place!! Thanks!
