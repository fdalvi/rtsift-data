5 Had lunch with execs. from Bank of America next door to this place. They had ordered the lunch delivered to them at BOA from everything-n-more cafe on the corner of the bldg. IT WAS FANTASTIC--I had a tuna salad sandwich that was one of the best I ever ate. So the following week I came back looking for the place, found it and had another terrific tuna salad sandwich. It is just west of the 101 at Ray Rd. in the big bldg. known as the Toyota Bldg. Turn in at the first driveway and it is on the corner. WHAT NICE PEOPLE! And they do a heckuva business there with a lot of food ordered as take out in a bag. You can email them to order your food. enmcafe@gmail.com or call them at 480-963-7572. You will probably need a menu so you need to go in at least once and get one. Catering is available also. I love this place and gave it a 5 star rating.  Bob Stephens
5 I eat here almost on a daily basis so I'm not sure why it has taken me this long to post something about it, but it's definitely time.  First off, the folks that work here are amazing -  accommodating, friendly.  Prices are great, and the menu has a wide enough variety that I still haven't gotten sick of the food.  Everything it seems is purchased fresh daily - the bread, croissants, produce, and also there are always homemade soups to choose from...haven't found one I don't like yet.  I am sure that most of their clientele comes from the two office buildings on this property, but if you are in the area and are looking for a quiet spot to grab a quick, tasty lunch...drop by.  The girls will take care of you with a smile.
