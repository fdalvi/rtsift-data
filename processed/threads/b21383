3 Chinese All you can eat buffet restaurant offers a variety of Asian dishes. Look for beef with broccoli, egg rolls, lo mein, orange chicken, shrimp, soup and more. Menu items vary.   I am sure this place will be rated down and that is too bad. For what it is, it is not all that bad. The ambiance is worse than bad. It looks like the owners have decided to open a thrift store in the lobby and it has spilled over into the dining room. The food is mediocre at best, but for $5.25 all you can eat it, it is a good value. The food tastes fine, typical of "Mall" Chinese food. Give it a shot. You may like it. Just don't expect much other than decent food and fairly good service.
3 I was driving along on Thomas today when I saw, "Lunch & Dinner, 50 Items, $5.25 All Day," painted on a window, so of course I slammed on the brakes!  The dirty sign outside said "Eastern Buffet", & I ran in through the front door.  It's a mid-sized place of about average style (Â¿) for this kind of place.  To make sure it's tacky enough, they have a little swap meet going at the edge of the dining room!  Speaking of tacky, all the tabletops were sticky.  They must have tried to clean them with lacquer thinner (whoops!), but now onto the food:  There were about 35 trays of food out (I don't count the sauces, croutons, etc.).  The fried chicken was greasy, but the fried rice wasn't.  The egg flower soup was terrific, & the salad items were all fresh & carefully sliced & laid out in the trays just so, as if they're really eager to please.  It wasn't lost on me.  The rest of the hot dishes were all good (at least), & the staff was nice.  I'll be going back!  3/31/09 Update:  I have been there several times now.  Some things that you should know:  *  Haven't encountered any tacky tables lately, but tacky swapmeet is still     in place!  (You wouldn't want to miss that!)  *  They have beer...  not sure if there's a full bar up front.  *  They don't open until 12:00 on Saturday & Sunday.  *  The prices on Saturday & Sunday are a little higher, but still very low     at under $6.  These are good days to go!
1 scary, unless you are homeless. stay away. disgusting, unsanitary, hole in the wall. manager is a crazy lady who yells at you and watches you to make sure you dont take any food home. tables sticky, bathroom is similar to ones you find at a truck stop, pealing paint and unkept.  carpet has holes in it and appears noone has cleaned it in a while.
1 I POSTED A PICTURE THAT SAYS YUMMY IN MY TUMMY...I LIED... If you are pretty much on your last 5.00 and you want to pack up a crazy huge to go box, maybe try it out...but other than that...TRUST YOUR GUT AND KEEP DRIVING!!!!!!
4 Consistently good food! That's what my wife said.
1 Horrible food, restaurant in poor condition, bad smell in the air when you walk in the door
3 = = = = = = CLOSED = = = = = =  After having enjoyed this nice 3-Star place which we regulars called "Eastern Buffet & Tacky Swapmeet" for over two years, I was sad to come up here today & find them gone.     :-(  For a similar place nearby I went to New China Buffet today, & enjoyed it.  They're at 2939 N 24th St.
