5 We have been using Jeff's services for more than 15 years. He has groomed dogs of all ages for us -- from rambunctious puppy all the way through old, blind and delicate -- and always, always does an excellent job. It's so convenient to have him come right to the door -- and his prices are better than most of the pet grooming salons near us.  He's totally dependable, professional and extremely good-humored. We have recommended him without hesitation to several friends and without fail, those who have used his services call us back to thank us. He is absolutely the best.
5 We used Petagree Mobile today for the first time and it was awesome! We have an extra large dog so we've never really liked taking him to the groomers knowing that he'd have to spend the day in a cage that's probably too small for him.   Instead of dealing with that, the Jeff from Petagree Mobile comes to you. The grooming, bathing, etc. is all done in Jeff's trailer, which has everything you would expect to find at a regular groomer. Jeff arrived on time and the whole process took about an hour. Our dog looks fantastic and he is not stressed out at all. The price was competitive; the convenience and service were definitely worth it.   We will be calling Jeff again in the future!
5 Jeff did a great job with my high strung Aussie mix today!  He was very patient with her, and she looks great!  It was her first time being groomed, and we will definitely call him back out.
