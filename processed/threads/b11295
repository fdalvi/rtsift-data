5 Lena has been my nail technician for over 5 years. I get compliments all the time on my nails. They never lift  and I  am rather tough on my nails being a bartender. Brian her husband does a great pedicure with a thorough foot massage that really takes the ache out of my bartender feet!  I can attest they are good at what they do. I'm not sure who the other reviewer went to in their shop as my experience with this shop couldn't be more different sp it must've been someone else. There are good and bad in every business the people I deal with are GOOD!
4 Looks can be deceiving! This was the best manicure and pedicure I have ever had. Walking in I was a little nervous by the look of the place.... But the professionalism and the quality of service was way above par.
