5 Love the place! The newest songs! Best gathering place in town!
3 Chinese mafia? I don't know... seems like the type of place.  I came here for a friend's bday thing. Plenty of space and lots of karaoke room. It's kinda an Asian divey place in my opinion, but if the mood fits, why the hell not indulge in that type of ambiance.  Staff seemed nice though so that's a plus. They were very accommodating to the party and knew how to have fun. Would I return? Ionno... I'd personally be too scared.
