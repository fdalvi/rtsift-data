5 Maria does beautiful work, from her sculpted nails to Pedicures. She caters the products she uses to your personal needs (ie lifting, oily nails beds etc.). She is hilarious and always a joy to be around. I highly recommend Maria and have sent many people to her over the years.  If you want a professional nail artist and someone you can talk to, she is your gal!
5 I have  been a client for at least 10 years.  She is the best!  Would not go anywhere else!
5 Today my daughter and I went to get our nails done with Maria she did a wonderful job. She's funny and thorough. I felt like I was at home. We will be back next month!!
