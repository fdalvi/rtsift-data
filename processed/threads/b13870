1 Prepaid for services, drove over an hour to my appointment and was told the doctor was over booked and I would have to reschedule.  The staff was unfriendly and took over 2 weeks to refund my money.
5 Loved my experience at Scottsdale Center for Sight!! They went above and beyond helping me feel comfortable with the LASIK procedure. Dr. Petelin did a wonderful job explaining everything to me and taking as much time as needed to answer questions. I had a very bad astigmatism, and Dr. Petelin told me in the initial appointment that I might have to undergo 2 procedures to get the best results. But he actually got such good results from the first procedure that I didn't have to do a second one! Highly recommended!
1 Very unhelpful and not friendly when inquiring about LASIK. I would encourage looking for a different eye center.
