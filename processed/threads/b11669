1 This place is the epitome of "dive".  It's not yucky or gross, just very much 1 star.  You get a bed and a mostly clean room (although who knows what kinds germs are on the comforter).  It's about 3 miles from the strip, in the middle of nowhere, and the price is cheap (usually about $70).  I've stayed there several times, as I'm in Vegas for family (not for the Strip).  So if budget accommodations are your thing, and you don't mind base basic and divey, this place is fine.
5 This is a $50 per night hotel 10 minutes from The Las Vegas Strip.   Hello?!  There was one other 3 year old review on Yelp about this hotel, I'm glad I disregarded it.  I had no complaints about the cleanliness or amenities of my room.   Free Wi-Fi, King Size Bed, Non-Smoking Room,  A/C, Cable, a Desk & Table and a Compact Refrigerator.   I'm sorry that I forgot to take a pic of the inside of the room.  The room was cleaned and towels re-stocked every day that I stayed there.  No hotel 'comforter' is to be trusted [in answer to the other review].  Yes, the place has been there a few years and from the outside doesn't look like much.  I remind you it cost $50 per night.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.    So you have to drive to find anything but Burger King or Subway to eat, chalk it up to how much you saved while you slept.
3 Exactly what it should be - a nice-ish value option off the Strip. They seem to have done some recent remodeling so it was even nicer than I was anticipating. There was a king bed (with pillow top mattress cover), desk, fridge and a patio table (indoors...) with chair.   Not very fancy, but you can't beat the price!
4 $70 for a Saturday night. It was basic, clean, and quiet. Not too far of a drive from the strip. For being the type of hotel it was, it was good. No complaints here. Free doughnuts in the AM!
