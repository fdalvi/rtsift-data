4 This is my earliest memory of Edinburgh. I came down here with my family to visit the city for the first time, and fell in love. These apprtments are brilliant, they are really modern with great colour schemes and are really comfortable and easy to live in. At that time, I was the youngest of a family of 5, so we were used to being crammed together but in these appartments you wouldn't notice. The doors are quite heavy, and we got a complaint from the neighbours for slamming them - which we weren't! - so be wary of the weight of them. It's a really nice place to stay in a nice part of the city, if you're a family looking for somewhere cheap I would thoroughly recommend this.
5 Haven't visited Edinburgh for a long time. I brought my family to visit this Summer. Stayed in London for couple days then we took a train up to Edinburgh. By the time we got there, it's 9pm. The hotel is very unique and you won't miss it. Very close to the train station. Just 5 mins taxi ride. Rooms are huge. We got an apartment! We have two bed rooms with 4 beds altogether. Two shower bathrooms. A living room and a huge kitchen. Great service. Walking distance to the Royal Mile. Highly recommended!
