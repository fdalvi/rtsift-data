5 Now called Snazzy Dogz  Kelly and her team of dog lovers are simply the best. They love their clients, listen to the parents.  You get exactly what kind of cut your thinking about.  I have a cocker spaniel who has sported everything from the traditional cut to an awesome Mohawk for that cool dog effect.  Best off  it's all inclusive, they don't track on fees for this and that.     We Support Family owned and operated businesses in Arizona.
5 The New Name of this place is Snazzy Dogz. The New Owner is Kelly King. She and her  staff are the most compassionate dog lovers I have ever met.  They make the dogz look amazing and then all the extra's! This place puts so much love and effort into each client and owner ;)   They have won over some clients by just having the heart to reach out at times needed. I would drive completely out of my way monthly and want everyone to know this place is worthy of all your pets needs!  Ask for Kelly she is the BEST!!!
5 Took my 2 Maltipoo's in yesterday.  They really did a great job with them.  Even put Pink Bows in Baileys hair.  Would definately recommend.
