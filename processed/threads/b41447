5 Amazing experience!  Life changing nerve damage repaired after a years visits!  Most relaxing face massage I have ever had! Jane is the very best!
5 I did a check in at this place before but since I'm still new to this whole Yelp stuff I didn't know I couldn't leave a star review when checking in. I don't want to repeat myself again but I did want to provide the Vegas community with the information I could not leave behind the first time.  This location is amazing and my experience with them was great! It has a very welcoming energy and relaxing beyond belief! I had said before that I work a lot and as a programmer I get some serious pains on the left side of my neck from sitting so much so I needed something to help this go away. Their skin care treatment was amazing and the session includes a massage that really relaxed my neck and took the stress and tightness away. I was able to get back to work the very same day and if I remember correctly I didn't care to stop working until very late in the morning. Great experience!   I also picked up this all natural deodorant that was lavender scented and really nice. It has a slight gritty substance that melts right under your arms during application and for as sweaty as I can get when I work out and play sports I must say it definitely did its job! I put away all my other deodorants as I had heard they are supposedly blended too much with some sort of metallic chemical or something like that. I like using all natural skin care products and this place has a great selection of them. I recommend anyone to go and check them out. They are friendly, the environment is inviting and clean and their selection of natural skin care products I thought was a great way to end the visit.
