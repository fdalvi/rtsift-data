4 As soon as you exit Haymarket Station, you will find AMT Coffee stand right outside. Perfect if you are rushing for the train and need to grab a quick coffee on the way and also great if you've just come off the train and need to grab a coffee or refreshment.  My usual purchase is a peach iced tea, which is £1.70 and is delicious and refreshing. For some reason, whenever I get off at Haymarket it always ends up being a sunny day do I need something cool and the iced tea is always perfect.  In addition to iced teas, they also have normal teas, herbal teas, coffees (all Fairtrade) and a good selection of cakes too.   For sunny days there's a small seating area where you can park yourself and watch the world go by, this is an excellent people watching spot as you can see people going to and fro at the train station.
2 AMT Coffee should kick-ass.   An English business run by three brothers, they started off with one shop in Oxford and have slowly expanded across the UK with a string of distinctive bronze kiosks. They were the first company to sell Fairtrade coffee and all their drinks are made with organic milk . At £1.45, £1.95 and £2.00 for espressos, cappuccinos and lattes, their prices are also significantly cheaper than you know who.  The problem is, the coffee. I've had half a dozen cups on seperate occasions and each one has tasted bad, bad, bad. I'm talking burnt, bitter and with no depth of flavour.
