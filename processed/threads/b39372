5 We love this place.  My two children started summer camp here. The teachers are fantastic, the programs and facility are top notch.  I am looking forward to signing up for classes in the fall.
5 WPA is awesome..we went to open gyms and Uldi and his wife were working with the kids, spotting and helping them.  I am trying to work a summer camp or classes into our schedules.
5 Great place!  New and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly!  So happy I found somewhere like this to take my children!!!
