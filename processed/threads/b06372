5 This place is awesome. I'm giving it 5 stars for their wonderful service and decently priced designer items.   They have a nice selection of designer shoes. Some new still in the box. As well as bags and jewelry.   The people who work there are so friendly and make you feel welcome. The owner is usually there and takes her time with helping you. She asked me what my size I was and found pieces that she thought would look nice on me. I was fixed on this one D&G coat but it was too big on me and she told me the truth. They don't force you to purchase things that don't look good on you. They want you to like what you buy. Whenever I have money to spend I come here and always find something great.
5 I agree with the other review. This place is awesome. The service is fantastic. They are not pushy at all, extremely helpful. They do tell you the truth if something doesn't look good. They even offered me a bottle of water while I was trying on clothes. The prices are really reasonable and often times, the price you pay is actually lower than on the tag because they mark down based on how long items have been there. Great quality items, great variety, and if you are looking for specific items, they keep a "wish list" for their customers and call you if anything like that comes in.
5 Amazing collection of Chanel, Versace, Cavalli, Lanvin, Dior, Jimmy Choo, Manolo Blahnik, and more. Large selection of shoes, handbags, accessories and clothes -- including evening gowns. Expert and profoundly gracious service -- I felt as if I were in a designer boutique! My new favorite consignment store!
2 Need a good laugh?  Go into Ritzy Rags, engage the owner in conversation and then plunk on her that you just love going to "junk" stores and pick up items (whatever? Gucci purses, Fendi scarves, Prada wallets, etc.), too. Better yet, tell her you shop Goodwill all the time.  She will fume so much that the frost starts to grow over the whole store.  It's a hoot!!!! OK stuff, tho.  Just who wants to pay $400 for an obviously dry cleaned more than a few times Escada sweater coat?  Too high for the quality.
4 Nice selection n very friendly.  Unfortunately the sandals I liked wasn't my size.  Will check back again. :-)
5 Pam is so creative and a great person! Her store is the best resale store in the Vegas valley. You can find numerous bargains for very high end clothing, handbags and a variety of beautiful items. Go shop, you will have fun and, who knows, you may find that hidden treasure!
4 This boutique is very interesting. It is small, smells like grandma's attic (not bad but noticeable) and has a few fun things that the others do not. I really can't be disappointed because vintage/consignment is hit or miss.   I did find some super stylish evening gowns, $98, fair price for a non-designer label. There were a few designer items that caught me eye, and the price was reasonable (Fendi, Dior) under $100. I will definitely try this place for my next gown or formal event before I drive to a department store or the strip.   The employees were nice. I will go back.
4 This is a boutique catered mostly to designer brands, which was what brought me here. Great selection of designer shoes, I saw a classic Chanel pair and a vintage looking Louboutin pair, amongst lots of Jimmy Choo and other designer shoes in great condition, some even come in original boxes! I went in originally for designer purses and was a little disappointed by the selection. But I will definitely check back for shoes.
5 I love Ritzy Rags! Unlike other places they are so helpful but not pushy.  They want things to look great on you and they tell the truth. They  are always getting new items in, so one trip is is not enough. It's so great I can get upscale items at a low price for holiday presents. My sisters love the presents I purchased for there birthdays , they still had tags on them brand new. I'm a super star in their eyes , but no one knows my secret. Love the owner, so friendly and hands on. Going after Thanksgiving  to finish up my shopping. So thankful for this store, love it! Oh it's Mikes wife Kelly
4 Tiny, but fully stocked with couture as far as the eyes can see. Floor to ceiling nothing but designers labels, well kept, clean and fair prices. The owner is a doll, super super sweet, I love everything about this store. Located in a run down strip mall, it is still well worth the stop if you are looking for something unique while in Vegas!
