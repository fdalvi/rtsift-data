5 Pulled pork sandwich and spicy beans were amazing!
5 This place is good.  I have been here many times and I will continue to come back.  The food is great, the staff is very friendly.  I have tried all the food on the menu and all of it tastes great.
4 Yes, Tasty, Filling and just a little bit different for BBQ - Ryno's fit the bill for a savory and satisfying meal.   Green Chili cream corn is a little sweet, a little spicy; but just right.  Brisket was quite good too, two BBQ sauces: spicy and regular are there if you need them.  Try it, I think you'll agree, it is yummy! A Solid 4 stars for service, cleanliness, taste, and value.
5 Food was Awesome!!! Had the brisket, wifey had the chicken. Both were yummy.... The cream corn was great too, a little too hot for her, but I loved it! Highly recommend. Staff was friendly, place was clean. Even the owner came out and talked to us.... Support your local businesses!!!!
1 The only positive I can give is that the water was cold.  Family platter was brought out and server seemed shocked that I wanted plates for us to eat off of.  Brisket was soggy and gray....seems like they had it resting in a warm water bath.  Pulled pork was lukewarm at best and chicken was pink and not fully cooked.  Dinner rolls were cold stale and hard.  All in all a very poor experience
2 So....I love brisket, not so much BBQ, pretty much just brisket.  So much so, that I've become a brisket snob of sorts.  I'm sure there are others out there with a more refined palette than my own, but I am definitely sure of what I think a good brisket should be...  That said...I attended the Chandler BBQ festival a few weeks back, with the mission of finding a brisket that exceeds Famous Dave's.  You see, Dave's brisket is the current standard for me, as it is consistently better than many of the independent restaurants in the east valley.  So, at the BBQ festival...I went from vendor to vendor, sampling the brisket offerings from all the vendors. Two stood out and Ryno's was one of those two.  The brisket was tender, divided easily, great flavor, with a mildly sweet finish. (They use fruit and nut based woods,which you can taste in the flavors and finishes.)  The brisket I had that day was outstanding.  "Oustanding!"   The guys manning the booth even took the time to describe for me their process, the wood they used, etc.  Great brisket and excellent customer service?  I was sure that we had a contender here, worthy of unseating Dave.  So yesterday we were out in the area near Ryno's, and I decided that we would get dinner there.  I was ready to filled with brisket happiness.  What a let down.  The brisket was not hot when served, but was reasonably warm.  It did not divide easily, but had to be separated with force. The flavor was acceptable, but I was so disappointed by the toughness that it spoiled any other satisfaction I might have had.  That said, the beans were good and creamed corn was excellent.  We didn't even finish the brisket.    As we were walking towards our car, I told my wife how disappointed I was.  She suggested I go tell them. So I walked back in...the young man behind the counter greeted me in a lukewarm manner (sidenote:  teach your counter staff to be as engaging as your cooks were during the BBQ festival!) I asked to talk to whomever was cooking that evening.  A lady came out from the back and I explained for her what I had experienced, and how disappointed I was in the brisket I had just eaten, when compared to their brisket at the festival.  She was very nice, and mentioned that someone had done something during the cooking process (they evidently pulled the brisket off to load some other meat, and then put it back on.)  I was glad that she was open about this, but that was as far as it went.  There was no offer to reduce the bill, or refund, or even a discount on a future meal.  I'll give Ryno's one more chance, and then it's back to Dave's if they fail again.
5 I have been to Ryno's quite often. Partially because I love their food, and partially because I have a pregnant wife who has been craving BBQ!   I especially wanted to commend Ryno's for their efforts Thursday April 25th. There was an event sponsored by Modern Woodmen of America that fed over 300 people in 3 hours in their San Tan location. Ryno's nearly ran out of all food in the chaos, but was able to feed everyone with minimal complaints by the time all was said and done.  Great job guys!
5 Best BBQ west of Texas. EVERYTHING TOP NOTCH AND DEELISH!!! My twin sister also agrees (maybe because we are twins). Really, good, you won't be disappointed!
4 We have been to Rynos several times. We are fans of the Ribs, Chicken and the Brisket and the yummy mac n cheese! The meat is always juicy and tasty. The rub on the ribs and the chicken can be a bit spicy at times so may not be ok for kids unless you peel off the skin. The Mac N Cheese is unique compared to most traditional mac.. Its super yummy though! We usually order the multi meat family style platter, not sure what its called.  This place could have a bigger menu and  I wish they offered white meat chicken also. I also wish the menu specified that certain items are only avail certain day of the week, like the wings. The staff is average, no overly friendly.. Service varies from visit to visit. The restaurant is usually cooler inside so bring a jacket, I dont think they use the heat ever.  Very casual setting, order at the counter style. I wish they had more options for kids!
1 Way too spicy! Very dry...should've known before I walked in to not to go in...when Nobody was in restaurant..and every other place to eat was busy...on the positive EXCELLENT customer service!!!!
3 This place was pretty decent.   The meat on their pulled pork was good quality.  It wasn't fatty at all.   The sauce was ok, I've had better, but I've definitely had worse.  The spicy sauce to me wasn't spicy at all, and it didn't really have much flavor, it was just smokey.   Would be nice if they had a sweet and spicy sauce option.  Prices are fair.  They need to advertise!   I didn't even know this place existed and it's been around a year, or just put a sign up.    All they have is this corner sign with an arrow.   Compared to what's in the area I would say this place is pretty good.  I would go here over Toms which is another local spot.
4 Just went back for the second time and loved it.  Had the rib tips and creamed corn.  The rib tips was a generous portion, tender with the right amount of spice and smoke.  Creamed corn was incredibly rich tempered by green chilies.  My guest had the chicken with mac and cheese.  The chicken was pretty moist for BBQ.  Will go again and beats the tar out of any of the chains.
1 I went in...no one out front. Stood at the counter for 6 mins. The girl behind their wooden swing doors had to of seen me. After 7 mins, I walked out. Will not return.   Their soda machine had duct tape over all the choices. Must not do inventory checks.
4 Awesome place.  Buddies and I almost wanted to stay and hangout inside just so the smell would follow us around. The prices are pretty good for food that awesome.  Did I mention the food is great?   The kid at the front counter was a little un-engaged with us, and was more worried about his cell phone than explaining the TaxDay deal works customers.     The sauces we not bad. I enjoyed them and I love having enough at the table so I can drench my meat in sauce.  Great Job guys.
5 All around great food and service. Staff is very friendly and keeps the customer in mind. If you are looking for a great BBQ then this place is a must try. It's hard to find good pulled pork and good BBQ sauce and Rynos does it well. All the sides I have had are really good especially the southwest style cream corn and the sweet beans.
4 If you are looking for a local BBQ and don't want to wait then Ryno's is for you.   They may not have the best BBQ but the service is normally pretty quick.   The mac n cheese is pretty good.   It can be kind of smoky inside. Staff could be a little more professional but it is quick service and decent food.  You won't leave hungry.
3 Well, I was standing in line behind an older woman, who was trying to decide what to get. Then her 3 friends showed up, joined her (cut in front of me) and one of them starting grilling the poor kid behind the counter about how she knows good BBQ since she's from Kansas City. One of the older women turned to me after about 5 minutes and said "we just cut you, huh?" It's not Rynos fault, I just thought it was interesting no one said anything from the staff. I didn't take into account on my rating.   I got the pulled pork, brisket, Mac and Cheese and Sweet Beans.   The meat comes dry... Meaning no sauce. The meat itself was not dry and extremely tasty and smokey. The sauces were both good, and I found myself wanting more hot sauce (I got it to go). Overall, the meat wasn't bad. My only take away was that it's pulled brisket....They don't advertise that. I wanted a cut of brisket when I went out on my BBQ lunch adventure so I was a little disappointed there. The meat was priced fairly.  I read that the Mac and Cheese was pretty good, so I got two small sides. Let me tell you, they are SMALL! $2.50 for a sample sized side?! I can get bigger samples at Cold Stone. That was my first knock.  The Mac and Cheese is great! And I think they gave me their spicy beans instead of sweet, because my mouth is still on fire.  While I was waiting for my food, I read that the soda machines had duct tape on them, which they didn't... But The Iced Tea machine had two band aids in a X on one of the flavors. Yikes. I don't want to see band aids while I'm about to scarf down food.  Overall, the food was good. I'll be back again for the meat, but no sides.
