5 Okay this guy is awesome and I plan on asking him to do my wedding. I have used Jeremiah for years and I have never been disappointed. From that birthday gift to just something to say I care. he can whip up something in a heart beat and will work with your budget too.
5 This floral shop goes beyond what you might expect.  Bigger, better and less expensive.  Highly recommend!
5 I use Jeremiah on a pretty regular basis for deliveries to clients, but I recently sent a bouquet to a friend and she was kind enough to send me a picture.  Perfection!  I love what he did with my pretty vague request. Green, purple and fuchsia colors became the perfect for her arrangement!  They are always super kind on the phone and I've never heard of an arrangement going astray. I was shocked at what she received for what I spent, but in a good way.
