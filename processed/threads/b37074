5 I have lived in countless places and thus have experienced every type of auto repair shop there is. Wilhelm is hands down the best one out there! Their staff is honest with you, whatever your car needs may be, they will be looking out for YOUR best interests, not their wallets. And I can not say enough about the amazing quality of their work! If you're looking for a auto repair shop look no further.
1 Ac broke in my car. I went to wilhelm because reviews were good on yelp. 1800 to replace compressor,condenser, etc parts. I went to an honest shop,a/c needed an O RING, 200$. 3 months later ac working great! Rick was tech who said compressor was shot,Joe Daro advisor. I'll never go there again.
