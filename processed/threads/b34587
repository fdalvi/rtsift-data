1 Ugh!  I bought a Groupon for this business and was waiting for the perfect time to use it.  Called, no answer, left a message.... called a week later, the same... I left a total of five messages for these people (this person?) and not one call was returned.  I had to go through Groupon to get my money refunded since they're either out of business or had no intention of calling me back (maybe I shouldn't have mentioned that I had a Groupon?  I don't know).  In any case, this review is obviously regarding the customer service since I couldn't manage to persuade them to accept me as a customer!
1 Tried to redeem a Living Social voucher one month before expiration. She would not schedule an appointment because she said she had no more openings until after the voucher expired. I thought it was shockingly unethical that she wouldn't honor it but she just exchanged nasty text messages. Poor woman is very angry. I sure wouldn't want someone like that touching me.
1 I called to book my appt and was rudely informed that I waited too long, was not going to be able to get an appt before the expiration date, and that she would not honor my deal. Bad business!!! I called with plenty of time. I could not believe how rude Janina's texts were. I am contacting Living Social. Fingers crossed they refund me.
