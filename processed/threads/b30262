5 This is my new favorite Madison hotel! It was a little hard for me to get to, because my GPS isn't the smartest, but Google maps found it okay. The price was as good as any other hotel, like Super 8 or Baymont, but the hotel was very nice, nicer than the Super 8 for sure.  Super clean, and the room was great. Very nicely furnished, and comfortable. The bed was perfect. And the bathroom was great--no gross bathtub, just a nice modern shower. I would definitely recommend this place, and will be staying here again.
4 This hotel is a great value!  Very clean, nice staff, very accommodating, and they keep their pool area open all night!
3 3.5 Stars- perfect for 1 night passing through on a cross country road trip  Pro's  Pet Friendly- minimal pet fees   Excellent pricing Clean, modern furnishings Clean updated bathroom Good mattress, linens and pillows Breakfast- we were in a rush and just grabbed a couple things, we didn't have a chance to sit down and dine.  Con's  I can't really seem to remember many con's- we were pleased with our stay. We arrived around midnight and checked out by 10am the next morning, so we didn't do much else than bring in our luggage and go to bed.   Overall, pleased with this hotel and would stay here again if ever in the area. The room was clean and we were very happy. Our room was a tad small, but it was fine.
