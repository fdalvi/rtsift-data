5 Absolutely thorough and incredible service very friendly staff.  They went out of their way to make sure my prescription was perfect
5 This office was covered by my insurance and I found a great review on Yelp that helped.  I gave it a try and was very happy. Great customer service by the friendly staff and Dr. Tamara Guiterrez was very attentive to my concerns and thorough during the exam.
5 I had a horrible experience at my last eye doctor and I live and work in the area that Elite Eye Care is located so I thought I'd stop in and give them a try.  The office was very nice inside and comfortable and every single person on that staff greeted me, was extremely nice and very helpful.  I saw the doctor right away, got all my questions answered by her and dealt with the rest of the staff to get me checked out and on my way.  When I went back in to pick up my glasses, it was very efficient and was extremely caught off guard by their "designer" touches, they packing for their glasses, their complimentary care kit, wow is all I can say.  I will refer every single person I know to them and good luck to Elite Eye Care and thanks for taking care of me so well!
5 I'm not exactly sure what constitutes a "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" experience at an eye doctor, but Elite Eye Care gets my seal of approval.  I've only been to two eye care shops in my life. For the most part, the choice has come down to location. Elite Eye Care just happens to be close to where I live now. Luckily for me, they also happen to be very friendly and great at what they do. The lobby area is nice with a good selection of designer frames. I can be pretty indecisive when it comes to picking a new pair, but the staff has always been very patient and helpful.  As for the eye exam, the only thing I can say against them is that the retina photo exam thingy costs extra. At my previous doctor, that was included. It's not a big deal. You can opt out and have Dr Gutierrez inspect your retinas manually. I'll be honest. This ain't a bad thing. The doctor is kinda hot! Yeah I said it.  Oh and one more thing. It's right next to Soyo! That alone could be worth five stars.
5 The office staff is very friendly and always helpful.  I've had to go in a few too many times for my liking because of infections and the staff remembers my name when I walk in.  That is always very comforting, knowing that I am not just a number/patient.  They have a great selection of frames and the decor is awesome in there!  I highly suggest you visit them for your eye care needs.  Even if you don't need an exam, the frame selection rivals that of the high-end stores in the mall and the cost is very competitive.
4 I found them on my insurances website and decided to take my son there. It is conveniently located on Robindale and Rainbow and is only a few minutes away from our home. When you walk into the office, you are walking into a frames showroom. They have both sides of the lobby and a little island with frames inside the cases. They have a good selection of glasses and depending on what kind of lens you need, they might have them in stock.  The first part of the appointment was her assistance conducting a eye test with my son. She used three different machines to check his vision and the other was to check the pressure on his eye. The last test was to take a picture of the back of his eye. This was not covered by my insurance and we had to pay $35 for this test. I guess she could have done it manually but thought I have them take a pic of his eye instead. I am glad that they did cause she was able to show me what was going on and now we have to see a specialist for a second opinion. OK so the visit with Dr. Gutierrez. She is a very pleasant doctor. She new her stuff and took the time to break things down so that I could understand what was going on with my sons eye. She was very thorough and she is the one who recommended that we get a second opinion on her findings.  She gets my seal of approval and I recommend her to anyone looking for a new eye doctor.
5 Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (20 of 365). I have a lot of catching up to do!  For the past 2 years I have went to Elite Eye Care for my eye appointments and for new frames and sunglasses.  They definitely take care of you in this office.  The doctor really takes her time to examine your eyes and ensure she gives you the correct prescription.  Afterwards, the ladies in the office are just as attentive in selecting the right frames for your face.  The last time I was there it took me an hour and a half to decide and the ladies were so patient with me because they also wanted to make sure I was comfortable in the lenses I was going to purchase.  They even helped for another half hour to decide on some new sunglasses.  It was a great and comforting experience because they were so helpful.  After a short week, I received my glasses and they gave me a complimentary cleaning spray, cloth, and even a piece of chocolate.  Now that is quality customer service with an added pleasant surprise!  I bent my sunglasses after having them for only a couple of weeks; I brought it in and they put them back in shape in less than a couple of minutes.  I will be back every year!  Thank you Elite Eye Care!
1 My husband first went to Elite Eye Care 2 years ago, it took 7 weeks and 4 different try's to get his glasses right.  We thought well may be this was just a one time issue. We made the mistake of going again this spring - 7 weeks to get his sunglasses done, they even broke the frames and had to replace them which added more time to getting them! The "rush" on his daily glasses took 5 weeks! We asked about compensation and the answer was "oh I'm sorry but we cannot give you a discount", just the apology! We will NEVER be back!!
5 Most personal appointments (ie: glasses, physicals, prescriptions) can be quite the hassle: you have to take time off work, drive across town, wait to be seen, all for a product that you can't go without.  It's a good thing Elite Eye Care is open on Saturdays, located near home, has efficient staff, and provides great customer service.  The staff here is a huge change from other offices; the doctors have been more than willing to spend some extra time with me answering all my questions.  The front office staff is also super awesome in helping you choose a new pair of glasses.  I told them that I felt like I was buying a car, having spent quite a while trying on new glasses to figure out exactly what I wanted.  No worries though, they were there the whole time giving me their opinion and calling more staff up front if I wanted more than a second or third (or fourth...) opinion.  After selecting everything I need, I've always been given an estimate of 7-10 days until pickup; I've always been able to pick up my items in 5-6 days.  Having bought two pairs of glasses and several sets of contact lenses here, I've always had excellent experiences.  The staff is awesome, their products are awesome, and you don't actually have to be Elite to go here.
5 My eye needs have been met here at elite eye care for the last two years.. The staff are friendly and are receptive to appointments via email or phone. The doctor is professional and informative. They even send you a survey the next day for feedback on their service, and I like that.   They are a little aggressive on selling the glasses if your insurance covers it but hey, it's a business. When my prescription  changes drastically, I usually just have them update the lenses on my existing glasses, as I only wear my glasses driving at night.  Also once, I brought all my glasses and sunglasses in and they made sure they were straight and aligned to my face.
4 As a new patient, I am pretty impressed with this place so far. I never had to wait; I was always taken right away. The staff was very professional and friendly & the place is real nice. They even offered cookies on a tray. That was a nice touch.
1 **Summary**        - Incompetent staff - Half of them don't know the obfuscated procedures the other half enforce to make it difficult on the customer and waste time.        - Availability - They randomly have no doctor in for a day. How are you going to have an optometrist location without a doctor?        - Pressure - They try to push the brand of contacts that will give them their commission and make it terribly difficult for you to get the one you want.        - Price - With insurance, their fitting prices are about $20 more than their competitors. **Story**  One Saturday, my usual optometrist was booked solid and I was in great need of new contacts, so I gave Elite Eye Care a try. Big mistake. I came in looking for a contact lense prescription for my current brand and a glasses prescription in case I wanted to get new glasses later. After taking the exam, they "forgot" to write me a glasses prescription. I mentioned it and they apologized. Tricky tricky.  The next week I'm trying to buy my contact lenses at Sam's Club and they told me the contact lense prescription was for Acuvue 2 and not my current brand. Well played Elite Eye Care. Well played. I call Elite Eye Care up to tell them I wanted my current brand and they told me they just have to fax over a release form for me to sign and send back. I did that and due to their slow response time, it took an hour. Guess what, they sent over the exact same Acuvue 2 prescription even though I specifically told them that was the problem. I called them again and they changed their story. They now told me I have to come in and get "refitted." Unfortunately, because they wasted an hour, they were closing and I couldn't do it that day. I told them I'd come in next Saturday, and they told me it'd be fine since the "refitting" would only take a second.  Next Saturday, I come in and they tell me there's no doctor in. At this point the trial lenses they gave me is past due, so I gave in and bought Acuvue 2. Unfortunately, I let them win.  **Recommendations**        - I would definitely not recommend this place unless frustration and inconvenience brings you joy.
2 Staff is the rudest I have ever witnessed, in what is supposed to be a professional office. We basically had to keep telling then each time we wanted to try on different frame because they were busy chatting with one another. Then when it was finally time to leave something told me to turn around and they were talking about us. This display of unprofessionalism was on more than one occasion. Them being very unaccommodating with emergency contact needs was the icing on the cake.
5 Saw Dr. Gonzalez. First time having her do my exam. I had a great experience. She was super friendly & professional. Everything went efficiently & pretty swiftly. I really liked my experience. Whole staff was great too. Going to take my son in next Friday for his exam. I HIGHLY recommend this place. Very nice facility & eye wear shop.
5 So my goal in life is to become an optometrist, so you could say that I have an eye for these kind of offices. Clever I know.   Okay hold your applause now.  Anyway, my insurance was no longer accepted by old office so I was forced to find another optometrist. Luckily my brother found an office before I did and I was fortunate enough to set up an appointment within that week I called. My appointment was pretty impressive, the staff and Dr. Gutierrez were all super helpful, nice and informative. Being a pre-optometry person I had plenty of questions that all were answered.    With my insurance (VSP), the pricing seemed to turn out all pretty fair and in the ballpark I was expecting. I ordered glasses which they said would take 7-10 days, but my glasses arrived by the end of the week anyway. Great services, they always greet me with a smile and call me by name like they somehow remembered me, even though I totally would have understand if they didn't.  I even went in to have my glasses adjusted and they did so right on the spot with a minimal wait. Great, great overall service and I have been recommending them to everyone I know who is looking for an optometrist.
5 Great staff,  Jocelyn was very bubbly and helpful. I trusted her in making my choice in eye wear.  Dr. G answered my crazy hypochondriac questions with a smile and patience.  Will be going there again... Thank you all for my new fabulous pair of glasses! I love them!!
1 I've been going to this offce for the past 2 years, but no more! I've always had issues with their rude front desk staff. Then talking wih a friend recently, she also had an issue with their rude frot deak staff! They are discourteous, act like they don't have time to talk to you, and just make you feel like crap! ummm hello, but customer service is your job, if you can't deal with customers asking you a simple question, then maybe you should find another job! There is no excise for bad service and my family & I will no longer be going there.  I do not recommend this office.
