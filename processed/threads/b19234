5 I love Mikey's Eatery!  When a quick steam-table fix is what you need, Mikey's it the ticket.  Sesame Chicken is a favourite, as is the spicy pork.  The lineups can get long, especially during the lunch rush, but the service is quick and the line moves fast.  Lots of places to sit down and eat if you are so inclined.  Mikey, his family and staff have always been great to us when we dine there.  I heartily recommend Mikey's Eatery!
3 You know I hate most of the Chinese food here in Waterloo but I guess this place is the best one. Good price and edible Chinese food(which is hard to find).
3 With so many choices at the Waterloo plaza it is difficult to choose one chines restaurant to pick. Mikey's doesn't offer a lot of special food but their sesame chicken is worth going in for.
2 Pretty standard quick Asian food. Not a really good place for sit down. Mostly for students on the go
2 As the rating says...meh. I've experienced better.  The environment isn't exactly the best as it seems a bit run down. I feel like I should eat very fast and get out of there, since it's just that bad.  The food is also meh...coming from Markham, almost every single Chinese restaurant I go to there beat this place any day.  Price-wise it's good though, so are the servers. Otherwise...pass.
3 Mikey's mainly serves Chinese-Canadian fare on steam tables.   If you want a quick and filling meal that is a bang for your buck, you can't go wrong with their sesame chicken lunch special.   If you want authentic Chinese food, there are other places that are more worthwhile in the area.
2 The food is pretty expensive for what it is: generic steam table Chinese food. I would recommend other Chinese food in the plaza less you're in a hurry.
4 This place is great for some quick North Americanized Chinese food. I highly recommend the sesame chicken, and the curry noodles. Not everything there was delicious (stay away from the ribs). But when I was in first year university I went here probably once a week. It's one of the better places for students to hit up at University Plaza.
5 Mikey's makes the best sesame chicken you will ever have in your life. (Seriously. I can't explain it properly, but the sauce is of the perfect sweetness with a hint of tang that gets you salivating just from the smell! The chicken is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It is to DIE for.) Their curry noodles are amazing, their salt and pepper pork is delicious, and if you're a steamed-rice girl like me, they use only the BEST quality rice for perfect fluffy white rice. Mmm! They have vegetarian options and use fresh, good quality ingredients. They also serve HK Style milk tea and lemon tea which is a rare find in Waterloo! Their 'Canadianized' Chinese food is fantastic (for takeout too!) but they also have 'real' Chinese food you can order that is not on the steam table.   I think the environment is cute and colourful! They have plenty of seating and friendly staff. It's family-run which means the food is more authentic, and the owners actually put soul into the dishes.  Mikey's is probably my favourite restaurant in Waterloo. I recently moved to Toronto, and I can't find a place like it here! I miss it!
4 best sesame chicken!! I haven't had any  curry noodles are delicious, so are the regular noodles (with the red sauce on top!)  prices are a bit pricey so i usually just get the chicken.
3 The more authentic tasting chinese food in university plaza but still white washed. They give you a lot, so its perfect for the university student who wants to get really full for a decent price.
3 Meh, Mikey's is alright. Hits the spot when you want to grab something quick on the way to campus but the food is pretty thoroughly average. I usually just the two item option and honestly there's not too much to say about it. Panda King around the corner has the same style and the food tastes slightly better and there are a few other Chinese places in the plaza that are better.
1 I tried the sesame chiken and got food poisoning. Been in bed, having headaches and vomiting all night.
2 Been eating here for some time now, but I've never been so offended here before. The food was always cheap and decent, and the people working here were nice - but in the past couple of months the food quality (let alone taste) has been going down - undercooked or overcooked - and finally, they've reached their low point today. Being badgered into making a quick decision is not pleasant, nor is being snapped at for every question, nor is the eye-rolling when asked to repeat what they've said. Very offended, very disappointed.
3 came here many times.  Big portion size, cheap. Quick. I like the sesame chicken the most. The chicken were crunchy and tasty (a bit salty). However, if it's the last bits on the food tray, it may be a bit soggy. Best when its first out of the kitchen. The fried rice was always bland and sometimes soggy. Well you pay what you get. The curry fried noodle, however, was much better - more flavorful and chewy noodle. just need to add ~$0.60 (or more, cant remember), to change from fried rice to noodle.  Bad thing is that they charge you 50 cent for using credit card. But overall, I'd come back whenever I have to eat at the plaza.
1 I had the salt and pepper pork. It you are unfamiliar with this delicacy don't try it here, it gives it a bad name. Maybe I just I had too high of an expectation? Anyway the pork was cut into bite sized pieces for whatever reason and just didn't taste or look authentic.   So I was pretty down. Whats even worse that 85% of my meal was just rice. When I finished the pork I literally had nothing left so It came to a point where i was just eating plain rice. Now normally you would like equally distribute the food items with the rice but there were just so few pieces. I would have been happier with a Panda King meal.  Perhaps I didn't try their best dish, but nothing about the meal is worth a second try and the service wasn't even that friendly. 2/10 Pandas
