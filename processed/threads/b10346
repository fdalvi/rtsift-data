4 It's not the most beautiful office, nor is it the fanciest. But Dr Tong is friendly, knowledgeable, good with my dental phobias, and unlike some dentists, doesn't seem to want to make his next mortgage payment just on my mouth. Minus one star only for atmosphere...not for quality of work.
5 I've been going to Dr. Tong for the past few years!  Hands down, he's the best!  So attentive and delicate w/ his procedures. I'm usually a nervous wreck when seeing a dentist because I have this god-awful gag reflex but Dr. Tong is very gentle yet skillful... Definitely makes me feel more at ease. I live in Irvine but make a point to see him once/yr when I'm in Vegas!  Highly recommended!!!
5 I see Dr. Tong and am very happy with the service I received. I've had exams, cleanings, minor work, and major work and I keep going back because they are great! The reception staff, administrative staff are first rate. No one likes to go to the dentist but they make it a good experience.
