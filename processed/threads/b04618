3 Got there around 8pm and they were packed!!!  All the tables inside were full and the tables outside were full.  CRAZY!    They had 3 employees working so the line flowed steady.  We got our ice cream to go, since the place was packed.    Store the clean, employees are friendly, and the ice cream is good!
4 Bit pricey, but it's always been our favorite place to go for treats....
4 It's small, busy, with bad indoor seating but I came for the ice cream! Delishous! I always get the founders favorite, and instead of the pecans I get extra brownies.  Cold stones is a great place.
5 Haven't been here in a long time, a lot of new options to choose from!   They were super busy when we came in but they were working fast and the employees were very friendly.  Will keep in mind for future ice cream outings :)
5 Great experience! We stop by for a quick treat and were very happy with no lines, super friendly service and quick check out. Will be stopping by again!   Amazing staff!
3 I went in last night to get ice cream with my husband. The particular ice cream mix that I was looking for wasn't on the menu "Cheesecake Fantasy," so I just described it to one of the girls behind the counter.  She knew right away what I was talking about asked for the size and ran off to make it. I was looking forward to getting a waffle cone cup, but I didn't even have the chance to tell her before she was done. She didn't ask either.   Part of the reason why I felt we were a little rushed off during the time spent inside.  Was because three gentlemen had arrived before us and it seemed like they all knew each other.  They all talked during the whole time we were there.   We won't be coming back to this location again.
