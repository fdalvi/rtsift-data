5 This is the second year in a row that we've used Terry Williams' services for our tax preparation and I am so pleased!  For any of you who have procrastinated with your tax filing - give Terry a call pronto!  She typically takes one week or less to prepare your taxes no matter how complicated they may be and she is vey receptive to answering your questions big and small.  If you're like me and are not astute in the financial department, it's nice to have someone who responds to you quickly and intelligently.  I also appreciate Terry's affordable cost.  I don't think it should cost an arm and a leg to have someone prepare your taxes.  Terry typically charges between $150-$200 which is very competitive!
5 I have used Terry two years in a row and she has provided an excellent service each time. She provides a very detailed, and helpful, account of your taxes. Unlike H&R Block or other tax service companies which you essentially pay to run TurboTax for you; she has an excellent understanding of the tax code. I strongly recommend her.
5 I read the reviews here and since there were only two and had been sort of dated, I figured I'd just take a chance and see.  Well, I met her and right off the bat I knew I'd stick with her.  Terry was very professional and quite attentive to my need.  She was very friendly and caring, which is a hard character to find in a CPA.  After a week, as promised, my taxes were done and filed and got it deposited in my bank in a week!  wow.  I'll be coming back to her next year again!  Thank you, Terry!
