5 Saw Dr. Giancola today.  I was referred there by another doctor in the practice (who's also very good)  for a second opinion.  Great bedside manner. Personality is great. Patient.  Spent time with me. Explained things quite simply.  I would highly recommend him.
5 I highly recommend Southwest Skin Specialists!  My experience was pleasant from start to finish.   Their front office staff is friendly and professional.  I noticed that they are careful about patient privacy and up to current standards and regulations.  The check-in process is flawless! My wait time was minimal, if at all.  I was interviewed by an assistant first, then she immediately brought in the doctor after reviewing my concerns with him.  Dr. Benjamin LeSeuer summarized my primary concern, addressed and treated my health issues, and showed the utmost sensitivity to my secondary concern, which is financial in nature. This is a practice that runs smooth and has a cohesive team of caring professionals!
5 Dr. LeSueur was recommended to me by another reputable doctor. I found him to be very good. He discussed my condition, spent time answering questions and took samples for lab work as necessary. Getting in quickly may be a problem. My other doctor helped. Maybe I didn't make it sound urgent enough. He has two locations.
