3 Sometimes service is slow. It depends who if working. If it's a slow person  who shows no interest that people are in a hurry,  get ready for a wait.
3 Never seems to be any hot dogs or grill items cooking here.  Some days the machines are off, without any out of order sign. Maybe the demand is not there for it.  Better to get your ready grill items at the QuikTrip at 19th Ave and Loop 101.  Service is slow here sometimes if there are a lot of people in line.  And I guess when there are multiple people working, they are not instructed to step in to help at the registers if, say, they are doing inventory or filling the ice or something else.  Standard Circle K service level though.  Nothing compared to QT of course where they hurry to get you in and out.  Convenient location.  Easy access in and out.  Limited parking spaces.
3 The most important thing... the restrooms at this one were CLEAN! With kids (girls) that are 6 and 8 - that is very important to me. I can always stand - they can't.  The checkout line was really long... and the other person working the store was not paying attention. We had to ask him to come to the register...to which he replied he would be just a min. I guess stacking beer was more important than checking 6+ people out - as his version of a min was more like 5.
2 It didn't used to be so bad, if the lines are long they go slow. There are always these hoodlum kids that loiter around outside, making the place seem unsafe and sketchy.   And they hang out with their friends that work there during the night shift. Although the men employees seem to hand out free drinks alot..
