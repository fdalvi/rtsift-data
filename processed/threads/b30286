5 very good coffee, great service & owner is super nice  if you are near this place and want a drink... DEFINITELY go here!
3 Ok, not a big coffee shop person.  I even try to avoid caffeine.  I stopped in here to pass some time waiting for Pork on a Fork to open.   The barista (owner?) was pleasant and cheerful and I could tell she knew most of her customers well.  They don't do brewed decaf because she said she ends up selling about one cup before it gets old so I got a regular.  She said she could make me a decaf Americana but I had no clue what that meant and rather than take up her time with another customer waiting I passed.  Drinking it black by itself it was only an OK cup of coffee but at under $2 it was certainly a better deal than one of the name brand coffee houses.  They offer free wi-fi.  I liked the small cozy atmosphere of the place.
5 Best coffee around. I was not a coffee snob until a friend got me to try this place.   Now I cannot get enough. I struggle to drink anyone else's coffee.   The service is excellent as well and the owner is incredibly personable and friendly. She gets to know you. She is clearly passionate about coffee and people alike.   TRY IT OUT!
1 Out of business now :(
5 Delicious coffee and the owner is very sweet and friendly! She makes the best chai lattes. Also, they have almond milk which is my favorite. Most coffee shops only have soy as a non- dairy option so having almond milk is a huge plus in my book!
5 Excllent cozi shop! Love their coffee It is under new ownership and she is a breath of fresh air
5 We were looking for coffee after lunch right around the Deer Valley airport and saw the Coffee Grove's flag on the side of the road.  Jill made me feel right at home from the moment I walked in. The coffee was excellent and strong. I would have gone back for more just before closing if I didn't have a long flight ahead of me.  I'll definitely be back. I can hardly wait for our next trip to DVT!
