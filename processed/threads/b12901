4 I love the city of Las Vegas. Home of drunken girls walking barefoot after the hours of 1AM and hobos being blunt that they just want money for beer. Las Vegas is a big tourist spot and stays true to making sure there's something for everyone. The strip which is the storefront of the city has much to offer. The hotel buildings are all uniquely built, they have free shows during the night, and bridges for pedestrians to walk over instead of waiting for the walk sign. Because of its popularity, Las Vegas Blvd on most weekends are jammed packed with cars that'll move at like 5 mph up and down the strip. There will be crazy and impatient taxi drivers and all.   So what's my complaint? If you're one of those people who walk when the walk sign isn't on, and because of you the car whose suppose to be turning cannot turn, I hope you lose your money and shoes in Vegas. That's just inconsiderate. Come across way too many of these in Vegas.
5 I love old and New Las Vegas!
4 Always something new going on or to explore. Never boring
