5 1st day open !! Fast great food!! Huge portions and good w pricing. Free condiments. Drive thu and also open 24hours
1 Food is not that great.  Roberto's is better.  Definitely not worth the money, I can make better rolled tacos for a lot less.
1 WTF?  Today i ordered by phone for pick up because that was easiest for us.  That's how we do at Robertos.    Maybe there's a language barrier between me and the lady taking my order but I really think they should learn their menu in English before taking orders by phone.  Or maybe they got lost in translation between the lady who took the order and the person who put our order together.  I don't know!!  I ordered Carne Asada fries NO BEANS!!   And plain Nachos with cheese.  First of all, the Carne asada fries clearly had beans.  Omfg the nachos were a joke.  I will post a pic, so refer to that.  It's tortilla chips and it looked like they just melted shredded cheddar cheese on top.  The cheese was really hard.  Really???  Mexican restaurant with no real nacho cheese?  They had to melt shredded cheddar cheese which hardened by the time we got home.    back to Robertos we go.  What a waste of space in southern highlands.
5 Don Tortaco- authentic and fast! I'm giving it five stars because it's open twenty four hours. This location reminds me of several Sunset Blvd locations in Beverly Hills in Cali.
5 Came here to just try it out, but then their food just blew me away! The service is way better then Roberto's the workers actually serve with a smile! The drive through is really convenient. Awesome experience overall and I would defiantly come back again!
2 This place gets 2 stars cause the food is decent.  The biggest problem I have with this place is they can never get my order right. I always check my order before I leave but the burritos they always screw up. Can't really tell what's in it until you take a bite and I'm not about to unroll a burrito before the leave the restaurant.  Maybe I'll be going back to Robertos
