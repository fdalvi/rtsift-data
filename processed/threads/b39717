4 Love frozen yogurt and yogurtland is the best self- serve. The flavors change and you can fill up your cup as much as you want, just got to remember they give oversized cups on purpose! Lol!  I got coconut and pistachio swirl and so good! Unfortunately no chocolate sprinkles but plenty of other options including colored sprinkles. We shared and enjoyed it! The people watching sitting at the tables is always fun!  The girl at the register had no personality and she was compared to a rock when we asked one question!  Definitely enjoyed my late night treat! The fro yo is the creamiest compared to other self serve places I've tried. Oh and this must be new location as its inside Excalibur! Up in food court area near popcorn place
4 For being inside the casino it's actually a really good place for yogurt. They have a lot of different flavors and you can try them before you buy.  And they also have a lot of toppings. You pay by the ounce... So be careful about how much you put in your cup and how many toppings you put on. Everything has weight :)  The stuff was friendly and the taste and quality of the yogurt was really good. So if you're in the mood for frozen yogurt in a lot of different flavors and options... Definitely give it a try.  I had a really decent size container of yogurt... With some toppings for less than five dollars.
5 Grrr no green tea yogurt.  The girl at the counter was so sweet and nice and she told me that they would not bring the macha green tea to the Vegas location. So I guess the only place I can get it is when I go back to LA since they have it there. (Sad Face)  But I still have Jamba Juice so I can suffer for just a little bit. lol
