5 My son has been going to this dojo for several years and has really enjoyed his experience and learned a lot.  The owners and staff treat each child with respect and as an individual.  The kids groups (there are two) are typically small and allow a lot of individual instruction and ample opportunity for practice.  Finally, the prices are very reasonable and the kids practice times are compatible with working parents work hours (e.g. classes are on weekend and/or early evening vs. afternoons).  I can recommend this studio whole heartedly.
5 Everything Sharon S. said. My son has been going to this dojo for almost six years and will soon move up to the adult class. The senseis - including the owners - have given him the special attention he needs, and it has done wonders for his personal development.
5 A fantastic dojo run by two of the most talented practitioners of Kokikai Aikido in the world. Kokikai Aikido was founded by Shuji Maruyama Sensei in the 1980s. He was a student of both Ki Society founder Koichi Tohei Sensei and the creator of aikido itself, Morihei Ueshiba Sensei. Maruyama Sensei, however, has developed an incredibly subtle and powerful variety of aikido that surpasses anything else I've experienced in the martial arts world, much less the aikido world. Nachman Sensei and Burrows Sensei have been students of Maruyama Sensei for decades, and their dojo in Tempe is one of the nuclei of Kokikai practice in the United States. You will not regret joining their ranks. Train hard, be patient with yourself, and enjoy not only the power of aikido but the joy of engaging in a safe, non-competitive martial art in a world that seems overly impressed with MMA and jujitsu.
