5 Amazing service, I'm very happy with the job Sierra did on my hardwood floors.  A sewage leak caused my hardwood floors to be torn up but instead of removing them so that they could be used again, the plumber did a total hack job on the floor.  I tried getting an estimate on repairing the floor from another company and they told me it was impossible to fix the floor but they could add another wood floor on top of the existing one, it was ridiculous.  I remember driving by Sierra Hardwood Floors - it's also in Coronado.  I've seen their truck working on homes in the neighborhood.  I gave them a call and they were there the same day.  They were able to fix the floor and the repair is seamless.
1 This company has sketchy business practices. It took them over 7 weeks to do our small job and then DOUBLED their price once the job was done. They never called to let us know the price increased prior to doing the work. Will never use them again. Consumer beware! Their explanation? "The initial quote was just an estimate"
1 Picked out our wood floor and amazing, from the time we picked out the floor until the next day's contract the floor price went up $3.00 a square foot.  Was told the factory had a price increase the day the measuring was done. They sure don't know how to do business.
