2 After 3 attempts I think im through with this place. First time chow mein was burned. Second the food tasted like it sat around for a long time and the third it just wasnt anything special. I am not sure if this is because they are not in that great of a location. This wasnt my first experience with Panda express. I have enjoyd their food at other locations just fine.

5 One of the best Panda Express I have ate at. Only one better was at ASU because no food would sit long enough to go bad. Food is always good, always fresh. Will drive out of my way to eat at this one even though I drive by a different one on the way home. I recommend this location.
1 It's 9 pm and all the workers are pretending like they're closed....doors are locked. Lame!
1 Food looks wonderful, price is so-so, place is clean and well lit, the PROBLEM is everything in your plate is loaded with SALT!  Is this a flavoring agent to cover the bland taste? I got so sick I had to go home and take a blood pressure pill and lay down! I totally gave up, folks... This was not the first time for me. MSG? I don't know if they use it, I like MSG in small amounts in Chinese food, but PE mixes Copious Amounts of SALT!
5 Best panda express around! Everything is clean, fresh, and not oilly or too salty.  Also, the people that work here are friendly, and efficient.  Keep up the good work!
