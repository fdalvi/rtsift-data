2 I'm a frequent flier with Big Lots, but this store is neither special nor is it nice... Nor is it particularly clean! I just happened to be in the area, thought I'd give it a whirl... Better off checking out the store on McKellips & Scottsdale rd., or Thomas and 32nd st.
4 This is one of the crappiest Big Lots I've been in. So why the 4 stars? Because they try... The staff is a bit "off"but they are so much more friendly than some other locations. The lady who was ringing up my purchase had to stop in the middle for a sec because the shiny ornaments I was purchasing startled her. She had to take a step back,got all twitchy for a moment,apologized for the delay,explained that the mini disco ball "scared"her,re-composed herself and finished ringing up the sale. I give her credit for carrying on even with the fear and hope the experience gave her the confidence to know she can persevere. Big Lots,I salute you.
1 This place is always understaffed.  You can wait in line to check out for 20 min. or more.  Also their check-out process seems less than efficient.
4 Sure, why not?  I found my patio furniture here and I'm happy with it, happy with the service I received, and happy with the price.
