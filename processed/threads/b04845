5 come see charito!
1 I did not receive service at this location, I tried, but failed. I went in on Sunday 12/1, the four stylist were busy, ok fine. I walked in and was looked at but never acknowledged. I stood there patiently while a previous client was being rung up very slowly. A stylist was free and grabbed her next client (possibly a friend since she had a coffee waiting for her), sitting right by where I was standing, and still no "we'll be with you shortly" nothing. I wanted to know the cost to have my bangs trimmed and after 10 mins of being ignored I walked out. Terrible customer service, won't be back!
5 I have been coming here for about 3 years now I believe. the prices are great and Erica is the BEST!
5 Went for a haircut, isn't my usual place as I was far from home that Saturday. Walked-in was taken back shortly and given a dare I say "fantastic" haircut. Good conversation, I was never having that this-is-a-only-for-ladies hair place. It's many miles from my home but I will still go back.
