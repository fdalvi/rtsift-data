2 I really wanted to like this place, but something about it is just fairly disappointing.   The shop itself is a kind of mish mash of cafe and takeaway with a jumble of tea-themed items displayed. The cakes in the window remind me of cakes from my childhood; homebaked and laiden with icing, sprinkles and sweeties.  I've been in twice now. The first time I got some cake to take away. The victoria sponge was nice, so I thought I would go back again and sit in. I went in with the boy for breakfast today, but unfortunately it was really disappointing. I had pancakes with bacon and the boy had a cooked breakfast. His breakfast looked pretty grim, with a good third of the plate taken up with watery looking scrambled eggs. The bacon looked wet and pale like ham, not crispy and fried.   Overall it was a very disappointing breakfast, I'd have preferred to stay home with my fruit and fibre!   That being said, the cake I had was tasty.
