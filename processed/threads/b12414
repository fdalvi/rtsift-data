3 Why it is good: -Drive Thru  The Bad: -Lots of traffic in an extremely small parking lot - They dont know how to make a Vanilla Tea Latte... technically this is all starbucks, but it makes me angry that the one by my house cant try to figure out how to make one.  - Kills Ma and Pop coffee shops (as a company)
2 The line for this drive thru wrapped around the building and took FOREVER to move.  I realized why when I finally got to the window to pick up my grande coffee.  I wasn't even acknowledged to pay for at least 2 minutes and then it took another minute to get my coffee.  I can't imagine how much longer I would have waited for a soy latte.  Normally I would run in and get my coffee but it was an early Saturday morning after a late night.  I wasn't willing to get out of the car.  In any case, next time I'm heading up to the drive thru at Glendale and 16th for a cup at McDonald's.
4 It's not local. It's not new. It's not subverting the dominant paradigm.  It is, however, the only coffee drive through for a significant radius in this part of town. I live north and west, and work south and east of this particular location. Every time I stop by my drive-thru clerk is cheerful, introduces his- or herself, suggests a signature drink, and very often compliments my haircut when I get to the window. All of these things I appreciate, especially when coupled with consistently tasty beverages - right now I'm loving the short peppermint latte - served in the comfort of my own automobile (say that like you're in Sixteen Candles).   It's always highly populated, make sure that you enter the parking lot from 16th Street - it's easier to get into the line from that direction.   If you only have 5 minutes and you can't make a u-turn on a residential street, this location might not be for you. Please, keep your patient hats on! However, a suburban is able to negotiate the drive-thru and parking lot without a problem.
5 If you like coconut, then you have to try the new coconut frappacino's. They taste like a Samoa girl scout cookie blended in a cup. I'm usually an iced coffee kind-of-girl but when I sampled this wonder drink, I changed my order and enjoyed a little sip of paradise instead.
1 I thought I was going to die without my caffeine fix.  The drive thru line took forever and the parking lot was full.  I don't understand why after the service I got.
