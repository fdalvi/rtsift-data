5 Small retail location, but this the place that gun shops were meant to be. Once I walked in there just for grins, and noticed a used gun they had on display. A couple days later I went to go pick it up and called before I had left. Not only did the person on the phone tell me if it was still in stock, but he examined it for me on the phone answering specific questions (trying to figure out if the Beretta 92 was new model or old model). Great service. My wife and I went in there and stayed for an hour or so just talking. Overall great experience.
5 Used them again for a transfer. Freaking awesome as always, great transfer prices too!
5 Having them receive a gun, and help me ship a gun out. The same level of service I expect from my past visits, and Kate even gave some advice to help me avoid getting ripped off by a buyer (doing an out of state sale). I love how they talk to their customers like they are people, and don't have the typical gun store arrogance that many shops around the valley can have. I also noticed that during the rush of panic buying their prices have stayed more or less consistent. No gouging there, one of the best places in the valley for no BS sales, and a general good time.
1 Not impressed at all typical small gun shop. Lady was more interested in talking with someone about political talk radio than taking to the gun store customer. Her business card for the talk radio was on the counter every three or four feet. It was apparent that that was the most important thing there not guns
5 Good store for gun transfers.  They are gun people and understand the importance of getting things right
