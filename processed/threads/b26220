5 five stars for the drive-thru. =) in and out in 2.5 secs.
4 I love this Bank of America location for a couple of reasons. First is that it is very close to my house. Second is that it is never busy, you can usually walk right up to the counter.  The only downside to this location is that they do not have a drive-thru. I know ( LAZY) but it is Vegas and it is getting hot.
4 I'd like to give a big Thank You to Julio T. at this BOA Location. My girlfriend was having problems with an unnamed but nearby competing bank that has been treating her poorly. Julio is very knowledgeable about many of BOA products and services. We got everything we needed done in a quick and efficient manner. Julio could not have been nicer. If your tired of crap from Wells Fargo (oops) come over to BOA.  O and the review below this is not accurate, there is no Drive through at this BOA, this is the one near the Paseos.
5 This is a great location.  Rarely busy and amazing staff.  Everyone is friendly and helpful and it seems like they know most of their clients by name.  The bank itself is well maintained and bright.  Very convenient to the 215.
1 I have never met such incompetent people before. I would never bank here or at any other Bank of America. I had an auto loan with BOA and they sent me a reimbursement check. I went to deposit it at my bank and my bank stated that BOA issued the check to me and Bank of America. So I had to go to BOA for them to sign it and then I could deposit it.   I went to this bank and they made me wait 45 minutes. He first had to verify that I had a loan and then made some excuse as to why it took so long. After 45 minutes, the banker told me that next time I should have them issue the check to my bank. He didn't apologize for how long it took and then blamed me. Nice customer service.
1 Terrible customer service. The branch manager Abigail does not seem to be able to offer solutions  I'm moving my banking to Bank of Nevada
