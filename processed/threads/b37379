5 Lovely coffee, friendly proprietor, comfortable atmosphere.  A little bit of Paris in Edinburgh.
5 OH MY OH MY!  Little did I know when i stumbled on this on Facebook i was entering a little Paris!  My Friend Lou and I first visited this together on this very grim day in the burgh ... it was snowy, wet, windy ... geee it was grim but once you entered this lovely cafe, it was lovely little warm tranquil place in the heart of this grand city.  I was needing something hearty and warm so opted for the soup  of the day, which was Courgette.   I had never tried courgette soup but easily could of had another bowl no bother as it was so delicious!  Lou had earl grey, which was loose leaf in a bag, the smell was devine!  I couldn't believe Lou hadn't had macarons before but she enjoyed the coffee and the pistachio macarons and i opted for the raspberry and the pistachio Macarons!  It's cheap too!  It's truly worth a visit ... especially if you need a little bit of Paris to keep you sweet!
