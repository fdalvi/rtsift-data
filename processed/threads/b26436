4 I got my iPhone4 stolen last June and I waited for about 6months. Finally decided to get an iPhone4S couldn't deal with stupid blackberry anymore. Nick was very helpful and understanding.  Even though I'm not 100% satisfied with at&t company it self but, I give 4stars  ONLY because of great customer service! (FYI-Nick only works on the weekend at this location.) The other guy was kinda rude and didn't really give a $hit about my stolen iPhone4 =(
4 I've noticed that this place opened up a while ago back and forth from my house, although I usually go to the Blue Diamond or Durango AT&T.  I've had trouble with my bluetooth with a new phone, and calling AT&T didn't solve it, so I stopped by this place on the way home. Even though I wasn't purchasing anything or even looking around, they were very helpful in assisting me with the problem that I had, and explained thoroughly on what to do next time the same thing happens.   I've experienced some poor customer service in other AT&T stores, but with this short visit, they may have increased the chance of purchasing my next phone here.
5 This AT&T is fabulous.  I received excellent customer service from manager Tony and sales rep Cleo.  These guys seriously know what they are doing, and they are so cool about everything.  They set up your device for you once you purchase it, and they don't mind if you come in without purchasing anything - just to ask questions.  They are seriously awesome.
