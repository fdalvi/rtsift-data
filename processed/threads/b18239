4 A place I can trust not to horribly scrape my car and to (mostly) get out those hard water stains from sprinklers is this Terrible's.   The $6 wash is enough for most cars;  at $10 you get a paper towel and an air freshener, and Rain-X, which is about as useful as leprechaun insurance most of the year.  But they do scrub your car down and have free vacuum stations for you to use afterwards!  It's a 3.5 star affair.
5 I love coming here, you can find me here every 10 days like clock work!  I usually get the cheapest wash, they scrub the car as it's going through. The free vacuums are wonderful too. I love this location!
3 This is a good car wash.  It is one step above your regular drive thru carwash because there is actually a person you speak too before driving in.  It is nice to see a face, instead of a computer punch screen.  The carwash comes with an air freshener and a dry cloth to wipe your car down afterwards, if you feel like it.  I never feel like it because seriously, it is usually so hot here the water just evaporates before you hit the street and I may be carwash lazy too.  Shhh, don't tell anyone!  Needless to say, I have a nice collection of these cloths.  They come in handy around the house too, in case you were wondering.    Before you go into the wash itself, there is someone, sometimes 2 people who will scrub your windshield and wheels, depending on the wash you purchased, to really get your car nice and clean.  After they scrub your car, you drive through a normal drive thru car wash and blow dryers at the end.    Nothing fancy, but when you don't have time for a full service carwash/detailing, this place gets the job done and quickly too!  This station also offers you $.20 off each gallon of gas if you purchase your carwash at the pump, so it even saves you some moolah on your fill up.
3 This place is serviceable if you need something quick and dirty.  Not a fan of car washes that uses huge brushes via drive through, it can damage your car.  The guys wiping down the car afterwards were nice and helpful.  I think at the end of the day you want to ask yourself if you want to spend 15 more bucks for a very nice hand wash car or do you want to do you want a quickey?
