5 No reviews? It's probably because it's in South Phoenix and it's a small hole in the wall.   They have the best cerviche (Sinaloa style) ever. Oh and you might need to know Spanish to order but it's well worth it.
5 The best ceviche I have had in the U.S. They have other thing I can't wait to try.  Very friendly staff.  Don't blink you will miss it.
3 Good food but way too over priced.
2 Came in on a Friday night to have dinner with the family food was ok, nothing to write home about.   Avoid coming to this place on the weekend if you want to have a conversation with your guest. The tacatacas and karaoke dj make it impossible for you to talk and enjoy your food. Its becomes a bar full of  depressed fat girls singing songs that make you want shoot yourself. Also, make sure you check your bill the wait staff tends to over charge. Too pricey for South Phoenix.
