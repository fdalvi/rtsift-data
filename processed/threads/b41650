5 Daniel provides excellent instruction and is very knowledgeable when it comes to setting and working towards various fitness goals. I was recently able to check out the new facilities. They are clean, organized and inviting. If you are looking to exercise smarter and more efficiently, I highly recommend you meet with Daniel and develop a plan!
5 DC Elite Fitness provides options for either one-on-one training or group Bootcamp training. Daniel the owner and head trainer is  very patient and knowledgable and a great motivator.   I participate in the Bootcamp class between 4 to 5 days a week and it is a very motivational/fun environment with great people. I would highly recommend anyone to check DC Elite fitness out if you are looking for a fun place to workout while working toward your desired results.
