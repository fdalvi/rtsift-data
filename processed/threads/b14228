3 Conveniently located near good food and a Starbucks. This in my world is a "trifecta of awesomeness."
2 This is the branch in the parking lot, not the branch inside Fry's, Guadalupe and McClintock Tempe.  I occasionally pay my credit card bills in person.  On one particular trip they noticed that I paid with a Credit Union check.  They must have looked up in the computer to see what services I had with the bank, because the following week, someone in that branch Cold Called me and offered to review my account services that I had with Chase.  I was questioned why I no longer had a Chase checking account and why I was banking with a Credit Union.  (this was just before last falls Bank-Transfer-Day protest. I explained that I did not appreciate them calling me about this, and that I was perfectly satisfied with my credit union, and that eventuality I would have all my banking services with a credit union.   I should also mention that all my Chase accounts opted out on marketing, so they should have not called me for this.
2 I have been to the branch a few times since my original review.  If Chase monitors their comment pages, my review may have had and an effect.  I'm no longer asked questions about my financial services etc.
