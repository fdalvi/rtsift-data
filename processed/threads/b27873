3 This place was my first choice when I was on the hunt for a fancy bottle of wine for my parents' anniversary, but I have to say I didn't find it here.  If it's whisky you're after, or a more day-to-day bottle of wine, then this is definitely your place. I'd been landed with the task by my siblings of hunting down a bottle of red wine bottled in 1980 for my parents' 30th wedding anniversary, and the manager I spoke to in here was quoting me upwards of £3000 for a bottle.  We ended up paying only £60 for it, from a different retailer. I can't help but not really trust the guys in this shope after that.  That said, when I was in the shop I can safely say I have never seen so many bottles of armagnac or whisky under one roof - next time you're stuck for a present for any male relative then you should probably give this place a try.
4 Although merchants of fine wine don't feature in my list of most visited places, the Cristal on display and other alcoholic fancies available in Nicolas made for an interesting browse.  What makes Nicolas approachable is the helpful owner; an informative Frenchman whom obviously has a passion for all things wine.  Rather than wandering around aimlessly looking at confusing grape varieties and brands, ask a few questions, poke and prod a bit (metaphorically speaking!) and no doubt you'll find a gem.
4 If you are looking for a fancy bottle of wine as a gift then I would definitely recommend taking a trip into Nicolas Wine merchants. They have an extensive range of fancy wines and champagnes that are the perfect gift ideas. You won't find any cheap old Lambrini or Blossom Hill in here, you can be sure of that.  The shop is well organised and everything is very well presented. The staff are very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about all the wines. This is completely wasted on me as I have no clue about wine and to me most of it just tastes like turps but then again the stuff I usually try doesn't cost £50+ a bottle like the wines here.
