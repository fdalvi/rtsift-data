5 WHAT: For those who are not familiar USO centers are available for military personnel as a comfort lounge fully equipped with couches, food, computers, etc. Quality varies depending on what airport you are at. It is usually located before the security check points.  LOCATION: Terminal 2 in Sky Harbor Airport on Mezzanine level. Go to the stairs by the food court and it's down the hall.  ATMOSPHERE: VERY very nice! Everything looks clean and new. They have several rooms here - a movie room, kids play room, video game room with gaming chairs and 2 video game systems, kitchen, main area with couches, tables, computer lab, and mini-library. Books are free to take from the library as well! Flat screens in every room just about. Military memorabilia and neat artifacts hanging every where.  PERKS: All kinds of movies, internet access, cable tv and free snacks! Candy, granola bars, drinks, fruit with microwave, coffee machine access. Great for carry-on snacks on a long flight. The cleanest bathrooms in the airport are down the hall!! SERVICE: EXCELLENT! 2 attendants in the lounge who were so very nice. We came 15 minutes before closing at 8pm but were so welcoming and offered us everything that they could offer. CONCLUSION: I would definitely visit here again! Very comfortable lounge with superb service. Although not the biggest USO I've been to it's definitely the best USO I have ever been to!
