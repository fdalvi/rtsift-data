4 Sunshine Daydream had a cool selection of merchandise. It carries many "hippie themed" clothing and accessories. There was also a decent selection of vintage posters. Although some things are a little high-priced, I did pick up a few things (like a cool bamboo wind chime) for a good price off a sale rack.
5 This is a self-described "hippie store," and it delivers the goods. Bumper stickers galore, band t-shirts in spades, and a fine selection of blown glass in the back.  Hendrix, Garcia, and the Beatles are all alive and well here.  Prices are good, but most importantly, the employees are the nicest in town. It's a must shop if you're a bleeding heart, and you should stop in even if you're not...just for kicks and/or a heart attack. Then you'd be bleeding heart though...  Their website is actually really good for an Indy place like this, as is their Facebook page.
4 While their merchandise is awesome, the staff is polite to a point which writing a review praising their awesomeness is warranted. The only qualms I have about Sunshine Daydream is their disclaimer about their pipes stating: "Pipes are for tobacco use only". Really? I can understand if they need it for legal reasons, but odds are that the disclaimer will be largely ignored by a majority of their patrons.
