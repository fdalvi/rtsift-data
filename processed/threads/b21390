5 LOVE Volcom LV! I was on vacation from San Diego (love the shop there too), but Volcom Las Vegas is bigger, badder, louder. The staff seemed so stoked to be there, they must have fun. The store manager (Colin) was really helpful and made sure I got out of there with a store tee. Just steps off the strip, right by Hawaiian Tropic.  A must stop next time your in Vegas!!!!
5 I love volcom shorts man you can't beat them. This store has a wide variety of all things volcom, pretty cool. They can get pretty overpriced if you ask me, a kids hoodie was $60??? I mean come on my kid is only going to be able to wear it a couple months. ANyway, one of the better skate style shops in this mall since it actually has a selection worth seeing unlike DC.
4 Love the way the clothes fit me.  Prices are not too high. Pants around $55, shirts around $20, longsleeves around $45.
