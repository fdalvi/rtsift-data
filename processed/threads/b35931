4 So many options! I love coming to Goodwill because you can pretty much get an entirely new wardrobe for cheap. Half off Saturdays are my favorite as I can really stock up on some great items. Lately I have been truly blessed in finding items that still had the original tags on them  and being able to snag these items for around $4.50 each. Score!! Every Goodwill is different and I do check out a few of them, but I do enjoy coming to this one as it is a little bigger. I do wish they had more dressing rooms but all in all, you can't go wrong at Goodwill!
5 I support this Goodwill regularly. The staff here is friendly, the store is clean and you can find some nice things. I've had several good "finds" at this Goodwill including several pieces of clothing with the tags still on... It's a good sized store as well. I find shopping here on regular days is best since the 1/2 off days are a mad house, but if you really need to shop on a budget, try the 1/2 off days and do your best to relax while shopping as difficult as that may be LOL.
4 A great place to drop-off your seldom-used stuff. So many people just throw everything away when they no longer need it. If it looks halfway decent, I donate it and let Goodwill make the decision. On the flip-side, this is a great place to find things you didn't know you needed at super-cheap prices. I recently bought a full-suspension Gary Fisher mountain bike in great condition for $150! And there are tons of rarely-used kid's toys for only a few dollars each. A little bleach cleaning and your kids are stoked! Don't forget to look for charging cords here before buying a new one. There are phone and laptop chargers aplenty! Although it smells like used clothing, as you would assume, the store itself is clean and they keep it well organized. All of the employees have always been really nice, too.
4 Dropping off another donation!!  Feels to good to get the stuff out of the house!
