4 Moxie Java is a recently-opened little corporate-style coffee shop with a small lunch menu and some deserts.  Consider it Starbucks (plus) -- better coffee variety than Starbucks, wider menu, and wider selection of desserts.  Let's get the important details out of the way: thumbs up on the coffee.  They brew multiple varieties of coffee -- light roast, medium roast, dark roast, and flavored.  It's nice to have a choice downtown (since workers have been stuck with the burnt swill put out by Starbucks for year).  They also carry frozen, blended coffee and the barista will make a tasty mocha or latte.  Prices are pretty much Starbucks level ($2.25 for a medium cup of coffee).  It's nice to have a sittin' place downtown.  The ambiance is "corporate comfort"--fake hardwood floors, wooden chairs, fake fireplace.  The place is clean, the tables have space to work, and there's a few comfy chairs to sit in and read.  A plus is the free Wifi.  The food ain't bad.  The bakery products are fresh--the muffins are tasty (they'll also offer to warm it up for you).  There's a light lunch menu too (wraps, bagel sandwiches).  I've had the club wrap and it's pretty well put together (bacon: crispy. turkey: fresh. lettuce: fresh).  They have a daily soup as well: decent-enough.  The real score with this place is that they offer gelato.  Ice cream for lunch!  Score!  It's nice to have another cafe downtown.  There are few enough places to get food.
4 Really cute inside. Downside.... They are not open on the weekends. Locals would love it
3 Gelato is homemade!  I've never had bad gelato - I tried pretty much every single flavor they had available that day.  I was able to mix two flavors in my cup.  Blueberry and Coffee.  I forgot if they had free wi-fi or not, but there is plenty of space to sit/chill/lounge/hang out what have you - tons of indoor seating and there are also tables outside w/ umbrellas and chairs.  Moxie Java is right across from the court house and within walking distance from the Golden Nugget.  Very friendly and welcoming staff!
