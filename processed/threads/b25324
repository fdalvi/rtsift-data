1 For watching my daughter play club volleyball here has to be one of the worst places for parents. The volleyball courts are set up in the roller hockey rink, so you watch the volleyball behind the glass.  Trying to take pictures of your daughter is a difficult task and you could never get very close.  Proximity of the location is in North Tucson, from our house in Scottsdale it is close to 50 miles.  Does have a decent snack bar which is about the only available food place
5 Awesome! I come here all the time for open gym volleyball and indoor soccer. It's a great facility with lots of room. Good snack bar. The equipment is also very good! I love coming here.
5 We just signed up for indoor soccer and are so pleased with the facility. Everyone is so nice and professional. Cory is the person we dealt with to try to get our 11 year old on a team because they were full and he genuinely cares. Will definitely do this again! Everyone there was great!
4 4 stars for being one of the few places in the East valley where you'll find women's indoor volleyball league and they run them frequently.  minus a star for using weird tile-like material on the court as opposed to wood/laminate flooring.  wish they'd bring back vball open gym.  safe and mostly friendly atmosphere.
