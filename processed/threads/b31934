3 The inventory definitely favors housewares over clothing, and I am A-OK with that. It also changes pretty often.   Good record selection. More classic rock than you find in most thrifts, where the stock is mostly religious music, Christmas albums, and easy listening.  Be forewarned, someone there has an eye for vintage. Don't expect to snatch up a really cool mid-century knick-knack for a song. Most of those items are marked up accordingly.  Also, there is a fee if you use your debit or credit card, and don't have the minimum amount. I think it's 50 cents if you total is under $10, but I'm not entirely sure.
4 This is the kind of thrift store where you go in hope of finding something amazing, and either you do, or you leave empty-handed. It's about 2/3 housewares (including furniture) and 1/3 clothes.  The stock is distinctly curated, not the randomness of the Goodwill down the block, so cut glass and crystal are heavier on the shelves than random glassware of randomness. If you're interested in vintage clothing but not up for "vintage" or Buffalo Exchange prices, you may luck out here -- I did.
4 One of my favorite things about thrift shop are you never know what you will find, its either you find a treasure or leave empty handed. Phoenix Christian is a neat little thrift store, very clean and organized, the store do have more housewares and furniture which is great. They also have a variety selection of vintage items. Price are good for what its for, the staff are friendly and more than happy to assist you with anything. Will check back again to see what else they have.
5 This store reminds me of thrift stores when I was a kid, not the over priced ones like Goodwill. Everything is neat, but the thrill of the search is still there. Great customer service. Donations are right inside the front door.
