2 This store is an expensive food city!
3 The one thing with Bashas (as opposed to Fry's) is that things are a hit or miss.  Some items, they've got great prices on but others are more expensive.  This store is clean, large (in comparison to some Bashas), and the employees are friendly.
3 We only go here in times of quick pick up trips, even though they are the closest store to our house. Otherwise, we go the distance to Safeway or Fry's.   The "fresh" food always seems to practically spoil by the night I bought it. They don't carry some popular products that other grocers near by have. And the biggest downfall for me (And I have actually had 3 other friends tell me they avoid this grocery store for the SAME reason), is the judgment of the cashiers.   I have gotten multiple comments from one cashier about "Why would you do that to your hair? I don't like that color on you." (I didn't ask for your opinion..)   A couple of the older cashiers have made comments on our purchases and also comments on what they've noticed we frequently buy (like how much alcohol we buy). One trip, an older man lectured me about the new chips in the new drivers licenses and how it's the mark of the beast and how Jesus feels about this..while I was bagged and trying to leave. And I don't feel religion is an appropriate topic to bring up with a stranger.   It's hard not to spend the little bit more on gas, just so I can purchase my groceries somewhere without having to be judged.
