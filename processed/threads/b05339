5 We had a poor installation on our first Noritz Tankless and it was leaking and ruined the unit after only 2 years (Service Max). Called The Water Heater Man for repairs. Randy and Valentino assessed the situation, contacted Noritz and had a new unit installation done, inspected, and had us up and running again quickly. They were reasonably priced, honest and explained all our options. Our gas line for the tankless was installed incorrectly by Service Max and was never inspected. Randy and crew reinstalled it and we passed inspection with no problem. I can't say enough about this company! I will definately be calling them for any and all my plumbing needs. Great Job Guys! Thank you for everything!!
5 We had a tankless system installed a few years ago by a different company that did an improper install and could have caused serious damage to our home.  We called  The Water Heater Man and they worked with Noritz, were able to get us a warranty replacement and then they properly installed and inspected the new unit and ventilation.  A few weeks ago we called them for a minor plumbing leak and they had it fixed quickly and the charges were reasonable.  Nice to have a company that we can trust.  Thank You!
5 I went from a traditional water heater to a tankless Noritz System. After many profoundly inflated estimates I found Randys company, 'The Water Heater Man'. The estimate was on target and the job was done perfectly and passes city inspection the first time. Even the city inspector stated the job was well done and you can see they took the time and did not cut any corners with the venting system. I will use the Water Heater Man for all my household and renal units needs! Thank you all the people who work there!
