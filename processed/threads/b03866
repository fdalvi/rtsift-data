1 My friend was really scammed by these people.  Buyer beware!  DO NOT TRUST THESE SCAMMERS FORMERLY H K MOTORS  This company was formerly called H K Motors.  These incompetent scammers sold lemons to customers, promised to repair, then disappeared from Central Phoenix.  The car dealership who now inhabit their former residence gets complaints and clients searching for them EVERY DAY!    Their former residence is: H K Motors 4335 N 7th St Phoenix, AZ 85014 (602) 728-0951&#8206;  Do not deal with these people. They might just "disappear" on you too!
1 Hiya all! just wanted to take a moment and add another one star review to Auto Club's glowing one star review collection.  I purchased a Pulsar 2030 Taxi meter from Auto Club. After learning from the manufacturer that I could not install, program, or calibrate the meter myself I attempted to return the meter. I was told (after they had their mechanic check the meter out) that I would have to return.  Instead I'll sell the meter on Ebay and  bash Auto Club up and down the internet. For the record this is not a blackmail post. You wasted my time and my money but no recompense is needed.  I'd prefer to help bring you down.
4 I've gone there on several occasions and never had a problem there, professional and courteous service.  They added extra transmission oil since my car was low and was only charged for the oil, they didn't add labor charges.  would definitely go back
