3 its panda. decent food at decent price. nothing else
4 It's like any other panda, if you like one you like them all same food. This one is nice and clean
1 Horrible I got hear at 845pm they close at 930 and they did not have any food on the buffet to choose from. Everything was a 15-20 minute wait to order horrible. The attendant had a face like she was pissed that I came in. Not coming hear ever again.
4 I have been to this location a million times and the food is always really good. However, the lines are always really long for a really long time and they always run out of food. The restroom was spotless and the tables are always cleaned after they are used.
