5 At first I have to admit i had no idea what I was getting myself into signing up for The Hunt, but the moment that limo arrived I knew my friends and I were in for one wild night.  Taking us to places we never knew existed in Vegas, The Hunt is a super exciting scavenger hunt that by the end of the night leaves you wanting more, something the Vegas shows can't offer.  My favorite part was watching our friends zip line down Old Vegas, but my favorite picture is of my buddy Joe and the fear in his eyes while atop  the roller coaster at the New York New York.  We did so much in such little time, there are few experiences like this one....I can't wait to do it again... This a was an A+ Vegas night in my book!
5 Fun, exciting, adrenaline pumping is how I would describe The HUNT! I can't imagine a better way to experience Vegas and all of the incredible attractions it has to offer. The HUNT staff had so much energy! They made sure we didn't miss a beat. I Highly Recommend The HUNT for group events in Vegas, there were 12 of us and we had an absolute blast!
5 We did this today for a leadership team building event. The Team at Hunt made this an absolutely unforgettable experience!!! We had a great time and even more learned that Downtown is filled with fun facts and great memories of this beautiful city!!! My hats off to The Hunt Las Vegas for coming up with a creative way to seek out our cities old treasures incorporating the artistic revitalization of beautiful downtown!!!!
