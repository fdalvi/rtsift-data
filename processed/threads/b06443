5 Do you ride a Harley Davidson motorcycle? You just found the best shop in town to get your parts for your bike. Cecil and his wife Jenny are the nicest and most knowledgeable folks in town for aftermarket parts.   I ride an old shovelhead and this is THE place to go for in town for parts and answers for nearly any question you may have on maintaining your ride.  He has been in business for 30 years and you will understand why in one visit.  Cecil's also carry's seats, shirts, excellent quality leather vests, and if he don't have it he can get it.
5 when the harley dealer tells you they dont want to help you with pre evolution parts go to cecil. Great prices and knowledge of the older stuff. He helped out alot when I was building a basket cast 76 xlh. by far the best in vegas.
5 If you ride old iron this is the only place in town to get parts.  It's very rare he doesn't have a part you are looking for.  It's really nice not having to order parts and wait days/weeks to get them even if you save a few dollars, but his prices match most on the internet, plus it supports a local business.   Cecil and his wife are very helpful!
5 This is a cool shop they are very nice, extremely honest and very helpful. They don't try and sell you anything you don't need and they take their time to give you valid information to ensure you get what you really need. They don't stress you if you make a mistake they take back a valid exchange and give you what you need. I am truly a fan and if I ever buy a Harley they will be my shop for parts and accessories!  Oh and I forgot they give free skittels...I love skittels! Cecil and his lady are just easy going and nice people.
