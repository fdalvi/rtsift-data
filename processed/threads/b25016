5 My brake lights went out simultaneously.  So I figured it must be a fuse, right?  By the time I got around to opening up my fuse box and tinkering around in there, I realized that it wasn't the fuse and the bulbs burnt out.  So I whipped out my owners manual and tried to figure out how to change the bulbs - it's not hard, I've done the headlights before- but the tail lights required tools that I did not have in my possession.  I walked into AutoZone and asked them if they could change the bulbs for me and the nice gentleman working the counter told me it was a free service.  The entire process took under 10 minutes and he included some kind of bulb lube (that word makes me lol) to ensure longetivy to the bulbs.    Very quick and painless process.  Makes me wonder what else I can get these guys to do for free.
5 Nice and friendly service. They are always willing to help and giving you the best product that fits your vehicle. I needed coolant for my car, and they were knowledgeable in which product to use. They even suggested if my temp gauge would be the cause so I check it out. So thank you for the excellent service.
