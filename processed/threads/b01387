4 I come here from time to time to get some lunch on weekdays.  There's always a line (which is good cause that means the food isn't sitting out too long- it's being ordered and eaten!) but the employees serve quickly.
5 Ate here 2x yesterday! I had my boyfriend go and pick it up. Great food. Always see people cleaning, asking to help customers, and working like a team!
3 I can't eat gluten anymore so while I used to eat here......now I go for other people who live with me!  It's good, fast and convenient food.  This location is always fresh because it's so busy.  The staff is great and they make Chinese take out less of a chore!  It's all good.
2 Line moving slow. 15 mins to start ordering. Got order in and stood there while 4 people behind me in line were told to check out ahead of me while I waited for one of the 5 people working the line to cut chicken. Then was told an 8 minute wait for egg rolls. I passed at least a dozen restaurants to get here. Next time I'll go to one of those.
5 This is the second time in a row that I have stopped in first time about a month ago approx 2pm this time 830pm. Both visits exceptional! Store is clean (table, chairs, counters) food is ready and good. Service was great with samples offered. It appears "Ping" is in charge and runs a tight ship. I appreciate it, it shows at all levels she cares. Been a long time since I let half my meal get cold to write a review, but they are doing a good job at this location. Thanks Panda at 9th n Bell rd.
