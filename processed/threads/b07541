5 I love QT. This one is great- with the exception of its not in the greatest of neighborhoods and the traffic suck.. The store itself is always clean and well organized.. The employees are very nice and courteous.  AT QT THERE ARE NO LINES!! you just walk up to any register thats open.. its always cool watching the other customers faces when i just walk ahead of them.. anyways This QT is overall good!
3 I haven't been in a QT in years.  Mostly buying Chevron gas and when the desire arises buying stuff in their convenience stores.  They must be doing something right here as the place is packed every time I go by.  Going inside they definitely have a system for hot and cold snacks.  A whole row of coffee urns, another for hot dogs and such. Two cash registers, each working two lines.  They have taken getting people in and out seriously.  I'll probably stop in again for a snack just to get a better feel of what all is in there.
5 Here almost daily. They are always busy but keep the place very clean. Fast friendly service. Parking lot is chaotic but thats the only bad thing, and to be expected being so busy.   Also a safe spot. Not people hanging out front very often.
