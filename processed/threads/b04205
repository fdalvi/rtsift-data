4 I wouldn't go out of my way to hit a Ross store but this happens to be around the corner. Not a bad location for deals. Loaded with some reasonably priced wall clocks and framed prints. Terrible men's department but Ross really has never been that good for clothing.   The locked accessories display is usually filled with low end Armani Exchange but if you happen to hit it at the right time of year, you can find some solid designers at blowout prices. I bought a couple pairs of Oakley Square Whisker polarized for $69.99 - which is a really good deal. I've also found some Smith & Arnette sunglasses as well.
5 Not a bad place to go for a little shopping. I found good deals here. Good customer service.
1 This has to be the worst Ross I've literally ever been to. And I've been to a lot of them.  If you're looking for name brands, forget it. This place is practically barren. There is nothing you will find here that is of any quality.   I went looking for candles and I found smelly, overpriced wax in a jar. I was looking for ANYTHING name brand (because the quality of their other clothes is completely sub-par) and found, you got it, nothing.   I don't know why this store has such prominent front. It's got nothing here. They need to shut it down and bring in a competitor that knows how to stock a store.   Avoid.
