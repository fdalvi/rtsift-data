4 Hot Hooters! Need I say more? I'd come here any day over the ones in NYC.
4 The girls here are great, and fun to talk to if you're not creepy or hitting on them!!!  Love the wings, I come with friends every now and then and have a great time.
5 I absolutely love this Hooters,  Every time I come in with my husband and teenaged son, the waitresses are always so pleasant and helpful.  I love their parmesan chicken wings so I keep going back for more.  Anyone saying that this place is demeaning to women, I say this. No one is forcing you to go here.   Nobody is forcing these girls to work here.  I am sure that these girls make nice tips as they are so friendly to the customers.  I wish a lot of other restaurants in Madison had waitresses half as friendly as the Hooters' girls.  Excellent location just off I-90.  Food has always been good.  It's not gourmet but good for bar food.
5 Ask for Alhena.  She is an experienced Hostess for Hooters and is a great representation of the chain. Bill the manager was making sure every customer was happy.  Service.   5 Food quality.   5 manager.   5
