5 This is MY Avis!  :-)  LOL.  Seriously -- Phylis, the owner of this wonderful establishment, is the BEST!
3 Avis's St. Rose Parkway branch is a small, independently run car rental agency serving the greater.... 7-Hills/Green Valley area. I have only used them a couple of times before and.... it's a typical car rental place.   Prices can range from $$$$$ to dirt cheap but they do try and stay competitive. I guess if you need a rental car for a weekend trip or because your car breaks down, this would be the place to go.
5 This is my go-to when I need to rent a car.  The woman who runs it is very helpful, friendly and accommodating.  The vehicles are always in great condition and I've never had a problem.
