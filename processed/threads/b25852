5 Love this place! I contacted them after getting a quote from a different shop that was way out of our budget. They were VERY accommodating especially on such short notice. I have not yet picked up the shirts but I had to write a review immediately based solely on the amazing customer service at this place. I love that they're a "mom and pop" shop that truly cares about their customers. Plain and simple, this place is wonderful.
5 I'm in a touring band, and I was running out of my shirts fast.  Our next stop was near Mesa, AZ and I looked to Yelp to find good choices.  I like to support independent mom and pop shops that are about quality and service - and American FLC Screenprinting was right on target.  Larry was amazing and recommended better shirts than the ones I was currently carrying.  He pulled an impressive 72 hour turn-around with a large order and threw in a hoodie with my logo on it.  SUCH A GREAT GUY - great product, great service, and even hand delivered it to the venue.  Will definitely be working with them again.  A++++  Would recommend to all.
5 I had some shirts printed recently with some custom art. I gotta say they turned out awesome! I went with the discharge technique and they turned out well. The quality of the print will last for a long time. Working with the staff was seamless. Big thanks for the help Esther and Larry, you guys did great!   -Mohgs
