4 I love this place!  It is so much better than the big chain mail places.  The staff is truly friendly and really care about you as a person, rather than just a customer.  It has a small town feel to it, you can sense it from the moment you walk in the door.  It's personal service with a smile and the care of family.  Not the fanciest but great service!  I've gone there several times to send a fax or send a package, and it's wonderful!  Even though I don't live in Gilbert anymore, I would definitely go out of my way to be a patron of theirs.
4 I pay my rent here. They ship stuff, print money orders, sell stamps and greeting cards. A spritely couple runs the shop and they are extremely kind, if a bit brief in their responses. I guess they send faxes too, but who uses those?
5 Great people to do business with. I've been using them for about 20 years and will continue to use them for all my shipping needs.
