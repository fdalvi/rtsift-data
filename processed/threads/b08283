5 Carpet Medic is absolutely AMAZING and their service is SO friendly.  Just when I think it is time to rip out the carpet due to kids and dogs, the come and make it look brand new again.  They have gotten Paint out of our carpet, unknown Red stains, and left no residue of dog messes.  We LOVE them!!!!
5 Shouts out to Carpet Medic! Dan is fantastic and pretty much came in and saved the day for carpet needing cleaning ASAP. He was helpful, professional and just plain likeable. For instance, he told me Philp would be cleaning our carpets so I wouldn't be surprised it wasn't him knock.   Philip showed up on time and did a great job. He listened to our concerns and went far and beyond our expectations. He conquered old and newer carpets and my mom is delighted with the results.  Unfortunately, all of the stains didn't come out of the old carpet but I don't think anything would have removed those stains besides removing the carpet!   Later that day, Dan called to check on the cleaning and ensure we were happy customers. This sealed my opinion Carpet Medic is a company I can trust and look forward to doing business with again.
5 Carpet Medic is great at what they do.  Dan is the best; reliable, hardworking and implacably honest.  Will definitely do business with them again.
5 We have hired Carpet Medic for several jobs and they ALWAYS show up on time, do the job that they say they will do, and complete for a quoted price. I highly recommend Carpet Medic for your general cleanings and for flooring emergencies!
