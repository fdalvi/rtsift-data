5 This is a MUST SEE Zumba studio! Great sound system, HUGE studio, and plenty of parking! Scheduling of classes is throughout the day...a BIG plus for a 24/7 town! A great team of instructors (check out their website)! Until recently, Vegas offered a limited number of classes during the day and Zumba instructors who are more than aerobic instructors with Latin music!
5 LOVE LOVE LOVE Z Crew Studios!!!! Great way to lose weight & make friends!  Have you been yet???? What are you waiting for....
