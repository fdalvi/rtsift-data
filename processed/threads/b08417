1 This is literally the worst mcdonald's I have ever gone to. In the last week I went to separate times to get an iced coffee before work in the morning. Only to be told that their machine is down for cleaning. Just a hint....AZ is hot at 6:30am and choosing to clean your coffee machines at 6 in the morning is ridiculous....... most people drink coffee when???? THE MORNING!!!
2 It was an ok restaurant, but the service wasn't that great, they didn't pay attention to the customers and one of their machines is broken... which was supposedly also broken in another review.
1 Service here is SLOW. What purpose is two drive thrus if they can't efficiently maintain one?
1 This is the worst McD's we ever been and the slowest. Took them over 15 min to get our food and there weren't even busy. There were couple of other people waiting for their food and seem like they were pissed too because of the slow service and lack of care. There were bunch of young kids working there goofing around. Manager was there but didn't seem to care. AVOID THIS PLACE!!!
3 Last time I went they put way too much salt on my fries. Felt like my mouth was burning :-/
