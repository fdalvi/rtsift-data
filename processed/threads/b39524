5 Nicole has done amazing work capturing gorgeous images of my daughter over the past 2 years from newborn to her 2 year photos just recently.  Each session was more challenging as she has turned in to a spunky toddler, but I always walk away feeling great about the experience and amazed by the photos that I receive!  I am constantly receiving compliments about our daughters photos and questions on who is taking them.  I am beyond excited that Nicole is now on Yelp and that others will be able to experience her unbelievable talent!
5 We love Nicole! Our portraits from an outdoor AZ summer session at a gorgeous location with her, turned out incredible. Everything about the lighting, her vision, and working with my children..perfection! Nicole's experience and knowledge of photography show through her photos. We cherish each one of them:) She is very approachable, professional, and makes the whole experience fun, and most importantly, memorable. I would highly recommend her!
5 If you are looking for an experience with a professional photographer beyond your wildest expectations then you need to book a session with Nicole!  She took our newborn baby girls' photos when she was only 5 days old and did an extraordinarily amazing job! Her expertise, attention to detail, professionalism, and talent is second to none. We were incredibly impressed with how much time Nicole took with us and our daughter. Shooting a newborn takes an incredible amount of patience- from feedings to diaper changes, to soothing her back to sleep, we never felt rushed or uncomfortable.  Nicole made us feel completely at ease and the finished product was nothing short of AMAZING!  We look forward to working with Nicole as our family photographer of choice for many years to come!!! Thanks for being so talented, you truly are the best Nicole!
