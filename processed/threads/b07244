4 If you want pizza, have WIC benefits to redeem, need a bong, jeans or even a single dinner knife this place has it all.  I came here on a tip about good pizza. From the outside I was skeptical, and once I walked in that skepticism increased as I saw a conveyor style oven.  At 4.99 the lunch special of a 10inch 1 topping pizza, soda, and a bread stick is great deal, so I had to try it. Surprisingly the pizza was pretty good especially for a $5 pizza, It is on par or above a papa john's type of pizza. The service was great too.  They did not have their full menu's in yet just a big lunch and dinner specials menu.  In addition to pizza they also have a friend ensemble of zucchini onion rings and more.  There is a big screen TV with cable and dance music playing on the radio. The fountain drink selection is vast but lacks any diet options.  If you are brave and want a solid value give this a try, if you are on a date and want a second one this may not be the best choice.
3 This place has some really good fried chicken. I use to live in the neighborhood a few years back. It's a little market store, but serves some chicken wings and fried chicken that will surprise you. It's located in the hood, so pack your favorite weapon...he...he.... if you find yourself on Buckeye, it's worth the stop.
4 This is the type of place that when you drive by you would NEVER stop in, its a small small market that caters to WIC and food stamp people in the surrounding ghetto.  I work down the street and one day when driving by i saw a sign pop up that said "Pizza & Wings" and since i LOVE pizza we took the chance with our life and stopped in.   The guys who work there are awesome and friendly.  The pizza is awesome, they make their own down and sauce, and all of the meats are BEEF based since they have a lot of Muslim customers.  I've been back tons of times and they have catered a few work lunches for us too!
