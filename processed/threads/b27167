5 Amy K Music Co. offers a slew of music lessons.  I've been taking guitar instruction for just a month and am really pleased with my weekly classes.  Price is fair, instructor is relaxed, very helpful and goes at my pace.  Scheduling lessons is pretty flexible and if you get on their web site, you can print out a 15% off coupon for the first month of lessons.  Their flexibility and professionalism is really refreshing after a really bad experience I had with another guitar instructor in the valley.
4 I learned about Amy K Music from a groupon offer. I started taking violin lessons after a 15 yr break. I couldn't be happier-my instructor Laura is incredibly patient and full of great feedback. My childhood teacher was a stuffy lady stuck in the stone ages, so it's refreshing to take lessons from a person in my age group. I have nothing to compare the pricing to since my lessons as a kid were in public school in NJ (and were free). They are certainly are flexible with time and scheduling. The office space is a tad, creepy is about the most negative thing I can say. the place needs some paint and some cheering up. All in all very happy with my lessons.
5 My daughter takes guitar and piano lessons here. They are kind caring instructors and teach based on the way each individual learns. I would highly recommend them for private music lessons.
