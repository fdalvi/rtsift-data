5 I'm giving this review from the perspective of a pipe smoker. I was doing research on the culture around pipe smoking and got into pipe smoking myself in order to get firsthand knowledge.  As a woman, I am   more of a rare breed when it comes to pipe smoking (though there are plenty of women pipe smokers) and I found that some tobacco sellers wouldn't give me the time of day- I think maybe they didn't take me seriously.  I also found that some tobacco sellers who claim to cater to pipe smokers will then show you a terrible, dried out, unlabeled collection of who-knows-what that they can't even describe.   But Mr. Bill's is different.   I found their selection of pipe tobaccos to be well cared for: properly stored and nicely labeled.  They have a good variety, and the staff were always friendly, willing to answer my questions, and would make suggestions for tobaccos to try.    I was able to buy small amounts of tobacco to sample (sometimes they'd give me a free sample) rather than making me buy a larger amount that would just go to waste if I didn't like it.    If they gave me a free sample, I always made sure to purchase something as a thank you- they have pipes ranging from cheap corncobs to meerschaums to nicely carved wood ones, and you can buy your tampers, pipe cleaners, etc. here as well.  Good job, Mr. Bill's!  If I were a regular pipe smoker I'd choose Mr. Bill's over the other local shops.
4 Nice pleasent atmo... resonable prices... cigars are usually fresh... novlety gifts are cute... No one really stands out for a 5 star  review... I now need someone to impress me before they get 5 stars... oh yelp... I have been jaded
5 Wow!  What great customer service.  I ordered on Monday, got thank you e-mails for signing up and ordering.  Got the items on Thursday with a hand-written thank you!  Doesn't get any better than that
2 Perhaps I expected a bit too much based upon their radio ads, which hyped them as the best in town, or at least among the best. I went in looking for cigars, and I found a paltry selection with unremarkable prices. Shelf space in the humidor which could have been used for premium cigars was wasted on machine-made brands you can buy at most any convenience store. I was very disappointed, and I haven't been back. Maybe the experience is better if cigars aren't what you're after. If you want stogies there are far better choices.
