2 La Salsa has been a safe bet for vegetarians and folks looking wholesome fast-food. But this La Salsa Catina inside a mall was dire. The service was fairly ok. But the food was poor. The pizza veggie with black beans tasted as bad as it sounds ;) My sizzling chicken fajitas were ok, but overall we left feeling we should've gone somewhere else.  Damn those vegetarians - it's sooo difficult to take them anywhere! Please eat eggs, fish or seafood...else bring a picnic of straw :)
1 We found ourselves tooling through the forum shoppes one day on our recent trip to LV around lunchtime.  I had been craving Mexican, so we of course we stopped to check the mall Directory and voila!  We see La Salsa!  I was so excited!!  Little did I know............  It looked so cute when we went inside and then we noticed a great outdoor patio with a bar.  I think this must be the attraction, margaritas outside, that allows them to continue to stay in the forum shoppes and make money.  B/c our food was dire, bland, tasteless and all around the worst Mexican food I have ever had.  And I do not say this lightly, I truly am the last person to be overly critical b/c every restaurant can have a bad day.  But this food was insipid and terrible-- PLEASE do not eat here.  There are so many other options, I wish we had taken one of them instead.
1 I got sick from their food. I should have read their yelp reviews before deciding to have lunch here.  My girlfriend got the fish tacos and asked for no cheese (lactose intolerant). They brought the dish out with cheese. So we apologized and let them know that she is is allergic to cheese and needed the dish to be remade. The server said, "ok, we'll make a new dish"  A few minutes later, they brought the dish out. It had one sliver of cheese on it and messy sauce on top. They had just removed the cheese instead of making a new dish!!  So we notified the manager. If she just didn't like cheese or couldn't have it for a silly reason, we would have let it pass. But, she cannot have the slightest bit of dairy... so we took it seriously.   I don't recommmend this place. Go get an Auntie Anne's pretzel instead :)
3 We stopped here for a quick dinner on Saturday night...the place was empty! Now, I'm use to the La Salsa back in San Diego that is a fast food place, so this seemed pretty pricey to me for basically the same food. My husband had the Fajita Quesadilla and I had the chicken burrito. Both we good but not excellent. We also ordered the chips and salsa (which I hated paying $2.50 for...who doesn't give free chips!!) and I had a strawberry margarita which was decent. It was an okay dinner, but not worth the $$!
1 Blech. Similar to some of my other Vegas reviews, this place will unfortunately be subject to scrutiny over the one thing I ordered from it. My friends and I all got the $20 giant margaritas (which are about 17" tall, for those curious), and we all regretted it. Extremely heavy on the syrup and not heavy at all on the liquor. No one finished their drink, and we all stopped taking gulps of grossly sour slush at about the same point in our enormous souvenir cups. And the sad thing was, we weren't even buzzed in the slightest to show for it. So even though you see folks strutting around with their huge margaritas...your money is better spent elsewhere =).
3 Came here after shopping because me and my friends we're starving! The food was alright and it was kinda weird how they charged extra for chips and salsa because usually restuarants give that stuff for free. The waiters were pretty nice me and my friends were pretty loud and some were buzzed! Cute place but the food is just average.
1 This - like most things I found on the Vegas strip - was watered down, fake, and overpriced.   There was a supposed happy hour. What's that you say? You'd like a margarita? You'd like a happy hour margarita? Oh you can only have that if it's frozen.   Wait, what? I can only get a 'happy hour' priced margarita if it's frozen, if I get the exact same drink on the rocks it's $6 extra? Wtf. Just so you can cheat me out of alcohol? Lame.   The drinks were horrible, watered down, and not worth any money really. The food was bland. We had to pay of course for salsa and chips.   Our server was nice but not necessarily attentive.  All in all though - what can you really expect from a chain mexican restaurant in ceasars palace? I should have known what we were getting into.
2 Damn, this place is overpriced. I got two burritos and a couple of drinks and the bill was $65!!!! Are you kidding me?? Then, I ordered a yard drink to go, and I swear, there was NO alcohol in it. I am a lightweight so I should have been drunk drinking the entire thing, but I drank it and didn't get drunk. Really?? The upside of this place is that the servers are really nice and the food is decent, but everything else about this place pissed me off.
2 Not only is this place ridiculously overpriced for the campy Miracle Mile, but it's thoroughly mediocre. I ordered a carnitas burrito which tasted like steamed chicken and tomato paste. The tortilla had the consistency of moist clay...very unappetizing for the price.   Adding insult to injury, three waiters kept pressuring me with questions the entire time; "Would you like another drink, sir?" "Isn't there anything else we can get for you, sir?" Their cloying attitude made me feel like I was at a strip mall theme restaurant, but what else can one expect with a description like "Mexican fare." Indeed, that's exactly what you'll get here: far below "cuisine" and just short of "food."
4 Hmm... all less than 3 stars huh... I wonder if this is the same one I am talking about.   But regardless... they get 4 from me cause I bought one drink... ya you know those tall ones - Yard Stick. Yaaa... that one. And it had me buzzing. Thank you Miss Brandi for such a magnificent drink. Never had I tasted such a powerful and pungent Long Island Iced Tea.   Viva La Salsa Cantina!
4 I got those Yard drink things.  I was super happy.   I got a great vegetarian burrito and side of rice bean beans.  I was quite content.  4 stars instead of 5?   The price KILLED me.  For how much I paid, I could have fed a family of 3 for everywhere else in the world.  But it is Las Vegas.
2 Well I had my heart set on mexican one evening when we were in Vegas. My husband and I decided to try La Salsa Cantina. I had the burrito while he had the chimichunga. We both drank margaritas and lets just say that they margaritas were SOOOO much better than the food. We have a local mexican chain here in town (Columbus) that is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better than this place. I was really disappointed. It almost seemed like they forgot to season the food at La Salsa Cantina. What a disappointment in food and price.  Also, the food is WAY overpriced here too. Go elsewhere!!!
4 In addition to eating at the other location, we also visited this location twice in early September.  We only had drinks and snacks here in the evening.  I had margaritas, made w/ patron for $7.99.  They were very good drinks.  We had chips and salsa w/ them.  They were good and not too pricy.  They were bottomless so they just hit the spot w/ our drinks.  We had the same server twice.  He was a very nice guy.  I checked out the menu and want to have dinner here sometime.  I had breakfast at the other location and it was great.
1 Paying $18 for THE worst burrito i've ever had?  my fault.  Inexcusably horrible service for an hour and a half?  your fault.   Don't get it twisted, get Chipotle.
4 * I don't know if this is the page for the La Salsa that I went to, since there is another one on Yelp nearby. *  For something on the Strip, expect it to be pricey, of course. However, a sign outside that said "2 FOR 1 CORONAS" caught my eye, so that drew me in. The prices are a bit higher than I would normally pay for Mexican food. However, the food was seemingly a lot better than I had expected. The burrito ranchero I ordered burst with the fillings when I cut into it. I got it with carnitas, which I am glad I did, because the meat was great. In the end, our group ordered three entrees and 4 Coronas for the price of 2, and our bill was just under $60. I guess we got lucky and got the better quality service, because I really can't complain about anything during our visit.
2 **Went May 31st**  This place was ok, food was quickly made service was alright. I didn't like my burrito much, it made my tummy hurt, I really enjoyed my soda & the nachos could have been MUCH better; I've had better at Denny's.   I'd skip it next time more than likely.
1 Kids wanted Mexican......sooooo glad we got a discount offer for this place. I would've been UPSET if I had to pay full price for their "mexican food."  I know it's a chain, but it wasn't good at all.....  Service SUCKED!  Had to wait to be seated.......wait to get drinks ordered........wait to get food ordered.  Our server was MIA, someone else took our order & brough it out to us.  Other staff got our drinks....our server only checked on us once or twice.  We were starving.....ate what we could and left!  Never will we go back!! Sooooo many better places to try.....stay away!!
3 Stopping at this place for quick and cheap frozen margaritas was exactly what we needed after walking around for a few hours in the desert heat.   We only stopped in because we got a card for 2 for 1 frozen drinks during happy hour. I can't complain - the outdoor bar had mist spraying each of the chairs at the bar and 2 margaritas were $10 - you can't beat that in Vegas!
2 This was was just ok. Not particularly great. I think Rubio's and Baja Fresh are way better thant his place and have much cheaper prices. BUT.. I had been stubborn to try this place many times b/c of the great music that I hear them playing at the location on the strip. However, on this day about 2 wks ago we were walking the miracle mile shops at hours when they shops were actually open! LOL. We alwys end up here to get a refill for my drink @ Fat Tuesdays when I feel like being a tourist.   PHOTOS: You cant seem to go to a rest. on the strip w/out beign offered a photo. Well here they took a complimentry photo of us and then offered to sell us a larger one for amt. I think around $10 each. Um, no thanks. I'm @ La Salsa.. not Top of the World or the Paris restaurant.  APPETIZER: Well the chips and salsa is what we ordered. My bf jokingly said... we ordered "CHIPS and salsa...not broken pieces and salsa" Every chip was broken!! IT was like they gave us the crumbs at the bottom of the santitas bag that everyone throws away b/c its not worth trying to find one that you can actually use to pick up any salsa. And IF you do manage to get some you end up w/ it all over ur fingers. BLah!  ENTREE: I ordered the avocado chicken enchilada. which is new on the menu. it tasted ok.. but the chicken wasnt shredded like I thought it would be = and the avocado was basically whole. I asked the waiter if the guacamole had onions, he said yes. SO. I asked for it on the side. He brought it and to my surprise..delightfully, it had no onions! yay!!!!  IT was delicious. way good. thats why they get 2 stars. no thanks to my uninformative waiter. and the dish said that it came with red or green chile sauce. I asked for red. My dish came with neither. VERY DRY. So. the took my plate away and gave me a new one that had sauce. just enough to be painted on. well it was better than no sauce.   We didnt order any drinks b/c at those prices and calories, didnt really feel like I needed any. that.. and we'd already shared a cookie @ toll house down the isle..and wow. .that was a million times better than this place! In fact that was the highlight of the day that afternoon... :) try the cookie!
2 The only reason I give this 2 stars is because the food was pretty good.  Now the bad.  First my friend and I sat at the bar to get something to eat, sat there about ten minutes, the bartender didn't even look at us. but we were there so we just opted to get a table instead. It was about 10:50 and we wanted lunch food.  WRONG. lunch there, for whatever reason, doesn't start until 11:00 on the dot. What's up with that??? and also once we got a table, it took a while to have a waitress come over to take our order. I will not be going there again.
2 I went here as opposed to the food court next door to it on the strip but was not in love by any means. The food was very mediocre. My party and I got two cali burritos and a two taco plate. It was medium priced which is expected for a place on the las vegas strip. The burritos had hardly any avocado and were just not that good. They charged us for a small thing of salsa and the meals came with no chips.  Service was lacking, our waitress was blah, a very unenthusiastic guy asked to take a picture of us as some promotion (way to try get money), and the ambiance was poor. At first glance it seemed cool, lots on the wall, but we were seated in a booth that had almost no lighting. The music was random also, it didn't set the mood at all. It wasnt a one star experience, it was just far farfarrrrr from amazing. Wouldn't go back and am surprised its there.
1 This one was located at the Miracle Mile. The service was great. We were seated quickly and the waitress was nice, but.....   I ordered the fish tacos.    Never again.  I was served two tacos with one over overcooked tiny fish stick in each taco. Even the rice and beans were awful. I've had better Rice a Roni spanish rice.  For good cheap fish tacos go to Rubios !!!!
4 Stopped in here on a tuesday in january for a yard drink. The bartender was awesome, just a really nice and cool genuine chick. She poured us two strong margos in the yard cups. My girlfriend had a blended mango margo and I went for the top shelf on the rocks. We also had an order of nachos. The bill came out to around $55 with a tip. I was not expecting much from this place and it turned out to be a great value. Those yard drinks are prolly like 5-6 regular drinks so for 16-20 bucks its a great deal. One negative would be the hostess who what quite the little prissy b***ch I felt like throwing my yard margo on her. Theres bad apples everywhere.
4 I would give it 5 stars, but we only ate chips & salsa. We stopped here however because we saw a sign for a $5 bloody mary. We went in to the bar & found ourselves being waited on by Brandon, whom had worked there for 5 years. He was super friendly & made us killer drinks as well as provided us with some good conversation & entertainment. He also gave us great information on where we should go out & where not to waste our time. He deserves his tips by far!
3 Ehhh the one good thing about this place is their location if you dine outside, people watching through the Miracle Mile.  We came here right after doing dune buggies and we were starved. We were kind of disappointed when we heard they were only serving breakfast, but we dealt. Both ordered the Mexican Scrambled [My friend who is Mexican makes it soooo much better!] but it was satisfying enough.   Now, the drinks. We had come here for drinks a few days before and they were good. But that morning, I ordered a Mimosa and he ordered a Bloody Mary. We shouldnt have expected much coming from a Tex Mex restaurant, but really.. how can you mess up a mimosa?! its only champagne and orange juice... mind you, their orange juice had PULP. Ugh. Ive had plenty of mimosa's and never had pulp in it. Maybe Im wrong, I dont know. And his Bloody Mary was veryyy very ketchupy [Working in the restaurant business, I have made plenty of Bloody Marys and they never tasted like that] But all in all, if you want somewhere to eat thats convenient with decent food, I guess you could go here. But I heard Cabo Wabo is better [wishh we would have went there]
3 We were starving so we just headed into La Salsa. It was pretty good. I got the Mexican Pizza appetizer with shrimp. The pizza was pretty big for an appetizer too. The shrimp wasn't that good. The service was friendly and fast. We ordered 4 shots of patron, they brought us something else that tasted like Jose Cuevo. Probably wouldn't come back to a La Salsa in Vegas.
1 I was in the mood for Mexican and immediately when I saw this place, my boyfriend and I decided to check it out.  We both were disappointed.  First, our waitress took awhile to ask us what we wanted to drink.  Then, we stated we needed additional time to look at the menu and I kid you not, she gave us 30 second (no joke) and came back to see if we were ready.  We stated no, we needed a few minutes, and she came back 1 minute later, and we just kinda looked at her confused, why was she rushing us to order?  Then, we made our decision, closed our menus and waited over 15 minutes for her to take our order (and the restaurant was not business).  You have to pay for Chips and Salsa - which was so-so.  I ended up ordering a Steak Burrito and it came with Rice/Beans.  The rice and beans were not tasty and the burrito was stuffed with the same rice and beans and barely any meat.  Did not enjoy.  Also, our waitress never came to the table to ask us for refills or even for the bill.  After finishing our meal, we probably waited 15-20 minutes before flagging her down asking for the bill.  Mind you it still was not busy.  I will definitely not be back to this restaurant.
3 Came here for something to absorb all the booze we drank throughout the evening. We settled on nachos & were told by our friendly waiter that it was big enough to share. It sure was! It really hit the spot for us and we were glad that we picked here to eat. I would come back since the nachos were very good and the people watching was even better!
4 Good Mexican place in the Planet Hollywood shops.  Food was quite good.   It was a bit odd that they charged extra for some more salsa.  Would eat at again.
1 Went here on a Sunday afternoon.  Waitress took order and brought drinks.  Did not offer refills (or really come back to our table) until the bill was presented.  Ordered a burrito that was $1 worth of meat and cheese, a greasy tortilla, and some black beans.  If you ask for salsa, they will charge you a buck for it (but not tell you until you get the bill).  The food is waaay overpriced, and I would avoid it like the sickness that you will most likley get in the form of food poisoning (which most of our party did.. since we did not have anything else that day to eat or drink except our meal here).  AVOID THIS PLACE!!!
3 Was out with a party of four looking to kill an hour before a show at the nearby V Theater. This place fit the bill. We just wanted drinks and appetizers and that's what we got.  The decor in this place is kinda weird. Holes in the drywall, chairs and tables splattered with paint, not exactly the look of a Mexican cantina unless you want it to look like it's under construction.  Service was good. We were seated right away. The hostess, waiter, and 100 year old busboy were friendly and helped add to the atmosphere.   My wife and I split a couple pitchers of Dos Equis they had on special for 12.95. Our guests had a couple top shelf margaritas that they said were "top shelf" and the prices were good compared to other Mexican cantinas in Vegas. We also split a Cantina sampler that was a mixed bag. It was nachos, quesadillas, taquitos and chicken wings. The wings were small but had good flavor. The quesedillas were tasty (my wife and I devoured them), and the taquitos weren't bad, similar to what I've had at Chili's. The nachos? um, no. These tasted as if they were served earlier in the evening, sat out on someone else's table for an hour or so, brought back to the kitchen and microwaved before serving to us. Seriously, these were bad. Some of the nachos were soggy and cold, others were still warm but dried out.   When we got the check we noticed they charged for chips and salsa. Really? Before we could sit down we were asked if we wanted chips and salsa on the table. Ok. sure. Would you also like guacamole? sure. When we killed the bowl of chips they asked if we wanted more. Sure!  So we got charged for 2 orders of chips and salsa plus guacamole. I can understand the guacamole, apparently it is a standard upcharge in Vegas cantinas but chips and salsa? Everywhere else we have tried, they have been free. Some places just seem desperate to make a buck.  The bathroom needed to be cleaned and I noticed several dirty tables toward the back of the restaurant that no one bothered to clear off while we were there. I am guessing the 100 year old busboy was still making his way there. That did not help add to the atmosphere.  Would I stop here again? Yes. I would avoid the nachos though.
3 This La salsa is located inside of the Planet Hollywood  I've only been here once @ lunch time, i got the Grande Burrito w/ carnitas, with rice and black beans. it tasted fine, tho i was just going for a quick lunch and i wasn't expecting fireworks.   My boyfriend got a combination plate of some sort, he however was less impressed.   They charge separately for chips and salsa ($2.50) (not uncommon of the strip) and the Salas's weak and bland in flavor.  I'd like to try one of their margaritas by the yard. org fruit 18.95/ top shelf 24.95 and 1.95 for an extra shot.
3 Always seem to have a good meal here! The there is nothing "Amazing" about the food, but the service is always great. The cost isn't that bad considering you are located in the heart of the strip... If your up to it, try any of the margaritas as they make a top notch drink. I do like Cabo Wabo better, but this is pretty good!
1 Avoid this place like the plague it's double the price of a regular La Salsa ( they even charge you for chips and salsa really seriously). The waitress barely spoke English and you could hardly understand her. She took the order then she was MIA she never came to check on us. To the extent that we had to get another server to refill our drinks and get the bill. LaSalsa you should be ashamed to be employing such a low caliber of employee!!!
5 best place on the strip for locals!!   semi-cheap drinks and good music. do not eat the food here!!! no bueno.
3 For the family, we went to the La Salsa Cantina location located in Planet Hollywood on the main shopping level, Miracle Mile for a quick bite. The restaurant is located in the back of the mall, so it is a little bit of a walk to get back there.  The 3 of us ordered different selections and each were good.  Unlike their other location at near the M&M factory, they charge for chips and salsa.  Overall, the food was affordable and clean.  The service was okay.
4 Love the salsa selection they give you and some great queso. The fish tacos was very good. Small place and was too hot to eat outside (dead of summer) but I imagine on nicer days, that would be great.
1 overpriced, small portions. There's far better food for the same price range.
1 This used to be our go-to for yardstick-length margaritas because they sold them for much cheaper than everyone else - BUT NOT ANYMORE! We pretty much paid for double this last time. I even got double shots, and didn't taste anything in mine, while my husband's was pretty strong (I think that happened last time too). It was making me sick and I ended up tossing mine. Ugh, never again!
3 Stopped in here with a group of guys during a bachelor party.  Food: It's nothing special, Just Ok.  Price: Expensive for that kind of food, don't drink here or you will pay for it later!  The server we had couldn't split our bills in to individual bills, so she kindly told us that she had to group us together. What a bunch of bull, never heard such a thing. Then the bill comes and we had tip added on...  Not much atmosphere, kind of dark, and just OK food. Service is OK.  Go next door to Cheeseburger Cheeseburger....
2 Service was one step above a cafeteria, drinks were ok. My food was good but My friend got food poisoning after eating here. Beware of the re-fried beans... not only here but anywhere you eat them!
4 We've been here 3 times in the past two days. Twice for breakfast and once for drinks. The breakfast is priced just right for those that don't want to pay an arm and leg to eat. The food was great and that's what brought us back. We stopped by for drinks one night and enjoyed the atmosphere. Two locations on the strip. One in the Miracle Mile Shops and the other further down the strip. Good food and good drinks while in Vegas.
3 I had a very expensive margarita here. I just wanted the experience of walking down the street with a drink, LOL. So I chose a $21 margarita. It was good, but not the best I've had. I finished about 3/4 of it, then tossed it after it melted. Oh well. My husband had a draft Dos Equis--this was the only draft the bar had!  We were a little surprised, but he was fine with it. It looked like a nice little place to get something to eat and drink.
3 My wife and I had breakfast twice at the Miracle Mile location in Las Vegas. We both ordered the $3.95 breakfast and were happy to find one of the few places that is open for breakfast in the Miracle Mile before 8 AM - it is Vegas Baby. My wife  ordered the eggs with sausage and I had the ham variation. The sausage was a patty rather than links, which my wife prefers. Included were southwestern style potatoes and choice of corn or flour tortillas. Both breakfasts were adequate and a deal in Vegas. Service was friendly and prompt - at 7:15AM :)
2 Meh....not a huge fan of this place. Just another tex-mex style restaurant for tourists. I had the fish tacos and they came out cold. The chips and salsa were the best part of my experience. I will try out other places when I come back to Planet Hollywood.
4 Wanted Mexican food and have eaten at the one in Planet Hollywood and loved it.  This one was not as good as the one in PH, but it was good.  We ordered chips and salsa for the table, which came with 4 different salsas.  I liked the mild and hot red salsas the best.  The food everyone got was great.  Service was quick, ambiance was a little boring inside where we ate.
1 Skip this place!!!  Strawberry margarita is in a 16oz glass that's $13 and just tasted like a sugary strawberry slushy. I asked where the alcohol was and the waitress just said its because you ordered strawberry flavored. Ummm, no. She wanted to charge $1 extra for another shot. So, I just cancelled and ordered water.   My food: a flavorless steak taco with a chicken enchilada that tasted like it was frozen.  Overall: overpriced and most importantly not good! :(
4 Its took almost 3 years, but I finally made it back to Vegas and got La Salsa Cantina's famous mango margarita.  The drink was $11, but for the size and taste it was well worth it.
5 The $3.95 breakfast and $.99 bloody Mary's pulled us in. It was very good. We ate breakfast for $13 which is awesome on Vegas! Food was tasty. Service was wonderful! For breakfast, its a good decision!
5 Manny is a great bartender!.
4 Great place to go to if you want mexican food in vegas! Staff is friendly and the food is good. Try to get their before 11 am for their breakfast special. Their breakfast is really good!
1 How are you going to name a resturant LA SALSA and charge for chips and salsa. The one and only mexican restaurant I have been to that charges for chips and salsa. The one with THAT name should be the first to not charge for chips and salsa. So don't go to NO SALSA!! It's the principal...
4 I was at the restaurant next to M&M World. We loved the 2/6.00 Corona's, the. 99 bloody Marys and the 3.95 breakfast special (2 eggs 2 Bacon or sausage, 2 flour tortillas and a mound of potatoes. Very good food there... we went 4 of the 5 days in Vegas. Vegas us ridiculously expensive and this place was a great find.
2 La Salsa in California is a take out fast food type place that at least has a self serve salsa bar with a few 'fresh' salsa choices. My friends and I ate at La Salsa Cantina on the strip and couldn't believe our quesadillas came with chips and sour cream...but no salsa. We asked for salsa and it appeared we had asked for shredded black truffles so we said we'll take an order of chips and salsa; that seemed to compute better and btw also costs $2.95. Problem solved? No! We finally got salsa and we all ate it at the same time and said the same thing....' It tastes like a jar of salsa from the supermarket'. Come on now! The name of the establishment has the word salsa in it!!!!
1 The only reason I am giving it 1 star is because of the service. Food is definitely overpriced at about $20 plate. Drinks are fairly overpriced averaging about $15 a pop (I am factoring in this is La Salsa and not some high end club). Food tasted like flavorless wannabe Mexican food. Don't go there unless you have to. It's not like your traditional La Salsa, it's the red headed step child that no one wants.
2 We have been in Vegas since Sunday and this was the second time we ate here. I was pretty skeptical because of the reviews but by the time I saw them, we'd already been seated inside.  Trip 1 was for dinner. The restaurant was pretty empty but the service was excellent and so was the food. I had a chicken fajita burrito with rice and beans on the side. It was delicious. I thought the reviews were wrong. The only negative was the pricing seemed a little high.   Wellllll, trip 2 was the absolute opposite experience. We went for breakfast this time. They drew us in with 99 cent bloody marys. They were good... Had to order doubles so they came in a standard glass and not a kiddie cup.    The service was slow (and slow is being nice). Our waitress was horrible. It took at least 10 minutes for her to even come over after we were seated. We ordered our drinks and she asked for our IDs. I was having trouble finding mine in my purse and our drinks came out before she came back to look at the ID which I thought was funny. It should have been a clue as to how "on top of things" she'd be.   Anyway, we ordered food and once the food came, she brought our bill, told us to let her know if we needed anything else, and scurried off before we could order another round and ask her to separate our checks.  She didn't come back for at least 15 minutes and that's no exaggeration. At that point, she tried to take our bill -- which had no payment in it because we weren't finished. We ordered our second round and requested out bills be separated. The waitress told us that she would need to find the manager to do that and acted as if it was a major inconvenience.  Again, she didn't come back for about 15 minutes. In the mean time, I watched her dig in the trash can on two separate occasions looking for things she'd thrown away.... Who knows if she washed her hands.   She finally saw me staring at her and I guess she remembered we needed our bills. She brought them and since I paid with my card, she wanted to see my ID again. I really couldn't have gotten out of there any faster.  It was a terrible experience.  The only reason I rated this place two stars and not one was because of the dinner experience.
5 Idk why this place has such a bad rating. I would never come here for a romantic dinner, but for a quick lunch this place was perfect! Of course the prices are high it's right on the strip, but they have a Groupon that helped. They also have someone come around and take a picture of your table, you get a free postcard pic even if you don't buy the framed pic they try to sell you. Not that exciting but it was fun. The food was good and they breaded the fish for my tacos even tho it wasn't on the menu. Plus I heard they have 99 cent bloody Mary's for breakfast, what!
1 With the restaurant more than half empty during dinner service, I would expect service to be exceptionally faster. After we were seated, we waited for the wait staff to offer us a drink (which is instantaneous in most restaurants) or ask what we'd like to eat. We got neither after waiting more than 5 minutes. We then left.
3 Came here for a quick meal before a night of partying it up =D  Overall enjoyed the food.  Service started out great but ended after we got our food.  No one checked in one us for the last half hour of our meal, and had to flag down someone to ask for our check.    The food was pretty expensive for a 'la salsa' restaurant, but that may have been because we were in Vegas (prime location - inside the Miracle Mile Shoppes).  We paid approximately $90 including tip for 2 entrees, and 2 drinks which is pretty unreasonable for a fast food chain restaurant.  Other than the price, and the long wait for our check...everything else was satisfactory.
2 nice lil spot if you come with someone who like to dance to salsa..... not my favorite spot in the world .... I was not to fond of the way they speak to guest I know they deal with a lot of drunk ass people but you should still have a sense of good character...  Tips: go to the bar and order yourself , waitresses are rude and take forever to get you served.
3 Had the $3.95 breakfast and was very happy with it.  The special runs til noon every day, including weekends.  It's 2 eggs, breakfast potatoes, 2 warm tortillas and your choice of breakfast meat. Kind of hard to beat.  They also have $1 small bloody mary's before noon.  Our server was slow but he did have a lot of tables.  Our food took longer than the table beside us, even though we'd ordered a good 5-10 minutes before them...but I can't complain about the food portion size, which was generous, and the very cheap price.  It was a tasty, standard breakfast, and I'd recommend it for those traveling through.    I can't speak to the lunch or dinner items though...
1 Out celebrating our friends 1 year wedding anniversary, I wanted a margarita. After checking out a few places we settled on this place. We stood forever at the hostess stand waiting to be seated. Finally a girl came over and took us to a table and gave us menus. Priced at $12.50 (regularly priced $17.50 when not on special) I ordered a strawberry "Margarita-by-the-Yard" and I couldn't taste any alcohol at all. Our friends couldn't taste any in theirs either, so we asked our server when she finally came back around if we could buy some shots to add to it. She said they are $1 per shot so I ordered 2 shots to add to mine. The margarita seemed like it was mostly ice and I just didn't care for it.  I figured with salsa being in the name of this place that we would get the standard complimentary chips and salsa, but nope! Chips and salsa cost here! I decided to just order a "Mexican Pizza" priced at $7.95 to munch on. It was a flour tortilla that had a crunch to it with pinto beans, cheese, salsa and sour cream. The beans weren't very warm and tasted bland. Honestly the fresh avocado was the only good part about it. Maybe if their margaritas actually gave people a buzz the food would taste better!   Our server wasn't great about checking on us and slow with bringing out our drinks and food. She carded us when we ordered the drinks, but then carded our friend 2 more times and he didn't even order but one drink that he was already carded for. She seemed a bit spacey. I didn't mind the prices at all, but wasn't satisfied with my drink, food or the service we recieved. I can
3 Last day of our stay in Vegas for a catering convention and came to the shops to hang out till we got picked up for our trip to the airport. Had a hankering for Mexican.   I ordered the fish taco beef taco combo and it was good. Nothing to write home about but was flavorful and the steak wasn't tough.   A good end to a nice vegas trip
5 Okay, if you're in Vegas eating on a budget.... I would HIGHLY suggest stopping in for at least breakfast! I think we paid 3.95 for eggs, your choice of either ham, bacon, or sausage, potatoes and fresh tortillas. How do you go wrong with that? Everything tasted delicious too... Maybe that's because we started drinking at 6am... Hahaha  They do have 99 cent bloody marys during breakfast too... So it's definitely a smart spot for a breakfast adult beverage.  It can get packed in here, but even so, we were greeted quickly. Our food took a little longer to get to us, but for a complete meal under 10 dollars including tip out you can't be too picky. Making this a pit stop every time in Vegas!
5 Was not expecting Mexican food to be this good in vegas! I will definitely eat hear the next time where in town.
