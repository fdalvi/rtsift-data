1 While the food may be reasonably priced, you get what you pay for. We ordered 4 different entrees, only the egg fu yung was anywhere near good. The sesame chicken was dry and stringy. The chop suey and mongolian chicken looked identical and used the same sauce. The mongolian chicken was just spicier. The gravy for the egg fu yung was the same sauce that was with the chop suey, etc. I guess if you haven't eaten decent chinese food then this stuff might be considered good. But for my taste it was terrible and I would certainly take a pass on this restaurant. Tom's Red Pepper is not too far away from China Kitchen and, while not the best, it is far better than this.
4 As time winds down before I head back to Seoul, I think about some of the things I will miss about Madison, especially certain restaurants. And one of those restaurants is China Kitchen, a fast-food Chinese restaurant on the west side of Madison specializing more on take-out than sit-in dining (but they recently did add 2 more tables for a total of 3). Even with my new diet and exercise routine, this is one of my guilty pleasures that I still cannot shake even after living off Chinese food my entire college career. The reason why? They make pretty decent dishes at more than reasonable prices. My faves are kung pao chicken, general tso's chicken, broccoli beef, and chicken w garlic sauce. I am in no way saying that this place ranks in the upper echelon of great Chinese food (check out Fugu downtown), but if you want decent food that is fast, efficient, and fair, then this is your place.  It's also nice that being a regular customer for more than a year now, the owners and I have developed a sort of routine or understanding of how I like my food. I took some pics for your viewing satisfaction.
