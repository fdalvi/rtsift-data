4 I was here for the 2nd day of their soft opening. The food is EXCELLENT. Although they are still working out ticket times, the wait staff were amazing. Amanda really knew her wines and wine pairings.   The wine list is amazing and comprehensive. There are LOTS of wines by the bottle. I'd like to see more diverse wines by the glass, including another Zinfandel selection.   The menu was that of a typical steakhouse with a variety of different cuts and sizes. I got the filet which was perfectly cooked. Beware - if you order a sauce they do not serve it on the side, they put it right on the steak. You can also get your steak cooked with a special rub seasoning too.   Ordered some sides, including the wild rice, which was very wild! If you like unusual wild rice - go for it!  All in all, I see great potential with Rare Steakhouse. It is in a great location (across from the Capital), has great food, and good knowledgeable servers!   I recommend this establishment and I will come back. Give it a try!
5 By far the best steak house in town! I had an amazing meal all around with amazing service! Overall this is a great dining expirence!
5 The steaks are SUPERB. Shared the 24oz porter house with my date. I do wish I would've asked for sauce on side. Excellent wine choices. I have to agree this is one of the best steak houses. Can't wait to go back.
