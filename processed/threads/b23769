5 A Child's Place has been a G-Dsend for me!  They accepted my autistic son with open arms when other daycares wouldn't.  They then helped him get officially diagnosed and provide resources to help him further.  They worked with his speech and occupational therapists and the entire staff was genuinely concerned about him.  They celebrated when he showed improvement.  I would not have been able to complete my degree or work without knowing that my children were in a stable, loving environment that ACP provided.  My younger son was excited to tell me about his art projects every day and will tell me his colors and animals and feelings now.  All things that he learned at ACP.  The owner, Ms Kristine is on the Higley School Board and has the biggest passion and heart for children.  Her passion shows through every time you speak to her.  I can not say enough good things about this daycare.  I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a loving, educational, secure, caring environment for their babies.
5 I have known the owners of A Child's Place at the Ranches for several years now and have seen first hand the care and attention that the staff provides for their students.  I would highly recommend them for child care services for families in the area.
5 I've known the owners at A Child's Place at The Ranches for two years.  I also had the  pleasure of touring the facility.  It's clear that the owners and staff run the center with integrity and great care for children's well-being. Anyone I know with children I will definitely recommend sending them there.
