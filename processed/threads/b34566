5 Right on the Las Vegas National Golf Course. Great cheese burgers and bloody marys at a great price.  The Rat Pack Bar & Grill is unique in that it serves as the home to the Las Vegas Golf Hall of Fame exhibit. Happy hour 4-close.
3 I've been here twice and enjoy the food and atmosphere. The best thing I've had so far is the turkey club, I had a burger on my last trip and I wasn't too impressed.   The staff is extremely friendly and always quick on refills.   My guess is as I try more menu items ill be able to find things just as good as the club. Definitely not a bad place to visit after your round!
4 Great bar and grill. Food was really tasty. Drinks are awesome and priced fair!  We went around 4 in the afternoon and were the only people in the joint for about 10 minutes.  Then golfers came in to get drinks for the course and some came in to cool off inside with drinks and food! Our bartender/server was Donna. She alone is worth a stop!
