4 The wife and I have been going to this Quiznos for a while and have seen it's ups and downs. We went this week and were pretty surprised that they seem to have their act (back) together. People working were pretty friendly, they made the sandwiches right and all went as planned- shouldn't be such a big deal but these days all going as planned seems to be hard to find. Anyway, it was cool, they were cool, the sandwiches were hot- yum!
5 Love this place and the new owners are great.  The previous owners were forced to close down and the new guys have been in there for about a year.  I go in about once a week and they are super friendy and very fast service.  Highly recommend this locaiton.
