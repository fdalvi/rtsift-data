5 HUGE well organized thrift store. Prices aren't too bad, especially for baby clothes and books. You have to really pick through the adult section, but I never leave empty handed. Furniture and big ticket items disappear quickly. Also, a great place to escape the heat in the summer!
4 Nicer thrift store, many items to choose from, they got rid of there 99 cent days, and half price/99 sent colored tags. not too much junk. overall a trip worth while, especially for cloths! ;)
5 I donate here all of the time, but this time I actually dropped off something I was not supposed to drop off. Yikes! A week has passed, but I thought I'd give it a shot and see if I could get it back. Josh, one of the guys in the unloading dept., was very helpful. He even talked to the manager for me. Thank you so much Josh!
4 I love this store. They have really nice merchandise for very reasonable prices. The staff is all very friendly and helpful. I don't understand why certain people want to pull the race card and claim all of the employees are racist because they definitely are NOT. I think that kind of claim is very ignorant. Please do not let that person deter you from visiting this store.
2 This is more to Savers/Value Village as a corp. I have shopped these stores most of my life. I love the deal hunt and these stores are always full of wonderful old and new treasures. However recently the prices have been bordered on highway robbery. A second hand store should not have jeans for $20 or shoes for $30 regardless the brand.
4 I love you Savers and hopefully I'll find some books I want to take home today. I really need to get the scoop on sales days  and what these tags mean. I also have a lot to bring down and donate.
