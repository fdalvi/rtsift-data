2 what a messy place! If you want to look a good bargain you have to look carefully because everything is chaos! Even Big Lots has more order. Not worth my time.
3 In a similar vein as HomeGoods, Tuesday Morning offers discounted prices for retail brands for gifts and home accessories.  The name Tuesday Morning stems from their incoming shipments of new items each Tuesday.    I didn't really find too much of a problem navigating around the store.  Everything is arranged by section (kitchen, bath, clothes, electronics, pet accessories, outdoor, etc.).  I've picked up a cool induction stove for a great deal that we use often, and a few things here and there.  Go here if you're in the mood for browsing, since specific items might be harder to find here due to the ever changing selection each week.
