1 i was having a rough and stressful day.. and very hungry..  i was craving chicken and only place near me..  KFC.. what more is there to write about?? it says it all KFC!    should i talk about rude employees? should i talk about how dirty it was? or maybe i should talk about how nasty the food it was?? ummmmm...    well.. i was hungry.. and i was not planning to drive.. so i ordered grilled chicken..  okay.."sigh".. here is the problem.. i didn't care much about  rude customer service.. place being dirty.. or order took little longer than usual..  but all i wanted was juicy tender grilled chicken with my hot sauce and wash it down with ice cold soda..  am i asking too much here?? can a man take the time and enjoy his life a little? nah.. i was asking too much...  chicken was soo dry.. it can pass for beef jerky.. come on now?  at this point.. i realized and understood.. why some people gone insane and start shooting... i really wanted to throw my chicken at the staff who prep it..    now i know why they call it KFC.. killed for chicken!!
3 Well this KFC has always been super friendly , food on the other had is Okay... let me explain I always get the same thing at this KFC the Honey BBQ Sandwich very good!! but when I get the meal deals I run into trouble the meat is sometimes under-cooked which is really bad when you are cooking chicken.
2 This KFC is really slow you have to wait in long time in line before they actually ask if they can help, before you taken order, The portion size seem to be a lot smaller I don't know what's going on here so attempt with caution the tables are always sticky and the floor is always dirty.
2 Yum Yum chicken strips. Chicken strips which a vicious tonight they're only 260 cal for three yum Yum enjoy
1 How the shit do you run out of extra crispy, original recipe, and pot pies at the same time?
