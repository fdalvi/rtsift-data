5 Aldo has the GREATEST shoes!  Its so addicting! :)  The latest styles and reasonable prices! I've bought at least 5 pairs of "I-can't-live-without" shoes this month and I'm sure I will be returning for more.  This location is the nicest one in Las Vegas!
1 If you enjoy being left high and dry and accused of, by all means come on in!  Recently had a mishap damaged good sold to me at the Barstow Outlet store. While in town for vacation, seeing that I couldn't wear the damaged item and needed to return them to Aldo's. I made all the necessary calls to the original store to get some help from the Fashion Show Mall store to give me a exchange or refund.   The moment the store manager took a look at the damaged boots she quickly said "No, I would not accept these boots, you'll need to go back to where you got them because they are the ones who sold them to you this way and I personally would not consider even accepting this damaged item in my store." I had the feeling she had already accused me of the existing damaged item and she also said " Right now, its your word against the stores and I don't want to get involved."    I get it that retail might not be your career or that your $8.49 a hour doesn't cut it to be nice to your customers. The entire ordeal left a bitter taste and I would not consider wasting my time in the future with this store.
1 WOW.....I have never seen worse customer service. They clearly don't stand by thier merchandise or care about how they treat there customers. Called them to get a hardly worn pair of shoes fixed. They seemed extremely bothered when over a week later I called them to find out the whereabouts of my $100 shoes and what was happening to them. They were never sent out to be fixed and no one had called me. I ended up going in and taking them back. I got them fixed else where and with a lot less attitude. Shop there but once they have your money, don't expect them to help you any further!
