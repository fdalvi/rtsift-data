5 FINALLYYYY! After searching everywhere for a professional esthetician - I found Nadjege!   I called her yesterday for a full body wax appointment; I immediately clicked with her and appreciated her techniques (found on her website.) She is very meticulous (as I am) about body hair and will make sure every last piece of stubborn hair is gone. She uses a super bright lamp to check for missed spots and also switches between soft/hard wax... which served wonderfully at my appointment today. She has an in-home salon and spends a lot of time with you; I never once felt rushed and I was with her for THREE hours!  Side notes: even though she's located in uppity Scottsdale, her prices are ridiculously inexpensive compared to anywhere else. She also gives you great tips on skin care, which helped a lot, and is very hospitable. You don't need to go anywhere else... but don't take my time-slots ;)
5 I was extremely satisfied with my waxing services from Nadjege. She was thorough, practiced clean techniques including no double dipping and she was amazing at removing in-growns. Her home is beautiful, clean and very private; I felt very safe and comfortable there. Her prices are ridiculously affordable, especially for the quality of service she provides. Also, I was so relaxed I could barely stay awake and nearly fell totally asleep during waxing - that has never happened before! I have already made my next appointment with her.
5 Nadjege is the best waxer  I've ever had. Her prices are not only  ridiculously reasonable, and her waxing top notch, she's also personable and professional. She's highly flexible as well. I have definitely found my permanent waxer- and any one reading this should give her a call- they won't regret it.   Jennifer
5 I loved Nadjege!! I found her using yelp and was won over by the many great reviews about her waxing. She is extremely professional and informative. I will be back soon for a facial!
