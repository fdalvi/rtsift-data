2 The service was great and the espresso laced whip cream was yummy but they failed to stock more food for us hungry travelers. No flat bread and she was unable to make cheese omlets. Plus, the quiche had pork. Bummer!
3 Came here after my flight to get some ice tea. First off if you are gonna me open 24/7 as they say then you should also have things in stock. They didn't have the iced green or black tea available. They made the hot green tea to pour it over ice, but didn't wait for it to brew. Now pretty much all I have is warm water. The only reason I even gave it any higher than 1 star is because the guy behind me decided to buy my drink.
1 I ordered the italian flat bread. It was super moist. (when it comes to flat bread, "moist" is an automatic fail of course).  I also had a latte with almond syrope. Before this I don't remember the last time I had to throw a coffee away. Yes, it was that bad.
4 A surprising discovery at the Sky Harbor Airport! Took a friend to the airport, walked with her to the gate and realized there was still time before she had to go through security. That's when the aroma of coffee both hit us. Looked around and found Lola Coffee.  Doesn't have that burnt, over-roasted coffee flavor like some self-proclaimed coffee Star offers. Anyone with a sweet tooth will DEFINITELY like this!  I had the Caf√© Blanco and it was delicious!  Places with outlets to plug in a laptop for work and comfy chairs for relaxing. Service was great too. I will admit: there weren't many people around when we stopped. Might get crazy during traditional air travel hours.  Not a five-star 'cause we didn't order a meal or pastry (yeah, difficult to imagine that, but we were both full from lunch. I had a salad, which was shocking for both of us).  This will be my coffee fix anytime I'm at the airport.
5 For an airport eatery, the price is not bad for their omelettes! I paid $8.50 and this omelette is humongous! Very happy customer!
