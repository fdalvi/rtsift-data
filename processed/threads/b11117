1 Terrible.   My only word for it.   Ran in here while in Vegas for business, and needed a quick polish change.   The man doing the manicure was doing such a poor job, I made him stop after 45 min and left.   He was going to use the same implements on me that had been used on others, but did agree to get a new emery board when I insisted.  We could hardly communicate, but he managed to express that he expected payment, even tho the existing polish had not been entirely removed.  My nails were filed down so short, I actually had trouble picking things up for the next two days!    With SO MANY nail places around these days, how can any of them be so poor and keep their doors open?
5 I go for pink and white acrylic and they are always the prettiest, most shapely, long lasting and high quality. Best I ever had! They've rescued me from bad nail trauma from other nail techs 3 times now. I drive an hour from where I live to go there and it is SO worth it. The owner has high standards. Great pedicures too!
2 I have gone here on and off for a couple years now, but will not be going back. It is very dirty. Spilled polish everywhere and general uncleanliness. The tech doing my partners pedicure stopped in the middle to trim her own cuticles with the same tools. That's not sanitary! And to top it all off, when the lady waxed my eyebrows, she burned my face with the wax, leaving behind a small sore and ultimately scab under my eyebrow. Pick a different place.
