5 My roommate and I decided to go get some pizza, and I was a little low on fuel. We stopped at the Guru Express Market,  I was a little disappointed that the pump would not let me use my debit card and pin ... and my zip code gives me an error on my credit card side But i digress.  I had to actually walk in the store . I was really impressed with the cleanliness of the store... . and the gas prices were a lot lower than Henderson.  Thankfully this store is really close to my work , so it will be my new gas and sip shop. My roommate got hung up on the ice cream and frozen yogurt. Did I mention they have a TCBY in the store? The manager of the store was really awesome , we had to wait ten minutes to get ice cream cones, so he gave us free ice cream.  GREAT SERVICE.  He has gotten two tanks of gas out of me because of his kindness. I am sure there are many more to come. I totally recommend this store. Prices are convenience store prices for candy , chips and drinks..  But I am totally about the service folks.. and the staff and management here definitely provide great service.
3 The coolest part of this place is they have Faygo!!!  Faygo is a soft drink bottled in Detroit and is 99 cents for a 24oz bottle and comes in many flavors.  I haven't seen another place in the city which sells it, so this is a big plus.  On the negative side, I always see a lot of teens hanging outside of here and the gas pumps aren't very well maintained (CC reader broken on one pump, on another receipt would not print and card was very hard to slide through slider).  Needless to say I'll visit her to get my Faygo fix and nothing else.
