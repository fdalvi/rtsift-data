1 Needed to reset my ATM PIN.  i hour wait, had to make an "appointment" to wait another 10 minutes.  BofA is all about process and not about the customer experience.  The whole transaction took 2 minutes but the drag on my time was over an hour, really?
5 Great customer service. Friendly people. Occasionally busy but they handle customers quickly but efficiently.
1 Seriously? 1.5 hours to get a wire transfer?  This is ridiculous. Bank elsewhere.
5 Although I was frustrated at what was happening Zachary made the experience great.  Thanks for you patients
2 Everytime I come here weather it be early In the morning , midday , or late afternoon they seem to only have 2 tellers working. Line long and takes a really long time... They need to put more tellers up
4 I have a safety deposit box here and never have a problem with the service at this location.  They have always been very helpful and I like the fact that they have someone at the front to assist you with whatever questions you have, whether it being talking to a personal banker or just answering questions regarding their international exchange fees, etc.
