4 I had never tried Aveda products before, but happened to wander into the store in the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile Shops a couple of weeks ago.  I'd heard of Aveda cuz my aunt and cousin use it, but I didn't know what the fuss was all about.  WELL...its a good thing my hubby dragged me outta the store or I would have bought more.  I ended up with a couple of lip glosses - they are the BOMB - and some scented body oil.  Yeah, the damages could have been MUCH worse.  The store associates were friendly, helpful and let me try everything on before settling into what colors looked good on me.  They offered hot tea and gave me a whole little guide on my Chakra - whatever that means...prolly a whole lotta mumbo jumbo, but it made me feel pretty! Oh so pretty!  so pretty, and witty, and wi...well, you get my point.  GO HERE!
5 Fantastic service at this store. I do not remember the name of the saleslady, but she previously worked at the Art of Shaving, and according to the receipt from when I made my purchase, her initials are DB.  She was very thorough and professional.  Unfortunately, I cannot say the same regarding the Aveda store in Philadelphia.  I was treated with absolute disdain from the moment I walked in the door.
