5 My friend went into the store a few semesters back and rented some books. Apparently he saved nearly $300 on a couple of books. I was astounded! Way too good to be true! So I went in myself and discovered I was wrong.. the place is very much legitimate and the claim is true. They save you tons of money on your college textbooks!
2 If you're trying to sell your books you're better off selling them at the end of the semester back to the bookstore on campus or even keeping your books than selling them here.  The owner offered me 5 bucks for my Psych book because he said they already had too many. I took the book back to school and they gave me 25. I also used their website to search ISBNS to see book values, I had a book worth $50 yet when I brought it to the store he wouldnt accept it!   Dont sell your books here.
2 I gave them my class schedule, I rented the books. One book I did not need. I went back to returned it (1week after) the manager did not want to give my money back.  Be careful!!! Or they we'll get your money this way.
5 The manager was friendly, and helped to resolve any issues that I encountered. He gives excellent customer service!! Care-plus!! Highly recommended.
