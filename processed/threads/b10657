5 Okay, I know what you're thinking: Vegas is to fine art as gritty, greasy oil is to pure, clean glacial water.  But no!  There is art to be found in the City of Sin... you just have to know where to look.  For example, the Wynn Casino.  Steve Wynn, if you didn't know, is not only mind-bogglingly rich but also a patron of the arts, and a major art collector.  Some of the paintings he has are things you'd never expect to see outside a museum.  The Wynn Collection came to the Nevada Museum of Art (in Reno) last year, so I saw it then, and was impressed.  When the Wynn casino opened, the collection initially had its own gallery, nestled off the main floor near the shops, which Nevada residents could get into for $3, making it one of the few genuine bargains in Vegas.  But since money is, after all, the prime consideration, the gallery was closed earlier this year due to poor ticket sales, and the space will be converted into retail space for more of the couture brands that already grace the Wynn's shopping mall.  Fortunately, the art itself didn't go away, and the pieces have been redistributed around the casino, with the showpiece - Picasso's "Le Reve" - displayed in the main lobby.  I haven't seen the collection since it was taken out of the gallery, but it's an impressive selection of pieces by Warhol, Singer, van Gogh, Manet, Gaugin, and Jan Brueghel the Younger, among others.  If you have the patience and stamina for a casino-wide scavenger hunt, this is likely the best free show you'll see in Vegas.
5 Great collection from Wynn and you get to hear Wynn's voice explaining each art piece.    I remember the diamond art piece (yes, an art piece made out of diamonds).   It's made my Vegas vacation more memorable than the usual gambling / clubs/ buffets.
