1 Very sketchy office & no front desk person. The doctor is the only one working. Waiting room is very small.
1 Wednesday around 4 PM. There was no receptionist and I waited 20 minutes, still no one. I left. Don't even bother coming here
1 Office is small it's weird, 80's feel and so is the doctor (Rosen). He kept pacing when we were talking to him before he gave us the paper work to fill out, he was making me nervous! I did not like that he charged me a $2.00 fee to run my visa!! Who does that anymore!?
1 As I drove past this office twice (no visible sign until you look in a window) I finally found it. Walked in, signed in at 1806 (6:06 pm) there was no one in sight. No receptionist, no people....nobody. There was plenty of patients records on the desk though for all the world to see and go through if they wanted since there was NO ONE around. I waited for 10-15 minutes.....ended up leaving since THERE WAS NO ONE THERE. An unlocked clinic, no one there (cant say it enough) patients records within reach.....I left....Nice way to run your business. Will tell all to never go there.
