5 The Korean lady is very nice there. My dry cleaning is done quickly and she hooks me up sometimes!
5 I loved this place. Very friendly and great customer service.  I'm out of town and I need my wedding dress steamed and my husband's suit pressed I was a lil worried because it was my wedding dress and my wedding was the next day. But they had my dress ready the next day at 10 and they did an AWESOME JOB!!! I really would recommend this place to anyone.
5 The lady here is so nice and polite. Everything is always done on time and my clothes are always returned perfect! I've been going here for three yrs now.  The prices are great too.
5 Ms Julia is a gem!  She made sure my pressing was done in a short period of time and her customer service is impeccable.  I am the customer who was abandonded by two taxi's the weekend of the Marine Corps Ball at the New Orleans.  I wish this cleaners years of success.  Thank you for your going above and beyond usuall customer service.
