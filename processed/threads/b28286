3 Peering into the window of Zamboo, I thought I would absolutely hate everything inside as it looked like overpriced tat. I was pleasantly surprised when I browsed around as more than a few things caught my eye. I find this shop hilarious as it has a really stagnant feel about it with bizarre music that sounds like something off of a TV shopping channel. You know, the ones on at dubious hours where they flog off what look like the remnants of an old ladies house starting at £9027354924 for a pair of curtains and get them down to £1.  I'm not sure I would actually buy anything from here but I could see a few things looking good on a dining room table or as focal points in hallways or the like.   Good for presents I guess and the prices aren't too bad either, I spotted a nice vase for £25, so good for a housewarming gift or something for a house proud family member.  My friend was a huge fan of the chess board table mats complete with other decorative table stuff and a storage case also in keeping with the chess theme. This little set was £129 and although quite pricey, it was really unusual and if you like that kind of thing then why not? They also had a rather bizarre green ceramic horse/donkey thing and at £199 I'm at a loss to understand what you would do with it, where you would put it and why on earth anyone would want such a monstrosity?
