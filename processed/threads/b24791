4 You know how sometimes you're starving for some good Chinese Buffet?  Well, I have that come up about once a day, so this morning I dropped into Panda here to see what was!  This is a fairly good-sized place, newish looking, & real nice inside.  I got settled in & then counted up 97 attractive food choices, plus condiments, sauces, & so on.  I didn't see any chicken feet, but there were a few other oddball goodies around for the adventurous, along with some not-odd-but-nice unusual treats, & then the usual fare that we see at these places.  Here were some of the highlights for me here at Panda:  *  The Mongolian BBQ.  The veggie selection was somewhat limited & the chef had a peculiar way of cooking everything, but it came out tasting great, spiced just as I requested, with beef, chicken, & BIG shrimp!  *  HUGE asparagus spears, baked to exactly the right crunchiness from end to end, & topped with cheese.  Reeeeally good!  *  Stuffed Crab on the Half-Shell.  Not unusual, but extra tasty here!  *  Stuffed Mushrooms.  Again, not unusual but the ones here were so good I could have gone back for a plateful of them!  *  Something I've never seen before called "Baked Seafood Roll".  Ok, sounds like something blah out of Kansas (or Hometown Buffet), right?  Hey, it was GREAT!!  There were just a couple of less-wonderful things here...  The booth seats are lower than they should be for the height of the tables, & the space between the seats & tables is a little too wide.  Also, the sushi was unattractively presented in stainless serving trays, instead of on nice plates.  I hear you saying, "Sitting at a table rather than a booth would have solved your first problem (just as at New Great China Super Buffet on 75th Ave.), & moving the sushi to YOUR plate solves the second!"  Ok, then...  "Yeah Panda!"    :-))  Lunch Buffet $6.39, Sr. $5.75

3 This is by far, the best buffet in the area. The food tastes great and the selection is great. I'll be going back often.   Only three stars from me because the food at these buffets here in Phoenix are still nowhere near the quality I have come to expect from eating at buffets in other states. Also, Try China Grill or Wong's Jr for non buffet dinners.
