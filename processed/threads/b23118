5 We took our Yorkie here last week and we were so pleased.  They squeezed us in on a moment's notice.  It was night and day compared to the grooming at Petsmart (our first dog, be forgiving :) haha)  Very nice and informed staff.  Highly recommend.
5 We've used this facility twice, once to self-bathe our goldendoodle and once for full-service grooming. The shop is very clean with a quiet atmosphere. The equipment for DIY washing is very good, materials provided are exactly what's required. The full-service groomer who bathed and trimmed our dog was gentle and very good with our every aspect of the process. When I asked her to trim the ears shorter, she cheerfully re-cut and shaped them right away.  I have no hesitation in recommending this shop.
1 I know...one of a bunch that says otherwise. My BFF took one of her pack to Posh Wash Friday for grooming.  Never, ever had flea or tick issues with any of her dogs before (she has 4) and trust me, they ARE her children.   Yesterday (Sunday) she's at the vet because all of them now have fleas and ticks.  She now has to have all of the dogs, her house, and yard treated. I'd be sure to check your pet carefully for fleas, ticks, and stuff in the ears after taking them here...especially ears.    I've had personal experience with another bad groomer (PetSmart in PV). I dropped off a happy, healthy dog and picked up one who had had a rather agressive anal gland clearing. Two days later he had red, swollen ears which my vet said was an ear infection likely due to cross-contamination with infected bedding, towels, washing facility, etc.    My dog came home acting like he'd been sedated; all he wanted to do was sleep, he had a visible loss of energy and was clearly not himself. We called PetSmart who denied that they gave him anything or did anything to hurt him - but my dog's actions and behavior spoke much louder than PetSmart's words.  I switched groomers and voila! no more ear infections. It goes back to sanitation, experienced staff, and sincere care given to provide good service.
5 We love taking our 2 dogs here for the self wash. No bending over the bathtub or messing up your bathroom. We haven't used the groomers, because they are both short haired and easy enough to wash ourselves. Owners are super helpful and nice
5 This place is a blast!!! I took my husky mix here and it was so much fun. Posh Wash Dog Wash has a very cute boutique style set up upon entrance, where you are welcomed by the friendly staff. In the back there are a series of tubs that come equipped with your own little grooming tools, clean towels, and you even have your own choice of shampoo. The shampoo and conditioner is already mixed in with the water so it makes the entire dog washing experience seamless.   It's $20 per dog, which in my opinion is totally worth it. There is no time limit, so you can really take your time if you want to soak up the experience. I brushed my dog for a while before even starting the bath, really massaged her fur during shampooing, and deep conditioned her as well :)   I will be coming here again.
5 My dog was so happy compared to the nightmare at petsmart and the people are so nice.  Nice quiet place that did a fantastic trim and wash in less than 2 hours and they keep to their schedule.  Love it!
5 Great place! We have a collie and sheltie and this place does a great job in grooming their coats. The staff is very friendly and takes care of our dogs.
3 I used to really like this place but they nicked a piece of my dogs ear twice! The first time they told me about it and I accept that accidents happen and I let it go even though my dogs ear was bleeding. After the second time I was done. It's really too bad because the staff is nice and its clean but if I keep taking my dog there he won't have any ears left. We've been going there for 2 years.
5 I took my Wheaton Terrier there for a groom and was pleased the moment I walked in the door.  The shop was clean, peaceful and the lady at the front desk was so nice.    It was easy to be an appointment and she was ready when they said she would be.  She looked amazing and they groomed her exactly as I requested.  When I am in Glendale, I will go no where else!
5 I have known Jennifer Y. for many years. She is an amazing (and fast) groomer. She is the only one I trust my boys with fully. She can get both shih-tzus done in just over an hour (I shave them both down with a #10 blade).
5 Does a great work with my dog, highly recommend
5 Great place! We always take our dogs here.
5 Great place to do it yourself or pay them to do it for you.   I paid $22 to wash my pup pup. Place has it all, and is super clean.   They give you the rundown on how it  works and walks you back to your station. You get a ramp for your doggie to walk up to get into the tub, they will help with that if you need.   Here's what you get: a basket of brushes, combs and a special rubber brush to use when you are washing you doggie. You get nail clippers, hand towels, regular  size towels, a sham (use first to get all the water off, then use towels and then blow dryer). Hypoallergenic shampoo and conditioner. Ear and eye cleaner and cologne spritz.  They supply the long apron you need to wear, cuz you do get wet, lol  This was my fist time in, I will be back and highly recommend. After all, I couldn't do what I did at home with the time involved to set it up and do the task, and clean up and I think I was there like 1.5 hours and I'm done and my pup pup looks great, smells great and it was painless considering it was a first for the both of us.  They have rewards also, buy I think 4 washes, get the 5th free, something like that, what a deal.
5 I absolutely love this place!!! Take such great care of my Odie and his brother Ivan!!!! When I elect for self service, it's always clean well stocked and they are always right there if you need help or have any questions!!! The staff is beyond friendly and helpful and my Odie always looks fabulous and happy!!!!
5 My first time ever at a dog wash and it was great!  I usually take my dogs to my groomer but when I got a new puppy I decided to try it myself.  The lady there showed me how everything works and continued to check on me making sure I didn't have any questions. No sore back, no wet dog smell and best of all EVERYTHING is supplied.  They also have an area for when my pup gets to be 200 pounds.  I have one less grooming bill now!
2 I been here twice and it does the job but I found a cheaper place with better equipment, the tubs for self wash are on the small size, space is limited, you can't rise or lower the tubs as other places (again cheaper places) .  Eh I wanted to like cause its close to me but I will make a further drive
2 I went there to use the self service wash. I expecting to  bath and fully dry my Australian Shepherd. The large tub they let me use was very small. While washing my dog I got the floor and my shoes soaked. The dryer ( and nozzles) the have for you to use are not powerful enough to blow out his under coat. I very frustrated due to the fact my dog is now wet and if I don't blow out his under coat it will mat up. I ask one of the groomers if I paid for a dry for my dog if she could, ( I am sure they use a more powerful dryer) due to the fact the dryer they provide isn't powerful enough to get his coat out. She explain she couldn't it's against policy. They did allow me to grab a nozzle I had in my car which made it work a little better to get some of the under coat out. I ended up doing the fluff and dry system. But I remembered when I first came in around 3:20 pm that the receptionist told me just as a reminder we close at 5. So around 4:45 I called it quits on trying to get my dog completely dry, because I knew the associates had to still clean up my mess and I am sure they would of wanted to leave on time. So I left with my dog about 60% dry and today I get to spend  time dematting him. So it comes down to for small single coat dogs this would be a good facility to do self service bath, but if you have a big dog with undercoat, I would say go elsewhere. They don't have the right equipment for big breeds with under coat. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the staff was nice. Smiles when I came in and answered my questions. Plus I forgot my undercoat rake, when I called she said she will leave it up front for me to get it the next day. I came in asked for it and got it no problems. They knew exactly where it was.
