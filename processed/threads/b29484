2 Is close to home. They tried harder and had 24 hour before Safeway closed down on the diagonal corner. Had a return with expired stale food and was treated terribly! So next time my chicken leftovers were spoiled by the next morning I didn,t even bother. Plus you'll have to dodge the high school kids begging for some "spare change" or cigarettes. Just go to Walmart 2 miles away, it's cheaper and they have security.
4 This Fry's Market it's really clean, located on the SE corner of 107th Ave & Indian School. What I really, really love about this location, unlike the one closer to my house, is that they added a "Olives & Antipasti" Bar!!!!! We had to try some of the assortment of olives and antipasti, and we were not left down. I mean, it is a super-market, right? They had a great array of olives, and also artichokes, peppers, mushrooms, etc. We are planning on going back this Friday!!!
3 3.5 Stars  This is my weekly grocery stop.  This Fry's location is clean and in the process of a remodel.  The deli carries Boar's Head meats which are my favorite!  Their fried chicken is so good.  The non-food items are generally more expensive than the evil super corporate mega grocery store.  Fry's will also multiply your coupons up to $1.
