4 This place has good pickings. A little more expensive than St Vincent Depaul's, but the stuff tends to be nicer. They've got the main staples of a thrift store: a fair amount of glasswares and kitchen garb along with a modest furniture selection. Clothes can be found in the back.
1 I thought this was a thrift shop?  Well, I gagged at their prices...no thanks and no way.
2 The staff is super friendly but the prices are RIDICULOUS! I was thinking; "this crap didn't cost this much when it was new!!"
1 Wow, the 5 women in this place are hardcore tweakers...  And yeah what's with the insane prices
1 I went by here yesterday,  4/29/14. It was empty & for sale.
