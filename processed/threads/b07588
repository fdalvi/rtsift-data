3 CASH ONLY.. I drove to Circle K and got cash out.   Alfredo's Deli is not a deli... it is a road side burrito house with a walk up window and tables outside to sit on.   Alfredos has been around since the 70's and the the current owner has been there since 1990. He bought it from the Orig owners when they retired. He is very friendly and personable.   They make mainly Mexican food with some American food mixed in.   I had a Green Chili burrito and chips with salsa. The burrito was plenty big but not overly huge. The chips were fresh and thick. Although I enjoyed the meal there was nothing to bring me back. I wish it did.
4 Red chilli is very good beef tacos are awsome!!!
2 My friend and I went on a quest for some cheap but still good mexican food. We spent 12 dollars between the two of us and did not get what we paid for. First, we actually had to run to Circle K to get cash since they don't accept cards. Then when we finally got our food and got home, we were underwhelmed. The taco was equivalent to Jack in the Box, the rice was no good and the burrito was just bland. So skip this taco stand and go to one of the 500+ mexican food places in downtown Phoenix.
