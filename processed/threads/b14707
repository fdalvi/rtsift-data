4 LOVE me some Cold Stone!  My new latest fav is Devil's Brew which is Coffee ice cream, mixed with chocolate brownie, chocolate & caramel topping.  Staff is always friendly!  Look for coupons in most Sunday papers too!
4 It's cold stone. Pretty tasty, overpriced ice cream served by disinterested teenage girls. Still worth coming for an ice cream for my birthday.
4 Always a very guilty pleasure. I don't remember what it's called but the one that mixes waffle cone into the ice cream is freakin' delicious. Obviously not good for the health conscious Surprisian, but as a treat every once and a while it is delicious.
