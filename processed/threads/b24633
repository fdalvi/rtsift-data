5 Quik, huge selection of drinks and cheap quality gas.
3 Great selection , clean store, friendly staff......But WAY to many panhandlers and  vagrants allowed to hang around outside ...Oh and don't tell me staff is unaware as they are always out there cleaning or something or other .They (the street bums )  will even come up to you while you are pumping gas & ask for money   I have told the staff as have some of my coworkers. You always get the same answer "we will look in to it (and maybe they do) but the next day there they (the street bums )  are   great store though "love the cherry slushies"
2 A lot of beggars you can't get gas at night or right when the sun goes down they come out and try to ask for money and when you don't give them any they stand and watch you get gas and wait and ask again, It's really annoying. I think they hired a security guard but they don't do nothing. A lot of beggars, I don't go here anymore since that.
3 UPDATE....quikTrip has hired a security guard . The only problem he does not do a single thing about the aggressive panhandling unless it is right under his nose               Two nights ago I had a very scary young man ask me for money while I was pumping gas When I told him I had no cash (I didn't)  he slung coffee on my car and screamed "ugly bitch" at me 2 or 3 times before walking PAST the security guard to go into the store ..That's it I am done I wont be back there after dark
4 Listen carefully, whatever you do, STAY AWAY FROM THE HOT DOGS. 5 of my family members had them one night for a quick late snack and we ALL got food poisoning for at least 3 days. This is the 3rd time I get food poisoning from eating these hotdogs, especially the jalape√±o ones, but the 1st 2 times were a merely upset stomach, the 3rd time was a full blown food poisoning.  Everything else is fine, including the drink selections.
