5 If you haven't been here then run right over. Tired of the same old stuff you see on every other woman in Scottsdale? Dash on over to Joy Li. Joy knows how to design clothes to make every woman look sexy and confident. So don't expect to bargain shop. These clothes are well made with very upscale fabrics. Check it out.
5 I have been a customer and now friend of Joy's almost since in the inception of Studio Joy Li.  My meeting with Joy Li was sheer happenstance.  I was shopping for very specific item for a dear friend.  On that day, I fell in fashion love!  At the time, I was living in my home state of Kentucky.  Our relationship didn't end when I returned home.  Each season, I received her shipment to make my wardrobe selection. Joy's unique design style will differentiate one from the masses providing you exclusivity.  One season, builds upon the next. I can feel confident wherever I go dressed in the classic colors that I can change from season to season.  Fabrics work effortlessly in layering.  I not only look great but feel comfortable wearing Studio Joy Li and have a very extensive collection.  I have had a love affair with Joy's clothes that has literally taken me around the world and back.  I have toured the streets of Paris, Bordeaux, London, New York, Chicago, and San Francisco in Studio Joy Li.  Now living in The Valley of the Sun, I get to regularly participate in the fashion events and experience the wonderful customer service provided by Joy, business partner, Jean Bartolomei and stylist, Suzanne Day.
5 Studio Joy Li is awesome! You will not find style, fashion or fit like this anywhere else!  Most of the pieces in the boutique are original Joy Li designs. Joy designs each piece to work together within the collection, as well as being a master at cut and fit. Not only will these clothes  fit you unlike any mass produced lines you have ever tried on, the fabrics feel and wear great and the detailing is unique.  Totally worth the trip!
