5 Great Tacos & Burros  24hr   Yummy...8 )
5 Carne Asada is the most tender on Monday morning!!!! Then it's the Chicken & Cheese Burro w/ Green sause
3 Ended up in the hood after going for a ride at the Ponderosa Stables.    Shoot I gotta try the authentic Mexican food and lets put this East Coast West Coast thing to rest.    Pulled out my Yelp app and found Taco Feliz.  3 of us had dinner for 20.00!  My carne asada was pretty darn good and it was huge I could not eat it all.  Fish tacos were just OK needed some lemon/lime on it.  Decided to eat in the car as the place had no A/C and the neighborhood was a little sketchy.   I'm not sure this place solidified the "West Coast has the best Mexican thing"
4 So I have passed this place many times before without knowing it was close to my job.  So after forgetting my lunch one day, a co-worker suggested we go there to eat.  I was pleasantly surprised by the food and family feeling.
4 Comfort food to me is a bean and cheese burrito and a little carne asada on the side. El Taco Feliz does not disappoint with either. The area, is a little sketchy. I recommend locking car doors as a safety measure, especially at night as their drive through is pretty dark. During the day it's probably not too bad but at night, be aware.   That being said, my son (and I) prefer the cheese they use here, to that of Filly B's. Their bean and cheese burritos seem a little cheesier and tastier. They have a location that is off Dobbins as well. It has eat in dining and a pretty descent salsa bar. One of my favorite fast food joints in town.
