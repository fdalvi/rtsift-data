3 You can't fool me.  This is not an outlet!  I can get this stuff at home!
2 I can't really say I am surprised by my disappointment with this store.  I worked for an Old Navy back in Indiana for a couple of Christmas seasons, and can't say the ones out here aren't any different.  The staff is rude/lazy (can't understand how you work in a story and walk past a person/couple three times and not once say hello or can I help you find anything).  The prices don't seem to be any cheaper than any other Old Navy (and this one is an "outlet", so I was looking for REALLY REALLY low prices).  Will probably try to avoid this and continue to shop at the Gap outlet in the same mall.
3 We decided to stop in here while walking through the mall. This particular store is advertised as an Old Navy Outlet, and while we were there they had a 40 percent off all items special going on.   I've shopped at Old Navy very often over the years, and as far as I could tell this wasn't much of a difference in price over what you could find in the regular stores with a good sale. Even still, there was a large selection of clothing in typical Old Navy styles.  The guy working the fitting room area was quick to acknowledge and get you into a room. Our cashier was also very friendly. All in all, not a bad experience but I prefer the regular stores to this location.
