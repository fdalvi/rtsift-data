1 I have always gone to Firestone out of convenience since they are two minutes from me. The manager was relocated and the air of this place has changed. I was quoted $900 on a brake job which they brought down to $700 with their "discounts". I went somewhere else for a second opinion and learned that half of what I was told needed to be done-didn't need to be touched. So they either were going to charge me for work not done or parts not put in. Got my brakes fixed at one third the quoted price. Feeling upset that they tried to take advantage of me-possibly because I am a woman. Boo on them.
1 Took my car here for an oil change, and when they took it in the back the manager told the mechanic that was working on my car to leave and pick up a lady at her house, whole there were 3 other mechanics conversing on the side. So that added another 20 mins to my overall time and when I confronted him about it he thought he did nothing wrong. Also they have me a quote of $900 for a control arm that cost me $300 at the shop down the street. NEVER GO HERE
3 "Complete Auto Care?"  I don't think so!  These guys are okay for brakes, oil, tires and basic stuff... maybe shocks/struts?  Go to a real mechanic shop for anything bigger than that.  I had them work on a rear main seal on a jeep grand Cherokee and had to go back in 2 times after that... for them to completely redo the job both times.  Needless to say,  it still leaked after 3 tries.  At least #2 & #3 were under warranty.
