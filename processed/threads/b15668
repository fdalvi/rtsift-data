3 Really nice place for a pharmacy/convenienf store...i can see the convenience..pharmacy does procrastinate @times
5 Thank you for being open Christmas day. I needed batteries for my kids toy and they where open. They were pushing the cheap ones but I stuck my guns and got the energizer.
1 This pharmacy is rubbish. I dropped a script off. Came back an hour later. They filled it and stated that they no longer take my insurance. I told them to give my script back and I'll go elsewhere. They wouldn't give me the script back. THIEVES. I'll never go to another Walgreens. Go to CVS just down the street at 6391 West Lake Mead Boulevard.
2 They have an okay customer service for their customers, I just wish they would smile more and make us feel more welcomed.
4 I like this Walgreens.  Always well stocked and the customer service is always good.  We bought some pistachios that were onsale ( had been stocked on the wrong peg) and instead of arguing with us, and making us feel stupid, they honored the sale price.  The cashier is always more than friendly, sometime bordering on creepy happy.  Will come again and again.  Haven't used this location for prescriptions, so cant comment on that.
1 I have never had so many issues with a pharmacy. It is frustrating this is the closest to my house because this Walgreens makes me so frustrated I am writing my first review. Couldn't even drop off a prescription for my fianc√© because I didn't have her id...so ridiculous. They told me to go down the street to a different Walgreens that would allow me to. It is great when I get to spend more time driving around just to drop off a script.
