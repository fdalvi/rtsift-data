5 I had glue on a silk shirt after I washed it with a name tag still on it. A few dry cleaners said ditch the shirt. I took it here and he said he would work on it and come back in 3 days. I was thinking it would be ruined. Well he got it all of and I paid 3.65 and that's cheap. I would of paid 8.00 for the great job they did. 1 happy customer
5 Sunrise cleaners is the best dry cleaner on the east side, hands down. Aside from wonderful service and lower than average prices, this place is quick and efficient. I've been coming here for a few months now and I won't be changing anytime soon.
1 Drove past this place last night, the business is closed down.
