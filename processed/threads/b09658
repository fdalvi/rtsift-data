5 Awesome! I got a coupon at Fry's for a $14.99 pedicure so I figured I'd give em a shot. Boy am I glad I did. Very clean place. I was dry impressed that they had a medical grade sterilizer on premasis and that the tools were sanitary. They did an amazing job. I also brought my grandmother and they did a phenomenal job on her as well. Very nice and gentile. Would highly recommend to anyone. Prices r a bit higher than most salons but very well worth it especially knowing that your not gonna come home with some creating crud infection or fungus!!   Keep up the good work!!!
5 This is the best Nails Spa that I have been to in many years. The place is clean and the staff are friendly.  My nails are beautiful.   I love this place.  I am coming here every two weeks now. This is a five STARS place.  -Danielle
3 Hit and miss. The owner does a fantastic job! On the other hand I have had fills from two others and they were terrible. Same with pedicure. I have one lady I love and the rest not so much. They could use a better polish selection as well. Good tips and powders tho.  It's hard to find a good shop. It's usually just a person at the shop. This is one of those places.
5 I love this place!  They did a great job on my nails.
