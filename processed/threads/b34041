5 I started getting my taxes done here about 14 years ago, a friend referred me, and I stuck with them, following them over the years as they moved. This is a family owned company, the founder recently passed away, but her sons that have worked there have carried on the business. I feel their prices are very fair, and they are very honest. I don't feel like they are doing shady business or feel like I may get audited.  I hate math, numbers or anything to do with money, and I get nervous thinking of being responsible for anything that has to do with the gov't. Well last year I decided that I should try and do my own taxes, so I did this year. Well it took me 2.5 hours, as compared to literally 5 minutes to the experts there. I definitely think $100 is worth my time. I learned my lesson. See you next year Jon!
5 The staff at Conrado & Company are very quick, efficient and don't give you the run around like other places can. The prices are very reasonable and you won't feel like you've been ripped off.  Big mahalo to Angela T. for helping us find a very reliable company!...ALOHA!!!  YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(218/365) "Tax Time"
5 My husband and I have been clients since moving to Las Vegas in 2004. They are fantastic! They are genuine and care about their clients. I know if we did our own taxes we would never come out as well as we do with their help. They are professional and understand the ever changing tax laws and can explain them perfectly. We will continue to be loyal clients and refer everyone we know to them!
5 Tax time... yuck!!! But who prepares them for you makes all the difference.  Staff is very friendly and professional. If you are able to file your own...good for you but if you prefer to have a professional have at it then this is your place. I am sure everyone is great here but we had the pleasure of working with Anne Conrado and for the first time in a very long time I can say I am looking forward to working with her next year!  Although they do take in walk-ins I would definitely suggest making an appointment.
5 These tax professionals are fantastic, friendly, attentive, and very welcoming!!!
5 Thank you John for taking care of my taxes in a professional, efficient manner. My family and I have been using Conrado & Company for many years and will continue to be loyal customers. The staff is extremely friendly and very competent. This is by far the best place to get your taxes done, call them today!
5 They are great at what they do, tax appts are quick and painless. I've been doing my taxes with them for over 5 years and won't go to anyone else! I actually moved out of the area but since I have been a long standing client they allowed me to mail them all of my info and did a phone consultation for me. Seriously, they are awesome, don't go to anyone else!!!!
