2 Heaven...or 7-11....Hahahaha! Ok,  I thought that was pretty funny....cause it is the latter of the two. So, this is just your average, dirty, everything is about to expire, run in the wall 7-11.   I know what your thinking...."But Tanya - you checked in here" Guilty as charged. Sometimes a girl needs a twinkie and a coke to get her back on her feet. DON'T judge!  Would I go out of my way to go back - no. Was I glad I stopped - yes.  7 reasons to go, 11 reasons not too :)
5 I consider this "my" 7 eleven.  One can always count on the tall beers and blunts stocked to the fullest.  Who am I kidding, you can walk into any 7 eleven in north las Vegas and feel like you are right back in Detroit where hockey town is; although, feels more like the detroit from the movie Robocop 3.
5 My 7-Eleven when Im in Vegas! And when I used to live here!  Its always clean and the staff are friendly!   Nachos and Slurpees.... mMm...
3 7-Elevens should only satisfy your need for convenience and usually they fall miles short of that.  This 7-11 off of Craig Rd. provides what is needed, as minimal as it is:  Relatively cheap gas, clean store, and a toilet that flushes.  Located shortly from the I-15 and across from a major local casino, so you can add another 100 convenient points to this convenient store.
