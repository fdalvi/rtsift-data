5 Excellent new studio. My kids are in taking martial arts here but are learning much more than just that.
5 Mr and Mrs. Garcia at the ATA in Chandler on Alma school are the best instructors my son ever had, he had taken classes at a different Academy in the past but this ATA by far is more complete, clean and organized, my son loves going to his classes, they have a reward program for the kids so they are always motivated. they are so involve into helping your kid develop their skills while they teach them discipline and respect. my son has more self esteem and confidence.  if you think no one can help your kid because of behavior problems, this is where you can start...how I found them? trough dignty kids, see what they are all about.  http://leesatamember.com/dignity
5 Love this school! The instructors are great and this is a wonderful place to take your child to learn about respect, discipline, self confidence and more.  The instructors truly care about your child and your family. My husband, son, and I have been involved with ATA for over two years and it is the best thing that we could have done to get us healthy and strengthen us as a family.
5 My son and I have been involved in ATA for several years. My son is learning about discipline, respect and self control. The instructors are wonderful and make you want to do better and work hard.  We are very happy we joined.
5 Great school. Great instructors. My son has learned so much at this school. It's more than just learning the moves. It's learning discipline, respect for yourself and others and so much more. The parents are also great at this school. It feels like a community   While our kids learn the fine art of good sportsmanship through the competitions. Just an overall great experience this far. Love it.
