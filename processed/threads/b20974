4 Aside from stocking all the equipment any serious mountaineer could need, the more modest traveller can opt for a top quality winter coat for any occasion. The selection of North Face jackets here are more then enough to see you through Edinburgh's cruel winters. Of course, expect to pay a hefty price for such technical attire but no doubt it will last you many a winter month.  Occasionally, however, you may spot a bargain on some of the single layered undergarments, ideal pre-ski trip.
5 I came in here a little bit bright eyed looking for a present for my dad. He was going skiing the next day and it was his birthday....what's a gal to do?! So I asked a few really friendly sales people and was directed up some stairs to find myself in snow sports heaven. I must have looked as confused as I was, because within a few minutes I was getting help from one of the sales advisors,she was lovely! We managed to pick out things that my Dad would use and he loved them If I ever go skiing I'm definitely coming here, they are so lovely!
4 The first thing you'll notice about the items in here are their excellent value for money.  At the moment it is sale time, but nevertheless you can get a decent fleece for Â£5 and let's be honest you're not going to beat that price very easily.  Heading further into the shop you'll discover that it is a very credible camping goods supplier and this good value does not infer poor quality with many of the well known brands on offer here.  Generally if you want a camping items you'll be likely to find it here and thanks to the helpful staff, finding anything shouldn't be much of a problem.
5 Great shop, full to the rafters with every adventuring item you could ever think of. There are three floors packed with goodies.   Must say that on my last visit I was particularly impressed with the staff. We kept one guy busy for over half an hour, asking questions, trying stuff on, getting advice... He was lovely, helpful and extremely knowledgeable.   This has always been my first port of call for outdoor gear, and I won't be changing my mind any time soon! :)   Sure, you can probably find gear cheaper online, but the advice and help from the guys at Tiso is worth the internet savings. Go here for more than the gear.
