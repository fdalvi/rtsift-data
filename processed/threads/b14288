4 Nice place, fairly new and well appointed.  They serve free breakfast and dinner.  Easy freeway on/off and everyone was nice.  A very good value.
4 Great place for business trips.  Friendly, helpful staff.  Big rooms.
5 Had not stayed at Homewood before   Great value and an amazing place!   From the moment we were met at the front dest by Antionette and Debra, with more personality and smile than people should be allowed to have, to a great comfortable full service room, to a wonderful breakfast to a late checkout that we needed.......this was a great experience.   The two ladies made it even more special than the already great rooms.  We will look to homewood from now on.
4 Great place to stay.  Friendly staff, and clean, big, comfy rooms.  Just wish there was better dining options nearby.
4 Beautiful, nicely furnished, spacious rooms with kitchens and full-sized refrigerators. Complimentary breakfast and dinner. Excellent service. I stay here often.
5 Great location.  Friendly staff.  I had an issue with my shower head and they replaced it immediately, without question.  Hilton breakfast in the AM does not disappoint.  Right off the I-10 so it is convenient.
