5 This is the greatest store I have been to in awhile!!  Great selection that changes so often and always great quality. You can't believe the prices!!  And it's all for a good cause too!  Do yourself a favor and make this a regular stop!
5 this place has the prices of a thrift store but the feel of a Boutique! The selection is fabulous if you love designer clothing! I have walked out with clothes and shoes that originally retailed for hundreds of dollars, and paid maybe 10 percent of their original cost! Oh,h and did I mention the staff is super nice, and all the money spent goes to help animals. It doesn't get any better than this!
5 If you are looking for a bargain on beautiful designer clothing, shoes and handbags, you have come to the right place!!!   The shop is really cute.  New items are donated every day, so you never know what treasures you might find.  AND...all of the proceeds go to helping homeless pets in need of medical attention!!  It doesn't get much better than that!
4 Rescued Treasures is a nice addition to the neighborhood.  It's a little boutique type thrift shop with all the proceeds benefiting PAC911, a local non profit that helps animals in foster care with medical expenses.  The shop has some really cute stuff and a little twist with it's boutique feel.  I will be visiting often especially since the inventory changes so often.  I highly recommend you pop over, at least to check it out!
5 I love this place! I am a huge animal lover and I love a great deal. I drop off all my clothing/home goods here that I don't need anymore and I always feel so great that I am helping animals with their healthcare. The ladies that work there are always so appreciative of my contributions and thank me profusely. I have also purchased some great items there. I have purchased gently used Nine West shoes, books, ornaments and more! All very inexpensive and contributing to a great cause! Please go there and see for yourself!
