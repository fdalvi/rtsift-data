5 They saved the day!    I was on a trip to Las Vegas, and well, I get off the plane, and I notice the bottom of my shoe heel was gone - being the *snazzy* packer that I am, I only brought one pair of shoes - the ones I was wearing.  We were driving to a soccer tournament, and boyfriend saw the sign of dry cleaning and shoe repair - so, we walked in.  Not only were my shoes fixed in 20 minutes - they were polished and the scuffs repaired - looked good as new - and I wear these heels pretty much daily.  I was happy I didn't have to go shoe shopping in Vegas and break in new shoes on the Strip!  Thank you for saving my vacation - I appreciate it!
5 I have been using their services for years. Service excellent- prices good. Today I brought a pair of boots in to repair a zipper- Varto was extremely honest- said that it did not pay to do the repair because of the price he would have to charge. and  tha I would not be satisfied with the look of the end result! WHAT HONESTY! Highly recommend him..
1 This place is a rip-off.  Park Avenue Cleaners are one of the most expensive around with an awful customer service. I was quoted one priced and was tripled when I picked up my clothes.  The lady working there had the nerve to insist repeatedly  that I heard wrong, as if I couldn't understand English or was senile.  On top of this they left soap stains on one of my dresses.  I'm never going back to this place and suggest you look around for other cleaners with a better price, they are many around this neighborhood.   If you go with them, make sure to get the price on writing before you leave your clothes with them.
