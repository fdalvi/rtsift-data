4 Wow, new Little Ceasars just opened up and had to try it out.  Looks really nice and clean inside, the staff was super friendly and the pizza was great.
3 Sometimes you just want to feed the family fast and for under $10.  That's when we stop by and get a HOT N READY cheese pizza and bread sticks.  No, it's not the best pizza in the Valley, but considering it's less than $6, it's decent....and no, it's not always READY, but I can wait 3 more minutes for a fresh pie.  The people here are friendly too.  A OK.
1 Simply the worst wings I've ever tried in my life.  Just awful.  They were rubbery (do they cook them in a microwave?) and small.  The "butter" garlic sauce was some sort of petroleum-tasting margarine that even my dogs weren't excited to chomp on (and they eat their own poop).  The lemon-pepper wings also had a very strange artificial taste to them, and equally rubbery.  The pizza is pretty much just a huge pile of bland dough with minimal amounts of toppings.  They must use a high-precision laster to cut pepperoni that thin.  I wouldn't take it as free food.
2 There was a hair baked into my pizza. My crazy bread had literally no seasoning. Very disappointing. Went back to explain, they have me a new pizza which was fine but the second crazy bread they gave me was worse then the first one! I want CRAZY bread not dull bread..
