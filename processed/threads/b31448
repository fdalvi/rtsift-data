4 I am a huge fan of their store... They have great deals, for women, womens plus, shoes and kids!! I go about once or twice a month! I like that they have plus size for juniors and their shoes are sooooo cute and fun! They will be opening up a new shop off craig and rancho next to T.J Max and Bath and Body works!! I am very excited so i dont have to go in the ghetto... lol   4 stars because the cleanliness is not the best but i love the clothes :D  Also have military discount!!! :D Gotta love those who support our men and women of the country.
1 So when i first went into this store i thought it was great, they had super nice clothes at an affordable price for plus size.. but theres a reason the clothes is so cheap, after about a week of using their jeans the button fell off, the stiches are coming undone and the little design in the back is falling off, the shirt i bought has a hole in it, and my sisters dress, the top hem is coming off, very disappointed, had high hopes but they were crushed when all the clothes i bought fell apart! Would not ever buy from again and do not recommend to anyone unless you want an outfit for one or two nights!!
1 don't ever shop here. the service is terrible! my sister got some heels right before they were going to close and she came home only to see that they had been used before. we came back the next day and said that my sister HAD ALREADY USED THEM HERSELF! they refused to help us in anyways, they refused to trade the shoes or give her the money back. we had to get the cops involved because they also refused to give us the number of the owner. terrible shopping experience! please avoid!
1 Worst shopping experience ever. The security guard was sitting on top of a ladder cursing while talking about soccer with a female worker.two boys that belong too one of the workers were running around like they were in a playground. Most unprofessional store ever.
