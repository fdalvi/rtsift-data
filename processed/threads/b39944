5 Place is clean, looks new, server Liz was great and food was really good had a grand slam. Asked for the bacon to be really Krispy and I didn't have to send it back... Just for that I'm impressed, my gf asked for black coffee and the server didnt ask "cream"? So obviously they hire people with some form of intelligence.
4 Generic Ihop food, cheesy corporate surroundings, but bolstered by outstanding service that elevated a 2.5-star experience to 4 stars. On a previous visit here, the music was so loud we couldn't hear ourselves think, but no such problem this time. Good overall experience for a "chain" breakfast.
5 Every time I come here the place is clean food is hot fresh and fast. I have never had a issue here or slightest to a problem. The waiters " usually female" love my kids and do anything to make them happy and smile. Regardless if that's their job you can alway tell when something is genuine.
2 From the un controllable LOUD kids, their running around, crawling under tables, to the WAY too close booths. I am honestly bummed about this place. If parents don't control their kids, staff should ask them to quite down. I wont be back, to that location at least.
4 This IHOP is on point. Service great. Our server checked on us regularly, but the food did take forever.
3 I was craving pancakes so me and another friend decided to go to IHOP. The one near ASU was closed so this was our last or closest resort. Right when we walked in it was full blast on A/C. I love A/C, but man I was freezing, lol. The customer service was ok. It took about 15 min. to get us our drinks. The food came out in a timely manner, but I didn't like the crispy chicken salad I got. Crepes with strawberries was good. Overall it was alright even though the service was slow, but it looked like there was only one waitress there.
