4 Little gourmet food store which features speciality European foods and ingredients  and showcases the celebrity chefs of The Cosmopolitan. Cookbooks, Kitchen equipment, Tools, DVD's, etc. Hard-to-get Greek Wine and other wines from Europe and here in the US are available as well. There is also a cool Bar Set in the form of a huge suitcase that will set you back $12,000.....ALOHA!!!
5 I don't really understand this place's function, but I was there on Thursday for a free event from the Cosmopolitan... a four course wine and food pairing.  How can you beat that?  Tried some wines, had some (tiny) portions of food, and got to socialize a little bit.  Cosmopolitan is easily my favorite hotel/casino right now, and this place is a great hidden jem!
