5 I don't usually write about franchised all over the place store, but I know i HAVE to write one for this Aldo shoe store. I don't recall the last time I was this satisfied shopping.  I guess Aldo's shoe sizes varies a lot with the different styles. My sister went and tried on at least 10 pairs of shoes (that means the store person walked in and out at least 8 times). She ended up not wanting anything. The store person was very nice and didn't give attitude at all. I then saw 2 pairs that I want. While i'm usually size 7 (or 37).. I ended up trying on 37,38, and a pair of 39. She didn't lose her patience at all.  I am totally going back for more Aldo shopping if I ever go back to Vegas!
4 This was their ACCESSORIES store.They didn't have their shoes :(  But cute purses, hats and jewelry! :D  I like ALDO. This was a good store. Sales (buy one get one free, 50% off, etc)!!! Love it.
5 Sort of Like Claire,s on steroids, and much hipper.    Small space, so hyper trendy for each season.  Love the rhinestone bracelets, and my new fringy handbag that already got me great hip cred.  I just realized thatPlanet Hollywood has a style...I guess I lived inHollywood so long, I thought it was just regular..It,s LA style!  Hot hip and lots of fun affordable bling!
4 This review is for the Aldo Accessories store at PH.  I always make a point to visit when I'm in Vegas, and I always score.  For sure, this is throwaway fashion, but it's fun to live in the moment!  Great trendy jewelry and bags for a night out in Vegas, and the price is always right.
3 I didn't find other reviews accurate.  The store is decent sized and carry mens and womens shoes, as well as purses and accessories. Perfect if your dogs are tired from being in heels and you need some relief, found a good selection of affordable flats and sandals, some on sale even.
