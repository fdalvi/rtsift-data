5 Today was the second time I used the services of Fluffy Tails Salon in Ahwatukee.  I originally chose this groomer because of  its excellent reviews.  They have lived up to their reputation!  Service is great!  Employees are kind, attentive, and professional!  The rates are very reasonable for the quality of work they provide.  I encouraged staff to have bumper stickers made for advertising the business, and I would definitely put one on my vehicle!
5 A friend of mine told me about Fluffy Tails Pet Salon. So I made an appointment last week for my Standard Poodle and WOW she came out beautiful, she was very happy, jumping around, excited to see me and was kissing the groomer when we left. Its cost me $58.00 dollars for a full groom and the tip. I recommend Fluffy Tails Pet Salon, Give them a try You will be very happy you did.
5 I brought my Maddie to this groomer today and couldn't be happier. They listened to my inputs about what I wanted done with her hair (a trim, but not too short like a puppy cut) and did a good job. They finished pretty quickly and called me right away when she was waiting for me to come pick her up. The place has good energy and you can tell they have fun with the dogs.
5 Service was outstanding! I am so happy I finally found my groomers after a year of bad experiences. My two Yorkies look fantastic. The two ladies who helped me were so kind, friendly, and caring - just met me and my dogs and they made me feel as if I've been coming here for years. So kind, thoughtful and accommodating and my dogs just look feel and smell great!
