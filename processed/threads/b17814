5 This place is an old favorite of mine.  Maybe I haven't been to enough hookah joint, but I appreciate the smoke, food and dancing.  I think Mr. K is tripping saying that he can't tolerate 19 year olds or Ja Rule. Ja isn't my favorite either, but come on Bee, are you that old and crotchety that you can't stand a bit of loud music? If that's the case why don't you get the 30-somethings at work to chip in and rent a conference room at the holiday inn and rent a hookah for the day.   Alternatively, if you are really tripping about Ja Rule that much you should quit whatever job you have and go and work for Interscope, (Tony Yayo is gettin gold). I mean, really! Plus a Duran Duran reference, really?!
2 I'll have to go with Mr. K on this one, a definite pass.  There are three other hookah lounges all within a half mile of Oasis and they are all worlds better than this one.  Go to Urban Cafe or even King Tuts, just anywhere but here.   The food is mediocre, nothing stood out one way or the other.  The music was a little annoying, but I'm not really into pop music or hip-hop, but I suppose people who are would enjoy it.  However, the service is absolutely terrible.  I've been there twice and on both occasions the (extremely late) delivery of food saved me from walking out the door.  Their hookahs are not good, and you practically have to tackle an employee if you want more coals.  Save yourself the frustration and go to Urban Cafe or King Tuts.  Urban is a bit more for the mediterranean loving, less-frills crowd.  Tuts if you still like your hip-hop and being surrounded by ASU students.
