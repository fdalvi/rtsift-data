5 Came in on a lazy Sunday. Very slow day, but they work fast and efficiently. Took my nephew to get a cut and he requested a faux hawk. And the woman that did it(forgot her name, sorry! :[   ) and she did a great job. He looked so handsome. The salon is definitely kept clean which is also a plus. And the ladies that were working were very sweet. Will be back for sure.
5 Today I went to Super Cuts and had my hair cut by Sandy, I usually don't write reviews, but after spending time in her chair today and leaving with my hair looking great, I want others to know about her, she is good at her job and is a kind easy going person. I will be returning for my next hair cut, of course with Sandy.
