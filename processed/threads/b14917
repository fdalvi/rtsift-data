5 Great little flower shop, they sell fresh and beautiful flowers.  Definitely going to be returning for more flowers.
4 I had a great experience.  I walked in the door of this little flower shop and squeezed my way through the very small aisle.  Looked in the cooler and saw only a couple of arrangements.  The manager came out and I told her what I wanted and she was able to create a quick bouquet for a very reasonable price.    Just tell the lady what you want and they will make it right there.  I love it!  I will use them more.
1 I received flowers today from my best friend for my birthday. She ordered them through FTD and they were delivered by Flowers 2005. I sent a photo of the arrangement with a thank you text to my friend and she called me immediately letting me know that was not what she order. The arrangment consisted of 6 gerber daisys, it looked like a $5 bunch of flowers from Trader Joes with extra greenery. An embarrassing situation for us both, glad we are such great friends. Unfortunately, being new to town and knowing that this is what I can expect from Flowers 2005 I will never order flowers from them.
4 Found their site online for Valetine's day. Great arrangement that the girlfriend loved. Delivery was $10 but I opted to pick it up as its around the corner from the house. Will use them again.
1 What a joke, I saw the rating and thought this would be a good place to get flowers last minute and when I showed up, the store was closed. The lights were on and the sign said they are open until 6pm but clearly they weren't. What good is it if your store is supposed to be open and it's closed during business hours. Went out of my way for this place too.. Can I give no stars please?!
