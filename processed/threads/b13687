1 DOES NOT HONOR APPOINTMENTS.  I scheduled an appointment TWO WEEKS in advance for a detail on a Saturday.  The Friday afternoon before the scheduled date Dave calls me to see what time he can clean the car *that* day.  I reminded him that the appointment was for the next day.  He then told me he couldn't do it Saturday because he was doing a different automobile.  Nice huh?  So...I reminded him that was why I made an APPOINTMENT more than a week in advance.  He didn't even try to correct the situation.    So...thumbs down "Dave" - no $ for you.  I hope your other customer doesn't flake on you in the same manner.    You totally jacked up my weekend plans.
1 they are the worst car detailer in town,  they burned my paint and caused swirls in paint like crazy..  i will never use them again...
5 I have never had such a good detail an any car I've owned. James and Mat spent over 3 hours on it. They used a 3 step process to first clean the paint with a clay bar then wax it and finally apply a sealant. it looks awesome. The interior is like a new car and all the cracks and crevices are clean. it hasn't looked like this since it came off the showroom floor. They will be getting my GT convertible next month and I won't call anyone else as long as the job is as it was today
