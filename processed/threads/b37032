5 I bought a five piece set of equipment from Tahoe Power and so far so good! I kind of expected some of the smaller pieces to be lacking in quality but I was very pleasantly surprised once I got to try them out.  As soon as I started pricing out generators I knew I got a great deal. This stuff is worth the money.
5 This is great stuff!
5 I recently bought the Tahoe 7000 series diesel generator for my business. I couldn't be happier with the product, it works great and I feel like I got a great price! Thanks Tahoe Power
5 I purchased 5 pieces of Tahoe Power Equipment (Generators, Compressor, Pump and Pressure Washer) from a guy who came by the shop with a pickup truck load full last year.   I couldn't believe these were actually Honda engines at the price I paid, so I called the Honda Distributor for Florida in Orlando (Robert's Supply) to have them run the serial numbers.  They checked out fine with Honda, and Roberts confirmed the 3 Year Warranty was valid on the engines.   I've used all the pieces a good bit in the shop, especially the air compressor, and have had no problems or need for service.
5 My power got knocked out in Jersey last year during Sandy, but all the stores were sold out of generators.  I heard about a guy set-up in a restaurant parking lot selling generators, so I  stopped by and bought a Tahoe 8000 Gas Generator from him for $2450 ( him name was Zack, nice guy).    My power was out 12 more days, but that Tahoe Generator ran like a champ 24/7.   I already loved Honda engines because of my lawn mower, but I couldn't believe how quiet and smooth the GX390 ran on the Tahoe Generator.   Thanks guys for putting out a great product at an affordable price, when others were out selling junk for not much less.  p.s.. I moved to Florida this year to get away from the hurricanes!! :)
