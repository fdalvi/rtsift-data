5 Great place to get some delicious Mexican  treats. Will be back soon to get some raspados during this hot weather.
5 Awesome.
5 Coco raspado was great! Staff is friendly, they are interested in products that the customer wants. If you have a favorite Mexican snack, they'll try to make it for you! Coming back soon for a bionico!!!!!
