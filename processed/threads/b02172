2 Blech. We ate here over a year ago when we first moved here...never to return. It tasted like "Mexican" food you get in Kansas. Low quality and not very authentic. Sorry...didn't care for it at all.
4 I'll be honest, I wasn't particularly impressed the first time that I ate here 2+ years ago. Since then, I've gradually come to really enjoy the food here, and we have gotten an explanation as to some previous inconsistencies with the food here at a certain point in the past (management/cooking staff changes were made). I normally order a two taco combo plate (the shredded beef is what I opt for), and they're pretty good. What really makes this place a win for me personally is their queso dip and their salsa. I swear, I could eat just chips and salsa/queso and be happy if I had to. Anyway, if you're in the Anthem area, this is one of the better options if you're looking to get away from the typical chain restaurant dining that plagues that area.
1 This place is disgusting! I've tried it multiple times over the past 10 years and still it is truly awful. I keep hoping they'll figure something out for the better.
