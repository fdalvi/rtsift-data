4 Yum! Chipotle!  One just opened up on the corner of West Sahara and Fort Apache, where the old Blockbuster used to sit. Today is opening day and how can I resist a visit? I swing by around 8:30 after work to find a line around 10 people deep. There are a few tables being used by patrons but mostly people are ordering to go. The inside looks like every other Chipotle. Granted it was super clean since today was the grand opening.  I ordered the Chicken burrito ($5.85) and a Barbacoa Burrito ($6.10) for a friend. The line process did take a little bit since the employees were new. Give them a week or two to get a feel for it and then the lines will probably fly faster.   The food is pretty consistent to every other Chipotle. What can you say? Its a chain restaurant! I'm definitely still a fan of Roberto's but I can see myself dropping by here once in a while.
4 Pros: HUGE burritos. DELICIOUS burritos.  Cons: Way too many calories.   Trying to lose weight right now, it sucks having to forfeit my Chipotle, but seriously, 1 burrito=2 lbs gained. Do deliciously huge portions always have to have thousands of calories.
4 Yes, I'm reviewing Chipotle.  Yes, they're a franchise.  Yes, they're owned by McDonalds..You got a problem with that?  Suck it.  If you've been to Chipotle before, you pretty much know what you're gonna get here: a ginormous burrito bursting at the seams, which is why they wrap it in tin foil!  I've never had a bad meal at ANY Chipotle.  I've never left unsatisfied and this franchise is no exception.  Yeah, I'm a creature of habit and I've only ordered the Chicken Burrito, but hey - Why mess with perfection?  I go here at least twice a week for lunch unless I decide I'm going to stick to my stupid diet (once a blue moon).  This particular franchise is always clean and the staff is always friendly and I trust them with my health and my palate.  Dos pulgares up, esse!  Tip: For some reason, whenever you order the chips and salsa, they get stingy with the salsa.  Watch them pour it into the cup and yell at them if they don't fill it to the rim.
1 Dear Chipotle,  Thanks for giving me unnecessary food poisoning! Your chicken tacos almost eviscerated my insides! Stomach cramps and vomiting really made my spring break memorable.   With love,  Mike
5 This place is very busy at lunch!  The place is clean and there are plenty of places to sit inside.  When tables empty out, I actually notice the employees are there moments later to clean up.  They also offer to take your trays and baskets.  I usually get the Vegetarian burrito: rice, black beans, fajitas (bell peppers and onions), pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, lettuce and corn.  My burrito comes bursting at the seams with this combination.    I've even had the person that wraps the burrito plead for help from her co-workers for another piece of foil.  Another plus is that they serve minute maid lemonade!  The employees at this area are very nice and professional and I enjoy their cheery disposition and enthusiasm.
4 I've had a Chipotle a couple of times, particularly at this location. This location is very clean every time I do come in. My boyfriend is a regular, so some of the staff already knows his order. They are also very welcoming when we do come in. The portion sizes are fairly large depending if you get the burrito or bowl. I always get the kids meal taco kit and that's good enough for me.  It includes what ever meat you choose, and two sides like guacamole or mild salsa, chips, and a drink. My boyfriend GTE's the bowl, you have a choice of two different types rice, meat, sides. The guacamole, chips, and meat are always prepared fresh. There's nothing really bad I can say, it can be busy at times, and if they're new workers they can tend to be slow with your order.
1 This is by far the most worst chipotle I've ever been too.  I just hated how none of the workers were friendly like any other ones.  Secondly they ran out of guacamole, and didn't apologize.  Bad customer service!! Very bad!!!
2 came here with my sister and her boyfriend for a late night crave for chipotle. yes, we're huge fans since i was a fetus. its my home chipotle, just down the street from my casa. we came when they were closing t minus 30 minutes. we were set to pay, when i asked for guac. they had less than an ounce left, so they said they were out. bummed. that guac is the icing on the cake. no biggy, just like they didn't apologize for it. couldnt leave because they already prepared my bowl. but as i was grabbing some napkins, the customer that was behind us also wanted guacamole, but the manager apologized to them offering a free side of chips and salsa. what?!  i don't know if they were too lazy to make a fresh batch. where's the customer service at? luckily i love their food, but i dont feel like dining in here ever.
4 Okay, I've been here twice now since learning from their website about the Chipotle commitment to "Food with Integrity."  What does that mean?  It means, among other things, that 100% of the chickens they use are raised without the use of antibiotics.  100% of their pork comes from naturally raised pigs that are fed a vegetarian diet and never given antibiotics.  And 85% of their beef comes from naturally raised cattle (only because the supply presently cannot meet the demand).    All this time, Chipotle was right under my nose and I'd been snubbing it because I assumed their food had no more integrity that Taco Bell's.    Now I've been this location twice within the last week.  The first time I got  a barbacoa burrito bowl with black beans and rice.  The second time I got the same thing with the chicken instead of the barbacoa.  Both times I was really hungry and could only eat about half of the meal in one sitting.  So I got two meals out of it for a reasonable price.  Both times, the food was delicious and I felt like I was eating a healthy, nutritious meal.    I also got, both times, the tortilla chips with guacamole.  Their tortilla chips are made fresh and have a really great, subtle lime flavor.   The guacamole is also made fresh.  This location is clean and well-maintained, and I have had no problems with the employees here.  They have been helpful and friendly.  From now on, Chipotle is going to be a regular stop when I want a quick, delicious, healthy and hearty meal.
4 This place allows you to select how you want it. You can have it as a burrito, or a bowl, tacos that are soft or hard, and even a salad. This place is great for a light, quick, simple meal that you know will be as natural as you can get it. And if you are watching carbs, this place can be a nice option.   Today I had the Carne asada burrito. I wasn't watching carbs this week, so I enjoyed the big stuffed burrito with extra chips and salsa. It comes with rice, your choice of beans, (I like black beans), you choose your meat, I got the carne asada, it's usually tender and seasoned well. I like the mild salsa, reminds me of pico de gallo, then I add the cheese and sour cream. That's a pretty big burrito!  What I like about this place is its commitment to quality, their products are natural and fresh and I know that eating hear makes me feel more healthy! (even if the burrito has way too many calories).
5 Our team enjoyed lunch today with many fine burritos and chicken tacos!  Great flavorful southwestern food in a hurry!  A+ service!  We'll be back!
5 I LOVE Chipotle! The staff is super sweet and most talk in Spanish. Its funny because they think I'm a gringa and I'm totally not, so when I speak to them in Spanish they get all giddy.   We went there today for lunch and I had a chicken burrito (like always) and man was it super yummy!! I also had some chips and guacamole which was excellent! I love how you can taste that everything is FRESH and not frozen! I also love the salt they have there; its like a lime sea salt.... totally delish!  The hot salsa is also super yummy and I always get extra! Beware because my bf said its spicy!
5 Wonderful food with fresh ingredients and a friendly staff make me frequent this place quite often.... I'm in a wheelchair and this place is very wheelchair friendly... This location is particularly nice because the ingredients can be seen from a low profile and I can see what I'm ordering in my burrito.. (  the location on Lake Mead however has a barrier I'm not able to look over ...but still a nice location )   I ordered the pulled pork burrito with Corn, Black Beans , Lime rice , cilantro and guacamole.... with a side of chips and salsa..... Nom Nom Nom... It was soooo good!! They packed a lot of stuff on the burrito...
5 Sometimes I find it difficult to eat Mexican food because I am such a picky eater. I do love tacos and nachos, but it has to be made simple. Unfortunately, I don't like beans, tomatoes, onions, jalape√±os, hot sauce, etc. For this reason, Chipotle is GREAT! I can order anything on their menu, just the way I want it! I like their fresh ingredients and watching the employees make my food. So far my favorites are the soft tacos and salad. Very delicious! Usually, I need at least a small amount of dressing on my salads, but I can eat this one without it!   I have only ordered take out at this location, but the restaurant has always been very clean and organized. The employees are very friendly as well. During my last visit, I ordered the chicken soft tacos. Although it looked like they had enough chicken to fill up my tacos, they kindly asked if I wanted to wait another 2 minutes for a fresh batch and I agreed.   I'm not sure how much healthier the food is here, but it sure is a better alternative to Taco Bell or Del Taco!
1 I hate this "restaurant".  Steam table meats and rice stuffed into a store-bought tortilla?  Yum!!!    Btw, rice does not belong in a burrito.  Especially in this case since it is pure filler.  They use around 3 ounces of actual meat in their burritos I'm estimating.  Their salsas suck and the hot-sauces are canned and I hate the fake branding,  So twee and cool and hip and unoriginal and appealing... to teen-agers.  I have a teen-aged daughter.  She loves Chipotle.  I've noticed that the more she loves something the worse it is.  There you have it...  This place is fake and bad and pure filler.
1 Will never come here again their rice was hard like always and the food was cold as usual hated it! !!!
3 I believe in second chances but I'm still wary of eating their meat. So I stuck to my favorite: vegetarian tacos. The beans aren't mushy, the fajitas veggies have crunch and flavor, and they're cheap. My lunch was under $3 (one taco and a water cup). I'm not big on heavy lunches so this was a quick bite and it satisfied me until evening.
5 I love chipotle and their food with integrity value. All restaurants should follow their example by only using meat free of antibiotics and hormones.  All of their food is delicious, and I'm happy that they offer a brown rice selection.
4 I have never heard of "Chipotle" before but my husband wanted to try it while on vacation in Las Vegas... It was surprisingly delicious! I got the chicken bowl with white lime cilantro rice, corn, and salsa. I didn't get a whole lotta "extras" but it was so refreshing. Maybe because we were in buffet gluttony and this was "light" compared to what I was shoving down my esophagus for the first 4 days of vacay. Oh, and it was cheap! Nice! They should open one in Hawaii :)
4 I've been eating chipotle for years and this location is one of the reasons!  I buy chipotle pretty much once a week, the bowl is very nice since its pretty much a salad that way haha!  this is a great lunch and its not super bad for you like say jack in the box is.    If you have never tried this then I would suggest getting a bowl and then see how you like the items that they have.
4 I love Chipotle. I know it's a chain and all, but they do what they do so well! In Northeast Ohio, where I'm from, the line will stretch out the door and around the corner.  Not so here in the Southwest, but that's to be expected, as there are more Mexican restaurants (pseudo and authentic) to choose from.  The fresh, organic ingredients at Chipotle are a real draw for me. But I admit, this is a "gateway "restaurant; when I'm falling off the raw/vegan/whole foods wagon, I come here because they serve fresh, organic, whole foods- so how bad can it be? But honestly, it's a slippery slope from here.    What I love about Chipotle is that their chips taste fresh, their guacamole is the best of all the chain restaurant guacamoles I've tried so far, and they season their foods nicely so that everything is very flavorful. I feel like I'm getting a good deal for my $8. Their menu is small, but that's fine- a bigger menu may cause them to slack off on the quality. Can't have that!!    I always get the Burrito Bol. It even tastes good the next day- just get the guacamole and sour cream on the side.
2 My wife loves this place, but I can't figure it out.  The food is fresh, atmosphere is kind of unique, but the food is BLAND.  I've never been wowed by anything.   It's healthy to be sure, but so are rice cakes and celery.   I much prefer Zaba's to Chipolte.  Your mileage may vary...
4 Always 4 stars.  It must be their delicious and mouthwatering steak. Its always so tender. i dont know how they do it. It had some good spices but my daughter always thinks its too hot. It doesnt taste like chain food, but i think its because its so fresh!  Their burritos have gotten a bit smaller but im not surprised with the economy and all.  Its still fairly reasonable for a steak burrito. 7.08 with tax! yesterday we went because they sent a B1G1 free :) Cant beat that!!  Perfection every time.. steak, cilantro rice, black beans, cheese, lettuce and sour cream. Don't forget the guac and chips! The chips are my favorite because they have that lemon zest taste.   Next time I'd like to try their salad. it looks fairly large without the carb'd tortillas.
4 Their barbacoa burrito is SO flavorful, I wish could eat this everyday ;-)  Service was speedy and helpful at this location. The music is a tad on the loud side and it's actually a bit chilly, but that's ok when your food is spicy.
5 I love coming here, the line moves quickly, the food is fresh, you can create anything you want from healthy as you want to, well anything you want.  Never had a bad meal from Chipotle.
4 Usual Chipotle.  However, this establishment has a bit of a smaller footprint than most.  Also interesting is that they actually use a not-so-spicy corn compared to some others that I've been.  The big thing here is that they pretty much use free-range everything.   I know it sounds silly, but there was an article in some business magazine a few months ago that basically wrote about how their meats taste better due to this shift.  And they do!  Also, if you've never been to this chain, they make pretty much everything from the meats to the guac fresh.  I've actually had to wait on guac to be made before at another chain.  I personally recommend the burrito bowls.  Less mess since you can eat it with a fork.  But, that's just me.
4 Ok...I love Chipotle.  It's pretty hard to mess that up.  I'm a super huge fan of being able to coach the exact distribution of the ingredients going into my burrito.  The cilantro-lime rice just makes the burrito.  Doesn't matter if you add the super yummy, well seasoned, chicken or the melt in your mouth carnitas...The food is always great.    The only reason for four stars vs. five stars is the physical building.  The actual dining area is much smaller than most Chipotles that I've frequented and the vibe here felt a bit different too...Don't know quite how to explain that one so I know it's not much help.
4 I have a love hate relationship with this place.  I think their prices are fair for their burritos and for the guacamole and chips and they give you a good size portion of guacamole which I really like.  I like that they have brown rice now and I really enjoy their salsas.  But my BIG HUGE COMPLAINT with them is VERY simple.   GET A WHOLE WHEAT TORTILLA!!!!!!!!!!!!!  How can a place that a prides themselves on healthy, organic, fresh made blah blah blah not have a wheat tortilla??? They only have white flour.  Yet right across the street from them at Rubios (which I LOVE) has had wheat tortillas for years now.    Sorry but if you want a 5th star from me, get whole wheat as an option.
4 Good food, great service! And i love that chipotle uses responsible suppliers.
4 Great Burritos here. Made however you like with a nice variety of toppings!! For instance corn, guac, n' chopped tomatoes. Always fresh and made on the spot. Service has always been very acceptable here...
2 I've been here a half a dozen times. My girlfriend loves this place. Me, I guess I'm just not a fan of their food.  Place is always clean, staff is friendly and the line moves quickly.  There food just doesn't do it for me. But give it a try if you like Chipotle.
4 If you are a Mexican of heart, then I probably won't recommend you to go to the Chipotle. This is a Mexican restaurant with an "American fusion"  lol... Although, it is not 100% authentic Mex is  great for the buck. You cannot go wrong with any item from the menu; they offer burritos, tacos, salads and bowls (my favorite). You can select the type of meat, the spiciness of the sauce, white or brown rice, pico de gallo, corn, sour cream, cheese, well you get the point!  Fast service so you will be in and out of this place.This restaurant is great but, I wouldn't recommend it as a spot for your first date! lol
4 Good little lunch favorite. After a meeting at the local Starbucks I popped in to grab a veggie burrito bowl not a vegetarian but too cheap to pay a $1.80 for a scoop of guacamole...its the principle! Plus I need to control my meat intake anyway :)  Chipotle never disappoints the food and service is always very consistent they do a phenomenal job of training. Although I have to say this is the 1st time I have ever been in one with a dirty bathroom.   I truly hate this bathroom's must be clean. However in their defense the reason it smelled like urine is because clearly this was a person's 1st encounter with peeing in a toilet...word of direction to this person wherever you are.  The urine goes in the toilet not on the floor around the toilet...come on people.   However, no excuse Chipotle monitor your bathrooms better and keep it clean.
4 As good as it gets for slow carb. Love the Barbacoa burrito bowl!
5 Friendly place with great food!
3 Solid place for tasty eats.  The guac is very good and goes with everything.  :)  Most people are familiar with Chipotle, so I don't feel the need to write a lengthy review (for once!).  Let's just say that if one wants a quick, relatively healthy meal, choosing Chipotle is better than most places.  Select your form (bowl/salad/burrito), your meat (if desired), and your toppings and you're good to go.  Ol√©!
1 So nasty THERE WAS BLOOD ON MY STEAK BOWL!!!  I was so disgusted and the customer service is terrible they stood around talking for 5 minutes before helping me and the cashier was clearly intoxicated and had a strong liquor smell on her breath.  MY VISIT WAS HORRENDOUS I WILL NEVER GO THIS CHIPOTLE EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!
5 Great food and fast great service. Cafe rio is also good in the same shopping center.
5 It's chipotle, so you know what you're getting, the food is solid, healthy or indulgent as you want it to be. The only reason  even putting a review up is because this location is well run, clean, and has great friendly staff.
5 Chipotle. self explanitory, no advertisment needed.... its simply amazing.  The rice  bowl with double rice, with that savory chicken ( of course you need to have a double serving!) Im not sure what seasoning is in the rice and chicken but the combination of the two mixed with the shredded cheese, pico de gallo, and the homemade Guacamole! doesnt even matter if theres an up charge. its that good! The location of this Chipotle is close to the house, the staff is friendly, and the are sure to keep everything fresh and timely. great experience everytime. my only complaint is... well  there is none. definitely top 5 things I'd want stranded on an island.
3 Your average Chipotle. I like the idea of Chipotle, but all the meat options are too spicy for me (though to be fair, I'm a wimp with spicy). But it's a great option for the Slow Carb diet. The food is great (if a bit spicy) and they worked us through the lunch time rush quickly.
4 Good food for the money.  I like the fact that I can stay relatively gluten free and still have good food.  I love the quality of the meat... and my favorite is the barbacoa beef.  Can you believe McDonalds owns this?  It's actually responsible eating!
5 Services is amazing!! Food we all know is good but the sevice is always great, thanks guys!
5 New respect for Chipotle - their mini series is funny & will raise awareness of US's ridiculous lack of attention to our politics effect on quality food supply.
5 I have probably been here more than 20 times & and I have zero complaints about this. Food taste like No other. I always get the chicken burrito or the steak burrito & and I get pretty much every topping you can possibly put inside the burrito. Haha hey why not. For $6.50...there's no any other place will fill you up like this. I always have leftovers to  take home.
5 I love this place. Customer service is always superb and the food is great. I have been here many times and will continue to be a dedicated customer.
1 Placed my order on the application got there it was not ready had to wait for them to make it. What was the point of using the application if I have to wait? The Arroyo crossing location had my food waiting and ready for me when I used the application before. After waiting at this location my food was horrible the chicken is burnt and crispy yuck!  The vinaigrette for the salad was extremely salty. This location is right near my house but after this experience I won't go back. The Arroyo crossing location is way better!
4 Easy to order, create any meal that you would like, range from taco to burritos. Service is very friendly.    I ordered a chicken bowl, the chicken was tender, and the salsa was refreshing.  The Rice was cooked well. Although the tables were not clean, and the condiments were dirty.
4 For the price of the food the meal was filling and delicious, the burritos are huge and assembled to order, the people behind the counter were fast and consistent and quick!
5 I absolutely love this place, I've been going there for about 4 years. February 2013 I went on a Chipotle diet and lost 40 lbs eating nothing but there wonderful fresh foods. I've gotten to know all of the employee's and management along the way and they treat me like 100% family.  Special shout out to Bree & David! I also love love love the biodegradable packaging used.
3 It's Chipotle, what do you want?  The chicken was a little fatty.  I will say that for $1.95 extra, and they will let you know this every single time you ask for it, is worth it as the helping is a pretty decent one.
5 wow! i had a card that stated that i get 4 free items from Chipotle (got from my friend). I called and spoke to a girl (think her name is Ruby) and she was SOOO polite and helpful! when i got there, i ordered 4 items and by check out time, i found out that my friend used 3 of the items! OH NO! i owed $24. Ruby came and understood what happened. even though i would have paid it, and asked her, "If she was sure?", Ruby went the extra mile and comped the rest of the meal! after thoroughly explaining the menue to me over the phone, and helping me decide what to get (never ate there before today) she paid for my friend's and my mistake by doing whatever she could to make sure that Chipotle gained another valued customer, which they did today! OUTSTANDING customer service, friendly and helpful staff, clean professional environment... what a great restaurant! DEFINITELY will return, no matter what the prices, just for Ruby!
