5 Saturday my little one was super sick, too sick to wait for the Doctor's office on Monday. We headed to NextCare Urgent care and walked in 20 minutes before closing. There were a few people in the waiting room and the person up front said they only had one doctor on staff and it could be an hour wait. I chose to wait, gave him our information and to my surprise we were back in a room in less than 15 minutes. Everyone was friendly, took great care of my little one, and got us out the door in no time. They even sent the prescriptions ahead to the Pharmacy of my choice so all I had to do was get there and pick them up without waiting. We don't plan on becoming regulars, it's not my type of place to frequent but it's nice to know when you need to go you'll be treated well. My little one is on the road to recovery, thanks NextCare!
5 Always in and out here and amazing staff
4 This urgent care was clean and quick! The ladies at the front were nice and were efficient. The nurse I had was great, called me sweetie, and I felt understood and cared for. The provider was great! Explained exactly what was going on with my symptoms, hooked me up with a breathing treatment and an injection to kick my asthma problems! I would go back in a heart beat.  Reason for 4 stars: price!!!!!
5 I really appreciate the option for me to check in while I am at home. Nothing is worse than waiting for hours when you are so sick. The staff here was nice, professional, and quick to help me.  I will be using this Urgent Care instead of FastMed whom I will never visit again. They also have eprescribing which makes getting the rx much faster.
