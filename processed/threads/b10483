3 It is dark, smoky, and filled with people who are local and older.  By pass the bar and push your way into the dinning room.  There you will find a little piece of the midwest in the hills of Vegas. It is down home and kind of comforting.   The service can be a little on or off but for $5.99 for a not bad steak is a hell of a deal. My favorite thing about the place is the ability to do low carb...and some of the best homemade country style desserts ever.   My friend swears that the steak and eggs with pancakes is heaven.   A nice surprise in a place you would never expect. Plus with Priscella's next door you can get all your hungers satisfied
2 Service is slow. food is passable at best. keep driving down the road better food is waiting for you
4 Yes it's a dark smoky bar, located in a strip mall, but there is one thing that really makes this different from the hundreds of other bars in town.  The food is great !  My normal is the club sandwich, in itself it is nothing really amazing, but throw is a quart or two of their honey mustard and I am in heaven.  The honey mustard is homemade, based on the receipt of the first restaurant manager.  The ribs are good to great, the service can be spotty, but is generally good and the prices are hard to beat.
4 What can I say? It's the place to get breakfast, for us. Super friendly staff, delicious food. We are in and out in a matter of 20 min. Never a problem.
1 I ordered wings and fries, they were the worst I have had in a long time. Very small and hand a pastey after taste. My carrot strip had more flavor.  We also ordered two beers.  Draft but they don't offer draft. My total for this $19.07. I paid 19 too much. We got 10 wings sent back 4 . I will not be back
