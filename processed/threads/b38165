5 Our doggies give their paws of approval!   My Bichon's love Jan, Owner at JJ's Mobile Grooming. That's why we have been happy to be using JJ's for 2-1/2 years and are completely satisfied with her work.   As requested, Jan does a puppy cut on the dogs, clips their nails and brushes their teeth. They come back smelling and looking great, and best of all they are happy dogs when they're all done (and it helps when she spoils them with doggie chocolate chip cookies ).  Our dogs have never been returned to us with a nick or cut, and they're groomed perfectly every time.   Jan genuinely loves her business and the dogs, and it shows in her work....I won't let anyone else groom our doggies!
5 I just used JJ's Mobile Grooming today for the first time; my 13 year old Lhasa Apso no longer can go to the regular groomer as she is going blind and is has become too stressful for her.  I gave the background prior to the appointment to set the expectations, therefore, no surprises for anyone.  Jan arrived, in fact early (yeah!) and she spent a lot of time with my dog; did not rush her and allowed my dog to "settle in" at her pace. Jan do not "push" her or try to make her accept anything that she may not have been ready for.   Much to both of our surprise, Jan was able to give her a complete groom, we both thought maybe a bath at best.  My dog relaxed, felt safe and was not stressed at all.  I most certainly scheduled her future grooming appointment right on the spot.
