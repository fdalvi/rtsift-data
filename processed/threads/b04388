4 Went to the take care clinic where the Dr was great! He was very thorough, made a diagnosis, got my prescriptions and I was on my way to feeling better. I will go back to this location just for the DR.
4 Super fancy one. Very bright. The sell booze. They had Ink when I had a structured sellement and needed it now.
1 Very rude customer service. I had came to drop off and pick up a prescription for my son and noticed three boxes of diapers for 18.99 each. I go to pay and the rude man says it's 28.99. I go back to show him that there was more then one and it showed the price for 18.99. He replies "that's for another brand and I'm not giving it to you for that price" Could he have been any more ruder. I mean I know it was close to midnight and he might have been moody and tired but this will be the last time I step into this Walgreens.
