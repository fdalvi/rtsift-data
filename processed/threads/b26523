5 It's kind of funny that I'm reviewing this place when my wife is the one who found it and purchased a number of jewelry pieces from them (well, I bought a couple for her as birthday gifts technically) while we were in town for CES this year.  She initially bought her first couple of items from a kiosk in the fashion mall thing I believe, but then she saw this full shop on our way to lunch in the Venitian and had to stop in to browse.  They have really beautiful pieces with a wide variety of stones, gold types, etc.  And the really remarkable thing is that the prices are actually really affordable given the quality of the work and the presentation of the jewelry.  There will be one opening up in South Coast Plaza in Orange County sometime soon and I have no doubt that my wife will want to check it out.  Summary: Great jewelry at great prices.  The owner of this shop that is moving to OC next year was very friendly and informative.
4 They have a nice collection at the kiosk inside Caesar's Palace. Beautiful chains, pendants, ear-rings; ohhh the Swarovski crystals sparkle so much that you just can't resist trying something on and then eventually buying them. Service is top-notch; the ladies patiently showed all the collections until I took my own sweet time to select something that I liked.
