4 Amazing how many times I've been here when I'm not really an arts&craftsy kind of person.  Sure, I'd love to be.  I'm just not.    My favorite time was for a bit of an arts & Crafts work project - creating 1st, 2nd and 3rd place ribbons for the office olympics.  (And yes, they were hilarious.  And No, I don't have pictures.)  The ladies there have always been helpful when I needed it.  What I love most about this place is how it's more like an old Cloth World than a spiffy new Jo-Ann.  I'm sure one day this location will get the big make over, but I kinda like that it hasn't yet.  Then again, I've never seen more than 3-4 people in here at a time so it might not make sense for them to put the money in redoing it.  While it may not be good for business, it's nice to go somewhere that isn't so busy when you need a little bit of extra help.  Especially if you're just buying sequins and fabric glue on your lunch break.
2 Being in Scottsdale I really thought this store would be the same as the one in Arrowhead and Desert Ridge.....no. I walked in and thought I had walked into some sort of Joann's clearinghouse  or outlet store. Wow. Very uninviting. It looks like they moved into an existing warehouse and put zero money into making the store look nice. I didn't find what I was looking for and left without buying anything. I think I'll stick to the other two stores I normally go to.
