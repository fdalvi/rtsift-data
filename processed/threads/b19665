4 Yeah, Jack in the Box, 4 stars...So, where is my Assclown tiara? I intend on wearing it all day for reviewing a corporate giant like Jack in the Box. However, where does one get a real ice cream shake from an independent in less than 5 minutes? Maybe not the best testing criteria, but I intend on winning the argument because it is my review!    Seriously, Jack in the Box has maraschino cherries and real whip cream on their luscious chocolate milkshakes. I can't speak for anything else on the menu but if you are craving a chocolate milkshake with real ice cream- hey, they came through with the cherry and whip cream, I have no reason to believe its not real ice cream and not some strange milk solids and it taste like bliss. So, blow through drive thru, treat yourself to some real whip cream and a cherry!    Truth in advertising alone is well worth 4 stars.
4 I usually wouldn't write about a large-chain fast food joint like Jack in the Box.. but the conversation through the drive through was one I've never heard:  "Hi, I'd like the #2, no bacon and Dr. Pepper please."  "Ok, do you want any sauces with that?"  "Uh, yeah, ketchup."  ".........uh... What did you say?"  "Ketchup."  "Chicken?"  "No, KETCHUP."  "Oh..... okay. Can you do me a favor? Can you look on the screen and see if you're order is correct?"  "Yeah, uh-huh, it looks fine."  I drive up to pick up my food and the girl is trying not to laugh as she is putting my food together... She hands the bag over to me and says 'she put something special on there for you." I was like, ???... and said "What did she put on there?" (Thinking it was something nasty or weird). "Oh, she just a smiley face on your food". I look at the box that burger sat in and there was a smiley face drawn on top with a sharpie. OK.....   Did not know what to say to that. I drove away a little confused and laughing on the inside.
1 Your food service sucks and. Your personal can't do anything to. Help me.....  Really....   Wow..
