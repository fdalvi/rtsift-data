5 My son and his cousin has been going here since the summer and they loves it! They're in the boys class with Coach Daniel.... he's awesome! The girls at the front desk is always so nice & courteous! Definitely burns some crazy energy, teaches discipline, and has tons of fun all in one!Thank you Brown's!!!
1 Both of my children loved this place.  My daughter has been going here for years.  She loved it so much she chose to have her 6th birthday party here.  The issue is not the teachers, but the finance department.  We unenrolled the children on dec. 30th and made payment for January.  We were moving feb 1st and were too busy to keep up.  It's now the end of June and we get a collection call that we did not pay feb payment.  Rather than call us, they choose to ruin someone's credit over $125!!  Called the office and no one was there who could make a decision, nor could confirm or deny that we did or did not withdraw in December.  How do you run a business and not have a decision maker within a phone call?  When you send a loyal customer to collections, and ruin thier credit, one would hope a phone call would be made to avoid such terrible consequences.
