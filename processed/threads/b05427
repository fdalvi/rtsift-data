5 A completely brilliant store with literally...everything medical... you might ever need or ever imagine you might need (and dear lord, I hope not), but most importantly, a knowledgeable, helpful owner and staff who genuinely seem to care...
1 Customer service SUCKS!!!! Don't ask if they have restrooms" it's not for the public" but they want you to shop here! Thank Goodness there are other medical supply stores in the area.
5 This place has everything to fulfill your medical needs! Great service & a huge thanks to the employee who had assembled my purchase!
