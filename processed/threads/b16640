5 Excellent service. Very professional and reasonable prices. They were $600 cheaper than the next lowest bid and even did extra work on top of that for free.
5 I had Tree Amigos come out to cut down a fairly large tree in the backyard.  They ground the stump down, cut away most of the visible roots and stacked the wood neatly in a corner for future use.  Price was also lowest out of all the companies I called.  Highly recommended.
5 I'm new in town, and didn't realize that you're supposed to trim your palm trees in mid summer (late June/July) because they bloom during that time, and make a huge mess.  Tree Amigos was the second company I contacted and Mark Alberti came by and gave me a quote that was $10 less per tree than what I had been quoted.  They scheduled me for two weeks in the future (as they are all busy during these months) and they showed up as promised, and set to work in an orderly fashion. They trimmed all my palm trees, then cleaned up the mess, even using a blower to clean out the areas.  I was very please with how quick and clean they were. Mark is a real gem, and his workers are clean and hard-working.
