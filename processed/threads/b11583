4 Nice convenient  little gas station.  Its a post office, gas station and convenience store right down the street from where I live and the service is very friendly.  The car wash is pretty good too.  A lot better than some of the other ones in the area.
4 Gas is pricey here but what shell isn't. But it's good that you can use your Smith's reward for discount which makes it a bit cheaper =) They also have a drop off post express which is good. You can buy stamps and get flat rate boxes.
3 Only come in here for the post office, always friendly and helpful.
1 If you have any issues with the service, damages in the car wash or any other complaints,  be forewarned that they will never accept responsibility . Furthermore,  the store may have changed owners but the management is still the same and service has not improved. I have found them to be rude and unhelpful. Shop and stop there are your own risk.
