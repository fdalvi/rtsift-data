3 We went to the Pueblo El Mirage Country Club for dinner the other night with a group of 11.  Our friend was celebrating a birthday and wanted to enjoy the fish fry.   The facility is nice and I can see it being transformed into a very elegant location for a wedding. There are loads of tables and booths in the club.   The food was good enough. Nothing special. The Fish Fry is an all-you-can-eat fry and they do offer baked fish as well along with a choice of regular or sweet potato french fries. You also get a cup of coleslaw. The fish was largely portioned and the sweet potato fries were yummy. The coleslaw was very bland though.   Service is very slow here at the club though and that's what is keeping me from being terribly excited about it. We waited almost 30 minutes from the time of ordering for us to receive our appetizers and that's really not acceptable. The place was busy but I got the feeling that the wait staff just isn't trained well on time management skills. Our server did try his best and tried to get with the program but just couldn't seem to get his ducks in a row.   I will go back as the food was good and my husband and son are eager to give the golf course a whirl. Hopefully the service will improve soon!
1 The golf course is overpriced for the condition of the course.  I will not play this course again.  The greens are terrible and fairways are weedy.
