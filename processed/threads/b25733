5 They have a great crew working here. Range is always clean. I'm here once a week.
4 First time here today. Coming from the east coast and used to indoor, high dollar places I really enjoyed it. Safety is number 1 here! I had no problems with the rules or the range masters. They were very friendly and offered great advice when I needed it. Trust me, anyone with a gun can shoot here and I bet they have seen it all. They have inexpensive targets for sale ( mine were .30cents) as well as ones up to $4....your not required to buy. Expect to have a cease fire about every 20 minutes that lasts about 10 so folks can check/changle targets or distance. They provide solid (concrete) shooting benchs under cover. I had no wait on a Sat. afternoon. I will definitly go back when my next build is done.
4 Good sized range and a fairly cheap price. Kinda wish I could get an annual membership here. Pace of shooting is a little bit slower due to it being a public shared range of large size (necessary). They also sell paper targets at a very reasonable price.
