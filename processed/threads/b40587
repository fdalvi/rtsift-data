5 Visited recently. Nebula has a comfortable atmosphere and very friendly assistance. The tasting table is great. Loved the flavors - even though the selection was limited. Being able to try the flavors is a great plus. Limited selection of hardware - but what they do have is very good.
5 Great shop. Went in on a impulse yesterday to get new parts for my ecig and while their replacement parts did not fit the employees were so nice and considerate. Also they sell some good juice well worth the price. I will be back monthly
5 Amazing service. And they have my pink Manhattan waiting for me. They are always willing to answer any question I may have. And they actually remember there customers, which shows their dedication to customer service. Try the butter beer with caffeine. It's my new wake me up vape! I can't say enough good things about these guys that would do them justice.   *cough* white chocolate chai *cough*
