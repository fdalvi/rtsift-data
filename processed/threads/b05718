5 We loved this restaurant from about 1996-2006.  Around 2006, they closed their business to the public and only catered to tour buses.  They are now open again to the general public.  We went there for dinner tonight.  The chef/owner and waitress/daughter recognized us immediately!  We ordered the kalbi which was just as great as we had remembered.  The mandoo soup was also excellent.
5 I have no idea why there are so few reviews for this place. It's awesome! We came to the strip mall to eat at Tokyo Japanese restaurant, but it was closed. So we sauntered over to Lotus of Siam and they had a 2 hour wait. We then decided to see what the wait was like at Komol and it was merely half an hour, but we wanted to eat sooner rather than later. One of the guys in our group saw this place and my girlfriend was like "What does Yelp say?" So I looked it up and it was five stars, but only three reviews and the last one from 2012. We decided to try our luck and I have to say it was well worth it!  If you like Korean food you should definitely give this place a try!
4 Food was prepared very well, the value for the money was very good. the restaurant was very clean and the staff was very nice. I would definitely bring my friends & Family.
5 This place was amazing and had amazing food! The prices were great and the service was wonderful. Everything is served beautifully and I really enjoyed my meal! I will be coming here again!
