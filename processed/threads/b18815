4 Cool little Tahitian restaurant by the stadium.  Four of us came here for lunch, and I kept thinking "these are the prices all the time? not just lunch??"  It was great to feel you were getting a deal.  I got the coconut jumbo shrimp which turned out to be really, really coconut-y.  You order at the counter, get a number, and they bring it out to you promptly!  Someone else ordered the shrimp curry with the coconut rice and I tried the rice.  Instead of the standard coconut rice that I'm used to, which is rice cooked with coconut milk, this had shredded coconuts in it!  Definitely a good place for people who love coconut!  Two reasons why they lost a star: 1) when we ordered drinks at the counter, they guy automatically gave us disposable cups even though we were eating there; please try to be environmentally friendly! and 2) there were several menu items that came with salsa but apparently they've changed their menu so that it doesn't come with it; please update your menu or when we call you out on it, give it to us anyway!
3 I didn't really expect much from this place, but I think that the Ono's and other Hawaiian BBQs have this chain beat. I have to say that they at least saved me from spending way too much money on a light dinner when the rest of the restaurants were crowded and overpriced at WestGate.
