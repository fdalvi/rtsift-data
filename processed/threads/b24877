3 Standard quikimart except maybe a tiny bit smaller. There are 3 within 2 blocks of each other..so that was kind of random.  Awesome for cough drops, red bull (i was pretty much here everyday for red bulls..), and powerball lotto tickets.  People here are cheery and welcoming when you walk through the door..just wish they had better/larger selection.
1 One star is too kind. Slow service most of the time. Old tall thin lady slowest of all. Moves like she has all day. Didn't know the meaning of convenience store. It doesn't mean customers have all day to wait for your slow service. Move with some haste why don't you. QuikTrip is so far better. Like living in the white house vs. A trailer park.
3 This is a Shell  station although the Circe K sign is right below it.  Self serve, prices on the highs side but it is next to fwy and airport.
