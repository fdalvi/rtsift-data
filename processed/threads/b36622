5 I have been seeing this esthetician for almost 5 years -- that speaks for itself! She is is skilled, professional and amazing at what she does! The environment is clean,organized and welcoming. I strongly recommend this studio for all of your waxing and skin needs!
5 I did not think getting the skin-tags off of my neck and face was a big deal. Angela told me that it would. She is right! I look a few years younger and feel a whole lot better about myself.
5 The aesthetician who owns this studio and does all the work is superb! I've been seeing her for 7 years for waxing and skincare services. Skin doesn't stay the same all the time; it changes with age, seasons, etc. She always personalizes my skincare routine to fit my needs. Before seeing her, I thought I had done all that I could for my skin and struggled with acne and skin tone discoloration. However, she has done such wonders for my skin and I have referred multiple friends and family members to see her, which is the best compliment and thanks I can give her. I have gone to other aetheticians for waxing and facials to try it out and no one has been even close to the type of skill and professionalism she possesses. You should invest in your skincare no matter what age you are!
