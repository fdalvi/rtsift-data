5 This lovely shop is located inside the Promenade across from Nordstrom Rack. There is nothing better than a healthy smoothie after shopping. The staff is amazing and the drinks are healthy, high in protein and low in refined sugar- a combo you would be hard pressed to find elsewhere.  I highly recommend stopping by. I personally had the Gladiator drink with 45 grams of protein. It's perfect after a workout.
4 Smoothie beats candy any day. I'm a total smoothie freak. The menu is descriptive of what's inside the drink. Good flavor and usually not very busy so its easy to get in and out of there quickly!
1 BOO!!! They closed!
