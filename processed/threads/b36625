1 It's 11:30 at night went to check into the hotel after a long 6 hour drive an was denied a hotel room because I dot have a credit card. I explained to to him I had more than enough cash an he questioned me as to why I had so much an told me he couldn't do anything WILL NEVER be staying at a comfort inn ever again
4 Arizona mills is only 5 miles away.  free breakfast. swimming pool.  everything is in short distance.  rooms are cozy and comfy.  but one problem. they close the pool and the mini gym too early.  there free water tastes nasty. and the gym is too small.  only 3 machines. come on guys we need atleast 10.  people like working out now in days.   but other than that. the price is good for the stay.
