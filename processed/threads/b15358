4 U get 10% off when u spend more than $25...woohoo!
5 Breakfast? We'll see.
3 This is a hard one to rate.  It took a ridiculously long time to get 2 sandwiches and an order of fries to go. The restaurant was empty but there may have been a line at the drive thru. I sampled the fries when I got in the car and they were just room temperature.   By the time I got to the hotel (5 minutes away), the sandwiches were not hot either.  However, both of them (a double  burger and a ranch chicken sandwich) were quite tasty. So how's about 5 stars for the food and 1 for service?
3 This place is a mixed bag for me. The food is great, I love the grilled taste over McDonald's any day. The downside is that they constantly mess up your order. There's A 50/50 chance that if you don't check your bags they will miss a burgers, or 2 large frys. At least they have never given me a hard time when I come back but I live in Glenwilde and the last thing I want to do is go all the way back to get missing item(s) while my food gets cold and family finishes without me.
