3 Pretty good gelato, but it wasn't as creamy as I anticipated. I tried samples of the Burgundy Cherry and the Mascapone Caramel Pistachio. I wish I could try more gelato flavors, but I felt bad for asking. I should have tried the creme brulee since that was almost gone.   The Mascapone Caramel Pistachio was sweet with the caramel, but I didn't get a lot of caramel. In addiiton, the pistachios were soggy! The refrigeration must be really at Melt.   You can purchase the following sizes: - Cup gelato (see picture for size)- $3.25 - Larger cup - $4.60 - Take Out Size - Sampler size of  4 gelato flavors  For the price, I expected the portions to be larger. Oh well.  The guy worker had the most apathetic attitude. When I asked whether I could try something, I could barely hear the answer out of his mouth. Eh, I wish he was more excited about his job.   This place also makes crepes, smoothies, panini sandwiches, and drinks.  At least I had my sweet dessert for the day.
3 Came here with the husband and tried only the gelato.  I had the mascarpone caramel pistachio-good but missing the OMG factor for me.  The husband had double dutch chocolate.  I tried his and you could definitely taste the richness of the cocoa.  The cups they serve it in are about the size of Dixie bathroom cups.  They have to mound the gelato over the top which makes it a little difficult to eat.  I would have ordered a cone if I wanted to deal with that.  The gelato is good, and I will definitely come here again if I happen to be at PV Mall.  Otherwise, I will stick with Gelato Old Town or Gelato Spot for a better product.
