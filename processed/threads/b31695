5 Awww the staff here is wonderful they always know what I want and best of all they know my name which really adds to the experience! The drinks and food are amazing as well!
5 Going to echo the other reviews and say that the staff here is WONDERFUL! After a somewhat disappointing service experience at Nordstrom's, I was pleasantly surprised by the attentiveness and positivity of the guys that work at the counter. The E-bar is located on the 2nd floor by the entrance where Nordstrom's intersects with the main mall area.  During my short visit I ordered up my double shot of espresso and grabbed a snack box of cheese, fruit and crackers for later. Espresso was stellar and that snack box? I know this will sound slightly ridiculous but I still DREAM about it! It was the BEST SNACK BOX EVER!!! The lavosh crackers in it are tasty bits of heaven, the fruit was sweet and the cheese a perfect match. If you live in Scottsdale would you mind finding out who makes these and send me a few?   31 Yelps Challenge: #16/31
5 My first visit to Nordstrom's coffee place here in the mall and I'm impressed. Great service, just the right selection of coffee and food stuffs, and a reasonable price to boot.
