5 I was travelling from Minneapolis to Indiana with friends when our car broke down in Madison, WI at 10 PM. I called Triple A and they dispatched Prarie Land Towing. Shawn, the driver, tried to jump start the vehicle.  When that failed, he hooked us up and towed us in. Meanwhile, he called ahead to have someone at the shop prep a loaner car for us to use locally until the shop opened in the morning.  We called around 8 AM, but they didn't have a report yet, so we called to have a rental car ready. We asked about whether they were open on Sundays, because that was when we would be coming back through. Although not normally open on Sunday, they were willing to make arrangements with us so we could pick up the car.  At 10:15 AM, they called to let us know whe could pick up the car in 15 minutes. We cancelled the rental and were on the road by 11 AM. Because of the folks at Prairie Land Towing, we made it to our conference, arriving only a few hours later than we planned, but without missing any major events.  If you're ever stranded in the Madison, WI area, ask for Prairie Land Towing!
5 My fathers van broke down,so I called AAA and they sent Les from Prairie Land Towing to tow it home for us. He never hesitated to put it the driveway even though it was icy and kind of narrow...He even helped push the van further up into the driveway and put bricks under it so it wouldn't roll. I told him if we ever need roadside or towing assistance again I would be calling Prairie Land Towing and requesting him to assist us.Thank you again for your excellent service!
