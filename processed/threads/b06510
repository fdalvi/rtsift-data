4 Since Big Dog's went away, this has been our watering hole.  Good grub and drinks in a clean atmosphere.
4 Nice place drinks cheap & clean with a average bar box pool table
4 Small quaint little pub. The service is quick and the people are nice . Not the best sports bar as the TVs are small and the sound off . But nice place to kick it in north Vegas. The Beer is really cold and the food is good . Happy hour between 5-7 with pizzas half off.
2 Gaming, Darts pool table, food, and great staff. Its alittle smoky in there but its My pts
3 Good for watching football, it's like an uncles old 90's style bar. The chicken is good and the bartenders are cool. I'm excited to watch football here this coming up season. See you soon PT's
