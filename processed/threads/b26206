3 Blunt honesty is the best.  I despise when someone, anyone likes to beat around the bush. Especially in a legal matter.   I can honestly say that Reza Athari is one person that I would go to for my legal advice. He has a sense of humor and is very honest about what he can or can't do. He gets straight to the point.  One of the reasons why I am only giving 3 stars, the receptionist are sitting there gossiping.  I mean come on can't you wait until know one is in the office. I was that last one to arrive. Thus I was the last one to be seen,  All I hear was yak yak yak.   The other reason why they are getting another star taken is because of their god awful location. You are an immigration attorney and you are right next to the immigration office.(lol)  Plus They have relocated they used to be on the other side of the immigration office, now they are right next to it. (across the street)   Getting back to the nitty gritty I can honestly recommend Reza he is honest.
1 Just so everyone know Reza Athari workers have to write reviews for him to keep their job. He is a bad lawyer. You will pay your money and never get any service. I just thought I would write this, anyone wants to use him enter at your own risk because he will change the way you think of lawyers!
1 definitely not recomending it to anyone waste of time just to even visit his office  thats all i can say nothing more nothing less.
1 When they say the consultation is free they really mean it:  It's a consultation about the exorbitant fees you're required to pay upfront with absolutely no guarantees of success.  The wait time in the lobby was a lot and so were the proposed fees for the service.  I'd recommend a skip on this one, not even worth the mention.
