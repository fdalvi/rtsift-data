2 Live right next to this place and needed to grab some beer after getting home from the airport.  Usually liquor stores have a somewhat decent beer selection, but this place didn't.  No Blue Moons, no Corona Lights, nothing but the standard Bud, MGD, Coors, and Natty Light.  Skip this place if you're doing a beer run.
2 This Circle K, minus any gas, is not my favorite convenient store. Yes, it's definitely convenient for me, being so close to home, still doesn't mean I have to like it tho.  I really wish they would just redo the place. Its a pretty small Circle K and it could easily be a lot cleaner and not seem like it's falling apart. The people behind the counter tho are always friendly and each have their own unique (quirky) personalities.
2 No gas pumps and limited parking. The staff is nice though. I prefer stopping by Quick Trip.
