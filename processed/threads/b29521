5 Our situation: bought house, water heater needed replacement. ASAP on THANKSGIVING weekend. We went to the usual suspects: Sears, Home Depot, and Lowes. Sears install $400 and limited install dates, Lowes: $400 and limited install dates, Home Depot: fail. Went in store and they asked us to call the 800-home-depot number, couldn't get anyone on the phone.   NOW Plumbers: called, they answered AND they had same day (within an hour or two) installation AND were so much more affordable. For us this point forward, there are no other plumbing specialists but NOW for our family. Thank you Larry and Mike for saving our Thanksgiving!!
5 Amazing service! Mike is the best!
5 Installed new water heater and the results are excellent.  Sam is conscientious, reliable, thorough, knowledgeable and courteous.  Recommend you ask for him for plumbing services.
