4 I have never shopped at this location and was greeted with friendly staff.  Rhonda, a cashier there helped explain the gas rewards on the Fry's card.  She explained the benefits of having a Fry's card.  Looks like I will be using one. Every $100 in groceries is 10 cents off a gallon and every $500 is 50 cents off a gallon.  I never knew that, in regards to the gas savings.  I buy groceries, so might as well shop Fry's and save on another need I have, gas for my car.
2 Skip the produce section here unless you like rotting, I mean "ripe" fruit and surly produce guys from the midwest.  Surprising amount of frozen Vegan items, when they are stocked.
4 This is a nice Fry's. The staff are all very friendly. Avoid going during the day if you want to avoid the old people (nothing against old people, but too many of them and you're gonna have a bad time).
