2 4:25pm on a Monday.  Airport is pretty packed and there is one person trying to work the register and make coffee drinks...no chance.   Get the girl some help!
3 They are trying. Looks like Starbucks but little bit different. Coffee is great. I ordered a Venti late and was informed. "We are not Starbucks" well them make more of a difference!!! Same ol same ol...... Seating area great.
4 A surprising discovery at the Sky Harbor Airport! Took a friend to the airport, walked with her to the gate and realized there was still time before she had to go through security. That's when the aroma of coffee both hit us. Looked around and found Lola Coffee.  Doesn't have that burnt, over-roasted coffee flavor like some self-proclaimed coffee Star offers. Anyone with a sweet tooth will DEFINITELY like this!  I had the Caf√© Blanco and it was delicious!  Places with outlets to plug in a laptop for work and comfy chairs for relaxing. Service was great too. I will admit: there weren't many people around when we stopped. Might get crazy during traditional air travel hours.  Not a five-star 'cause we didn't order a meal or pastry (yeah, difficult to imagine that, but we were both full from lunch. I had a salad, which was shocking for both of us).  This will be my coffee fix anytime I'm at the airport.
4 This is ok. Not a place I will frequent though. Its a great place to get some work done without being bothered.
