2 The atmosphere is nice its very clean and well put together. Its kind of unfair to compare this Geno's to the real Geno's and Pats in Philly... Its safe to say its not even close but to be fair They just opened up and I've only been to this Genos once.   Now they do have more then just Philly Cheese steaks. So I'm looking forward to giving it another shot. But for now its only gets 2 1/2 stars.
2 I hate writing reviews that aren't glowing. But I don't think my sandwich was worth the over $7 I payed for it. There are other places in town that don't specialize in cheesesteaks that offer better. There wasn't enough cheese and the meat was dry. Service was friendly and the place is new and clean, but it felt weird ordering from what looked like a 10 year old at the register.
4 I would say I've eaten here about 5-8 times now.  I get the Grilled Italian Sub and I LOVE IT.    Yes, its a lot of change to spare for a sandwich but one large sub is easily shareable and they are loaded quality tasting meats.    The customer service has always been exceptional.  The tables and restrooms are clean.    Not many business give the persona that they actually want to please there customers, but here I really do get that impression.  Try it out once, order yourself a Grilled Italian Sub and you won't regret a single calorie or penny!
2 knock knock.....  who's there?  my half filled hoagie roll that I am knocking on.  I think that about covers it. well, if you're like my mom and needs jokes to be explained, here we go, Barney style: Large "famous" philly (provolone wit) good sized roll, but halfway filled with barely visible onions and equally absent meat and cheese.. whilst still hungry and bored I picked up the remainder of this roll and began knocking on it!  wah wah waaaaaah
