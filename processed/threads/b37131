1 Do not buy tickets online from Ticketliquidator or Ticketnetwork.  The actual tickets I ended up with were 50% of the value of the tickets I purchased onllne.  I thought I was buying a ticket worth $77/seat and paid accordingly.  When I downloaded the tickets they were actually $44/seat and we ended up in the rafters at the performance (Circle du Soleil).  They explained that they were just brokers and could not guarantee the tickets!!!!! Go direct!!! Do not buy from them.
1 Do not buy tickets from ticketnetwork! I bought tickets 4 months before a show and the tickets never showed up! Ticketnetwork told me there was nothing they could do to refund my money and I would need to contact the seller and my bank. AWFUL company!!
1 I got my tickets but the play was cancelled and they refused to refund.
