5 Amy's is a true "gem" in Casa Grande, a city where a lot of people would just as soon step on your face as look at you.  The shop itself has a great selection of what looks like quality jewelry, although I'm no expert. I wouldn't know a brilliant pear cut from a cubic macaronium. However, the service here is first-class. I have come in several times to make small purchases or get repairs. The staff is friendly, efficient, and clearly interested in the customer experience.   I mark a business like this by how they treat the small fries -- if I get great service when I come in to make a $50 purchase, I will give them the big sale when it's time. They understand this concept -- kudos to them.
5 Excellent customer service. I went in there recently for aid with a watch band (and the watch had not been purchased at this location) and the gentleman waiting on me went beyond the call of duty to aid me. I wish more people still believed in this kind of customer service. They will have all of my future business.
5 The boutique, jewelry, and Amy are all wonderful. Nice shop, good selection, and  even found some amazing finds, and Amy's helped by offering a great bargains. Getting married in two weeks, and both my fiance and I have had good luck and experiences with Amy's help.
