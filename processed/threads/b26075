5 This is a great locals bar, outstanding service, great drinks and drink specials. They even have an outside patio where they do special events and beer pong.
4 This bar rules! Ive been coming here for the past year or so and I have hit more jackpots here than anywhere! The staff is awesome and especially the day time bartender...he makes the best food and is always coming up with amazing tasty drinks! Do yourself a favor and check this place out...total local favorite!
5 Good service, great bartenders, amazing food specials. I win more here than anywhere else!  Every day there is a different special whether it be drinks, prizes, or gambling.  This is very much a locals bar so when you come in expect to be greeted with a smile.  Also great food here and around the area that can deliver to you.
3 I'm really bummed that this place closed.
