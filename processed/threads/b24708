5 Multiple shipping services available, friendly employees, fast service, products available.  I love not having to stand in line for 15-20 minutes at the Post Office! The UPS Store offers a variety of shipping options and will help you find the cheapest option. I've been in there probably four-five times in the last two years, and every employee has been very friendly and helpful. They also sell cards, supplies, poster tubes, etc.
5 They have been great from day one. I relocated to Phoenix and They started helping me prior to moving here. They  continued to help me after I moved here. They are very customer friendly!! The employees are pleasant to work with and very helpful.
5 Well here is a UPS Store that actually is friendly and cares about its customers.  I can't foresee this one being owned by the one on highland avenue because it's clearly two different types of service. This store seems to care about its customers!!
5 Oops. Posted review to wrong place and now I can't erase it on my phone.
1 This is the Worst place to get anything Shipped and Please don't believe a word they say. Tuesday Jan 14 I wanted to  Ship a small bicycle to Puerto Rico the young Hispanic kid behind the  Counter says its going to be over $400 dollars to get this shipped And some older Bald White guys says GEEZ that's a big  36lb package  Then he tells me the USPS won't even  Touch it ... Well guess what USPS did ship it and at a tune of $42.00  STAY CLEAR of these LIARS  It's really a shame I send packages all the time I was just trying them cause they are in my neighborhood .... I don't mind paying extra for the service  But 10 times the amount is a little much..
5 I've been a customer of this location since October 2012 AD. I ship about two packages every 90 days. I have nothing but good things to say about the service I've received at this location. Solid!
4 This place has been a life saver twice for me in the past six months.  In addition to all the UPS offerings for shipping, wrapping, greeting cards and office-related impulse purchases, they've got Notary Public service for $2.00.  Excellent.
