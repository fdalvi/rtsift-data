5 The best doctor I had in a while. Why? His staff, Nancy, is very friendly and always follows up very promptly on all treatments and lab requirements. Dr. Thai's style is very friendly, but always to the point, no sugar coating. I was in need for some lab results and x- ray and I have never seen anybody trying to negotiate the best prices for me like he did. Comparing to the Florida rates, it is just amazing how competitve the prices are. The same goes for prescriptions, he always advises you where to get the best prices. He never charges for follow-up calls, not even if those calls may qualify for a new diagnosis or treatment. If you want to experience what a real doctor should be like I warmly recommend Dr. Thai.

5 I've had a lot of doctors since I moved here in 2005, and coming from a small town in Michigan I'm used to having that doctor that listens, cares, and goes that extra mile to take good care of his patients. Well this doctor does that. He is very nice, takes the time  to explain things,talks about different options. He makes sure you are feeling well and will find a way to do that and make you better. I will be going here from now on.
