5 In the past I have been very disappointed in KFC. I found their chicken to be very greasy. We bought a bucket and there was a quarter inch of grease on the bottom of the bucket. This was at the KFC on boulder and Lake Mead in Henderson. They did the world a favor by closing that dump. One night my wife said that she was in the mood for chicken so against my better judgement I drove over to the KFC on Horizon. She wanted the two piece deal and after reading the menu I decided on the Pot Pie. Well we couldn't have been happier. The chicken was perfect and I loved the Pot Pie. Have been there three times now and I can't find one thing to complain about.
1 Ugh. Dear Colonel Sanders. It's a shame your ghost can't come back and give the franchisee of this KFC location a good swift kick in the derriere. I walked in here and noted that the place was cleaner than most KFC's typically are. But a clean restaurant doesn't equal good food, or a good value either. When we opened up our takeout food it was woefully disappointing and underwhelming in terms of quantity and taste.   I've stayed away from KFC restaurants for several years but when my wife said she wanted KFC, I went. I regret not telling her no. I flat refuse to go back to this KFC, and it will likely be many years if ever before I step foot in ANY KFC again.   1 Star is 1 Star too many.
3 I've been to this location dozens of time, their consistency is not there. This time both orders of chicken were dry, otherwise standard kfc.
