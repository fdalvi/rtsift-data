4 I recently had the pleasure of conducting business with Aesir and was very happy with the outcome.  It isn't often an armorer has both the artistic ability and the business sense to provide the quality of customer service that Mr. Demers does.    I was kept aprised of the status of my order, and once production began was given continual visual progress reports until the project was completed and delivered.
5 As you can tell from the pictures here, Aesir Metalwyrks has tremendous talent and vision when it comes to gorgeous and functional helms.  People trust their very lives to these pieces, so the quality and durability is the most important part - but the artistic touches make these truly amazing!  If you're a fighter in the SCA (or are close to one) and live in the Southwest, you probably already know Dave Demers and Aesir - so there's nothing new I can share here.  If you're not a fighter or don't even know what the SCA is, this is still a business to know and keep in mind!  A fan of Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers?  Check out their site for the logo trailer hitches.  Those were produced by Aesir, too!  If it's custom metal and you want it done, this is THE place to go!  No order too big or small, fantastic customer service and AMAZING quality product.  Tell Dave I sent you!
5 Best SCA armor
5 Dave is an excellent craftsman who takes pride in his great quality work. He undervalues his superb talent and is very friendly and helpful. I will be back for more.
