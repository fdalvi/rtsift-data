4 I go to this 99 Cents Only Store more often than the one near me in San Diego I think!  Every time I need anything they carry, I'm here buying it--things for my daughter, cleaning supplies, kitchen gadgets and supplies, condiments and baking mixes, snacks, you name it.    Yes, the lines can be long when they're busy but the clerks are always helpful and enough if them speak good English that I can usually get my questions answered, not always the case at my home store.    One advantage to shopping here is I'm already familiar with the layout because of shopping at the one at home.  Another is that I never have  to price compare or fish for coupons since everything is the same price.   I will keep coming here when I'm in town as long as they can keep my household and travel needs met.
4 I have come in here several times over the years now. I happened to be the hood, so I thought I would pop in. As always I found things I did not come in for, but then forgot the things that I did come in for. If I would stop rushing around I might stop to think. But, the smell at times in here is a bit much and there is always so much commotion. Never mind all that. They do carry a lot of really cool things and all for for a screaming price. So I am happy to come here and buy a little. Lots of parking in the lot, but always a lot of people trying to get you to give them something in the parking lot as well. Hey, if I had extra $$ to throw around I wouldn't be coming here.Sorry. But, back to the issuse at hand. Good stuff, cheap price, check it out!
