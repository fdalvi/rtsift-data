5 Great customer service a lot of products. Must go and see for yourself
5 Great place to get your E liquid, the Cigar Cherry is great. They have great service and looks clean!!!
5 Went in the other day to stock up on juice and my husband wanted to add some flair to his vape. We found everything we were looking for. He got a new tank and a skull tip and we picked up 4 bottles of juice for $20. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back. Especially since i need to upgrade my vape very soon. Can't wait to pick up some more cool stuff.
5 Great store, good products and awesome deals and prices!  Staff is very friendly and helpful! Will definitely be back!
5 This store is amazing. Well stocked, organized and the staff couldnt be more helpful! Great alternative to the disgusting habit of smoking :)
4 Very cool shop. They are just getting started but stay tuned. They're gonna be one of the best!
5 We love this store!  My husband & I decided to quit smoking and wanted to try vaping.  The staff is very knowledgeable on the products and were very helpful.  We built our own & so far, it's working great.  They allowed us to try any flavor we wanted to so we would go home with something we liked.  We will definitely be going back to this store!
5 My friend got me into "Vaping" lol. So I went to this location and was greeted/treated with a warm Welcome. I told them from the start what I wanted and they guided me with ease.   Special thanks to John for his assistance! Explained everything I needed to know about coils/battery/tips/Mods/flavors, everything lol   If you're new to Vaping and want to quit smoking or just want to know more, John will gladly help you.   I got the Mountain Dew and Watermelon flavor with .6 Nicotine. You can get any flavor with ZERO Nicotine if you desire ;)  One last tip, they open at 10am
1 I actually enjoyed this store at first.  Problem was when I asked for a discount for a new E-vic because that the MVP I purchased there had broken only after 3 weeks of use.  Understanding they couldn't / wouldn't refund me, a discount was doable.  Keeping mind I had already purchased a dozen bottles of juice and a number of tanks, they would only offer me 5% off something that was already overpriced in their store. They were charging $110-115 when I actually found at TruVape for $80.   In my book, this is bad business. I would've been happy to continue shopping there for all my vaping needs if they had better customer service.   Give a man a fish, he eats for a day... Teach a man to fish, he eats for a lifetime. They chose to eat for a day.
2 Not a bad place, looks decent. Not much selection of juices and $1 per foot of kanthol or silica/ekowool is ridiculous. Just convenient cuz it's next to my place. Last resort type thing
5 By far the best shop I've been to in Vegas.  I drive past a handful of vapor shops just to come to this one!   Great customer service best selection and the prices are lower then the places I used to go to. I highly recommend everyone to come to this store. I wish I could give 6 stars!!!!
5 I am very happy with the service I receive, they are a great bunch of peaple, always answering questions I have and have great deals..5
