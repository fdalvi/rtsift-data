5 Have been going to South Shore Barber Shop for many years.  Very friendly barbers and always a consistently good haircut at a reasonable price.    Took my 15 month old son there for his first haircut and they made him feel comfortable and worked with him.  They even gave him a certificate for his first haircut and put some of his hair in an envelope for a keepsake.  Definitely recommend.
2 Great service, but way too expensive for me.  I get a buzz cut.  No frills.  Just go over my head with a really short blade.  $16 is way to much for that and the most I have paid anywhere in the country.  It should be around $10 - $12 at most.  I will never go back.
5 Best $16 hair cut in town. Straight razor, too. These people know how to cut men's hair!
