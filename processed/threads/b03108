4 A Jamba Juice is a Jamba Juice is a Jamba Juice. If you have ever been to one before, you know what you are getting yourself into. Lots of fresh fruits and some baked goods. Jamba is one of my favorite places to grab a quick breakfast on the go. Try their oatmeal. It's great.  The special thing I have to add about this location is the great customer service. I really wanted to try the new Apples 'n Green, but I am allergic to mangoes. (Evil, evil mangoes) When the Jamba Juice guy saw my disappointed face, he told me it was no problem to hold the mangoes. Now that I know this, I can try all the smoothies I want! Thanks, Jamba Juice employees.
3 Staff is friendly, service is fast.  But damn, seven dollars for a drink? I could have got lunch instead.  I mean, I have the seven dollars, but I usually don't like pissing that kind of money out. A chunky BM is acceptable at that rate.
