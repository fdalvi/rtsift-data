3 Although they didn't have what I was looking for, the help was friendly and the store was very nicely kept. And they had a decent selection of course everything is a dollar. So I said " you guys are okay in my book (A-OK) one of the good ones" so I won't rule them out when I'm looking for dollar deals.
4 Great place to find some deals on party decorations and good deal on teaching supplies.  They also have a great deal on baloons!
4 I'm sold. This place has too many of the same cheap items I can find at the grocery store or discount stores like Target (namely party stuff and gift wrap and tissue paper and arts & crafts). Why go spend more than a dollar for the same stuff? I'm not.  Staff is friendly and place is clean and well organized. Plenty of parking space too.
