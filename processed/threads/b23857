5 My experience with laser hair removal previously to going to Pampered Laser Hair Removal was nil.  I found Deidra Johnson, the owner and operator, to be charming and engaging while the hair removal process was being performed.  She explained completely what expectations I should have, how many times I would need to return in order to experience the results I wanted and was completely honest with me regarding how the process worked and what I should expect.  I had gotten a number of estimates from other laser hair removal establishments and had found Deidra's to be considerably less....in some cases more then half of what others were charging.  The results I received after two treatments have been amazing and probably will not need to go back any time soon.  I dont think there is a better laser hair removal establishment in the valley that will give you more bang for your buck....
5 A truly amazing experience!  I have always thought about getting laser hair removal, but I had heard it was so expensive.  Deidra offered such a great price I couldn't turn down the chance to try it.  It was a little painful, and she explained that it would be a bit uncomfortable.  She was very kind and let me take the process as slow as I needed.  I will definately be going back to finish up the treatments, which for my neckline that I had done, she said it would only take 4-5 treatments.  I would recommend to anyone who has ever thought about having it done.  Thanks Deidra.
5 Before getting lasered I was really nervous about the whole process, but Deidra was really sweet and helped calm my nerves, there was a mild discomfort, but not as bad as I feared, and she allowed me to take breaks when I needed them. She did a great job and I'll totally be finishing my treatments with her.
