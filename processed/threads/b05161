5 I don't know why this was on yelp yet had no review This place is just off the beaten tourist path but is a supper cool local hang. First of all their is a bar area with lotsa of  tvs and lots of liquor so that you can check your bets and drink proportionatley according to your wins or loses. the bar and rest are modern and comfortable but still casual. i liked the fact that you could get a great steak a nicely done salad or a big fat hamburger . the fair is American and southwest and has a few Itallian items too!  Who new that there was a actually people oustide of the strip! prices are between 5- 20 bucks a deal,.
2 Now a Kopper Key chain bar & grill. Nice bar with typical food fare.
1 Used to frequent this place.  I charged our drinks and meal; then left cash for a tip.  My credit card was charged and additional amount.  This has happened to me twice now - not good practice.  I don't recommend.
