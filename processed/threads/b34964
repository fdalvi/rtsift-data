5 Very convenient , specially when you have to wait in line at the registration desk
1 Lobby bar bartenders are rude. Two bartenders ignored us for 5+ minutes. We tried to get they're attention and when they made eye contact with us, they made no sign that they had seen us. We finally just decided to leave. There is no excuse for rude service.
1 hit this bar twice.    The second time, the bartender didn't even put alcohol in our Long Island Ice Teas. What in the world is that?  Please fire all bartenders here! To make any mixed drink without alcohol is unacceptable. That is straight robbing people for their money.    Didn't finish our drinks, didn't leave a tip, didn't think twice.
3 Servers where great, promt with the drinks. bar tender Jovan was a dick to say the least. When asking if we could eat while we watching the game , Jovan notified us that "it was against the rules". Then said nothing as a couple eat in front of us? So as we clarified it we could eat he again said no.... Just saying.
5 The bartender, Manny made me his specialty martini's! The most awesome bartender I've ever met! If you are here at Aria, look for Manny and ask for his specialty martini's.  Cucumber martini, strawberry martini & blueberry martini.
4 our first stop after checking in. it's a hotel bar located closest to our elevators. the bartender was a cool dude. drinks are obviously expensive if you're not playing the machines. cool spot. nothing extraordinary. the 4th star is for them holding my winning ticket in the video poker machine that i forgot to cash out. not a bad way to start the weekend in vegas but with great karma. we came back during our stay just to patronize them.
