5 I've been to a couple of boot camps in town and this is by far my absolute favorite!!!  Brandon and Omar are awesome trainers.  I've made a lot of friends here and the group is always encouraging.  Their pricing plan is very reasonable compared to other camps and the first one is always free so you have an idea of what you are getting into.  I've been going for about a year now and no camp is ever the same and they are willing to modify to any fitness level or injury.  If I hadn't been Yelping since '08 and had a few reviews under my belt I would say I sound like spam but I swear I'm not.  In fact look hard -- but not too hard -- and you can spot me in one of the pics!
5 I love our trainer Omar and the entire CFF crew! I've been coming to Camp Fit Force for over a year now, the entire group is constantly motivating me to push myself every time. it's a great group of people, a great setting, and a fantastic way to get in shape.
5 I've been coming to Camp Fit Force for over 2 years now, and can't tell you what an impact Omar and the whole CFF family have had on my life.  Omar is an amazing trainer, always encouraging and motivating you to go further than you thought you could.  The best part is that the whole group is like that!  Imagine a place where people are intimidating and just walk away when they finish with their workout.  Well, this is the complete OPPOSITE of that!!!  Everyone is so friendly and welcoming, and no matter what fitness level you are, everyone is encouraging you, motivating you, and congratulating you on your accomplishments.  It's an awesome workout and a great vibe. I've made a lot of life-long friends here, and it's taught me to love working out.  How can you beat that?
5 Great experience! Omar and his staff are fantastic and are very positive and motivating. Workouts are well organized, methodical and will challenge the beginner to the fitness freak in you.
