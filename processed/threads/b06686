4 i had no idea this place existed until my sister and brother-in-law told me about it. it's hidden really well beneath the kennedy manor apartments, but is worth the effort to find it.   we came for cocktails before my boyfriend and i went out to dinner for his birthday, so maybe it was because it was early, but there wasn't anyone else in there. it feels like a speakeasy in there, like al capone could be having a drink by the windows. there are black and white photographs around the room, and the wood is dark.   obviously, service was great because we were one of maybe two parties there. the drinks were delicious. it feels like a little hideaway. this might be madison's best kept secret.
4 Grade: B  Very underrated place. Unique food. Excellent service. Somewhat pricey.
3 This place is really quite nice. The breadth of the menu might be a bit narrow, but the quality certainly made up for it. Also, I was very impressed with the wine list.  I wouldn't go so far as to say the food is "unique" (as Patrick T. stated), but it is good. Personally, I found the ingredients somewhat 'blah'. Don't get me wrong, my food was very good -- it's just not truly "unique" in my experience. My date on the other hand, wasn't so impressed. As it turns out the salmon wasn't anything special. For the record, I had the pork tenderloin, which was outstanding.  Ladies, a tip: if you invite a guy out to dinner chances are he assumes you intend to pay. Don't invite him here and then expect him to spring for the bill -- especially not at these prices. Talk about being blind-sided, yeesh.
5 I don't very often give 5 stars, but I liked this place and so did my wife. And if mama likes it - everybody likes it. Art deco back to the 30's in a landmark building basement. A bar that lined the wall could have come from a Mickey Spillane novel. The waiter was attentive, funny, professional and spot on with all his recommendations.  The couple behind us were fighting, to our amusement. They were a couple of high rolling snobs and the guy, good looking well dressed in his 50's was bending over backwards to get the worlds biggest ice princess to just give him a hug now and then. Hilarious. So wanted to tell him she wasn't worth it and that he could do better just about anywhere. I had the special red snapper with dill laced tartar sauce. A work of art. Waiter was uber professional, watered us regularly and has worked there for 6 years. the wife would have liked to see more choices on the menu, but I found it to be part of the over all charm. Just a few dishes done to perfection. And it helps to have dinner with a beautiful lady.
5 I have not had a steak that yummy in YEARS.  It was lightly seasoned and cooked to perfection.  My husband loved the chicken as well.  I can't wait to go back!
5 Went here Friday night for our Anniversary.  Man, was it good!  I had the romaine salad, and hubby had the pate for apps.  Both yummy!  For our entree, I had Filet, he had New York Strip.  We both loved our steaks.  No room for dessert! I would highly recommend this restaurant.
5 The definition of a hidden gem. I regularly walked by this place for years, completely unaware of its existence. Head downstairs from the nondescript, nearly unlabeled entrance at the end of Langdon Street, though, and you'll proceed past the building's residential exterior down into a simple dining room with a bit of an Upper East Side feel. Chances are it's almost empty, as if it were reserved for some unseen statesmen.  Kennedy Manor specializes in the highly traditional menu. Steak. Pan-seared fish. Caesar salad. Risottos. Cheese plates. You can criticize them for a lack of inventiveness, but you can't knock the quality of what they're doing here. The chefs have apparently chosen to focus on serving old-school five-star cuisine, perfectly executing the basics that are hammered in by any culinary school.   Started off with a chicken liver pâté, pre-prepped and preserved under clarified butter solids. I haven't had pâté enough times before to know if this is how it should be, but I found it delectable. Coming from someone who retches at the thought of visceral poultry innards like gizzards and giblets, I hope this counts for something. It was a little salty, a little sweet, hearty and meaty, thick and spreadable like butter, paired with a variety of whole grain crackers that made for a perfect apéritif.   Then came the steak, perfectly cooked to the medium rare consistency that I had specified. It was a little smoky and a lot juicy, and clearly a high-quality cut of beef. The mashed potatoes were good but nothing special, while the red wine glaze paired perfectly with the beef and with the excellent vegetables on the side. Despite being doused in this sauce, the veggies retained their crunch and carried their distinctive flavors that cannot be found in any water-loaded supermarket varieties.  Finished things off with a decadent chocolate cake. The chocolate sauce was of a superb sweetness and consistency, and the cake perfectly moist. No Hershey's HFCS taste here - just pure, unadulterated chocolately goodness.  Three basic courses. Hors d'oeuvres, protein, chocolate. In a city full of cutting-edge establishments trying to reinvent food, the classic American fine dining establishment has become somewhat of a rare breed. Kennedy Manor does it right.
2 Completely unmemorable and way overpriced.  Ordered the spaghetti bolognese, $18. Waitress returned to let me know it was out and suggested the spaghetti and meatball special, $14.95. What came out was a reasonable portion of overcooked dry pasta, four small meatballs and very little tomato sauce. Turns out they use the sauce and meatballs from frambonis. With no appetizers, salad or sides the pasta with two beers was $31. Very overpriced and completely blah. Won't return.
