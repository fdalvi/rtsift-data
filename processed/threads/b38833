4 We got a coupon in the mail offering $25 in free match play and 25% off the food bill not including alcohol so we thought we'd give it a shot.  I was unaware that "The Bar" was actually a chain in town so I read up on the one by Grand Canyon Drive.  This new location is the closest bar to my house so we had high hopes it would be decent enough to become semi-regulars.    I had never been to this bar when it was previously Bootleg Benny's but the place was completely redone according a patron I talked to and it definitely shows.  The setup is right up there with an above average video poker bar with a few more choices for food than just wings and burgers.    Happy hour consisted of $2 Bud Light, Michelob Ultra and well drinks.  I was hoping for some food deals but no dice.  Thanks to Rich W's review of The Bar on Grand Canyon, I got the prime rib sandwich which totally delivered.  Nice juicy slices of prime rib topped with deep fried jalapeno slices and horseradish but the real kicker was how good the bun was.  My wife got the turkey avocado wrap but for some reason they forgot to put in the avocado so they sliced up half of one and brought it on a plate afterwards.  That was tasty as well since the turkey was roasted and cubed instead of just being your run of the mill deli meat.  The machines were also kind enough to bestow a couple of quads to us which took care of our bill.  The TV's were pretty good so I will definitely be back to watch a few games.
5 We have been ordering from The Bar on Grand Canyon since they opened. I order a very specific burger cooked a specific way with a specifically cooked egg on top, (yes I know I'm picky,) :) and GC consistently screws it up...  This new location got it SPOT ON!  Literally perfect! Although it is an extra mile or so away, we will definitely be ordering from this location instead...  Thank you so much for making my taste buds dance!!  :)
1 Horribly overpriced. Live right behind this place and ordered 2 shots and 2 beers and had a $23 tab (before tip). I'd understand the price if I was buying drinks at The Palazzo on the strip, but for a "bar" way off the strip?? C'mon... Furthermore, it took over 7 mins to get our shots and the bar was NOT packed at all and the shots were the smallest shots we've ever been served. At $6.00 per shot, that was a RIPOFF. And they run NO happy hour past midnight. Won't be coming back. Save your money and avoid this place, completely ripoff.
4 So far so good.  Prices can be high for a bar. But it's up kept. It's also only 2 months old.   Bartender knows how to make a drink here as well!  Free potato chips are a tasty treat.    Food is a little slow on delivery.   However it's good!  Try the BBQ bacon burger with tater tots!  Over all we will return. Just prepare for slow service.
5 Get the shrimp tacos! Amazeballs. And ask for Chip or Nick!
5 Great food and awesome service.
5 There was a small problem with my burger but it was fixed quickly and the food was still really good. The service is great and they have good after dinner coffee. It's not super loud and the set up is good no matter where you sit, I will come back.
5 Mike was an amazing bartender and has an uncanny ability for figuring out what you like to drink.
4 Very friendly service and fantastic food! If you're looking for a good bar to hangout and watch sports and drink beer give these guys a try. There is a shuffleboard table against the back wall to play as well as a couple of dart boards. Just ask the bartender to play either game.
3 Well this was a pleasant surprise when it opened last year! This bar looks similar to the first 2 locations but is more spacious and full of energy. There are some of the most attentive bartenders here (even in the busiest rushes). You are well taken care of here. Oh, and expect the same high quality "TheBar" signature dishes here too
5 Great food....A must: onion rings ...Buffalo wings...tatchos...truffle mac & cheese. Not so much of a fan of their chicken tortilla soup.  Right price great food. Btw haven't dined in yet. This is all to go!!! Well worth every penny
5 Great local bar to go too! Always have a good time with awesome music and good priced drinks!
