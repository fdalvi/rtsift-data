4 Just had a mean latte from here real quick while eating my crepe from La Creperie (no seating)!  It's just a quick little express corner!    Thought it interesting that they carded me since they serve alcohol even if I just ordered a coffee, but the barista was a cool dude that kept good conversation.  The next morning was a little messy with two behind the counter and a big rush for this small station.  I understand as a past barista how hectic it can feel and get with such little wiggle space, so no biggie for me!
2 good for late night snack
1 Very slowwwww service! I ended uip leaving because the barista was so slow. I was the only person in line and waited 10 minutes before leaving because they wouldn't take my order.
2 AWFUL! For starters, the bread is horrible (and without enough butter), it took over 25 minutes for them to bring out a fish dish and a sandwich because "the fries were too greesy." -- WHAT?!?...
