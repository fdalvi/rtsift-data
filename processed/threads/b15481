4 I was the client from hell!!! Well not really but everyone that knows me knows exactly how particular I am about EVERYTHING! So needless to say after doing lots of research I decided to go with Aladdin Roofing. I drove my Sales Consultant ,Tom Quammen crazy. Lets just say that if he can put up with me then he can handle anyone. When we first met I had major, major doubts but he proved me wrong.   There were a few hiccups along the way and I have learned that with contractors, you have to expect some hiccups. One major thing was a scheduling snafu which had me very angry and I let it be known that you have got to keep the lines of communication open at all times, especially with a client like me. Believe me I think that entire company learned from that mistake, but I did not curse anyone out, however I did let them know that I was beyond disappointed.   Fast forward to Monday in which they had a crew of 8 men out to work on getting my roof replaced. Everyone was on time, very friendly and very thorough. They worked diligently for 11 hours and when it was all said and done my roof looks great. Tom was on-site for most of the day making sure that things were getting completed in a timely fashion and made sure that everything was to my liking. The crew cleaned up everything and Tom not only helped with the clean up, but came back the next day just to make sure nothing was missed since it was close to dark when the job was finished as well as to check to make sure that everything was as it was before I got my roof done.  So as of right now, I am very happy with my new roof. The true test will be during a really good rainstorm, but I do believe the job was done efficiently and effectively so I don't forsee any problems   If you are in need of a new roof, make sure to contact Aladdin Roofing and ask for Tom. He will make sure the job is done right and within your budget.
1 In general, the quality of the work wasn't very good. Aesthetically, it is less than pleasing. One of the screaming problems they had technically was that they used a car jack (the upright kind) to jack up the air conditioner on my roof rather than professionally removing and replacing it. Then when we had problems with the air conditioner leaking (both water and air) because it wasn't set right the owner said it wasn't his problem. After he was unconscionably rude to me on the phone, he reluctantly agreed to fix the setting of the air conditioner. His fix was some rubber bits and a nail. They also charged me $151.00 to comb out the fins on my air conditioner. Even though they never did that. I paid for that myself.  They also reused my old tiles that they had popped off my roof. The tiles that were broken when removed they replaced with some tiles that were taken from another job.  They left broken pipes in the roof and we had to tell them to replace them, because they weren't planning to. They were just going to leave them in and give us a check back for them when the job was done.  They backed into all of our awnings on one side of the house. They ruined a privet hedge that has been there since the 1940's. And they left garbage and nails everywhere.  The saga continues... At the beginning of this year, we found out (after paying two plumbing companies, replacing the toilet, cleaning up sewage, digging up the back yard) that Aladdin covered up the air flow pipe in our bathroom that caused us almost $1,000.00 in repairs, replacements and time. They fixed that and put in the pipe after a letter to the BBB and they said they would deduct all of those expenses from our final bill. They still have not. It has been months. If you can believe this, the last invoice I received was an inaccurate and nasty "You better take care of this or we will negatively effect your credit" invoice and they tacked on a late fee, just for good measure. Then, I get a ridiculous email from the head of accounting (the one with 20 years of experience who can't follow the terms of our contract) that says she is "done playing games" with me. Had I known this was a game, I would have played along sooner.         The most horrible part of all of this, we went with them because they were local. We are very big on supporting local companies. They are an Arizona company and we really love to support our community. We checked them out on the BBB website and they had an A+ rating. And we also checked the ROC website and they had had no complaints so we felt confident hiring this business. We liked our sales men, yes, there were more than one. The work itself isn't impressive but I am over that. It is the treatment we have suffered from the owner and the head of the billing office since that is really shameful and I wouldn't wish this nightmare on anyone. Oh and by the way, we're still finding nails...
5 I had a leak that over time ended up causing some major damage to my roof.  After calling around, I got the best quote from Aladdin Roofing.  I was concerned because the lowest price usually means less quality and inferior service.  Well, I sure was wrong!  I got not only great service, but when I had my father go up and inspect after they were done, he was very impressed by the workmanship.  I have nothing but good things to say about Aladdin Roofing and their staff.  I would recommend them to all my friends and family :)
