4 Who doesn't love a little Arbys. Their window is probably one of the slowest around... but who cares. Are you really needing your food in 3 seconds?  Nah...  PS - I dream about the loaded potato bites!
5 Fast drive through just before 5pm! Got everything hot or cold( shake) and with a smile!
4 I need to show this Arby's some Yelp love.  I've probably been there 2 dozen times in the past 3 years and the food is always fresh and fast, and the employees are always friendly.  I was a bit disappointed when they stopped serving breakfast because their bacon, egg, & cheese croissants are waaaaay better than those gut bomb croissanmiches that BK sells.  But, I don't need to eat that stuff very often anyway, so it's ok.  I've had the new smokehouse brisket sandwich twice now and it's really good.  I think they could put a few more of those fried onions on it because I think the two times I've had it there've been like two.  It's still a great sandwich.  The brisket is very tender and smoky and you can't beat smoked gouda.    For years I used to crave a Beef and Cheddar, but once I lived in St. Louis and had roast beast sandwiches at Lion's Choice I could never go back to Arby's for that.  I do enjoy the roast turkey and swiss sandwich at Arby's and have found that to be a good option when I'm traveling and my only choices are an Arby's, a Sonic, or a gas station.  That's really a tasty sandwich too.  I'm not big on fries or soda, but they usually have decent tea so I get by.
5 I have to comment on this Arby's. Every time I come here, I am struck by how spotlessly clean it is--from the front to the kitchen area. The food is also hot and fresh and the employees are friendly and good at their jobs. The manager here is obviously doing a great job!
