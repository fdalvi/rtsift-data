5 We've had two of our vehicles tinted by Rudy. And my folks have had several cars done - including antique vehicles. They all look great! He is meticulous about the job he does and his prices are so inexpensive too!   We can make faces at people passing us by and they can't see us. Only kidding! But seriously, if you need tinting, this is definately the guy to go to!
5 I thought my car looked good before I brought it in. Looks even better tinted out. Pro service along with some great laughs. I would recommend Cutting Edge to my friends, no doubt.  I read the other review and it sold me.  Thanks!
5 Rudy did the window tint on my Honda Ridgeline. I had difficulty deciding how dark I wanted to go with the tint. Rudy was patient as we discussed the options. Then he showed me several sample tints and how they would look.   The man puts a lot of effort in ensuring you get just what you want. His attention to detail is great and very reassuring. It has been three years and not one issue with the tint or its durability.   Did I mention his price was extremely reasonable? You have got to give him a call, you will be glad you did.
