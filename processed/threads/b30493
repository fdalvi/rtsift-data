5 I love listening to this station for Classic Rock during the day and Foxx and MacKenzie in the morning.  F&M are hilarious and always have interesting topics to discuss.  The playlist of Classic Rock during the day is sometimes predictable but the songs are always very good.    I love this station!
3 I love classic rock but I wish Foxx & Makenzie would play more from bands like Collective Soul.  Also, I'm sure Foxx is a fox but she sounds like she missed a lot of English classes in high school.  Someone needs to tell her that growing up pretty but dumb isn't really pretty.  It shouldn't be that tough to have fun on the air and still sound somewhat smart... The way Foxx talks on-air make me want to change the station...
4 The only thing that I have a problem with is, their website friggin sucks. I simply wanted to know the name of a song on Sunday afternoon, so I went to the website and no play list....nothing!!!! On 105.5's website, you go to the site and immediately you can go to play list, it will have in order, the songs on youtube so that you can listen to the songs. Take a note 97.1
