5 I was afraid that the food here would taste a little too healthy, but I was so wrong. It is decadence without the guilt! There is so much variety to the menu too. I recommend trying the oatmeal cold in yogurt or warm with Coconut oil.  The coconut oil will literally make you feel weak in the knees, it is that good. The decor is like a micro brewery/shabby chic country store. Which doesn't sound like it goes together, but it does and it looks great. It's a really relaxed atmosphere and is the perfect place to meet friends for brunch! If the food wasn't already good enough you should go to this place just to see the Robert Downy Jr. look alike that works behind the counter! Seriously though, Sam and Melissa were great hosts every time I've been there. Very friendly and knowledgeable.  Melissa seems like the kind of gal that would go out of her way to help a perfect stranger,  and it really shows in the way she runs this family business. You won't regret trying this really original take on how to eat oatmeal.
5 As if Iss' magic mixes wasn't good enough now we have a cafe too? So if for some reason you're too lazy to make your own oatmeal creations now you can have them made for you! Can't go wrong here. Something for everyone. Seriously!
5 This is a GREAT hidden gem! - And proof that healthy, clean food doesn't have to taste boring. A group of us popped in this morning to grab a late breakfast, all trying different combo's, and everything was to die for. The owner walked us through all the different ways to try the variety of oatmeal and pancakes offered.  The prices are definitely on point, they don't over-charge for anything on their menu. We all will be back!
