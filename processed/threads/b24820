1 I took my son here and we waited for over an hour and people were coming in after us and getting in before us. They kept telling us we will get in soon but we finally left after an hour of waiting
5 Great Salon with great stylists and prices are also good.

1 I went in for a simple long layer for me and trim and bangs for my 5 year old daughter. My layers came out horrible. The stylist washed my hair, cut it, then let me walk out of there with a soaked head. Seriously?? I've NEVER had to ask for my hair to be blow dried. I didn't need it styled or anything, but dry would have been nice. The other lady who did my daughters bangs....how do you mess up bangs so badly if you're a professional? She looked like Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber only his were straighter. The prices are cheap and let me tell ya, you definitely get what you pay for!! Never going back, ever.
