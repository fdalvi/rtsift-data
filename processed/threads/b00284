4 The various red sauce pasta lunches are a great deal, and some people are big on their porketta sandwiches (not me, really).  I always liked their pre-packaged desserts and other gournet goodies, and LOVED their muffaletta sandwiches (ask for one, they dropped them from the menu a while back, but the last time I went they would still make one for you).
5 The first thing I think about when I think about Fraboni's is the smell when you first open up the door.  It is totally delicious, and you really can't put your finger on exactly what it is.  I assume it's a combination of the cooking porkettas and meatballs, the various spices they sell, and pizza sauce.  Whatever the smell is, I wish I could order a plateful of it!    If I am going into Fraboni's, you know I'm not coming out empty handed.
5 Franoni's is 100% reliable - always delicious. Subs are awesome and great for taiilgating. There are also great frozen dinners for home and great food ideas for parties. The Italian grocery store is the best in Madison. I've been partaking in Fraboni's deliciousness for more than 20 years!
4 Subs and deli items are great. Lots of different salads and daily specials. Porketta sandwich, yum. The Otto Sub is a delicious meat coma of a sub as well.
5 FRABONI"S mmm.. walk in... now breath it in....Just stepping though that door you know you are in the real deal. THIS is my personal must have GO TO place when creating my perfect italian sauce.If they did not exist, i would be floundering for an alternative. FRABONI's offers San Marzano canned tomatoes, which are hard to find, Real Italian olive oils and global spices ( I love the choices of oreganos) etc. Fraboni's is the only place in Madison to get real Ricotta Cheese available in 3 pd containers, and I mean good Ricotta, not the mushy watery stuff.  They also carry imported FETA. If you are a FETA fan, please i beg you to try the French Feta. It is beyond creamy goodness. I have to say, you can also get your Pecorino Romano here as well as your PARMIGIANO-REGGIANO  Oh did I mention the full Italian Deli?? Prosciutto, mortadella, imported provolone and pancetta..i can go on and on( i use their homemade Italian sausage in my sauce) Fraboni's is a TRUE Italian Specialty Store.  I have not indulged in their ready foods, but based on the store itself, i wouldn't be surprised by excellence. Please go in...be amazed by Italy in Madison. Don't cook without them!
5 The first thing about Fraboni's is what everyone else has said: that second you open the door and breathe in the various food smells. Hey, it's the little things in life! If I want to cook Italian, I HAVE to go to Fraboni's to pick up the ingredients. I usually drop in for their deli and ready-made sandwiches. I think they wave a wand over the sandwiches before setting them out because anywhere else it would be just a sandwich. Theirs are the most fantastic deli sandwiches I've had in Madison.  Anyway, if you haven't gone, go.
5 MEATBALLS! Bring your radio flyer into the store to load up on all the delicous treats to bring home.   Olives, Feta, BALLS, sausages, cured meats, pickled veggies, baguettes, hoagie sandwiches, do you want me to go on?  Lasagna, tortelinni, cheeses soft and hard, crackers from Italy, sauces for your refrigerator, frozen meals for the freezer. If you can't find a meal here to please everyone, good luck to you.  Friends coming over in an hour?  Pick up some antipasta here, bottle of wine, or two and a loaf of fresh bread. Boom.  Done. Balls.
