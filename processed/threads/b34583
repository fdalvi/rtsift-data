3 Typical Starbucks located in ASU Tempe campus's Memorial Union. They do not serve the toasted breakfast sandwiches and don't accept certain Starbucks incentives/coupons. Hours may vary with semester breaks and MU building closures.
1 A typical Starbucks but STAY AWAY from all Starbucks on campus. For some reason they have the WORST service..
5 The blonde guy who works there is SO cute. Happy baristas and quick service (which is surprising considering it is one of the busiest in the nation)!
