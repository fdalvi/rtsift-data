2 Yeah, I eat at McDonald's. What of it? I am hooked on breakfast sandwiches, okay?  Leave me alone. I don't care if it's a $20 breakfast sandwich from room service or a $3 sandwich from McDonald's. Addicted.  This particular McDonald's is in a gas station, which is pretty dope. And this is a good stop if you're headed to Lee Canyon for skiing.  Fish tank!  There is one at this McDonald's. Say again, fish tank!
4 Been to this Mcdees many times. The food has always been fresh, hot, the service prompt and friendly. Clean restaurant and restrooms.
2 What a crappy slow drive thru in the mornings! Because there's 2 order screens, your order can easily get mixed up if stupid drivers cut in front of you.  Bad call McDonald's.    Food was slapped on.  But hey, that's why it's fast food.
4 Something is fishy about this McDonalds. That is all the fishes swimming in the awesome aquarium in the heart of the dining area. This is no ordinary aquarium. It is an aquatic garden. McDonalds made what would've been an ordinary McDonalds attached to a Chevron into a fun restaurant to dine in. Children seemed amazed by the fish. There are seats arranged around the aquarium, that offer closeup views. For guests who are drinking a beverage, there are more comfortable lounge seats that overlook the aquarium.    I was happy with the service, food, and overall experience.   BTW, I uploaded two pictures of the aquarium this businesses Yelp page.
2 The food is usually fresh. The only problem is they have some SALTY ass fries. It never fails, no matter what time or day I go they are always super salty. Hate it.
