5 We have been going here for the past 10 years. They are always friendly and it's always a pleasant experience when we have to bring our vehicles in! Definitely recommend them to anyone who's looking for great service at a reasonable price.
5 The guys at Junction Tire have always been honest with us, and the service is quick and well done. Great full service shop, comfortable waiting room, friendly staff.
4 Friendly service, reasonable pricing, and pretty accommodating with scheduling. My family has always taken their cars here, and they know my dad by name.  Now I'm taking mine and no complaints!
5 Had some work done on my car and am very happy with the service at this shop. There are a lot of shops to choose from out there and this one is now at the top of my list for my regular services. It nice to be able to take your car to a business and have the correct work done on it and not feel like your being hounded to have a lot more unnecessary work done. Each employee was very nice, specific, helpful and knowledgeable. Going to a shop where you feel comfortable and are not breaking the bank is a win win! A few other perks is their nice little waiting area, it has a TV, free coffee, water and wifi while you wait. Definitely recommending this shop to everyone!
5 Hands down best place! Family owned and you always feel like family. Best customer service there is! I have been going here for 7 years. I refer everyone here!
