4 The Dagwood club: salami, ham, turkey, cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayo...I got pepperjack cheese  Bread-soft,fresh  Meats-good quality Veggies-well they are veggies  Overall a good solid samich, I hear the Archie deluxe is the thing here, ham cream cheese? Avocado n bacon bits? On a kaiser roll, hmmmmmmmm Maybe if I'm feeling really adventurous next time!
5 This place is great! Super friendly customer service. Good bread, yummy meats and cheeses... tastes good without being soaked in oils and mayo like certain chain sandwich spots. We're locals and will be back for sure. Thanks!
5 My husband and I have been going to Dagwood's um excuse me TJ's for about 15 years now since we were dating. BEST LUNCH DATE EVER! I can never get enough Mr. Dither's and Archie's. OOOOoo and Blondie's I could go on and on. I could eat here everyday if I had the money. They have a great menu and a wonderful friendly staff. I dare you to say that any of their items are bad. I have never had a bad experience with service or food. We have catered a big family picnic with their sandwich trays. Everyone kept saying how delicious the sandwiches were, so we will have to do that again for sure! LOVE LOVE LOVE DAGWOODS um I mean  LOVE LOVE LOVE TJ'S!!!! PLEASE NEVER CLOSE BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE I CAN GET MY Mr. Dither's FIX!
