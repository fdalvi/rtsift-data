5 The cuts of meat here are so much better than any supermarket in the area. Also, to add to your list of reasons to visit this wonderful store is the fact that their prices are great! Just $1.99/lb for the best brisket I have ever had the pleasure of smoking. Port butt is great and they make their own sausage and brats on site. GO HERE ASAP!!!!!
5 Just wanted to update- I had said it was slightly pricey. I must have been smoking crack that day because I went there again today after going to Fry's and Safeway. Not only is the meat here FAR better than a supermarket's meat, but the prices are actually BETTER as well. Also, they make their own sausage and brats here. GO HERE NOW!!!
5 This place is a real Scottsdale secret! They are not fancy.  Just a place that I think distributes to mostly high end restaurants, but will sell to the public also.  Great prices and awesome access to source to high quality meat.  I bunch of unmarked trucks out front and you walk into a basically a meat cutting center with a counter.  The guy who waited on me was very nice, knowledgeable and wanted to help me out even though I was not his biggest customer.  I wanted half a tenderloin and he said if I could come back the next day he would save me the center from the cuttings.  It was over 3 lbs of the best part for about $40!   I will make 6 nice fillet mignon out of it....  I can't wait to go back and try some other cuts and see what else he can hook me up with.
5 Love this place! Good quality meats and Gnarly Service. Thanks!
5 This place is GREAT!!! I have been a customer of Frenchs since the early 90s when they had a Mesa location. Great people, great food. If you are looking for a designer butcher shoppe, this is not it. If you want great meat at a great price...go here NOW!!!
