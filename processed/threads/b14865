1 Wow this place is like a bad unorganized garage sale. Owners are rude, cash only. They have some electronics in box, broken, missing pieces. They have a dollar section items that may or may not be new. They have nice furniture way over priced.  This store would have potential if they took the time to organize and price items with stickers instead of markers. The store would be horders dream...
5 If you want a deal for your buck, this is the place to go! You'll find Dewalt, Makita, Oster, Cuisinart, Farberware, Keurig, and many other banded items for a fraction of the original retail price. Yes, some items will be out the package, missing a manual, or may have a scratch or a dent but I rather pay a fraction of the price versus paying full retail at a department store. I rather save money and get a ridiculous deal for the same exact item I would have paid 10X more at a well organized and clean shop. From what I know this store has been open for nearly ten years; the owners are one of the nicest people I've met; they even offer free delivery with the furniture or any other large item you purchase. Stop by!! You'll get a kick from just walking down the unorganized, messy aisles; but once you get to the register to pay- you'll be happy!! "Get more for less!"
5 First of all this place is where you are going to get the best deal on furniture, NOBODY can beat their prices on furniture, It is NOT overpriced at all. The owners are only rude to people that try to bargain when the owners are already not making much of a profit from what they are selling, to help stupid customers afford things, where they cant elsewhere. All in all, this is a liquidation center, they dolet you know if pieces are missing or if something is broken. Love this place!!!! Best deals anywhere....Thanks Mega...from the people out there that are not rich and need help in this economy buying things for the home, makeup, furniture, tv's, mattresses, etc.. Keep up the good work!!!
1 It really is like a bad garage sale. Things will be balled up and mummified with scotch tape and won't have a price on it. I don't understand how they can have merchandise out there with no price. I'm pretty sure its illegal or at least against policy for AZ weights & measures. I also find stuff with stains on it. Big poop stains. Wth? They display items that have toxins in them (such as hair dye) above edible things or things to be eaten out of (such as utensils) Again, I'm certain that's against regulations. Be careful what you buy, too, as there are no exchanges or refunds.
