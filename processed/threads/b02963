3 Typical sports bar atmosphere with a lively crowd. Good things: they have live entertainment on Tuesdays and Saturdays, Karoake, Texas hold 'em, and other fun events. They also offer pool, shuffleboard, darts, video games, and of course, many televisions for all your sports veiwing needs. Bad things: the crowd was a little too loud/rough for me, but hey, it's a sports bar.
2 This place was between decent enough and ehh... I'm totally up for a good dive bar experience once in a while, but dive bars are supposed to be cheap and this place is not. I went last night for a going away party and ordered a beer, a double shot of jager (for the guy going away :) and a diet coke- $18. It was clean enough, there was good music, LOTS of games on, even the guys at the open mic weren't bad, but I thought these places are supposed to be about drinking cheap. Oh well, if you go stick to bud light in a bottle :(
