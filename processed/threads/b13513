4 My old 320ml decided to cause me problems - it was stuck in low range and wouldn't shift out.  I took it to Sun Devil Auto who have done most of the recent maintenance on the suv (very competently I might add) and advertise that they do transmission work.  To their credit, they were unfamiliar about working on an old Mercedes and recommended going to a Mercedes speciality shop.  I've gone through a few Mercedes shops and have had little issues with each, so I decided to try European Auto Salon on 7th St.  Glad I did.  They were able to get me in the next morning.  They tried to find a simple solution, but of course few Mercedes' issues are ever simple.  But after dropping me off at work, they called an hour later with the diagnosis and estimate that proved to be right on.  After lunch, the car was ready and I drove away - a little poorer, but happy to have found a new shop I trust.
5 Nobody EVER wants to have to go to a shop, but had an incredible experience here.  Mike and sister and crew are true professionals who are experts in their field and deliver outstanding customer service.  You have plenty of options on 7th St but the local Mercedes dealership is closed and they're a GREAT place.  Got me right in, told me what the problem was, gave me an expert diagnosis and fixed it within a couple hours at a very reasonable rate.  Been to a lot of shops and this was seriously the best ever.  Professional, honest, highly knowledgeable know what they can and can't do and do what they do well.  Highly recommend!
5 Excellent auto repair!    I've been to many mechanics, including the dealership, for service but European Auto Salon stands out from the rest in regards to their competency, honesty, and knowledge. My husband and I both bring our vehicles here for everything from regular maintenance to periodical repairs, and are always thoroughly impressed by the service.   Highly recommended.
