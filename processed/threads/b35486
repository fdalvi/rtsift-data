5 Its a Carl's Jr, its close to my house, it has great food and service, I think I'm in love!
5 Has to be the best fast food I have had!. Chicken is hand breaded to order and the fries are sooo fresh. Can definitely say that I wont be eating fast food anywhere else for a long time. Damn good deal!!!!!!
5 I don't eat at fast foods.  However, I love their Sweet Potato Fries.   My family likes the Steak sandwich.  Very good service and clean on the inside.
2 The food was awful!  The barbecue sauce tasted like vomit and the fruit punch was extremely watered down.  The fruit punch tasted like water with some red food coloring in it.  It was the worst fruit punch I have ever had!!  The buns were not fresh and tasted like they were very old possibly moldy but I didn't find any mold on them thankfully.  It has been a really long time since I have been to Carl's JR and I now remember why it has been so long since I have been there!  It is because it is really gross!  I would recommend Burger King over Carl's JR and no I would not recommend this place to anyone.
1 This place is the worst in fast food service.  The management does not seem to get the concept of good food fast with good service and attitudes from your employees who deal with the public.  And when you screw up an order, don't make pathetic excuses; apologize and fix the problem! Quickly!  I've been to this place three times now and each time have had to wait so long compared to other similar fast food places.   Great coupons in the mail. Great pictures of the food on the mailers. But they just don't deliver.  In the future, I'm taking my fast-food business elsewhere.
