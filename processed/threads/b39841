5 Matinata just completed a total renovation of our front yard and we couldn't be happier with the result!  Raul is extremely likable, professional, and easy to work with.  He listened to what we wanted and designed a new plan for our yard, remaining open to our changes or suggestions.   The crew removed all existing vegetation (except for the trees) and rock, replaced the irrigation, installed steps and new vegetation and rock.  We are thrilled with the outcome!  I know that if any issues were to come up, Raul would be here immediately to address them.  I  can wholeheartedly recommend Raul and his crew at Matinata.
5 Raoul is a talented and experienced landscaper who is very easy to work with. His team is very professional.  He completely renovated our back yard: removed unwanted plants and shrubs, prepared the rocky ground and planted several large trees and multiple shrubs, advised us about which plants to use and planted a vegetable garden and orchard.  He has an artist's eye as to how to place rocks and plants for the most pleasing effect.  He totally upgraded the entire irrigation system taking us from 2 zones to 6 zones so the different types of plants would receive the correct amount of water.
1 No call or show for estimate. Seemed bothered when I called him to schedule the estimate to begin with.
