4 It was black Friday, super busy and this one guy.. his name was KJ I think, blonde hair tall guy was so helpful ! I was there at midnight and came back in the afternoon after work and he helped me both times. He let me know about online deals and was there to help me find my size despite all the chaos. Definitely my favorite also branch . && sales here are good too . My favorite purchase was my originally $70.00 shoes that went down to $16 after tax
4 I always have the urge to stop by this store for some reason.. a few things caught my eye while stopping in.. extra 25% off clearance shoes. They had a lot of cute ones, unfortunately none in my size. I wasn't really impressed with the selection of purses.. probably just not my style. Other than that their shoes are priced decently. A lot cheaper than Steve Madden, but you get what you pay for.
