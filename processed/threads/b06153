5 Great for kids that like to perform in shows and competitions and they get to travel to San Diego too! Donna Frias is the owner that used to perform in Las Vegas review shows around the world. Her team of professionals will make sure your kids get what they need to reach their peak level of dance ability.
5 My son really enjoys the instructors at this dance center and it's in a very convenient location near our new home in Summerlin. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to get their kids into dance or tap.
5 This dance studio is great! Very friendly atmosphere, I always feel welcome. Every time I'm in there, it's buzzing. The kids look like their having fun and the teens and adults are serious about working. It's great to be part of this family
5 If you are looking for professional teachers to challenge you, but still have a family atmosphere The Pointe Dance Center is the place! Donna Frias is the owner and has been a complete joy to me and my family for years. She has a lot of experience in the entertainment world and it shows in her studio. They also have competing teams which is a great experience for  kids and teens. PDC competes from California to New York City. They truly make you feel like family after one class!  Feel the beat and head to PDC!
