5 I have only encountered one QuikTrip I wasn't happy with, and it wasn't this one. It's on my way to work, so I will occasionally stop in for gas (if it's cheap), a coffee, or some other drink. Mornings are quite busy, but their system gets the customer out pretty quickly...hence the name QuickTrip? Heh.
4 QT is my go to gas station! They usually have the cheapest gas prices around me and great customer service!  They also always have very clean/organized facilities and great selections on food and to-go products you may need on a road trip.  The only thing that could make QT better is if they could somehow get on the red box band-wagon if they did I don't think I would get gas anywhere else!
5 Great price. Always have dr pepper well stocked very clean store if you go after 3 you can get any doughnuts for 50 cents and there still fresh
5 I will go far out of my way to go to a quik trip. I actually once almost ran out of gas, but passed several other stations to get to one. They are always clean, stocked, and fast. The gas pumps are always operational (so many other gas stations give me trouble). The people are friendly and efficient.
3 Mini-Marts are all basically the same, some might have more inventory, some might be more cleaner, and some might be in a better location? Just by chance I was in the area. Just needed to use their restroom, now their restroom can use some TLC. Some of our valley artist thought it was OK to put some of their crap on the walls. However the rest of the store was pretty impressive. They had everything, especially at their self service area. From soda, slurpees, slushes, ice coffee, to hot food. A lot to choose from! Very impressive place.
