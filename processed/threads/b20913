4 It's admirable to see a record shop avoid the mainstream. Underground  Solu'shn prides itself on offering those hidden rarities, hard to find gems and an impressive selection of vinyl.  Ultimately this comes at a price with the average vinyl/ CD costing 12-14 pounds.  Nonetheless, unlike the larger entertainment mega-stores, you can try out your chosen record on any of the available decks: a sort of 'try before you buy' system. If your a budding DJ and your looking to boost your track collection with some rare gems, chances are Solu'shn will stock such items.
3 Underground solution is the sort of independent shop that has survived because it is specialised. HMV or the digital music scene is going to have a hard time controlling the rare vinyl market.  Underground Solution is a specialist music store selling, yup, vinyls, as well as a big stock of CDs and some audio equipment. It is genre specific, focusing on dance and electronic music (including drum n bass, House, Techno etc.). As a result this store is visited by DJs and those who really know what they're talking about.  Having said that, not being one of the above, I still enjoy browsing their vinyls, and more so, their CDs and I've still come away with a few good finds. Expect to pay for this shops expertise however, as prices are not cheap and the average vinyl is going to cost you Â£10 plus.  Note, Underground Solution Records is due to have a new online store soon.
