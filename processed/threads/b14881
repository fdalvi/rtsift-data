1 It's unfortunate that I have to write a bad review- but I believe it's important to get this out there. This is especially for those that are non-locals.   Thursday night, my friend and I needed a ride back to our hotel. It was already late and we could not take the light rail back because it had already made its last round.  Strike 1: Driver did not know where he was going & he was on his cell phone asking for directions. Strike 2: I knew that he knew a more direct way to get to our hotel; instead he chose to take a scenic route through a residential area. Therefore, making the drive longer than it should have been.  Strike 3: THE METER WAS NOT RUNNING. So he basically just said a random price when we got to our hotel.  We were picked up in the US AIRWAYS CENTER and our hotel was on Central & Osborn. We paid $12 for the fare; I guess I should assume that is a decent price. However, the service was unacceptable from my perspective. The meter should have been on.  PS. they also DBA as Elite Taxi Cab.
1 If you have to be some place on time, don't use them.  I called at 2pm for a 4:15 taxi to arrive.  At 4:25 they were calling me saying he was right around the corner, and gave me his location.  Estrella called a couple more times to "verify my address".  At 4:35 I called them and cancelled the cab and got a ride from my neighbor.  As we pulled out of my neighborhood, we PASSED the cab. He had taken a street that he thought was going to be a through street and got himself lost. This is a TAXI service, they should know how to get around the valley!!  Don't these people use GPS, or MAPS at least?!?!?!?  End of story, I was still late for my class that I paid 250.00 bucks for. I was not allowed in, and the money is non refundable.  So thanks Estrella wasting my time and costing me money.  WORST TAXI SERVICE EVER.
1 My wife needed to go see the doctor.  We called them the day before to set up the appointment.  They no showed.   When we called them they said it was an input error.  My wife missed her appointment.
