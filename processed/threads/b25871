1 The worst experience dealing with a bank ever!! Terrible customer service all the way around! The employees lack courtesy, are inexperienced and lazy (including management)! Do not bank here because you will regret it!!
5 I don't know what Mike S. is talking about. I have been banking with Mountain America for 5 years now. The Mesa Branch and it's employees are AMAZING! They go above and beyond to serve especially Connie the branch manager! I use them for everything from car loans to home loans to general banking.   Having worked in Customer Service most of my life I know what good service is and I also know there are always customers like Mike S. that will find fault in everything.
5 Since moving here frm Cali I still have a credit union, and this one of the locations I can take money out for free! There's a drive up ATM and when I need services inside the staff is always friendly and smiling. Will come here instead of the desert school across the street, they always give me a hard time.
