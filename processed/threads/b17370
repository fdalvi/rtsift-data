4 I really enjoyed Toni Braxton at the Flamingo. I was invited by some friends and we shared a bottle of Kettle One Vodka and mixers for a pretty decent price. Our table was nice and  the theater was kinda small so everyone had a good view.   But now, on with the show. I have always loved Toni and i realized how much I miss her music when I went to the show. I haven't added it to my ipod so it's been a while.   She kept the show short and sweet thats true, but it was intimate with a little comedic flare and some rockin dancers. At one point she showed clips from her old auditon tape for Babyface which was cool because you got to see the transformation from then to now.  Toni told jokes and even attempted to dance with the dancers which was cute because she admitted not being a dancer and asked us to forgive her. So beautiful, so modest :)  She interacted with the audience asking them questions and sat on many lucky fellas laps while a professional photographer took pics to sell after the show.   She brought her kids up on stage at one point which was really sweet and her sister was her back up singer so it was a true family affair.   I heard Toni was leaving in August. Everything in the store was 50% off so i think the rumor is true. If you like Toni Braxton I think its worth the buck. But like Shauna, I didn't pay for the tickets either so....... So I can't complain! Overall a great show and Yes, She is 40 and Fabulous! She looked great in all her costumes. Very Las Vegas.
