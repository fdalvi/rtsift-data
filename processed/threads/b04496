1 This is really for GNC.com; but deals with the overall company  GNC.com lists items that are known to be on backorder and accepts your card and places a order.  They then immediately cancel all the freebie items you qualified for and place an auth on your card.  I placed my order through them and after 2 weeks of waiting called in to cancel my order.  Customer Service then told me that they can not do that since it passed the cancel period.  I think's not.  I'm never giving a penny to them again, store or web-site.  Shop at SupplimentWarehouse.com for a better deal and better customer service.
5 This is a small location but still packed with everything I need.  They did start stalking more womens vitamins I liked without iron because they were always out when I went in.  So I thank them for that!  Staff are always nice and for the most part an answer all of my questions.  They take an added effort to get to know their customers.  They always ask about my son when I go in and this keeps me coming back because I feel valued as a person not just a customer.
