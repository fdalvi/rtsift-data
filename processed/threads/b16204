3 Cons:    Long wait time outside to pass through security. Being Las Vegas, waiting outside in the summer is not an enjoyable experience.   Parking at the on-site parking lot is $$$. Even for downtown parking.   Once inside no cell phone use. If you don't have reading material, it is boring.  Positives:     On my two visits here, the IRS agents have been friendly and helpful.     Modern building. Although waiting is boring, the interior is not dismal.  So the depressing factor is nonexistent.  Recommendations:     Park at a downtown casino, and walk vigitantly alongside the north sidewalk  along Ogden Street that passes under the railroad tunnel. With the money you save on parking, you can treat yourself to a good meal afterwards. I recommend the Main Street Buffet.      Try to get there by opening time, to avoid a long line outside.    Bring a good book or magazine. Cell phone use is prohibited.    Be careful filing your taxes, so that you do not end up here.
4 Very pleasant, moved quick, only waited 1hr when lobby was full. Parking sucks though.
1 Very unfriendly staff at the front, very un-knowledgable about everything!! Don't let these  people ruin your day, It's bad in here disputing some Bs charge !!!!
3 Ohh boy... Ok well first of all I suggest getting here early and treat it like the DMV. They open at 8:30am M - F and according to the employee I talked to inside they always have a line. If you don't get here first thing in the morning and need to meet with one of their tax people plan on being here for at least a couple hours.   Also, Parking is $3 per 1/2 hour! There is no other close resource for a parking spot, but I bit the bullet anyway and used a meter downtown just a block off Freemont street. You'll need $2 in change for 2 hours and that was the max the meter I used would go to. But it beat the almost $20 parking in the building would cost me. So long as I make it back to my car within 2 hours and don't get a parking ticket. It was still a couple block walk back to the building but I needed the exercise anyway.   When you get here get inline to get a ticket. They give out tickets with numbers corresponding to your problem, then take a seat and wait. Also although they do not close until 4:30 pm, they are known to stop giving out tickets as early as 1:30 pm, which means you will have to come back another day.   So to sum up, Get here early like 8 am, park a few blocks away and save some money on your parking and don't fall behind on your Taxes!!!
