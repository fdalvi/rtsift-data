4 This place tends to be a more busy location, but it gets four stars for 24 hours.  That's right, when you need a car battery at 11PM before work the next day, this is the place to go.
4 Went in to Batteries Plus to get my Optima battery checked on my (new to me) auto.  Tech told me the battery was bad.  Tech no longer recommends Optima but that the house brand is better.  I passed and went over to Auto Zone across the street.   Auto Zone tech told me that the battery was good, was less than 2 years old and only needed a recharge.  They also offered to check my alternator and charge the battery.  All for no fee.  In conclusion...Batteries Plus will rip off your grandma.  Auto Zone gives good service.
3 Don't come here looking for knowledge.  I find it to be spotty at best. And I'd prefer not to buy Duralast parts - but sometimes they have the only one of something I need and I go.  It's not bad for little pine trees and floor mats but don't expect to discuss the merits of ceramic vs metallic brakes with anybody in there.  they don't have a clue.
3 Alright for an auto parts store. They don't carry anything on hand for hybrids so pretty much everything for my car has to be ordered. Luckily, things are delivered the next day. The staff is helpful, the store is ok . . . not run down or anything but the manuals they have on the floor are missing pages.
5 The staff here was very friendly and helped me check my battery and alternator, all for no charge. They explained everything to me and were very helpful.
