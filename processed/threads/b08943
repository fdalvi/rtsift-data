1 I loathe this bank. I have had my biz account with them for over 5 years and they never cease to amaze me with the bad policies. They will hold a check that is over a certain amount so you don't have access to the money for over a week - sometimes two.  Whenever I have an overdraft they charge double - the NSF and then an overdraft charge - daily. So if you don't keep an eye on your account every day, you could end up with over $250 in fees from their charges and the payee of the check's fees. (this happened to me because somebody accidentally paid one of my developers from the wrong bank account) AND - when you go to pay off the overdraft fee, they hold the check you are paying it with for 2 days, so you get charged 2 more days of overdrafts, not to mention you don't have access to the funds you're deposting for 2 days.  If you deposit an international check, they send it directly to collections and it is on hold for 4-6 weeks. You don't even see the money in your account.  Anyways, there is much more they have done to me...but you get the point. Avoid Compass Bank unless you like bank reps that all just shrug and say they can't do anything for you.
3 I come in here every so often to make deposits for family member.  The folks there have been very friendly and I have not had any problems.  So, all is good so far...
5 I have been with this location when it was Founder's bank.  I've seen the change overs.  All told, it's been 17 years that I've been going into this branch.  Not once have any of these employees been anything less than friendly, courteous and professional.  I'm not a business owner, nor do I have tons of money in my accounts.  They've never treated me poorly.  I can't speak for the gentleman's poor review.  Perhaps he has valid complaints, but I do not.    Judge for yourself, I say.
