5 This tour will take you off-road through the desert, canyons, streams, and the mountains.  The guide (amazing guide, BTW) is excellent at reading the abilities of his tour group; expect to stretch your ATV skills as he pushes you and your machine to the limit in an exciting, safe way.  This tour is a must if you are even in Wickenburg, AZ.
5 This is the second time I've used Adventures of a Lifetime ATV, and there is a reason I came back. This is by far the best experience you could hope for when looking to ride. The tours you go on are more like riding with your buddies, rather than being taken in a group by a company looking to make as much money as possible. Customer service with AofL-ATV is the best I've received using any service any where. Steve and his crew know how to have a good time and he does his absolute best to make your trip as fun as possible. Well worth the money. I will be going back for a third trip soon. If you use any other ATV service, from Wickenburg to Phoenix to Tucson, you will be doing yourself a disservice. Pick Adventures of a Lifetime.
5 What a great day!  Steve hosted an amazing experience for a 5 hour tour of the Yavapai hills and can't wait to go back.  Reasons for a great trip: 1)  excellent ATVs.  These were 660cc and a little bigger than I was used to.  Felt safe and confident in the equipment. 2)  Amazing scenery.  Steve and crew took us to so many varied places with fast open stretches to slow crawling in 4-low. 3)  Great customer service:  Steve and crew were friendly, knowledgeable, and respectful of the desert, the people, and this made for a great experience.  Looking forward to our next trip with Steve!
5 The best $200 I have ever spent!  I have done other ATV tours and there were always equipment issues or guides without a clue, but not here.  Steve is an expert not only on the outdoors, but also someone that respects nature.
