4 took my 17 month old for a hair cut and was pleasantly surprized.  staff were well prepared for a squirming toddler--books, toys a plenty.  not to mention the barber chairs are kid-sized and shaped like cars and animals.  hardly any wait and quick turnaround = no tantrums.  well worth the $16 in my book.
5 Have used the same stylist (Cheyenne) for more than 3 years. We've never been disappointed. You won't find a better venue for small kids to get a haircut without the drama of most adult salons. The kids even get to pick from fitetrucks, cabs or animals to sit on while stylists specializing in cutting kids hair work their magic. My biggest problem is getting my son out of the place with all the videos and toys.
5 Does anyone know how to find the ladies who used to cut hair here? My son hasn't had a good hair it since they closed. Becky was the best!
