1 I went to this gym twice and both times it smelled?  i could not stand breathing in this gym?  I went here with a coworker since it was close to our work, but ended up working out at the Surprise location due to the smell of the place.  Hopefully it has changed, but that factor would make me not want to go to the gym.
5 The absolute best gym to go to in the area. Being a member for the past 6 years has been nothing but a great experience. Nicest people, friendly staff, and everything you could possibly need in a gym. Great equipment, ranging from everything you need as a first time lifter, advanced bodybuilder, MMA, or just keeping your overall wellness. No fluff and what not, you aren't going to be paying an extra 10-20 dollars on your membership for the smoothie bar you don't use and a steam room... I mean come on stand outside for 20 minutes. Open 24 hours throughout the week and 10 on the weekend, you can always get in and lift. Always have guest passes available as well, have nothing negative to say about this gym! When I move ill be more upset about leaving this gym than leaving the town lol
1 You get what you pay for. It's cheap at 15 bucks a month, but the staff is very rude. They turned the lights off on me at 8:55 on a Friday night because they were closing at 9. They didn't even have the candor to let me know they were closing.  I had a 19 year old kid try to sell me ridiculously expensive training sessions. I will mostly likely be going to a different gym because it's always crowded, and they aren't really 24/7 as their sign suggests.
