5 I've been working for a company in Corporate Office Centers for a few weeks.  The professional level of service is unmatched.  They are truly their to help your business succeed, not simply rent you space.  The amenities and administration services are top notch.
5 The Kierland Corporate Office Center is a phenomenal place to conduct business. It has an unmatched level of service provided by Debbie, Kristi, and Erica who always have a bright cheery smile on their face everyday! If you need help they'll get it done, fielding lunch deliveries, moving you from office to office, and making sure all your connections are up and running are just a few of the wonderful services provided by this great staff. I've been in an office here for roughly 3 months and have been floored by the exceptional service provided.  If you need a SUITE office, (no pun intended) come and talk to this crew, they are great and I'm sure they will get your business operating at full speed the moment you move in.  Fantastic service, fantastic staff, and fantastic amenities!   Just a FANTASTIC office!
5 Great way to network and build your business with the backing of a multi billion dollar international company. They have a product for all of your business needs. Professional, flexible and effective. Ask for Mike for more info!
