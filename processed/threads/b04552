1 Haven't eaten BK is a while. It's greasier than I remember (i.e. Chicken fries). I tried the tender grill chicken sandwich - it was falling apart, soggy and not at all tasty. My hubby's burger wasn't that much better.
3 Okay for a quick meal. this place has a kid zone which keeps the noise down in the main restaurant...brilliant !
2 I like BK, but this one was gross!!!
