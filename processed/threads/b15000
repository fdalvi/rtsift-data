3 For a quick lunch, my friends and I would go here. Quick, friendly.
5 Yes..it is strange that I am writing a review for Subway. I get it!!!!!!!!!  One because I don't like Subway sandwiches and two..because it is flippin'Subway!  But I do have to boast about their new breakfast items that they just released!  I tried it this past weekend and trust me...was skeptical...veeeerrryyyy skeptical.  I had an egg and cheese omelet on honey oat bread and added bell peppers, onions and tomatoes! It was yummy!!!!  And...it was only $2.50! Sweet deal!  Definitely going back:)
5 You know what you're getting when you go to a Subway. This location is fast, clean, and gives good service for the 5 minutes you talk to them while ordering. I love Subway in general if you're in a pinch and want something healthy. They're everywhere so it shouldn't be a problem to find one, and the food is the same at all of them.
4 My love for Sandwiches is no secret.  Subway is my "go to" spot for lunch.  My usual order is:  Footlong BMT w/Italian Cheese Bread, Toasted, Provolone, Mustard, Mayo, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Green Peppers, Pepperoncini, Salt, Pepper, Oregano, Oil, Vinegar....$6.00 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eVNKGHD1H5vFYPqT9QjoHQ?select=swrkKMdi5WZGVSZMCoPmoQ#swrkKMdi5WZGVSZMCoPmoQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eVNKGHD1H5vFYPqT9QjoHQ?select=_cEc-SKt7jR8nSrAheo46Q#_cEc-SKt7jR8nSrAheo46Q http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eVNKGHD1H5vFYPqT9QjoHQ?select=gH77-M4aa5U2fQo8J-_4jA#gH77-M4aa5U2fQo8J-_4jA   The Sandwich Artists here are always good and get the order right.  I haven't had a bad Sandwich yet.  Return Factor - 80%
4 Subway is Subway and you should have correct expectations when you go there. They offer a variety of what I consider healthy sandwiches compared to other fast food options. If you stick to the daily specials, you can get out of there for under $6 for a 6" sandwich, large drink and chips (or cookies). I like that I get to personally instruct every ingredient that goes on each sandwich. That way, they are always exactly what I want. If you stray from the daily special, the price edges up to where I would consider other options that have premium subs (Jersey Mikes, Jimmy Johns, etc). This is my go-to place for a fast, inexpensive but good workweek lunch. The employees here are nice & friendly. The store is usually very clean.
4 Nice little location.  My sub was fresh and the servers are friendly.  They summer $4 lunch deals cannot be beat!  The only weird thing about this location is the seating.  There is not much and the layout is very odd.
4 Time for a review update.  This is one of my regular places to grab a Sandwich for lunch.  They do a very good job making a consistent Sandwich every time I visit.  The Sandwich Artists here should be recognized for it.  It can get very busy during the lunch hour rush, so I recommend coming here before 11:45 am or after 1 pm if you want to avoid the crowds.  I still order a Footlong BMT w/Italian Cheese Bread, Toasted, Provolone, Mustard, Mayo, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Green Peppers, Pepperoncini, Salt, Pepper, Oregano, Oil, Vinegar....I just can't seem to order anything else.  Once I find a favorite item in a joint, it's hard to change.  I'll keep coming back as long as they stay consistent here.  Return Factor - 85%
