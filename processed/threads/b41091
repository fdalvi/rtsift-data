5 Beautiful studio and awesome instructors. Such a positive environment no matter where you are in your yoga practice. Their locker rooms are beautifully done with the perfect amount of ambiance! I can't rave enough about this place. See for yourself!
5 I'm so happy with this studio!!! It's beautiful, clean & everyone is welcoming. Plus, it's a perfect location!!
5 Great, clean studio! This is the first time ice tried bikram yoga and I'm so glad I did. The instructors/owner are so nice and very helpful. On my first class they welcomed me and told me not to be nervous and just try and stay in the room, but if I needed to step out or take a break it was ok. Anthony was great!!  The studio is very modern and super super clean!! I took my mom today for the first time and she also enjoyed it.  Make sure you bring cold water and a large towel for your mat. They even offer yoga mat/towel rentals and have a cold fridge with beverages. Try this place, you won't regret it!!
5 New to Bikram , the three instructors I've experienced have all been very friendly. Small studio, straight forward, affordable prices.
