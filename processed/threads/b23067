4 Great store and the salespeople are great especially the guy who was voted #1 Drag Queen in 200__(?) for Las Vegas.  (Sorry I forgot your name and the year you won)  Love the clothes!!
5 Love this store! Great prices & beautiful clothes. The owner was there schmuzing about. He was cracking jokes and making sure all the customers had a great time. Will return everytime I visit Vegas!
5 Let's be real here.   If you want to get blinged out for any and/or all the clubs in Las Vegas in none other than in quintessential "Vegas style" come here.
