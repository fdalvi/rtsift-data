5 I have not been to the dentist in 30 years and had a ton of anxiety about going. Dr. Garrett and his staff made me feel so comfortable and relaxed. I had 2 root canals done and a cavity filled. The next day only minor discomfort and that was from my mouth being open for the procedures. They treated me with the upmost respect and did EXCELLENT work. The office is great as well! If you need your grill tuned up I highly recommend seeing this team.
5 This office is amazing. The receptionists and billing are very kind and efficient, the hygienists are all very thorough and comforting. Dr. Garrett does great work and makes it pain free! I recommend them all the time!
1 This place is a joke.  I'm giving it a star since I have too. The office is a beautiful set up. The service was horrible  starting from the front to the  back.  Worst customer service ever.  I do feel bad for people coming here. I been to way better places with excellent service and 5 star facility.  When people need dental work done they are looking for good service. Not some crappy place like this.  It's a long story but I'll keep it short. Hubby & I walked out ..  Don't come here if your looking  for  good service  but you might be lucky they need to do tons of cleaning with  there  front  desk staffs all the way to the  dental hygienist. The DR we didn't get to meet since we walked out
5 My husband was a patient of Dr. Garrett's and I recently went in as a new patient.  Jill did an awesome job with my cleaning and was able to get me numb for my crown appointment.  The whole team worked well together and had a seamless flow.  There were no surprises and Dr. Garrett was great!
