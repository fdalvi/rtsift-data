5 I had received three bids for my Patio roof replacement and  for a new roof for my rental. i did hired Arizona valley roofin, I am extremely pleased with the competitive price and professional job that Arizona Valley Roofing performed.   I would recommend their services to all. The project was completed very fast, they did some extra work without charging me, Scott Lund, Owner is a nice man. His crew did a great job of cleaning up after themselves and i was not even present.
1 I would not recommend this company.  I called them and they came out to see the job.  I asked them several times to send an estimate and they kept making excuses as to why they haven't had time to send it.  They kept making stories and promises to send it "tomorrow."  Finally after 2 weeks of stringing me along, they blew me off.  I am assuming my job wasn't big enough for them.  completely unprofessional
1 Doesn't even deserve 1 star!On 9/12 Scott(owner) came, introduced himself, went on the roof & took measurements.  He came to  door w/ papers, instead of giving me an estimate he asked for the bathroom.  Said he would email a quote by the end of day, & then changed it to next day. By 9/16, I still no estimate, so I emailed.  He called said that he had computer issues & will resend,their email wasn't working, & that I would have by end of business 9/16.  I didn't receive until following day, & it had just never been done because it had 9/16 as the date.  We talked back &forth about how it would go/colors/ timing, etc. On 10/1, I emailed him, my signed contract along w/the desired color. I called Scott that afternoon, he thanked me & said that he received everything & had ordered the product. We had small talk about how much of a range of there is between bids & the inconsistency w/ honesty about how roofing layers, or whether or not I needed a new roof, etc. during my estimate process.  He told me that unfortunately everyone isn't honest!  He told he would have product on Friday 10/4/13. I really needed to confirm start date as we were having someone else remove chimney & our swamp cooler & "capping" off that part of the roof.  I wanted to make sure that I would not have to worry about 2 places on my roof not having shingles, since it can rain at any time.  He told me that they would start Mon/ Tues, & that I definitely needed to have those 2 issues taken care of prior. He said that he would give me a call Fri & let me know if they would be starting Monday or Tuesday.  He never called me.  So Monday, I gave him a call to ask if were starting 10/7 or 10/8.  He called me back & stammered over the fact that my bid had been rejected--which didn't make sense because he is the owner, he created the bid, he signed the bid, & he accepted the bid.  He told me that he had mistakenly mixed up paperwork & given me someone else's bid.  He apologized,told me that he was sorry but he's a business man & he found the mistake & corrected it for me!  He told me that he would send me a new bid by the end of the day & that I shouldn't be concerned about the cooler/chimney because there is no rain in the forecast for 3 weeks. He called me back just a few minutes after we spoke & leave a long message about how "they" already had the bid ready.  He gave me a bid that was $2,000 higher, & again let me know that he was happy to have fixed the issue for me.  He also told me that he never received a color & that I would need to let him know! He then immediately called back after leaving that message & left another.  He let me know that since I didn't know how contractors work that I should call back who did the other work & force them to make it waterproof, because it could rain at any time because we live in AZ. He said that because "we" rejected the bid, that I was no longer in contract w/him & I was free to use another contractor.   He told me that he would be emailing the bid,it came on 10/8.  Written in the same handwriting signed by the same person- Scott Lund.  By the way, it's raining. He called &left me a message & said that he was glad that I let him l know that there was inconsistency in bidding, that is how he knew that he needed to revise his bid.  Now starting on the 7th & 8th I had begun receiving blocked calls- they ended up being Scott.  On 10/8, at 8:47PM,got a restricted call & was actually able to answer- It was Scott. I was irritated because I do not feel that is an acceptable time to call someone when it is not a predetermined time.  He proceeded to attempt to explain himself.  I told him that no explanation was needed & that I would be in contact.  He said, oh so you're still going to use us?  I said, I don't think so.  He snapped at me & said that there was no reason for me to contact him then.  He told me that he had only received color instructions & never received a signed bid anyway & that I was never in contract!  He continued talking & I told him it was ridiculous that he was even calling & I hung up.  He immediately called me back, he says oh, Teresa, I was just leaving you a msg.  I told him that there was no reason for that or to call.  He stated that I had to understand what happened.  I told him I did, I understand that I should have never chosen him from the beginning. He was irate & told me I was just mad because I thought I was getting away w/ something & he didn't let me.  I told him, nope I'm mad because you have lied on multiple occasions & you changed your bid because you could.  At this time he started calling me Elizabeth & told me to stop talking so he could explain himself. I asked who Elizabeth was!  He stammered some more & ultimately I hung up on him.  Mr. Lund has now called back &threatened to sue me if I proceed w/ the BBB.
