5 Office looks spotless, great pictures everywhere including on the ceiling when you are laying back in the chair! Everyone was soooo nice. Very attentive, always asking if I was okay, not pushy about "other" services like some offices. The dentist actually spent time talking to me and answering my questions. Genuinly nice staff. They actually make you excited to go back for your next cleaning!
5 Dr. Pam McMahon is wonderful!  Her office is beautiful and her staff is very nice.  Dr. Pam is great with my children too and has a way of talking to them that makes them feel comfortable and puts them at ease.
5 Dr. McMahon is a very competent and compassionate dentist. One of the things I appreciate the most about her is that she does a very good job explaining everything to you and that she makes sure you have a really good understanding of any procedures or treatment recommendations. You know exactly what she is doing or recommending and why. She gives you the opportunity to ask any questions that you have and she never gets upset if you ask a lot of questions. I have also had two different hygienists at her office clean my teeth (I am sorry, I do not remember their names) and both were very pleasant and did a very good job making sure I was comfortable. The office is very clean and very comfortable. Her assistants are also very attentive and helpful. Bobbi the office manager is very professional and helpful with billing and insurance questions as well as scheduling.
