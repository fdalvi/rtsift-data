5 Pretty cool store as it is right around the corner from my apt. Awesome selection of comic books with the latest issues. Owner Travis is very friendly and knowledgable. Store has toys, shirts and other scifi and superhero related items. Prices are reasonable. Has a decent back issue selection as well. Would recommend this store to others
