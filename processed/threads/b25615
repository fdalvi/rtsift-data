4 Not bad. I mean it's a national chain so it's pretty baisc stuff. But compared to other pizza nearby, I get my pizza here.
5 This is the best chain pizza in Buckeye!
5 By far the best pizza in town!! Drove an hr just to get a pizza from here!! And let me tell u it's worth it! It's literally better ingredients better pizza!
3 Un fortunately this is the best pizza in the area.  Just had it tonight because the dbacks won yesterday so it's 50% off here.  Chicken poppers were good tonight.  Not great food but not terrible food either.  Good for half off
