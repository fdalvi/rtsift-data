4 I've been coming to Nice Nails for at least 5-6 years now, always for a pedicure, and I absolutely love the place.    Husband and wife, John and Debbie, are the owners and both work as technicians at Nice Nails.  I don't know if the "Kim" that Yelper Janel mentioned is still employed there or not--I've never heard of her and have NEVER received poor service from anyone like she described.  My favorite techs are Michelle and Tina.  Kenny does great work as well.  They have (five?) pedicure chairs, all of which are big, comfy, easy to get into and have built-in massage and heat features (ahhhh...)  They also offer big poofy pillows if you happen to be a little smaller and need to be pushed forward a bit.  They start your feet off with a jetted spa tub soak before removing your old polish and running through the typical pedicure icky stuff (nail trimmings, cuticles, etc.)  They used to be able to "shave off" the dead skin from your heels but because of Nevada state laws are no longer allowed to do it.  Instead they use some sort of dissolving cream, let it sit, then attack the rough spots with an abrasive sponge.  I tell ya, when I found out they weren't going to be able to use the blade anymore I was truly bummed...but this new cream they use I think actually works better!  They also always use tools that come fresh from the autoclave so I know they're clean.  They have a good selection of nail polish colors and are not opposed to using whatever you bring in from home (just remember to grab it from them in case they forget and try to put it back in the rack.)   They're very quick to wash the tubs down when you're done.  I've made appointments and have also walked-in.  Sometimes there's a bit of a wait, especially on weekends but they're very efficient and get people moving without compromising the quality of their service.   Ten Toes Up from me!  :)
5 I've been going to Nice Nails since 2003.  Debbie is the BEST!  I drive all the way from the other side of town just have Debbie do my nails.  I have not been able to find any other nail tech that can do the fabulous job Debbie does with pink and whites.  I have never been disappointed!!
1 I have to agree with Janel. I went there a while back for a pedicure and had the same person. Her name was Kim.  When she put the little basket with her tools on the floor, I asked her if they sterilize their equipment. She said, "Yes, like this."  She proceeded to squirt some clear liquid on them, still on the floor. She was not gentle nor careful. I ended up bleeding because she cut one nail too short. That didn't seem to bother her, she said it was ok and dabbed some blue stuff on to stop the bleeding. She seemed very rushed - not the relaxing experience one would expect.  Not very cool about asking to be paid before the polish was dry, either. Please DON'Tgo there.
1 A mother working full time and having a 2 year old means that when you have the little spare time to treat yourself, you want to make sure it is at least a good experience when you get a pedicure. I came on my lunch break here to Nice Nails for a pedi & mani although I only got a pedi. The lady rushed through my pedi even though I was the only one there in the middle of the day so it wasn't like they were busy. She cut my big toe and I started bleeding. Instead of apologizing she accused me of having sensitive cuticles. I  was hesitant to put my foot back into the bowl afraid of catching an infection and she kept saying "don't worry it's fine" and stuck my foot in the bowl after she put some clear glue and started blowing on my cut which any licensed nail tech would know how unsanitary it is to blow on people especially an open womb! After i told her to please not to blow i caught her still doing it as she continued to rush through the rest of the pedi. When paying I asked for at least a discount she laughed as if I were joking she gave me attitude for a $5 discount...as if $5 is worth more than a return client. Praying I didnt catch anything!
2 I had gone there with a friend and I noticed it was very busy; like any other nail salon; i felt rushed and the nail tech I had; she did my nails quickly it was not bad for it being done quickly but I she did not listen to me when I told her to make them shorter; why do majority nail places rush and make nails long. Now that I look at it she messed up on a couple of nails; a bit pricey for this kind of service I would not suggest going there because they are just fast.
5 I'm happy I ventured out to try Nice Nails - they do a great job and have you in and out looking flawless.
1 DO NOT COME HERE! You're risking your health!  I had been here before about a year ago and everything was fine. It's close to my place so I didn't drive to my normal nail place and now I wish I had. At first, everything seemed fine.   Then I noticed the woman doing my nails was on the phone. She picked up the phone twice during my pedicure and talked for at least five minutes each time. That's rude, but what will make me never come here again is what happened next.   I was reading a magazine when she started scrapping my feet for rough spots. Everything seemed normal until I looked up and realized she was using a CHEESE GRATER to scrape my feet. I was in such disbelief I even asked her if that was a cheese grater. She laughed and said something in another language. By then, she was already done and there was nothing I could do.   To top it off, I saw her put it away in drawer without sterilizing it, which can only lead me to believe she didn't disinfect it before using it on me.   I took pictures of the cheese grater and am filing a compliant with Nevada State Board of Cosmetology.
4 I enjoy this place. They are quick with their service and still do a great job. Debbie and John, the owners, are very friendly and ensure everyone is satisfied. There are a great selection of color, regular polish and gel. Also, everything is reasonably priced. This is my go to nail salon!
5 I've been going here for about 9 years. I love it and everyone that works there is great. I only get mani pedis but the gel they use lasts a good 3 weeks. I've gone many other places out of a quick convenience and always regret it. Ask for Michelle. She is amazing.
5 Best nail place I have found near my house. They apply the gel polish on perfectly.
3 I recently went in here because I was desperate for a little relaxation and to get a mani-pedi and they were in my area.  I got there 15 minutes before they closed, but they were still accommodating and let me get a full set of acrylic gels and pedi.  They asked if it was OK that my nails were OK to be done as same time as pedi, probably since they were about to close, not my first preference, but I was just thankful they let me in!  I was a little nervous because I felt my acrylics were being rushed as she was moving really fast, but she did a fantastic job -- I highly recommend Ivy and will be going back to her!  The pedi wasn't very good and I only got a massage on the top part of my foot...super disappointed! At lease my nails look fine.  She did the callous remove and it looked like any other callous remove that was the "grater" type, but definitely wasn't a cheese grater, so maybe they changed since that last review.  They only got 3 stars because they let me in right before they closed and the acrylics were great, but wish my pedi was better.
1 Stay away from this salon for gel nails.  The girl that did mine was done so fast I didn't even get time to settle into my chair.  The bonding solution that they put on the nails to bond the polish to your nail was not painted on but just a quick swish over the nail.  So what that means for me is my nails are peeling in just one short week.  Maybe others do a better job, but most of these nail salons at best give you a shoddy job to get you back into their salon faster.
5 This place is amazing! The new layout is perfect for a high quality salon, and the prices are absolutely affordable.   ATTENTION: please disregard past reviews. Kim never worked there, the tools are 100% disinfected and sterilized before every use, and in case you didn't know CHEESE GRATERS ARE USED TO REMOVE CALLUSES. If you're not comfortable with cheese graters, you can ask them not to use it (but I recommend you do if you have bad heels, mine have gotten better because of the dead skin removal.)   I would recommend this place to anyone!
5 Favorite salon! Debbie the owner is super sweet! They are reasonably priced. Fresh and new ideas. I've been using them for many years.
5 After all these years I still love this place and the people who work here. Always accommodating, very fair prices and excellent customer service. They just recently renovated and the place looks gorgeous and seems much more efficient.   One thing I don't care for with the renovation is the new chairs--I'm too short for them. The kneading/rolling feature on the chair is too high and doesn't hit my back --it's actually at the back of my head height. They do still have a couple of the older chairs left as of this visit and Tina, my nail tech, suggested I move to one of the older chairs but I didn't since I'd already been soaking my feet and didn't want them to have to clean another chair. Next time I'll be sure to request an older chair.   Thanks John and Debbie for always providing excellent service. I love that this is a place where everyone knows my name. :)
5 Stopped in on a busy Saturday and they took great care of us!  I would highly recommend them.
5 This is my favorite place to get my nails done. All the ladies there are very friendly and they always accommodate my design requests. I always plan to be there about 2 hours so that they have time to work on my nails and therefore no one is rushed. My favorite feature is the massage chair:)
