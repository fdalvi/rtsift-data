5 We just had our wedding at the Full Circle Ranch. They made everything very easy and were a pleasure to deal with throughout the whole process, regardless of the last minute changes we made. The homemade breakfasts are delicious, and Sherri was even kind enough to give us one of her cookbook as a wedding present. The rooms were clean and comfortable with all of the amenities of any quality B&B. We would definitely recommend the Full Circle Ranch B&B as a location for any special event or just when you need a few nights away.
5 Everything about this place was great!! The innkeeper Sherry was awesome, the breakfast was terrific, and the scenery was stunning!! I highly recommend this B&B!!
2 The Full Circle Ranch is situated in a lovely area.  The rooms are kept meticulously clean.  The breakfasts are good though on the sweet side.  I found them adequate but for those with a heartier appetite, they may not be enough.   The Ranch's setting is in a beautiful, quiet area which makes it perfect for a relaxing stay.     The B& B owners are not on sight and have hired Sherri S. to run it.  If you are expecting a true B & B experience, this is not what you will get.  Congeniality is found among the guests who are staying at the Ranch but don't expect much effort from the Inn Keeper.    The website for the Full Circle Ranch was not correct in that there was not concierge service, special dietary requests were met with "don't eat it".  To use the hot tub, you must provide 2 hours of lead time or you will not be able to use it.  There are many rules to follow as Sherri runs a "tight ship."  We are low maintenance guests and found that even the smallest requests were met with resistance and were clearly an inconvenience.  This place has the potential to be a real gem with a lot of improvement in the hospitality area.
