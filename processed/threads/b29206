4 Right down the bottom of Leith, near the docks is this little gem of a café. Ironically named, the Kitsch element makes the café pretty cool. The tiny little place (seating only about 25) has excellent food, with sandwiches, rolls, paninis, baked potatoes and the their speciality - Pies straight from the Farmer's market. If you have more of a sweet tooth then there are cakes, pastries and other little goodies for you.   The drinks are excellent as well. For me the highlight has to be the smoothies, which are awesome, coming in a variety of flavours. You can also get teas, coffees and hot chocolate made from Belgian chocolate. Sweet!!   If you are more of the boozy persuasion, they sell a healthy (or arguably unhealthy) supply of alcohol with good beers, wines and a surprising amount of spirits. This comes in handy as the whole venue is rentable for all sorts of parties and gatherings. With such a small cpacity though, you will struggle to get a party atmosphere, but they give it a good go.
