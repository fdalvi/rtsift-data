1 i know restaurants get busy on friday evenings. i know this. but a half hour wait before our appetizers arrived? methinks not. fifteen bucks for 2 itty bitty springrolls, 2 lilliputian fishcakes & 2 miniature ribs served with bland sauces? methinks not. a small portion of fatty, gristly so-called thai beef over a bed of pineapple and undercooked vegetables? methinks not. comping our 2 beers and the fact that the dishes were prepared with the kind of care seen in cultures where thai food is a rare and exotic treat isn't enough to make up for that interminable wait. methinks not.
4 I love the food!!! I am a big critic when it comes to Thai cuisine and this was a great experience. I started off with the coconut milk soup (spicy) and it is one of the best I have ever had. You have a choice of getting it with mushroom (vegetarian) or with chicken... both are great! My main was a green curry dish which was AMAZING! I definitely will be back and recommend it. I went during lunch which is cheaper than at dinner time. The atmosphere is very nice as well. Go try it!
