5 This is an awesome University.
5 I will say straight up this review is biased because I attended this institution for my undergraduate degree. All that being said it was the best decision I ever made in my life. Not only did I get to study something I loved at a place where the professors actually cared and engaged with me during my course of study but it transformed me as a human being socially. WLU lives up to its reputation of being one of the most spirited and involved student body out of any other university in Ontario. I was able to find my social and athletic niches here while exploring other new ones that helped me broaden my horizons. The campus is small, and although growing rapidly, still manages to maintain a small town feel where if you really want to can know almost everyone. As a local that lived at home in Kitchener for 2.5 years of my degree rushing the Sigma Chi Fraternity at WLU was the greatest decision I ever made in my life. Not only was this the catalyst for engaging myself on campus and in what the university had to offer but the most valuable skills, experiences and connections I gained while in university came from being a member of that organization. Additionally I took the opportunity to spend a semester abroad in Australia at the Australian Catholic University thanks to great study abroad programs offered by WLU. I wouldn't trade my experience here for anything in the world, great education and great life experience that made me a better person.  WLU sure lives up to its motto, "Inspiring lives of leadership and purpose."
4 The campus is small and compact, thus as far as universities go it is easy enough to find your way around. Parking can be tricky, as the lot numbers are sometimes hard to understand/find.
5 An amazing University- you feel like you are part of a tight knit community but you still have the resources of a medium sized school in a city.  A great place to study, work and volunteer!
