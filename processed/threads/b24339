5 Neil is a consummate pro. We've had him put in blinds at both our old house and new and he's been on time with great prices and fast delivery and install. Will use again for all out future window cover needs!
5 For years we have been doing business with Budget Blinds of the East Valley for all our shutters, shades and blinds.  Owner, Neil Riley was at my home today for the 3rd time in 3 weeks.  I am in the midst of a re-model and didn't realize that every time a contractor finished, adjustments would need to be made on the length of our vertical blinds which were purchased for various rooms quite a while before the renovation began.  Each time I called to schedule Neil to come back and cut more off the bottom, he was willing and able to get here to do the necessary work in a timely manner (and with a friendly smile)!  He is a pleasure to work with and I have recommended his company to other friends and will continue to do so in the future.  Please consider Budget Blinds of the East Valley for all your window covering needs.
5 Just had Neil do the blinds for our rental home. The black out blinds were done first so he brought them out and hung them, then came out with the rest a week later - they look AWESOME! Now I wish I hadn't done the others myself (bought them at Home Depot) 4 years ago. The kitchen and the master suite both look great, thanks to Neil. Thanks!
