1 This person stole our images and posted them on her website as her own.  Do not be fooled, she is a fraud and not a real photographer.
1 As a fellow photographer, and owner of one of the images displayed on this company's website as their own, I'm incredibly dismayed with regards to how misleading and dishonorable their actions are. It is a sad thing that couples have to practically be detectives nowadays to protect themselves against unscrupulous behavior such as this. While I'm thankful to websites like PhotoStealers which actively seek to oust these kinds of people, it's a downright shame that they have to exist. Shame on you, Flickers. You do not deserve the title of Photographers. What you've done is steal, lie, and cheat. I hope and pray no unsuspecting couples fall for your horrible antics. Now that their website is down, I can only assume that they will re-brand and start over with a new name. Maybe this time they'll try to build a business through the merits of their own work - though I'd be weary to entrust them at all with something as important as wedding photography at any point in time. I find it unlikely that someone so dishonest and lacking in integrity from the get go would ever truly change completely. My heart goes out to anyone that fell for their empty promises and has hired them for their special day.
1 They also stole my photography work and posted it on their site stating it was their own.  Don't walk, RUN away from this company as fast as you can.  They are completely fraudulent.
