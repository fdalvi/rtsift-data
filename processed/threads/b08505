4 Less than one mile from my house. I like papa john's thin pizza. It's crispy and fresh.
4 While I don't generally order out for pizza, when I do, I'm usually very satisfied with Papa John's.  Their online ordering is great, and always winds up with a correct order.  They deliver within 30-40 minutes, and since they are close to my house, the pizza is always hot.
4 They take orders accurately and deliver in a timely fashion.
4 This is a great location as far as Papa John's go. Orders are always perfect and pizza isn't undercooked like some locations. Friendly staff too
