5 We are pleased to be the first reviewers of Mia Francesca. DC Ranch has been needing something different and we finally have it! This charming Italian restaurant, owned by a privately held larger company, feels like a locally owned restaurant. The restaurant is warm and inviting and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. We were immediately greeted by Lori, the catering manager who was kind and engaging. We met our server, the tall and statuesque Dora, and the meal began.She knows the menu completely and had recommendations.  The price points were reasonable- one diner nearby said, "FINALLY, we have a GO TO restaurant here with the right price point that isn't based around a bar." This is a charming restaurant and the food was exceptional. I am Italian and never would have guessed this is a chain. Beginning with the wine, the price points were reasonable. I would suggest a "house wine" carafe price for a red and a white and watch them sell like crazy. Wine snobs won't buy them, but regular people will......  Next came the delectable bread with the house-made extra virgin olive oil infused with fresh herbs. DIVINE. Dora warned us it was addictive and she was right.  Big Daddy ordered the spaghetti bolognese as he is a self-professed conneisseur and he loved it. It was rustic, with three different meats; fresh tomatoes; carrots; onions; and other sumptious items cooked for 8 hours. We are really picky about bolognese and I intend to order it next week. AWESOME. He asked for linguine and it was given! They have a whole wheat option (Big Daddy is big on fiber :)) and they only had a penne. Good choice, but they should consider a whole wheat spaghetti or linguine for people who want it.  Our Maximillian (14) loved the spaghetti with tomato sauce. I tasted it with a cook's palette and it was light, perfectly seasoned and good. I would order it myself for sure.  I had the Spinach ravioli. The ravioli was clearly house-made and the spinach stuffing was delicious. The tomato cream sauce and fresh spinach on top were great, only needing a few red pepper flakes (which I received upon request) to balance the dish out.   Dessert was tiramusu and flourless chocolate cake with chocolate peppermint ice cream. They were both delicious but the tiramusu won the day.  Finally, we met Jeff Cohen, Director of Operations for the West Coast for this organization. A lofty title that we are sure is well deserved. Most importantly, to us, he seemed like the sole proprietor of a local joint. That was the best. We came to find out that his daughter, goes to our son's school. A small world. He clearly takes personal pride in opening these restaurants. We would sure like to see more of him.  Thank you for a great new restaurant in our neighborhood!  Laurie, Rodney and Maximillian Malone
3 DC Ranch really needs a restaurant like this.  Good food in a comfortable and casual environment.  I was here Friday night and the place was packed.  I was able to get a seat at the bar for dinner.  I started with a nice glass of Barbera.  The bread with the herb infused olive oil was very good.  I ordered a caesar salad and their rigatony with bolognese sauce.  The caesar was good but a couple minutes later they came out with my pasta.  Bad timing and it made me feel rushed.  The pasta was really good though. It was a little creamier than a typical bolognese sauce and it had some pieces of shredded pork instead of all the meat being ground up.  The bartenders were nice a friendly.  I'll be back and hope to bump them up to four stars after they get the timing issues worked out with the kitchen.
3 We arrived early on Saturday night and had our pick up tables. On such a beautiful night, we opted for patio dining.   The restaurant is nicely appointed but tables are a little to close to one another both inside and outside. The inside was already noisy with just a few tables seated. Outside, the servers could not easily get around the tables closest to the outer railing and they were constantly saying "excuse me" to pass dishes across the table.   Bussers were way too eager to remove plates before others had finished their plates. If you follow my reviews, you know this is one of my biggest pet peeves! We have taken to ordering appetizers or salads first, then reserving our orders for our main courses until we have gotten well through our appetizers.  I hate being rushed.   We ordered a nice bottle of Conn Creek.  It was really lovely and fairly priced, especially for North Scottsdale. The bread with herb-infused olive oil was quite delish, although we didn't overdo it, suspecting that portions of our appetizers and entrees would be plentiful, and they were.   We started with the calamari fritti and risotto with wild mushrooms. Unfortunately, even though the portion was huge, the calamari was way to chewy and tough, and had no real flavor. The marinara sauce needed a little salt. (That seems to be the case with many restaurants these days . . . they go by the philosophy that you can always add salt, but you can't remove it.)  On the other hand, the risotto was spot on! It was well seasoned and perfectly cooked. You can easily make the risotto a full meal!  My husband had the shell pasta with ham, peas, and mushrooms in a light tomato sauce. It was the best choice of all. My stepdaughter had the linguine with clams, scallops and shrimp in spicy tomato sauce. Even with the "spicy" it was a little bland.  I had a pizza with mushrooms and eggplant. Initially, they brought out sausage and eggplant, and when I explained that I ordered mushroom and eggplant, they took it back and made another.  I also asked if they could make the pizza a little more well done. The correct pizza didn't come out until after my husband and stepdaughter had already finished their meals (and they are not fast eaters).  Seriously . . . they should have taken the pizza off the tab. As far as how it tasted, well, I had one piece . . . The mushrooms and eggplant were diced and not sliced which made it difficult to eat.  For the most part, I ate the toppings first and then the pizza.   In all fairness, Mia Francesca has just recently opened, and I think they need a little time to get their footing.  One of the Chicago managers who was there to oversee the opening asked about our experience, and I was honest . . . No doubt that we will be back as there are some really nice features that deserve a second chance.
5 I'm psyched about this place!!! Phenomenal pasta, try the spinach ravioli and the profiteroles for dessert. Light sauces make this italian place unique from the others in scottsdale. Sit outside.  Extremely friendly service. Perfect for date night!!
1 We tried this for the first time tonight. March 16. Two weeks after opening.  Party of four. Very uninspired to say the least. Cold food. Poorly spiced. Good service , i felt bad for the servers, they seem to know the food is crap...bland cold ...yuck.   The water was served with no ice   The calamari was as boring as fish sticks The pasta dish was cold and hard. There was no flavor to anything ....Boring chain. Don't bother.  I am holding back here. I could say much more. It's just a sad chain.  Pathetic.
2 Loved Mia in Chgo. Not so much here. The restaurant was hot. We asked 3 times to see if they could cool the upstairs down. Did not happen. I ordered linguine with shrimp, scallops mussels & clams. Not one mussel or clam. When we told our waiter ... :he said they ran out" Really? . We saw other orders served after ours with the 2 items,. We received our bill. An extra bottle of wine was added to our bill. They took it off but we had to catch it.  Won't be back again.
2 Wowza.....what a hot mess!  Food is pretty darn good (especially pizza), service is crazy bad.    The place was totally packed (on a Tuesday night no less), and I agree with others assessments; tables are crammed in together way too close. We sat outside on the patio which was pleasant, and not as loud as being inside. I seriously believe they also need to rethink the interior dining room which seemed very cold, cavernous, and noisy.  We had 2 kids & 4 adults & were made to wait......get this......one and a half hours before we finally got our entrees!  No joke.  The kitchen was so backed up & our server was so not wanting to deal, that we had to keep stopping people to ask what was going on, where our salads were, entrees were, etc.  Inexcusable, poor communication throughout.  The manager was completely unapologetic & clearly seemed like she was so over being there & dealing with complaints. We were also told by our server that part of the problem was that other people were sending their dishes back.....nice!  Unfortunately, such a bad experierence with the service aspect totally overshadows the food, which was tasty. I would describe it as rustic Italian cuisine.  We had the calamari, Margherita pizza, Risotto, seafood pasta, and pasta w/ ham, peas & mushrooms. Everybody enjoyed what they ordered, although I felt like the pizza was the highlight of the meal.    They definitely need to get their act together if they are gonna make it in Scottsdale.  Way too many good restaurants in this town, with much better service and atmosphere. Good luck Mia Francesca......arrivederci!
5 We had heard such good things about the Chicago Mia Francesca's that we were delighted to hear they were opening in Scottsdale. We arrived earlier than expected as traffic was light. No knowing the DC Ranch area we parked by the back of the restaurant and seeing a gate at the top of a ramp by the outdoor dining area, I approached a young busser and ask if we could enter there as our friend is recuperating from hip surgery. The young men cheerfully opened the gate and let us in the back way.  Even though we were 30 minutes early, the hostess was very accommodating with our seating arrangements as our friend requires a little extra leg room. We asked for and were seated on the patio. Service was very prompt and our waiter, Lilly was very helpful. We had cocktails and the bread and infused olive oil was excellent.  We ordered a couple appetizers Risottos with Mushrooms, Tomato with Blue Cheese and Red Onion, and Calamari. All were very fresh and ample enough to share.  Our main courses included Salmon, Tilapia, and Rigatoni Bolognese. The pasta was al dente and the fish dishes were moist, flavorful, and served elegantly. We learned Mia Francesca's forte was the freshest food delivered daily and our taste buds agreed .  Gelato and great coffee was our finish and we all agreed that this new restaurant was a great addition to our area and we would be back soon.
5 The best spot in Scottsdale, Kevin/Tracy get it. Food was fantastic. Portions generous. Priced fairly. Smelled like an Italian restaurant. Can't wait to return Do yourself a favor and try it. L O V E D. I T!  "The Kidney."
5 Went in for dinner a couple weeks ago with my mother and infant son. They got me seated right away, with a high chair in tow! Everyone was very accommodating, especially considering my son. Most servers scoff at having children but our server was wonderful with him!  me and my mother split the house salad and she had the pasta with eggplant, and i had the shell pasta with ham. All dishes were delicious and full of favor. Wine was very reasonably priced as well.   For being a busy night the place seemed really calm. Love this place and can't wait to come back for more!
5 On DC Ranch's Market Street, located in the same building where San Felipe used to reside, sits a new Italian restaurant...Mia Francesca. Only Mia Francesca isn't a new entity. It's been around for a good long while in Chicago with twenty locations. In other words, they're a solid act. Finally. After all of its predecessors who've come and gone on Market Street, it would appear this place might have some staying power. I can only hope.  The service was all of five stars...friendly, enthusiastic, informative and fast. The fast piece of it was surprising given every table was filled both inside and out. The food, even better with two nice surprises.  The rigatoni bolognese had a couple large chunks of braised beef, this in addition to the ground beef typically found in a traditional bolognese sauce. As I said, a nice surprise. The other was the veal medallions. I was shocked upon their delivery. Described on the menu as simply medallions in a light cream sauce atop roasted veggies and mashed potatoes, these were no ordinary medallions. A medallion in most restaurants is a small, silver dollar sized slice of meat approximately half-inch thick...if you're lucky.  These 'medallions' were mini filet mignons...three of them, cooked to perfection.  Seared and caramelized outside, medium rare inside. The roasted veggies looked like shitake mushrooms but they could have been another variety, not sure. The light cream sauce was truly that...very light cream with more of an au jus texture. So flavorful, it made me eat the mashed potatoes. And I don't eat mashed potatoes. Ever.  The pre meal bread was roasted and served warm. Crusty shell and moist crumb.  The house salad is large enough to spilt and I highly recommend the light balsamic dressing, slightly tangy but pairs beautifully with chianti or sangiovese.  Meal with tip was ninety dollars with plenty of leftovers for todays lunch. Truly a pleasant dining experience.   Nice job on getting the 'bugs' worked out so quickly on your new AZ venture MF. Keep it up and I can see where it won't be long before you have twenty locations in Phoenix, just like Chicago!
1 I have no idea about the food or service, as the restaurant was closed for lunch on the day I had a reservation for a party of 12.  They had an accident in the kitchen regarding a fire suppressant system.  I know accidents happen and they had tried to call me.  The very nice hostess made a point of coming to the door and took my name and number so that the Manager could call me to apologize.  Guess what, 2 weeks later - No Call!   Where does a party of 12 drop in?  It was a huge hassle and no call??   Do they not know about the longevity of restaurants on Market Street?   Better step it up.
4 The  Rigatoni Bolognes is FANTASTIC and the Ronsanto Chianti Classico is a new Fav wine of mine.  Cant wait to go back!
4 It's a little loud but otherwise a comfortable place.  Good selection of made-from-scratch Italian food.  Generous portions, very reasonable prices, attentitve and knowledgeable wait staff,  great flavors.  All around a very positive experience.  Glad that there was a gluten free menu for those who have issues with wheat-based pasta.  Modifying selections was not a problem.  Looking forward to eating leftoveres for dinner tonight which made the price/meal a great value.Glad to see a restaurant in D.C. Market busy since many places just don't make ti there.  Hope Mia Francesca is around a long time.
1 Have you ever gone out with someone, whom on the first date you thought they were the shit, but by the second date, you found yourself texting everyone afterward, telling what an asshole he or she was? Well Mia Francesca IS that second date.  My first experience (review) here was a phenom. Splendid in every sense of the word. My second 'date' was if Dr. Hyde himself had risen from the fictitious dead to run the show.  Ever the student of applied 'what the fuck went wrong' philosophy, I deduced the following:  If you're only mildly hungry, asking they split a meal, salad and glass of wine, there's sure to be someone in the kitchen reading your order who's probably jeering your presence, going; "Great. Two cheap assholes in C3 just ordered, two bowls, two glasses, two small servings of bolognese sauce, and all on one order....how'd we get so lucky!"  The rigatoni bolognese order, split, came in four separate bowls. Two with some dry as hell pasta, accompanied by two small bowls of bolognese sauce, not enough to mildy amuse the pasta. The sauce was horrible. In fact, it was the antithesis of all that's holy in Italy. Someone had ruined it by adding way too much salt. So much, I'm pretty sure I'd bloat and retain water for the remainder of my natural life had I eaten a full serving.   The house salad incorporated a balsamic that was much too tart, making me pucker like a criminal whose probationary sentence included going down on Joan Rivers. Anyway, it was bitter, tasting somewhere between bile and gall.  I'm not sure.   And the eleven dollar glass of house chianti was barely drinkable. The result of my asking the server to pick something good. My bad.   I would have, should have complained but the thought of getting a free dessert wasn't going to fix my swelling-up, resembling the Dora the Explorer balloon in the Macy's parade.   I'm going to chill on this place until the winter visitors return to roost. Since most are from Chicago, where Mia originates.  I'm sure THEY won't have a problem taking the manager aside and throttling him after tasting the Phoenix version of Mia.
4 Skip the reviews that reference anything about bad service.  Da Beau and I ate lunch, here, today and we had a very pleasant experience.  Yep, a solid four-stars.      It was our first visit.  I was familiar with Mia Francesca ("MF") as a friend of mine, who lives in Chicago, has, since God invented dirt, rated her local MF as an out-n-out favorite.  And her word is the ever lovin' gospel when it comes to food.  I mean, I don't even collect $200 -- I just go.  KnowhatI'msayin?  Onward, with the review!  Kyle was our server (and he might be the bartender, too) was very friendly, informative and attentive.  Then we find out he's a fellow Texas boy...which classifies his attributes as hardwired.  What's more, he treats his job like it was his own business; e.g., at the end of the meal he gave us a business card and added he would enjoy serving us the next time.  And there will be a next time and a next time and a next time.    Semi-quick facts, anyone?  (It's rare a Texan has a short story.).    -- Good, warm bread; accompanying olive oil was herbaceous and handily decanted from a table-set bottle -- Da Beau ordered a starter of (peeled!) asparagus with tomatoes and gorgonzola that was lightly dressed with a tangy vinaigrette.  The leftover tomatoes and 'zola were a treat atop the warm, oil-dipped bread -- We both ordered -- and consumed to the point of making a happy plate -- the barrumunda atop lentils and sauteed spinach.  This was our first tasting of barrumunda.  A moderately white fish, it is native to the rivers of Australia and reminded me of good ol' Texas catfish.  (Note to self:  fry-up a batch of panko-crusted barrumunda at home.).  The three fillets of fish, lentils and spinach were perfectly seasoned (read:  a smidgen of salt).    Again, pay no attention to the reviews, here, about bad service.  Yet, let's say those reviews make an impression.  Ok, if you have any reservations about dining here, go anyway and ask to be seated in Kyle's station.
5 WOW!   This place is brilliant!   I could not have been happier with the Salmon dish that offered wonderful flavors and the salmon was cooked to perfection- very refreshing!  The waitstaff was very friendly, maybe overly for my liking.   I expected the servers to be dressed more professionally to match the beautiful food and ambiance this place truly offers.   I was also surprised the staff wasn't as well versed in the wines they offered, I would have expected more articulation on their choices.   The chef came out to the table and was very informative about the preparation of the entries we choose.  Cannot wait until our winter visitors arrive.  This place was amazing!
4 Great addition to DC Ranch!  Really nice decor...comfortable, but classy.  Our server was amazing...great sense of humor and always there when you needed him.  The food was good too...big portions and very flavorful.  We tried some meatballs to start and they didn't disappoint!  The penne with ham, peas, and mushrooms with a light tomato cream sauce was very tasty...just way too much.
1 Gave this place a second chance. . . It will be my last! Pasta was under cooked. Roasted chicken was soaked in a rancid broth.  Risotto was undercooked and bland.  Mia must stand for Francesca's severs are M.I.A. Ambiance is dull.  Rigatoni was meaty but sauceless.  Over priced food for Macaroni Grill/Olive Garden quality food.  Huge disappointment for a neighborhood restaurant.
5 I second skipping reviews about bad service.    We being Chicagoans and calling the Elmhurst location our local go-to restaurant, we're elated that Mia's was open in AZ; so we made a beeline there as soon as our schedule opened up.  We were met with a smiling hostess who seated us promptly.  Waters placed on the table ASAP and Giuseppe our waiter came by to introduce himself all in a timely manner.  We ordered some wine and mussels (which are our favorite) and in no time at all we were enjoying the same mussels we've come to love back in Chicago.  I ordered Conchiglie ai pollo and the Chicken Romana....again, both tasted exactly like our favorite dishes back in the place we spent our youth.  After some small talk which Giuseppe was kind enough to correct my ever depreciating italian, we ordered a cannoli.  From start to finish it was like we're back home with all our family enjoying a great meal. I'm sure all the servers are fantastic but Giuseppe was the consummate professional and I deduce that he has a great amount of experience in this profession.  I'll definitely be asking for Giuseppe every time I go and can honestly say that it was just like back home.
2 Go ahead and skip this one.  We've been a couple times, and both were disappointing.  The food is only OK at best, and it's over-priced for what it is.  Food wasn't always cooked well, the menu options are same-ole, same-ole, and the flavors are underwhelming.  Service was mixed.  We'd have friendly folks, but occasionally would disappear.  Worse, on our second trip we sat indoors in the booths closest to the kitchen.  The place was pretty empty, and we picked up a scent of BO or sweatsocks in the air... not good.  The glasses also looked dirty, though it could have been hard water spots/etching.  It's a shame, cuz we eat in this area all the time, but we won't be going back.
1 I was so disappointed by my dinner here!!! I had a chicken dish that tasted really bad.  The sauce was runny and had an odd flavor. Everyone in our party agreed that the food just wasn't good! It's quite pricey too. I will NOT be returning.  I feel bad for them because a lot of restaurants go out of business on Market Street.  They really need some help here!
5 What a find! Great food. Trendy atmosphere. Great food. Attentive service. Great food. Did I mention how great the food Is at this restaurant-- Fresh local ingredients make the menu items sing-- big bowls of pasta -- plates filled with salmon, steak or chicken--come alive with homemade sauces--we could not put our forks down. This is a most comfortable  place for a great meal with family or friends. A special call out to our waiter Giuseppe who made our dinner out with friends a dining experience! Can not wait to get back for more!
1 Unfortunately this place probably won't survive long, cause the service is horrible. When we were greeted they didn't welcome us but rather asked if we've been helped (I would have thought it was pretty obvious since we were just standing there that we hadn't been helped). We then had to ask for bread and water cause no one came around to serve us any. As a matter of fact the waiter came to our table a total of 3 times (drink & food order, bring our food, and lastly to give us the bill). We were never asked how our wine was or even if we would like a second round. He also never asked how our food was. The waiter sat at the bar and watched football while we sat in confusion. I found it funny when we did get the bill that he lingered close to our table waiting for us to pay and go. Even though the food was good, it doesn't make up for the bad service. Someone else wrote MIA... MISSING IN ACTION servers. I couldn't agree more!!
2 I really can't think of any reason to go back and try Mia Francesca again.  It was just OK. The menu seemed pretty uninspired, and pricey for what you get.  We ended up sticking to the "special" menu where you can get two entrees for about $20.  My Chicken Marsala with pasta side was good, cooked nicely, and the marsala and mushrooms had a nice flavor to them.  The other dish we got was a Pasta Bolognese, also cooked nicely in a mild red sauce and generally good.  I wouldn't pay full $20 entree price for either of these, I'd rather go to Olive Garden and pay less for comparable food.  The service was OK, nothing great, but it wasn't bad.  The environment was nice, though it seemed a little crowded together and uninspired.  The bar was on the side of the restaurant itself, with TV screens playing sports events, which also detracted from the atmosphere.
5 What a delicious Italian restaurant in Arizona!  Being from New York and New Jersey, Italian restaurant's are had to live up to for this Jersey girl.  While traveling on business, I was taken to this adorable restaurant that resides in the cutest shopping center.  I wish I had more time to walk around.  The service was great.  The atmosphere was beautiful, we sat outside on the patio in beautiful spring weather and the patio was lined with a private fireplace all around.  It was very cool.  In addition to the great service and atmosphere, the food and drinks were superb!  I had an eggplant pasta, calamari and then nutella pizza!  I can still taste the sweetness and would go back just for the dessert!
1 What a disaster for lunch.  Arrived at 12:20 for lunch with a party of 11 and when we got there we were the ONLY people on the whole restaurant.  This was a business lunch and a big party so you would think the place would pay attention to us. WRONG.  The waiter was a slow as molasses and once seated it took 10 minutes for him to bring us menus and take our drink orders. Again remember we were the ONLY PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT!.   Finally after 20 minutes we order and our drinks some 35 minutes after we sat down.  Meanwhile the waiter and another guy were wiping tables and moving stuff on the patio. Who knows why, no one else was in the place.   After over 1 hour we get our food and several orders were wrong.  He does not apologize and challenges the person saying they changed the order and he brought the correct order.   Finally after over 2 hours we finished and it still took 10 minutes for the server to bring the bill.  No wonder this place was empty. Absolutely horrible service avoid this place like the plague. I will be sure to share this horrible with every possible person to let them know what. Horrible service, inconsiderate wait staff seems to be acceptable for this place. unless you have lots of time to sit and wait avoid this establishment.  Can i give them ZERO stars??? We finally walked out at 2:35!!!!  2:15 hours later....  Prior reveiwers are right that the MIA stands for the waiters being M.I.A.
2 Happy Hour Review:  When we lived in the northern Chicago burbs, we had a Mia Francesca near our house. It was always a special treat to go there, because the food was very good.    Restauranteurs Scott Harris (Francesca's) and Phil Stephani (Tuscany) are two well known Chef entrepreneurs in the Windy City who competed with each other. Now Scott Harris has brought two of his Restaurants to Arizona, Mia Francesca's and Davanti Enoteca.   AMBIANCE/MOOD: Francesca has a very upscale feel to it (photos). A lot of dark wood with some interesting lighting. It feels almost like a men's club. The bar area has a few small two person tables, along with some fours nearer the french doors along the wall and outside. It's very relaxed.   When we arrived around five pm and we were handed regular dinner menus. We had to later ask for the HH ones and were reluctantly given them.   The only server was the bartender Mike, who was doing double duty. It's somewhat quiet, except for the conversation of the customers. No background music, even the two HDTVs were on mute.    CLIENTELE: It's a mixture of young locals who work in DC Ranch and nearby homeowners in their 40s and 50s.   MENU: The dinner menus were as I had remembered them. Appetizers in the the $9-12 range and entrees in the $17-28 range. The HH menu had all of it's food item for $5.00, as were the drinks  SERVICE: As I mentioned, the one bartender was the only server. They had three bus'ers who worked very hard at keeping the tables clean and refilling water glasses. One even tried removing my EVOO plate as I was dipping some bread in it. LOL  FOOD: Francesca is known for it's marinara sauce, or gravy if you prefer. It's delicious and subtle. The only standout on their HH menu is their two meatballs served in a bowl with an insane amount of basil (photo).    The Margarita pizza was dry, with a few rough cut mozzarella slices and tiny amount of basil. You can see from the photo, the sauce had dried up, while the cheese had barely melted. The center was slightly warm and the pizza wasn't hot.   We also had the Roasted Pepper salad, with sun dried tomatoes and smoked mozzarella. The dish was overwhelmed by the vinegar of what I can only imagine was store bought jar of roasted peppers. It was unimaginative and tart.   PRICES: The Happy Hour prices were all $5.00. We also had two glasses of wine off the regular menu. A Hess Chardonnay for $7.50 and a Villa Antinoroi, which was a yummy blend of Sangiovese and Merlot for $9.00. Our bill total came to $34.32 including taxes, but before gratuities.   It would have been nice to have given them Three Stars for the ambiance, but the food was nothing special. We may come back to Mia Francesca for dinner, but we will avoid the HH in the future and stick to Davanti Enoteca. http://www.yelp.com/biz/davanti-enoteca-scottsdale#hrid:eX6AD3t8C1JpE5C3cOtcjg  Sorry!
4 We've tried the four cheese pizza, risotto primavera, rigatoni bolognese, bruschetta, burrata and an artichoke ravioli over three visits and I have to say, the food has been excellent each time.  I just had the risotto last night and it was delicious and perfectly cooked.  The oil that they serve with the bread is great too though their bread could use a little work (it's too soft and doughy).  We ordered take out each time so I can't comment on the service.  The portions are solid and it's pretty inexpensive.  I like the changing menu, it keeps me wanting to check back to see what's new.  My only complaint is their website...it's tough to navigate and, because their menu changes so frequently, you can't really rely on what they publish before you call in your order.  Be prepared with back up choices.
3 The one time I went, it was average northern Italian fare.  But don't waste your time, they're closed.
