4 Good pizza considering the price. Fast and friendly service.
2 I had higher hopes of being true mexican pizza like i got growing up.  I will say it was very cheap!!  I also love their marketing.
3 The service stammered me. My roommate felt it tasted like rubber. Well the 5 dollars for the large pizza was just the right price.
4 My family LOVES this pizza! Price wise it sure beats Little Caesar's in our opinion. The crust is awesome, sauce. We think it's the best $5-6 pizza you can buy. (We go to the one on 19th Ave/Glendale.)
1 This pizza is really good for its price. However this location is dirty. My boyfriend and I walked in and was looking at the menu hanging on the wall and there it was, this huge roach dead hanging there... ON THE MENU. At least clean it up so the customers don't see it. Disgusting. Now I know why the pizza was so good.
1 I would NOT recommend this to a friend. Actually I would warn a friend about this place. The atmosphere and service was very friendly and quick; but don't fall into the $3.99 for a large pizza trap. The crust is delicious, but when I got home I had to throw it in the oven to improve the looks of the pizza. I ate two slices and stopped there because it did not make me feel good at all. There was even pizza left over, which never happens. We actually ended up throwing the rest away. Granted, you get what you pay for and a large pizza for $3.99 is a darn good deal in a time of need, but not worth feeling sick over.
