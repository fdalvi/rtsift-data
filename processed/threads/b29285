5 There are a fair few amazing charity shops in Edinburgh, and St Columbas Hospice Shop is definitely amongst them.  Immersing themselves in the current trend for vintage, retro and "granny" fashion, the ladies who work in here are kind, lovely and window dressing machines! They have bunting, wool collections, a huge selection of crockery and appropriate places to set out their clothing. There is a wicker chair (not for sale) in the corner and loads of old knitting and craft books usually.  Whatever donations they get, they sure know how to display them in a delicious manner. You can't help but think this store is cute, quaint and full of hidden treasures in the form of great donations. This charity shop has got the task of displaying stock down to a fine art. When any lady sees the old vintage cushion decorated in ornate, pretty brooches, they'll be sold, too.
1 This place is a bit pricey. And whatever you do, don't try to haggle!   My girlfriend and I stopped in as we were walking back from lunch to our flat.  She inquired about an item, asking a clerk named Jess if she would accept a lower price for it.   "You're joking.  This is a charity shop dear."   To which my girlfriend replied with a smile, "Oh well, you haggle everywhere these days."   Jess then replied "Only if you're Pakistani."   Shocked into silence we said nothing for a moment. She then asked "Where are you from?"    I then said "What's your charity, the Aryan Nation?" and we promptly left. We will not be going back there.
