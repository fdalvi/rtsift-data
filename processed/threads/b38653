5 Our experience with American Dream Flooring, especially Michael Pham, was exceptional! Mike was right on top of the job every step of the way either by personal visits or phone calls. The crew that laid the floor was on time and professional. The same can be said about the crew that did the painting. We would use them again.  Butch & Pat Bowman Las Vegas, NV
5 Our experience with American Dream Flooring was a great one.  Khan had a person out to our remodel right away to measure, and gave a a price that was within our budget.  Michael and Quoc were also able to get things done quickly and to our satisfaction.   I've already referred them to a friend, and they were happy as well. Now why can't other companies run their businesses like theirs?
5 We have been busy slowly making changes to our Vegas house and we really wanted some flooring for the master bedroom.  We went to at least 6 different flooring businesses (including the Home Depots and Lowes) and no one had the dark flooring that we wanted except for American Dream Flooring AND at the best prices in town.    The service here was wonderful, we ordered our floors on Wednesday, had them by Friday and they were installed (by us) the following Tuesday.  It was quick and easy and the quality of the floors excellent.  No pushy sales people, best prices and a very honest assessment of floor qualities.  When we get ready to do the rest of the house, we won't have to go door to door shopping again, now  we know that the best price point and service is here.
