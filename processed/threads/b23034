4 As team manager for our company city softball league, it was my duty to get t-shirts. I got the number for Inkling from a co-worker and couldnt be happier with the results. Chris, the owner, is super friendly and easy to work with. I called him on Monday, a week before our first game, and had our order places within 30 min of calling. I sent him a PDF of our logo, team name, and he came back within an hour with a quote. My thought for price on 14 shirts was going to be around $150. His initial quote was $115. After seeing the details of the order and the shirt that was going to be used, I had him adjust it to use a thinner, lighter shirt. He quoted me again and this was cheaper...$107. 14 shirts for $107?! Where do I sign? (is what I was thinking) I gave Chris the green light and he had them 99% ready on Friday. I picked them up on Monday and was pleasantly surprised by his shop. Its kinda far up there, but its clean and very nice! The quality of his work is flawless and perfect! I definently will be going to Inkling for all my printing needs in the future
5 I have worked with Chris for several years and have never been disappointed! From corporate shirts to little league and travel ball events... from t-shirts to drawstring bags - to numbering and patches on jerseys! Inkling is always accommodating to my deadlines and the quality is perfect. Their pricing is the best in the valley and I will continue to use them for all my silkscreen needs.
5 Chris is great!! Had a mma fight coming up gave him a week notice and finished it sooner!! No need to look for more printing shops this is the place to go!!!! I will definitely go back!!!
5 Took my jacket in for a custom print on the back.  The owner was polite, friendly, informative and ultimately saved me $ by pointing out that I didn't need as many colors as I thought I did.  I'm an extremely pleased customer and highly recommend Inkling Custom Screen Printing.
