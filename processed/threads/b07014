1 Do not go to this vet.  They lie about how much exams are and services.  Bad customer service.  Also, for being "Petcare Animal Hospital" their hours are very limited.  I think NOT!  Save you money, and your time.  Go somewhere else.  You'll be happier, I guarantee.
5 I was referred to Dr Leuthner by a friend who is a long time volunteer at our local animal shelter, where he also worked.  I left a different vet who vastly overcharged me for a teeth cleaning, leaving me feeling quite betrayed. Their prices are good, the vet techs who work there are great and love our dog, and we have had good experiences with them since day one.  I'd recommend them as a very good vet who really cares about your pet's well being, and at a reasonable price
5 I highly recommend Dr. Leuthner.  He knows his stuff.  He's friendly and you can tell he really cares.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.
