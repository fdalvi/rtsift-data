5 Speaking as someone who doesn't like beer, their Bluffing Isn't Weisse was nothing short of amazing (who knew you could taste banana in beer?). They have such a wide selection of beers, there's always something to do (Nintendo, darts, shuffleboard, Cards Against Humanity) and you can check out the brewery area too. I love supporting local businesses, and the owner was super nice and attentive, and the bartenders are all educated when it comes to what kind of beer you'll like! Oh, did I mention they have food trucks? If you want a good craft beer, check them out.
5 Bad Beat Brewing is a sorely needed oasis in the sparse landscape of locally-owned brewpubs. Their dedication to quality and service will no doubt ensure a lasting legacy.   As the first beer joint to open in Henderson's booze district, Bad Beat is setting the bar pretty high for their counterparts. These guys brew in the back, pour in the front, and strive to create a friendly atmosphere that invites customers to settle in for hours at a time.  There's no kitchen here -- these guys devote their attentions strictly to beer craft -- and the results truly shine through. The beer is delectable, and all the easier to drink in the bright atmosphere of their front taproom. Food trucks will queue up on weekends to alleviate any hunger pangs, and the owners invite customers to order delivery if the trucks aren't around.  Such considerations lend true character to these new establishments. I can't wait to make this place a regular stop.
