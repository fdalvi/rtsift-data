5 I have been getting my hair done here for over two years. My hair stylist is Lonnie. I love how nice everyone is that works there and how many compliments I always get on my hair. I have crazy curly hair. From straightening it, it got damaged. My hair has never looked healthier! It has grown A LOT since I first got my hair done there. They arent to expensive as most salons are. If anyone I looking for a great salon go here!
3 I come to this Euphoria for haircuts because LOVE my stylist Carla. Outside of that, this Euphoria is nothing to write home about. The lobby is tiny and the reception staff isnt that friendly or helpful (although they are very nice on the phone). It's almost like your presence is an inconvenience and I can't count the number of times I've felt like I was offending them by interrupting their conversation to check in.  Carla is amazing though and I trust her with my hair. She listens to what I want and doesn't try to push any unnecessary changes or treatments on me. She's usually prompt but takes time with each customer-you never feel rushed.
2 This was the 3rd salon I tried out in Vegas after Diva's Studio and Limelight Salon. I came in for a a cut only. The stylist I had was real nice, and at that time had 2 years experience for hair. I asked for a bob cut. I liked she used scissors to cut my thick asian hair. My hair was shorter than I wanted and I wasn't too impressed by how the bob turned out. I wasn't too thrilled I spent $55 for it either.   I guess it's worth trying if my friends in the hospitality industry and at my government job were getting nice cuts here...Just not for me.
3 I want to give this place more than three stars but the snotty receptionists are preventing the upgrade. They're just not friendly and I always feel like I'm inconveniencing them every time I check in and check out. Oh, you don't want to be bothered with swiping my card for payment? Ok, I can just leave and have you eat the cost.  Carla still continues to be great-cuts my hair exactly how I want it and makes helpful recommendations when my hair needs a little extra boost. I'll still drive out of my way to see her because to be honest I don't trust anyone else with my hair, but never expect to be treated more than an annoyance by the reception staff!
5 Hello everyone out there, if you are looking for new salon to pamper you from head toes, come and check out the new look of Euphoria.
5 After reading reviews posted here I was ready for snobville and aloof customer service. WOW not even close the receptionists and staff were all very friendly and down to earth. I was greeted warmly and promptly upon entering building and had a nice look around. Nice variety of hair and skin care with some sparklies  aka jewelry thrown in my cosmetologist Carla was awesome talented and a great person to talk with and giggle like school girls. Yep I did.giggle . I will definitely be back ... if any wonder just ask for Carla she is awesome.. the other techs/stylists looked proficient and friendly.
5 I get my nails and hair done here all the time. Whether i need my hair and nails done for a photoshoot or i just need a hair trim. This is the place to go! My hair stylest is Pam and Brooke does my nails and i hope they will stay there forever!
4 Yes, this is a nice place to come to get your hair done. Very classy inside since the remodel. I had a horrible facial there! I heard a girl named Valerie is terrific, so I'll ask for her next time. The parking isn't that great though, you are in a large shopping plaza by Smith's, and you just have to find a spot as close as you can. I think the receptionists are friendly, not like the other post. I guess they treat you like you treat them.
4 Paul C is a great colorist and stylist - very glad to found him thru Paul Mitchell school!
