4 The name of this place sounds a little cheesy, cheap and naff, but this does not give an accurate reflection of the quality of the food and service inside.  The staff inside are friendly, efficient and seem to be constantly smiling.  The menu is what you would expect in most Chinese takeaways with plenty to choose from in the way of soups, curries, szechuan and sweet and sour dishes.  I went for the chicken Kung Po which didn't take long at all to be prepared and had an interesting combination of mushrooms, chillies and even peanuts.  It was delicious and I would have it again any day of the week.  This, along with a portion of special fried rice and a can of Irn-Bru, came to about Â£7 which was certainly reasonable considering the quality of the food.   If you're on Leith Walk, or even fancy a delivery, then Capital Chinese Take Away is well worth a shot.
4 Dont let the average sounding and seemingly generic menu put you off for this place, even though you will have had a million szechuan chickens from a million chinese take aways, this place is different - it seems every dish has a unique twist that nearly always makes the dish taste amazing.  Staff are friendly and more importantly they are quick - if you order here, you wont be waiting more than a few minutes until you get your meal. The take away service is equally efficient, which is nice.   A great place for traditional chinese food with a twist.
5 Best Chinese in leith by a country mile. If love a chicken curry then this is a must.
4 I have been going here nearly once a week since I moved here and would say it's the best take out option around this area. The girl who works the counter is always so lovely and the order is always ready when they say it's going to be. I think once I had to wait, but she was so apologetic and it's not a stretch to wait a few extra minutes. The food is the westernised version I think most of us know, but it is delicious and they gave amazingly generous portions of meat and seafood. We always get the sweet and sour shrimp Hong Kong style and the Szechuan noodles and they never disappoint!! A great go to when we don't feel like cooking. It also isn't expensive, and with the portions, so worth it!!! Lovely staff and lovely consistent food. Definitely a must if you live in the area.
5 gutted this place went out of business!! they were the best chinese on leith walk!
