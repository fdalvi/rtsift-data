5 I went to them originally to have my girlfriends Samsung Galaxy S3 screen repaired and they did an amazing job. It literally looked brand new. They quoted the repair at one hour and had it finished and in my hands in less than 40 minutes. The second repair I had with them was the other day and they repaired the glass on my iPhone 4S, (switched the color from black to white, and replaced the broken glass, as well as fixed the headphone plug in). They are extremely friendly and actually went out of their way to help us out. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, and already have.
5 My 13yo busted the glass on his Iphone and I brought it here.  1 hour and fixed.  Very good to deal with and fast.  Wish I would have found them sooner.
5 Needed my iPhone repaired (back light went out). Took it in to have it repaired by Sara...she is amazing!! She was working in the office by herself and had a ton of repairs.I told her not to rush with mine and saw how well she treated each customer and repaired their phones (iPads/devices) to perfection. It's hard to find someone who takes pride in their work and is affordable. I drove an hour just to get to this location, and would do it again, to have work done by her.
5 This company is great, I dropped off at 4 pm and was ready the next morning for pick up. No surprise costs added when i picked up which is always a concern as many companies do that to you. I have no hesitation in recommending this company for repairs to IPads screens if needed.
5 Amazing Immediate attention by Sarah Knew exactly what was required Happy to explain everything Very passionate and helpful Worth the extra cost Reliable service provider for your ever growing smashed up devices... esp the fragile Note 2
