3 Bring a torch, this place is like being in your shed. I wish they would ignite some candles.  Saying that though, the food was great. Rice was a little too soggy but everything else was cooked perfectly. The staff were keen, they got our food out in less than 5 minutes from ordering.  They loose points because the toilets were in a bit of a state, shame really.
5 I'm really puzzled by the only other review of Ignite as I have been here on many occasions and I think it's the best Indian restaurant I've been to.  The atmosphere is more upmarket than your usual curryhouse, the staff are very friendly, the food is fabulous (I particularly love the chilli naan and wish more places would make it).  I would recommend Ignite to everyone!
4 The tastiest Indian curries I've tasted in Edinburgh.  What I like about their cooking is that it is not heavy and oily like some other Indian meals I've tried.
5 Our first time here, recommended by a local.  Good and interesting menu - very flavorful curries.  Nice ambience and friendly.  Staff were very patient working with our large Christmas group.  Recommended.
