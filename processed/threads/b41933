5 Since this is a new location, i wanted to see if the roasted milk tea with grass jelly (half sugar no ice) was just as good as their other locations - and it was.  Please be sure to try this at least once!
3 Long line up on opening day! There were free samples of various milk teas and cupcakes.   Would recommend the Grass Jelly Roasted Milk Tea, it has more flavour. :) The milk tea is good, but I think you can get better value at Noon Moment down the street.... cheaper, just as good and shorter line.
4 The quality is what you'd come to expect from chatime. I'm happy to see one in waterloo. There is usually a long wait here but that's because its not your average bubble tea place.  I know it's tempting to have tapioca and a bunch of fruity flavors in your "bubble tea". But remember that you have come to the Starbucks of bubble tea shops. Try something new and unique. I highly recommend the Grassjelly Roasted Milk Tea. (less sugar no ice)
4 Came to visit my friend in Waterloo and she brought me to the new Chatime in town. We were there after dinner time and there's a line up in the store. The wait was ok cuz lineup is always expected when u want to get a Chatime anywhere in Toronto. Ended up ordering two drinks, one roasted milk tea with glass jelly and the other with pearls. Both tasted great. However, I would recommend to order half sugar as I find it a little sweeter than the other Chatimes. Next time I'll  try their mousse.
3 Super hyped up and a big step up from most bubble tea places here in Waterloo. I like my bubble tea made from real fruit instead if syrup and powder. They use syrups here. The good thing is that their milk tea has a lot more tea flavour than other places.   I have yet to try Noon Moment, so I can't compare. Chatime is just -really- expensive and you might have to line up for a little while. If you go, you might want to get your drink with less sugar because it's really sweet. I'm not sure I would go back to Chatime though.
