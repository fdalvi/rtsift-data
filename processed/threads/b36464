5 Super friendly staff! I came in here to get a gift for my mom and the staff was really helpful. They showed me all the special offers they had going on and what was the best selling. They even showed me some men's fragrances, which I didn't know they had.
4 My nose is a fan of their wall flowers :)  I like to keep the smell clean and neutral for bedrooms and bathrooms so I normally go with Sea Island Cotton and Fresh Linen.  They can be pricey, but they often have sales.
4 Bath and Body, they have been around for a very long time. I do not know how long this one had been here though. I have not been to one in quite a bit of time. But, I had some fabulous coupons so I thought I would check it out once again. Things are as I remembered them. Which is a good thing. It is not good sometimes when things change too much.  The deals are all quite good and you can find a lot of fun little stocking stuffer type things for a good price. Staff was nice and gave me even more coupons after my purchase. That is a good way to keep the peeps coming back for more.
