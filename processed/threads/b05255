4 This particular location is a little odd as they don't tell you your total until you get to the window and for a long time the speaker box didn't work (fret not - it does now), but I always see the same lady every evening I have stopped by for food.  She's always really nice and pleasant and double checks everything.  To me, that stands out since I've been to this location over a span of several months to a year.  It can be a little slow sometimes, but they do make the food to order.  Corn dogs are a staple here so sometimes I have to wait a few minutes, but they are the freshest, tastiest corn dogs around.  Root beer floats are pretty good here, too.  Sometimes the root beer to ice cream ratio is skewed one way or the other, so if you dig that then that's cool?
2 I find it strange that people like this place. The food is not good at all. I adore anything chilli cheese..and all of their chilli cheese stuff is pretty gross. I can make better hot dogs at home. I only keep coming back for their ice cream and lemonade float. Yum. But I really dislike the food. I've tried everything on the menu and have to keep coming back here..my favorite food is the jalapeno poppers which are delicious. I just buy a bunch of those.
3 Love the chili cheese fries. But........, The service was really slow. We were the only ones in the drive thru and no customers in the inside. It was 12:30pm and it took almost 20 min to get our food after we paid and they forgot our drink and we had to honk the horn to get their attention to get it!!
