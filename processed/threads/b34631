3 What can I say? Its Rainbow, really inexpensive clothing, some name brand such as SouthPole or Apple Bottoms and some just weird off brands.  Walking into Rainbow its a broke girls paradise! They have a plethora of colors and sizes, here they offer 0-13 and then the plus size. Both are in their own separate sections so it makes looking for clothing a breeze. The clothing isnt made all that great and some sizing is not correct but what more could a Vegas girl ask for?  Gripes:  It may say 2x but its really an XL. Some plus and even non plus clothing is off on the size. Colors! AHH Looks like a Rainbow vomited all over the clothes! Now some may like a bunch of different colors; I do not, I have a tattoo sleeve so a bunch of neon colors makes me look like a hot mess. Price. Some clothing is priced pretty reasonable while others (of course the few cute items I liked) were priced redic! Material. Here you get what you pay for. Its like "omg I found a perfect dress and its only 10$!" Ill bet 2$ it will end up shrinking or having a hole in it after the first wash. Return policy. The policy here is only 7 days, now I know that seems like a lot of time, but when you are never in the neighborhood and are in a rush to buy something, make sure you 100% love it. Otherwise youre stuck with 30$ of store credit 2 for the next 2 months and counting : )  Pros:  Workers are nice, to me anyway : ) Maybe these tattoos scare them : ) Im legit a gummy bear though! Store is newer and kept pretty clean! The aisles arent all in shambles and they give you an example of what items go together : ) score for the fashionably challenged lol. Reasonable prices on certain things Air conditioner works AMAZING! If Im on the area Id go browse just to be in the AC!! LOL. Ghetto, I know! Oh well! Realllly cute skinny girl clothes!  All in all, the colors are like Party Rock and the sizes are sometimes weird, but if you wanna look cute on a budget come here!
5 I give this place a 5 star because of their increasing stock of plus size clothing. Now, I hate to tell my whole life story but if you're plus size, such as myself. You will thank The Lord for ever coming into contact with a place like this. Plus size clothes are expensive as hell ! The ladies are always working their butt off in the store to make sure everything is easy too find. & there is always a sale going on. It's MY heaven.
1 This is NOT a clothing store. This is a wedding venue!! Please have Yelp update the name of this place.
