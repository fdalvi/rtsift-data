4 Well kept, good variety of stuff.
5 U dnt know what these ppl are talking about ! Messy .. Uhh yeah ... Apparently no one has been to the real messy ones like the one in Nellis ..anyways ! LUV THIS PLACE ! So much variety !!
3 This is one of the better Ross stores in my area (meaning within 15-20min) seems to be clean and well stocked when I visit most times.   Employees have always been kind, courteous and helpful. Always a good variety of items in stock, things seem to be pretty organized for the most part.
4 I don't know if it's just luck but I always find good stuff when I go to this location. You have to dig and hunt but I usually walk out with something. It's not very organized, always insanely busy, and a bit understaffed but if you have the time and the patience it's worth it. Every Ross I've ever been in is always unorganized...it just makes me feel more accomplished when I do find some treasures. To me it's a fair trade off for the great deals.
3 I love Ross, I buy my clothes and kids clothes here all the time. However, this location has some issues with the employees. I asked 3 different employees in the store for help getting an item down off of a top shelf and all 3 told me its not their department. This was so frustrating I finally left. Of course ill go back, Ross is awesome, but I will probably not go to this location.
