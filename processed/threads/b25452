5 Zeb Adams is my hero.  I had a very complicate home buying experience, just due to everything I was doing. I was selling a house in a shady neighborhood in Chandler, which he tried his hardest to do, while simultaneously living with a friend in Tempe and looking to buy a home in downtown Phoenix. This guy did it all.  I'm a little (very) controlling with big purchases and decisions, and Zeb was the kind of guy who could just talk you off of the ledge when things don't go your way. I could text him at 2am, he would text back. It was wonderful working with someone who was as technologically advanced as I was, because I maybe met him 4 times total over the course of 6 months.   I would recommend him to anyone, as he's just marvelous. I didn't really work with anyone else in the office, but I couldn't imagine them being any different. He patiently explained things to me (sometimes a few times), and pushed through all my drama and financing and the terrible treatment I had from other vendors.... who shall remain nameless (until I review them later, bwahaha)  Seriously, this guy is a pro. He know's what he's doing. Work with him.
