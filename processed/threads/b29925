4 This bar is tucked away in the Wynn resort, overlooking their "lake of dreams".  Like Parasol Up Parasol Down, it has a beautiful view of the lake, but unlike PUPD, it also has a beautiful view of the waterfall which is blocked by trees from the lake level venue.  The server we had was wonderful, even though he was the only one for the entire area.  It's small with limited seating, but we've always gotten a seat.  The limitation is in snacks, but that is not a big deal.
3 Beautiful view at North Show Terrace .... kind of makes the $16 margarita worth it.    Kind of.    Also, the misters are a great idea in theory when it's 106 outside, but they aren't so great when the water starts trickling off the umbrella and onto your head.
4 Best little tucked away spot in the hotel.
