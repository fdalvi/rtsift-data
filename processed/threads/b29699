1 One thing they teach you in Med School is "First, do no harm,"   They did me harm. They said they charged $250 to look for pool leaks but tech (Darren) told me when he came over that if I wanted the fountain checked, or the underfloor cleaner checked each of those would be an additional $200. I told him to just check the pool. Darren told me to keep the level lower because it was leaking around the top, and he put skimmer/underfloor valve back together wrong (or broke it, I need to get someone else over here to fix that). Why he messed with it at all, when I said to just check the pool, I have no idea.            Then Darren got hostile with me over the phone when I called him after I checked the system. Alex was good enough to come back over and look at the pool pump because it kept shutting itself off, but it didn't do that when he came over to look at it.              So now I have a filthy pool, a $500 underfloor valve that might be broken, and I just got another $250 water bill, so Darren's diagnosis was wrong as well. If you want to hate your pool, your life, and empty your bank account all in a couple of hours call these guys, they should work for the Government with that kind of service.
1 Got them from Angie's list where they have a great Rating.  Should have checked Yelp first.  They have been out Three times and I still have leaks.  They seem nice and all but two trips should have been enough to fix the issues.  After reviewing my itemized receipt  I noticed that my wife over paid them, and we are having difficulty in getting them to refund me an over payment.  They want to send a new invoice that matches what they were paid, because their itemized receipt was ~$200.00 less than what we paid.  The owner John, made several excuses looking for way not to pay me.  In my last conversation with him he said he would email me a new invoice and hung up.  Ask them for an itemized receipt if you choose to deal with them out.  If they refuse to do this, don't have them to do the work. Or call someone else.
