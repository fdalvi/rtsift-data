1 This now a Waitrose
4 While they can't quite compete with Tesco on some levels, Morrisons does have a unique charm that sets it apart from it's fellow supermarket chains.  Being a Yorkshire-based company, Morrison's origin shines through in their stores. The butcher and deli counters have an old fashioned market-town style aesthetic applied, and meat  and potato pies and pork scratchings are readily available. All it needs is a few whippets, and a bearded, truck driving serial killer to complete the atmosphere.  The fact that Morrison's do stock a few things a little bit different than the other supermarkets is it's main plus point. I've always been a fan of the old pork scratchings and though their competitors have now caught up, Morrison's were the first to start selling them in Scotland. Likewise the pies, cakes and bakery products just look and feel that little bit more homemade than elsewhere. The guys at the butcher counter even still wear what I can only describe as "butcher's hats", and it's those little  touches that  do it for me.
4 Here's a friendly fact for you - my brother helped to build this store!! Desperate student promised Â£1000 for 1 weeks work.....of course it didn't follow through. Nevermind.  Morrisons is sort of considered to be at the higher end of supermarket chains. Kinda. The adverts are really cool, although I can never get that Take-That song out of my head after they're on. And now neither can you.  The food they sell is of high quality, and the meat, cheese and deli counters are really good. They obviously know their stuff in here, they know the difference between Chedder and Mature Chedder.
