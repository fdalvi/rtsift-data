5 Huge burgers, very tasty. Perfect when you are hungry in the middle of the night. My order was ready in less than 5 mins and everyone there was super nice and friendly.
3 This Johnny Rockets is located in the Excalibur Hotel.  Very bright and clean, it offers a good selection of good old fashion hamburgers.  The burgers are excellent.  Very juicy like your mother used to make.  The fries and onion rings are another matter however.  These are both bland and taste like you had picked up a frozen package of fries for the local grocery store- very disappointing for the price.  The only bright spot here was the sweet potato fries; very good.
1 Ordered two simple burgers. An original with only lettuce, mayonnaise and American cheese. And a veggie burger with only lettuce, mayonnaise, tomatoes and cheese. We got an original with tomatoes and onions and a veggie with onions and no cheese.  Ended up being the driest and most terrible burger I've had. Should have asked for my money back, go anywhere but here for a burger -__-
2 Something was wrong with the produce - burgers made me and my kid sick. Awesome milkshakes though. Fries were average. Good atmosphere and friendly service. Wish we ate somewhere else.
