4 Pho Viet Nam Finally another Vietnamese place.. Opened today..11/1/2013...  Our favorite place moved, (phu thahn) so we have been waiting for something great without traveling far.... We got lucky, cause this place is it...  appetizer. Fried egg rolls.. Hard to admit, but these are the best i have had at any restaurant.. Spring rolls up next, and they were also very good, they didnt have that overpowering of mint so that was actually very good.. Both dipping sauces were a very good compliment as well..  entree. Wife had beef pho, and this actually beat our phoenix fave (da vang)... Awesome.. I had bbq pork, and was very good as well.. Only downside was that i am not a fan of broken rice, but that is minimal...,,,  now it will be whether they stay consistent.. But this will be a definite weekly stop until otherwise..  also since they just opened the menu isn't full yet.... I have some suggestions,see if they add them...
5 My wife and I both are from Vietnam. I lived there only two years and I'm an American. When I  was living there ALWAYS eat Vietnamese food and never western food.  I've been disappointed with most Americans making Vietnamese food that is not very flavorful. This place really impressed both my wife and I! She had broken rice and I had Banh Cuon (rice noodles and ground pork). See my pics. We will be back. Best ive had in phx..no bs. we are major foodies and really have high expectations. this place did not disappoint me.
4 Clean, great prices and FRESH. Staff friendly and had good ambiance. I love fresh spring rolls and #27
5 Went here for the first time yesterday, and I must say, this is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Chandler. The Tofu veggie Pho' was divine. Broth was wonderful, not too much sodium or 5 spice. Portions are generous and priced to sell! This will definitely become a weekly stop for anyone who tries it!!
5 I found this new Vietnamese restaurant on Yelp.  My family ordered 3 dishes: - Beef Noodle Soup with Beef Meatballs -Special House Broken Rice (Shredded pork, Steamed Pork Cake, BBQ Pork, Grilled Pork Patties) -Rice Vermicelli with Grilled Pork and Egg Rolls.  All dishes tasted awesome.  I think this is one of the best Vietnamese restaurant in Chandler, AZ.
5 Rule with any Vietnamese place is you eat what's on the sign. If it's a pho place, you eat pho. If it's a com Tam bi place you eat com Tam bi.   I broke the rule and had com Tam bi here - it was excellent!   You can tell they can cook - pork was soft and had just the right amount of char on the fatty parts. The steamed egg was moist and delicious - I've had some gawd awful egg before.   You can tell they care - vegetables were fresh and crisp. Presentation was very nice.   The service was great. Waiter made a mistake but admitted it - this is all it takes to turn a negative into a positive. He was also very tentative.   The pho that my friends had look pretty good too.   It's a new restaurant so I hope they keep up the level of food and service.    Overall, the Vietnamese food I had in Arizona did not compare well to orange County but this place was the exception. I will definitely visit here my next visit to Arizona.
5 Place is very clean and friendly service. I love the chicken Pho and the spring rolls are to die for. I highly recommend giving this place a try. Everything was fresh and made to order.
4 FINALLY I found a new Pho place!  After years of searching hi and low for a new Pho place I have found it.  I used to be a regular at Saigon Pho but after several bad bad experiences in a row I began my search.  Chandler Pho, Pho Nat, Pho Van, unPhogettable, and several others just did not have the flavor I was used to.    Pho Viet Nam has very good broth in their Pho Ga and the chicken was all very good white meat.  The broth had just the right amount of flavors and spices and the noodles we cooked perfectly.  The team was nice and mellow and the spring rolls were excellent.  I had them with Shrimp and Pork.    Unlike many of the aforementioned restaurants, Pho Viet Nam was nice and clean and the table had all of the needed accoutrement.  Service was very good with food arriving very quickly.  Looking to go back soon!
4 Have been here about once a week give or take, and the food has been very consistent. The pho soup base improved a bit, but it was already better than everywhere else. I have been here when it was slow and very busy and even then, the service has been very good. Glad to have this place in Chandler..  Pho Viet Nam, staff n Crew... Keep up the great work..
4 After a shopping expedition at Walmart,  I had an intense craving for pho.  Should have just gone home,  but I had to satisfy my urges.  I'm glad I did because pho vietnam was a great find. I yelp searched for the closest pho.  It was between saigon pho and pho viet nam. I have been to Saigon Pho so I thought I'd try something new.   It was a 6pm on a Tuesday evening and I was the only one in the entire place for my entire meal.  Hopefully they picked up after I left.  My beef pho #16 was delicious!   Broth had good flavor,  plenty of meat and noodles,  and the price was right.  My favorite pho place in the valley is unphogettable in Mekong Plaza, but their prices for everything is $2 higher than here at pho viet nam. So being cheaper is always a plus!!  I will definitely be back!
4 Clean and friendly staff. Had the Dac Biet soup and spring rolls. Overall, tasty, would recommend to an out of towner as a safe bet. Hits the pho craving you just have to add your own spices/sriracha.
1 Restaurant with bad tasting water to me is always a bad sign. It tastes so bad almost made me gag. It had very strong bleach smell. My hubby ordered a lemonade and even that had very weird taste. BBQ pork dish I ordered was cold and it came with steamed pork cake & shredded pork which  were cold as well. My hubby ordered pho tai and the soup had weird after taste. I'm pretty sure they use the same bad water with their cooking. Not to mention their slow service and flies in the restaurant. We were very disappointed and will never return again.
5 Excellent best tasting pho place in east valley.  Great service, clean restaurant, good portions, good prices.  I can see their volume ramping up quickly so hopefully they staff up to keep up.
5 Ate there today for the first time.  We had spring rolls.  Beef Pho, and a BBQ Pork plate.  Everything was delicious and fresh.  Our waiter was friendly and offered suggestions based on what we liked to eat.   The restaurant was clean and well lit.  The menu had some great looking items on it.  I wanted to try more.   The Pho was HUGE, hot and tasty!   My suggestion to the owner.  Get rid of the yellow "country kitchen", flowers decor.  Make it look like a Vietnamese restaurant.  Lose the Xmas decorations.  5 Gallons of paint, some inexpensive art work, some friends and a case of beer will get the place remodeled and looking proper.  I've seen way too many episodes of Kitchen Nightmares, and Restaurant Impossible to know that mismatched decor can kill a place.   Other than that, we'll be coming back!  Welcome to the neighborhood!
4 This is the best Vietnamese food I've had in the Phoenix area. They have a limited menu but most of the dishes are done well. I sampled banh xeo, pho, bun bo hue, banh cuon, and bun thit nuong. I would order any of those again here. The service is a bit slow for Vietnamese food, but the prices are fair.  To be more authentic, I would suggest they add banana blossom to their BBH and offer ngo gai (culantro) to their pho herbs. I would come much more often if I lived close by. The food is much better than any of the Viet places in Central Phoenix.
4 Yay, slowly but surely Vietnamese restaurants are making their way more east. Hopefully we get one in Gilbert soon!   Anyway, this morning I placed an order over the phone and went to pick it up. I ordered Pho Dac Biet (with everything), Banh Cuon (steamed rice rolls), and Cha Gio (eggrolls).   I didn't eat the Pho but I had a taste of the broth and it was pretty darn tasty. The Banh Cuon was good, also. I was pretty excited that they had this on the menu. It's one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes. I only know of one other place in the valley that offers this. It's not quite as good as the other place but its still pretty good that I would come here again for it because it's more convenient than the other place. The fish sauce vinaigrette that came with it was good also. Not overly potent. The eggroll were okay. Not awful, but wasn't amazing. I was a little disappointed that it did not come with lettuce and herbs to eat it as a wrap. This is how it's usually served at Vietnamese restaurants. I actually ended up slicing it up and mixing it in with my Banh Cuon. :)  I can see this as a place I would put in my dining rotation. Hopefully people pick up on it and it doesn't close down like previous occupants. There was only one table of diners when I went, while Hoosier Caf√© next door had people waiting out the door!
5 Great service and very clean looking,  the staff is very courteous and helpful,  it has a feeling of family.  Very low prices and really big portions. So far I've had four different dishes and no disappointments. Highly recommend.
5 I have been coming here now since this restaurant opened, and I've never once been disappointed! The beef pho broth is delicious, delicate and consistant. It's clear and slightly sweet without too much spice. The owner saw me glancing in the kitchen as they were straining the broth and told me it's a 24 hour process they do each day to ensure maximum body and depth. They do not disappoint! They take special requests and make you feel very at home. EAT AT THIS PLACE OFTEN! This is the kind of business we need to support! Very reasonable prices for fresh, delicious food and kind atmosphere!
5 I go there for the Mi Quang, but it sells out fast.  So, call ahead of time if you want it.  It is so amazing and authentic.  We like the spring rolls here, too.
5 The pho was great #13 is my favorite  Tom the general manager was very nice.     Very clean place great prices. This is the closest place to Ho chi Minh that I can find  oh the cafe sua da. (Expresso and condensed milk).  Rocks.
5 Inspired, authentic, amazing. Spotless restaurant and friendly attentive service are the icing on the cake at this authentic pho house. The ox tail broth is rich and layered in flavor, waiting for the always fresh jalapenos and sprouts. Don't forget to try the spring rolls as well.
5 Phomazing!  Seriously.  I have had lots of pho but never with filet mignon.  It was delicious.  This place has made the top of my list. The price point was perfect. And fountain drinks in a Vietnamese restaurant was a first but welcome change for me. I also had the fresh spring rolls which were good but the pho stood out.  Give this place a chance, I was happy I did.
5 Food was delicious. Service was great.
4 I always love checking out new pho places, and this one did not disappoint.  Service was great and the pho was tasty. I didn't see an option on the menu to get extra broth and I didn't ask, but as we were leaving I noticed they had different sized bowls displayed on the counter, assuming it was the different sizes you could order. Wish I had known so I could order a larger size, but at least now I know for next time.  I will be back.
4 I work nearby and get a take-away. The pho is great and everything is nicely packaged and waiting for me when I get there. Spring rolls were OK. Egg rolls disappointed - dunno what's wrong, they just weren't tasty. I would echo one of the previous reviewers, I'd like to have cilantro in the herb mixture. I'll definitely frequent this place, it's very convenient for me and the prices are very humane. :)
5 Best Viet food in the Valley. They've expanded the menu a little bit since opening. Love the banh cuon and anything with thit nuong (bbq pork). I've never had it too dry like at other places, and it's properly charbroiled with great flavor. I don't mind driving from Central Phoneix to get here for good food.
4 Delicious! I grab takeout at least once a week. We love the pho and the BBQ pork but I love the spring rolls more. The egg rolls are also perfectly crisp. They have expanded their menu and added stir fry. We had one last week and it was fantastic. Prices are comparable to other pho locations. Give it a try, you won't regret it.  Unfortunately, they are closed on Mondays.
4 Do I love this place? ummm..sure..kinda... Do I like it. definitely.  As you can see I'm a little indecisive at the moment about if I love this place.   What I love is their filet mignon pho for sure!  Please no tendons or any of that chewy stuff I cannot handle texture for the life of me!! Reminds me of octopus.  Cannot Handle That!  *cringing as I type*  I tried the noodle Banh Cuon and was extremely mad at myself for not being safe and ordering the amazing pho in which I don't even know if they carry the filet mignon anymore.  I will be bummed if they stopped carrying it.  The Banh Cuon taste wise was fine just nothing much going on really.  The reason I am giving them 4 stars is because I felt like the service was a bit lacking even when it was dead slow at night for us when we were the only ones in there at the next 30 minutes and the Banh Cuon felt like I was gonna chip a tooth and be cautious because of the stuff they put in the middle or inside who knows?!    The fact I had to be that cautious with my food over nerves is annoying.  I always want to try new stuff is that so much to ask for and not be nervous to eat! What the heck!  As long as they still have the filet I will be a continuous loyal customer.
5 This is by far the best Pho that I've had in AZ. I am from WA state where they have many Vietnamese restaurants and I haven't been that impressed with any here in AZ, but Pho Viet Nam was awesome! Their broth is SO good. BIG bowls, not the large bowls you order and end up getting a small bowl. My wife got the Vermicelli Noodle Bowl with BBQ Pork and Egg Roll, and that was one of the best I've tasted! Quality ingredients; no skimping here. Super clean restaurant, great service, friendly, great environment/ambiance. Tommy stayed and chatted with us and made some recommendations. We will be back again, and again, and again.. We found our Vietnamese spot!! :)
4 It is very hard to find good Vietnamese food in Chandler. I have tried them all and they all pretty much suck!! However I tried this one and it was exceptional. The pho is better then any where else in the area however still nothing special. But the bun bo hue is awesome. Probobaly the best I have ever had in a restaurant. The banh cuon is very good also. The bun tung nuong is also very good. So I have given up on trying to find good pho in the valley and will stick with bun bo hue at pho viet nam
4 On a whim, we decided to have dinner at Pho Viet Nam, we were in the area & had never been there.  I am always looking for non chain locally owned restaurants that offer a nice change in atmosphere, culture & diversity.    As we entered, it was obvious to see that the place is clean and offered an inviting feeling.  As we sat down, we were greeted by the staff, very friendly.  He offered some suggestions as we advised this was our first visit.  We chose the Spring Rolls for the appetizer.  I will strongly recommend them, very light & tasty.  We ordered #'s 25 & 26.  Both were delicious.  The food was fresh, and flavorful.  It was also light yet filling, not greasy or oily.  The portion size was perfect, not too little & no need to take home half.  The pricing is right on!  This is a great addition to Chandler, giving us another choice for a nice evening out for dinner. Pho Viet Nam, being a new restaurant I have to say GREAT JOB!  Wishing you all great success & longevity!
5 Yummmm. I'm surprised to find such good Vietnamese food in Chandler but what can I say? This place is great.  Lots of parking in the strip mall. Lots of seating in a big restaurant. Decor is simple and what you'd expect from an authentic place that focuses on flavor. I loved the 70s Beegees soundtrack playing in the back.  Vermicelli bowl with beef was so delish. The beef was tender and well seasoned. Loved the fresh mint mixed amongst the fresh greens. Portion was big and I was very  full after just half the bowl. I sampled dishes my friends ordered and each was wonderful and flavorful.  Prices are reasonable, and service is good. I will be back! If you like Vietnamese food, this is where you need to eat.
4 We passed by this place several times and decided to try it after all the yelp reviews. This place did not disappoint!  I had the rice noodle with grilled pork and egg roll. Very tasty grilled pork and egg rolls. Hubby enjoyed his broken rice with pork as well. I will come back and try Pho next...
4 Great Pho.  The Buon Cha Gio Thit Nuong was okay, not as good as we've had at other restaurants.  The Cha Gio by itself though was fair, needed more pepper though.  I think it was the Nuoc Mam that just didn't have enough flavor to it.  The Goi Cuon was also excellent, I would recommend the rolls with the shrimp and pork.
5 I saw this place as I was toting my daughter to and from the Summer school hosted at Chandler Prep. TOTALLY reminds me of being back in San Jose, CA where all my favorite Ph√∏ {and Bahn mi} places were... Alas,  I was/am seriously down with a summer cold right now and NOTHING makes a cold better or faster than Ph√∏, just nothing! This place has hit the nail with its broth!  I had the #13 which was PHENOM! and the man had #38 (sOOper yummy!) and the little one had a smaller bowl of what I was eating.  We all lapped up the soup, macked on the those tasty veggies and gobbled up the noodles. Let us not forget the cafe sua da like an espresso flavored miracle! To coin a phrase from Noor B., Yummmmm!  When Po's dad excitedly asked if he got the "noodle dream"!!  This is the DREAM he was referring to!  :D  Eat here!
5 We live this place. The first time we tried the place no complaints. Open 7 days a week and close to our home. We love to get the Pho Thai with extra meat on the side. The spring rolls are nice and fresh along with the sauce. Good price for food and we are weekly customers ^_^
4 Love this Pho place. Close to my work, excellent pho, friendly people, and great environment.
5 Delicious food for a great price! Broth is clean and clear! Egg rolls are fresh and delicious! Extremely friendly service. Definitely our new favorite Vietnamese restaurant...A must try!!!
4 Fast friendly service. The BBQ spring rolls were fantastic! We both had Pho- the meat was flavorful and tender , even in my chicken pho. We will return!
5 Great family style Vietnamese restaurant. Tip is to to order dishes off the menu with pictures. You will love the food there ! Nice quick service as we'll.
4 Very good customer service for a Vietnamese restaurant.  My husband had the pho, I had the #83 (rice noodles with bbq pork and egg roll).  The pork was very tasty.  The sauce that came with my noodles was a bit bland.  The pho was okay.  Portion was good, just enough to fill us.   We will be back to try other dishes
