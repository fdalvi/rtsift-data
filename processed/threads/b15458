5 It is fast and easy
2 Probably the worse subway I have eaten at. The bread on 3 sandwiches we ordered was stale and falling apart. Service was slow and the restroom was scary. I was very disappointed with this visit.  Subway is eaten often, not sure I'll ever come back to this one.
1 Really skimpy on to toppings. Rude customer service. Check out person was on the phone during the entire transaction. I avoid this subway.
