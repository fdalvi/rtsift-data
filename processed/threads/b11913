5 Great coffee.  Free wi-fi.  Rotating student art. Tasty sandwiches.  Cute barristas on which I can develop crushes.  What's not to love?
4 My neighborhood home away from home! Spacious and not too undergrad-ish, I love its soft, melt in your mouth cranberry and blueberry muffins. Their iced chai is a perfect, never too sweet blend.Thumbs up for giving its employees a picture/bio board. Just wish it would stay open later.
5 Adore (and miss!) this place. I used to work v. close to EE and ate lunch there on a daily basis. Everything is very fresh with lots of great choices. I didn't eat in often but it's a great atmosphere to just sit and chill or to get some work done.
4 During my two year stay in Madison this was a great coffee shop (and I would guess that it continues to be). Their specialty was normal coffee (as opposed to mochas and cappucinos, etc.), and it was one of the places where I began to learn to like coffee that is unadulterated (though I still like a good mixed coffee drink from time to time). The service is very good. The food's decent (although I confess I haven't ate their much). Overall, it's a great place to get a cup of coffee and just get some reading done. (Oh yeah, I had one date here as well, so I suppose it's a good date place too.)
4 Come for the coffee, stay (or come back) for the excellent fresh soup, sandwiches and smoothies!  Would be 5 stars if the service was more consistent.
3 Great little cafe with electric blue walls--quite a refreshing ambiance.  There's something about that color that gives you an extra surge to finish up your paper or win at a game of Scrabble.  Would recommend it as a study haunt if you live in the area. Friendly and fast service. Nice murmur of conversation to keep you company in solitude activities such as writing or reading.
3 I've been here a few times to get my study on.  Disclaimer:  If you're over 22, you're going to feel really fucking out of place at Electric Earth.  If you're the sort of person who gives a shit about that, you'll stay the fuck away.  It's not like there's anything to miss when it comes to the food.  Christ, who fucking goes to a coffee place for the food.  Aren't these basically glorified study halls?    The standard shit  - 2 bucks for a medium coffee (unsure about refill price)  - 5 to 6 for a sandwich   - wifi not used enough or recently to give opinion on reliability
2 They should call this place Eclectic Earth Cafe.  I came here for a sandwich.  I ask the barrista to male me  his favorite.  He makes me a fancy named sandwich that was just a ham and cheese plus cream cheese.  Cheeses were more than double the ham.  The rye tasted more like old wonderbread than rye.  Awful.  Wi-fi was sporadically on and off,  even though the place wasn't busy.  I have to give them some credit.  A couple comfy couches and nice lighting with florecent bulbs.  Half a wall has a funky mural.
5 Oh wow, just polished off an "electric salad" with added turkey and ham, probably equal to having an orgasm.  They charge $1.00 for extra meat.  The mix of vegetables was GARDEN fresh.  Cucumbers were crisp, onions packed a punch, and the tomatoes super juicy.  Yeah pretty much the best salad I've ever had.  Which is a bold statement but true.  My buddy Brandon ate a "Cali Delight" sandwich, which according to him was also phenomnal.  I am going to drink this large ice coffee and smoke a cig.  God I love Madison.  Oh yeah, the salad, extra meat, large iced coffee total cost was $9.  What a steal.  I would have gladly paid $19.   Oh and free wifi, which is what I'm using to write this review.
2 Electric Earth is just barely on the West side of Madison which doesn't have as many vegan options as the East side of town. So I'm glad that they're around and that they offer a couple of vegan sandwiches and some vegan baked goods.  That said this place is, at the end of the day, your standard generic independent coffee shop: brightly painted walls, random retro furniture, free wi-fi and nothing in particular that you couldn't get at any other coffee joint in any other college or major town in the country.  I had a "tofu you" sandwich ($7.25) and a cup of loose-leaf Darjeeling tea ($2). Kudos to them for having loose-leaf tea, even though they commit the cardinal sin of offering Oregon-brand as their only chai. Too many independent coffee shops refuse to go the extra step of making their own chai; instead they rely on those awful tetrapak cartons of Oregon chai, which is disgusting and not worth the oil it took to package and ship it.  The sandwich was okay; it consisted of baked tofu slabs with tomato, lettuce, olives and a thick, spicy tomato-garlic sauce, but was poorly constructed and not hot (temperature wise) enough. Also, the bread wasn't toasted, which seemed like a major oversight. It wasn't a good value on a whole.  I passed on the vegan cookies which looked old and stale. Maybe I came on an off-day.  In any case, Electric Earth has lots of room for improvement, namely by making their own chai and by improving their sandwiches and vegan baked good freshness. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if nothing else downtown were open, this is a decent enough spot.
2 This was next to my ex's old apartment.  We always got coffee there in the mornings, whoever was up first would hop over and get some coffee.  Usually it was her.  The coffee was ok, looking back it wasn't worth a trip to the place next door.  The food?  Don't get me started.  It's the most inadequate food I've ever had to pay for.  The bread was stale, the meats were boring, the vegetables were weak.  Because it was next door, we'd eat their from time to time.  And it honestly wasn't that great.  Don't go out of your way to eat here, but if you happen to live next door, it's an ok stop for coffee.  Although, I must admit: it was nice to kick back in the outdoor dining area and relax with a coffee.
5 Days of yore... lounging languidly in the Wisconsin sunshine, watching the cumulus clouds go by, strolling from my place on Doty St to Electric Earth.  It's amazing how memory works, right?  The sounds, the tastes, the smells.  When I remember my college days at Madison, I remember Electric Earth... the yummy kale soup, the West African stew, the garden pesto sandwich, the granola and yogurt and the Cafe Miel.  I spent a lot of time here, curled up in the brown chairs, catching up on my reading.  It used to be my vital life source.  After living in the Bay Area for two years, I have yet to find a cafe that quite rivals the feel-good hippy-dippy vibe of E.E., and I hit it up every time I'm back in town.
2 Pretty good coffee but stale environment. Shakes are good though!
4 I'm in! Really simple and really delicious menu, I suggest the ham and Havarti sandwich on rye (ham, Havarti, sprouts, and cream cheese). The street art mural on the wall didn't hurt either.
4 This place is everything I love in a coffee shop!  Friendly staff, good coffee, and outdoor seating!    I was in town for business and able to walk to this coffee shop on the recommendation of my sister-in-law. I love having an actual coffee mug for my drink when sticking around and I love even more having an option to sit outside with it.  They have a large amount of seating inside as well as multiple tables outside.  I can't wait to go back!
5 Was here for a wedding and it was amazing. The vibe was fun and the food was great.
5 OMG, I haven't written a review for this place yet? WTF? This is totally my kind off coffee shop. Good music, study vibe, excellent coffee and food. Love it.
4 Coffee, and tofu, and smoothies, oh my!  This place is a unique blend of fair trade coffee and vegan sandwiches. I used to live in the building next to it, and it was a curse to my wallet. The locale is perfect for a quick breakfast, or dropping in for a light lunch.  Overall, I would say their smoothies are their best offerings. They manage to churn out a pretty healthy product (using honey and yogurt) while still scoring pretty high on the tasty scale (blueberry was always my favorite, but raspberry and mango are also excellent).  Stop by if you're a zenned out artist or a yuppy crunching numbers. An ideal place to work or grab for take-out.
4 Cafe' in the best sense of the word...live music, awesome coffeehouse treats, & free Wi-Fi....bring a friend or a good book and you'll be happy to settle in for short visit or a long day of studying, when the roomies just don't know how to use their inside voices..:-)
4 They brew coffee from Anodyne in Milwaukee. So good!
5 One of my favorite cafes in Madison.  Coffee is great, and they are one of the few places in town that makes Italian soda pop with the proper amount of syrup (which is: a lot).  I'm not a vegetarian, but I love their salads and vegan soups.    Best thing is that the dining area is nice and QUIET.  So many cafes these days have blaring music and/or shouting customers with the noises echoing off hard surfaces.  At Electric Earth the music is low and soothing, the other customers are using their inside voices, and I can have a conversation at a normal speaking level, or just sit on a couch and work in peace.
4 A great place to study. Nice table space to lay out your work, quiet music, free wifi, outlets. Only have had their fresh brew coffee. All their sandwiches are under $7 dollar. They also have smoothies, tons of fancy coffee drinks and fresh bakery too.
4 Great coffee and breakfast sandwiches. Their lunch sandwich menu is huge, tons of options at a reasonable price. Cozy vibe.
1 20 minutes to make a sandwhich and acting like that's not unusual?  No thanks. AVOID.
5 Has anodyne coffee from Milwaukee (best I've ever had in my young life) makes a nice San Francisco BLT (BLT with guac) served with a side salad. Great place to read a book or study.
4 First thought that crossed my mind as I walked in here:" What?"  Second thought: "Where am I?"  I swear, Electric Earth Caf√© is something straight out of Willy Street (totally not a bad thing btw).  From their out-of-this-world art (aka filled with weird nudity and mother nature motifs) to their empowering quotes on the walls, Electric Earth Caf√© would blend in perfectly in inner Brooklyn or The Mission in San Fran.   You should come here just to immerse yourself in a completely different world.   Oh and the free wifi, comfortable sofas and fresh salads aren't too shabby either.  With a decent selection of coffee and "earthy drinks" (hot cocoa and apple cider!) at lower prices than most coffee joints, Electric Earth Caf√© will call out to everyone's inner hipster (even if you didn't know you had one).
1 I was unhappy right from the start. They only had one person working and we were standing in line waiting for him to get off his phone and take our order. The food was very average. Stale bread and brown avocado. They also didn't have the sandwich I wanted but only told me once they had brought my husbands food out. It was way too expensive for what I got. There are so many great places to go to for lunch and instead I decided to try something new and give this place a chance and I regret that choice. I will never go back there, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Very unhappy and my stomach hasn't felt right since eating that dry sandwich earlier today.
