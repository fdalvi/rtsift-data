5 We used Nanny's and Granny's last night to look after our toddler while we went to dinner and saw a show.  They were awesome!  The sitter called us the day before to introduce herself and showed us all of her license/background check materials upon arrival.  And Pat was wonderful with our daughter.  She brought a little stuffed toy and a Vegas-bling necklace for her to keep, and by the time we left, they were already playing Candyland.  Our daughter had a great time--and my husband and I had a wonderful and relaxed evening out.  Will definitely use this service again.
5 Jackpot!!!!  We came to Vegas for a family trip. We brought our 3 kids. We used the service twice while there. They had the best rates for 3 children and I felt the cost was very reasonable. They where very easy going and open to time changes. We had to change one of our reservation days because we got too tired at the pool and it was no problem. No charge.   Angelina was our sitter and she was so kind and very loving. I was able to relax and enjoy my husband because I felt so comfortable with her. I left Vegas feeling like a winner.
5 Went to Vegas for a convention had my daughter with me.  I needed a childcare provider I could trust with my daughter, I called and spoke with Sara about the service they provided.  I booked a time the  sitter showed up on time and connected with my daughter quickly.  I felt comfortable with the service and the price and will use again if in town on business.
5 This service is great! I don't trust anyone with my son but I felt comfortable using this company. Olivia was our nanny for the evening and I think she did a fantastic job and was very attentive. Sarah, the owner is one of the nicest people out there :)
