1 I got a Deal Chicken for weight loss shots and supplements. I was up sold after being thoroughly convinced that my deal chicken plan was useless. $350 later I believe I've been scammed. I can't use the meds I've paid for because of an allergy and one treatment is a ridiculous starvation diet. I'm going back to see what I can recoup.
5 I go here 3x a week for my B12 and love it. B12 really makes you feel great! After many months of B12 I started the HCG and have lost a ton of weight and am still losing. The gals are nice and the place is very clean.
5 Great service! I get my b12 shots from here and can say that they are fully affordable and work well. I agree with Sarah, the girls are very nice and the center is very clean. I would recommend this to anyone. for people who say these shots are useless, you are wrong. You have to stay healthy and also exercise but don't blame the place you go to! Thanks girls!
5 I bought a group on for b-12 shots from this place and had a wonderful experience. They are very quick and convienent. Also very friendly
