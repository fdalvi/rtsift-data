5 Thank you for always doing a great job for us Bryon! Fast , friendly & affordable service.
5 Great service, Affordable!! I wasnt ripped off like most Arizona AC companies in the summer! I will for sure call on them again! Thanks for keeping our family cool!
5 I was very impressed with the service and knowledge of this company.  The team goes above and beyond to help their customers.  I would have no issues with recommending Canadian Air Heating and Cooling to anyone.  Great job with a professional attitude.
5 If we could give Bryon 10 stars, we would! This company, and more specifically, the owner/AC tech himself, are AMAZING!! He is super personable, honest, ethical, qualified, and skilled. He follows up- he's punctual- he does NOT over charge- its just such a breath of fresh air (hah!) in an industry where some people take advantage of overheated and unknowing customers.   Byron was referred to us personally by someone who used to be in the industry himself (which spoke volumes) and for our first interaction with him, I called because my mom's AC went out. He was there almost immediately, climbed up, and fixed it after several hours. When he gave us the price, I couldn't believe it- I almost felt like paying more just because of how great he had been. But he had my business for life anyway, so...  This last week, we had a unit go out in our home which we JUST rented out so we could take work in California. He communicated with us, the tenants, ordered parts (which were on back order) and even followed up to check on the parts and hustle the supplier along some. Again, the whole experience was just so refreshing. I wouldn't go anywhere else, and couldn't recommend anyone else, any higher!!!   Thank you Bryon, your ethics and skill are much appreciated and relied upon!! =)
