1 This business is not a place that I would return too -  They do a coupon on the Fry's receipts - good idea - but then they only have a FEW shirts that qualify for the coupon and the prices for a normal item are HIGH!!  $10.00 for a simply summer dress, $4.90 for a womens' BLOUSE?? When i asked about the dress it was because it was LONG?   There are other cleaners in the area that are overall fair priced and do not do this "bait and switch" tactic that i feel this place does!   Coupons should be an opportunity for a place to GET new business and keep them - not make them say no thanks!
1 This place is way too expensive for dry cleaning in Phoenix. I also live in Los Angeles and I don't even pay these prices there. Dry cleaning services are pretty standard from location to location, but they seem to think they can charge outrageous prices for their services. They are nothing special and I won't be back again until they lower their prices.
1 Do not use this dry cleaners.  They do not accept responsibility for damage to the garments iothey clean.  My husband took a shirt in that he picked up the day before.  It had a huge rip down one of the sleeves.  The response he received was "it happens".  A $70 shirt ruined!  There was no apology - instead he said it was a "used" shirt.  Aren't the clothes we take to the dry cleaners to be cleaned "used" clothing?  What a ridiculous remark.  Luckily we have other choices for dry cleaning in Anthem because we will not be returning to My Cleaners.
