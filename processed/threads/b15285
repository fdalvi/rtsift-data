5 One of the employees from tap came to our house arriving early which is always pleasant. He came in I told him the problem and he got right to work. He fixed the situation within minutes and them politely asked what else he could do for me. He was nice, professional, and hardworking. He was not there to take my money or prolong his visit to make more money. I will use them as my electrician from here on out.
5 I had an issue yesterday with a main bad breaker which was leaving me without AC in the hot Arizona sun. I spoke with the owner of the company who had an electrician out to my condo almost immediately. Thanks to Tap I now have AC again, I will use again and recommend to anyone!
