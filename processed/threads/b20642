5 If you're a student in Edinburgh.....or if you're in Edinburgh in general, you HAVE to get a barbour jacket, dah'ling.  Seriously, the quilted pattern has become somewhat of a trademark in George Square, alongside Jack Wills slouch-pants and back-combed, back-sprayed, and dragged-through-the-hedge-backwards hairstyle. And that's just the men.  I went in with my mum, hesitantly, as I knew the stigma that came with the seemingly innocent jacket, but I was quite impressed. There is definitely a style - quilt - but there's a lot more to it than that. I ended up buying a wax jacket for a mere Â£69 and I wear it all the time. Yeah there is a stigma, but not for all the jackets! The staff were really friendly too and ordered in a jacket for my mum, and even though she didn't buy it in the end, they were really lovely.  I'm just worried about the condition of my hair now...
4 I went here today to buy a new coat.  The shop is attractively laid out and the staff were very helpful.
4 Expensive? yes. But it is a brand so you know what you can expect. What was my most pleasant experience was how friendly and very service minded they are. Missing a buckle, button or your cuff is torn? They will try to replace all that free of charge! Does Barbour come with a lifetime manufacturer's guarantee? I don't know but their service point to this. The shop is well stocked and you find it reminds you of the country. Gentlemen country. Waxed coats, leather bags, padded undercoats and boots. I only have a bag from them and if I only had more money I would get lots more. Their stuff is quality, proper and timeless. Very pleased.
