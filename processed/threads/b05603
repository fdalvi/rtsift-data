4 Thanks to Tiffany B's review, I made the long sweaty trek to Speakeasy the other day. I needed a bottle of Bourbon to bring home to Canada;  the land of crappy liquor laws and inflated prices.   It wasn't to bad getting there in the end. A couple stops on The Deuce and a couple more blocks to the East in the blazing sun. I was hoping for more of a selection of the magical Kentucky beverage, but hey, I can't complain, these guys seemed to have a bit of everything behind the counter.  No Bulleit, no problem!  I picked up a respectable bottle of Knob Creek for $36.  The same bottle in Vancouver costs at least $53.  So Yay for American Booze and Yay Yay for Yelp Vegas!
2 Stinkeasy Liquor  Wow, this liquor store is filled with cigarette smoke. The patrons playing video poker near the door are doing their best to polish off a carton of cigarettes as quickly as possible. The guy working in back stocking the coolers has a cigarette hanging from his lips.  I would give only one star but they have a respectable collection of beers for a place of this size and the cashier was friendly and efficient. My wife asked him if the no smoking sign at the door was a joke, he said he'd given up on trying to stop people from smoking as nobody listened to him. I guess its hard to get the customers to refrain from smoking if your coworkers are chain smoking their way to a portable oxygen tank.  If you visit this place you'll find a decent selection with varying prices but I suggest you wear a respirator and as little clothes as possible so you don't have to do laundry as soon as you leave.
4 Need to stock for my brother arrival for March Madness . . . stumbled across this place while out looking for a liquor store.  With our tastes, it is sometime hard to find what I need . . . Speakeasy had it all . . . one stop and back to the Casino for some good drinks and some great basketball.
