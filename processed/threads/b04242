3 Good food if you like arbys
3 This would be my local Arby's.  I go here every once in a while with a coupon.  This time I went because I wasn't eating meat for a month and they had a special on fish sandwiches.  I should have known better than to expect a place specializing in sliced beef to have a great fish sandwich.  But I will still keep going back for beef and cheddars.
1 This is the SLOWEST drive-thru ever. I waited for 25 minutes with two cars in front of me...what ever happened to "please pull into a parking space and we'll bring it out to you" to avoid holding up the whole line? Cashier apologized, asked me if I wanted sauce and offered free chocolate pastry. Guess what? No sauce and no chocolate pastry to be found in my bag. Seriously, if I ever want fast food in my area again I'll just drive the extra mile to Sonic.
5 The furnishings were clean & updated. Had greasy smell when walked in door, but I expect that from fast food establishment. Everything we ordered was exceptionally fresh. The bread was fresh, staff sliced the roast beef fresh. The cooking area appears clean and the staff was friendly. I'm glad we stopped in. $15 for two to eat (drank water) and one yummy Salty Caramel shake.  Almost didnt stop in because of last review. And, they play American country music if anyone is interested (im not fond of it, but it is different for Phoenix, AZ).
1 No coffee here this morning. I pop in now and then because it's right by my work but they don't always have coffee ready.
