5 Now I've been to my share of car washes in Las Vegas - as a former rep throughout the valley, I've washed several company cars as well as my own and the mrs.' vehicles. GlassHouse Carwash is without a doubt my favorite place to get a wash, both for the excellent quality and value and the family who runs the business! Where else can you get a spotless Hand-wash or an Express Auto-Wash all in the same location? The attendants are fast and courteous and like most of the places that I frequent that I love the most, they pay attention to the little things - pre-rim cleaning, floor mats, door jams. The Express Hand-Wash is about the best value in town and the Special Service extras they offer (tire and rim dressing, carpet shampoo, etc.) are easily the cheapest I've seen in town!   The family who runs the carwash/gas station has been a fixture in the community for some time and it shows - almost like you're getting a professional wash at ma and pa's! I'll definitely be back for the Deluxe VIP Hand Wash before New Years! Need to get the ride looking clean before the 1st!
5 I've paid $150 for auto detailing that wasn't as good as the $20 car wash I got here. I'll be returning regularly.
1 You've got to be kidding me.  I called these guys and asked if they could do a hand car wash and they said yes.  When I got there I asked the guy at the counter for a hand car wash.  "Hand car wash?" the guy asks.  "Yes" I said.  After a few moments of lack of eye contact, shuffling of feet and some mumbling he has another guy come over.  That guy looks out the window at my car and asks why I want a hand car wash.  Obviously, he's trying to get me to run through the automated car wash machine instead.  At this point I told them to forget it and walked out.
5 Great service!
5 Chose this car wash because of the good reviews, even though there was a car wash across the street from my hotel (which had several negative reviews). My car was washed, hand dried and vacuumed. Service was great!
