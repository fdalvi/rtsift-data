4 Too expensive but really yummy.  I like the seafood crepe.
4 The crepes sweet and savory are pricey but so good.  $7-10.  Two favorites, Berry and the Mont Blanc.   Mont Blanc had pears, nuts and whip cream and caramel.
3 Decent crepes, my husband and I each ate our own savory and split a sweet and it was a good sized meal. I had the prosciutto crepe and it had a lot of meat, would have balanced better with tomato, I think. The Nutella sweet crepe was very yummy. The water is $4 for half a liter and the receipt shows it being a full liter and that just bugs me.
3 It's a fun snake when you're on the strip.  I often go here with friends to have the seafood one.  That's my favorite.  It is expensive, but one crepe is enough to fill you up.  I never buy the drinks though, I just have my bottle of water in my bag.  :oP
1 This place was pretty bad. We got the nutella, fruits du mer, peanut butter & bananas, and the mixed berry crepes. The only one that was good was the peanut butter. I think a lot had to do the poor quality of the ingredients. Would not go back.
4 The bananas foster crepe is the best snack ever!  Mmmmm.....
5 Without the Creperie we would have died. The line for the buffet was so long at one point we actually got in it, I went to get coffee and then we said "screw escalation of commitment..we are out of it" then we found the Creperie. I only ate one the entire weekend, but then again I wasn't in Vegas to eat. My girlfriends however.. spent more on crepes than gambling. Good times, good food. I loved the one with the ham and the Bechamel sauce. They have sweet and savory depending on what time of day it is.. ha ha. It doesn't matter what time of day it is, 'cause it is Vegas, and even if you are a stay-at-home mommy with two kids.. you can go to Vegas for a weekend and stay up all night long two nights in a row, partyin' like a RockStar and sustaining yourself on crepes and champagne. Thanks for getting married Nancy!
5 Yums~ I love this place! Despite there being countless restaurants in Vegas, I came back here for a 2nd time before returning home. Both the savory and dessert crepes are delish.
4 Very nice crepes, but to wait in one line to order it, and then have to turn around and wait in another line to pick it up.... it's like a 30 minute wait and way too long for a place that doesn't even have proper chairs and tables for you to eat on...
2 Paris. French Crepes. Good?   Just ok.  Crepevine, a chain in San Francisco, makes better crepes.  I will say the crepe itself, the pancake like dough part is awesome.  But either it had too much sauce or it was too salty.  One tasted like lasagna, the other was just salty with ham or something.  Not eating here again.
4 It is so nice in the hustle and bustle of Vegas to be able to walk up to a counter, pay a relatively inexpensive price (for Vegas standards) for some grub and receive the food within five minutes.  On top of that, these crepes are delish!      What my hubby and I have done is order one salty and one sweet crepe and split them.  I believe they refer to them as meal or dessert crepes...just get one of each.  They are huge but you need to try more than one of these fairly inventive recipes.  I have not made it here on my last two trips to Vegas but Yelp just reminded me to go back and grub.
4 Unless it's a celebrity chef restaurant in Vegas, I typically turn my nose up at these pretentious places like the Le Burger Brasserie (see earlier review) and La Creperie. It's akin to getting Chinese at those Panda Express strip malls.   For $9 apiece,  the crepes are really passable. They do stuff it chockful of fresh ingredients.   Three of us shared the Napolean. The crepe is stuffed with berries and a generous amount of lemon curd and whipped cream are ladled on top of it. A perfect blend of sweet and sour.  We also had the St. Louis, which is ham and fresh basil with bechamel sauce. Not disappointing either.  Yes, if you go when the lines are long, you won't find many places to sit as it's not a restaurant.   Definitely a good snack if you want to save room for dinner. Beats eating junk or McDonald's.  * Photos shot.
2 I've had real crepes in Paris and none have ever been as salty as the one I ate at this place. I had the one with prociutto and boy was it salty. I had to pick out the pieces so I could justify finishing it up. Most of it I threw away because it was making my stomach hurt. I doubt I'll ever give this place a second chance. Two stars.
4 It's surprisingly hard to find a place on the Strip that still serves breakfast after 11 a.m.  Come on, we're in VEGAS!  No one goes to bed before 3 a.m. here!  Do we really have to be up and out of the hotel room by 10 a.m. for a decent breakfast meal?  That's how we ended up at La Creperie.  They actually had a crepe (the "Du Soleil") with veggies, scrambled egg, cheese and bechamel sauce on top.  Not the best crepe I've ever had, but fulfilled the egg requirement and was pretty tasty overall.  There was a fruity one that would have sufficed for breakfast as well, but I needed the protein.  Service was fast and friendly, and prices are better here than most places we found.
3 Wow some of these people must have gone during the weekday when Vegas is not so crowded. B/c our visit here consisted of waiting in a HUGE line to order, waiting till eternity with a crowd of people keeping an ear out for our order numbers and take turns to hunt some seats down while the other person continues to listen out for your order number. I dont' know if one of the cooks called in sick that day but our food took REALLY long. The food...The fiance and I ordered a savory for each of us a shared a sweet crepe. The berry sweet one was waay too sour. It needed something sweeter (other than the whipped cream) to balance it out.  Overall, the crepes were eh...I've had better. I'd say if the line is more than 7 people, skip it.
5 I love their crepes.  For a tourist, this is a great stop for a fast breakfast and lunch.  Dinner is also possible but I wouldn't recommend it.  It's not filling enough.  This is also a great spot for a snack.  You can never go wrong with a crepe.    It's inside the Paris Hotel and Casino.  They have some chairs and tables.  If you have a big group and want to put all the chairs and tables together, be prepared to be using your muscles, if any.  The crepes range from dessert to a gourmet kind.  I've had the Nutella flavored crepe, Berries crepe, and also the omellete.  It's so much better than fast food, even though you get it fast.
4 When everyone's in line at the buffet up the walkway, it'd probably be smarter to actually get your money's worth and come here. Less of a wait (although it's not guaranteed you'll score a table) and more laidback than everyone frantically scrambling for overpriced buffet food, it's kind of made for the Paris hotel. The ham with basil crepe came topped with a good amount of bechamel and was perfect with a smooth cup of coffee. Not exactly Parisien, but definitely better than waiting an hour or more just to gorge yourself.
2 say "au revoir" to this place...don't ask me how to pronounce it.  please excuse my french, but the crepes here are f*cking nasty!!!  seriously, they are on a verge of becoming pancakes.  i wouldn't even give them to my enemies (thanks to the geneva conventions treaties), not that i have any... this is one of those places that falls into "what happens in vegas stays in vegas"!
4 Yay!  I walked from the Mandalay Bay (aka BFE) to Paris, just to eat the crepes New Years morning...the Nutella one had my name written all over it...  A few weekends ago, my cousin who lives in Vegas took me here.. i had a savory crepe then with spinach/mushrooms.. YUMMY!  It's a quick bite... a crepe is around 9 bucks with coffee comes out to 12 bucks...  I'm not into buffets and stuffing my gut until my intestines explode.  No siree, i'd rather not have to be on a goddamn treadmill for 3534343 more hours of my life.  :)
4 This place is super delicious!  I went w/ a friend and we shared one savory and one sweet.  The savory had shrimp, scallops and some bechamel sauce over it.  The sweet was the Napolean which had raspberries, blueberries and strawberries w/ some lemon custard and a delicious raspberry sauce drizzled all over.  Both were amazing and hella tasty.    If you want a get away from the endless buffets in Vegas, you have to try this place.  The only critique I have is that service was very slow, it took them 20+ minutes to get my crepes out.  But regardless, it's worth the wait and just mouthwatering!
5 Ahhh finally a place that makes the best crepes!! We had the banana nutella crepe and the apple crisp crepe. .. Every bite of that crepe was worth gaining that few extra pounds.   I cant even describe how delicious these crepes were, you just gotta go and try it, but beware because they're addicting!!! Damn it, my mouth is watering, I need my crepes!!!
5 Get the Toulouse. C'est tresssssss bon! Then head over to the drink stand across the fake cobblestone street and buy the pina colada in the cheesy Eiffel Tower yard-long bottle and stroll down Le Boulevard. It's so authentic, non?
4 A friend recommended this little crepe place in the heart of the Paris food court, and now I just have to recommend it to you!  If you're lucky, you won't have to wait in line too long, but it's totally worth it.  Have a friend grab a table at the nearby open cafe.  Freshly made crepes, both savory and sweet, are just what a girl needs to keep up her gambling strength.  My favorite is the Fruits de Mer crepe (seafood crepe).  Chunks and chunks of shrimp and scallops wrapped in an air light crepe, with a drizzle of cream sauce on top.  Heavenly.
3 I'm always teetering between good and bad here.  Some trips I get perfectly done crepes, other trips I get some funky ones that make you wonder what you're eating.  It's come to the point that I have to watch them make the crepe and observe each step to ensure I get what i want.  There are times when the crepes get too thick, sometimes too thin.  A lot of the workers there like many in the restaurant industry, believe that more is always better.  that rule does not hold true for savory crepes.  I don't need an overload of sodium to my diet, so you can keep the extra sauce off, and no need for extra seasoning either.  The same goes for sweet tooth's.  Piling on a mountain of whipped cream or berry sauce isn't going to make my taste buds jump w/ joy and I really don't want to frequent my orthodontist often.  When I do happen to get a good crepe, it's heavenly.  I'm not too big on savory crepes, but I'll grab a bite here and there off someone else's if they get it.  Call me a sweet guy, cuz it's always about the berries, or chocolate when it comes to these wonderful desserts.
3 The crepes are average in taste and big in portions.   I usually come here if I happen to be in Paris and hungry but I wouldn't make it a point to check this place out.  I like the dessert crepes the best especially with nutella.
4 Average food but a big plus for speed and price when you have somewhere better to be.  Half the people seated there were speaking French, so it couldn't be all that bad, eh?
4 what a long wait...was it worth it? is anything ever worth the wait? heeeheee..i saved our seat for so long that i actually got up and gave it to the couple standing around with their crepes in tray. i felt so bad that they were just standing and couldn't eat.  get the proscuitto with the cheese and basil! soo delicious!! that's it.
4 Great crepes! They have a very small menu with different types of crepes. My fave is the one with the pears! YUM! Even the spinach one! The Bayonne one (proscuitto, cheese, basil) is one of the most popular ones there. They make it fresh before you. Some lunches can be busy.
4 we waited for about 45 min after ordering... that was the bad part. but it was very very good. we had the sausage thing with the ragu sauce on it.. never had crepe like that before. expensive... but well worth it.
3 Guess we must have found this place right before it closed since it was about 11 pm. It really hit the spot, though, and there was no problem finding a table since it was late. I got La Forestiere, which had spinach, mushrooms, boursin and mozzarella, though I was tempted to get the crepe with ratatouille so I could have been reminded about cartoon cooking mice....  It looked like they covered all the savory crepes in bechamel sauce, which was congealy but tasted kind of good -- it was late, I was hungry.  Sure, it was almost ten bucks, but I probably would have spent just as much on something at one of the cafes, and for those with girly appetites, there was plenty for two people to share.    After all, you don't want to be too full in Vegas...it could slow down your alcohol consumption.
4 Not too bad crepe place in the Paris hotel & casino. I'm not a big fan of the food type crepes but the dessert crepes were pretty good.
3 They only have like 10 crepes. Lame.
3 Food: 3 stars Service: 4 stars (for the cashier) Price: 3.5 stars  We ordered a Napolean crepe which has lemon custard, raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries inside for $8.99. It tasted just ok, not a great crepe place or may be it is just not the type of crepes I like.
4 For unique eateries, you can't go wrong with anything in the Paris hotel. Surprisingly, the wait was fairly short.  I ordered the crepes suzette(oranges aplenty) and my gf ordred the favorite(strawberry and raspberry). Both were very tasty, should satisfy those with a sweet tooth. Keep in mind, if you order something with fruit, use the napkins as you might get hard-to-clean berries on your shirt or skirt, as my gf found out.  They didn't serve full coffee, which I think they should(lattes, mochas, etc.) to complete the crepes experience. My only real complaint is that the seating is limited and shared with the bakery next door. For the value, though, a great meal at roughly 20 bucks for two. A great place for a late breakfast, snack, or dessert!
5 Well- if you want to ingest 9000 calories, and let it be worth it, stop at the Creperie inside Paris. You will not be dissapointed, and I would reccomend you share. We got the Bananas with brandy and nutella and chocolate. Piled with whipped cream, can you say FATTENING?! But they are delightful, and it could be a really romantic little dessert date.
4 Yum. Good, but pricey.
3 This is good.. sort of a Vegas tradition for us now to eat here once per visit.  It's basically just a window, but crepes are not a normal sight, so stop by once, for breakfast, or for dessert.
3 We were recommended to try the Crepe's out here by my hun's parents who raved about it.   We ordered their Seafood Crepe and the Berries Crepe. Both were nice but not anything to "die for" IMHO. I think I've had better or at least "just as good". The line is long but then again, it seems everywhere you go in Vegas has long lines and so it's worth trying.
3 My friend, Deb N., recommended this walk-up window eatery to me while I was sojourning at Bally's. Bally's, for the uninitiated, is linked to the Paris hotel and casino by a charming "pavilion" of shops and eateries.  For the thousands of you who don't know me, my mother is Swedish. From Sweden. This means Swedish pancakes! Swedish pancakes are exactly the same thing as French crepes, but not as "frenchified." So, I'm used to simple presentation and simple fillings.  I was eager to check it out, though. And I couldn't help but branch out (they didn't have a listing for a jelly-filled crepe...) so I ordered the Nutella Crepe. This was the hazelnut paste with a chocolatey goodness layered inside the crepes, while the whole thing was topped off by chocolate sauce, powdered sugar and a dollop of whipped cream.  Background: I had been congested and dreary, sans appetit, for 36 hours. Well, this plate of goodness cheered me right up! Zut alors!!! Sacre bleu!  It was yummy, potentially messy and I ate the whole thing.
3 I'm only giving it 3 stars because I've never tried anything but dessert crepes before. So the "savory" dish on the menu caught my attention. Well, caught my gf's attention since she's the dessert freak.  Tried out the Toulouse which tastes just like a pizza with sausage and mushrooms but it's crepe. A little too much cheese for me. For $8.99, I'd rather just get a real pizza.  If there's a long line then I'd skip it. If you're bored and want to give it a shot then by all means. Just don't expect this thing to fill you up.  I wouldn't come back.
4 These are the best crepes I've ever had. Hopefully my mom in law will change this soon! I had a savory crepe with prosciutto, basil, and that white sauce. the prosciutto was on the salty side but overall it was very yummy. The dough was a nice chewy texture. Also had the Napoleon which had berries, custard and whipped cream. Mmmmm custard in a sweet crepe is a must!  I came here because I remembered in from five years ago and wanted to see if it was still there. Lo and behold, it was in the exact same spot. Warning: long lines in the morning--don't even bother with trying to find good coffee. Also, people are animals about tables...I went to touch a coffee to see if it was still hot --meaning the person was claiming the table...and she came pouncing with a squeaky 'excuse me but thats mine'....well well well....i was just checking, don't freak out or anything! anyways, i was the table holder and set myself down as soon as a party of 8 left. it was a big family. =P  Prices were good for vegas we paid around $45 for 4 crepes. the sign says $8.99 per.
5 mmm.....bananas foster crepe with real sweet whipped cream on top (not that crappy oily mess that so many places serve)  I ate the whole thing by myself....and every bit was delicious!
3 I've always seemed to pass by here as a pit stop at least once every time i go to vegas with family or friends.  The crepes here are very good. I mainly order the dessert ones though.. last time was warm apples with whipped cream.. and the other time with strawberries... I''ve eaten here for lunch before.. and their selections are very few but very healthy and for a good price.  service is very good.. the typical french lunch food.. salads/light pastas/sandwiches..  but I would mainly go here for their crepes.. express window! and hop across the crepery to get an eiffel tower drink :) to walk around with around the strip!
4 I've been meaning to visit this place.  The smell of fresh crepes wafting through the air is quite alluring.  Finally, we made it before noon and ordered dessert crepes for breakfast.  We both ordered the nutella crepe, which includes chocolate sauce and chantilly (a.k.a. whipped cream).  It was too much for either of us to finish for breakfast, so I think a crepe for breakfast could easily be shared.  They also offered several bottled beverages and hot, fresh beverages.  I enjoyed a Starbucks frappucino (coffee flavored) with my crepe, and it was a nice touch.  But then I needed water, after all that sweetness!  Anyway, I'm definitely coming back here to try a savoury crepe on my next trip to Las Vegas!
5 Super yummy!!!!  I haven't had a nutella crepe since we were in Paris, France!  mmmm mmmm mmmm.  My husband and I shared both the sausage/mushroom crepe and the nutella crepe.  They were both really good.  Sure, the savory one was just like pizza, but it was really good!  You seriously cannot go wrong with nutella, so I have no complaints at all!  yummy yummy yummy!
5 These may be the best crepes I've ever had. I use the crepes here to compare to other crepe places.   They are worth the price!  The sauce is excellent, and high quality..and so is the fruit.  Whipped cream is good.. The crepe itself is nice..Thick and good.  The crepes at the buffet aren't as big, but they're all you can eat... awesome!
4 The last few times I've been to Vegas, I did not get to eat a crepe from Vegas. So I just had to stop here to fulfill my craving instead of any other crepe place.   The lines can be a bit long, but moves at a fast pace. The cooks are amazing, at the time I went there was only one person working it and he was whipping up crepes at a blur. The quality of these crepes are amazing, with the actually crepe a light egg flavor, and always flavorful, fresh ingredients you can see. Sweet or Savory it is hard to make up my mind.   I went with the savory crepe Toulouse, which has sausage, mushroom and pepperoni in it, topped with marinara sauce. Delicious, and just hit the spot.
3 I'm not a fan of the savory crepes here, but the pear one is to die for.  Yum!  If I wasn't already on the verge of morbid obesity, I'd eat one every hour every time I was in Vegas!
4 When in Paris, do as Parisians do.  When in Paris Las Vegas, stop by La Creperie.    I come here a few times a year for a quick, casual breakfast.  Notice I didn't say "cheap," because that's one thing it is NOT.  $8.99 a crepe is a lot of money.  I guess they have to pay for their charming location on Le Boulevard inside Le Casino.  La Creperie only offers food for takeout, although there's a charming seating area to the left of the stand.  Go with a friend and have him or her save you a seat.  The seating area is pretty small, and you might have to get creative about getting a table.  The crepes are made to order, so get ready to wait 4-5 minutes for your order.  Since I have to order two of everything, I opted for two crepes: one breakfast crepe and one dessert crepe  They offer 6 breakfast crepe choices and 6 dessert crepe choices.  I went with a St. Louis crepe (pronounced "sen-loo-WEE," like the Tampa Bay Lightning player, not like the city in Missouri) and a Peanut crepe (no pronunciation tips necessary).    The St. Louis had prosciutto, cheese, basil and was drenched in bechamel sauce.  The sauce was thick, but a bit mealy.  Actually, now that I think about it, it looked pretty disgusting, kind of like milky cream of wheat.  The crepe was very tasty and filling, though.  The second crepe, the Peanut was chock full of chunky peanut butter and bananas.  I would have called it The Elvis (in loving memory).  The Peanut was very sweet, but it still made for a pretty good dessert.  It's not the best dessert crepe out there, though.  Berry and fruit crepes are much better.  Piece of advice: skip the coffee.  It's too weak and taste-less.  I saw people walking around with Starbucks cups.  If I hadn't been so lazy, I would have stopped by a Starbucks before ordering my crepes.  Starbucks is not very Paris like, but . . . you know how they say that Seattle is the Paris of the Pacific Northwest?  Well, they don't really say it, but they could.
1 Ok so I have eaten many crepes in my life being born in Paris and all. So I wasn't expecting much from this place. But my oh my how much below par this place was. I ordered the St. Louise and the bf got the Fruits de la mer. Both of our crepes took over 10 mins to make, and when we got it they were both semi cold...mildly warm in the middle. My crepe was drenched in the bechamel sauce which had like no taste. The actual crepe itself was very flour-ie tasting. The deli ham and cheese helped the food go down. My bf did not enjoy his crepe one bit...what a dissapointment. Also savory crepe should never be the same price as dessert crepes (8.99). Stay away.
3 Fast, delicous, and a nice ending to a great day!
3 I used to love coming here when the prices were cheaper. I remember I was in Las Vegas one weekend and they were one price then came back the next the prices went up 2 dollars!!! That is ridiculous. I haven't been since.   My favorite savory crepe was one with seafood in a creamy white sauce. My favorite dessert one came with Nutella and I always added bananas. I don't think people know that you could customize your order.  I would of suggested this place when it was cheaper. Not sure if it's worth the two dollar raise in prices. Also, since it is just a window front, you have to look for your own table. That area is by the bathroom and it's always pack. So I don't think it's worth the effort paying the price you do and then having to stand around waiting for a table and most likely having to bus it yourself. The way they serve the crepes is on a plate and you definitely need a fork and knife. You can't just pick it up and go and eat it like an ice cream. Someone needs to open up a crepe place just like it, fix all the problems and I know they would make a killing.
4 This was my first crepe ever, so I dont have much crepe experience. But i can pick out some faults...  The boyfriend and I came here this past weekend, and were delightfully satisfied.  I ordered the D'Anjou. Which is a sweet crepe, with Almond Paste, Pears, and walnuts, topped with caramel sauce. Now, when they say "topped with a caramel sauce" they actually mean: "3 skinny lines of caramel, carelessly scattered across your plate and crepe"  It was delicious though. The pears were canned, which at first, i was against, but then as i was eating it, i came the the conclusion that they were perfect because fresh pears would've been too hard. these still had a nice bite to them though, they weren't soggy. The almond paste gave a sweet, smooth, nutty blanket in the background.. it wasn't over powering with almond flavor.  The boyfriend ordered The Favorite. which was also a sweet crepe, stuffed with all types of berries (blueberries and strawberries come to mind, but i know there were more) topped with a berry sauce. It was very tangy, which complimented the sweet crepe perfectly.  The down side to this place, is the line. You order, and then spend 15-20 mins (depending on how big the line is.. more or less.) standing off to the side, waiting for your number to be called. Oh, and bottled water is $4 (for the small bottle) and $5 (for the bigger bottle.)   The crepes are about $9... so for both our crepes, and 2 waters, the total came to $30. Was it worth $30? No. Not at all. But that's Vegas... you're mostly paying for where you're eating, secondary is WHAT you're eating.
2 This place is okay. Nothing special and I've had better before.  But, when you're stumbling around drunk and you're hungry (and perhaps feeling not so rich after gambling), this isn't a bad place to go. You'll get a decent sized crepe and can sit in a fake Paris ambiance. It's weird that you have to go to the restaurant next door to get water/utensils.
4 the section connecting paris and bally's is always really awesome looking [though the miniature/ scaled down reproductions of the villages almost makes me feel like an oompaloompa is going to jump out somewhere...] but this little kiosk happens to have some delicious offerings.  i generally would have opted for a sweet crepe, but since i hadn't had lunch yet, i decided to go with the toulouse crepe [italian sausage, mushrooms, cheese, marinara, etc.] and it was fabulous.  boyfriend felt like the crepe shell was too 'eggy' but i liked mine.  it was priced a little bit above the average, but hey, what's not overpriced in vegas??!!
3 Face it, do you really go to Vegas to get a crepe? I didn't think so. You're probably like me and Jamie. You're probably staying at the Paris Las Vegas on a weekend discount package. You just saw Cher at Caesar's Palace and was wondering how a 63-year-old woman can have the body fat of a ten-year-old on a weight-gain program. As you come to realize you should go to bed with that question weighing heavily on your mind, you respond to a moment of weakness and come here.   It's open late, well late for me, not for Vegas. 11PM. It's fairly quiet at this hour with the faux-Paris hallway with only a smattering of drunken tourists. The main dining room is closed, so you just walk up to the kiosk and order. Jamie and I split a $8.99 "Favorite" which was all sort of berries hidden under a large folded crepe. Lot of whipped cream, powdered sugar and berry puree oozing all over it (see my photo). In other words, it hit the spot. We sat in the dining area adjacent to the place and were perfectly content to discuss whether Cher has ever ordered one of these.   CREPE - 3.5 stars...no great culinary art but it does satisfy a late-night sweet tooth  AMBIANCE - 3 stars...well, it's Paris...sorta  SERVICE - 3 stars...they're pretty much on autopilot at this hour so don't expect frills  TOTAL - 3 stars...so I was hungry at 11PM...so what?
3 We had heard about the crepes at this place from many of our friends.  We didn't know where it was, so we asked the gentleman working behind the Players Club Desk "where are the crepes?"  Not only did he give us directions to the location, he gave us an "Insider Tip" card - personal handwritten coupon for us (buy a crepe, get a free coffee or drink).  Sure you think, free drink, no big deal.  Well, at $2.99 a drink, we were appreciative of the insider tip card!  I have had crepes before - the best being in Vancouver, BC.  But here, in the end, the crepes were ok.  We got one of the salty ones -  the size was enough for 2 people.  I think they were unable to keep up with the volume of orders b/c the veggie filling inside was cold.  Don't expect mindblowing crepes, but do go for the ambiance of "Paris" or as a buffet alternative.
3 Crepes in the Paris. NAWWWWWW!!! SHOCKER!  Me and 7 of my girlfriends stopped by La Creperie on the recommendation of one of our group. Usually I like as little fuss as possible with my crepes, so I was a little disappointed not to see a plain old butter and sugar on there, though I also didn't ask if they would make one to try it out. Not even a crepe suzette! I had the D'Anjou - a pear, almond paste, caramel, whipped cream and walnut concoction  The pears were so-so and mixed with the paste, produced a not super flavorful milky juice that kinda grossed me out and the whipped cream was a bit "cool whip" tasting. I did manage to make it almost all the way through, however because the crepe itself was delicious.  My friend had the seafood crepe, which I got to when it was a little cold. It was buttery and I imagine very good warm, but the bechamel sauce on the top was a little floury.   I'd go again, but I'd order butter and sugar or strawberries.
4 La Creperie can be found within the majestic walls of the Paris Hotel. After a stellar night out on the town, my 7 girlfriends and I decided to go here since we were starving and our early morning bloody marys were beginning to take effect.   I decided to try the Seafood crepe - scallops and shrimp and drizzled with bechemal sauce. Delicious!!! It's pretty inexpensive for being Vegas and the best part: you get your choice of dessert or savory. Plus there's the bar across the way :) Go big or go home in Vegas, right?  Cheers!
2 La Creperie only reinforces why I never try crepes at touristy attractions. Although they have both dessert crepes and savory ones, I always try the dessert. We ordered the Favorite, which was filled with raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries topped with raspberry coulis (another fancy name for raspberry sauce). The crepe was a little soggy and too thick for my liking. The raspberry sauce was too tangy I had to counteract it with whipped cream. I've had good raspberry sauce and a little tang is good, but this was too much. But maybe you'll have a better experience with a different crepe and maybe I would have given you a better review La Creperie if you had a better raspberry sauce and I didn't have to wait 40 minutes to be disappointed.
3 Had the late night munchies and needed some fuel before going out to par-tay. Thank goodness we walked into Paris Hotel because there was "fast food" other then McD's or Panda Express(I can't believe there's one in Vegas). It was quick and easy. Just go up to the window, order, grab food and find seat. Then proceed to eat.Got the Fruits de Mare and it had a generous portion of scallops, shrimps and mushrooms for $8. I've had my share of crepes and this was pretty good for the take-out-late-night-snack field.
4 I don't know why this place gets a bad review, I think they have ginormous crepes (for a Vegas price, of course), and the crepes are delicious and have tons of filling in them. Although I've only had the sweet kind, I can't say that I've found a crepe place that tastes bad enough for 2 or even 3 stars.  Location is a little questionable next to the bathrooms and finding a seat sometimes can be difficult, but the service has always been prompt and relatively friendly (as friendly as Vegas gets).  My favorite crepes are the banana ones :)
4 Great quick food for Paris or Bally's.  Desert or savory crepes filling enough for a quick breakfast or a light lunch.  My favorite is the St Louis which is ham, creamy cheese, and a touch of fresh basil.  My GF loves the chocolate crepe if you have a sweet tooth.  Seating can be tough to find if it's a weekend, but they give you free re-fills on the coffee, and the service is about as fast as you can get for a quick bite in Vegas.
5 Best crepe's I have ever had.  I know that's not saying much to you because you don't know me but to me that's saying enough :P  We almost always stay in Paris or Ballys because of free rooms, and this always leads us to spend our hangover down in Paris.  Walla.  Crepes.  The line is always long but you can get some red beer or a bloody mary across the way to help you with your hangover.  They have breakfast crepes that have like eggs and bacon etc. in them (numerous varieties) or they have sweet crepes that are filled with fruit concoctions.  I hate deciding because I love sweet things more but know that the other stuff is better for me. They have scallop crepes and vegetarian crepes, you name it.  The crepes are huge, filled well and I've never been with anyone in our party who was disappointed.  Good stuff.
4 Yum, I love crepes and yes sometimes the line can be long. We got the special crepe (filled with strawberries, and blueberries). It was very good and we came when they weren't too busy. The seating was nice too, crepe in paris! It's pretty hard to mess up a crepe.
5 FYI:  I am not reviewing the coffee, the price tag, or anything else on this review.  I consider them all worthy of being considered as criteria on the five star scale, but some food items are so tasty as to render all flaws meaningless.  Enter the peanut butter crepe.  Ordinarily when I go to Le Creperie I order the nutella crepe.  Chocolate hazelnut goo inside a thin, chewy, magical crepe and buried under a mountain of whipped cream.  But this day I saw on the menu a different crepe.  My wandering eyes betrayed the nutella and settled on "banana" and "peanut butter" and saw no alternative.  Thank you, wandering eyes.  If you could distill Beethoven's fifth symphony into a dessert, this crepe is what you'd get.  Ripe bananas bursting with sugar.  Peanutty, not-sweet peanut butter for contrast, and then a pound of whipped cream and carmel sauce all accompanied by a crepe make for one of the best desserts I've ever had.  Yes, you need to take your keys to your car, put them in the ignition, and drive straight to LV to get this crepe.
5 Damn it all to hell! If Richard Z or Dallas G beat me to one more review I am going to hurl myself from atop the Luxor obelisk, which by the way, Richard can't tell if it is here nor there. But I digress.   I was introduced to this little crepe place oh so many years ago by either Dallas or Richard and have been in love ever since. My staple was the Normandy, warm apples, caramel, and the ton of whipped cream everyone talks about. I was happy with this, content you could say. I have strayed in the past, trying a savory as opposed to sweet crepe, but it just wasn't the same.   This most recent trip to Sin City I was messaged by Mr Z and told about a new delectable crepe being offered: The Peanut Butter and Banana crepe. Anyone who knows me, knows my love affair with peanut butter is a long and satisfying one. Bananas are a new love and I recently discovered that the two combined are an unstoppable force.  Throw in a thin, chewy crepe, and some of the whipped cream and you have yourself... well just look at the picture.  The line for this place can seem like an eternity, but the people watching is entertaining.  Any trip to Vegas seems incomplete when we are just unable to fit Le Creperie into the mix.
5 When four women (that just happen to be nymphomaniacs) sit around a table and agree that the peanut crepe is better than sex, you are doing something right.
5 By far THE BEST crepé's I have ever had. I remember, before leaving Las Vegas, a girlfriend of mine insisted we make a stop over at the Paris for brunch and I'm forever grateful for her introducing La Creperié to me.  I had the D'Anjou - a pear,  with caramel, almond paste, whipped cream and walnus. Pretty much a heaven treat in your mouth, chased by some refreshing, Organina.   They have plethora of choices to choose from though to lure anyones taste buds in. Shrimp and hollandaise sauce, Nutella and almonds, etc. You won't be disappointed.
4 What does an early-bird bahelorette do when she's been up since 7am and is patiently waitng for the girls to get ready? Food run. We were stayin at Paris, and having only had a few hours off my feet after strutting around Vegas in 4.5 inchers til 4 - I wanted close and quick.  I ordered the Forestiere and added meat - it was good. The bechamel was better the other day than this morning. I also ordered the Du Soliel and the Berry one. I advise you to go when no one is in line - our crepes came out crisp and were filling and delicious.
5 Berry crepe was sweet goodness.  I ate the whole thing all by myself.  Need I say more?
3 Cheap? No. MASSIVE? Yes. Worth the moderately annoying line? For sure.  But stick to the dessert crepes. My 'savory' crepe was less than thrilling. That Napoleon (lemon custard, berries, cream) was outta this world.   Also, an iced coffee with Baileys is an EXCELLENT jumpstart to a day of gambling, in my professional opinion.
4 the crepes are HUGE! they aren't that cheap, but crepes everywhere aren't that cheap anyways. we got a spinach and mozzerella one (i forgot the name) and then for dessert, we got a strawberry one (again, i forgot the name). two crepes between 3 girls. we were super stuffed afterwards. halfway through, we were already full, but it was so good that we had to keep going! i would definitely some back here the next time we're in vegas!
5 When in a rush and just wnat good food at a cheap (for Vegas) price, this is the place. It is behind the Casino in the Paris and has many different crepe options. Whether in the mood for sweet or savory, this place has you covered.  I got the savory crepe with prosciutto and it was delicious. The prosciutto was salty, but htat's the way I like it. It was ready in about 10 minutes and we were back at the tables within 25 minutes of ordering.  There is a cafeteria style area to eat right next door and is a good area for people watching.
5 Do you like crepes? If so look no further...these are sumptuous! We tried the Suzette which is orange segments, cointreau, brown sugar, butter and lemon juice...mmmm.......and the Napoleon which is lemon custard with raspberries, blueberries and strawberries....wow! Accompany that with the Irish Coffee and it is an almost spiritual experience. They make the crepes right in front of you and you are given them to go. You can take them back to your room or you can enjoy them right there. Highly recommend!
3 I came here with my friends to grab a late breakfast/lunch.  I ate here maybe five years ago, and I remembered it was pretty good.  You place your order at the window, and you can go grab a table while you wait for your crepe to be made.  It usually takes about five minutes or so, depending on how busy they are.  I went with the Fruits de Mer( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/z1163PZ9voGYg4HawDXrkw/l ) which had shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, Swiss cheese and Bechamel sauce.  It tasted like the seafood was frozen, and the Bechamel sauce didn't have much flavor.  I had a bite of my friend's Toulouse, which had a marinara sauce, and that was much tastier.    I also got a cup of coffee here, and after a while, I noticed my cup was slowly leaking from the bottom.  They were nice enough to give me a fresh cup of coffee, which I then burned my tongue on.  =P  If you come here, go for the dessert crepes or the Toulouse.  I'm not a fan of their Bechamel sauce, but the other stuff is good!
4 C-R-E-P-E-S!!   One of my favorite places to go eat in Vegas is here!  I love crepes and this place satisfies my cravings.   When in need for good food quick, come here (only during the non rush hours and non-holidays week).  They don't have an actual restaurant.  La Creperie is a food stand that has a large kitchen.   It is located in Paris.  You order the food at the cashier and just wait for your number to be called.    My favorite crepes:  St. Louis ( prosciutto, cheese, basil with bechamel sauce) and the Napoleon (Lemon Custard with Raspberries, Blueberries, and Strawberries).  We also ordered one that had salsa on top, but I can't remember the name.  It was also really good.  Good crepe:  Toulouse.  It taste like a Calazone.   All the crepes cost about $8-10.  The portions are HUGE.  My 3 sisters and I shared 3 crepes.  It was very very filling!   Cons:  When you go during a holiday week, expect the wait to be LONG.  We went during Christmas week and it literally took us about 40 mins just to order and get the food.   However, when I ate here during a non-holiday week, I got the food instantly (10 mins).  Also, there is a seating area right next to the stand, but finding a table and chairs is INSANE!! Honestly, it's like a whole new world... you see the ugliest side of a person.  There's so much tension and hostility when people are looking for a table and chair.  My family was lucky enough to find a table but just trying to get one more chair took 20 minutes.  Also, while you're eating, you can feel and see people lurking at your table and ready to grab your table once you are done.  It's like a jungle.  *Survival of the Fittest!*  However, please remember that I went here during Christmas week.  Overall, I totally recommend this place!
4 I f-ing love this place.  It's where we had breakfast , well, three of the three mornings we were in Vegas.   I prefer savory to sweet crepes, unless they're just buttered and sugared....  I'm a less is more kind of a gal.   This place is truly top notch in my book!  They're huge and well, maybe it's 'cause I'm from downtown Chicago... but I don't find $9.99 for a crepe than can feed two to be at all over priced.
4 $10 is a reasonable price for a crepe especially in Vegas. What I did not expect was how big of a crepe I would get. It more than justified the price and left me utterly too full in a I should not have finished it but it was really good kind of way. The Foresterie was filled with spinach and mushrooms. Gigantic! I tell you. Le Creperie a great place for a good no frills bite to eat.
4 This place is a must whenever you want a cheap and delicious cure to your hangover! Or if you just want to satiate your hunger!  There is always a line here! But it is well worth the wait!   Toulouse includes cheese, sausage, and mushrooms enfolded inside thin, waif-like crepe skin. It is topped with red sauce. This tastes like a light lasagna. But way better!  Fruits de Mer- a seafood crepe topped with bechamel sauce! I actually prefer this one over my Toulouse! They are not cheap with their seafood! every bite is guaranteed a piece of shrimp or scallop!   Right across from this little stand is a bar, go ahead and order a Paris souvenir drink while you're waiting. Or you can even grab a delicacy from a bakery since there are little "French" bakeries lined up along the walkway La Creperie is located at.
4 So the crepes at this place was good and the price wasn't over the top. I got the Toulous crepe with pepperoni, sausage, cheese, mushrooms, with tomato sauce. It was a hearty meal for the price I paid for it. The service was quick.  Every time I'd walk pass this place, I would always see a mass amount of people huddling over this little place. Now I can see why.   If you're on a budget in Vegas, I suggest coming here for your meals, but if you're not, then there's plenty of things to indulge on the Strip.
4 I loved the Nutella crepe here for being the perfect thickness, being perfectly delicious with just the right amount of Nutella, and being absolutely fresh and quick and tasty!   Agreed, $10 seems steep for a crepe, but trust me, these crepes are more than a full meal! I couldn't even finish just a dessert crepe on my own and it was my first meal of the day at 5pm!
5 this is THE place to get crepes in Las Vegas. i wont write alot, it's already been said, but for the first timer, try the Favorite Dessert Crepe (mixed berries whipped cream), and the Fruits De La Mer Savory Crepe (shrimp, scallops, cheese).    DO NOT buy bottled water here.  for a 1.5L Aquafina, i was charged $4.75.  broke my heart, but i couldn't say never mind, as there were many people behind me, and i didn't want to appear cheap. it will not happen again!
5 I have been to the creperie countless times because of the Delicious Crepes! I typically get the St Louis crepe, but I'll change it up and get the chocolate crepe too! They give you a lot for a tiny price!
4 I *heart* crepes. La Creperie is a MUST for me in Vegas. Depending on the time of day, you might encounter an unfortunately long line.... and my only annoyance with this place is that they are painfully slow when they get busy. But the crepes are so delicious and the chantilly whipped cream that comes with the dessert crepes is to die for. The Napoleon crepe is amazing.... the lemon custard and the berries are so perfect together.   If you can help it, try to buy your beverages elsewhere.... they are just a little crepe stand and therefore they charge you an arm and a leg for bottled water/pop.
2 Note to self: NEVER order the seafood here. EVER. (One more time for effect.) EVER.   It's not fresh, smells fishy, and is gross.  The boy ordered your regular dessert-style crepe, and he said it was alright............... Maybe the next time I find myself in the Paris, I'll give it another shot.
4 This place is TOTALLY worth the $10.  You get a decent list of sweet and savory crepes, all for the same price.  I got the Favorite, which is the trio of berries drizzled in raspberry sauce, with whip cream.  They give a GENEROUS serving of berries inside the crepe.  I thought the syrup was a bit on the sour side, so I had to eat a lot of the whipped cream with it to balance out the sourness.  I would totally come here again and try all the different dessert ones!!!!
4 Ever since I have known him, my die-hard crepe fanatic bf has raved about the crepes from La Creperie. He swears they are the best in the world.   He was certainly right about them being delicious. Maybe it's the batter or simply the way they cook the batter. Maybe it's the combination of fillings. Whatever it is, they should stick to it.   I ordered one of the savory crepes, the Toulous. It was filled with ground sausage, mushrooms, cheese, and more. It was topped with marinara sauce (yum!). He ordered a dessert crepe, the Napoleon. It was filled with lemon custard and fruits, topped with cream and sugar. Both were good, but his was far better than mine.   The wait was about 20 mins per order and each crepe was about $10. It's definitely something you should try while you are in Vegas. I recommend that you stick to the dessert crepes if you do decide to stop by! :)
2 The only positive thing I can say is that this place is one of the less expensive options for breakfast. I ordered the Napoleon and I could have made a better crepe myself - and I'm not even a good cook! It was made with frozen berries that tasted like rubber. Will not be coming back here. Le Village Buffet right across from La Creperie must have a long line for a reason.
5 I don't know anyone who doesn't like crepes, and La Creperie in Paris does them perfectly.  Sometimes you need a lighter side to vegas than the heffer status buffets or the man size steaks in every hotel.  What I like about La Creperie is the simplicity of it all.  You order, they make, they serve on a paper plate.  Nothing fancy about it.  My boyfriend and I shared the fruits de mer and favorite crepe.  The fruits de mer has succulunt shrimp and bay scallops covered in a "lightish" bechamel sauce (as light as bechamel can be).  The favorite crepe comes with a variety of berries along with a massive dollop of fresh whipped cream and powdered sugar.  It seriously comfort food done well.  We always come here on our trips to Vegas usually the day we're leaving, trying to minimize anymore gluttony we've experienced throughout our trip.
4 One of my favorite places to go for breakfast in vegas. Its open all day so you can go anytime of the day to get crepes and I like that it has both dessert and savory crepe options. Each is about $10 and they are very generous with the crepe filling and toppings. I usually get their savory crepes and they never disappoint. The ingredients are very fresh and I like that they don't make the crepe until you order so you know the crepe is also made fresh. The service is very fast and it is a very large crepe. They also have juices and coffee, everything you need for a quick brunch or bite to start off your day. Its not a formal restaurant so the only tricky thing is that it doesn't have formal seating. It shares the seating area with other eating places around the area so once in awhile it might be hard to find a seat but the few times I've been there I've never had a problem. I've gotten the mozzarella and prosciutto crepe, the shrimp and scallop crepe as well as the banana foster's crepe (the only dessert one I've tried) and they've all been good. I highly recommend this place!
3 I tried the dessert crepe with fruit and lemon curd at La Creperie and it was a pretty average crepe. There wasn't much special about it and the berries weren't very sweet or fresh. And the service took a LONG time for just a simple berry crepe. They also mounded half of my plate with really heavy whipped cream, and although I'm biased because I only like whipped cream from starbucks, it was just bad whipped cream in general. The only good thing about this creperie is that for about $10, the huge crepe will fill you up, whether you get the dessert or savory crepe because they're both the same price there.
4 I am a chocolate freak & LOVE CREPES! Usually, I try to avoid LV strip because of the traffics on the road (especially during the holiday weekends-.-;;;).  But I've been craving for good crepes for a while, this time I had to go & eat it no matter what. I was driving to Paris HTL &  it was on July 4th wknd, haha!  There I was ordering "Nutella".. Soooo Tasty!!!  A great amount of warm chocolate hazelnut melted down on the plate, finished with whipping cream & powder sugar, Amazing Amazing!,   I was very satisfied.
4 Delicious and not too overpriced.
4 It's a little kiosk almost, in the Paris Hotel. Small, but they churned out some delicious crepes. Sweet and savory crepes are both $9.99. I had the fruits de mer for breakfast. Yes, shrimp, mushrooms, and scallops with mozzarella (light) and some sauce for breakfast. It was delicious and they were generous with their seafood. I ate half and was sufficiently full. I wished I could have come for dessert though their generosity made the sweet crepes look too intense even for my sweet tooth.
3 I wish I can give you a honest review on this place, but because I was still feeling a bit "hungover" from the night, I don't think we made the right decision to eat here.  I did like the prices and the size of the crepes. However, the variety is lacking.   I think I had the one with the shrimp and mushroom. I had more mushroom than shrimp, but I'm a mushroom kind of gal so I wasn't complaining. I wish they put more basil on it, cause I was excited about that, but if you're looking at the pictures, it's a little CLUMP of basil.  Damnit, why couldn't you put it in the crepe! IT'D MAKE IT TEN TIMES BETTER!
5 Delicious crepes! I always get the ones with berries and am never disappointed. Way better than the crepe I had last night at Jean Phillipe's Pattiserie at Aria.
4 Giant crepes! Giant crepes! Even with a small menu to choose from, I still had a tough time deciding on which sweet or savory crepe I'd devour.  Cost - For the crepe I would consider it fair, especially in Vegas. However, the price of coffee was stupid. $4 for a coffee is a bit much and it gets closer to $10 if you add a shot of something to it. Yikes.  I chose a sweet and my wife chose savory. We were both happy with our selections.   The biggest downside to ordering from here during breakfast hours is a lack of somewhere to sit. La Creperie is right next to another food stop (and across from a buffet) and seating can become a bit of an issue.   But based purely on food taste, amount for dollars and service - I think it's pretty good eats. Check it out if you're looking for something a little different and delicious.
4 Soooooooooooooo good! Cheeeeeeeeeessssse...don't know what else to say 'cept this hit the spot when I was staying at The Paris and it was a bargain for the size compared to some meals in sin city. Vege options of course ; )
4 This is a quick spot for breakfast and very good. A litle overpriced, $9.99 for a crepe and $3.50 for a regular coffee!! However, the crepes were freshly made and delicious. I had a ham crepe with bechamel sauce which was very tasty and my man had something that resembled pizza, a sausage and mushroom stuffed crepe covered in marinara sauce. We went back another day and he had the the seafood crepe which was filled with shrimp. Both were very good.
4 Mmmm giant, enormous, bundles of crepes! I'm sad because the price of one individual crepe sky rocketed to $9.99 each compared to back then, they were like $7.99 :( I know, not a big difference, but two dollars can change a life you know.. ANYWAYS I can't believe that this place is hidden inside none other than Paris. It's right across from that long ass line for the buffet, but why wait when you could conveniently get it to go right? There are some ups and downs to the crepes though. I haven't tried all of it, but if you like something that tastes like potpourri, then get "The Favorite" which is I think #1 on the menu. It's a combination of random fruits which over powers the crepe itself. I honestly don't like it :( If you want something as a dessert, I suggest you get either the Nutella, Chocolate or Suzette. I know for sure that those are yummy, but I have yet to try the others, so if you want to be adventurous and try something else, then hell, go for it! :) My last comment for the evening is.. the Fruits De Mer, also shortly and casually known as "Seafood Crepe" -___-. It's awesome for seafood lovers though! It has scallops, mushrooms, shrimp, and mozarella. Doesn't sound good but it is! Nom nom nom
5 Long wait but worth it. We had an Italian crepe and a mix berry and they were both great! Good prices for vegas strip too.
3 Big crepes that are priced for the strip.
5 Huge delicous crepes good price
4 One of the best places to eat in Paris Hotel. I love their savory crepes!!
3 The best crepes in Vegas? Not saying much perhaps. But our group was starving and hungover so why not.  The crepes are heavy and filling. Overall, I enjoyed mine but the prosciutto was a bit much and salty for my liking. The bechamel sauce is creamy. Perhaps sharing is the best route.  Love that they have Orangina.
4 Being in San Diego, I don't really get that many opportunities to get good crepes so I always make an effort to stop by this place whenever I go to Las Vegas.  Crepes in Paris?  Seems idealistic, right?  The crepes here are a bit pricey but are well worth the money.  I usually come here after getting some sort of alcoholic drink served in a big plastic Eiffel Tower.  I've tried the Nutella crepe and the peanut butter crepe.  Both of which I consider are EXCELLENT.  The Nutella has a nice flavor to it.  The Nutella compliments the warm crepe will.  Top it off with whipped cream and this one is a winner.    The peanut butter crepe is probably my favorite of them all.  It's filled with peanut butter and banana.  The creaminess of the peanut butter coupled with the warm crepe makes for an excellent dessert.  It's definitely one of my favorite guilty pleasures when coming to Vegas.
4 Crepes... Nutella crepes! Situated in cute little Paris casino.   I like how it's grab-n-go style... So you can sit and eat it in the neighboring sit down area, or walk and eat.   The crepes are all made fresh to order. This particular crepe was slathered in Nutella, dolloped with a generous amount of crème fraîche, and made me a happy girl.   There's no room for disappointment here!
4 From my first bite on my very first trip to the Paris Hotel, I have been a fan.  The crepes are yummy. Sweet ones, savory ones, they are all delicious.  They are pretty big too, I like to split one with someone.    The service is not the best. This last time I was there, the woman taking my order hardly looked at me.  I could barely hear her, and since she wasn't looking at me, I couldn't tell if she was talking to me or the woman behind her making the crepe.  Whatever frustration I was feeling from the service, all went away when I took my crepe to a little table to enjoy (with my $4 bottle of water).    The good part is since you order your crepe from the little window, you are only dealing with the mediocre service for just a few minutes.  Then, you are left to enjoy the mouth-watering crepe.  YUM!
4 We have to get crepes from La Creperie every time we're in Vegas. Ahhh, how delicious they are. It seems the price goes up annually, but 1 crepe is enough for a meal. The most difficult thing is to choose what kind to have. The savory crepes are just as delicious as the sweet ones. This is a fairly inexpensive way to eat in Vegas, and since it's a casual seat-yourself setting, good for kids and a quick meal without having to pay tips or wait to be served. Did I mention these crepes are absurdly delicious?! My favorite - the Napoleon; lemon custard with berries. Now I'm hungry...
4 The crepe made by order, so it was fresh, but the crepe was a little bit dried.
4 Bananas Foster will satisfy your sweet tooth without the soggy mess of mixed berry 'Favorite'.  Large portion sizes make this a great dessert for 2-3 friends.
4 Solid savory crepes (sorry, I typically find sweet crepes, err, too sweet), with good flavor, great choices, and good portion size, too.  Price is just ok, but at least they take credit card. Negatives are pretty minor - seating is limited, and preparation doesn't seem to be very efficient, so be prepared to wait a while for your food.
4 We went to Paris to hit up the Le Buffet for the crepes but the line was about a mile long. Luckily there was La Creperie located exactly across from the buffet. The price of $10 per crepe will at first shock you, but then you have to realize 3 things ... 1. this is Vegas; 2. the crepes are HUGE; and, 3. the crepes are delicious!!! My hubby and I ordered one savory and one sweet crepe and decided to split them. For the savory we got the (forge the formal name of it) cheese and prosciutto crepe. I had never had a savory crepe before, just sweet ones in the real Paris. The crepes are a bit thicker than the real things but they are very very flavorful. After taking my first bite of the savory crepe, I couldn't believe I went this long in life without having one before. All I can say is .... OMG Yum!!!! This is not a crepe I would recommend trying to eat on your own. It is to be shared. It is huge and very very filling. The next was the sweet crepe. We were already full but there was no way I was going to let this go to waste. We ordered the crepe with cinnamon apple filling, topped with caramel and creme. And, when I say creme I mean to say C-R-E-M-E. It's a wallop of real whipped cream; maybe a bit too much. It also melts quickly so be sure to not order it at the same time as the savory crepe. Next time we'll get up and order it separately. Anyway, back to the crepe. Again, yummy goodness! I had never had a crepe with apples before. It was like apple pie hooked up with a Frenchman. Perfection! Even though we were stuffed, we licked our plate clean. This is a definite must-visit when stopping at Paris Las Vegas. I look forward to it in the future.  Add'l notes .... seating is a problem. This is not a restaurant. Seating is available next door to the crepe stand but on a busy day, it can be tough to find seating. Have one person stalk out a table while the other is in line getting the crepes. While the crepes run $10 a pop, soda is about $4 and it's for a small ... very small ... 16oz cup. The drink prices are not posted on the menu so it's a bit of a shock when they ring it up and you'll be too stunned to say anything. There is no kids menu so when a child orders a crepe, they'll be getting the same size as an adult. Be sure to share!
4 I LOVE this place!!!  This will be my 3rd or fourth time to this yummy creperie place.   What makes it special is the quality and yumminess of the crepe itself and the creme they put on top. Its addicting! Seriously! Plus the fact that they do NOT use canned ingredients for the fruits and veggies.   The best selections are the dessert crepes - they use real fruits which is beneficial because they do not soak through the fluffy crepe batter. I had the "Favorite" which consists of fresh berries and cream...so good!   The nutella with strawberries and bananas is also yummy,   The Toulous is good for marinara lovers, while the Spinach Cheese Mushroom is also really good.   Their crepes are quite sizeable as well!   For coffee lovers, this place is quality.  They offer smooth and well-flavored quality coffee.  The only bummer is the slow service - it's a walk up window and there's almost always a line, whether weekday or weekend. I've tried both and stood in a line no matter what. (mind you this is around the holidays).
2 I guess that this being Vegas, this is pretty good food for $10,but it was really under-whelming. It got cold before we could even sit down, and the flavors were kinda boring.   We got one with prosciutto which had too much meat (too salty), and one with berries that just weren't ripe. The crepe itself was good, but the fillings were just bland...
4 This is my second time eating here and it's very good.  Both times I got the seafood crepe...YUMMY!
2 Mom had the tolouse (sausage, pepperoni  and red sauce) good but crepe was heavy. I had the ratatouille and egg crepe with a bechemel sauce, very good. The desert crepe was good but whipped creame was processes and bad. Three crepes and a diet coke over 35$. What can I say, that's Vegas!!  Not really worth it, sorry
5 In recent years La Creperie at The Paris Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas has become one of my Las Vegas eating staples. I can not complete a trip to Vegas without a delicious crepe (sometimes two).  My last trip to Las Vegas, I had a delicious "Seafood Crepe" featuring scallops and shrimp smothered in a sauce that I still think of to this day.  Later in my trip i stopped in for dessert and had my usual "The Nutella", Peanut butter & Banana's smothered in chocolate syrup and whipped cream. This has got to be the greatest dessert on earth...  Location wise it's easy to miss La Creperie. As you walk through the Paris "food court" (more of a hallway) it is stuffed between two large restaurants. There is VERY limited seating and sometimes you have to battle it out for a table but people seem to come and go fast enough that you shouldn't have a problem.  Price-wise it's extremely reasonable when you consider the quality and quantity you are getting. Let me speak from experience. I had crepes in Paris, France and they weren't as good as the one's I've had at Paris, Las Vegas. These are filling, tasty and leave such a lasting impression that I guarantee you will be back for more every time you visit Vegas!
2 I'm a huge breakfast lover. I can have French toast, crepes, or omelets at all hours of the day or night. When I was told that the Paris had an amazing crepe place I practically started running toward it. But when I finally saw the restaurant I got kind of bummed. I was expecting an actual restaurant and not a walk-up stand. But after realizing that it's supposed to resemble the walk-up creperies in Paris, France I was okay with the idea.  The line didn't take too long (maybe fifteen minutes or so) but when we're all about to eat our left hands out of hunger, fifteen minutes feels like an eternity. Finally we got to the front of the line. The menu has several savory crepes with meats and cheese as well as dessert crepes with berries, whipped cream, and other sugary additions.  I pretty much only like dessert crepes so my eyes lit up when I saw their abundance of fruits and sauces. I went with the Favorite crepe (with fresh berries, whipped cream, and topped with raspberry coulis). It was served to me at the pick-up counter on a cafeteria trey and a plastic plate. Lame. I then had to turn the corner and grab a plastic knife and plastic fork. Lame. Then came the really fun part; watching over people like hawks until a table opens up. The small seating area is just next door to La Creperie but it's open to anybody that wishes to sit there (surrounding snack stands, or people just giving their bunions a break).  After a couple minutes, we snagged a table and began digging in to our lovely crepes. They were almost impossible to cut into. The plastic utensils, plastic plates, and plastic treys made the crepes slide about relentlessly. After finally wrangling the thing down and cutting it up I got to taste it. Sheesh. I now understand why people were telling us to go here. The crepes were fantastic. However, I was somewhat distracted while we were eating. Several Miss America pageant girls came in and sat at the table next to us, fully equipped with tiaras and sashes. Awesome.  A tip after eating at La Creperie, go just across the walkway and pick up one of the humongous Eiffel Tower margaritas. You won't be disappointed!
4 I was in a rush to get some quick filling food before going out for the night. I'm so glad that La Creperie was so close to the hotel room elevator or else I probably wouldn't have found this amazing place in such a hurry. The seafood crepe that everyone was talking about is called Fruits De Mer which has shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, mozerella cheese, and fresh basil. It was sooooo delicious but they could've seasoned the seafood a little more. The plan was to go back to the hotel room, change clothes, and then eat it in the taxi but I ended up getting locked outside my hotel room so I ate it sitting outside my room as I waited for security to come let me in. I also ordered a Forestiere crepe, but I accidently left it in my room when I rushed to get in a taxi, so I didn't get to try it :(  The service is quick and the crepes will usually be ready in about 5-10 minutes. All their crepes (savory and dessert) are $9.99.
4 Best crepes on the strip.
4 Awesome crepes I would recommend the peanut
3 For the price, the portions are pretty decent, however after watching the chef make a few orders its clear that most of the crepes' fillings are pre-made and stored in large containers. Its probably not a big deal, considering this is basically an Americanized fast food version of a classic French staple. What do you expect?
4 Delicious! perfect to take girls to and get some sweet desserts. =]  See when I think of Crepes I think sweet, or desserts, and theyre nutella crepes are the best! however it is a bit overwhelming but overall a good crepe nontheless! and the crepes are just 10 dollars!! but for an enormous portion, enough for two people for sure!  Definitely recommend this place for dessert! very tasty!
4 This place is great for something quick. The crepes are $10, and if you want to maintain your buzz, you can get Bailey's for your coffee. I had the Bayonne, and woowhee! I was stuffed after about half the crepe. There's proscuitto in there that gives just enough of a salty taste, and enough cheese to coat the whole damn crepe.   I want one. Right now.
4 Granted, I've really never had a bad crepe...and I think it would actually be hard to have a botched crepe that is completely horrible because crepes are SO. FRICKIN. GOOD!!!  But the crepe I had here was excellent!  The D'Anjou is a crepe filled with pears, candied walnuts, and almond paste with a caramel topping and lots of whipped cream.  Num!  Since we were staying in Paris, I brought it up to the room, but forgot to get it 'to go'.  So I just carried the plate up.  While leaving La Creparie, a lady saw my dish and, with a thick French accent, asked "Excuse me, what kind of crepe is that?"  I told her "the D'Anjou crepe" in what I thought was my best French accent.  She didn't understand me (what can I say?...I took Spanish in high school  :P), so I translated for her and told her it was "the pear one".  Then in the elevator on the way up to the room, a French family was going up to their room.  They were all eyeing my crepe and talking about it in French, then asked where I got it from.  I let them know it was just downstairs.  Thankfully, they didn't ask me what kind of crepe it was because I didn't want to have to say the name again.  Who knew there were so many French people who fly half way around the world to stay at the Paris Hotel and eat crepes?!?  But I did a lot of free advertising for La Creperie with that D'Anjou!  Downsides: Long wait?  Yes.  There's usually a line.   Overpriced?  Yes.  It's $10/crepe.  Pricey, I know.  But, it's Vegas.  Your paying for the atmosphere of enjoying a yummy Parisian snack along a sidewalk in Paris without having to pay for a plane ticket to Europe.  :)
3 3.5 Stars   Pleasant surprise... crepe was better than we thought it would be. We decided to stroll down for breakfast, and decided to try this place out. $10 crepes are huge! Good for 2 people. We got a savory crepe. Can't remember the name exactly, but it had prosciutto, cheese, beshamel sauce, and basil. It was pretty good. Next time we'll have to try the sweet crepes.
4 We enjoyed eating the seafood crepe and the toulouse crepe. I was afraid that perhaps it would not be enough to eat for dinner before going across the street to see the O show. The portion size on the crepes were more than enough. They were packed with lots of flavor and quite yummy!   I'd definitely come again to grab a crepe the next time I visit Paris!
2 scenario:  -walk up to the counter -select from either 8 sweet or 8 savory $9.99 crepes -wait for your number to be called -walk your crepe over to a table and enjoy, or not...  just like arwen, i LOVE crepes. my friend and i used to take late night trips to Q-Cup in Milpitas for a delectable crepe and boba.   my most favorite crepe is a strawberry and banana crepe. i LOVE fruit and i LOVE it in a nice flat pancake! at La Creperie the fruit is either frozen or canned. whatever it is, it's not fresh and overly sweetened, you can taste the preservative...  i will say they give a generous serving of fruit, but i ended up throwing half of it away. it is not worth $10 and i have enjoyed yummier crepes at chain tapioca places?!?! come on paris hotel! i will not be going back...
5 Every once in a while, you find something that changes you... this crepe I got changed me.  I am not a big fan of crepes. I don't really seek them out... but this. WOW. Imma gonna say that again. WOW. We decided to get take out and eat back in our room, on our beds, and watch tv... ahahaa.   I got a Crepe D'Anjou (I think that's what it was called... like three of us ordered it). I got it the way they make it: a crepe with almond paste, pears, candied walnuts, whip cream drizzled with caramel sauce. My friend opted to get it with chocolate sauce instead of caramel. I was going to get it without the nuts, but that would have been a huge mistake! This is the best crepe I have ever had. Since I am not a crepe eater, this is the best dessert-instead-of-dinner I ever had. EVER HAD. The smoothness of the almond paste with the slight grittiness of the pears... the crunch and sweet of the walnuts... everything just worked so well together.   This isn't a full serve place. You place your order at the window and wait for your number to be called. Then you grab your scalding hot container and wish you asked for a bag to carry it away in. While waiting, a woman came up to the counter. When the cashier asked if she wanted anything, she just breathed deep and said no and stood there for a while...   Now that I am back home, I am wandering the streets looking for this. My friend is so desperate to have this again, she wants to buy a crepe pan and have us experiment at home to figure out how to make this. I would come back to Vegas for this crepe alone. No, I am not crazy. Have one...
2 When you dine at a crepe place in a hotel that puts "Le" in front of everything in order to seem more Parisian, you don't expect much for a reason. (if you can't tell, I'm not a huge fan of the Paris Hotel. In a city full of cheesy theme-park hotels and casinos, this is probably one of the cheesiest)  Needless to say, Le Creperie met my expectations: overpriced food for sub-par quality.
1 Getting a quick breakfast on "The Strip" can be a bit challenging if you aren't looking for a full-service restaurant. That's why I was excited to learn about La Creperie.  I ordered the Bayonne with "imported prosciutto, mozzarella, fresh basil, top with bechamel." After a surprisingly long wait, out came a folded crepe with HUGE chunks of incredibly, overpoweringly salty prosciutto inside, a small amount of melted cheese, and a few sprinkles of shredded basil on top.  I love salty food, but I could barely handle the massive amount of salty prosciutto in the crepe, especially compared with the mere token amount of barely basil. And the bechamel was just an added layer of gross.  Epic fail.
3 This crepe was delicious! Decided to get "The Favorite" and get some fruits in. The crepe was served with a delicious cream on top that put everything together. I had no shame and smothered this stuff all over instead of daintily putting it into the side.  The fruits inside were kind of the downer, it didn't really taste all that fresh and the blackberries were pretty sour. I ended up putting a lot of the fruits aside because it took away from the sweetness of the crepe. But, I did appreciate that they filled this baby up well.   If you're craving some dessert after dinner, this is a nice choice inside Paris, but beware of the sour fruits!
3 Located inside the Paris Hotel & Casino this little crepe house offers a limited amount of items on their menu.  Nevertheless they offer good quality for the food they make.  La Creperie offers both savory crepes and dessert crepes.  Although the savory crepes are nice once in awhile for me, I mainly like to order the dessert crepes from here.  The Nutella Crepe is my favorite at La Creperie, I wouldn't want to get any other crepe but if I had to choose another, I would order the Banana Foster's Crepe.  Lines get long during peak periods.  I like to come between lunch and dinner times when the lines move faster and the lines are not long at all.  Whatever you do, try the NUTELLA!!!...if you visit La Creperie.
4 I'm a huge fan of crepes, and after the Blue Man group, my girlfriend and I were very hungry. Since we were staying at Bally's we wanted something close and decided why not try a crepe?  It was interesting as this place doesn't stand out at all. It's like a little stand actually. If you don't look closely, you might miss it. It's located on the way to the Paris Casino. They have 3 savory and 3 sweet crepes from which to choose and they were all under 10 bucks. I think that's pretty good nowadays in Vegas.  We went with the Seafood Crepe which included Bechamel sauce, shrimp, scallops and spinach. It took about 10 minutes (they are all made fresh) and you can watch yours being made.   This was one of the best crepes I ever ate. Thick enough that it wasn't falling apart, fresh ingredients, and the Bechamel sauce was outstanding. We both felt this was the hidden gem of the trip.   Tip: There is seating between JJ's Boulangerie and Le Creperie so you don't have to stand to eat this wonderful creation.  If you like crepes and don't like spending a ton for them, this is the place.
1 Crepes are pricey and super bland not savory at all...
1 Awful! I just wanted a basic sugar crepe like the ones I had at the corner stands in Paris. 10 dollars for this basic item that cost two dollars in Paris. I paid it with a smile thinking it'd remind me of the delicious ones in France. Not even close. Overly dry, and the guys serving it appeared miserable.
4 I love this place!  I always get the Bananas Foster crepe and it's huge and delicious...it makes a good (albeit unhealthy) breakfast.  I haven't really tried any of their other crepes so I can't comment on those.  This place is just a little crepe stand across the walkway from the buffet, it's next to a breakfast place that is always super busy in the mornings.
4 I don't know why this place doesn't have a higher rating. It's delicious and the staff is very friendly. It's not a sit down restaurant so be prepared for that. It's a walk up window and you pick up your food when it's ready. They don't have a huge selection but what they do have is tasty. I was actually surprised at how yummy my crepe was. It's a good low key place.
5 Crepes her are amazing!!!!  There is a 20 minute wait to get your crepe during the peak times, but it is well worth the wait! I go with the St. Louis.  The ham/basil/bechamel combo is amazing.  The dessert crepes are great too.   I usually stop at the bar across the hall for a white russian or screwdriver. Definitely one of my favorite places for breakfast in Vegas.
4 An accidental discovery as I was walking around Paris after a long night.  I decided to come here instead of the buffet which is across the pathway. As a crepe place in the Paris hotel, I expected it to be awesome and it met my expectations! They have a good selection of dessert and savory crepes.  Crepes: 1) Nutella Crepe with Bananas - Very soft and delicious, but it was a little too sweet with the chocolate and the whipped cream. A crepe with nutella and fruit is enough.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q?select=Hc6LPpoACvPTE_457TUOPg  2) Bayonne Crepe - Prosciutto, mozzarella, fresh basil, and bechamel. What to say... It had some of my favorite fresh ingredients except bechamel. I had no idea what the heck that was, but provided a good flavor.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6fPQJq4f_yiq1NHn0fd11Q?select=ac9-kNlfYElhfxc5TxW--g  Don't go during peak times, because it can be difficult to find tables. You might end up having to take it back up to your room.
4 We always get the French riviera and salmon crepes and they are delicious! We have also had the chicken cordon blue, but the chicken was a little overdone. This was still very good and it came w/sautéd spinach and fries and a delicious cream based mushroom sauce.  I think they also have 1/2 off bottles of wine on Mon & Tues. This place has adorable decor and I can't wait to go check out the new downtown long beach location.
3 Doesn't compare to the real deal but close enough for Vegas. I got the St. Louis for lunch. The line was long and so was the wait time. The portions are generous and fairly cheap (around $10 per crepe) but there is no overall pizzazz to the food. More quantity over quality.
3 Avoid the seafood crepe.   But everything else was yummy! My favorite was the Prosciutto and cheese crepe. It was the perfect amount of saltiness and chessyness.   I think you'd fare better if you stick with the dessert crepes :)
4 Biggest crepes you'll see.  If there was going to be one thing I'd be negative about it would be the size.  You can't have something be that big and offer it with decadent fillings.  Moderation would suit Le Creperie better, and they wouldn't lose anything on taste.  I ordered The Favourite (triple berry crepe) and it was later in the evening.  It was a lot to eat and ultimately go to sleep on, but I was a true glutton and ate the damn thing and enjoyed every bite.  I was going to order the Nutella filled one, and started regretting my choice, but once I saw how big it was, I was glad I didn't get all that chocolate filling.  Yummy regardless.
4 A hidden little gem that's cheap (for Vegas) and where the crepes are great. If you're looking for a light meal and an inexpensive at that, look no further.
2 Not impressed.  My out-of-town friend and I were strolling in the Paris hotel when we got an urge for crêpes....saw La Creperie and decided to check it out.  First, we were the only ones ordering crêpes.  No excuses for poor or slow service, right?  Second, le monsieur at the window must have been having an off day because he didn't smile at all.  I have heard from reputable sources that French ppl are not the most gregarious of folk, but sheesh.  Would it kill ya to smile?  Third, our Napolean (lemon curd/berry) crêpes needed more curd.  There was only a teaspoon or so of the curd which translates to too many naked, dry crépe bites.  Perhaps I should try the savoury crêpes to compare?   Our crêpes took longer than I thought to make, given the fact that there was no one else ordering anything.  Will I return?  Probably not.  Hélas.  Le sigh.
2 I used to LOVE this place a couple years ago. My friend wanted to try it & I was down, considering I really enjoyed their crepes.   Ordered the Nutella crepe w/ banana (extra $2.00). It was good, but not as good as I remembered. Maybe not worth my $10 anymore, which totally sucks. It didn't seem like there was a whole banana in there either, ugh.   Not sure if I'll be back here again. It kinda lost its edge in my book. I'd rather use my $10 somewhere else.
5 These are the best crepes I've ever had. I eat here every morning I'm in Vegas. If you love crepes this is a must do!!!
4 AWESOME! Im not even a crepe person.... which may be a good thing for this review or bad... but I usually feel crepes are just ok, nothing special.   But these crepes!   Muuuwwwaaaaaahhh! Delicioso! (oops thats Spanish) Well, whatever the word is in French for an Effffff AMAZING taste ... that's the Napoleon Crepe here inside the Paris Hotel and Casino.   YUMMM YUM!
4 after waiting a legit freakin hour i get my crepe. The Napoleon: crepe filled with lemon curd?, blackberries, raspberries and perhaps blueberries topped with some whipped cream= holy shit that is good. An hour wait is an hour wait but those crepes are good. I would come here when it is not peak hours (I came around 11- was there till about 12:30) My peep got the Favorite and he said that was bomb as well. Maybe next time i will share and get a savory as well as a sweet crepe. Also Crepes are all $10, but they are huge and well worth it.. What is not worth it is their small coffee which is priced at $3. Buy your Crepe here and your coffee at the cafe next door. Iced Mochas are only $4 next door. Way better price.
3 I reallyyyy really wanted dessert after eating not the best dinner...and since we were back in the hotel at Paris I decided to stop by here.  The cashier lady was very nice and kind, but seemed to have a bit of trouble at the register.  I think maybe something was broken so it took a while for us just to get to order.  I ordered the Napoleon crepe, lemon custard, berries, chantilly cream, nom nom nom! It was REALLY good, the tartness of the custard and lightly sweet thick chantilly cream worked well together.  Unfortunately they don't fill all the way to the edge so the front tip of the triangle is filled while the back end is just crepe.  Is that how it's done in Paris?  I also feel like they were a bit too thick and eggy to be considered "good" crepes, but it was tasty nonetheless. I think the filling just sold me...  $9.99 does seem expensive to me for a crepe since they are kind of cheap to make...but it is Vegas so got to expect everything to be expensive :P  I MIGHT come back here again just for the Napoleon...if I'm ever in Vegas again...
3 Let me keep it simple. It's a little overpriced and pretty mediocre. It's faster than other food options at Paris though.
5 Expensive, but the crepes are enormous and have the freshest and finest ingredients. I could eat this every morning.
4 We always have to eat here. Whether you crave something sweet or savory, you can't beat these crepes after some typical Vegas drinking!
4 This is always a must visit on vegas trips.  I've had the St. Louis crepe (ham and cheese) and Nutella (peanut butter and banana). Yumm this place is consistently delicious every time.  The 20 minute wait is worth it for these crepes, just try and find a table early on since the seating is shared with the café next door. Seems a little pricey at about $10 but what isn't pricey in Vegas?
5 why oh why doesn't Phoenix offer a crepe place? if it did, i would make special trips just to stuff my face with a crepe.   although i'm no novice to crepes, i still, still, still love the nutella crepe. with it's hot, gooey, hazelnut chocolate dripping outta the sides and the warm fluffy crepe, it's heaven i declare....HEAVEN!   i wasn't even hungry but when we were walking through the Paris casino, i knew it would be ages before i'd get to have another crepe. long live Paris for your delicious crepes at La Creperie!
4 Savory and sweet yummies....  Located towards the back of the Paris Hotel, past the casino.  It's kind of like a little stand tucked in between other little shops, kind of across from the buffet.  I wouldn't say these are the best crepes in the world, but for being right on the strip (and maybe the only one?) these crepes do the job for me.  I always try to stop by for lunch whenever I"m in town.  They have a communal area to sit next to La Creperie window.  Yah theses medium sized crepes are almost 10 bucks, but it's Vegas and at least they will fill you up.  They have a decent selection of savory and sweet crepes.  I always go for the Bayonne:  prosciutto and mozzarella topped with  bechamel and basil for the savory, and the nutella and banana for the sweet :-) Deeelish!
3 So good.  Especially after a busy night beforehand - wedding celebrations can be exhausting!  The only thing I would have liked is more seating options but alas our group made it work so all is well :)
3 Crepes made fresh to order.  My hubby and I ordered two crepes, "The Favorite" which had fresh strawberries, blueberries and raspberries and the "Rum Banana" which had sliced bananas that were cooked in rum.  The Rum banana was awesome! It was like having bananas fosters inside a fresh, hot crepe.  Very delicious and highly recommended.  "The Favorite" was not really my favorite, ironically as it was way too tart.  Presentation wise, "The Favorite," was beautiful and looked delicious to eat, but like I mentioned, it was too tart and the crepe was overdone (as in crispy).  Totally disappointing.    This place is pretty pricey in my book, the cost for both crepes came out to $21.60!  OUCH!!!  If we ever come back, which I doubt we will, I think we will stick to ordering the "Rum Banana."
2 I'm sorry to say I dont like anything about La Creperie. Sadly, it la sucks.  The Soleil crepe in particular sucks, the ratatouille was disgusting. I dont use disgusting lightly (not about food anyway) but it was really really bad. It tasted like old tomatoes that had been marinated overnight in a weird sauce that I dont understand. Once I got all that off my crepe, it was edible but certainly not enjoyable.  The Forestiere  crepe was good, but not amazing. I've had much better crepes in Seattle... Disappointed.  I dont like the counter you order at, nor the way the people behind the counter wont make eye contact. I got coffee there once too and it was burned. I like the Paris, but this wasnt a good representation of their quality.
3 Came here to catch a quick bite before taking the family to see the Nutcracker. It's a small shop along their faux street where you order at a counter, wait for your food, then hope you can find seating. Our order was up in about 10 minutes and lucked out by grabbing a tiny table to eat at. Between the three of us (2 adults and a kid) 2 crepes were plenty filling.  St. Louis ($9.99) - imported ham and mozzarella and fresh basil with bechamel. The description mentioned imported ham. Maybe they meant imported from the local grocery store, because the ham didn't taste any better than what I get at Albertson's. The bechamel sauce was too thin and runny for my liking.  Toulouse ($9.99) - ground sausage, pepperoni, sautéed mushrooms, mozzarella, basil, topped with marinara. This was the better of the two that we ordered. Tasted just like a pizza. The marinara lacked the depth in flavor that would make it special, but was good enough to satisfy.  This might be a good place for a quick bite, but definitely not some place that I would seek out or ever crave. The portions are ridiculously large, so share.
1 EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!  worst crepe ever!! i got the standard nutella with berries/cream....it was disgusting!
1 This crepe is positively creepy. Burnt, hard around the edges, veggies in middle were cold.  They are so busy they don't care. Concept is good but they definitely new quality control based upon the other positive reviews.
1 My boyfriend and I were craving something sweet and small so we decided to come to this tiny shack place. We ordered Bayonne and Napoleon Dessert Crepes.  Portion is good to share with one person. Personally I rather have ice cream Crepes than just fruit Crepes. I don't like savory Crepes because it tastes weird. It's like eating something hot fruits. Well the reason why I don't like the Bayonne is because the pork tasted funny and it was full of cheese. A little too much cheese for me. For $8.99, I'd rather just get something else like a slice of cheese pizza.   The person who took our order was kinda rude. (not to us, but to the people in front of us) The family in front of us doesn't speak English, so they didn't know how to order. They had a difficult time pronouncing the name of the dish and the cashier was rolling his eyes and rushing them. How rude...  I wouldn't come back.
4 Crepes the size of my head filled with nutella and topped with a giant dollop of cream? Yes please!   The only downside is I tried to eat this by myself, and failed. Definitely for two...or three.  A bit on the pricey side, but definitely better than the thing they called crepe at Mon Ami Gabi.
5 Omg! It was like heaven. So yumi. So large...have an appetite because it is so very much food. The staff was friendly and helpful. I can't wait to go back!
4 I wasn't sure what to expect from La Creperie, but was pleasantly surprised.  I don't normally likes crepes, but my wife and her sister were insisting we try this place.  We ordered the Forestiere  (Sauteed spinach, Mushrooms, cheese and topped with Bechamel) and Fruits De Mer (Seafood crepe) along with 2 savory crepes (don't recall the names, but it was one with berries and such in it).  We enjoyed this meal quite a bit and the price was nice for the location it's at and the quality of the food.  We were stuffed, and payed a fraction of the cost and had a fraction of the wait than those who were waiting for the buffet just across the way.
4 These things are amazing. I haven't had one yet that I didn't like! They are big so I suggest sharing one! It also helps to cut down the calories... But your in Vegas so who cares about that anyway!? I do like the feel of the little alley that all the shops are on at the Paris... It does add to the experience. It's a must go if you are looking for something sweet to eat while in Vegas.
1 10$ for a Crêpe. Really?????  Overpriced & Bad. Never ever again
1 This was the worst crepe place I've been to. The crepe was overpriced. The crepe itself was really rubbery. They used frozen fruits instead of canned fruits and the whipped cream they supposedly made themselves were awful. In addition to the crappy crepe, the cashier was rude and didn't tell me my crepe was ready and had left it just sitting at the counter when it was made.
5 Amazing crepe, and yes it was expensive, but it was big enough for two so it was not like it wasn't worth it. And considering it is inside a strip hotel, it could definitely be worse...
4 Not all the crepes are good!  Just because you didnt like the crepe you had doesnt mean there is nothing good on the menu! I tried the seafood crepe and berry crepe and didnt care for either. Now that i know what i like i never order anything but the Apple or pear crepe. We usually order 2 crepes and 2 Baileys coffees with the bill being $30. We dont care because its a treat that we only get maybe twice a year!
4 Always tasty and a great value for the strip. Simple but good ingredients. Super casual and good people watching from the patio.
4 Delish! But new friend Lisa couldn't finish her sweet one!  I stopped in here with my (then) boyfriend when we visited Vegas back in ought-six. The crepes were so memorable that I knew I'd be back the next time I was in town. It took me six years, but I made it, the crepes were still wonderful and the prices were still reasonable. (In my opinion. If you are looking to stuff yourself silly for a few dollars more, there is a buffet across the hallway.)  This little place is in the mall portion of the Paris LasVegas Hotel & Casino. Walk up to order, and grab a table in the seating area off to the side. The ingredients are simple, delicious and filling. I was alone this time, and made friends/shared a table with another solo diner in the seating area.
2 Ew. I am just judging one crepe (the vegetarian mushroom one with béchamel) but it was really, really bad. Not worth the line!
4 Every once in a while you can still find a bargain on the strip. I often dread walking into the strip casinos as many of the restaurants have gone the route of expensive, hip, trendy but low quality or overpriced food choices.  So Wife, Child and I were wandering through Paris, I forget why, maybe to check out Sweet Factory.  We were walking through the mall towards the casino and we saw Le Creperie.  Ok, we were hooked.  My wife loves crepes and most things french and my daughter needed to experience them.  We got a savory seafood crepe and a sweet nutella crepe.  Both were delicious.  The price may be a dollar higher than I would like but for the size of the crepes I think it is worth it. Plus you get free refill your own sodas at the pizza place next door.    There are not as many selections as I would hope and the line sometimes gets long.  The seating is first come first serve for both Pizza and Crepes and there is not very much of it so send someone from your group to vulture a table while you wait in line.  I am certain there are better crepes out there and that they are probably cheaper but for a strip shop this place is the bomb.com
5 How have I not reviewed this place yet?  This is arguably my favorite stop in Vegas.  It's a special place for me, because on our first trip to Vegas very early on in our dating times, my now-fiancé and I must have eaten like 6 crepes from here.  I think I've tried nearly everything on the menu that isn't meat-y.  The crepes are $9.99 and come in sweet and savory varieties -- we mostly go with the sweet -- my favorite is the peanut one, but strangely I don't order it much due to its richness.  My second favorite is the D'anjou pear one with walnuts.  The apple one is the most basic, and they all come with this yummy whipped cream on top that melts into the crepe -- we get it on the side to save my stomach from lactose issues.  The one savory one I've tried is the one with ratatoulle and egg... very tasty and fresh.  I love that all the crepes are made-to-order and generous.  The only downside is the seating.  Except for the one time we showed up shortly before it closed,  we literally have to circle the eating area to the left of this place to be able to sit our butts down the second someone leaves.  Otherwise, you'll have nowhere to sit and enjoy your yummy crepe.  Overall, a cheap snack or meal.
5 A crepe window in the Paris Casino Hotel. How authentic eh. Sounds cheesy right? Well I will be damned if this is not some of the best crepes I have ever had. Cheap (for vegas), huge and damn delicious. This is like a fluffy little nirvana. I usually love the sweet crepes but here I also love the savory. There are just too many choices. I think that I need to stay at the Paris next time so that I can eat here every day and try everything on the menu. Amazing. Do it. Or Else. Understand?
2 I'm a fan of crepes, so my husband and I tried La Creperie in the Paris hotel. We arrived mid-morning on a weekday, so the line was short and sufficient seating was available. However, I can see how the seating area would fill up quickly on a weekend.  La Creperie has both sweet and savory crepes, though not a large selection of either type. All crepes are $9.99 each plus tax. We ordered the "Favorite Crepe", which has blueberries, strawberries and raspberries in a raspberry coulis, and the "Bananas Foster Crepe", which has bananas sauteed in dark rum.   The crepes were served on a fairly flimsy plate, which was okay, but the plastic knife and forks were ridiculously small (the cheapest you can find, you know the ones I'm talking about). I'm okay with disposable utensils, but the ones at almost any fast food restaurant are better. Each crepe came with a generous scoop of whipped cream. I tasted both flavors, and they were both okay, but not great. Also, the crepes got cold rather quickly.  I might try this place again if someone recommended a better flavor and I brought my own fork.
4 These were quite possibly the best crepes I've ever had. Honestly, I can't say I've ever been a crepe lover, but I'd eat them every day if they came from here. I got the Soliel and asked them to add ham. Yes, it was $9, but it was too much for one person to eat in one sitting (in my opinion). So, given that you can get two meals for the price of one, I think it's totally worth it.
2 My second worst crepe experience ever!  I ordered a cheese and prosciutto crepe. The crepe was almost thick as a pancake and really doughy. I like doughy crepes but they should be much thinner. It was also not very hot. The prosciutto was too thick and it was kind of too strong in flavor. Worst of all are the flimsy forks they give you. I had a hell of a time trying to cut the prosciutto.  My BF ordered a decent veggie crepe. Mushroom and spinach I think. This crepe was also doughy and thick. If it were not for this decent crepe I would give this place one star.  The coffee here is awful. I will never return.  Parking is a breeze usually and it's free. It's in the Paris parking structure.  When we got here it was not too busy but when we passed by later on it was really packed. I really wonder why....The only cool thing here is checking out the stereotypical Parisian outfits the employees have to wear haha!
5 I love this place. We are staying at Paris and have gotten crepes for breakfast every day. My favorite is the Bananas Foster. So incredibly delicious! Some other reviewers have mentioned flimsy utensils and paper plates, but who cares, really? The crepes are the best!
2 I ordered the St. Louis (ham, cheese, and basil) savory crepe.  Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed.  My crepe was too thick and the ham was all where the fold of the crepe was.  There wasn't a lot of ham either, and it tasted like supermarket deli ham.  Maybe their sweet crepes are better.
4 Mixed berries? What do you mean I can't have just strawberries? You're serious?   Sigh...   Ended up getting my usual strawberry, whipped cream and Nutella crepe without the strawberries, and it cost La Creperie a star. Lucky for them, their crepes are absolutely fantastic. Though they are on the expensive side of the crepe scale, for Vegas, the prices seem fair.   The Nutella crepe I ordered was packed with Nutella, and served with a generous amount of whipped creme and a thick drizzle of chocolate. The pancake itself had a perfect flavor and texture. It was glorious. My girlfriend ordered a savory crepe filled with ham, cheese, and a variety of other goodies, and it too was wonderful.   Even if you're not staying at Paris, you should give this place a try.
4 i LOVE LOVE everything about Crepes, so i was definitely excited when i saw this place. My friends and I each ordered a crepe, I was blown away by the size of it. The size was so large, it could have been easily shared with 2 or 3 people. The sweet ones were a little too sweet and the savory ones were a little too salty.    It was still a good experience!
4 I had the Napoleon crepe...I can totally say that I love the berries and the sweetness was just right.
2 They say it's the same, but it's not the same.  Maybe because it was my first time and you always remember your first, but this was only passable. I mean, it was still a okay crepe, but not how I remember it.   I obviously got the D'Anjou again. The time before, it was filled with an almond cream that was like marzipan. This time, I think it was a runny vanilla sauce without any hint of almond. The pears were the same, the chantilly cream was the same, the caramel was the same... but where is my marzipan???   Sigh. I say "Meh. I've experienced better" but it was them... I swear they gave me better before.
4 The crepes are good. The kids shared the nutella and bananas while the wife and I shared the bayonne.   I'd get the bechemel on the side next time; very creamy with very little flavor.
3 I had the Bayonne and unfortunately, it wasn't that great. There was too much prosciutto (yes, that is possible) and the flavor of the prosciutto was too strong. However, the crepe itself was pretty good. I only wish they didn't slather on the sauce to the point of drowning the crepe.  I would suggest going for a sweet crepe.
2 I bought the Toulouse crepe, which reminded of a pizza before eating. The crepe looked delicious and was freshly made. The Fresh basil on top was a nice touch  The mariana sauce was cold when they put it on top of the crepe so it ruined the entire dish. :( This also made the cheese clump together faster, making it more dissatisfying by the bite. It had so much potential!!! I'm disappointed.
4 Not bad. A bit overpriced. Coffee subpar.
5 This place makes the best crepes that I have ever eaten outside of the Paris Hotel.
4 The #4 Nutella and a Starbucks latte solved my wife's hang over blues every morning -patience required since its popular
4 YUM!!!! So this is basically a fast food window for crepes. Next door to the shop is a nice little place you can sit and eat your delicious crepes. We went for lunch and had a wonderful meal - and one that was honestly too much food for 2 people. We got 1 savory and 1 sweet crepe and we could barely finish the sweet one (though we did it was so good).  ~ Caramelized Pear $10.25 caramelized pears, raisins, maple syrup, candied hazelnuts & chantilly cream. This was wonderful- sweet, warm, and the combination of soft pears and crunchy nuts was wonderful. One needs a tea or water to cut the sweetness after a while though. I think it would have been even better with peaches- which I seem to recall they used to have (I've been here before) but I'm not 100% sure on that. ~ Ham & Cheese $11.45 parisian ham, gruyere & béchamel sauce. WOWOWOWOW!! This was AMAZING! If you only have room for 1 crepe get this one. The meat  has a wonderfully smoky flavor and the gruyere is the perfect addition to the dish. The creamy and salty flavors mix well and leave you very full.   For roughly $20 you can be stuffed and spend the rest of your time walking it off in either the casino or the strip!
4 This place is a "must-have" if you're in the mood for great, classy dessert on the Vegas strip. Its right in the heart of he "streets" of Paris hotel, which makes it authentic and fun. The Dessert crepes were delicious (I had the apple one).  The only reason I have it four stars instead of five was because it was takeout instead of sit down. They have seats available but you have to order and wait for food, then sit down. It could have been really classy if they served it and had more formal seating. Still MUST have this. So good!
3 I thought my savory pesto roasted chicken crepe was delicious! Lots of chicken, asparagus, and sun dried tomatoes (maybe even a little too many sun dried tomatoes..). It was surprisingly filling despite it just being a single crepe. Some friends got the sweet one with nutella and the one covered with fruit, and consensus was that everyone was happy. Prices ran about $10-$11.   I've never had a "real" crepe in France before, so I guess I don't know if these are legit or not, but overall it was satisfying and a quick and easy way to grab something to eat!
4 I ate here a few Monday's ago for breakfast with my girlfriend.  I had looked at the menu the night before and knew that I had to decide between a savory ham & cheese crepe and a more sweet blueberry lemon crepe.  That morning I was feeling savory and so I went over to find a seat in the seating area while my girlfriend did the ordering.  Due to that I don't really have much to say about the place itself since I did not see much of it.  My ham and cheese crepe came out to me looking nice and covered in a béchamel sauce which I mistook as cheese.  The crepe was pretty tasty as ham was good and salty which paired nicely with the Gruyere and it quickly disappeared from my plate.  Whenever my girlfriend had also finished her crepe we started talking about ordering a sweeter crepe for a dessert of sorts.  My girlfriend decided to spoil me and let me have both of the crepes that I had thought looked good the night before by deciding to split the blueberry lemon crepe with me.  She once again went over and ordered and came back with an amazing looking plate.  The crepe was in the center covered in a berry sauce, blueberries and powdered sugar with a Chantilly cream on the side.  In the middle of the crepe was some lemon curd which gave the dish some sourness that worked really well with everything else that was sweet on the plate to keep it from being too sweet.  In the end there was nothing left as we both had enjoyed our meal.  The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  While I believe that it is a bit overpriced to enjoy on a regular basis, the food is great and it could easily be a nice little treat every now and again.
5 My boyfriend and I had our fourth year anniversary trip in Vegas this November and stayed at Paris for a couple of nights.  We were so hungry we stopped by the restaurants near the entrances and front desks just to get a quick bite.    Now, the two of us met at a creperie that we worked at five years ago, and we know our French and Japanese crepes pretty damn well - these quick crepes were flavorful and seemed to never be enough.  With total rewards card for Caesar Casinos, including Paris, you could save a dollar or so each crepe!  Never got to try a sweet one, but the savory pesto roasted chicken crepe is highly recommended.  The shrimp scampi crepe is super buttery and feels like it's coating my throat, but I wouldn't say it was a true ode to shrimp scampi pasta if it didn't!
5 I've eaten here a couple times since they've opened, probably been a decade now. I try to go maybe once every other year and each time it's awesome and tasty!!! The crepes are fresh (made right there in front of you) and the staff is usually pretty nice. The choices for savory and sweet are great and if you can't find one you don't think you'd like, then you probably just don't like crepes haha! Totally a must if walking in Paris LV!
2 The crepe is thick and doughy and there is not much content inside. My chicken was cold. Prices are raised from what used to be $9.99 to ~$14. This is not a sit down restaurant but more like a cafeteria of tables, and you order and pick up your food at the counter.  From what I remember, the dessert crepes are more edible than the savory ones.  Makes me so sad because nothing makes me happier than some perfect, delicious crepes...this place does not cut it :-(  Still it's one of the more fast and affordable eats in Vegas, and is easy to find inside of Paris.
3 Solid crepes, but not much selection on the menu. Definitely overpriced.  Nutella crepe is the best (without the bananas). Yum!
1 Wasn't like it used to be. I had the nutella crepe. It was crispy instead of soft and pillowy. I'm surprised to say that there was too much nutella to crepe ratio. Banana was fresh. Whipped cream was awesome as before. It's not the same as it used to be.
4 Great crepes. I had the caramelized pears--delicious. Not to overly sweet.
4 The pear dessert crepe was super delicious!  The pears were diced up small and lightly sweetened, and the crepe was made to order, meaning fresh and soft!  Also I had a cup of grande-sized coffee with a small bottle of Bailey's Mint-flavored Irish Cream added, for an extra $2.50.  One dessert crepe (huge portion) and a cup of coffee for $18-ish was such a steal in Vegas!!    Seriously, this place is good!  Every time I go to Vegas, I have to stop by La Creperie to get my crepe fix!  Both sweet and savory crepes here are delish!
4 Located inside the Paris hotel.  I had the shrimp and wild mushroom crepe.  I used my hotel comp and note that you can get discounted price if you show your total rewards card.  The crepe was delish!  Shrimp and mushrooms created this incredible combination.  The portion was enough for one person.  It was made to order and I will definitely come back for this crepe.  I've also had their nutella crepe before and it was just perfect if you like nutella.  Hazelnut spread with bananas are a perfect match!
4 Not bad. Although I didn't try their hot crepe, but I did love their dessert strawberry crepe. Probably one of the best one i had so far..
4 have a crepe in paris :) You can get full off of one crepe! with strip prices I feel like the prices here are reasonable. Go to paris and have the france experience yay! Good, fast and affordable!
5 Amazing. Easily the best crepe I have ever had in my life.
4 Best crepes in Vegas. For a complete review with pictures check out my blog post about my trip to Vegas: http://girlgoneveggie.com/eating-my-way-through-vegas/
5 This place is a MUST every time we visit Vegas. No matter what time of the day, this hits the spot.    I usually get the "Favorite" and the hubs gets the ham and hollandaise.  Of course, then we share.  We have tried others and not been disappointed once.    Consider you are in Vegas when you pay.  Everything in Vegas costs a little bit more than average.  The seating is my least favorite part of the experience, but we always end up finding a place to enjoy our treat.
1 They changed the fricken recipes! the crepes used to be much better until the menu change after October 2012.  My favorite crepe used to be the apple crepe and they used to caramelize the apples and it would be warm. Now they have raw, sour, cold granny smith apples with the skins still on smothered in some cold caramel sauce. i guess they changed it because its quicker and cheaper.I actually returned the crepe and told them the new menu change sucks. Why do places always have to mess with a good thing?
5 Everytime I am in Vegas, this is my must have food either for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  Depending on the time of the day, sometimes I get the savory with cheese and spinach or fresh berries.  Which ever are so good.  It's pricey, over $10 for French crepe, but then again you are in Vegas.  The portion is rather huge, be hungry when you order one or get one to share.
5 Nutella crepe! A must have for the hubby and I when we visit vegas. Love the ham and cheese crepe for a savory salty fix.
4 Convenient location for a quick meal between conference sessions. I actually visited La Creperie twice during the week I was in Vegas, and got to try 3 different crepes by sharing with friends. I tried the fresh berry, caramel apple, and roasted chicken crepes. I highly recommend all three, but my favorite was the caramel apple. Oh my goodness... tart green apples with tons of gooey caramel... soooo yummy :) All crepes were about $10-12 dollars, and one of the days I visited they were running a special so I got a crepe and a fountain soda for $10- cheaper than the crepe alone!   Side note: This is one of the few locations in the shops that you will find a bathroom and open seating... take advantage.
5 best crepes in vegas!!
3 The line for La Creperie wasn't too long when I got there; maybe 5 people ahead of me. But it seemed like the line took soooo long to move. There's only one person taking orders as well as handing out the crepes once they are done. I actually noticed that my crepe order was ready for a while before the cashier/order taker/food giver noticed. Operations would be much more efficient if they had another person handing out the crepes.   If you're a Total Rewards member, you can get a discount on the crepes, but they also offer a crepe special where you can get a crepe and a drink for less than what the price of a crepe costs. I'm not sure how they make money off of that, but whatever, my mom and I both ordered the special. I got the ham and cheese crepe and my mom got the fresh berry crepe. Both were good, but I thought my ham and cheese was a little dry and could have used more cheese. The fresh berry one could use more berries. For the price we paid, I was expecting a little more.   Seating is pretty easy to find as there's an open sitting area next to La Creperie. If the restaurant next door is closed, you can also sit there.   I probably would try a crepe again, but only if there wasn't a line!
4 Always one of the best crepes. I had the caramelized pear crepe.
1 Worse Crepe I ever had. The man doing the crepes was very sloppy and careless. I ordered a Nutella crepe and it looked as if he had to scrape the Nutella out of the bottle. The whole top half of the crepe didn't have Nutella. On top of that its expensive. Never again.
4 Banana nuttella crepe is excellent. Fast service!
4 I usually always go here when I'm in Vegas for at least one of my breakfasts. The crepes are delicious (especially the savory ones!). The menu changes seasonally, I believe, because last time I came, they did not have my favorite, which is the ratatouille crepe. Note, if you ever see it on the menu, GET IT! The service is always fast and friendly, and I have never disliked any of the crepes I've gotten here. My one and only complaint is that the crepes are kind of small for the amount you pay for them, but then again, it is Vegas. I'd definitely recommend for a snack, breakfast, or lunch.
4 My husband and I really enjoyed the crepes we ate at the La Creperie. Located in the Paris Hotel, it's just a little walk up window with a small menu.  There's always a decent line at this place, but they are very fast with getting the food out. Right next to it, there are plenty of tables and chairs to sit at and people watch. All the crepes were $9.99. They were a very decent size and filling for breakfast. First time we went, I had the crepe with spinach, mushroom, and cheese, topped with a bechamel sauce. It was awesome! My husband got a crepe Suzette, which he enjoyed.  Second time we went, we got the nutella crepe.  It was good, but it was almost too rich.  It was only nutella on the inside and topped with whipped cream.  Could have used maybe some fruit inside like strawberries or bananas to cut the sweetness.  We would definitely eat here again. It's also great for people that want to eat and run because you have a busy day ahead of you and don't want to wait forever to be served.
5 These are some of the best crepes I've ever had.
4 Maybe I'm a crepe snob, but crepes should be delicate creations of sweet and/or savory components. Some more finesse would have been enjoyable, however I'm still going to give this place 4 stars since it really doesn't get much better in the states. I had the berry crepe which was very good. Wife had the pear crepe. She love it but I hated it (maple syrup, raisins, sugar, and minuscule bits of sweet pear) - way too sweet for me. Nonetheless, a great breakfast to nurse a slight hangover on a Wednesday morning and would definitely come back!
5 OH MY GOD IS THIS PLACE GREAT.....NOW DISCLAIMER.............If you have a normal metabolism you will get fat by eating here.  Its just the way it is.  But WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW!!!  Its soo fricken good.
3 La Creperie is located at the Paris Hotel & Casino.  It's always tempting to stop here when we are passing through.  I've only given into the temptation one time though.  Actually, we stopped that time cause our niece and nephew wanted crepes, and there were no lines on that occasion.  They've got the usual crepe choices.  Both savory crepes and dessert crepes.  I always prefer the dessert crepes cause I am such a sweet tooth.  The prices are expensive compared to most crepes that I've had elsewhere.  Although, if you are a Total Rewards member, then you get a discounted price of 50 cents off.  Still expensive though.  Our niece and nephew both enjoyed their choices while my wife and I thought our orders were just average.  Both my niece and I ordered the Nutella crepe which contained nutella, bananas, candied hazelnuts, cream, and caramel sauce.   She said she would give it 8 out of 10.  I thought that for the price, it was just average.  It tasted fine, but it should be priced 2 to 3 dollars lower.  Same for the other crepes that we ordered which were the mixed berries crepe and the ham & cheese crepe.    Overall, just 3 stars because the crepes are overpriced.  I know that we're on the Las Vegas Strip, but come on!  Well, obviously the prices do not hurt business cause they usually have people waiting to order at the window when we walk by.  Good for them.
4 This is the second day we eat crepes but the 1st time at le Creperie. Prices were relatively average. Definitely less than at The Blizzz at the MGM. It was intensely buttery and decadent. My son, 7,  ordered the Butter&sugar crepe- yum. It did not disappoint. My daughter,12, ordered the apple & caramel-again, yummy. The Granny Smith apples were indeed crunchy. I ordered the roasted chicken w pesto, etc.- yum. This was a definite Score! -in our search for awesome savory and sweet crepes. Oh and the have combo deals. You know buy crepe and drink for one set price. We will definitely return.
4 Quick and delicious. I had the three cheese crepe which was savory and flavorful. Decent prices by Vegas standards.
4 Great selection, VERY tasty crepes and great location. There's plenty of seating and a bathroom close by.  We had a roasted chicken crepe with pesto and sun dried tomatoes. Great price, prepared quickly and it was affordable.
4 Its a great option for a snack or breakfast at the Paris.  Like everything in Vegas, it is overpriced for what it is but for me it was worth it.   The crepes are very good, both the savory and the sweet ones.  They are well made and the ingredients are very fresh.  The creperie does not have its own seating area but shares one with a couple of other places in the Paris and the options for hot drinks was pretty limited.
5 My love affair with crepes was rekindled last year during a visit to Paris, France.  Since then, I have tried, with varying degrees of success, to find excellent creperies.  La Creperie definitely meets the grade - in fact, these are the best crepes I've tasted since France.  The pancake part of the crepe has a wonderful thickness, it's substantial, not thin and skinny.  All the crepes I had: ham and cheese, three cheese, and the pear crepe - were fantastic.  My only regret is that I didn't have more opportunity to try some of their other crepes, before coming home to a comparatively crepe-challenged area!
4 Excellent crepes, the bakery next store is fantastic !  Love the chicken and sun dried tomatoes.
4 My husband and I get a little obsessive when we experience good food.  (On a trip to Colorado we ran across a fantastic little place that sold the most amazing hand pies and we ate 16 hand pies over the course of 2 days.) So, that's pretty much what happened here at The Creperie.  Less than 18 hours in Las Vegas and we had already tried 5 crepes.  Yum, yum and more yum.  They are so light and eggy and the fillings (ham and cheese, shrimp scampi, roasted chicken and asparagus,  caramelized pears and butter...sugar and butter) are such high quality ingredients that the finished product is just amazing. So, we have laid off the crepes for a day now but I can already see more in the next few days while we are here.
4 Well, for an $11-12 crepe it better be good...and it was.  I got the Banana Nutella crepe and it was delicious.  Now, I would think twice about spending that type of money on a crepe but hey, either spend the money and get something that leaves a good taste in your mouth or go throw it away on the slots, which certainly won't leave a good taste.    La Creperie is located just beyond the casino, back in the shopping area - not too far in.
5 We were visiting friends staying at Paris and wanted a quick take out brunch to eat in the nearby sport's bar while watching the football game.  I'm not sure if that was allowed, so I don't want to recommend this,  but no one said anything to us.  Maybe because we were ordering large quantities of alcohol.  I walked around the various shops and saw that this place not only made dessert crepes, but lunch ones also.  I had the ham and cheese crepe, while my husband had the roasted chicken crepe.  We shared our orders and both were delicious.  I really wanted to try the Nutella crepes for dessert, but they were so huge, I couldn't have another bite.  I will save that for our next visit to Vegas, that's for sure.
3 If i were to compare the other crepes restaurant that ive been to,i can say that i had far much better than the one i had in here,its good but for the amount that i paid its not worth it
4 I stopped here because I was hungry and a burger sounded good.  Well the burger was good and the petite fries were awesome. Plus they have a good happy hour.  Kristie my waitress in the bar section was knowledgeable about the beer selections. She gave great recommendations. It is a bit loud but it is a sports bar.
2 This used to be one of my go-to places when I came to Vegas. I had been eating crepes here as far back as 2003.  I would have definitely given 5 Stars. Unfortunately they changed their menu within the last year or two. (Last time I was here was 05/2013) They no longer have the Fruits de Mer (savoury seafood,mozzarella/ mushroom crepe w/ bechamel sauce). It has been replaced with a subpar shrimp scampi crepe. They also replaced their pear/walnut/almond/Chantilly cream crepe with a pear/hazlenut/maple syrup/golden raisin crepe. Also subpar....the flavors just don't go together as well as the former. The raisins are very overpowering. Not to mention the size of the crepes has shrank significantly as well, while the price has increased. :( I guess the consolation is that it is still entertaining to watch the crepe being made. :/  There used to always be a super long line, no matter what time of day. Last couple times I came during lunch (11-2ish), and there was only me and one or two other people. I sadly will probably never come back....unless they bring back the Fruits de Mer! That was the best crepe I have ever eaten! ^__^  Always the optimist, I will pass by next time and glance at the menu, fingers crossed hoping that they bring back the old menu...
4 Expertly cooked crepes, reasonably priced (for the Vegas strip) and a good way to start your day. Coffee is adequate, service is counter-style, so you have to linger while they cook. Note that the creperie is a sideline of the larger Le Provençal restaurant and not shown on Paris Casino map displays and shares a seating area with La Boulangerie.
4 5 stars for food. 3 stars for the service and preparation. Great breakfast option if you have less that 30 minutes and your already staying at the Paris hotel where is located. We tried the 3 cheese and the Nutella, the Nutella was so amazing I could have ordered 3 more if there was room in my stomach. Good prices for Vegas and they offer a Total Rewards card discount. Would also make a great late night snack, think they were open till midnight.
5 I won't wait in a line, anywhere. Waiting in line is not a good look. I make an exception for this place. One of the most reasonably priced places to eat in all of Vegas. They are consistently good. When in Vegas I have a crepe for breakfast, and another for a midnight snack.  Tips from a regular.....   - They stop taking orders about 15 minutes before they close. So if when they close at 11 pm, you need to be in line by 10:45 pm.   -  Order the combo. No matter the crepe's price, if you order a combo, you get the crepe and drink for 10.99. Depending on the time of year, the combo might be 9.99. The combo is a better deal than the rewards price.    - If you get a soft drink or coffee, just ask for your drink cup, then go next door to JJ's Boulangerie, for your drink. The crepe window is part of JJ's, and inside JJ's they have a larger selection of soft drinks and teas.
2 When we came the first time we were told we would have to wait 30 min so we left. However, when we passed by 10 min later the place seemed to be working again.  We ordered 2 crepes. One was barely warm, the other was cold inside so we had to ask to make it again. To make things worse, the supposedly vegetarian tomato mozzarella crepe had pieces of ham in it!  If you want a crepe, do yourself a favor and go to Jean Philippe Patisserie in Bellagio just across the road - it's INFINITELY better!
4 This review is only for the crepe I had...it definitely satisfied my crepe-craving and sweet tooth! It had nutella, whipped cream, caramel, chocolate sauce, bananas, and candied hazelnuts. There is no possible way to have a bad day in Vegas when you start off breakfast like this ;)
4 I had the berry crepe here and loved it!  The crepe was nicely made with think layers and some cripsness to it, the berries were awesome as was the creme fraiche.  Delicious combination.  Would definitely be back for more, if not for the price ($12!).
5 Hands down the best crepe I've ever had! On my visit to Vegas so far I've been here twice and both times I've been extremely satisfied. They serve dessert crepes as well as savory crepes. I've tried a dessert crepe (Nutella) and a savory one (Ham and Cheese) both very yummy.
4 DROOOL worthy (soft) crepes. I tried the shrimp scampi with spinach and the blueberry lemon curd crepe for a taste of both sweet and savory types. Highly recommended. It's fun watching the guy in the back make them, too. Prices are a little high, but it is Vegas afterall. (~$12)
4 If you're looking for a cheap, quick bite on the strip, this is a place you would hit up.   My friends and I were looking to have a snack during our 1.5+ hour wait for Bacchanal Buffet and La Creperie was perfect: simple and easy to share. We ordered two Roasted Chicken ($11.00) which consisted of rotisserie chicken, sun dried tomatoes, asparagus, basil pesto & shaved grana padano.   Overall verdict: pretty good.   The crepe batter itself was a little sweeter than I would've liked it, the tomatoes had a weird texture to them and the basil pesto could have used a little more "umph", but overall, not bad for a snack.   It was a definite plus that there were plenty of seating arrangements around and that water cups were free of charge. Yay!   Keep quality expectations low, price expectations high, and you'll be fine in the City of Sin.
4 Loved this.  Look at the photos!  Crepes were not overly sweet and were very tasty.  I had the apple, and my wife had the pear.  Great for a quick snack.  Tables are off to the side in a little common area, and we had no trouble finding one.
3 I loooooove crepes!! sweet or savory, I'm a fan.....and these were delicious!  The presentation was a little cheap (plastic plate & plastic forks) and they were way over-priced at about $11 each (its Vegas)...but they were very tasty and fast.
5 I love crepes! And this place was my first good luck in Vegas!   I ordered a roasted chicken crepe, but there was a bit a line and my order was delayed. So the sweet chief made me an apology dessert crepe. Awesome!!!!   Then wow! Both were delicious!  You are going to enjoy it if you pass this place next time you are in Paris, Vegas.
5 Our crepe was awesomely delicious. And that's coming from someone who generally avoids junk food altogether. After the first bite my husband and I agreed we need to come back to La Creperie the next time we're in Vegas.
4 I ordered the Nutella Crepe and felt like I was back in Paris at a cafe next to the Notre Dame. It was so good and a great way to start my morning.  My friend had one of the savory crepes and loved it. Get a total rewards card. Even gold members get a discounted price!
3 I needed a last-minute place to grab breakfast, and this place offered a quick bite. I had the ham and gruyere cheese crepe (with bechamel sauce on top) and a bottle of water -- and it came out to more than $16.   Definitely do not order a bottle of water for $3.50 when you can get it cheaper at the other places inside Paris -- even saw it for $1. If I had gotten coffee instead, it would've been $6 cheaper? I don't get that.  The whole French cafe vibe is crushed when you're served cafeteria style. If it's a cheap place, fine, but this isn't cheap. The crepes did come out super quick, but the cafe was slow around 8 a.m. Saturday.  The crepe itself, yes I got the savory, was way too salty. Can they do half savory and half sweet? Because they should.
4 Every time we come to vegas regardless of where we are staying we have to come to the creperie and get our fix for crepes. This year we stayed at the Paris so it was crepes every night.   I love Nutella and of course have to get the Nutella and banana crepes. My only complaint........get rid of the cool whip.
5 Incroyable ! This chicken crepe is bananas delicious. I feel like I'm eating at a world class spot, just off of a plastic plate with plastic utensils. The price isn't bad at all for the value, $11.25 is the median price per crepe.  Five stars for real real. Go. Without hesitation. But yeah, like another reviewer suggested, buy your water or drink elsewhere and bring it in if you don't want to pay airport drink prices.
5 This places is awesome. My sister, My grandma and I were waiting for our guest to arrive here, and while waiting we enjoyed the garlic fries, crepe vendome(?) (which was AMAZING, who knew apples and chicken tasted so good) we had a fruit plate and croissants, sipped on hot chocolate while my grandma and sister drank mimosas. Once our guest arrived we placed our orders with our fabulous waitress and shortly after our food came. Don't remember what my grandma ordered but it was a delicious looking crepe. My sister had the healthy start crepe which she greatly enjoyed, It was a sweet crepe with yogurt, strawberries, bananas, toasted almonds and topped with honey(:  David our guest, had the croissant breakfast sandwich. I had the Belgium waffles with strawberries and cream, maple syrup, and nutella. It was phenomenal. I definitely recommend this place(: food was totally worth the wait, but some items on the menu were a wee pricey,  for example the fruit and cheese sampler was 10 bucks. Yikes!!  But nonetheless this place was amazing and I would highly recommend La Creperie to everyone(:
4 My first encounter with some of La Creperie's crapes was unfortunate!   Unfortunate that I had chosen to get a sandwich next door, and was only tasting deliciousness off others plates! No one was able to  finish so consider sharing (with me).
5 Discovered this place a few trips ago. Just want to say the crepes are amazing, fast and reasonably priced. Great for breakfast or lunch, heck even supper! Often times I don't eat much in Vegas, between the snacking and the drinking finding a convenient good meal is often tough. This place is a great go to place to have in your back pocket. Assuming I remember where it as after a good number of Bloody Mary's. Try it, enjoy it. I highly recommend this little gem!
4 Expensive and really long wait time but the crepes were worth it.
3 This was my third visit and while the Crepes were as good as I remembered, the service was terrible. There were three women working and they appeared to not really care  how long the line was or if they gave you the wrong food. One of the cooks roiled her eyes at the customer who said the crepe was not the one he ordered and he wanted what he ordered.   $25 for two Crepes, ham and cheese and chicken. Chicken one was a surprise to be as good as it was.   We could easily have shared one and i was pretty hungry.    I would definitely order again and only giving three stars due to the service.
5 My all time favorite crepes.Find them at Paris Casino, Las Vegas. Try the nuttela one.....
3 Ate a roasted chicken with pesto crepe. Didn't feel like dessert for the first meal of the day and I wanted something that wasn't too cheesy. This crepe was mediocre. Couldn't finish it cause it started tasting weird in my mouth. Friends got ham & cheese and nutella. They seemed to enjoy theirs. I didn't try it.  They have a meal deal of crepe + soda/coffee for $10.99 which is pretty good considering most of the crepes are more than this by themselves. They also charge 50 cents for a cup of water, which you get next door at the pizza place.  Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.
2 Was not super impressed. My favorite thing in the whole world is a delicious crêpe. I just love them. My husband and I made it a point to stop in and have a delicious crêpe while visiting in Las Vegas. I don't know if that was this particular day or what it was but they were very expensive and definitely not worth the trouble we had to go through to have a HARD yet enormously chewy gummy unsatisfying crêpe with berries and whipped cream. I have to say the berries were better than the crêpe for sure. So if you want a handful of delicious berries you can find them here just exclude the crêpe :(
3 I'm a local and I went here twice for just butter and sugar crepes, despite that it's overpriced especially for such a simple one.  The first one I got was great and the line moved quickly.  They had put creme on it which was delicious, even though at first I thought I wouldn't want it.  When I came back the next day they were understaffed and the guy making the crepes was moving ridiculously slowly, almost everyone was whining about it.  When I finally got my crepe I figured who cares about the 15 minute standing wait because it's worth it... It came out without the creme and I asked the cashier if they could put it on because they did earlier and she said no because it wasn't on the menu, which it wasn't.  So I don't know.  The first crepe was much better, the second one just had all the raw sugar and butter in one spot and it was too crispy in that area, honestly I didn't even enjoy eating that section but I was hungry.
5 Really good crapes got the dessert and lunch. The Nutella banana was to rich for my taste but good wish I had milk with it. And the cheese and ham and the roasted chicken were great as well they might not seem filling but they were. Recommend this place to all my friends
2 This place used to be sooo good!  I would dream about these crepes all year (we have been going on an annual girls trip since 2001).  Then they decided to change the menu a year or two ago.  The Fruits De Mer crepe was hands down the best crepe I've had.  They replaced it with a shrimp scampi one that was bland and sadly fell short.  We were so excited that we had finally gotten to go without waiting in a massive line up.  It didn't take long to figure out why!  I would rush back there in a second if they brought back the old menu, but unless that happens, I will continue to pine for the day when they were so much better!
3 solid 3.5 stars, good to have sweet or savoury crepes as it's compatible any time of day if u think about it but i digress.  ordered the Banana Fosters, without any Nutella for once, instead a rum whipped cream, yummy.  same for the ham and cheese, and for almost $11, well worth the quantity of meat.  plus a cream sauce, sprinkled with some sprouts.  but the texture of crepe made nice too.  if u r in a rush, wasnt worth the 15min wait 11:30am lol
3 Tried the shrimp scampi and it was pretty good. Saw him making a butter and sugar one topped with berries and chantilly cream that loooked good. Minus one star for register girl and cook chatting half the time and taking over twenty minutes to get the food out even though there were only a few orders before me.
