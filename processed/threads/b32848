5 My wonderful PA sent me here to get my back X-Rayed, and lemme tell you the receptionist is a hoot! The wait was short, you walk in, grab a number and sit your booty in a chair and wait to be called. I figured I'd be waiting a hot minute, but I literally waited a hot minute!  I went to the receptionist and we started talking, she was such a sweet heart and took my humor like a champ! Now normally you get some stuck up ppl, especially at 9am, but she wasnt! I had her laughing and she said thanks for starting her day out great : ) I wrote a stellar review for you Miss Deborah!  I sat back down and waited for my name to be called. The waiting area is semi big, has a TV and a nice selection of magazines. I almost grabbed the People Magazine when I heard my name. There was probably around 20 people waiting so I was shocked it was this quick! I went back with my X-Ray tech and she asked if I had any metal on my pants (I laughed bc I was wearing leggings) and I said no with a smile. She told me the norm: Take off your bra and shirt, put the gown on and lay on the table.  I loved that the gown actually fit and before I knew it my x-rays were done!!  Overall I had a wonderful experience here and will def go back if I need to : )
1 Sucks.   Filthy dirty.  Unprofessional   Tell your doctor.   Tell your insurance company  to stop using this grease pit.  This is not health care, this is lack of health care
1 Way more expensive that an other place I finally went to, Desert Radiologists was going to charge me close to 3 TIMES what the other place charged me, same insurance same Xrays!!! Shop around with your insurance help.
