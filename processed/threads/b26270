4 Clean building and friendly staff. Food is Taco Bell quality. Not bad, not good. I would go back there if I got the munchies for a Taco Bell chicken burrito again :)
4 perfect drunk/hangover food.... I mean it's taco bell people!! I love their mexican pizzas and cinnamon twists.... The staff is great and never mess up our order :D (not that we go all the time) lol
5 The staff here is always friendly.  There's a sign on the wall saying it's a certified training facility, and they do a wonderful job.  Sadly I've never seen customer service like this at another TB around the valley.  Order is ALWAYS correct and I order some complicated, add this take this off, they always get it right.  While here on this trip I noticed that the 'large' cups that come with the meal have shrunk!  Fountain Mt Dew is one of my guilty pleasures and when I go for TB it's a double treat, I was a bit saddened but realize I sure don't need the bit of dew I was missing!
4 Your average run of the mill taco bell here folks....food quality is what you would expect from a fast food mexican food restaurant and the inside of the place is nice and clean and a decent environment as well
2 TBell like every other about 50% of the time service can be real slow though.
1 No Senior Discount.  Small drink  .25 . Supposed to be free.
1 Worst service of any fast food EVER... More like SLOW COLD FOOD or NO Food. & it's what's worse- employees tonight were rude, manager on duty spoke no English. Ridiculous. Thought I'd give this location one last try, even though I had another bad experience there this past Sunday when they CLOSED DOORS & drive thru after I had been sitting in drive thru for literally 15 minutes.
