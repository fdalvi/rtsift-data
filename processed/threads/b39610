5 Very nice people. It's a family owned shop, a bit small but new and clean. They have a really nice selection of flavors. The largest size they have is a 32 oz. too big for my taste so I got the medium almond boba tea. Pretty solid. Not too sweet, boba nice and chewy. Would recommend.
5 Got a hot Almond milk tea. Absolutely delicious. Very friendly owners and clean environment. Highly recommended to give them a shot :)
5 Plenty of flavors, i think 63. Family owned business  Clean business Service is always great, they are pleasant and try to encourage you to come back.
5 This mom and pop is the best thing ever. I live around the corner and come here every day after the gym. The fruit is always fresh and they're  very flexible with anything you want. Prices are good and the drinks are always refreshing
3 The lady who completed her order before the person in front me decided she wanted popping pearls in her drink.  This woman was determined to get her popping pearls. The owner's wife let her cut in front of me to change her order and order more. Once she got around to taking my order, the owners wife couldnt crack a smile and was quick to take my larger bill before I could give her my change.  She rolled her eyes as if my business wasn't important. Boba drinks here are good, however, service is not good enough for me to come back.
5 Pros:  opens up earlier than most boba places - 10:30am on Sunday is great in my book.  They use fresh fruit in their smoothies.  We have their coconut mango, strawberry and banana smoothies, all freshly made with real fruit.  Their boba was cooked perfectly.  Nice, friendly service, and family owned.  They also give out a stamp card for a free boba drink when you fill up the card.   Cons:  None  We're looking forward to coming back soon.
