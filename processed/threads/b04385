4 I had been needing a battery for quite some time for a portable phone in the shop.  This morning my fob for the car quit working.  After figuring out how to take it apart to get the battery number it started working better than it had in weeks.  I needed some help getting the correct phone battery.  After that I questioned the sales person about my car fob and she knew just what the problem was and charged me a whole dollar to resolder the battery tab.  They have an incredible assortment of specialized batteries in stock.  And friendly staff that knows their stuff.
5 I'm very pleased with my experience at this Batteries Plus.  I needed a new battery in my remote alarm/key on my 04 Honda.  It was dead.  I dropped into this store on a Friday afternoon.  A couple people were in the store and I had to wait few minutes for someone to help me, he opened my key, replaced the battery and checked that it worked.  It took maybe 5 minutes and only $4.15, and I was back on the road happy as a clam. Again, I'm very pleased with these guys.
5 They had every battery I needed.   I had 5 different kinds to get replaced.  Service was knowledgeable and friendly!  I'll be back again.
1 Just came in. Two people in front of me. Waited. Someone else came in. Large man appears from behind counter, moves to help the people who came in after me. I said "Need a ..." but the people who came on after me were served first. I have bought Iphone batteries, watch batteries here but my next order will be online.
