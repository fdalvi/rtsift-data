4 Sicily's Pizza is my go to place if I want delivery because it's 24 hours. If I'm craving their Hawaiian Pizza (which I usually am) then I can get it delivered at 3am if wanted. I usually will not order anything with ham on it because it's just too salty... but the ham they put on this pizza is more sweet than anything. They also offer Buffalo Wings, Cheesecake with Strawberry, Bread sticks with cheese, Chicken Caesar Salad, Meat Calzone, Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken etc. I've only tried the pizza and the cheesy bread sticks which I can say tastes good on a lazy night in!
3 Good pizza, okay service. I saw a sign for a $4.99 two slice and a soda special so I decided to stop in. This is a take-it-to-go pizza shop with no place to dine in. The pizza was good but very stringy-cheesy and since I had to eat my slices in the car, very messy.   I recommend skipping this place and going to Villa Pizza instead. It's walking distance from Sicily's and they have a $6.49 all-you-can-eat pizza, pasta, salad, and garlic knots special. (And their food is delicious!)
3 When I was a young lad I had my fair share working at sub par pizza parlors which helps me conclude Sicily's is equal to something around the qualities of Domino's.  The biggest pros for Sicily's is that it is 24 hours (I'm not 100% sure, they claim it, and I have ordered something 3am in the morning), they're a small business (yay), they deliver, and.. they always have some promotion where you can snag something from them for cheap.   Today I recall seeing two cheese slices and a soda for $4.99 which is great if you're looking for a quick meal during your lunch break. I recall a few times I've ordered a XL pizza for something around $6.99, thats crazy cheap. They pizza is also decent, medium crust, crispy,  they do not skimp out on the toppings, but you gotta eat it quick or else you'll face the dreaded soggy pizza (probably from having too many toppings). Their meat calzone is tasty, but also suffers from soggy syndrome if you wait too long.  They also serve pasta, cheesecake, buffalo wings, breadsticks, and salads.
1 pizza is the same as any other pizza shop. the customer service is absolutely horrible. these guys have false advertising. i went in the shop expecting a $7.99 XL pizza as advertised but instead the worker said $17.99 i was already there so i decided to pay for it. it was supposed to come with wings but the guy said i have to order free wings when i order. who do they think they are? DO NOT COME HERE
5 Really good pizza
4 I'm totally new to Vegas and it was 1:30 am.  I hadn't had anything to eat all day so I wanted pizza to fill me up.  Called to place an order but didn't have a menu.  Cell phone dropped call.  Called again.  Drove to pickup the pizza and went to the wrong place.  Called again.  And then I told them it was the web's fault.  (Opps, it was my bad after all.) These guys are so patient.  Not a sarcastic tone or anything.  Really pleasant to talk to.  And then the pizza.  I cannot ever make up my mind so I ordered two.  Can always put it in the fridge or freezer for other times. Had a piece of each. The spinach with feta, mushrooms, cheese and garlic-butter sauce was heavenly and the meatball and mushroom pizza with marinara was to die for. Both pies had just the right amount of each ingredient.  The crust was the perfect balance of crisp and dough.    It may not be the closest pizza joint to where I live, but they have my business no matter what the hour.
3 I received a flyer in my door one day that advertised 2 medium pizzas, any way that I like them, for $11.99. Sweet! I ordered my usuals but one with stuffed crust (no extra charge because of the coupon) & one regular. If I had to choose only one word to describe the pizzas, it would be: alright. I enjoyed the taste of the cheese but it was the type that's all in one piece so it's prone to doing the pizza landslide where everything falls off in one bite.   The toppings were quality, and as Susan I. said, the ham is savory and delicious, unfortunately, the crusts didn't match up. I'm a sucker for stuffed crust from Pizza Hut where it has cheese oozing out and you can't see the other end, but this one clearly had a disappointing light at the end of it's tunnel. This crust also seemed to be thinner on the rest of the pizza so it got soggy before I even took my first bite. On the original crust, the center of the pizza was good but the crust was almost like a pizza from the freezer aisle.   The people who worked there were really welcoming and their promotions are a great bargain if you're just looking for something to fill you up.   P.S. There is now one table situated outside for those who want to dine in.
4 I went in n ordered 2 lrg pizzas for $16, n it was ready in 15mins! They were friendly, fast n pizza was good! The crust is similar to pizza hut but not nearly as oily, n they put a good amount of cheese on there. The best so far is Garlic Chicken, u have to try it, frickn awesome...one problem is pizza runs a lil small compared to other Italian pizzerias, the small is like a personal size, medium is a small, large is medium size n x-large looks like a basic large size. So of u r hungry n have to share be sure to order an X-large!
3 I've been to many places in vegas for pizza.. but have never been able to find a great combination. Low and behold I finally have. Whoopie!  Finally a fantastic pizza place that service p, fast pizza.  We got 2 large pizza'a for 11.99. WOW! It was ready in less than 20 minutes as well. They have awesome pizza deal (carryout) and when we got there, 3 other customers were there to pick up their orders as well. There was a young guy (21), old man (50's) and another family type guy (late 30's) which is a great sign. The owner was fast, friendly and apologized for taking so long (i was like whaaaaat? not even!) You can tell they are very nice to talk to and really care about their business.  When we ate it i was surprised about how tasty it was. Totally unexpected.  Cheap being tasty? Unheard of! None greasy. Large slices. He even gave us stuffed crust for no extra charge. Super cheesy. Good amount of toppings.  Attention; dont use their website, it doesnt work. but thats not a big deal to me.. i know to others its just horrid (gasp) NOT! get over yourself.a  We also tried the mozzorella sticks... NASTY! Its just big hunks of cold cheese. YUCK! We also got the wings. They were good but not my style. Heads up wing people, they bake theirs. NOT FRIED! I took off 2 stars just for these 2 reasons.  Coming to the conclusion that this is a PIZZA ONLY place. Don't get anything else.
2 i agree with other yelpers - only order pizza here. the baked lasagna and spaghetti is horrible . i tried this place 3 times and i will never go back. the owner is really nasty to you if you present a Groupon. he gripes that he does not make any money on those. umm... hello? go talk to Groupon! i just order and deliver the food for several disabled/seniors around my neighborhood. i thought this was a local friendly place so started giving them some business . forget it. the food is mediocre. the calzone does get soggy if you wait too long to eat it. the veggie pizza does have lots of fresh veggies on it and they prep it super fast. note to others: IT IS NOT 24 HOURS!!!  as of October 2011, they are open from 11am until 3am. i arrived late from an overseas flight and tried to order at 5am and they were closed.
4 I only learned about this place from a flyer left on my door.  After a particularly long day, I had no desire to cook dinner so I took a look at the flyer.  The prices were pretty decent but the coupon for 2 mediums any way I want for only $11.99 looked perfect.  When I called to place my order, the girl was very friendly and answered my questions without any attitude (not an easy thing to come across in Vegas).  The man who delivered the pizzas was very friendly as well.  I hoped the pizzas were as good as the service....and let me just say, they were better!!  Oh my goodness....the crust was perfect...crispy on the outside and hot and doughy on the inside.  The sauce had good flavor and there wasn't too much of it.  The cheese and all the toppings were fresh and delicious.  I have finally found a great pizza place in Vegas.....it has only taken almost 9 years LOL
3 The food is pretty basic.  This is not a place really made for dining in there's a large table a little space inside and theirs barely any room to have 2 people walk around inside. Service was quick and friendly. They're open and delivery 24hrs a day. So that's cool. They have some good pizza deals. Prices were OK for about $20 I got a large one topping pizza, mozzarella sticks and bread sticks.
1 I ordered one small pizza and one medium pizza directly off their menu with no special additions.  That is not what was delivered to my door.  This was late on a monday night too. Not like some busy weekend rush or dinner hour to get in the way.    The real frustration came in trying to fix the order. After calling the place three times, I was put on hold, hung up on, unable to talk to the same person twice, major communication issues, and not once offered an apology or way to fix this.  They really need to work on the customer service. Over two hours later I was left with two small pizzas totaling $ 35.  While I can't vouch for the actual taste of the pizza since I ended up with plain cheese, the service sucks.  This place just lost my business. Not worth the hassle.  I wish the best of luck to the rest of you!
3 Bought the groupon today, $10 for $5.  Pros: two italian guys cooking, prices good, food generally good  Cons: Bought the groupon, but only had online to go off of to order, online site messed up and prices/offerings are very different than the actual menu. Example: quoted $14 for a large pizza, but found out I could have got one for $7 if I had an actual menu. Prices online are more expensive than the actual cost. Pricing very sketchy.  Mushrooms on pizza clearly from a can??? Not sure.    Overall, not bad, but not good.  Especially given the 500 other pizza places to eat at in the city.
2 Order loads of food for multiple people at work. After an hour of waiting, we called back and were told that they "forgot to put in the order". They were nice enough to give us a small discount and upgrade some sizes of food. which would have been great but honestly with the quality of the food i could have done with a much smaller portion.  Calzone - canned mushrooms??? That is never okay! Greek french fries w/ feta - why call them "Greek french fries w/ feta"? All I got was microwaved french fries with a pile of mediocre feta cheese, guess I assumed there would be some sort of seasoning. Chicken fingers(BBQ) - Drenched in BBQ sauce, how bout a side instead of pouring a jar of BBQ sauce onto tiny chicken fingers. Fettuccine Alfredo - Why were the noodles stuck together? You know what, I don't want to know. Buffalo chicken wings - I thought they should be crispy, wrong again.
1 So, i've been getting Sicily's Pizza flyers stuffed in the crevices of my door for the last few months and I thought hey a "24 hour delivery" pizza place, i'll keep this flyer handy  when i'm craving some pizza!!  So, i just get off work at 4am and I get a sudden hankering for a slice...  So, I order online because the flyer says I can get 20% off an online order.  So, I place my order and wait about 40 min.  Just to be sure they had gotten my order, I call the number and the lady on the phone says there is no 24 hour delivery in this location.   Come to find out there are like 10 locations of this place, most of which are in Alaska and the las vegas number I called was "dispatched" to a call center??? in Alaska.  I don't know who runs the Vegas location, but you guys need to stop printing out false advertising!!  And of all places, the location in Vegas ISN'T 24 hours????  This is the city that never sleeps, they should be 24 hrs!!!! And their main website doesn't even have the Vegas location on there!!!   I would have loved to try the pizza here, but now i'm over it!! Ughhh   Get your information straight!!!
5 Great pizza in an unexpected place. Recommended by one of my best friends, this joint has some of the best pizzas and value prices. You can order a $7 large pizza with Canadian bacon and you will get a quality pizza with an amazing flavor, unlike the cardboard tasting stuff you get at the other fast food chains.   This place is open 24 hours and the owner is always there to greet you when you drop by to pick up your pie and gives you deals on drinks or dipping sauces if you are a regular at his place. Oh, and speaking of dipping sauces, make sure you get some BBQ wings to dip in ranch!
5 This place is great ! The pizza is awesome and the prices r t prices on Little Ceasars.. Really good pizza. I would highly recommend !! X large pizza under $10
1 So I was craving wings n ordered a10piece well done light sauce and a ceaser salad. $17 delivery plus tip and 45-60 min delivery. Fine. the Guy showed up in 20min and the wings were under cooked  microwave BS I can't believe it. I will never order from here again!!!! Had to cook my wings in toaster oven for 20 min on 350. WTF. Seriously.
5 24/7 pizza delivery!!! Need I say more? I've had pizza here a few times and just revisited recently. How could I forget about this majestic hole-in-the-wall spot? I figure because I'd only get pizza after getting loaded at the PT's close by. Nonetheless, after seeing a Living Social deal for $7 for $14 worth of food, I was back on the wagon. While I remembered the pizza being delicious, I was kinda bummed that the deal excluded pizza. So I opted out for calzones. These babies were huge! Think 4 big slices of pizza with another pizza fold on top of it and you have their calzones. My man and I got 2 calzones, which was the prefect amount for the LS deal. He got the meat and I got the veggie calzone. I finished two of those deliciously cheesy and veggie stuffed pies and I was spent.   Just to be clear, this isn't a restaurant or sit down restaurant. You come, you order and you leave happy, because you just got pizza or a yummy calzone.   The guys behind the counter were super nice as well. So ultimately, if you are feigning for pizza and you're too lazy to get off your bum, call these guys! Your stomach and taste buds will thank me later.
5 So I got home last night and was craving something to eat. I didn't have much in the house because I hadn't been to the store in awhile.  I did a search for "delivery" on Yelp to see what would turn up. Lo and behold I discovered this place was fairly close to me and I'd never tried it.  So having had a few beers and few shots of tequila I figured what the hell I'll give it a try.   I ordered a Hawaiian Pizza a order of wings and a bottle of Pepsi. The food was at my door quicker than any delivery I've ever had!  I'm very picky about wings. Most places seem way under cooked for my taste. These wings were great. My only complaint was they had just a bit two much sauce on them. I'd probably strain them next time just to let a bit of it drip off. But they were really tasty!  The pizza was great! So good in fact this is gonna be my new pizza place to order from.  I only ordered a medium one last night as it was the first time I'd ordered from them. It was so good last night that I ordered a large one for breakfast LOL seriously. I'm typing this as I await it's arrival. I'm just waiting to hit the post button until it arrives in case they're slower this time.  Yep...very fast again. I'm off to have breakfast   :-)
3 This is the typical late night pizza to munch on when you're not sober.  They're not exactly open 24 hours but close enough.  We got a half and half of Hawaiian and Margherita.  That sounded a heck of a lot better after a few drinks but now sounds ridiculous as I type this.    The Hawaiian side touted double Canadian bacon, double cheese and double pineapple.  Everything was doubled but the bacon.  The Margherita side was just a cheese pizza with basil and sliced tomato slapped on the top.  The cheese was also burnt on that side due to the fact that the Hawaiian side took longer to cook.  I blame myself.    You should ask for a takeout menu before you order because they have coupons you can use right on the spot like 2 x-large (which is actually just a large) pizzas any way you want them for a little less then $18.
5 Pretty good pizza very fresh I want to give four but my husband says five so its five the only reason being I felt they play tricks telling you 12 chicken strips 4.99 (but when it sound to good right?!!) it was lol it was like three full chicken strips cut into four but on the flip hand they got me toche!! ill be back................but the price is always reasonable I have to say!
1 Don't come here if you're hungry. Pizza  quality is nothing special. Better off going to a typical place like Pizza Hut or Round Table.
1 Don't know why there are so many good reviews but this place had the most disgusting wings and mozzarella sticks I've ever had. The mozzarella wasn't even completely fried, still looked pale. Took one bite and was grossed out. The wings were swimming in grease which they called their hot sauce. I'm not very picky but this was probably one of the worst meals I've ever had in my life.
2 Everything about this place seemed a little shady. Advertised 24 hrs but not. Advertisement and pizza box specifically says 24hrs. Cook says those are old. Ad came out last week though. Order goes to call center apparently.  Ordered 2 xl pizzas, came to pickup, and they were not even started yet. Cook says my number was invalid from his records based on another customer name Adam (really uncommon name I guess)'so he decided he wasn't going to fulfill the order. They didnt even ask for a number when ordering so How incredibly dumb and lazy can he be? So had to wait while 6 hungry kids await at home (not all my kids) Pizza was average, a little dough-y and salty. Cheap yes, but Plenty of other great pizza options. Avoid.
4 This is probably my favorite pizza place to go in Vegas, and my favorite all around late night hit spot. The Gyro Pizza is AMAZING. I have to say though... prob skip the deserts/appetizers... not the best. Sicily's will definitely be supplying the pizza at all my future parties :)
1 I ordered the extra cheese and extra pepperoni pizza. Don't do it. It was a joke. It came out to be one of those pizzas with barely any cheese and barely any pepperoni and was a waste of money. I hate places like this!!
1 Let me begin by saying in the business of food guidelines should be set and not changed on a case by case basis......with that said,let's continue.one, online it says minimum is 12 bucks,fine. However, when they force you to order more there is a problem.two, placing an order shouldn't take twenty minutes through a basic call center. Then when you ask to speak to a manager they don't put you in contact with them. Food should not be an argument,I'm putting money in your pocket to put food in my belly....this place is rediculous and a joke.....never order from them; period. Update, got my food and it also tasted as bad as the service called back there times to try to rectify the entire situation with no avail.the management  is  incredibly rude and fixed nothing.shame
1 I have ordered from great places and I have ordered from crappy places. This place definitely makes the crap list.   I ordered a pizza and sandwich around 6pm. I have the confirmation and everything, its good to go. Well at 7pm hits and there is still no pizza. I call and I am told they mixed my order with someone else's and I would have to wait an additional 45 mins. Well at 830pm comes and there is still no pizza. I call back and they tell me the order never made it out of the kitchen and they would have to remake it. They told me they would take 30% off if I was ok with waiting another 45 mins. I told them no thanks and they then offered me 40% off. Again, I said no thanks, and then they proceeded to hang up on me like I was the one that messed up.   I used to work in the restaurant business. If someone waited 2 Hours and 30 mins for food that never came and then was asked to wait another 45 mins, it better be free. Sicilys Pizza obviously do not care about their customers.
1 Bummed. I ordered 2 times from this place. First time, doughy crust. Gave it another try last night. Both my daughter and i are lactose intolerant. Ordered 1 pizza no cheese. Of course when they arrived it was wrong. Called back from my phone, got put on hold for over 20 minutes. Called from my wifes phone got right through. Caller said i'll send a new pizza. Waited 2 hours and pizza never showed. Fell asleep it was only 2 am by this point. Called back the following day and the "manager" said yea supreme pizza? Everything is right. (Giving me the run around) I said i'll come down there and prove it. Brought the reciept and got money thrown at me for being right. Do not order pizza or food from this place. At this point ill order from corperate places. At least i can call and they will make it right even if its under ten bucks.
1 Worst customer service, cheap owners, & will not compromise for their Groupon buyers, false advertisements 24/7. Doors closes at midnight even tho it's stated 24/7. Product doesn't smell or taste fresh. Menu changes constantly. & prices go up every single month. WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS PIZZA PLACE TO ANYONE...go to NAPOLI Pizzeria #1 Spot In Vegas
4 So I read some of the reviews and was a little scared but car wasn't running and I had a house full of boys and low on funds so I ordered from here. This was a great choice. I got 2XL pizzas for $20 anyway I wanted. Everyone loved it. I didn't like that I asked for extra cheese and didn't get it but other than that the pizza was delicious. Would definitely order from here again.
4 Yes the crust is doughy (but I like soft bread) and Yes the people seem unprofessional, borderline obnoxious. I questioned my choice to come here on a drive-by whim. I was relieved to see the "A" rating from the health district on the wall while I waited for my $5 medium pizza.  Honestly...I didn't want to like it, but it was DELICIOUS for my tastebuds. I am so embarrassed to admit I ate half my pizza, when I only intended to eat a Slice. I would get pizza here again, as long as they maintain the "A"!
3 the service is crappy,people are cheap,but if you want really good pizza at a great price,this is the place get it.the wings,way to spicy,and to much sauce,bread,yuck.so if you're in the mood for just pizza order here
1 Worst spaghetti I've ever had, and very little of it too. Will never order from them again! Rip off.
5 24 hour service!  702-333-8000Exceptional chicken fettuccine Alfredo! White pizza is to die for!!! Everything is homemade I love it. 24hr delivery and pick up. The owner is super friendly!!! 5 stars!!!!!
3 I had this a couple weeks ago late at night, it wasn't bad for $8 for an XL with ground beef. The fact that it is 24 hours is always a good thing.
3 So last night - okay - EARLY this morning, I had a pizza craving.  And of course, there are very few late night delivery services. But in my searches, I found this joint. Orders at 230am and arrived at 340am. That was fine with me, because it was actually a distance from my home.  I ordered a large pepperoni thin crust and "mozzarella cheese sticks". The pie was actually really good - bit on the cool side due to the distance but nonetheless, pretty good pie.  I would order it again.  The cheese sticks?? Not so much. Half cooked, clearly microwaved nastiness. Needless to say, I didn't eat those.  The delivery driver was friendly, the service pretty good, pizza VERY good but I would stop at that.
1 me and my family visit Vegas every so often and we love the food there great city but this was the worst customer service experience we have ever had with any type of restaurant the owner's attitude was not very great bad temper and for the price we paid for not worth it we wont be eating there again and will be telling all my family and friends to do so if it was possible to give 0 stars i would
1 If I am able to give zero stars I would.     First of all the Management and delivery staff are RUDE!  The delivery guy sat in from of my office for 10 minutes with our food in his car before he came into our door.    Secondly, we ordered "Sandwich's."  Their definition of a Sandwich and mine are completely different.  When it came it was a Calzone not a Sandwich. They should really tell people that their sandwichs are actually Calzones.  I do not eat Calzones.   When I called to complain the manager was rude and raised his voice.  He asked me why his delivery guy was doing in his car for 10 minutes.  I said it looked like he may have been on his phone but I don't know because I was not in his car with him.  The manager then responded with a wise remark.  The manager also decided he was done speaking with me and HUNG UP ON ME!!!!  This place is very unprofessional and really needs an attitude adjustment.    One of the ladies decided to at least try and eat what was delivered.  It is greasy and inedible.  It is nothing but dough.  I will NEVER order from them again and recommend you don't either.
2 I waited an hour for wings and fries. And when the food got here I wasn't impressed and the fries were soggy.
1 I can't speak to the quality of the pizza here, but the rest of their food was awful. We found a little menu in our door and thought we'd give it a shot by ordering the buffalo chicken fingers with a side of Greek fries. On the menu its listed as 10 or 6 wings for $6.99 (which doesn't make a lot of sense) but when we ordered on the phone were told it was TWELVE for $6.99, something we confirmed three times before hanging up. The food took about an hour to show up, which isn't that bad. What was bad were the fries, which were nowhere near being done. They were a wet, soggy mess and a total write off. The chicken fingers tasted like they were frozen, microwaved, then brought to us an hour later. To cap things off, this whole debacle cost $20. We asked for a couple extra ranch dips, they charged us a buck each for three of them. Then they charged us $9.99 for the chicken (even though we confirmed the $6.99 price 3 times on the phone) and $2.99 for the uncooked fries. Add the delivery charge and tip and we were left $20 poorer and still hungry 90 minutes later. Based on this experience I wouldn't dare try ordering a pizza or anything else from here.
1 I ordered a pizza at 12:00 am when the pizza still hadn't showed up at1:30am I called and all the lady could say is, I don't know he should be there soon. I was shocked with tHe response and then went to bed hungry. Then I got a knock at the door at 2am and there he stood a pizza delivery driver with a nice cold,  Cold pizza that looked like it had Been warm, but hours ago. The service of the lady on the phone was f?) $3@... and the 90 year-old man delivering the food must not have had a car but a peddle bike.wow never again. . Thanks for the frozen pie. ....
5 Truly one of the most amazing pizza places in the city, especially for the price. But I would honestly pay double for the quality they provide. Their consistency keeps me coming back. I LOVE that they are open 24 hours, which fits with my crazy schedule, and they're nowhere near the strip where most great 24 hour places are!   The serve pizza, sandwiches, calzones, Italian desserts, etc. Pretty much the expected items at a pizza place. When you call, you do not reach the store but a call-center, that takes your order and forwards it to the store. I have had a couple experiences with a rude girl/woman on the other end while ordering, but this is the only mishap.  The pizza itself is always perfectly cooked, top and bottom, with a level of freshness that you can taste in the dough, sauce, and toppings. They even have a medium 1-topping for $5.00 carryout. Their specialty pizzas may seem expensive (one X-large is 15.99) but being creative with the deals (two X-large any way you want them) let me get two X-large specialty pizzas for $20 plus tax, making each $10.  There are only a couple chairs to wait for pizza, so don't plan a date at this place. There is nowhere to eat. Simply great pizza for carry out or delivery 24 hours.   Five stars, despite the cranky order-taker.
5 Ordered the Parm Sandwich and Jalapeño Poppers. Food was very good. Great for late night food cravings! Keep in mind that food isn't always "Fresh out of the Oven" good when you have it delivered.  Delivery took an hour, which I was amazed at, considering it would take me 20 minutes to drive there myself.
5 Their dough and toppings taste fresh. I love that you can request half and half and choose any crust you want. We ordered the thin grilled garlic chicken. Delivery took just under 45 mins.
1 They advertise 24h delivery, I just called them. The current time us six eleven, am, and the lsdy told me they're close, extremely disappointed, and kinda upset, I was hella craving for a pizza.
1 This place is super funny.. one hell of a joke. I placed an order at 4am... started getting anxious and curious by 5:30am. Called them and asked when the driver would be here. She said "the driver isnt picking up his phone. I dont know where he is" she hung up on me. I called back.. the same lady answered. She then said i dont know Whats going on but the delivery hours are closed now. Pizza guy shows up at 6am. I open the pizza and the whole order was wrong & the pizza was cold.. ive never been so flabbergasted in my life.
1 I wish I could give them 0 stars!!!!! Made an order at around 3 am and of course they tell you that it will take from 45-60 min. I was ok with that but after 1 hour and 30 min has past and I called a lady picked up the phone and couldn't find my order!!!!!! What!!!!!! So she finally found it after asking me 15 questions and placing me on hold for 5 minutes, the delivery JUST left our restaurant, so here I am pissed that 1 it has been 1 hr and 40 min now, 2 she couldn't find my order which probably didn't make until I called. When food got to my house it was cold, the fries were soggy, jalapeño popper weren't fried but baked!!!!!!! Disgusting food to be honest never ever again I will order from here
1 Pizza was disgusting; not fresh and reminded me of Red Barron.  My order took exactly 1hr 47min to arrive; and was cold. When I called to complain; I was provided a $2 discount. The girl was rude; and acted as if it happens all the time; so it was simply no big deal. My order from this place was a mistake to begin with; as I thought I had ordered from my FAVORITE place, Sicilis. BIG MISTAKE!!! If you want GOOD and Authentic pizza; ORDER FROM SICILIS on Twain. Stay far, far away from this place.
1 I wish there was a way I could give them no stars at all.  The food is decent (when it's correct), but the service is awful.  I usually order pizza or their chicken fettuccine alfredo.  Tonight I ordered the chicken alfredo at about 4:00 pm.  It was delivered an hour later and wasn't how we ordered it.  I called and she asked me if I wanted a  10% discount on a future order.  No lady, I just want what I ordered.  She acted like it was a huge deal to send me what I had originally ordered.  It's now 7:00 pm. and we still have not got our reorder.  This is just crazy!  I called about a half an hour ago to ask where it was and she said it was on the way.  It's been 3 hours since I originally called and ordered food and they act like I'm a problem for them.  Wow!  I will NEVER order from this place again.
4 Just went back last night here and got a medium pizza for $5. Person working late last night was very friendly and the lady who took my order was very polite.
1 Ordered for delivery and never received my order. The person working at the time that I checked on it didn't know what happened. This was 2 hours after I ordered. The time that I tried their good for pick up it was overly greasy and soggy.
2 Ok so I won't give it a one star but Ill try one more time to figure it out.   Side note - today is my day off and normally would always go for some pizza or something so decided to try it.   White Garlic pizza - First off I am a huge fan of white garlic pizza if its done right like. either with a oil garlic blend on it. This one well not so much. The crust was super buttery I mean like if you like butter then this is your pizza for you.. I think I should of copied Philip T advise and got hammered then came in here then ordered. The cheese is ok and not sure on the dough I can't make out if its homemade or not to me it has a weird taste to it either being a PHO- Dough or real I still can't figure out.   I ordered chicken wings there more lollipop style witch I guess is the rage here.. to me its over played. Give me a high quality jumbo chicken wing over these any day. They where ok however no sauce and asked for sauce.   Also for to go or delivery you get these blue cheese and guessing ranch packets they say artificially flavored -- Its not a good practice to have these I recommend going with some other company that does not word this -- due to the fact I trashed them Its not that hard to make blue cheese or buy in -- actually Kerns blue cheese is really good and if you get that I would recommend getting some more blue cheese crumbles and combining the 2 it killer good.   Overall -- If your not drunk, high .. on life that is then this place might not be for you  Eating should be about exceptions and overcoming them especially in Vegas.    And if you think this is a hard review then its not the reason I love most of the restaurant's I have been to and seldom leave negative review's unless worthy.
1 My first time using yelp and this delivery service was horrible. It took an hour and 30 for it come after quoting us 45 minutes. The pizza came and it was like warm at best. The driver didn't have my pizza in a warmer when I got it. The pizza itself is hard to judge because I didn't get it hot but the sauce tasted decent. Wouldn't use this place again just because of the fact they didn't deliver a hot pizza
4 Damn, the cheese makes all the difference in the world. The people here take pride in what they make and you can tell. These are true Italians with a true concern for what they produce. I've never left disappointed and their prices arent so bad either
1 Horrible experience.   Thought if give a new place a whirl on my birthday. Big mistake and here is why.  Chicken fingers were like frozen strips of par breaded chewy pressed chicken meat. Par dipped in buffalo sauce   Pizza - I had one slice... Enough said  Delivery - driver forgot my beverages.  Still trying to erase this from my memory!
1 I was craving pizza really bad and we had a menu at our store for this place. So I decided to try it out and got it. I was starving by the time they came and the pizza was still a dissapointment. I paid 20 dollars for the pizza and breadsticks the large pizza was small. The same size as little ceasers $5 pizza and the quality is worse than that of ceasers. Both the pizza and breadsticks was over cooked. Im realky pissed I wasted my hard earned money here. I couldnt even ask anyone else to help pay for the pizza because it was so gross and I picked the place. I really want a refund! Do not order from here
4 - Since I've Lived in Las Vegas This Has Been My Favorite Pizza Spot  I Always Order The Pepperoni Deluxe && Pepsi Best Combo !!!!
1 I hate saying this but I am truly disappointed maybe I ordered too late 3:15 am but the pizza came super fast less than 25 min, then I realized why.  It was reheated and stale, i ordered the extra pepperoni stuffed crust, and it had a layer of  pepperoni over a 2 day old stale hard disgusting old pizza.  Seriously so gross, I over tipped (I also ordered baklava which I also don't recommend because it's a tiny sliver and not worth it) but gave the guy $28 and am so mad at myself!  THIS PIZZA IS NOT EDIBLE! And I mean that in the most serious way, I'm literally not able to chew this gross thing I received (cannot even tell if it is stuffed crust it is so hard) ugh bummer was dying for pizza and wish I would have spent my hard earned money else where.  I will NEVER order here again yuck.
