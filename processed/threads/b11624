4 I am a fan of this store for one particular item:  It's-It Ice Cream Sandwiches...What is it you may ask? Its another one of San Francisco's treats that are available here in Vegas. Its ice cream sandwiched between two oatmeal cookies and entirely dipped in chocolate.  Most grocery stores have Vanilla, but this Vons has Mint and Cappucino It's-Its which is even better! If you haven't had one yet, Its the perfect time to do so!...ALOHA!!!  YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(278/365) "It's-It....That's All."
1 I stopped here for the other night a little after midnight.  They are open 24 hours which is nice.  I'm generally not a big Von's fan.  I find there prices to be high, barring a few items on special and there service doesn't normally make up for the prices.  I grabbed the couple of things that I needed and went to check out.  No one was around but the slot machine guy.  No one was around at all.  I could have walked out with my groceries and no one would have stopped me.  I began to walk around the checkout stand with it's light on looking for someone.  This went on for a few minutes.    Then the slot guy says, "Press the blue button."  What? I though.  "Press the blue button and then press 1, 2, 3.  I looked at him again and he was pointing down by the register.  There was a phone there with no reciever and a homemade sign that said "press the blue button and then press 1, 2, 3, for service...this is not a toy"  Really Von's?  You want me to pay twice the price for your groceries and you can't pay a guy to stand at the register?  After a while longer the cashier arrived.  One item was mispriced.  I showed him in the ad paper and he changed the price.  I got out to the car and realized he still ripped me off on the wrong priced item by a buck due to poor math skills.  There are way too many options to ever darken the door of this place again.  I prolly just caught them on a bad day, but oh well. I don't own Von's stock.  If I did I'd sell it.
1 Poor customer service from cashier, Sheri. She did not greet, nor did she make any eye contact. AND when I informed her that I needed a larger bag of ice, she huffed as if I was causing her a problem. Overpriced store for B-A-D service. Not going back there again.
3 Its a grocery store. Most grocery stores are relatively similar until you get to the speciality stores so for a standard Vons... its A-OK. I'm not a particular fan of this Vons because I have come here and on more than 1 occasion they have had expired items front and center on shelves. I know it happens, I'm not that naive but c'mon egg whites a whole week expired is a little excessive. Maybe its just me. I personally prefer fresh and easy for most of my groceries. Because they are smaller and have a limited selection i'm drawn to Vons b/c its right across the street.  Never had any issues with the staff or checking out. I'll be back.
3 This is a totally fine grocery store. The layout is more confusing than a lot of other places-- refrigerated products are wrapped around the full length of the back of the store, with eggs/milk separated from the cheeses and wines smack dab in the middle of the bakery section. BUT there is a full aisle of cheese which I find it hard to argue with.  The employees have always been friendly here and I notice that they are careful to make sure customers are getting the Von's club discount. I do have to second what another reviewer said about outdated foods, however. Unfortunately I've gotten home with yogurt that was a week past its expiration date and it was a genuine bummer.
4 I know it is a grocery store but I walked out of there last night with a big smile . I tend to be a late night shopper (I am the NIGHT OWL) so I stroll in after 10:00PM grab a cart and get my shopping on. If you are not a member of the VON's shopping club "shame on you". You can say you the prices are high and you are just buying at normal prices with your shopper's card but I beg to disagree. They had 24 ounce salsa at 2 for $4 and my coupon gave me another $1 off. Get that on name brand salsa somewhere else. I had loaded a coupon for 16 ounces of Oscar Mayer bologna for $1.49. I rarely eat lunch meat but for that price hell yay. I got the beef bologna and got to register and it rang up $5.99. Showed the cashier my print out and she rang it up for $1.49. My total bill $22.00 and change. My savings $25.00 and change. Just saying. I am not a big shopper but I do like a deal. How are about you?  It's a grocery store so in good conscience I could not give 5 stars, but it was a 5 star experience.
5 Great store better staff!!! They have everything you need. If not ask for it and they will try to get it for you. Always helpful, will open a check out ASAP if it gets busy!!! The entire staff is friendly and greets you by your name!!!
