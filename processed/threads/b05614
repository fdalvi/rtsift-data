5 Everytime, my husband and i come to vegas, we can't stop but think about eating at Joy's. The buffet is delicious and the best pinoy buffet in Las Vegas. You get everything (except chicken skin, it's sold for like 3 buxs for a huge ziploc freezer bag) and the ginataag bilo bilo is to die for...............my husband literally had over 10 bowls along with his breakfast buffet. And the price: 6.99. Next year when we go to vegas, Joy wil be the first place we hit. Awesome food and awesome choices.
5 This place has very authentic Filipino food. So good! Really good! Too good!!!
5 I think this place is the best Filipino buffet in Las Vegas . I never had a bad dish n the selection of pinoy foods is abundant. It's a small but clean place. The bilo bilo is fantastic, perfect dessert to end your meal. And yes she has a la carte items, topsilog, goto, mami, siopao, sigsig sigsig,  kalderta. and take out 3 items with either rice or pancit: 5.99. This place is a must for any pinoy/pinay to try while in vegas. Eggs are made to order with buffet
