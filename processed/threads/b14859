5 Parking is a little tough on the weekends, but other than that this place is a great place to shop. They have everything from fresh fruit to lounge chairs. This Fry's has very friendly people and quick service. Try the chicken salad in the deli, it is the best.
3 Avoid this market the first Wednesday of every month at all costs. It's a blue hair invasion.  Robert Pfeifer
5 Good place to shop.
4 Good selection, helpful staff. First Wednesday of the month is some sort of coupon day, so there's the entire community of Sunbird and whatnot shopping here.
4 awesome job for my son's cup cakes
2 Purchased a cake for my 2 year olds birthday.  Was suppose to be a picture of buzz and woody on the front. Instead I got a blank picture of space and a woody and buzz figure ( which I was charged an additional 4 dollars for).  I would not use them again and if your thinking about it your better off buying a cake at Costco and putting the two figures on it yourself.  Especially for the 40 dollars I spent on this boring cake.
4 I like Fry's. clean stores, friendly locations, I think I'm getting wonderful prices. really like the fuel rewards!
5 Great store, Clean Friendly and great prices. Wish they had Wi-Fi... Too bad Albertson's generally has better meat prices. Still 5 stars though. Hey I'm one of those Wednesday Afternoon or Thursday shoppers!
5 I enjoy shopping here.  They have good deals, clean store, good selection of everything.  Good customer service.
4 This is a normal Fry's Marketplace that is currently undergoing a remodel. Spacious aisles and friendly workers - many times I've been asked how I was doing or if I needed any assistance. Generally good prices permitting that you have a Fry's card - and with that said you can use your phone number that is one file if you don't want to carry the card around (I'm somewhat of a minimalist).
5 Love it here!!  Great deals!! Great prices!! Great Just remodeled and now has a Starbucks!!
