1 I like and use the Panda Express on N power, but this PE is closer to my house so I gave it a try. They were so nasty there I have not returned in over a year and probably never will. I got the feeling if I was non-white I would have been better served. In the 100 plus times I have eaten out in Mesa, this was a first. I am respectful of all peoples.
3 I don't eat fast food often but every once in a while I really crave panda! Their prices are good for how much food you get. This location is always fast, friendly, and the food is always hot. My favorites are the bejing beef and the orange chicken. The chow mein and fried rice are good. They usually give you a coupon on the receipt for the next time where you can get an extra item free. I also noticed that they are now serving brown fried rice. It is nice to have a healthier option available. They followed with the new California regulations and have calories posted on all the items. Knew it was bad but now it is confirmed! Still so good sometimes!
3 Long wait, bad noodle, not worth it.Dat orange chicken be hot!!! Review by my good loking son (reviews made by 13 year old not to take seriously) 》》》》》》《《》》¤¤¤.º:-D:-):'(:-(:-D:-)
1 Extremely small portions and horrible customer service. All of the employees seemed to be having their own conversations among themselves and really didn't seem to want to help anyone.
1 Worst Panda Express ever! Possibly the worst meal we've ever spent money on. My hubby made the mistake of not checking the boxes of food before he left the restaurant. He came home with dinner. His teriyaki chicken was black, too burnt to eat. My beef and broccoli had one piece of beef and the fried rice was just rice and a little hard. Absolutely disgusting. Avoid this Panda Express by far the worst experience I've had with them.
