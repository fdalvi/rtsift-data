5 This store has Coke Zero in their fountain offerings!
1 The chicken tenders had a weird rubbery texture and this was the second time so no more for me.
4 Second best Carl's Jr. in Las Vegas! Food is always fresh and hot and service is very good.
2 Went through drivethru and was given the wrong food. Went back to exchange and the staff thought it was funny, then refilled my drink with the wrong thing.  Disappointed.
