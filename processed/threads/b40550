5 Betsy is the BEST... She can do it all! She's been doing my extensions, color & blow outs for a year now!!! AMAZING!  She always works with my crazy busy schedule. She's a master Brazilian Blowout Specialist!  The salon is so cute! Environment is awesome! The salon has 4 stylist & they can do all your hair care needs.
5 I've been seeing Tracy over 3 years and I've never left disappointed. I let her do her thing with my color and it looks great. I have long hair and she's never chopped it off either (that's always a fear seeing someone new)
5 Betsy has been doing my hair for years and I am always confident in whatever she has in mind because I always love it! If you want beautiful frizz-free hair, ask Betsy about the Brazilian Blowout, you won't be disappointed!!
5 I have been going to Betsy for a while now and I have to say that Betsy is the absolute best color technician I have ever been to. In addition she gives a great haircut. My hair is healthy and beautiful thanks to Betsy! She also does the Brazilian Blowout. she is very knowledgeable about this process and can answer any question for you. She takes her career seriously and that makes me respect her even more.
