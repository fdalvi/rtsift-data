5 As a new homeowner, it was important to find a pest control company that is reliable, affordable and easy to communicate with.  In the last couple months we have turned away many pest companies that have knocked on our door.  Karlie was the reason we chose to sign up.  We discussed our needs and she made sure we would be taken care of, the way WE want it done.  Their cost is way lower than the others who we have used in the past, and the ones who have contacted us recently,  the company itself is very customer oriented.  John the owner, called to verify our appointment and Michael showed up right on time to do our initial spraying. The chemicals they use are safe for pets "which was important to us since we have 2 rambunctious yorkies".  We are on an annual agreement with visits every 3 months...if we need anything inbetween, they will come at no additiional charge. This is a small business with a HUGE heart. I highly recommend!
5 These guys have been spraying my home for the past 3 yrs and I've never had any issues with bugs. Before them, I had tried 3 or 4 other companies that just weren't as reliable.  The best part is they will work hard around your schedule. I usually leave for work early and they always show up before work, on time, and get the job done quickly.   If you need a reputable pest control team, these are the guys! The price is super reasonable too!
5 I am very pleased with the quick response for service and the thorough spraying of the outside as well as the inside of the home.  Plus the special care our bug man showed of my personal items around the home shows outstanding services.
