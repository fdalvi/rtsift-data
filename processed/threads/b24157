5 What a wonderful place to relax on a budget! Right now you can get a student to work on you for 35 bucks for a whole hour of wonderful massage. Some of the students do cranial sacral work, acupressure, reiki and this school also trains people in intuitive ability. They have a lot of interesting things going on.  They are running these student clinics a lot longer than usual. There is a special rate for seniors too only 25 dollars.   I have a lot of health issues and they are really good at working with me to address all my concerns and making sure I am feeling ok. I have had massages at other schools but since they do the reiki and the intuition training here it always seems the healing is more intensive and long lasting. I was in a car accident and had some serious neck problems and wow this is the place to go when they creep up. If you are having some pain I really recommend it. Females would like to go here a lot it is very arty and super girlie it is run by women and it has a girl environment feeling. Guys would like it too cause it is all women HA. Lot of wonderful art on the walls all really cool themes rooms with cool interesting things to look at a very interesting place to immerse your spirit. They do these intuitive training classes for artists who are blocked as well. A sort of personal coaching tool for you blocked poets and writers in the Madison area!
5 Had another awesome massage......yummmmmmmmmmmmm
5 My boyfriend and I purchased two groupons for a massage here and redeemed them for a couples massage. We were the first couples massage here! Both masseurs were attentive, courteous and very friendly. It was a great experience overall and I would recommend it wholeheartedly.
