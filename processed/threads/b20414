1 This is for the miserable excuse for a cafe and it's glum staff. The most depressed tuna melt I have eaten in my life.
4 Theres an atmosphere in Tesco that i feel is missing in Asda's & Morrisons. I cant really explain it, but suffice to say i feel more relaxed shopping in Tesco. I do agree that the worst suppermarket Cafés are in Tesco, but as they are franchised, i cant let that affect my review, however, 4 Stars since they have not upgraded to a Costa Franchise yet.
1 shopped here for years , absolutely rubbish , only go here as no other close by. I live 2 minutes away. Atmosphere terrible , shop staff look really miserable , and depressed. Shelves always empty , always an excuse about short staffed . Would benefit from a local competitor , like a Morrison's or sainsbury in musselburgh.
1 Back in again yesterday , just after 5 in afternoon. What a pathetic excuse for a store . Shelves were once again empty , shockingly so this time . Each department had areas that reminded me of the old news reports of bare shelves in the old USSR , Butter , decimated , milk , few and far between ,  bread in very short supply. Place would be better laying bowling mats after 5 , then we could all have a worthwhile experience. They seem to think that by 5 pm , the day is over ,no one else wants the staples , so they don't bother replacing the stuff , the pensioners or unemployed folk take during the day. They really don't need to ask why the isles are very frequently empty of customers , and why the Tesco profits are on a downward trend , they appear to have given up , and be accepting defeat to the likes of Lidl , Aldi , and Icelands of the country.
4 Tesco of Musselburgh is a great place to shop at.  Today I bought a bottle of "Finest" Vintage Cava (amazingly, with the addition of Chardonnay grapes, very unusual for a Cava) for only £6.99  Their coffees and teas are wonderful.
