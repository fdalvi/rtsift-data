5 Excellent very comprehensive. Great dentist in a field where it's hard to find a good practitioner.
5 Thank you for an incredible job. Your staff is so nice and you are extremely professional not only with taking great care of the necessities, but also cosmetically. You are a rare gem on both sides. It was nice o move here from Ohio and find you just down the street. Anyone looking for a well rounded dentist to be not only gentle but an expert in his field cannot go wrong in coming to your practice.
1 I was in there for a simple cleaning and exam. an hour and a half later, no cleaning but I did get the hard sell from the "business manager" Michelle who proposed a 5 page, year long treatment plan. I have no problems with my teeth yet they insisted I needed scalar planing under anesthesia TWICE. I said I'm here for a cleaning. the business manager said "we can't do that.". I walked out and promptly got a friend referral to another dentist.   the new dentist called Abbott's office 3 times for my x-rays that were never sent, causing a delay in getting in to see the new dentist  They were finally emailed to me after I called Michelle and told her we could have a discussion in the office or she could send them immediately.   Oddly enough, despite Abbott's staff finding ALL 3s and 4s in my gums, my new dentist found ONE - everything else 1s and 2s. Abbott and his business manager just want to sell services. Oh yeah, I mentioned that I got migraine headaches about once every 2-3 months, and they insisted I needed to see a specialist who they recommended for a custom mouth guard and yep, a long-term treatment plan. Amazing.
