5 Nice little place to stop and grab some food in gila bend. Has the usual Mexican food menu you might expect from a drive thru style business. I had a carne asada burrito that was freshly made and taste great. If by any chance you find yourself out in these woods I would make the stop! Lol
5 Get anything Carne Asada! Big portions and great price. I was forced to kill my girlfriends leftovers and then her daughters too!
5 What a great place to eat. The burrtios are huge and the carne asada is so tastey!. Angel the manager is a great cook and a very polite guy. I always walk out happy with a full tummy. If you want to eat real good Mexican food, stop by at humbertos you will be very happy!
1 This place was not our first choice, but we could not find the other Mexican spot. We found the food bland, the salsa was probably canned, the beans appeared to be also. My husband found the tiny, flimsy plastic forks hard to use. The horchata was too sweet for my taste. Seemed pricey for the setting, the plastic. Can not recommend.
