4 I was welcomed with a crisp, clean looking salon and bright, smiling customer service attendants.  I was asked my name, greeted formally, and taken to a sitting area for a mani & pedi.  The lovely lady attendant then asked what I would like to drink, and brought my chamomile tea with honey on the side.  While I waited I flicked through the latest issue of Glamour magazine and read up on "The Best Ways to Please a Man."  Shortly thereafter I was gathered by Dawn who guided me toward the nail polish where I chose a color for my toes and nails.  We then proceeded to the pedicure chairs.  Wow, I was sat in a massaging, heated pedicure chair in front of floor to ceiling windows.  What a lovely, calming view!  Dawn did a good job on my nails, and was a fountain of information.  I asked her about XS and Tryst, as well as other Vegas Insider knowledge.  The paraffin wax on my feet was amazing and Dawn's foot massage felt amazing.  It's definitely a must by anyone who has the time.
2 I recently got a full set of gels two days before my wedding. Within 24 hours, they began to break -- actually, not just break, more like shatter! - and yes, I was being very careful with them. Luckily I had nail glue with me as I had no time to go back to get them fixed, and I managed to hide the breaks well enough for my wedding. The following day, another one broke, and at that point I just gave up and cut them back with nail clippers.   I have never seen gels do something like this before, ever. Since Encore is such a fabulous place, I assumed that they would have only the best personnel and products in their salon. Apparently not. And the price? Overpriced even for great service and products -- and in my case, a total rip-off.
4 I have been to this salon twice within the past 3 months.  I want to start with the most recent visit as this is what has prompted me to write this review.  Or, I should say, one person has, Verenice?(not sure on spelling). On my most recent visit I wasn't permitted to spa/massage as I normally would do to a recent surgery, so I decided to treat myself to a haircut and pedi instead.  I was a bit hesitant to have someone unknown cut and style my hair.  OMG...Verenice did an AMAZING job. With just a cut and blowdry she made my hair look better than it's ever looked..no flat iron or curling iron needed(as I usually have to do to make it decent).  I got several compliments on it...and the best part?  It lasted through the next two days! That's unheard of for me.  The day after I'm usually washing again or in a pony-tail.  Needless to say...I will splurge to visit her every time in Vegas now!    The pedi...I chose the $95 version..a bit expensive for what it is...but the view is quite relaxing especially if sipping a glass of chamagne.  I had Brenda on this trip...and I must say she did a much better job than the last pedi I had there a few months ago(can't remember the woman's name..but short blonde hair).   Also had a mani a few months ago there w/a tall slender asian guy.  It was good and looked nice, but I don't feel it stayed as nicely as the mani I had @ Vdara's salon around New Years Eve time.    Can't say enough about the haircut though!  It rocked!
