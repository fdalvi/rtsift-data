5 I love Home Good! It's going to be dangerous having one so close to home.... This is the place to go if your redecorating your house looking for an awesome gift or looking for a tchotchkes to fill some space!   The prices are awesome! Just recently bought a whole new bedding set for only 40$!!! And a lamp for 30$! Decorative pillows for 10$ I splurged.   This location is very clean and organized and the staff is super helpful and friendly!   Ill be here often.
3 Big store. Good choices and easy to find things. Was not that busy so I didn't have to wait in a long line at all. There was not a lot of employees working though because usually at other HomeGoods stores' someone always asks if you need help or not while walking around the store and I didn't see one person at all. Didn't have a good selection for lots of the aisles which was very disappointing. The clearance section was huge but the shelves hardly had anything on them unlike other Marshall's HomeGoods stores. Disappointed by the store itself and won't be coming back here again.
5 If anyone is a fan of Home Goods, it's me. I love bargain shopping and if you're looking for the best deals around, this chain (also including Marshalls and TJ Maxx) is the best of the best. Check it out, you won't regret it.
