5 Dr. Hanna has the best "bedside" manner per se ...  The staff is really nice and considerate of your time. They are friendly and chatty if you are with them. Dr. Hanna takes the time to speak in detail with his patients to answer any questions they might have about the procedures they are considering.  I have already had Gastric Bypass surgery and have been looking to get back on track with things since having moved to Las Vegas and been dislocated from my original physician. They have support groups that have meetings at the facility (which makes it very convenient to attend) as well as monthly walks to get people out there and socializing. I have an Upper GI scheduled for when I get back from travel and I will post another update to discuss in more detail the service for followup.
