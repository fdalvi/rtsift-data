5 Super friendly staff! This location just opened near my home, and we are so glad!   We've been in a few times, once on a very busy football day and then on a slower weeknight.   Both times we received fast, accurate service and the wait was never long. I like that we get to watch our pizza being made right in front of us.  The directions to bake are easy to understand and follow.    The pizza is delicious.  We've had pretty much everything they have on the menu over the years.  The cinnamon dessert wheel is great too.    The prices are more than the hot and ready pizza across the way, but it is in line for the quality and variety of pizza you get.   We are Papa Murphys fans, and we'll be back again!
5 Pizza is fresh, tasty and a good deal.  This is our go to pizza place now.
5 Service here is always quick and the staff are very friendly!  Their five dollar pizzas beat Little Ceasers any day!!
