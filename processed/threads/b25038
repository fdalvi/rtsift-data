5 I went to Kings and Queens to get my tree braids in my hair. I had never heard of tree braids till I saw their ad on Craigslist, but the picture looked cute so I decided to try it. My stylist name was Pebbles. Usually I get my hair done at someone's house, but this is actually a barbershop/salon. The workers there are very funny, telling jokes, great Barbershop type atmosphere with the jokes and people coming in to sell jewelry and selling cd's and dvd's.  They cut hair as well and do wave nouveaus or jerri curls. It took a very long time for my hair to be done, 9 hours in total. But my hair looks FABULOUS. I'll be back to get my hair done again.
4 I went here to get my 6yr old a haircut, and  i was very satisfied. It was my first time there, and I will be going back soon.  Kenny cut my sons hair and did a wonderful job. He didn't take a long time at all, which was good because there was a bit of a wait as is. They seem busy all the time. The guy with the shades on in front takes along time and is kind of pushy trying to sell you everything he has to offer.but for the most part Music was good, maybe it could have been a little more kid friendly.Overall I had a good experience. Want to go and eventually get my hair done by the stylist that was from California, she does good hair.
1 Never again. Stylist never showed up. I called for a same day appointment. I was told to be there at 5:30. We are now leaving at 6:10pm and Diane never showed up. Don't schedule an appointment and not show up. Bad for business.
