5 There are quite a few gas station around where I live. Many have the same prices, but I always get my gas at this station.   The place is always spotless. The restrooms are clean and not grungy. The people working here are efficient, friendly.   The drinks aren't as cheap as Circle K, but I prefer to reuse my cup instead of throw styrofoam away.   I guess the only downside is there tend to be cops there frequently at night, this might not be great for everyone. The cops aren't there because of trouble, but they get stuff from this store.  Personally, I think this recommends this station.
5 Quick Trip, Quick Trip, Quick Trip! hooray! best gas station eva! Tons of drink options, coffees, slushies, griller food, doughnuts, snacks, tons of beverages, best pricing on gas, clean restrooms, list goes on & on
5 Friendly, clean and fast. Love how all QTs are like this, and in glad this one is close to my husbands fam, always have to stop here for snacks or drinks before going to see them! :)
