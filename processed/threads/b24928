5 great guys excellent work quick return.. I own a business and need my trucks fix asap when they break down . Kevin and kurt are my go to guys for all auto repair needs thx you both
2 Called for a price to replace an engine and transmission mount on my Honda Civic.  They quoted a price much lower than the dealership.  I told them exactly what was going on and what was needed before they gave me a price.  I made an appt to take it in.  I took the car in and, after 45 min, they told me that now that they had the VIN # they knew that a different mount was needed that would cost $200 more and that they couldn't get for 5 days.  I drove an hour to get there.  Why didn't they ask for the VIN # before they gave me a price and made an appt?  Needless to say, I'm not a happy camper.  And I'm pretty sure my other car was side swiped while sitting in their crowded parking lot.
5 I've known these guys for several years now and have been able to send them quite a bit of business. It's been great to have such an honest mechanic I can trust. I have had them do everything from transmissions to oil changes and everything in between. Their prices are fair, but more importantly you can trust them. I wouldn't hesitate to refer them to any of my friends and family.
