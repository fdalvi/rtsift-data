5 I'm SUCH a Phoebe.  Yeah, like, from Friends.  Remember that episode when Rachel and Phoebe were living together and Rachel got that Apothecary table from Pottery Barn but couldn't tell Phoebe that it was from Pottery Barn because Phoebe hates mass produced items with no sense of history or originality?  But when Phoebs though it was from a garage sale she loved it?  Yeah,  I'm totally just like that.  I eschew mainstream consumerism and the like.  BUT, Pottery Barn is a little slice of heaven.  I could just hang out in there forever sitting on furniture and holding trinkets and accessories and decorate my dream house.  And, the few times I (ok, my mom) bought things from them, they quality has been excellent.  Granted, they were small things like margarita sets and placemats and coasters, but man are they enjoyable small things.  They have a registry available, and although I'm not expecting a marriage in my life anytime soon, I think I'm going to go register there just for kicks.  Let me know if you want that info.  You know, if you're feeling generous.  And maybe I should do something about my Friends obsession.
1 On two different occasions I have encountered two rude sales people at this store.  The first time I was checking out their dining room tables and had actually received a code to use online for 10% off.  I asked the lady if they would match it and she pretty rudely told me no, and that I am better off buying it in the store to keep the money local.  I explained to her that even with shipping/frieght charges the piece I was looking at was $180 cheaper.  Her reply was, well, it's only $180, just buy it in the store!  I was taken aback.  I don't have money to throw away, just because I was in Pottery Barn doesn't mean I have a money tree in my backyard.  Are the only allowed to shop here have a mon ey is no object attitude?  And let's not forget when I was looking at dining room table that was a floor sample and the sales lady said she would look for the leaf for it, but only if I was serious about buying it and walked off.  I have worked customer service for a long time in the past and just couldn't believe the attitude.  The second time I had to buy a dining chair because the Las Vegas store did not have the number of chairs I needed.  The sales people were again rude, like I was wasting their time by only buying one dining room chair.  It was Memorial Day weekend and we asked if they gave a military discount and they said no with an attitude.  We had just came from the Las Vegas store where they don't normally do discounts for military but the manager happily gave it to us and thanked us for our service.  I will drive all the way up to the Vegas store to avoid the attitude here.
3 Pottery Barn is fun for decorating inspiration, but I haven't ever purchased anything at this location.  The salespeople are helpful and friendly, but I just haven't felt the urge to get out the plastic and commit to buying anything.  HOWEVER, I am absolutely DYING to have one of their desks that you can custom-design.  The white one.  The pretty white one with the pretty white rolling chair.  My fianc√© and I go to nearby Lucille's really often for tea and BBQ, and every time we're there, I have to go visit "my desk."  When I move to Missouri in a month or two, I will be ordering the pretty desk.  I might go broke, but it's worth it.  I love you, pretty white desk.  You will be mine someday.  Ahem.    Other than that, I really like Pottery Barn's design aesthetic.  However, I usually scope out their stuff and then find something similar (and cheaper) elsewhere.
4 I've been spending a ton of time soaking up home decor ideas for the place I bought this summer but have been paralyzed by too many options.  The employees at Pottery Barn are always more than happy to spend time with me listening to my visions and making recommendations, even looking at photos of my home.  I recently called to see if they had an item in stock.  They didn't but they were able to have it shipped to the store for pick up so I could avoid shipping costs.  I even told them about a 10% coupon I had and they gave me the 10% with no questions asked, and let me keep the coupon for a future purchase!  The item arrived very quickly and they called me as soon as it was in.  They helped me load it into the car despite it being very heavy.  Great service at this location.    In my experience the furniture here is a little pricey but really is worth it.  I've only gotten small things - benches, console tables, etc. - but they are such high quality and beautiful additions to my home.  I really think I'll have these pieces for years - the only reason I foresee having to get rid of them is if I remodel...  Great place just to browse for ideas or shop for home decor and furniture!
