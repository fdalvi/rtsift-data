5 Greg is extremely knowledgable and helpful.  Work was completed promptly and correctly.  Highly recommended for taxes, payroll, and any accounting need for the small business owner!
5 I have used an accounting firm for several years and felt as if they were "the man behind the curtain". I decided I wanted a more "hands-on" firm that educated me more about accounting practice so I could ask more intelligent questions - Greg was the guy! This fiscal year has started with a chart of accounts that makes more sense and is more logically organized. I am no longer "on the outside". Greg took the time to ask good questions and offered suggestions that made me think about better ways for measuring my business and bettered prepared for tax submission reporting. You will not regret enlisting his expertise - call him.
5 Was referred to Greg by a friend since relocating from the northwest. Greg has been nothing but amazing! Greg is very knowledgeable and gave me much needed education throughout the process of getting my taxes done. Never experienced that with my previous CPA. Thankful to be working with him and look forward to working together in the future.
5 Greg was a very pleasant person to work with.  Last year I started my own business and I also got married.  I had a lot of questions and concerns about filing my taxes as a married man as a new business owner.  He did everything I expect him to do and more. He was extremely helpful in walking me through the differences of filing jointly or separately.  He took the time to listen to my questions regarding my new business venture and gave me direction on how to document my expenses and income for the coming year.  He was quick to respond to emails and phone calls.  I highly recommend his services to anyone.  Thanks Greg!
