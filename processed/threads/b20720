5 This the best Indian/ Tandoori ever. I visit once a week for sure. I have a veggie Biryani, and it does me two nights. HUGE meal.  Very pleasant owner, opens door for me on way out and always says " Have a good night sir" Can't fault the place, and local. Give it a try. A wee bit pricy , but the meals are huge! Yummy!
