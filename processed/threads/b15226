3 I think the consistency in size at Abercrombie is a problem. The service at this location is better than most I have ever seen at an Abercrombie. I have had no problems with returns or exchanges, which happens sometimes when ordering online. I love how the whole store smell of cologne. It's cold in that store. I remember feeling too cold to shop - well almost. They have sales and coupons a lot! That makes me happy.
4 My husband got me a dress here and it was super cute, but too short. There was also a long string near the waist that I noticed, but did not pay much attention too. I went to Paradise Valley to return it (tags on with receipt) and they said there was a  missing belt. I let them know it did not have a belt when he got it,but they would not take it back.  So I went to Fashion Square where he got it, explained the situation and they happily took it back and credited my card, not just a store credit. Thanks!
4 Ummmm...I feel sort of ashamed giving this a four star review, but here goes nothing:  Cons:  1. They play the music way too loud As another yelper said, I could barely hear myself think when I went inside  2. Pictures are really disturbing I see little 9 year olds come in; this is not really okay  3. Quality is not the best My shirt ripped;( AFTER A WEEK  Pros:  1. Some of their clothing is quite cute. At this store I snagged a lace shirt for ten dollars! This shop is supposed to be expensive, right?  And that's it for the pros. I guess I could give it a 3 but the clothing is quite nice and where else can I get a cute cotton shimmery dressy cardigan for less than thirty bucks?
