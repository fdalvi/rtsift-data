1 This is another store from which we have to move our dollars away from.      We often use them for clothing and some housewares.   They are also conveniently located by other businesses that we frequently shop at.  Sadly, they have chosen to open their stores early this Thanksgiving destroying any chance for their employees to enjoy the holiday.  As a result we will be taking our dollars elsewhere.    Any store that opens prior to 5am on friday morning after Thanksgiving will lose our business.
3 While ShopKo is still needing to up its game in general, I stopped in for the Payless. I had a coupon and wasn't sure how it would work with the store-in-a-store situation. The clerk at the checkout was very happy to take it and even double-checked that it had gone through the system properly. 2 people greeted me when I entered and 3 thanked me as I left. While the offerings of the store are needing a bit of improving, they've got their customer service down pat.
1 The employees in this store--if you can FIND one to help you--are indifferent or rude. I can only conclude this is a poorly-managed store that doesn't train or pay their employees properly and under-staffs to save money. I will not shop here anymore.
