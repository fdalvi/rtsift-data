2 The main benefit of this Goodwill is that it's large. That's a good thing, because at least 50% of what it contains is utter crap.   Really, they will put just about anything on the shelf. I've seen spaghetti sauce jars, canisters with no lids, broken electronics, you name it. Or sometimes items are priced for more than what they would cost new. $1.00 for a mason jar? Really?  Though, this is where I scored a Loverboy album, and a sweet American flag patterned vest for my Tea Party protestor costume.  Also, it's between Dollar Tree and Tuesday Morning. So you can get all your cheapo shopping done at once.
3 i'm not a huge fan of those location. it's often extremely busy on sale day. and it is particularly unorganized.  the staff likes to take breaks all at once. i once saw a dozen workers assemble outside the front door. i'm not sure who was left inside working. they were engulfed in a cloud of smoke that i had the displeasure of walking through on my way to the car.  i don't usually find a whole lot of decent stuff here. i wouldn't say they're good for anything in particular.  bathroom report: not the worst, but not the best.
4 I return frequently to this goodwill. It's not the most fancy but it doesn't smell horrible and the clothes are usually organized. 8/10 times I leave with something. I only clothes shop though.
