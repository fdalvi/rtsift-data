5 I've been to this McDonald's twice now and the service is fast, friendly, and fantastic! Their employees are very helpful and make sure your order is complete and correct before they hand it over to you.   I recommend giving this location a try if you haven't yet. The experience is well worth it!
1 Go to this McDonalds just cause its next to work.  Service is slow...  everyone seems like they don't want to work there.  Even the supervisor doesn't even want to take orders.  Hashbrown taste like a filot fish.  Even drive-thru takes forever.
1 This McDonalds has very poor service. The employees seemed like they did not want to work there at all. Food sometimes takes quite some time to come out. I go here since it is right next to work and is very close. Other coworkers also complain about this McDonalds not being that great and recommended me to actually go out of my way to a different place to get breakfast.
1 I've been to this location 3 different times and ordered 2 double cheeseburgers all 3 times and it was beyond terrible. Cold patties, cheese not melted, carelessly thrown together burgers, fries taste like they have been sitting for days. McDonald's is never expected to be the caviar of food but I would at least expect some sort of quality. If there was an option for 1/2 of a star I would do it.
3 Slowest.... McDonald's..... Ever.... With two drive-thru you would think that this would go a lot faster. I'm very rational about waiting, but what bothers me the most is a type of customer service. Better training is needed. Otherwise great design.
