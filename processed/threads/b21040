5 My flatmate plays for the Edinburgh University rugby team and this is the place he picks up all of his accessories. I have been there a couple of times with him and they really do seem to have everything you could want if you play rugby, or if you are an avid supporter of rugby. They have a huge selection of rugby boots that high street shops simply wouldn't be able to compete with. They also do a good selection of rugby shirts, both international and domestic, and even offer you with the chance to get a name and number printed on the back of it. Every rugby accessory imaginable is also on offer here- rugby balls, tees, gum shields, headgear, shoulder padding etc. The staff look really knowledgeable and was even able to identify what position my flatmate played just by looking at him.
4 A great store for rugger tragics and Antipodean lost souls like me...if only they poured a pint as well I'd never leave!
4 Good rugby store, decent selection and helpful staff
