3 Gotta love 50 cents Wing Wednesday...smothered in their signature sauce of your choice. I love the spicy Buffalo Burnin' Hot wings. It's so spicy it will make your head spin. Just the way I like them.   We also ordered the Super Supreme and Meat Lovers pan pizza which was loaded with toppings. Great Pizza Hut locations.
1 this particular pizza hut is the worst one we've ever ordered from! They always mess up our orders, either delivery OR carry out!!! They NEVER remember to give us our sauces that we PAY for, and last night (halloween night) we ordered our pizza and bread sticks at 8:13pm and at 9:50pm we finally got our order delivered..We had to call twice to see where they were...the first time they lied to us and said that the order had gone out and should be there any minute..so we waited about 20 mins (note the pizza hut is only 5 mins away..) and called again..this time a different person answered and said that the order had been over looked and was "coming out of the oven right now". well they got here about 5 minutes later and ALL of our food was cold! not even the slightest bit warm...COLD and none of the sauces were delivered..and we ordered extras. This is not the only time these mess ups have happened..this is about the 4th time and we are now DONE with ordering from them. NOT IMPRESSED!
1 Ordered days in advanced to have it done by a specific time and there was a 10 minute delay.  A dozen people came in after me and had speedy service I definitely won't be going back. Ill stick with papa John's.
