4 Went through Oasis to have my first baby. Loved them (doctors nurses and office staff). Everybody always treated me good and listened to any concerns I ever had. Only problem I had was the wait time. Seems like over the months the office has become pretty popular but staff hasn't increased. Other than that would totally recommend. :)
3 My mom and I use Oasis for their Forever Fit/HCG program. It's a great program and Michelle is wonderful. The only problem is that they have their own "section" in the office so the front desk won't even deal with you. I hate this because they never answer the phone and I never get a call back. On the off chance I do get  a call back, it's 4 days later. I have to psychically go in person to schedule my appointments, otherwise it won't get done. Most of the office staff is nice but Lydia is not. She refuses to deal with me when I call. I understand it's probably protocal to transfer me to the Forever Fit line but when they never answer, it shouldn't be a big deal to schedule my appointment through the front desk considering every computer in the office uses the same scheduling system.
5 This is the best OBGYN office I've ever been too, everyone is friendly and helpful. It's also very clean and organized. I'm also always able to get in for an appointment on the date/time I want.
1 Worst experience ever. Very unfortunate for my first pregnancy. Symptoms were just brushed off, Dr. Messer only saw me twice during my entire pregnancy because she kept canceling my appt, and found out in the hospital by another doctor I was severely anemic! I had to get a blood transfusion because my count was so low. Made the drive from Tempe out to see her and will never waste my time again.
