5 Desert Spring United Methodist Church is a very inviting, home comfort type of church. I have attended many times and always love seeing the people.
4 *** This review is for the Desert Spring Theatre Arts at Desert Spring Methodist Church ***  I went to see Bye, Bye Birdie yesterday at the church.  I was asked if I'd judge the 6 productions the company is doing during the 2013 season that began with Birdie.    First, the venue is quite nice for doing a theatre piece, but it does have some drawbacks.  The scenery changes had to be done very carefully as there are three steps that go to the floor.  The youngsters and adults who were changing the scenery did so with flashlights so they could avoid a fall--quite understandable but something you don't see with most theatres.  The sound in the church was very good.  With some other theatres in Las Vegas, the person in the sound booth didn't turn on microphones quickly enough and some of the first words were not heard as well because the mic was not yet live.   Given the nature of the "stage the actors did a fine job in moving in and around set pieces.  At times, there were quite a few performers on stage which made the going a little difficult but they pulled it off well.  I look forward to attending the rest of their season.  The church is only 2 miles from my home and it's a pleasure to see the kids do such fine work.  Oh, the adults did a nice job also!
5 Beautiful sanctuary, very friendly and very informative sermons.  There is weekly classes and worship.  Lots of misson projects..
