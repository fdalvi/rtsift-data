5 OMG!  Just moved to the neighborhood a week or so ago and had a craving for fish tacos. I knew this place was up the street so I stopped in on my way home from work. The Fish Taco plate was reasonably priced at $6.19. The little waitress at the drive-thru window was a doll. Asking if I wanted hot sauce I responded that I  wanted the hotest they had.  She gave me both the red and the green telling me that heat was relative and to try both. Fair enough. When I got home and opened the to-go container I was greeted to 2 HUGE tacos and a generous portion if refried beans and rice. I tried the beans first, cause in my book it you can't get the refried beans right the rest if the meal with most likely suck. Lemme tell you...these were the most flavorful refried beans I've ever had! Anywhere. Including my own. This was going to be a great meal!! The fish tacos were made of cod fried in a light batter with pico de gallo, shredded cabbage, and a spicy cream sauce. Heaven! The best I've had since Denver! The meal was so good I finished the entire container, and that never happens. Try this little Mexican place, I can only imagine everything on the menu us this good. And trust me, I will be trying everything!

5 My Dearest Federico's,  It's been a while since we last spoke. I'd like to say that I've been busy, and just haven't had the time, but that would be a lie. The truth is, I've wanted to write, but it just hurts too much. I miss you, Federico. I miss everything about you. The rolled tacos with Guacamole and cheese. The Carne Asada burritos. The morning wood.   I miss waking up, not grouchy, but eager, because I knew I'd see you on my way to work. I still remember the first time I stuck your meat in my mouth. I remember being nervous because I knew nothing about you. I was nervous that you'd see my Goldenly Bronzed complexion, and fail to realize that beneath the incredibly tanned skin, was a white boy who loved nothing more than to be stuffed by a Mexican's chorizo. But you didn't judge -- not once. Nope, you were a total gentleman. Instead of forcing it down my throat, you simply put it in my face, and allowed me to pace myself until I swallowed every inch. And I did. I remember being in my UPS truck, thinking about you every time I checked my mirrors and saw the stain you had left on my shirt from the warm juice that had dripped from my mouth. By noon, I was fully aware of the pounding I had taken, because I didn't shit right for a week. But I didn't care, some bubble guts are a small price to pay for what you were putting inside of me. I had to see you again.   Before long, I had completely forgotten about Ronald and that red-headed bitch Wendy. Fuck a Frosty, my mouth was fully committed to you, Federico. God we had some good times, didn't we? But, like all great relationships, we, too, faced some adversity. You know what I'm talking about right? The day of the dog, Remember? I felt as if I was slapped in the face that morning. Let me rewind a little bit.   When the word got out about my new morning routine, my friends and family were against it. They would tell me how bad you are, and you will eventually damage my heart. They even stooped as low as accusing you of putting dog meat into my mouth. FUCKING DOG MEAT! But I wouldn't listen. I was in love and didn't care what anybody had to say. So you can imagine the anger, and sense of betrayal I felt when I pulled up to your drive through, and was LITERALLY greeted by a dog barking in Spanish through the speaker(100% True story). Without skipping a beat, I ordered my Carne Asada. I guess I was so used to pulling up and not understanding a single fucking word anyway, that I just took it in stride. I don't speak Dog or Spanish, so I wasn't even going to ATTEMPT to understand Spanish Dog.  But even that wasn't enough for me to leave you. Maybe my friends were right, maybe you WERE putting your dog meat inside of me. But I wouldn't accept that, so I quickly dismissed that theory, and convinced myself that maybe the dog taking my order was covering the normal woman's shift. What an idiot. But hey, we were young.   Wow, look at me. It's been years since our last rendezvous, yet, you still cause me to nervously ramble. I guess my love for you followed me to San Jose. Anyways, I just wanted to stop by and say hello. And that I can only hope that you miss my mouth, as much as my mouth misses stuffing you inside of it. I love you, Federicos, you're my favorite Mexican.   Forever yours,   Mat√©o
2 Hi.  I'm talking about the one on Peoria and 43rd ave.   The food was great....service not so much.  Everyone was extremely rude....  Customers were served on servers timely manor if they were Hispanic (of which I am not)....  Very poor service.  Will not be eating here again.
5 Great food and prices. Far better pricing and speed than down the street at La Familia which is basically now a loud obnoxious bar, with Mexican food on the side sadly.  Federico's has a lot of daily specials. Check their website for coupons, specials, menus, prices.  Monday AND Tuesday is 99 Cent Tacos (reg. $2.09+) and $1.99 burritos (reg. $3).    they have a nice little salsa bar, but also have red radishes sliced  up, jalepenos, onions/jalepenos julienned.  And they don't ration your salsa or charge extra for to go salsa like La Familia does.  I often find that going inside is quicker than the drive through.  Not sure why. I think everything is made to order, so if someone gets something unusual in the drive thru, it holds up the line.  I wish this was close to my work, I'd go there a lot more. Great combo specials, and very good prices. I like the atmosphere inside, TV in there.
1 Disappointed, was really craving a mexican burrito. I ordered a Pollo Asado burrito and what I got was still raw. The chicken was still pink in the middle! I really don't plan on returning ever.
5 Tried this place on a whim. Drive-thru is what caught my eye! Not very busy... but this is a gem in hiding! I tried the 4 mini tacos for under $4.50 and they were soooo yummy!!! They are a new business but I'm sure once it catches on it's gonna be busy all the time!
3 Open 24!  It's in the hood, no doubt...  The pollo Asado plate is as good as can be! The plate was piled so high with chicken...  I'll be back.
4 I've been to Frederico's twice now (both in Buckeye, AZ). The first time I made a major mistake and ordered three tacos and some chips and beans. This was WAAAAY to much food although the cost was less than $10. The meal was excellent, tasty, hot, and filling. I didn't eat it all but not because it wasn't good ... there was just too much.    My second time at Frederico's I ordered the #1 (tostado, taco, beans, and rice plate).  Very good food with fast service (to go). Although it is considered "fast food" it was the same as you would find in a good Mexican sit down restaurant.
2 The food is ok. Average so a 3 however the attitude is a 1. We ordered the Chicken quesadilla and was charged 1$ more than posted. She said she couldn't do anything and didn't credit the difference. Based on that they get a 2.
3 Good food for value.
