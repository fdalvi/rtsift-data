5 This park is a hidden gem, in my opinion! Its equipment is meant for all ages. There are plenty of swings (baby & normal) , a climbing rope - spider web, a swaying boat, slides, climbing walls, lots of sand, and lots of grass space. There is a large side walk that circles the park for children to ride bikes or scooters. There are several benches to sit which you can usually find one with shade.   There is one picnic table, but I see most people bring blankets to have a picnic in the grassy area that surounds the park.  There are shade canopies over the playgrounds and swings.   It's typically not crowded and if it is, you wouldn't be able to tell since there is so much open space.   I'd say the one downfall is the bathroom facility. It's pretty much what you expect of a "city" bathroom, no soap, no door to the stall, no papertowels. It serves its purpose but I would be sure to bring some sanitizer wipes or something of that nature to freshen up with!
5 This has been one of our favorite parks for years! It is always clean, partly shaded in the summer and has clean restrooms. It doesn't get too packed either which is nice. I love the layout because it is very spacious and open so you can pretty much see your kids no matter where you are standing on the playground. They have a covered ramada too so you can sit and have lunch after the kids are all played out.
5 Beautiful park. Safe. Kid friendly. Pets on leashes welcome. Huge space to play. Shaded, newer playground equipment.
