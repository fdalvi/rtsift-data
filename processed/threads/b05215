5 I am majorly resistant to going to the dentist and have had some good ones and bad ones but I love Dr. Hendrickson's office.  The staff is extremely nice, and every trip from cleaning to a crown has been super FAST, easy, and pain free.  Awesome....
2 The staff is pleasant, but they seem to be more interested in making money off of patients than actually providing dental care.  My husband and I went in for our initial appointments and were charged $200 to have pictures taken of our teeth.  No other work was done, and none of the questions/concerns we had were addressed after bringing them to the dentist's attention.  Additionally, when we tried to schedule a teeth cleaning, we were told it would be a four month wait because they only have a hygienist there one day a week.  I understand being busy, but a four month wait for a standard cleaning?  That's a little ridiculous.
5 Hands down, the best dental office in town.
5 Dr. Hendrickson is great.  So is the hygentisit, Cindy.  I have my teeth cleaned every six months and have no problems getting in.  I have referred several people to his office and they all like him and the staff.  I never feel rushed when I'm there and I am seen at my appointment time.  I think one time I had to wait maybe five minutes.  I have been seeing him for over 5 years now.
