5 This is the best place in town for coffee! She roasts her own beans...so they are never over roasted. Coffee is never bitter. You can have your own label printed and placed on bags, for business owners this is a great plus. The food is delish and so reasonable! Plenty of space to sit and visit with friends. Support this local business owner you won't be disappointed.

4 Enjoyed my visit to this cute little shop. Just ordered a smoothie and it was tasty. The owner was very sweet and friendly. I noticed that the sound really carried and it is such a small space.  There were only two other people there but it was very noisy. Overall a nice place and love to support small local businesses.
3 There is not much to choose from if you are on foot in this part of town.  Daybreak does have decent sandwiches and salads (albeit without much flair).  The proprietors seem earnest and I feel good about supporting them with my business.  Check out the Ham and Cheese on Texas Toast. It was very tasty and freshly made.  I would come here again.
4 fresh roasted coffee...WOW. awesome.  the woman at the front is always very friendly and helpful. I'm shocked this place isn't more crowded in the AM, and for lunch.  Her cinnamon bear claw is delicious!  This place makes me want to throw rocks at S-bucks :)
5 Best coffee I've had in a long time! And the breakfast burrito and homemade almond croissant were incredible!! Thanks Jullie!

5 My boyfriend and I cabbed from Mandalay Bay to get away from eating expensive meals at the hotel.  I found this place on yelp and it was great!  We each got the ham and egg breakfast sandwiches and they were amazing!  My boyfriend kept saying 'the ingredients on the sandwich are in the perfect proportion!"  It was very delicious and the owner was very friendly!  My boyfriend was going to buy 2 waters, and she suggested to drink the filtered water that's fresh - for free!  I would go back in a heartbeat!
1 This place is closed. Don't do what we did which is see its only a mile from the strip and walk it only to find out they're closed. Wa wa waaaaaaaa.
