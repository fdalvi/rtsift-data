3 When I want a fast food burger, the Jack Sirloin burger is my go-to. Chez Jack hits the spot en route to or from a night of revelry. This Jack was fast and friendly, can't ask for more.
1 Food is average, but it's fast food. So whatever. There is a girl who works drive thru who has been on her cell phone talking the last THREE times we have been there. It takes FOREVER to order at the box cause she is responding to her friend or whatever on her cell phone. She is impossible to talk to at the window. Don't even bother asking for sauces. She is AWFUL. Bad attitude also. We come here a lot, but genuinely hope they get rid of her ASAP, or we will drive further to another location.
1 So the sign on the door says it opens at 5 a.m. At 5;05, the door is locked and the one visible employee looks at me, waiting outside, and scurries in back. Bear in mind that I'm dressed for my white-collar job, so I don't look like I'm going to rob the place or like I've been up all night to get lucky.  I call and ask whether the sign is wrong. Gal doesn't know: they'll open in 10 or 15 minutes, maybe. No guarantees. She refuses to give a reason why they can't open on time or why the sign would be wrong.  So the serious plan was to leave a customer standing outside the restaurant for half an hour past the posted opening. Because when you want fast food, an extra 30 minutes is nothing.
