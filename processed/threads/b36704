5 Great service. Honest work at an affordable price. That's hard to find.
5 Great owner-operated shop!  Dave and Mike are certainly about fixing vehicles and not upselling to questionable services, like one finds in so many other shops (especially the chains). Got my work done quickly, done well and at a great price.   Already planning on returning for the other wear and tear items that will need to be addressed soon.
5 Great, honest, gentlemen here at Apex auto. I found them on craigslist after weeks of searching for a reliable mechanic. They struck me as good mechanics so I gave them a try and they were affordable, knowledgeable, and most importantly honest. I have not had the chance to get back but I definitely will take all of my business to them.
1 Dave Dyer promised to sell my car for me, then claimed someone stole the car from him, then took possession of my car, promised to pay me, and never did. I have filed a complaint with the AZ Attorney General and am pursuing legal action against APEX. Do not trust this man, no matter how convincing he may seem about his character and integrity. It's been a very sad situation.
