5 The original Rebel's Pizza is at Smoke Ranch & Jones.  Food is good.  Place is good.  Staff is good.  Price of the cheese pizza dropped back to $3.99.  It's a great place to visit and a great place to get good food!
1 Dont come here. Horrible place.   Sends out ad's saying there are new specials and times, yet i call from 12am to 2am and no one answers. dont waste your time eating here!! How could they have good food when they have horrid customer service and are liar's when it comes to the information put on ad's.
1 TERRIBLE TERRIBLE PLACE.  The food is super sub-par, and the employees are crooks. One of the employees ran my dad's credit card and refused to give him a receipt for the transaction, and when we got home we checked online banking and he had been charged $42 for one pizza. After this revelation, we went back and the guy who charged the card wasn't even behind the counter anymore. Fortunately, the girl at the counter completely cancelled the transaction, and after we described the other customer she revealed it was her brother who did had run the credit card. Way to run a family business. Avoid like the plague.
