5 Sooo U! recently opened across from Pita Jungle.  My husband and I just went in and had a great experience.  They have a really great selection of fashionable, new and gently-used women's and men's clothing and accessories.  The owner, Sylvia, and staff are genuinely friendly but not at all overbearing - just helpful.  We left with a silk suit (with dry clean tag attached) and blouse for me, and two nice shirts for him.  All for about $85.  Check it out!!
5 I love this place! I've been here twice now and walked out with great finds both times. They have a large variety of clothes - work-appropriate & fun cocktail dresses, fabulous shoes, jewelry, casual skirts and shirts, and more. The employees are very friendly and helpful.   Another reviewer mentioned $700 boots, but I haven't seen a single item priced over $100.  I actually got gifts for my cousins, 2 hair and jewelry items apiece, for under $20 per person (and in the same visit found a dress for less than $40 that got me half a dozen compliments at a holiday party that night!)
