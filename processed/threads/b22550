2 I used to frequent this shopping area quite a bit and even set foot in this store when it first opened. It had been busy and I was overwhelmed by the number of people that showed up. I left, vowing I'd come back.  Prior to that my experience with Philosophy had only been in department stores like Nordstrom and Sephora.  I have visited a total of four times and each time, there was such a level of unfriendliness that I encountered, it turned me off the brand completely. I know it sounds petty, but I was never greeted in any of the times I set foot in that establishment. However, the people that came in after me were greeted. When I had questions, I had been rebuffed twice and once I had one of the girls walk to the back and not come out until (it seemed like) I had gone.  On my last and final visit, I came in and was browsing. No greeting...however, when my husband came in, he was greeted. (he had been to the barnes & noble next door)  In the end, I purchased some Philosophy's Hope In A Jar from Sephora...and that product had such an unpleasant smell...It reinforced my visits to their physical store front - unpleasant.  I'm done with Philosophy for good. I know I should never have deviated from my Eminence or Clarins love. Philosophy taught me to stick to the lines that I know and benefit from.
5 I love these products! Very friendly staff! Shauna always calls me and let's me know when their best sales are going on. I tried Philosophy 3 years ago after buying a groupon. My top two favorite products are Purity face wash and The Micro-delivery scrub! They have a brand new firming moisturizer I just bought..... So far I am loving it! Also, you can't go wrong withy the oxygen peel!
