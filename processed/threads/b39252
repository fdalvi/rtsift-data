4 Love this chain of "bars"- this one is located just inside the Rio. Literally, you walk in the front entrance, and it's on your right. Make your selection of about ten different flavors of alcoholic slushies, then pick your cup size, and you're good to go.  Frozen jack and coke is tasty, but the raspberry lemonade is good for strolling around outside too. Extra shots available for $1 to $2, but may not be necessary. Keep your cup for cheaper refills. Personally I found the large party bottles obnoxious and embarrassing, so I'd stick to the 22 oz cups- they're still refillable, and they change colors with the temperature of the drink.  Location is clean and well kept, usually only one person working but they are quick, polite, and friendly.  This was my drinking place of choice during my stay at the Rio- just wish I'd tried it sooner, rather than waiting til halfway through our stay!
5 Boozy slurpees?  Hell, yes!  I really enjoyed my Jack & Coke slurpee.  You can save your glass for a cheaper refill.  On my second go-around, I opted for the frozen margarita with an extra shot.  This is an amazing concept that needs to be in every city in America.  Cheers!
4 The beauty of Vegas when it comes to bars.  Reusing the silly cups.   My girlfriend was feeling parched and so her hero delivered. A pina colada in a tall boy glass.    The ratio of liquor to slushy is really really good at this spot. I was extremely impressed and like I said.. we paid for a great value.. and then all other spots would do cheaper refills for you.  It's spots like this (and the great staff) that make you feel good for spending 15 bucks on a glass you will never use again when you leave.
