1 Worked with them because of the seller's request. It was my first home purchase. Something that should have had a celebratory feel to it did not. The escrow officer was rude, short, unable to explain charges, and only shook my hand once upon meeting with me. They over charged for services they did not provide. Also they did not follow written instructions from my lender about timeline. They ended up causing me not to close on the day their client the seller demanded. If you have a choice at all do not use their services.
5 I have worked with Magnus Title Agency many times and have had nothing but great experiences.  David Epstein is a truly amazing escrow officer that goes above and beyond what others will do to help.  I highly recommend using them during your next real estate transaction.
1 Was forced into working with them at Seller's request. As the Buyer's agent, I expected that since we acquiesced their request, we would have reasonable service. They don't arrange keys to be held or exchanged at their office. They don't order home warranties. Certainly not a title company I will be working with again, nor recommend. It falls short of all expectations, and not full service at all. Unfriendly at most of the turns, and the answer is commonly, "We don't do that."   I've worked with dozens of title companies over the years, and I would not hesitate to run as far as possible from this low-class, low-service operation.
