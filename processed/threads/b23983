4 I recommend the Bacon / Cheddar Egg Sandwich on a Chile Bagel. Also at the top of my list is the Asiago Bagel Dog. The pastries are always a high quality. I suggest the Strudel or the Cinnamon Sticks.
4 I am on a pumpkin kick this month and knew they had the most amazing pumpkin cream cheese. So off I go and get a tub of it for home with a bunch of bagels. I had wanted a pumpkin latte but they dont do the holiday flavors..thats why 4 stars not 5. The flavored cream cheese is so creamy and amazing. I will have to stock up on it before the season is over. I will want more after the holidays. I wonder if you can freeze it? I will have to ask next time. It is so addicting. I am enjoying my pumpkin cravings!! Oh..the bagels are the bomb as well. Crisp on the the outside..soft and chewy inside. Toasted of course!
4 What a delightfully pleasant little cafe to start a day of hiking.   My friend and I were set to go up the Mountains Edge Trails to jumpstart our week with a workout and with that, we knew we needed energy. Einstein Bros Bagels just happened to be on the way so we stopped by and ordered ourselves some food. I ended up with one of their 'egg-citing creations' - the turkey sausage and cheddar with my choice of spinach florentine bagel and a hot chocolate. Delish!!  It had a very friendly, family-oriented ambiance to it although a far cry from sambalatte's more sophisticated & sociable vibe, it brought in the much needed energy for the day and the spinach really helped charge me up!
3 Today I stopped here on the way to Spring Mountain State Park. Before hiking, I wanted a light meal that is inexpensive. The thing is that a bagel with butter and coffee was the only item less than $5. I am not cheap, but spending close to $7 for their average sandwich and coffee is pricey for a bagel shop. I feel that Einstein Bagels would be a better restaurant if they implemented value menus including coffee.     A few times that I have splurged on breakfast here, I have been very satisfied. Their lox sandwich is delicious.     Their coffee is outstanding. Free refills!    The customer service meets my expectations. The nice woman that works here brought my sandwich to the table, which was outside.    My verdict: a good place for breakfast that is kind of overpriced.  Tip: Although this Einstein Bagels has an Eastern Avenue address, it faces Warm Springs Road.
4 Einstein has become a genius.  Einstein Bagels has introduced value to their menu (a complaint I posted in past reviews was a need for value meals) with a Value Breakfast and Value Lunch.    The $3.99 Value Breakfast includes a bagel and shmear with a medium coffee. In bagel lingo, shmear is another name for spread.  I will yelp that my taste buds cherish a toasted bagel with nova lox spread. When it comes to taste, my taste buds also cherish their bottomless coffee. Einstein Brothers Bagels have always served quality coffee. There are four choices of coffee that are unlimited refills.A nice feature is that the time the coffee was brewed is written by the coffee station.    The $5.99 lunch special includes any deli sandwich with a medium fountain drink and chips or potato salad. A lack of a side item was a past complaint that I addressed.    I myself am not a genius. I do have an intuition that Einstein Bagels Value Menus have added to the bagel experience in Las Vegas.
4 Great friendly service. Bagel sandwiches are good and never burned. Love the bagel clusters!!
1 I have always been a regular "bagel eater" at Einstein's but after my last experience, I don't think I will ever go back to this particular one again. From the moment I walked in employees were yelling over counters at each other and one was waving bagels in the air!  When I went to order it went pretty smoothly, but when I got my bagel it was completely messed up. And the two other people there orders were wrong too. They remade mine and I was in a hurry to get where I was going so I left, just to find out that they made mine incorrectly AGAIN!! I was tired of dealing with these people but even if they didn't get my order wrong two times the service alone was enough for me to not go back.
4 I've had Einstein Bros on numerous occasions, bu I've never had anything aside from basic bagels and shmear. I was craving bagel and lox so I met my OG Ryan B for some lunch.   The service was standard, but I got exactly what I was looking for in a bagel and lox with the works. A little on the expensive side, but I was extremely satisfied with my meal and the atmosphere was nice to sit and chat in a quiet location. Free Wi-Fi and free refills makes this a nice quiet place to get some work done as well.
1 Second time back after they messed up our order last week.  Guess what? They messed up our order AGAIN!   Don't even bother going on a Saturday morning at 9:30-10:30, the line was out the door with an poorly trained kid accepting patrons at only one POS terminal (they have three), people were waiting over 10 minutes just to place their order.  Watched a woman yell at the staff because she's been waiting 15 minutes for a "warmed up" coffee cake.  We have gift cards that we bought at Costco since we've LOVED Einstein Bros out of Vegas, I threw them in the trash; I'll never go back. Permanent Fargo Embargo.
1 Very very bad, if you come after 9am don't expect to get any bagels or most of anything. Always sold out. I guess they don't want to make extra because of cut backs.
4 Coffee and bagels! Very good! If you love coffee and bagels and I do you will not be disappointed here! Everything is so fresh, and good quality, if you can think of a bagel and something to put on it (or just order off the menu) you will not be disappointed, I promise. Might have gotten 5 stars, but I would have liked to see the shop just a bit cleaner, not gonna stop me from going back.
5 Always hot fresh bagels, iced chai tea was the bomb! Friendly, fast , always feel welcome by the smiley staff.
4 I always enjoy my food!  I usually have three go to options.... depending on my desire that day....  - a cinnamon raisin bagel with honey almond smear - garlic bagel with reduced fat cream cheese and lox - an applewood bacon with egg breakfast sandwich on a garlic bagel  I LOVE iced coffee, but I hate to say that I am not a big fan of Einstein's iced coffee, it just doesn't have a great flavor to me. Although I do enjoy their hot coffee selection and always choose the vanilla hazelnut!  This location always seems packed, but the staff is very quick and always provides great friendly service!
