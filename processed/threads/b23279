5 I love Carl's Jr. I am a burger lover, and well, when you have tried as many burgers as I have, you know when it's going to be good with the first bite and their six dollar burgers are consistently good every time!   Since I loved the burgers so much I decided to try other items on their menu and I have a few favorites there too! What is especially good about their menu is that it allow me to go low carb if I am watching them (seems it's always a struggle) and the breakfast bowl is great for keeping me satisfied, flavored just right and is most certainly on the low carb menu! So most mornings, I'll be stopping in for the low carb bowl and a large Diet Dr. Pepper!
4 It's hard to write a review of fast food...it all pretty much tastes the same.  So, I am not going to write a review of the food that I threw away...instead, I will write a review of the guy working the counter...He was simply great.   He had suggestions, he had a smile, he was articulate and he remembered my name when handing me my food.   Good job brother!
5 Guacamole 6 dollars burger is awesome!!!
4 I give it four stars The breakfast is very good now. They even have jelly :) But no grape only strawberry that sucks but Its a step up for them. Getting under cooked breakfast meat is never a joy to me when ever I go they have to recook my order. So 4 stars it is.
