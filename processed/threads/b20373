4 I went to St Stephen's yesterday for the first time, even though I'd walked past it a few times (without realising what it was). St Stephen's Centre is at the bottom of Frederick Street, nestled at the end of the Queen's Street Gardens, right before reaching Stockbridge (though my concept of where Stockbridge ends or begins is non-existent).   I went in there to see a show at the Fringe called Apples (which is really awesome, so you should go see it!), and the space was pretty decent. It wasn't small and clammy like most church venues (i.e. Bedlam) can seem. Inside there was also a wee cafe called the Playfair Cafe, with comfy-looking sofas and the sort.   St Stephen's Center hasn't acted as  a church in a while, but is mostly dedicated to being an arts and theatre space.
3 So I went to a Mum & Baby/Toddler group here on a Friday last week....it was OK. I think a lot better for when your wee bairn perhaps hits the 2+ age bracket and they're racing around but if you're bringing a wee baby along it's unfortunately not practical enough. There's no real cordoned off area for people bringing small babies along like there is at St Paul's & St George's. You have the kids racing past you as you're trying to feed or even smacking into their car seat whilst they're sat in it. I think the mum and baby groups are a great idea and lifesaver for those of us who wish to get out and meet people but unless they change it I don't think I'll be going back again. Not for a couple of years at lease. I feel horrible writing this because I know they're setting it up off the back of the donations you give but for the age group my child is at (5 months) there are other places more suitable...
