5 This is a very nice Wells Fargo.  It is nice and big when you walk in and there are plenty of friendly tellers helping customers without hesitation.  This location is near several popular places and also in the same parking lot as a Bank of America.
3 Nice building, but I haven't had any stellar experiences here. Just average. Everyone is very polite, but I did have an issue that I was assured I'd get a follow up call about, and I never got the call. When I went in a second time about the same issue, it was taken care of. Parking lot is small although that's the trend in the entire shopping plaza even though it's an extremely busy area.
5 So I'm in Phoenix dealing with my father's affairs due to his passing. I need to stop by and deposit some money so I find this gem. The staff here are the friendliest I've ever met at a bank. The tell introduces himself, shakes my hand, and is as helpful as it gets. I went there the previous week and had the same experience. This place definitely understands the idea of customer service. If I lived in Phoenix, I would go out of my way to bank here.
5 This branch of Wells Fargo consistently provides me with the best banking experience I've had. Kelvin and his staff are friendly and courteous and understand customer service. Reminds me of how things used to be. Good job Kelvin, keep it up!
1 Tellers there are idiots.  I requested a cashiers check then he insists to give me a money order because the bank says if its under $1k to do so. What do you know I go to close on our house and I do need a cashiers check. Thanks for the knowledgable tellers Wells Fargo.
