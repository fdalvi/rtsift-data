5 Niall Costello of Allodile Construction is probably the friendliest, handiest man I've ever met. Not only is he honest, straightforward, and very talented...He's prompt and affordable too!  He's done all kinds of work for me: Demolition, concrete floor sealing, painting and tiling. He even put up my ceiling fan and fixed my running commode! For lots of my friends he's done big jobs like kitchen & bath remodel, garage additions. I mean, the guy does everything!  And who can resist that sexy Irish accent! This guy is seriously THE dude to hire when you need stuff done around your home or office!
5 I have worked with Niall on several projects personally (at my home) and professionally. He is a top-notch contractor that actually has integrity. I have never been disappointed by his work and would recommend him over and over. He is extremely knowledgeable on all topics having to do with your home improvements. He is a trustworthy guy who won't let you down...he is efficient, affordable and down-right likable...but...he kinda talks funny.
5 Allodile Construction is by far our contractor of choice.  Not only is Niall one of the friendliest people you will meet, his attention to detail, craftsmanship, punctuality, etc. etc. etc. is unbeatable.  As an interior design firm, Allodile Construction is our #1 general contractor for remodeling, additions, and home improvement projects large and small.
1 Tried to get ahold of this dude to no avail. No personal message on his answering machine at all. Website sucks for information to let me know what sorta work or quality thereof he does. I tried to call here @ 6:53pm tonight and again...no one picks up the phone. So fed up with flaky contractors. Do they want work or not?
