4 Good motel although seems to be old. Nice clean rooms and friendly front desk staff.
2 Pro: Cheap, very close to the convention center, free parking, entertaining family business, AC works.  Con: Cheap, you may not survive the night, parking lot full of titty cards  (thank you aaron), the family never leaves, 1950 fallout bathroom. Lack of internet, bring your own aircard. Freaking Chinese cooking with hot plates in their room.  Checked in, was handed keys for front door and room door. Scared. Room was pretty clean, I think... Was worried that my fat ass will send the tub to the first floor. Woken by friends at night of a break in next door, ignored him and went back to sleep, only to see the super fixing a broken door and frame in the morning. Seems like our neighbor were able to get through the front door with their keys, but was too drunk to figure out how to open their door... so they kicked it down and went to sleep, yet to be hauled away by the cops. Good times.  I would stay here again just for the sheer distance to the convention center and the price during CES. But not until the door frame is strengthened...
5 This place was torn down today.... 10/27/2011  Goodbye Somerset!
