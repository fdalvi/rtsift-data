4 Okay so I absolutely am a BIG fan of this store, that being said, I've stopped in often within the last month or so. Each time I've gone the ladies are super friendly, the place has been rearranged; with new stuff added OFTEN, and new and different items on sale. I cannot get enough. The girl here helped me pick out a shirt to go with a really cute skirt I found on sale and she actually had fun doing so, and did not find it to be a nuisance at all! thumbs up.
1 Very disappointed with this place. They do have many pretty things to purchase, but the customer service is terrible. I walked in and neither of the two associates greeted me. Two customers walked in right after me and they were both not only greeted but asked if they could be helped. When i walked out and right passed the sale associate there was again no acknowledgment. I was ready to make a purchase at this store but the customer service really made me reconsider.
4 I always find the cutest dresses here at prices that can't be beat for the look and quality. I get a lot of compliments. The gals that work in the store are so good about suggesting things for me to try on, shoes, accessories, etc. This is my go to store for summer dresses. I wish they would carry more separates (a good selection of tops would make me come even more often).
5 I love this store!   I've never had a problem with rude employees like a previous reviewer did, and I've been there probably 8-10 times.  I always find cute outfits, at a very good price. They don't offer many sizes, but it's a boutique, and that is how boutique shopping is. Their accessories are to die for, and reasonably priced.  I've never had a problem with the quality of the garments. They hold up well in the wash, and last pretty long.
