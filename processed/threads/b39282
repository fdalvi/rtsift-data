5 I chose C & A Landscapes from a phone book.  Yes, a phone book. A heavy object composed of yellow paper!  That is how long José has been taking care of my yard.   He is knowledgeable and honest.  Most of all, he has a true passion for plants, especially desert plants.   (This is huge, since I seem to be incapable of growing even the simplest flower on my own!)  Last summer José asked if he could also take care of my pool.   I said yes, and it was a great decision.  Now my yard work is done synergistically.     As the years have gone on, several neighbors - having seen how trustworthy he is - have also hired José to take care of their yards.   All have thanked me.    Fellow Yelpers, you do not have to pick a landscaper out of a phone book!  That is old school.  Benefit from my experience, and call C & A Landscapes.
5 Great service and decent prices. Very happy that I chose Jose to trim my trees and bushes. Very knowledgable and quick. Very easy to make appointments as well.
5 After several bad experiences with landscapers in the area I am very glad that I found C & A in Yelp reviews.  He is the most knowledgeable landscaper I have ever found.  He understands what our type of plants in Arizona need.  Outstanding work, great prices, on time and professional!  Will never use any other service!
