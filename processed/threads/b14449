5 Very good job. Ordered tires online on Monday night. Tuesday morning I have a voicemail from the store saying the tires will be in late that afternoon, and they will be ready to go for the 8:30am Friday appointment that I scheduled online. I get to the store on friday morning, and the total price in the store is slightly different (the TPMS rebuild kit was $2 less in store compared to what was quoted online). Said it would take 45 minutes, and that's exactly how long it took. The employee I dealt with in-store was very friendly and professional.  Only thing i'm going to do differently next time is just use their website to find the tires I want, then go straight into the store to order them, instead of doing it online. I like knowing the total price up front. Granted, it was only a $2 difference, and $2 less at that, but still. But I definitely will be back. Also, the website makes it look like you are paying for the service online when ordering the tires. You actually just order the tires and have them delivered to the store, the pay when they install them.  BTW... Google maps doesn't give you a very good location with this business (just like most places in Anthem). They are located right on the southeast corner of Anthem Way and 43rd Av / Vision Way.
4 Great Manager
5 Great service great staff.  My fianc√© had an issue with a rim on a BMW that was cracked and the team at discount tire really went out of their way to get things fixed.   I won't go anywhere else for tires.   Great work and thank you.
5 The management here is awesome, won't buy tires anywhere else as long as these guys are running the place!
5 I just bought a used car and there was a nail in the tire. I brought it here and they did a flat repair for free and got me right in. I will never go anywhere else. Great service
5 Always great service. Employees are friendly, professional and funny. They are quick and always answer your questions. They take their time with their customers.
