4 If you can handle the mind-jarring music, Styles for Less has some great bargains to be had.   Lots of bright, trendy clothing and accessories. They had hats and shoes, plus belts, beads, & bags. Tons of fun and funky flip flops (Oh, don't-cha just love alliteration!).  We found the same dresses we hade just seen at a mall store for $40-50 for only $19.99. They also have piles and piles of tanks and camis perfect for summer's layered styles. They ran 2 for $10 and 2 for $14.  This store made both my daughters' and me very happy :)
4 This is the perfect place for teens to shop for trendy and comfortable styles at REAL comfortable low prices!  My daughters and I love finding boutique items at discount prices! It's amazing! We saw a blouse at a boutique for $50 and bought it here for $20! Can't beat it!   And their clearance racks are the best! Don't sleep on this place - you'll miss out on savings!  Friendly staff. Usually very helpful. Lots of promotions and sales going on year round.
