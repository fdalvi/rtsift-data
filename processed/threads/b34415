5 Best dog food prices in the valley! The toys are not too badly priced either. The staff is very knowledgable about high end dog food and always available to help. They also offer the 10th bag of dog food for free with some select brands. They have been helpful for me with selecting a good quality food that is reasonably priced for my pups who I treat like me kids. It means a lot!
4 The dog food prices are very affordable and beat the large stores (PetSmart & Petco) by quite a bit.    Also, I really like that they specialize in quality food instead of the cheap, conveniently found food that is really dangerous to pets (like Kibbles & Bits, Ol Roy, etc.).   I approve!
5 Love the staff and the selection. I wish there was a location a little closer to my house, but that's ok.  The staff has recommended a raw diet for my very itchy, allergic Boston Terrier.  It was an instant hit.  He had none of the typical tummy trouble associated with switching food.
4 Great local pet store with great options. Small location but they carry the essentials. A bit higher priced but to be expected with a smaller locally owned store. I'd pay the extra few bucks to go to a locally owned vs. a corporate America store. Friendly staff and great service!
4 What a great store and awesome products.  Natural pet food, two aisles of snacks and treats, staff is very knowledgeable on all of the products from dog food, snacks to brushes and products.  This place is big with lots of dog and cat products to choose from, they even have the 3 Dog Bakery snacks, bulk dog cookies and snacks they sell by the LB. Sale on dog beds for very reasonable prices.  Our dog loved the bully sticks (these were the 'non-stinky' kind) she chewed that up in a few days! Whatever you may need, they have it here, this is not your Petco or PetSmart. Reasonable prices, lots of variety.
