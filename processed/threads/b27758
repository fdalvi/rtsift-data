5 I tried this on a recent trip to Las Vegas and will definitely try to find my way back on my next visit.  I think this is rather new but there is a decent selection of taters with toppings. I got chili and cheese and it was super yummy! I also got the dinner salad and it was pretty yummy too.  The only problem was the size of both: they were huge! Along with the portion sizes were the prices, which are high because of the portions. I would rather love to see an option to get half a tater with a smaller portion of salad as I don't want to fill up only on a potato, no matter how yummy it is.  The seating is very limited and there are no options for kids, something they really need to add. I also hope to see more topping selections, like pepperoni pizza, added over time.
4 The patatos are awesome!! They are big and deliscious. Prices aren't too high but they're not too cheap either. I love the southwest chicken potato it's blissfull lol. The smoothies are deliscious too. It's really cute inside very clean and nicely decorated. Also the staff is really cool and when you go in there's a good chance you will run into the owners they're nice too. It's a great lunch or dinner idea.
2 So wanted this to be good! But it wasn't. Chili was dog food. Literally from a can and awful. Cesear salad was good but chicken was overseasoned. Menu is too generic. Love fresh food n could use a change from tropical smoothie but it is not good enough....yet.
4 I went here on 5/23 and had the fajita potato. It was amazing! I haven't ever had a jumbo topped potato so I was thourghly surprised. My only complaint is that you can't combo a potato and salad but the price was right, service and food excellent!
