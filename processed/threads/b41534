5 So amazing!! I went in my appointment was at 1:50 pm. I was actually seen on time and the appointment was so quick and stress-free. It's so hard to find a good gynecologist in Nevada it seems. Well I will look no further! Very comfortable and relaxing atmosphere. After a horrifying experience at the last gynecologist I went to, this was such a sigh of relief.. I'm actually looking forward to my yearly exam next year ^.^
5 My wife had a medical problem for a year: we even took a long trip to  another state to see a  specialist. Nothing would help, luckily we were able to  see Dr. Farmer, after a few visits she was able to solve her problem. Dr Farmer gave my wife her life back. She is a  Angel. She is a truly amazing person.
1 I was so embarrassed,  the nurse I spoke with before I saw the doctor stood outside the door and told practically every one why I was being seen. The doctor and this nurse stood out there and discussed my personal reasons for being there. I put the wrong date in one spot, I guess that made their day because it seemed to be the joke I was the youngest obgyn patient ever seen. When I walked out the room I felt so humiliated. It was painful enough being there for my reasons,  but to have it discussed out in the open with the whole office was like adding salt to a wound.
