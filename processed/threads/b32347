5 There is some serious value going on at this new steakhouse at the Riviera.  New ownership took over this hotel, I believe in April.  Since then they've made some impressive changes.  Everything is cleaner and much easier to navigate.  Anyways, on to the food.  Marks of good food preparation are proper seasoning and cooking to the right temperature.  "R" hits both those right on the head.  The scallops we had would be right at home in top restaurants.  Great seasoning, great sear, and cooked to a perfect temperature.  Cooked all the way through but just barely.  Really impressive for a place that isn't really supposed to be a high end steakhouse (they don't have prime grade steaks there.)  Oysters were fresh and fantastic.  Served with a nice dipping sauce.  I really couldn't believe I was enjoying a meal at the Riviera (it's kind of strange to even see me write that) but I was.  On to the steaks - of course I had the bone ribeye.  Yeah baby.  That's what I'm talking about.  Juicy, well marbled, and cooked to medium rare just as I requested.  Seasoned beautifully.  No, it wasn't a prime steak but it was pretty darn close to what you'd get at a premium steakhouse but for about 1/3 of the price.  Really nice.  Garlic mashed potatoes were solid.  Garlicky and buttery with a nice consistency.  The creamed corn was also great - a nice vibrant color as well.  Hopefully the other places to eat at Riviera catch up to this new steakhouse.  Just opened a few days ago but service was very good already.  PS - forgot to mention the bread they start you with.  Waiter rolls out his tray with a nice big loaf and starts scoring it for you so you can tear it apart with your hands.  Served with 3 different kinds of butter.  The bread, I kid you not, was as good as you'll get at all but the highest end 2 and 3 star Michelin restaurants and comparable to all the 1 star Michelin places I've dined at.
3 Great wait service! Food took forever, though. Portion size was quite large.  You will not leave hungry.  Three different butter's for the fresh bread was a nice touch.  My wife had the short ribs.  As I mentioned, she got three very large and tender ribs.  However, she was not crazy about the wine sauce.  I had the sirloin steak.  It was a very thick and large steak cooked just like I ordered it. However, it had some kind of rub or coating on it that I was not crazy about.  It had a strong rosemary taste.  My baked potato was ok; skin was tough and it was only lukewarm.  My wife's Mac n cheese was good, but different; a unique type of cheese is used to make it.  The salad we had with cranberries, walnuts, bacon, and feta cheese was probably the best part of the meal.  In all, we spent $60 for the two of us; no alcohol and no dessert.  I think it was more costly than it was worth.
5 This place deserves more than five stars, it was excellent to say the least.  Started out with a fat tire beer when they brought bread out. The beer and the bread hit the spot and I quickly noticed the service was very attentive and it seemed like a very nice place, I could tell that it was newly remodeled because everything looked new from the tables to the floor.  We then got an appetizer, the scallops. Oh my oh my these were excellent to say the least. they were wrapped in bacon and melted in your mouth cooked to perfection. Best scallops I have had for quite some time. Next, we ordered steaks, they were excellent too to say the least. I had the filet and it was cooked to perfection. The best steak I had for quite some time, better than Mortons or Ruth Cris.  After that I got another fat tire and we left.   What made this all the better was that I had a groupon and this meal which would have been well over $100 came up to about $20 after tip and paying for the groupon, you can't beat value like that.   Highly recommended!
5 Really excellent food,service and value.We came here with a groupon,even without it,it would have been a great deal.We had a 6.30 reservation,seated quickly,bread and 3 types of butter,great start.Really pigged out and ordered way too much,but was expecting the usual (tiny) steakhouse appetisers and sides,All were excellent,but the star was the bone in rib eye.Juicy,perfectly seasoned and cooked (medium rare),tasted better than any other steak I have had,and I have had prime cuts twice before.The sides were at least twice the size of any other place I have been and just as good.Great old school service from waiters who I am sure have been doing this for years.Will be a regular place for me every time I visit Vegas.So jealous of you guys who live there to have this place,compared to the over hyped,over priced joints we have in San Francisco!
5 This place was a surprise. I got a Groupon for a dinner and a show and was not expecting much at all. I especially wasn't expecting superb service and gourmet food! This place is outstanding. Even without the Groupon, the prices are very humble. Everything we got was delicious.  We were seated immediately as it was not very crowded on a Monday night.  Our server was cool. He looked like the sidekick from Quantum Leap. Very attentive and helpful with the menu. He recommended the Scallpos for an appetizer and we were sure glad he did. They were phenomenal. Biggest scallops in the ocean onto my plate, seared perfectly with a miso butter sauce that was divine.  Warm spinach and bacon salad was delicious. Just wish it was bigger for sharing. My wife got mad that I ate it all so quick.   If you have the word steak in your restaurant in Vegas, you have a lot of pressure to deliver. R Steak & Seafood did just that. Porterhouse was cooked perfectly and tons of great flavors.   So I thought with a Groupon, the drinks would be like "Vegas specials". Wrong. Good size drinks with good pours.
4 We enjoyed dinner at R.   The Riviera is not the trendiest or flashiest  place on the strip, but don't overlook this restaurant.  The service was excellent and the food was very good.  While items are prices ala carte, the serving sizes were more than ample to justify the price.    Thanks to Groupon for providing us the opportunity to try something new in Las Vegas.
3 This restaurant is perhaps the best thing the Riveria has going for it. The food was perfectly done, the decor modern and comfortable and the prices were in line with Vegas. I had the filet mignon which had a wonderful seasoning on it, asparagus, and the tempura fries. Everything food wise was done very well. The service was hit or miss. Our waiter was very nice when he did come around. Cool note: the steak knives look like switchblades.  The restaurant fails in the fact that for the price I could have gotten the same or better meal elsewhere. The Riveria is very far north on the strip and at night does not lend an air of safety to the place. Finding the restaurant was near impossible since the signs in the the Riveria have not been updated and the place is a labyrinth. Hint: it's on the east side of the pool. Afterwards, trying to find a cab stand proved near impossible (it's in the basement!).   If you're staying near/at the Riveria or have a taste for adventure then I would recommend going there. Otherwise you could have just as good a meal elsewhere without having to brave a seedy casino.
4 I had a good deal, and decided to visit this new steakhouse at the edge of the Strip. It's a bit far in the back of the hotel, so you might have to ask for directions. If you're staying at the Riviera, I think it's much easier to find since it's by the pool entrance and tower elevators.  Fried Calamari- 3.5-stars- Crispy, breaded calamari. Very soft, tender pieces. Each piece is bite-sized, served with lemon and a saucer of cream. The batter is lightly flavored. It's hard to tell this is squid, because it's cut into such small squares. There's no legs or other parts to give away it's identity. You get a good sized portion of this. So you can eat it like little popcorn squid.  Thai Coconut Seared Mussel- 4-stars- You get a giant pan of over a dozen mussels in a shallow layer of the coconut sauce. You really want to scoop it up and suck it out with the mussels. There are also slices of bread seeped with the sauce. I think you'll have table bread which is also good to dip in with. Overall, the flavor is excellent. Of course, each mussel comes with it's own tiny plate--the shell. I should note, because it is Thai, it is a little spicy!  Miso Seared Scallops- 4.5-stars- The dish itself is beautiful. You get three huge scallops. They're juicy, lightly sweet, and very soft and tender. This is definitely a must for seafood or scallop lovers. It just breaks apart, like warm butter. I also liked the sauce a lot, which I tried to scoop up with the pieces of seaweed on the platter. Another good place to use your table bread.  10 oz. Filet Mignon- 5-stars- I ordered this Medium Rare. The meat is utterly soft and flavorful. I don't know what their special rub is, but it's just bursting with taste. It brings to mind a mixture of caramel flavors, cumin and sea salt. The top is seared to perfection being both crispy and crunchy. Although a little small for the size, it just explodes with delicious, mouth-watering flavor. This is definitely a must try!  Ambiance- It is set up with some luxury, dimly lit with nice, comfy chairs. The seating is far enough apart and varied enough to allow parties of different sizes. Even though it's a new location, and relatively hard to find, it was filled up when I arrived.  Service- They are very generous here, friendly and helpful--which is actually rare in Vegas. We had several personal issues come up during the dinner, which quite embarrassed me, but they deals with our problems immediately and as professionally as possible. Food came in decent waves, allowing us to enjoy one plate for a a little while, before a second plate arrived.  Conclusion- My total bill came out, with two beer, well over one-hundred dollars, which was a little high for me. I hadn't eaten all day, so I was starving, and my mother, whom I came with--it was her birthday--had to leave suddenly. So I was left to finish most of the food. I was filled, but not overly stuffed. The steak, for the size, was delicious but maybe a little pricey--I'm not an expert on steaks, just yet. Everything else was delicious and reasonably priced.
4 The bone in rib eye was excellent. Every bit was middle rare and not overlooked. Steak was very tasty, specially around the bone.  As much as I love salt, I think it was a bit over seasoned though. The cream of spinach rival Lawry's.  The creme brûlée was very creamy as well. Very reasonably priced in Vegas.
4 Me and my buddies were kind of hesitant with these place considering that it is in one of the oldest hotels on the strip, the Riviera. However, Yelp helped us make the decision, and boy were we happy.  This is your classic and essential steakhouse, no fancy bull, just a good ol' steak.  The bread is excellent, fresh baked.  I tried the french onion soup, solid. And then I had the 10oz filet mignon, ordered it medium rare and it was just perfect. The sides though could use a little tweaking, but you come here for steak not fillings.  All in all, it was a good experience and If ever we go back to Sin City, we will be paying a visit.
3 Not sure how I feel about this place. Went twice for dinner and loved it - good food, not too expensive, nice atmosphere. Yesterday we went for happy hour and it was not a good time. The bartender was rude from the start. He took forever to pour us wine and then, when we asked for the dinner menu in addition to the bar snacks menu, he basically yelled at me that I had to pick one or the other OR HAVE 2 CHECKS. I do not care how many checks I have, I'd like to order what I want to eat when I go out. He then took the bar menu and tossed it out of my reach while he thrust a dinner menu at me. When we wanted a second glass of wine it took 11 minutes to get his attention (2 other people at bar.) And when our food arrived I had to get up to ask for napkins, silverware and salt. He never checked or even thought that a fork might be appropriate for a salad. I will never return to the bar but I might go back for a nice meal in the dining room. AWFUL BARTENDERS CHASE LOCALS AWAY!
5 This is by far the best steak I have ever had. If we had gone to this steak house our first night in Vegas, we probably wouldn't have eaten anywhere else.
4 Excellent food at outstandingly low prices. This is a hidden gem inside the Riviera hotel. Generous wine pour. Huge steamed muscles. Delicious NY strip. YUM! Very friendly service.
3 This place would have gotten 5 stars if we didn't have a shitty waiter and my friends ribeye wasn't pure fat and undercooked twice.  Yes yes yes, i know i know... Ribeyes have fat.  This steak was 3/4 marble.  I also ordered a ribeye and mine was perfect.    We were seated almost instantly.  We ate two loaves of bread before we saw our waiter.  No water, no drinks... Just amazing bread.  After we asked the hostess where our waiter was, we got prompt service.  French onion was amazing.  Salads looked good. My ribeye was perfect.  Friends ribeye was pure fat.  We couldnt find our waiter to let him know.  My dad was done with his meal before the waiter came to check on us.  Friend got the strip instead.  It looked perfect but it was pretty rare.  Rarer than med rare and he ordered it medium.  He ate half of it.  I took the other half back to my room and ate it a few hours later.  Bottom line. This is the best thing at the riveria.  In fact, i thought the riveria would suck and it ended up being a very pleasant experience.  One day i will bring my wife here and i will update this review to 5 stars.  I was impressed but incredibly disappointed by my server and my friend for ordering a steak at medium..  Thats blasphamy in its own right.
1 It was closed!  At one o'clock!  What a disappointment.
3 This is a relatively new restaurant located in the space occupied for many years by Christopher's.  The restaurant is fairly casual though there was a maitre d.  We shared a warm bacon and spinach salad.  Ann ordered the grilled salmon steak entrée which was bountiful and very moist.  Mine was a mammoth double, more likely a triple, cut pork chop with an apple cranberry sauce. We also shared a bowl of roasted cream corn.  Prices were moderate for a Strip restaurant of this quality.  I was able to use a 2 for 1 entree coupon from the Las Vegas Advisor.  A rating of 3.5 would be most accurate.
5 The manager of the resturant gave me a call after reading my review of this place.  That blew my mind.  In the years I've writing reviews for Yelp, I never had an actual establishment call me to personally apologize for the terrible service.  He said next time I am in town I should try them again.   That I will definitely do.
5 Amazing!!!! If your debating on going (like I was) please try this place! I eat around an awful lot. I've tried many restaurants and this place definitely was at the top of my list!! The surf and turf was delicious. The steak cooked perfectly! Lobster was to die for! Started off with complimentary bread and 3 different butters! Wonderful!!! Ordered a bacon appetizer and was very pleased! The Mac and cheese side was very fresh! Also ordered a few more sides to try! The only thing I wasn't find of was the Brocolini.. It wasn't much my taste! The staff was very helpful & friendly! Would reccoment this place to ANYONE! Pay them a visit.. You won't be disappointed :)
5 Had a wonderful dinner with family and friends. My hubby had the Prime Rib which was perfectly rare and wonderful. I opted for appitizers, steamers and Lobster Bisque. Both were fabulous. Everyone else raved about their steaks. Our server was terrific.Definitly will go back next trip!
4 Ate here while staying on business at the Riviera. The service was prompt and helpful. I had the 6oz filet mignon, ordered medium rare. It arrived as ordered. The bread came with plain, red pepper, and garlic butters.   A excellent meal, but the price was a bit steep; I've had as good for less at chain steak houses.
5 This place was just what I was looking for! My boyfriend and I were there on our last day in Vegas (Sun.) I had promised to take him to a good steak house for some good steak and saw this place was in our own hotel. Checked out some of the reviews and decided to give them a try, we were both very pleased.  Place/ service:   It's really nice. I think they had just remodeled a few months before our visit in June.  There was no wait, I was surprised. I did call to make a reservation, one hour before, but if we had just walked in I think we would have been fine.  Our waiter was nice and was always checking on us, making sure everything was to our liking.   Food:  They served us water and soon after brought out freshly made bread with three different kinds of butter. As an appetizer we got calamari. For dinner I ordered a rib eye steak and my boyfriend had a fillet Mignon, both came with mashed potatoes. Everything was very good..   We really enjoyed this place. It made a great place to have our last date in Vegas and I was happy that my boyfriend enjoyed it, as I had promised to take him to a good steak house. We will be returning.   Enjoy!
3 This place is pretty good. But could be better for the price. The best thing we had was the habanero honey wings, which had a nice kick, they were sweet and spicy just like I like. I ordered the burger and my fiancé ordered the swordfish and baked mac n cheese. Our food was pretty good... But I think my burger could've been better, I ordered the R Fries with it which were also pretty good but could've used some seasoning.  We had a groupon which was helpful, otherwise, be prepared to pay because everythig here is a la carte.  Would I take that long taxi ride to come back to this place? Probably not.
5 Hands down the best Groupon I have ever bought. If not for the great Yelp reviews I would have passed, simply because it seemed too good to be true.   The Groupon was $45 for two tickets to the Riviera Comedy club and $70 worth of dinner at R Steak & Seafood. Crazy, right?   Our waiter was awesome. Bobby, as he liked to be called, was energetic and all too happy to please while not being too overbearing. Perfect waiter!  I had the 10 oz. filet, asparagus, and sauteed mushrooms. All were perfectly done and as I type this I am suddenly overwhelmed with a craving for all three!  Hubby got some pasta thing that he loved but I didn't care about because I was too busy with my meal.   The bread served was tasty and I ate nearly the whole loaf myself. I really liked the three kinds of spread, although the red pepper cream cheese was the best.   The food, including one beer for the old man, came out to us owing just $4. So now our meal and show was only $49? Oh man. The waiter totally deserved the huge tip we left.   ***Word of caution: Although the site lists this place as 'casual', I suggest you not show up in a tank top or a halter dress like we did. It felt kind of awkward and I apologized profusely to the host. He was kind about it though because it is casual, just not as casual as us :)
1 Where do I start? We had reservations for 9pm and we arrive on time to find out that there is a 45 minute wait to be seated because the "kitchen is behind". No apology offered by the hostess. The place closes at 10pm and it didn't even look busy at all. We weren't guided to the bar or offered any alternative so we went over to the bar and ordered ourselves drinks. At about 9:30 the five of us were finally brought to our table. We sat there for 10 minutes before a male waiter, we'll call him "Perry" because he never told us his name, came over and took our drink orders, and eventually our entree orders as well. He never offered any specials or featured dishes. My girlfriend ordered a salad and asked for blue cheese instead of feta and was met with a flat response by "Perry" of "Um, I'll ask" and had this bewildered look on his face. After we ordered, we never saw him again. The busser brought us bread and we had to ask him for water after the table next to us was seated about 30 minutes later and they were brought water immediately. We waited 60 minutes for our food to arrive and during that time we never saw 'Perry". This prompted my friend, who's got 17 years in hospitality industry, to find a manager. He didn't find a restaurant manager but found a hotel manager who listened to our complaint and offered us a round of drinks on the house. Our food finally came and immediately noticed that the steaks were room temperature and my steak was rare instead of medium as I asked. All our steaks were dry. We also noticed that the table next to us, who were seated about 30 minutes after we were, had gotten their meal immediately after ours was brought out. Going to this joke of a restaurant was a waste of our time and even made worse that I had to leave a review like this taking more time off my life that I'll never get back. Don't let it happen to you. Avoid this place at all costs.
5 The R Steak and Seafood restaurant is truly a diamond in the rough.  The Riviera may be on of the older hotels on the strip, and yes, a bit out of the way from all the fun of the strip, but we were  pleasantly surprised when we took a recommendation to try out the  R Steak and Seafood Restaurant.  They exceeded all of our expectations.  Absolutely great customer service since the moment you walk up to the waiter and meeting the chef.  My husband ordered their rib eye and I ordered the filet mignon.  They prepared it not just to our liking, but the presentations was absolutely a piece of art!  One of the best steak house meals I have ever had and we have gone out quite a lot all over the country.  It is an ala cart menu, so do be prepared to spend a little bit more than the average restaurant but the experience and the food are 100% worth every dollar!
5 My husband and I had a great dinner.  The steak was as good or better than others.  The caramel and apple cheesecake was excellent also.  The portions of the sides are shareable.
3 On our second visit, we started off by ordering a bottle of Liberty School cabernet sauvignon.  For appetizers we shared orders of crispy battered calamari and miso butter seared scallops.  The calamari were sliced lengthwise into wide strips that were both tough and flavorless.  We faired better with the scallops which were previously frozen but very good.      For entrees we each ordered 6 ounce filet mignons and requested that they be prepared medium rare, but were actually served closer to medium.  Our sides of grilled pencil asparagus had little discernable flavor and the garlic mashed potatoes were garlic-lite.  We also shared a (not) warm bacon salad that included onions, hard boiled egg and mushrooms. We have had similar salads many times and this one comes up short in the flavor department.        We concluded this feast by each ordering, no sharing thank you, crème brulees with berries and Godiva chocolate hazelnut coffees (French blend coffee, Godiva chocolate and Frangelico liqueurs topped with whipped cream). Both were very good though the coffee should have been hotter.  I used a $150 comp that I won in a contest against the bill, much to the amazement of our server, that came in at precisely $150. That is what is called pre planning.
1 DISAPPOINTING!!! I read the reviews here on "R" so we took our family for dinner. It was very pricey but we had heard such good things we thought it would be worth it. Unfortunately, it was not. I had a $26 ribeye (sides are separate). The steak was flavorless and very fatty. My brother had a filet medium rare that was actually half medium and half well done. My mom had the spinach bacon salad which was ok. The wine list was way overpriced- $30 for a bottle of Kendall Jackson Chardonnay! We ended up with a $250 tab by the time dinner was done. Service was ok, waiter friendly but it took more than half hour to get our food. If you're going to have a nice dinner out and spend some bucks this is not the place to go.
4 **Summary**        - Decor - It has wooden floors and with a nice upscale seclusion about it. Other than the fact that it's next to the pool, it would be a perfect date place.        - Service - The wait staff was charming and funny. We had ordered the Filet medium rare and it came a bit too cooked. The waiter took it back immediately and made a couple jokes as damage control. I think he handled it excellently.        - Food - The steaks are grilled to perfection and the sides are brimming with butterly flavor. **Ordered**        - Breads and assorted butters - They bring your bread with 3 different butters to choose from. It adds a unique touch to the normal artisan breads.        - $8 Caesar Salad - It's different than your traditional caesar salad. It's pretty much two large stalks of lettuce on a plate with their cheddar waffer as a cruton. I liked it.        - $26 Filet Mignon 6 oz. - Juicy and tender, but at 6 ounces, it's very tiny.        - $36 Porterhouse 24 oz. - Grilled just right with a buttery taste in every bite. I ended up using some of the butters from the bread they gave us earlier, but I think that was overkill.        - $7 Sauteed Mushrooms - Very rich with butter. They tasted so good and you know they're terrible for you. **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice dinner out.
4 My parents and I were staying in the Riviera for three free nights off my mom's comps and we wanted to get some dinner for my bday. I wanted to try a steakhouse and since we were at the Riviera might as well try there steakhouse. I am SOOO glad that we decided to try this place because it was DELICIOUS!  The ambiance was very nice, the servers was excellent, the maitre d was on point when it came to go around and checking on people.   I ordered the Ribeye steak medium and it was DAMN GOOD, my dad got the prime rib. He enjoyed it and my mom got the fish which she couldn't stop talking about.   Since it was my birthday I got an ice cream mountain...this dessert was delicious.  All in all, I am glad we chose this place to celebrate my birthday while in Vegas.
4 We had a large party after my daughters wedding with a set menu. One of my gripes is that they tried to change the deal at the last minute, but with one phone call from my husband things went back to normal. The French onion soup was great, terrific in fact. The prime rig was a very generous portion and the service was attentive. They even allowed us to bring in our own cake and provided the service for that.. BIG Kudos for that. We went back for their late night Happy Hour and it was fantastic. Everyone was very friendly and the decor was beautiful. I would highly recommend  this place for a large event as well.
5 The Riv redid their steakhouse last year and I have not had the chance to check it out until recently. They did an excellent job. The atmosphere is a world of difference than the run down casino. You don't feel like you are in the same building.   I went with a friend. We both split the Seared Scallops and the Pear and Endive Salad. Both were excellent. Giant Scallops! We ordered the Aged New York Strip and  Aged Rib Eye. Ordering a rib eye 'blue' may have been a mistake. The steak knife had trouble cutting the meat. Do yourself a favor and order the Chimichurri sauce. It is delicious. I ordered a side of Asparagus which I wish would have been a little larger pieces.   We ordered the swan for desert. The swan is a little ridiculous. It is basically a giant creme puff with ice cream. I would recommend a different appetizer.   We had a couple drinks as well and the bill came out to a modest 150. If you are looking for a wet aged grass fed kobe steak I would head farther south down the strip. If you are looking for a great meal with excellent value head over to riv and give this place a try.
3 Go here quite a bit....Everything is very good here (but not as good as The Steakhouse at Circus Circus).   Good bread and flavored butters Filet was decent quality but certainly not the best I have had Everything is extra Good appetizers Very good, but pricey drinks Happy hour is kinda lame as the choices are few Good wait staff  My main issue with this place is that they raised prices AT LEAST 3 times in the last 18 months, so the value here seems to be getting less each time. ...But still cheaper than most steakhouses on the strip for now.  I like this place but it's no longer the bargain it used to be. So I will go here when my better choices are booked up.
5 This review is for their amazingly delicious happy hour! 5$ for a bowl of steamed clams, oysters on the half shell, habanero wings or a tray of sliders. Unbelievable! The server was tops! He was so friendly, informative, checked up on us regularly.  Best thing about the Riviera is this hidden gem. Dont stay at the hotel but definitely eat there! and then leave.
4 I'm a very picky steak person so if a restaurant says it has great steak, it had better have it. They had great steak here and I would totally go again. Tasty salads as well. I thought the sides were a bit small but overall great.
1 We wanted to clarify the use of a coupon before we ordered,the new waitress wasn't sure so she called the acting manager over and she explained to us how the coupon could be used. However when the bill came , it was quite different than what was said. The dispute was a $16.00 difference of a $80+ bill. Twenty minutes later another manager  Came and was curt and rude and refused to honor the commitment of 1st manager/waitress. The managers treatment was unacceptable. Be careful when using a coupon at this restraurant.
5 OMG, their Happy Hour food is awesome! We were originally going to go to the seafood buffet at Palm, but it was getting too late to go there. So, we sort of reluctantly went downstairs (We stayed at Riviera since it was bargain price.) to check out R's late Happy Hour from 9pm. That turned out to be an great choice. We had:  Steam Clams (Mmmm!!), Serrano Honey Chicken Wings, R Steak Sliders.  When u r on a budget, forget about overpriced food at all those new hotels on the Strip. Go to R's Happy Hour! ;D
3 For the price, the food was not bad at all. Nice presentation, decent meal overall. Ambiance at this place is terrible. There was a table of people yelling and laughing and talking so loudly, we could barely talk. It's definitely not the fancy restaurant it's trying to be, people were not dressed up even the slightest. Its a shame because the décor is great, waitress was nice and the food has some potential. Just missed the mark and seems like it needs to figure out what it wants to be. Definitely not the place to go if you are looking for a romantic dinner. Luckily we were able to move tables mid meal- unfortunately you couldn't get far enough away from that group as you could hear them throughout the entire restaurant. Was it horrible? No, but would I ever go back there? definitely not. It was just meh all around.
4 The only shining gem at the Riviera.  Seriously.  Their happy hour deals are amazing. I didn't get a chance to try their actual restaurant. We were ushered to their bar area for their happy hour.  We got there right when it started, around 5 and sat at the bar and immediately ordered wings and sliders. They were pretty good and fell in love with these little things.  After a few beers we sent text messages to the rest of our crew to join us.  The bar was pretty empty but an hour later the place was full to capacity.  We ordered more wings, sliders, oysters and the chips. The chips weren't my favorite... even though they're homemade, they tasted a little burnt.  The price for beer was great. I think we paid less than $40 for everything we ate and drank.  In one of my most brilliant decisions, I jumped in the pool right after. 2 people who joined us after the fact that we ate and drank came through and I told them to go to the bar and sit with Manuel who was our bartender and cool as all hell.  So yeah, give this place a shot, if not for the reastuarant (which looks delicious, BTW) then at least for the appetizer specials they got going on.
4 This is the high end restaurant at the Riviera.  It's moderately priced and quite fair compared to it's peers at the larger hotel casinos and for the price, portion and quality the R STEAK & SEAFOOD can go toe to toe and head to head against other restaurants of maybe higher prestige and brand name recognition.  I'd actually make a specific trip to The Rivera just to eat at R S&S.  I stayed at The Riviera this trip, so it was a convenient place to eat.  What a surprise 'tho !!!  This is an amazing restaurant.  If you're a lone traveler for business, they serve the full menu at the bar / pub which has TV's or in the dining area.  The Prime Rib is so awesome, maybe one of the best I've ever had.  The crab cakes are also excellent and amongst the best I've had.  The service is generally good and gracious.  The bar area can get crowded and maybe too much for the short staff to serve with speed.  The restaurant has good service that's attentive.  The front restaurant host reception area fell short a bit, routing people to the bar over the restaurant.  An avg meal here is probably $40-60 per person w/ an appetizer, main course and a drink... so that's a pretty decent bargain for Vegas when it comes to a quality steakhouse.  Keep in mind, I'm comparing R S&S to SW Steakhouse, Cut,  The Palm, Morton's, Ruth Chris, Carnivore, Delmonico's, Smith and Wollinskiys, and Prime Steakhouse... and I'm saying this provides comparable value at 1/2 the price of it's peers.
1 Atmosphere was ok. They forgot part of the order and the seafood we ordered was very fishy tasting, like it wasn't fresh. I would skip this place.
5 Delicious! Came here for happy hour and ordered the riviera sliders (6$) comes with 3 sliders and 12 mussel, in a broth filled pot along w garlic bread (6$) both were really really good, friendly bartenders as well!
5 Had salmon, NY steak, rib eye, and filet minot. Unlike most restaurants on the strip, you get a salad and potato choices included. Great food at a good value without the hassle of the strip. Inside word is there's a new chef who is making things MUCH better!
2 Highend not likley great decor. Service no bueno sorry guys. Hostess super cool. Our first waiter said he would take our order only if we placed it Quickly. WTH RIGHT. My bf and roomie ordered steak and mashed potatoes. Friend also ordered Caesar salad. Me asparagus and losbster soup (very fishy and bland) it took almost 1hour to receive our dinner yes well done steak request take longer but an hour and not one person came to let us know status. Sad. I never expected this awful service. I have dined at, mastros by my home in LA and would NEVER get this bad service.  Hour later dinner arrives oh and guess who makes a guest appearance our new waiter.  Food is ok and we did not see waiter until we asked for check. Btw we missed our show . Next morning I reported it to front desk and said a food and beverage manager would contact us.  I am home a week later and still nada. Sorry guys. I was do disapointed.
5 Gem of the Riviera for sure! Stopped in for happy hour.  Pinot Grigio is not on the menu but they still served it to me at 5$ a glass.  I had to take my fries to go eventually - you can really taste the truffle oil - great size portions can't complain at all!!! I suggest the parmesan truffle fries or caprese skewers! I had a great bartender too left a 3$ tip on a 10$ bill!!! :)
4 I came here with my fiancé while on vacation and I really liked this place.  Food is a bit expensive but I think it is worth it.  It's one of the better places I went to while in Vegas.  I loved the dark atmosphere, it was very calm and romantic.
4 I ate here two nights in a row while at a conference. Once at the bar and once in restaurant. Both waiters I had were fun and attentive. I had steak both nights and both were prepared well. Generous cuts.  Bake potatoes were Ok but not great. Salad was good. I had a gin martini one night and it was great. I also had a Justin Cabernet that was reasonably price. Considering it's in a Strip hotel I thought the meal was reasonably priced, but not cheap.
4 Great steakhouse - food is on par with Capital Grille, Del Frisco's....  Maybe 1/2 star below other steakhouses in terms of "masculine steakhouse decor", but the food and service were excellent.  I had a NY strip and my associate had the rib eye. Both were great.  My cell phone lost power, so the hostess offered to charge it during the meal. Talk about willing to go the extra mile to assist a customer.  Pricing is slightly lower than other steakhouses, but it's still not inexpensive. However, the wine list offered some very good deals if you know what to look for.
3 This is my honest thoughts of the place Pros: food is amazing!! Steak was cooked perfectly! Mac and cheese was good.  All our sides were awesome.   - I know this sounds weird but I loved the way the water waiter poured the water - very classy.  Our waiter was a nice guy and really worked hard for us - they DID charge my iphone - which was HUGE. Being in Vegas on an empty phone sucks  Negatives 1. This place would do so much better in another hotel.  Rivera is ghetto!! For 30-40/steak, I'm paying for food and ambiance - ambiance is not upscale 2. No drink menu...waiter said this is an open bar but I when I come to a nice steak place, I want to see if the bar tender can make me something new.  Margarita was just mix and ice and topped off with rum.  Not good at all.  This place doesn't have the classy big cubes of ice 3. I made a reservation using yelp/open table two hrs before.  When I got there (on time) my table was not ready...it took 12 minutes to get ready and this place was empty!!  Then my table was right in front ....like right when you enter the restaurant - my table was there.  I asked to be in the back where we can have an intimate group dinner but she said those tables were taken (no one sat there when we got there and no one was there when we left) 4.  If a small group orders food, it's not too hard to remember who ordered what.    Overall - would pay more if this place was in a different hotel - great food - just a few things that need tweeking
5 So delish! We had the 20 oz ribeye only which was perfection, crab cakes were delish as well as the shrimp cocktail. Service was excellent very attentive staff. For dessert we had the caramel apple cheesecake and "the Swan" which was a cream puff with ice cream and chocolate shavings. The best part was the cream puff was the shape of a swan. It was wonderful. I would definitely recommend this place for dinner. Plus they have a happy hour with $5 appetizers check it out!!
1 We waited 1 hour an still didn't get our food. The other tables around us received their plates an finished. We had to ask why we didn't get served the manager said it was because of there new menu. What a stupid reply!!
4 I had an excellent experience here.  My rating would more accurately be a 41/2 stars.  Food was very good, not the most outstanding steak house food I have ever had, but as good if not better than most and a bit less expensive than most high-end steak houses.  What really stands out is the service which was superb at our visit.  I also really like the atmosphere of this place.  It is attractive inside and has probably the most comfortable seating of any restaurant I have eaten in for years.  It is also quiet and a great place to go if you want to have a pleasant conversation with your dining companion(s).  So, 4 stars for food and 5 stars for ambience.  I'll definitely go back my next trip to Vegas.
4 = 4.5 STARS STEAKHOUSE IN LAS VEGAS =  When my friend invited me to dinner at the Rivera, I thought that it was another Las Vegas $2.99 Steak & Eggs Adventures that my friends absolutely love.  Who would know that they would actually take me to a fancy steakhouse.  R STEAK & SEAFOOD is definitely a gem hidden within Rivera!   COST:  $30-$50 (Depending on what you order)  I had scallops as appetizer, filet mignon (cooked to perfection), and the "SWAN" for dessert.  Portions are huge and you can definitely share the dessert with 2 or 3 other people.
3 We found this place by accident. I wanted to try to restaurant in Circus Circus but they had a two hour wait. I know there was a steakhouse in the Riviera, so we walked across the street to check it out.   My boyfriend can be a steak snob, and I thought he would hate this place. He actually enjoyed it. It's not the best steak I've had, but it wasn't terrible either.   Prices were reasonable, no complaints here.   The furniture was a little dated, but I wasn't expecting it to be the Ritz.
5 This is a happy hour review.  Hubby and I got there around 5PM.  We were directed to the bar that was off to the side.  It was pretty bright in there compared to the restaurant and when we looked at the drink menu, we almost got spooked from the generic listing....red wine 5$......white wine 5$......you get my drift. Our waiter, Bobby, was kind enough to let us know that they had something other than just Merlot and Chardonnay,  so we both ordered a Pinot Noir.  Wine pour was extremely generous.   We then ordered some food.  Hub went for the regular sliders and I went for the short rib sliders with horseradish sauce.  We also ordered the Parmesan fries.  All of these were listed at 7,8 and 5 dollars in that order. Hub so loved the sliders for they were charbroiled and delicious.  He was kind enough to give me a bite. My sliders were incredible...I am still thinking about them.  Short rib meat with horseradish sauce and pickled fennel....I was in HEAVEN! The fries were ok and pretty standard.   We saw some Mac and cheese come out to another table and that looks pretty spectacular. Service was awesome and we love Bobby who was just a joy!  Will definitely return, and Soon!
5 My husband and I went here for our special anniversary dinner. I had seen the mixed reviews on yelp so we didn't know what to expect. Since we were staying at The Riviera we received a coupon and decided to give it try since we didn't have I go anywhere except downstairs from our room.  We made a reservation on yelp and was able to get seated right away even though we were early. The place was not packed so the hostess actually let us pick our own table. That was cool. Right away, we were served water, a bread basket, and a drinks ordered. Our waiter was Robert, very nice man and a tentative server (He kind of reminded me of Al from 'Quantum Leap' lol) I ordered the braised short ribs and my husband ordered the New York steak. My husband actually said it was one of the best steaks he's had in a very long time!! My short ribs were juicy and tender, I didn't even need a knife. I was eye-balling that creme brûlée but we never got to dessert because dinner alone was enough and then some. Service and food were both very good. Prices are a bit pricey but it was a special occasion so why not? I'd definitely recommend this place. Thank you R Steak & Seafood.
5 This place is excellent! I had the filet with a salad and baked potato. My boyfriend had the rib eye. We both loved our meals. Customer service was excellent and there was no wait. I'd highly recommend this place and even better they had a groupon pay $50 and get $100 worth of food for 2 people.
4 A 4 star restaurant in a 2nd or 3rd rate hotel. Don't be put off by the Riviera's "ambiance". Inside the R steak and seafood restaurant...you are in another world. Its a nice place. hostess was extremely friendly  as was our waiter..bobby. really made you feel as home. Bobby is old school in a very positive way! Its a quiet,relaxing place and the food is quite good. drinks were potent and made correctly. all four of us had a different entrée.......filet..rib eye..NY strip and the salmon and all gave our meals a thumbs up. delicious. we shared a warm peach cobbler for dessert. prices are on the high side but it seems Ok for the food you get. Pleasant vegas dining experience.
