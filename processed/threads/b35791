4 I have only tried the italian beef. Outstanding I plan on going back!
4 The bun was correct, the toppings were correct, and the flavor was there.  Great Chicago dog.  Plus, they sell Viena products!
3 Both my parents are from South side Chicago, and my dad never passes up a chance to partake in a Chicago Dog!  The place itself is small, but clean.  We were literally the only people in there for lunch on a Friday afternoon!  Inside, the walls are decorated with different types of Chicago sports memorabilia, just like any other Chicago Dog joint you will probably come across.  We all ordered the standard Chicago dog.  It was good, not the greatest, but good.  The menu is pretty vast, different types of sausage sandwiches and other fare, and i will admit, i am curious to try other items, but they all were a little pricey for a sandwich!  The owner also sells Vienna Beef peppers and Jays chip at the counter!  It was ok, nothing i would go out of my way for, but worth a try!
1 This place is terrible. You can't even bite through the skin with your teeth.
