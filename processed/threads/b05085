3 Stopped by for breakfast with my Son before we went to work at Three Square Food Bank, which is around the corner.  We enjoyed a Big Cheeseburger and a Sausage Biscuit Sandwich.  The service was fast and accurate.  The food was delicious and fresh.  Will I return?  When we work at Three Square, I'm sure we will.
3 It's fast food.... Need I say more? Points for serving breakfast all day.   I only go for $1 large diet cokes.
4 It's Jack in the Box, so expect Jack in the Box.  Never had them mess up my order and I've been several times. Not stingy with sauces, which is good. never had stale fries or cold burgers or anything. Drive-thru is always good paced,. No complaints; which is about as good a complement you can get from a chain fast food joint.
5 Went for breakfast today, ordered the Supreme Croissant sandwich with hashbrowns. Food was great, Customer service was excellent. I will definitely be returning.
4 The service here was very good.  I went with my son and wife prior to the air show at Nellis.  Breakfast sandwiches were deliciuos, the best of any fast food breakfast.  My son now says that JITB is better than Mcdonalds because of this visit.  He's 5 and likes this place better than Mcdonalds, that is crazy coming from a child.
3 I was so thrilled to have found a Jack in the Box while visiting Vegas. Way out the entire Strip region but, I found it. Missed them greatly ever since I moved out of Dallas where they abound. Very nice staff and your typical food that is expected from here. Watching The Air Force conduct their exercises with the jets by the mountains was unforgettable.
