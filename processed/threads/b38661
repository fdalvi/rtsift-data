5 Love this place.  Tired of paying ridiculous prices for bread.  Even pick up donuts for the dogs.
5 This is the only place where I buy bread. Forget the grocery store and its high price on bread!  I've never had a problem with buying bread here.  Awesome prices and super friendly employees.  They give you a free loaf of bread with a seven dollar purchase. They also have a punchcard program. Wednesdays are double punch day!  Redeem you card for free items when you fill a card. The bread keeps well in the freezer so stock up!  Bagels,  English muffins,  loaf bread and more!  Several name brands to choose from - Sara Lee, Oroweat, Entemman sweets, Bob' Red Mill, etc.
5 Pregnancy craving!  Pre pregnancy, we were eating pretty much eating unprocessed foods at home including breads.  Now I am in at least every other week to pickup Eureka's organic breads.  Tip:  If there is the monthly flier, they have a 20% off coupon for 1 item.. great to use on the Bob Mill's selection.. ie. almond flour for $8/bag is better than Whole Foods $11.99/bag.
