5 Peak Mart is a convenience store. Not your ordinary convenience store mind you. This establishment doesn't smell like moldy cigarette smoke and old hot dogs  like the 7-11 across the street. It's clean, well stocked and did I mention clean? Yes, it's clean. The employees are NICE. Yes, folks, I said nice. And they also don't smell like moldy cigarette smoke and old hot dogs, like the 7-11 does across the street.  These guys sell bulk propane and propane accessories (King of the HIll anyone?), prices are good, good on beer, good on soda, good on just about everything. The coffee is fresh too. Add to that a car wash (hand dry) and better gas prices then the 7-11 across the street.  This place is never an inconvenience to stop by, in fact it's quite the opposite.
1 I purchased a six pack of beer from this convenience store/gas station. After returning home and drinking a couple beers I looked at the expiration date on them because the beers tasted a bit funny.  That's when I realized that the beers had expired almost 2 months ago.   I would never go back to this place ever again.  Having beers on the shelf that is that expired is an embarrassment and a complete disgrace.
5 This store is always clean and has the best coffee around from the Santa Barbara roasting company at very inexpensive prices to boot. I would always go there for my coffee - the employees are very nice as well. The car wash next door is awesome too!! Can't go wrong there and get your gas while you are there as well - can't beat the prices  :)
4 fuel and wash  Grabbed a car wash with my fuel up. Besides the unorganized wait behind a car with a full-service wash.... The guys did an excellent job with my 4.99 wash!
4 Besides the wait at the wash, always satisfied on how clean they get the car.
