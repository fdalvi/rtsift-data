1 Worst Subway I've ever been to! I do not feel like I got my money's worth for what little there was.  Meatball Marinara is a waste of money here. At other locations, they seem larger, meatier. Here, small, dry, burned even! Literally charred. I couldn't believe it! I'm used to a sandwich bursting with meat and sauce and flavour, and here I find myself served by lazy assemblers scuffing their feet to the front, lazily scooping OLD DRIED OUT MEATBALL MARINARA! Honestly, if you can't do your job, then quit and let some else who can!
3 Hit or miss here. One of the girls that works in the morning is fantastic. If it were just for her this place would get 5 stars, however, the other morning girl is TERRIBLE. Rude, stingy on all toppings on your sandwich (uses half of what every other Subway uses on the same sandwich yet still charges full price). When my office was in this area I would order the same thing with both and the price was about $2 different between the two. I no longer work on this side of town so I am happy that my start to the morning is no longer a gamble.
3 Not sure what expectations people have with these chain establishments like Subway; however, I don't find a great difference between this location and others enough to count for much. The staff is great here and the sandwiches are just like any subway sandwich that I have ever had across this country.
