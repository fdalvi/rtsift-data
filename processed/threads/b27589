3 Describing itself as a 'traditional scottish pub', the Wayside is everything you would expect from a community public house.  Having been recently overhauled and redecorated, the Wayside is a place for relaxing with a drink - soft seats, booths and cozy leathers, this pub is certainly traditional. Newspapers and sports on television are available, along with a large selection of malt whiskeys. Staff are friendly, if a bit clumsy (I had my pint spilt by the barmaid), and the atmoshpere is laid back. The Wayside does however, have a darker side - Karaoke nights are a big draw and shatter the relaxed local pub illusion, turning into a loud and out of tune set of speakers instead.  The Wayside is a nice place for a quiet drink on an evening, if you can avoid the karaoke nights.
3 The Wayside is a lovely little place just as Jonathan said, with friendly staff and cosy feel to it...until Karaoke Night.  Last year, i made the stupid decision to go up and sing Super Trooper to a bar full of the most hardcore Karaoke singers known to man. My friends laughed, the patrons did not. As we walked back to the table, one of the locals recommended that if we wanted to keep our lives, we should leave right now.
