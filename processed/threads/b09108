4 Headed here yesterday in search of a food mill.  Although they didn't have one, they were super helpful in suggesting places that might.  The place is orderly, clean and the staff was very friendly.
5 ACE is awesome, they have everything I need for small projects around the house... And I ran into Dennis Farina at this one....
5 Yesterday I had a pump go out in a small pond I have in my back yard.  The owner of the house I lease replaced it about 6 months ago and on a whim I took it in to see if it was still under warranty.  The people were friendly and very helpful and gladly swapped it out without the usual guilt from other hardware stores.  I have always been a Home Depot guy but this experience has made me change my mind.
5 Love this place.  Easy to find whatever you need for the quick pick up and go.  Nice people.
3 Ace is always more expensive than other places, but the folks there sure are helpful and know what they are talking about.
