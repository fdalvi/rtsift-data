5 they always greet every customer here
1 Horrible Pharmacy! Expect to be waiting at least 30min to wait for an auto re fill prescription. Costumer service is non existent. I am going to avoid this location from now on.
4 Thankfully, all CVS Pharmacy stores are the same.  It makes it easy to shop and find what you're looking for.  This place was no different.  When I developed a cold during this past Winter, I dropped by this place to grab some cough drops.  The cold/flu section was easy to find and checkout was a zip.  Friendly employees here too.  Return Factor - 70%
