3 Small bar but cozy. All high top tables and TV screens available but not everywhere in your face.  I had a pretty phenomenal burger and my significant others fish fry wasn't bad. You wouldn't have to twist my arm to get me back here.   (I got the black and blue burger with fried onions. Very tasty and the bun was perfect. I'm big on good bread with my burgers and this was fabulous.)
4 Game Time has one of the best burgers in the Madison area. Seriously - we've tried just about them all. Flavorful meat, never dried out, toasted bun, great sautéed mushrooms and grilled onions as add-ons. They also have a great gyro pita sandwich with onions and their house made tzatziki sauce. They heat the meat on the grill and it's a great sandwich.   My favorite is their French dip. It's not on the regular menu but is a special a couple of times a week. It comes with onions, mushrooms, and Swiss, and since they sauté it all on the grill, it's almost like a cross between a cheesesteak and a French dip. But it's the best one I've had in madison.   To top it off, the fries are fantastic. The servers/bartenders are friendly and efficient, and although it's clearly a tavern, and not high end dining, it's a great inexpensive meal and well worth the drive out past Middleton.
5 Great service, all the bartenders are very friendly. Nice beer selection. Amazing Friday night fish fry. Love their black &  blue burger. A local business managed by local people.
3 Really good burgers. Fun bloody mary bar. If you like to ride bikes to a bar that's out in the country, but not too far out, this is a great choice. Also good for autumn rides out to watch a Packer game.
