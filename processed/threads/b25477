4 This location in Mesa Riverview is one of the smaller ones that I've been in before to get my hair cut.  That said, I have gotten the most consistent haircut from all of the stylists (4 to date).    For me that is something to be said since I enjoy having some stability in how my hair is going to look every 3-4 weeks.  I like wearing a baseball hat but not because I'm embarrassed to have my hair be seen.  With the ability to check in online or via their mobile app, there is no longer any waiting in the cramped waiting area; of which there are only 8 seats I believe.  With the checking in option, I can wait at home or run other errands before showing up and getting my hair cut as soon as I walk in.
5 Lori made me feel comfortable even though I was getting all my hair hacked off. I was sick of my super long hair and even though I couldn't really describe the cut I wanted (short hair newbie), she asked some questions and got an idea of what I wanted and from there was able to achieve a new, exciting look for me. I went in first thing in the morning and the place was dead. I've been cramped in the waiting room when it was busy before and still, they are great at getting you finished. Never needed an appointment.
1 Absolutely go here if you want to be belittled and embarrassed. The male employee that we had the unfortunate luck of speaking with was so rude. We walked in to check in and he was already in a bad mood.   He spoke down to us the whole time. He looked up our number and had an attitude about asking our names. He made us feel embarrassed to even be in the place. There were a couple of other customers waiting, who I hope walked out as we did.   We ended up going somewhere else and were treated much better and got cheaper haircuts that we love. I hope this location takes a closer look at the attitudes of their employees and decides to revamp their employment options.
