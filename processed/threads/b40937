5 Dave is an excellent Realtor and I have known him as an agent for over 10 years. He works well with sellers and buyers and has held deals together that would have fallen apart with most other agents. Excellent choice of Realtors in Mesa, Chandler, Gilbert and Phoenix.
5 We bought a house in April 2011 and Dave was our Realtor. He did an excellent job. He was patient and made sure we got exactly what we were looking for. He was honest with us about the houses we looked at. He did not try to just sell us a house; he made sure we were getting the best value & a home we could spend our lives in. He was in constant communication with our lender so he was up to date on our searches so we could close on our home as soon as possible. Highly recommend Dave to anyone looking to buy a home in the Phoenix and surrounding areas!!
5 Dave is a wonderful Realtor. We have sold a home with Dave and also purchased a home with him. Dave always made us feel like we were a part of his family. Buying or selling a home can be very stressful at times, but Dave made our selling and buying experience with him relaxing and stress-free as best he possibly could. He really cares about his clients. Thank you Dave for all you did for us, you were great!
