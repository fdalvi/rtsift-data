3 Elegant and decent selection, but in my opinion a bit overpriced for what you get in terms of furniture.  Would not hesitate to shop here for accessories, accents, artwork, or lighting fixtures but would probably look elsewhere for seating options.
5 Great and unique selection!  Amazing design team.
5 Ordered several items from them. There were ups and downs but the owner and the manager Steve really try to make it work out for you. Steve has always been great at following up as well.
