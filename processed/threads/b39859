2 I fancy myself a burger connoisseur and was so looking forward to chowing down on  a mouth- watering burger from the burger bar.  i studied and reviewed the menu online several times and decided i was going for the most expensive beef in the world! well i'm sad to report to you...my yelpers...  the $17.95 kobe beef burger did not live up to it's menu description and burger lovers standards.  it was a little overcooked for medium...it was suppose to be pink all the way through according to my server... it was dry and not very flavorful, so i had to load it down with condiments like a kid for moisture and taste. the skinny fries were good (with the truffle mayo..yumm)...but not exceptional. oh and the sesame seed bun was bigger than the kobe beef... that was one expensive bun! viva las vegas!  p.s. I'm southern and finding good ice tea (even with vodka added) in vegas is a gamble. good luck!
2 Pretty pedestrian.  Ordered chicken wings as an appetizer.  I actually think they were sparrow wings they were so small
4 I was very suprised to see low reviews for this place. We Really liked the burger bar. I got the Hangover burger and my girlfriend built her own. We both love a good burger and we were both more than pleased. Great selection of different meats (kobe, grass fed beef, Buffalo and others). Great fries and dipping sauces as well.  Also, check out the selection of alcoholic and non - alcoholic milkshakes and a "dessert burger"
