3 so there's a mediterranean take-out place attached to the philly cheese steaks.  it's the same counter to order.  to me that's a strange combination, but not any worse that the Chinese food / donut shops.    i ordered a combination mediterranean plate: with pita, hummus, falafel, and tabbouleh for $11.  for mall foodcourt food, it was pretty decent.   the food came pretty quickly since there wasn't much of a line and everything was freshly made (not sitting out getting wilty and soggy).  the meal was light and refreshing and i didn't feel gross afterwards like if i had just a burger and fries.    i'd come here to eat again if i was shopping at the outlet mall.
4 Rocky's is actually a Mediterranean and Cheesesteak vendor. Check out the Mediterranean menu for healthy veg and non-veg items!
1 Not really sure what I expected from mall food, but it had been a long time since I had a cheese steak, and I was starving.  This was awful.
1 Ugh. Where do I start to complain?  The good: service was friendly.  The bad: everything else.  I ordered a #2 combo. 'Upgraded' to a large drink, which made it $12.95! Really?! Whatever. It's a mall food court, and I just spent $5 at Subway for a 6" sub(not a footlong) for my son. What I got was the feeling that I was ripped off. A steak-um on a stale hot dog bun, with some cheese wiz, and a handful of fries. On top of that, they only had generic ketchup for the fries. Hunt's is bad enough, but generic? C'mon man!! Luckily a neighboring  place had some Heinz that they gave me. Didn't matter though. Nothing could have helped this so-called food. STAY AWAY!!
