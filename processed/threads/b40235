5 I've been coming to this gym for almost 3 years.  Changed from LA Boxing to UFC Gym. Punching and kicking a bag is not only a great workout but also a great way to release stress.  I love the 6AM class, the perfect way to start my day.  The trainers are great! Thank you Erick, Andrea and Danny. TRX training begins next week.
5 Love this gym! Danny & Eric are awesome for kickboxing classes. Use lots of muscles I never knew I had. Toned, healthier and happier! Thanks UFC Gym. Def there at least 3x week plus cab always use gym facilities.
5 I love this place.  Even if you're an overweight, out-of-shape, never-boxed-before schlub like me, you can find a class you will enjoy.  Some trainers are better than others for total newbies (seek out Ryan's and Dylan's boxing/kickboxing classes--they're great for beginners), but all of them are fun.  Basically, with this kind of workout, you just push yourself to your limit, and each person is different.  Even if you get gassed and leave early, you'll feel a sense of accomplishment, and your classmates don't look askance.  The gym facilities are clean and simple: some weights, a couple of machines, but mostly just boxing bags.  That's all you need anyway.  Take a free class: you'll be glad you did.
