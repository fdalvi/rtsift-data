3 This is tucked away in a non descript strip mall and is nothing to look at. Don't bother if ambiance is what you are after. If, though, you just want a decent gyro, then check the joint out. It seemed as though they weren't selling a lot a gyros based on the slight crispiness on the edges of the meat, but it is tasty, plenty of tatziki sauce and crispy fires. All at a very reasonable price. I will stop by again when we are in the area.
5 They have excellent gyros. I've been there several times in the past year for lunch and the food and service has always been very good. Looks like a local favorite. Prices are a bargain.   Looking forward to trying other menu items instead of the gyros which are a sure thing for me. They have a small bar which customers where enjoying each time I was there. A freindly place for a quick tasty meal. The decor is almost nonexistent but the food is good. It has an outdoor seating area for the cooler weather months.
