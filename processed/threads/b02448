5 Was referred to this location for an MRI (was having foot pain). My appointment time was at 8am and they told me to arrive 30 minutes early to fill out paperwork, so I did. Upon arrival, they gave me a one-page health survey to fill out, which I did and within 10 minutes they had called me back to the testing area.   They had me put my purse into a locked locker (of which I held the key for), and took me into the MRI suite. They had me lay down on the table, and even gave me a blanket as it was a little chilly in the room. The MRI took about 15 minutes to complete and I was out of the office by 8:05am (just 5 minutes after my scheduled appointment time). Perfect.   The employees were fabulous and I have zero complaints. Hope I dont have to go back for more testing, but if I do, I'll gladly go to this location.
3 Didn't have the order for my test when I arrived. They say they didn't get it, dr's office said they sent it??? Who knows? Average service and wait times.
4 Probably the quickest I've ever been in and out for an x-ray, ever. Staff was nice and the small wait was nice and cool with plenty of Today Show on TV.
