2 I'm not too proud to admit that I've frequented Lloyd's Weatherspoons bar at the Omni Centre on more than one occasion.  In fact, it is our usual spot to meet at the start of a night out in town to get the cheap drinks in before heading into town and paying double or more.    OK, I'm not going to lie to you - avoid the food at all costs because it used to be barely edible until it became completely inedible.  It may be cheap but it ain't worth it.  Keep your money for McDonalds or a fish supper later on in the night.    I'd avoid this bar on Friday and Saturdays as it is rammed pack with people getting the cheap drinks in.  You don't need to watch Eastenders though, save money on your TV license and just go here as you're sure to get entertained by the clientele!!!    If it is shots you're after then head here for half an hour before going on somewhere more classy which lets face it wouldn't be hard to find!!!    Leave your designer gear at home, down your trackies, sit back and be entertained by the other customers:)  Always a laugh and you're guaranteed to leave with a few stories!!!
