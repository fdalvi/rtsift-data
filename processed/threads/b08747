4 Just finished a year lease here.  I know it's really popular to bag on every apartment complex on Yelp, but this place is solid.  Pros:  The office staff is excellent, which I can very rarely say - Dan and Robin do an awesome job, have maintenance out immediately after you request it, and will help out it dire circumstances.   I once gave a friend coming into town the wrong key when he dropped by my job across town to pick it up, I called the office and asked them to let them in and they walked down and opened my apartment for my friends (after verifying my identity via email).  The community is quiet.  Prices are very reasonable.   The cons:  The apartments were built in the 80's, and look like they were built in the 80's, but have been maintained well.  You get what you pay for, neither super cheap nor luxury.
5 I love living here! It is quiet and the staff is amazing. Anytime I've needed anything, they've taken care of it on the same day. There has been no turnover and it's been great working with the same people consistently since I've lived there. They always go above and beyond; in fact, when I needed a jump for my car, a staff member was right there and ready to help. I would recommend this complex to anyone!
2 I never write reviews but I lived here for almost 5 years ever since I left my home state in Wisconsin! My apartment had multiple leaks through it in the years and the parking lot floods BADLY every time it rains hard!!!!! The parking got so bad with water that it flooded INSIDE my car which the complex dismissed!! Then when I moved out I cleaned the apartment from top to bottom (except the tub that for whatever reason wouldn't get clean) and they charged me up the ass!!!!! The apartments are nice but they are VERY overpriced!!!!
