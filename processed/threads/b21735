4 I've only recently discovered AJ's Fine Foods which I understand is owned by Basha's.  In my book, that's another reason to shop there.  Arizona owned and operated, keep it local.  I was pleasantly surprised when I entered the store.  The atmosphere was very warm and I found all the employees I encountered to be of pleasant disposition.  Contrast that with, oh...Safeway where I recently had a conversation with a clerk about how rotten they felt the company was.  I had stopped there for lunch and they had a decent selection of prepared foods and pastries as well as coffee and espresso drinks.    They also had an olive bar and other higher end "salad bar" type prepared foods.  I discovered that they carry the greatest chocolate in the world...Scharfen Berger.  If I can find it at all it is usually somewhere like World Market where they have one variety.  Here they carry about 8 varieties of this divine stuff.  That alone will bring me back.  Overall they're prices were as expected...higher than a regular grocery.  But they carried higher end and gourmet foods and had a much nicer atmosphere, so I guess they fall in to the category: "You get what you pay for."
4 This is a nice gourmet store with a huge variety of items, every time I'm in AZ I stop by to purchase some goodies like Prosciutto, Cheeses, Steaks, Chicken Wings w/this delicious bleu cheese they make, sandwiches, and of course  dessert's from there bakery the list goes on and on, very yummy items......
