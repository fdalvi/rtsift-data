5 Cool place
4 I had no problem with customer service as Jesse P. has mentioned. The workers were actually very nice & friendly to me. They have everything from feed to clothing. I thought the clothing, while appearing to be of good quality, was a bit pricey. They even have chicks for sale at $2.99 each. They are very cute, but make sure you use the hand sanitizer provided after if you pet them! I will shop here again!
5 Cool store love the variety....baby ducks, chainsaws and super cute jeans! will be going back asap :)
5 Their staff is always helpful and friendly.  Great prices on western and workwear.  Had adequate supplies of ammo this summer where other places were cleaned out.
5 Great country store. You can get your jeans and ammo here. Brent & Wayne will take great care of you over at the gun counter.
