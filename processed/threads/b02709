4 Did you know they have Happy Hour? Quick stop for a cool treat!  On weekdays from 2pm-4pm, they have happy hour on a few of their refreshing drinks! So cool!! 1/2 OFF!! Moolatte, Arctic Rush, Shakes, and Malts!! Woot woot!! It's essential in this heat!! :)
1 This place needs a major renovation, and the wait staff aren't geared toward customer service. If they don't do your order right, they refuse to make it right. Skip this place. Next time, stop at the DQ near I-10 and Florence.
5 Hey it's Dairy Queen, what more is there to say? it's always clean
4 Actually this review is for the other Dairy Queen on Florence near Interstate 10 because I didn't find it on Yelp. I give them 0 stars. I went in and ordered a chili cheese dog. Hot dog appeared poor quality. There was no one at the counter and no customers which is always a bad sign but I was really hungry so I waited. Went to the restroom which was filthy and stunk to high heaven.
4 Cheeseburger and chocolate cone - can't go wrong. Reminds me of childhood.
