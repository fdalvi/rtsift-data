4 2010 Opening day of Rehab and to avoid the chaos and cuz he can, we get to party in a cabana at Skybar.  Peaceful without the Rehab mess...no bumpin elbows or pushing ur way to get around.  Just like a secluded personal party at the biggest party that day.  Hostess was pleasant, made sure she made drinks for everyone, and our food orders came out quick.  Beautiful day, Dj spinning hot beats, gorgeous people, infinity wading pool, and the real lounge spot upstairs.  Security is tight but friendly.  Not sure why you would want to go elsewhere from here but if you do (like someone begging you to check out the rest of the pool scenes), make sure not to wonder towards the HRH Beach club cause once you do, you'll have to go ALL the way around...through the casino, and Rehab to get back to Skybar.  Not that I didn't love the experience of walking through the casino in my bikini and heels but wasn't what I had on my list of things I had to do that day.  Good Times as always!! =P
5 Awesome cuz its a good place to hide from Rehab to catch your breath. Ask for Zoran. He was awesome!
4 I have stayed at the Hard Rock many times over the years and have never made it to the Skybar and I think they closed it some time in late 2010 as I never see people there when I look out my room window.  However, this month, I was there for a private company event for an evening reception and it was really nice.  It has a lounge-y feel and the decor is more modern.  There is even a swimming pool that is lit up and looks really cool once the sun goes down.  During the event, we had all you can drink with a fully stocked bar and service was quick as they had 3 or 4 bartenders working to help about 400 of us. :)  I hope we come back here next year, all you can drink is always fun when someone else picks up the tab!!  It would be nice if this lounge stays open regularly during pool season as it is elevated and gets you away from the crowds if you're looking for some more seclusion and privacy.
