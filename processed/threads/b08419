3 This place is really well hidden.  I would not have even known it was there if I hadn't called  PCA SKIN to find out which salons carry their product.  This location was at the top of the list I was given and happened to be close to my area.  I really was surprised as I walked in, it was really nice inside. The girl at the counter was very helpful and told me they could order in any of the PCA products I needed and just let her know when I was getting low and they would place the order for me. COOL!  I'll be returning to get my PCA skin care from now on, and who knows maybe I'll even try out some of their services.  I'm only giving 3 stars since I have not had any treatments here, but they do deserve at least 3 for great customer service.
5 Mary Johnson is the skin guru. Hands down the most educated, gentle, caring, skin professional to walk the earth. I was plagued by adult acne late last year. Not only was it embarrassing but it was painful and depressing. Mary did not help me she fixed me. If I could I would have Mary in my pocket at all times. She is an acne exterminator for all ages. I highly recommend Paraiso Skin Care to everyone!
