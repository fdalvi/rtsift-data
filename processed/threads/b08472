2 I have a fairly decent 4 door sedan. I love my baby, I take care of it and it takes care of me. I make sure it has it's regular oil-changes, tune-ups and anything else that comes along.   How is it that every single time I go to Jiffy Lube for an oil change it costs me somewhere between $150-$250? I always get the $60-$80 range for high octane oil changes so it can last atleast 5K miles.  Really? Is it because I look naive and I'm a girl? I'm seriously questioning it because it always seem like they happen to find 'something' wrong. And being the person who just trusts them, I've been paying them this ridiculous amount for ages. It's always something. 'You need new wipers', 'your filter needs to be changed out' (has a few leaves on it, can easily be removed, not even gray-ed out filter), 'your coolant is low',  etc. etc. Strange thing is when I left the shop that day,  the receipt said they vacummed my floors. Uh...how is that possible when everything that I left on the floor exactly in the same spot? Nothing looked vaccumed.  I got fed up with these prices and talked to my husband. He threw a fit. He said that I was getting ripped off so badly, and to not go there again. I think it's time to find a different place to change my oil. Better yet, I'll have the hubs teach me.
1 Slow........service. They just can't get it going. Avoid this place unless you have a couple hours to kill watching TV on a 13" screen.
