2 Here's a disclaimer: I usually just use the automated wash here since it's good, cheap and I only stay for the minimum time possible.  But it's around the corner from my house so it's become the default place to go.  Prices: It's a typical wash your own car wash in Phoenix. Uses quarters.  Safety: Not really. This is one of the few places in America that I wish I had a concealed weapons permit and I was packing heat.  A couple of years ago  I arrived 30 seconds after an armed car jacking.  Since then I've been more aware of my surrounding and become more wary of some of the other clientelle.  Lots of angry men who are head over heels in love with their below average, but shiny-wheeled cars.  Overall: Use the automated car wash they've installed in the north bay. It's good value. But don't stay longer than necessary.
3 I have only used the auto-drive-thru wash. The blowers at the end are my favorite...I feel like I'm going through a tornado! Hahah. But for realsies...it does it's job. Once, my boss went, and the owner just happened to be there. He presold a bunch of washes. I think they were buy 3 get 1 free. Decent deal for a cheapie car wash!
5 I have been a customer of this car wash for years. This is the only self serve that the owner is often on site. He is very helpful and nice. The car wash is clean and the foam brush always puts out tons of foam. I have not used the automatic to clean my car but I have used the dryer only option after I washed my car in the bay. It is a great deal at only a $1.00! Recommend.
