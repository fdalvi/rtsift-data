5 I take all of my shoe repair and clothing mending to these guys. They never disappoint!
5 Good stuff! They fixed my shoes within 24 hrs and came out looking like new for $15
5 Great place. I took a pair of sandals in for a minor repair and he didn't charge me. Great customer service and I will go back.
1 I took a pair of shoes to this place.  It was a simple repair, they just needed the straps glued back in.  I was shocked when I went in and there were display cases of watches and only old shoes in sight.  It looked like a fence for something.  I showed him my shoes and he told me the only thing he could do was staple the straps on the outside.  The shoes are Steve Madden Juke and it would have change the entire look.  He informed me that was the look now.  Um no, I'll try somewhere else and left.  I took them to another shop and the owner glued them and fixed them for me for $15.  Would never go back to this place, not even if I were shopping for a watch.
