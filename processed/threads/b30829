5 My three kids and I stayed here for three nights and had a good experience.  The room was pretty big and very comfortable.  The gym had a lot more equipment than most hotels and was undergoing a rehab to make it even better.  Importantly for the kids, the pool was big, warm, and a lot of fun.  Wifi was free and reasonably fast.  We didn't eat on site, and I didn't have any issues with the parking.  With rush hour traffic, you can get to key tourist sites downtown in 15 minutes.    We picked this over a hotel closer to downtown since it was really affordable ($74US) per night and it had the pool and free parking.  We'd stay there again.
4 I have loves my stay here, room is big, spacious and clean. Good atmosphere at the bar and very warm and comfortable surroundings. Only reason why I haven't given it 5 stars is because I wasn't to impressed with the meal. Chips were well overlooked and the gammon steak was nothing special. I would definatly stay here again I just wouldn't eat here.
3 Great Value for money, large rooms, clean, tidy & well presented. I cannot fault our stay at all. The restaurant however should be avoided. Poor staff service, no fizz in the soft drinks & despite a well presented steak, i could have resoled my shoes with... If the nails were up to it! The gammon steak was also well presented, however, i do believe the salt content was greater than a glass of water from the Dead Sea. In short; when paying a premium price, (Â£4.70 for a Vodka Orange) i expect a premium service. It unfortunately means we will probably & sadly stay at another hotel next time in Edinburgh.
