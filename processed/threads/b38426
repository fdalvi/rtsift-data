5 These guys are very reasonably priced, came out on short notice. Awesome trailer, great service and they made the party extra easy with about 15 kids inside the trailer the whole time I almost forgot we were having a kids party!  I recommend doing this toward the end of the day so that the lights they have for the outisde game can be used for the dance game that the girls loved the most...heck I would rent this for an adult party!
5 Call me lucky ! I have gotten to hang out at the EPIC trailer several times now.  Love to play video games ? Have a party to host?  Try this out for a major fun time. Stasy cool inside the EPIc game trailer.  No matter what your age and interest, the game trailer just screams fun !  The trailer has the the feel of a limo , plush and cushy with comfortable pleather seating , it has all the extras  with several  large game screens  for different groups of gamers in one  trailer.     Outside the trailer is the dance area , you can't go wrong with a disco ball!  The uber large screen on the outside has you immediately ready to shake your groove thing. Groups can dance to all the latest video dance games. Makes me want to have a party just to hire them!
5 Epic Game Trailer was a total hit.  Chris is awesome and I never worried about any detail.  Once he showed up I had 16 kids in the trailer for 2 hours none stop and a group on the outside dancing like there was no tomorrow.  My daughter is 8 and everyone enjoyed the trailer because of all the options.
