2 eH, What's that SMELL?  The Iced Coffee Machine was kicking out some kinda sludge and that SMELL was so awful I couldn't even entertain the thought of standing in line to purchase anything.  I was outta there!!  This wasn't the 1st time either-It seems they mop their floors with the urinal/toilet bowl water. lol:(
3 Having to pay an extra .45 cents just to use a card is not the kind of 'convenience' fee I enjoy. This is a typical Arco AM / PM with a good location at the edge of the Riviera Hotel & across from the Las Vegas Hilton.
3 One of the few gas stations and convenience stores near the Las Vegas Strip, we fill up on gas here before heading back home.  The gas station portion of this place is an ARCO, which means that if you want to pay at the pump, you have to use your debit card.  Credit Cards won't work at the pump.  The lanes are very tight here and it gets very busy at times.  The location is convenient though, so it's worth the hassle.  Return Factor - 80%
