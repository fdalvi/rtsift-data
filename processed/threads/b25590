3 A small shop with a decent selection of fabrics. Prices were about average. Lots of great notions though.
3 I liked this shop. They had some beautiful fabrics I hadn't seen before. The lady working the cutting counter was very sweet and courteous. The owner was there, but he was cold and never said anything to us. But, I would shop here again. Cute shop.
4 Just stopped by the shop again yesterday while in Phoenix for a wedding. I. Love. this. Store. I went looking for a specific Michael Miller line and they were out, but gave me info on when it's coming back in. The staff was super sweet and helpful. There were quite a few people waiting in line at the cutting table and the owner started cutting in the back as well to make it go faster.   They offer cookies, iced tea, coffee, etc for you while you're waiting which makes you feel like you're at someone's home and can relax and shop. Best of both worlds!   The clearance section was fantastic. Usually clearance fabrics are not stylish or interesting look. But I found some great finds, 40% off! woohoo!   Had a great chat with the owner and enjoyed my stop yet again. Thanks dudes! Best place for unique, stylish, modern fabrics as well as the old standards. LOVE!
5 We have not been to a better quilt shop.  Good selection of civil war era reproduction. Husband friendly with a place to sit, restroom for customers. Friendly staff. Great quality but not a huge quantity.   No regional fabric.  We will return.
