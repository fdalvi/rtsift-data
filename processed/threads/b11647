5 Just moved to Las Vegas and needed a place to get my clothes dry cleaned. Tried a few nearby places like Al Philips, Fazio's, and Boston Cleaners, but they were so expensive and didn't really do that great of job. I drove down Charleston to go to KFC when I noticed Polo Cleaners. I got to say that I was first skeptical about Polo because they were so cheap compared to the other places. I figured lower prices mean lower quality, but that is not the case. All my clothes come out great and they provide excellent customer service. For example, a button on one of my shirts fell off one morning and the next time I dropped off and picked up that shirt the missing button was replaced with a new one. I never even asked them to sew one on for me. The lady that works there also does alterations which is a plus for me because I get pants altered all the time. 5 stars all the way for me.
5 What you'd expect from excellent dry cleaning service. Quick, honest, and reliable. Alterations on site as well. Great location for those living in Summerlin area.
2 I was looking for a new dry cleaner so I gave Polo Cleaners a shot based on the positive reviews. I was disappointed by the high prices - $5 to dry clean a man's dress shirt, $7.50 for a blazer and $12.50 for a two piece suit (pants/jacket). The high prices might have been justified for same day service, but it was standard two day service.
5 I am giving this 5-star rating in regards to a phone call with the seamstress. She was polite efficient and friendly. Thank You polo cleaners for your  Friendly phone service!!!
