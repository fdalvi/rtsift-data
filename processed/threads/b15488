1 John Ghiz with Arizona Mobile Pet grooming did a horrible job on my two dogs. He was rather wheezy and tired looking and had my golden and corgi in the van for over two hours and when I called out to him he opened the door and the dogs were only half done. He missed some nails on both dogs, did not clean out their ears, brush them or trim them. He just washed them. Worst and most expensive grooming EVER.
1 The worse. He clipped half my dog. I had to tell him he forgot the other half. When people saw my dog they started to laugh the job was so bad.
4 John is such a terrific groomer!  He clearly loves dogs and had such a gentle and caring way with my labradoodle.  He gave him the perfect teddy bear face and his overall body length was just what I wanted.  Will definitely be calling him again.
1 Pros: John was available short notice  Cons: John called my dogs private parts his "thingey" over and over again  He arrived a day late - and didnt bother calling to tell me - I had to call after waiting for him for 2 hours  My dog looks chopped up... there are variations in razor length all over him so you can actually see the clipper marks, His feet were not trimmed and he looks awful with missing hair in some places and long hair in some places.  The whole grooming process took like 2 hours... and my dog was returned wet.  I will never use this groomer again.
1 terrible and extremely over priced
