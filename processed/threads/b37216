3 This place was an everyday, average restaurant. They only serve breakfast and lunch here, so i dropped in at 2:00pm to grab some lunch.  The outside is unappealing right now. They have not yet put up a sign, and still have the classic "NOW OPEN" sign still dangling right above the door. The inside is extremely clean, open, and has a nice comforting appeal.   We were handed menus by our server without any introduction, and we ordered some drinks. When I ordered my coffee I didn't receive any sort of creamer, maybe they figured I was that sort of manly man who takes his coffee black, but I'm guessing that wasn't the case.   I ordered the "3 Sliders" which were all the topped with goat cheese and sauteed onions. Each patty is 2oz and they were cooked well. I could have done without so much goat cheese. After the first slider having all that heavy cheese, you are almost dreading the next 2. It would have been nice to either get a variety of sliders, or have something added to those sliders to make them more unique and more appetizing.   In the middle of our lunch, I was told they were closed. I guess they closed at 2:30, but online it says 3pm. We were rushed out of the restaurant, maybe it was because of the inexperience of the server, or because we were the only table there. Either way, it wasn't enjoyable to be rushed out of a lunch.   The place is clean, and has an inviting atmosphere, but they definitely need a little bit of work, especially when they are going against places like DW Bistro that is 5 mins away.
3 3 1/2 stars.    5 of us went over for breakfast; we were tempted by a coupon we received in the mail.  Cute place.  Clean and new; about 15 tables.    It was an intimate experience, indeed.  There were only two employees; the server, and the cook, and we were the only guests.    We had an omelette, a waffle, biscuits and gravy, blintzes and a 2 egg breakfast.  The food took a little while since there was only 1 guy cooking it and since it was all made fresh.  Everyone was very pleased with their food.  Absolutely no complaints.  Delicious gravy, eggs cooked perfectly, delightful ingredients in the omelette, etc.  In addition, they have an espresso machine and offer flavored lattes - this pleases me immensely.    The prices were definitely right - all the meals were around $6 - $7.  We got one freebie with our coupon so we wound up with a bill for $37 for 4 coffees, a latte and 4 breakfasts.  Not bad at all!  I would definitely pop back in for a fresh, tasty, and quiet breakfast.
3 Today I gave B 2B a try after a late morning work out.  Surprised they don't have a sign yet given the apparent money spent building out the kitchen  - all new with dominating stainless steel equipment.  the space reminds me of Mr. Mama, Eggs Cafe, norm's cafe, etc.  - relatively small dining room serving breakfast and lunch.  one other table occupied when i walked in around 10:30.  Straight forward menu - prices seem very reasonable.  I opt for the basic 2 egg breakfast with sausage - $5.50 ( pic attached )   since the place is called Biscuits 2 Burgers i figure i should try the biscuit so i ask for one with the meal.   The server asked if i wanted 2, if so, it's $2 more.  I ask,"  does the meal come with toast ?"  answer: you can also get toast with the biscuit.  I simply want a biscuit instead of toast.  "Ok"  Food took a while which surprised me since only one other table.  Even with one cook, how long does it take to warm up some sausage, fry up 2 eggs and potatoes and put a biscuit on a plate ?  Based on what i received, I'm guessing the delay was due to the potatoes - my guess they were cooked up fresh - if busier, they need to cut corners on the food prep - this can occur without sacrificing quality ( and yes, I've worked as a cook and I've owned a bar/grill so i know a few things ...emphasis on few ! )   The food was decent, somewhat unremarkable but i didn't have high expectations except when it came to the biscuit.  I figure a place called biscuit 2 burger will pride itself on their biscuits.  The biscuit was underwhelming - bummer !  Surprised to see a surcharge of .50 on my bill that can only be attributable to the biscuit.  I figure it's unlikely i'm returning to this place so i opted not to debate the surcharge.
3 After discovering that Carlos' Kitchen closed the day before I got there, I scrambled to find somewhere else close by to get a burger recently. I remembered that a workout friend told me about a new place near our gym called Biscuits 2 Burgers so I thought I'd seek it out. They pretty much don't exist online still; no official website, no Yelp page, so I started driving west on Tropicana until I found it. Despite all of this, was my experience encouraging enough to keep this place around?  The restaurant is in a fairly new strip of retail on Tropicana and Grand Canyon, a lot of the spaces are still empty and this whole area is kind of quiet. Biscuits has a temporary (?) vinyl sign above the door that doesn't stand out too much; I can only hope they replace it with something better if they plan on sticking around. The interior is very open and clean with a large number of 2- and 4-top tables, as well as a high counter facing the kitchen area. The tagline on their menu is 'your neighborhood caf√©', and it definitely had that feel during my visit; everyone knew the chefs while I was in there and they were all discussing each other's family members and things.  The menu is pretty small; one small page of breakfast items, and a handful of burgers and sandwiches. In an attempt to order something a bit neutral, I ignored the pastrami-topped burger, Philly burger and Hawaiian burger and went with a California burger with avocado, tomato and cheddar. There's also a note on the menu that 'all sandwiches are served with choice of chips or macaroni salad', but I was given the choice of skinny or fat fries which relieved me a bit. The burger had great quality meat; it was very flavorful and cooked close to medium rare. The bun was grilled and tasty, kind of the off-the-shelf backyard BBQ variety, and a bit too thin for this burger as it split into a few pieces about halfway through. The avocado was good, but do three slices of avocado turn a cheeseburger into a California burger? I guess so. The LTO were all decent, a bit too much lettuce maybe but that's easily remedied.  The fries were of the very generic frozen variety, but they were cooked very much to my liking of done to a bit over done so I was ok with them. Overall this was not bad at all, and certainly way better than Great Links which supposedly won some best burger contest in town. The place is cute; I hope it can have some staying power in a fairly empty retail development with poor signage and no advertising that I know of. It was also a good value for the money; my meal came to a fairly reasonable $9.19 with an iced tea. If you're in the neighborhood definitely come by to support these guys, I don't know if it would make it onto any of my must-have lists, but they get my approval.
5 I stopped in this morning, to find one of the absolute best bowls of homemade oatmeal & lemon poppy seed muffins (short of Mom's) that i've ever had! Joe the owner was very polite and friendly, as was my waiter. I will definitely be stopping back in to try more of Joe's good homemade cooking!
3 First visit on a sunday afternoon the place was almost empty don't know if this was timing or what but either way we were told to sit wherever.  Very cute place in a strip mall and there is  signage on the building but we still drove by it. The wait staff was attentive and got our drink order quickly.  Ordered an ice coffee, too sweet and the server was happy to try again but sadly the sweetness wasnt the problem. The coffee was horrible sorry but it was. I ordered the challah french toast which was good it came with warm syrup. The husband got the Hawaiian burger which was ok but lacked flavor even with the teriyaki sauce and canned pineapple makes me wonder how much of their stuff is fresh and what is being prepped and made fresh and what's coming out of a can or bottle.  The chef did come out and check on things which I thought was nice. Not sure yet if its a place I would recommend maybe another visit will sway me.
4 So far so good. Nice people and the Chef came out and spoke with us and made sure we liked our food. I will be back for Date Night!
5 My husband and I were looking for a late breakfast/early lunch spot and I remembered this opened by our house.   I had their breakfast special, croissant sandwich with egg and bacon accompanied by seasoned potatoes. It was delicious! The croissant was big and toasted perfectly and the potatoes were fresh and seasoned just right, not too salty and not greasy.   My husband got the New York burger which he said was very good. The party was huge and moist and the veggies were very fresh. He got skinny fries with it and those were cooked just right.   Overall, we had a great experience. Our waitress was very nice and kept checking on us-she even offered us some pastries as we waited for our food. The chef/owner came to our table as well to see how everything was, which was very nice of him to do. We will definitely be coming back!   Oh, they do close at 2:30 but have a Friday dinner event from 5-8:30.
5 We went to Biscuits 2 Burgers today around 1:30 and were happily surprised.  Since it was a small restaurant in an inconspicuous area with a simple, vinyl sign, I did not expect too much.  However, I was immediately impressed when we walked in.  The clean, modern decor and fresh flowers on every table created an inviting ambiance that was accentuated even more by the friendly demeanor of our server.  After ordering, we were offered a fresh pastry while we waited for our food.  While we declined, it was still an appreciated gesture.  My boyfriend ordered the California Burger (avocado, tomato and cheddar on an 8 oz angus beef patty) and I ordered the City Sliders (goat cheese and caramelized onions on three 2 oz angus beef patties).  The food was simple, fresh and delicious.  My only criticism would be about the fries.  They were good, but they were obviously from the freezer, so they were nothing special.  We finished off the meal with a complimentary flan (which our server brought out since it was our first time eating there).  Overall a great experience, and we will be back to try the breakfast at some point soon.  The best part?  For an awesome meal with two entrees and one drink, our bill was only 16 and change.  Wow.  Come and try Biscuits 2 Burgers, and hopefully it will stay around for a while.
5 Great food.  Love the biscuit of the day!
5 Biscuits 2 Burgers is a great new breakfast/lunch spot.  They serve breakfast until they close at 3pm, and I like having breakfast for lunch.  They feature a different homemade biscuit everyday and we had cheddar biscuits the day we went.  I had the biscuit sliders with sausage and scrambled eggs and they were delicious.  It comes with a very generous side of hash browns which I couldn't even finish.  Another person at our table had the NY burger and loved it, so I may have to try that next time.  Prices were really reasonable and the service was good.  The owner/chef even came over and spoke with us for a few minutes, which was a nice touch.
5 Went there for late breakfast with some of my girlfriends. I really liked it. The service was very attentive, cappuccino tasted great, freshly squeezed OJ was amazing and food was also on the same high level as everything else. At the end of our meal, the chef stopped by and made sure everything was as we wanted and gave us complimentary little cupcakes that were tasty and adorable looking.  Even though I live in Henderson, I will come back there for sure :)
4 Food was good, friendly & quick service. Prices are very reasonable & the freshly squeezed orange juice was great. Will definitely go back soon.
5 GREAT PLACE! This place deserves good business! They are still new and working out some kinks, but the food and atmosphere are great! The owner/chef came and chatted with us, after giving us 2 coupons for 2 for 1 breakfast. I love that you can see the whole kitchen so you know what's going in your food. Great fresh food!
5 The quality of food you get here is amazing and the price is SUPER cheap. I am talking $6.50 for the BEST BISCUITS AND GRAVY I HAVE EVER HAD! It was all caps worthy, if you haven't been here yet...you need to go!!!!
5 Home made biscuits, enough said! Seriously very good food. great service.  our service was quite attentive. She was great in explaining everything to us. She was delightful.  The food was great. I had a wonderful fluffy omelet. It was cooked perfectly. The potatoes  crispy which is how I prefer them. The biscuit was so fresh and full of flavor and flaky tenderness. My husband love his biscuits and gravy. We also shared a cheese Danish that was so light and moist. The cheese center was chilled which is how it should be.  We are fans and will be back!
5 This place is amazing love it !! The food is always fresh . The staff is friendly worth the money every cent .
5 I just took my kids to this place and it was amazing! The biscuits were so fresh and the burgers were amazing.    Our waitress was Sandy and she was so entertaining.   So if you go on the weekend ask for Sandy an order the biscuits.  You will not be disappointed
4 This place is delicious. Service is great, super clean, relaxed atmosphere. Food is amazing and the prices are unbelievably affordable. Great for families!!!
4 I stopped here for breakfast yesterday morning partway through my Sunday morning bike ride.  I was here just before 8 AM and they weren't yet open.  Promptly at 8, the door opened and I was shown in.  I was told to sit anywhere.  The first thing I noticed was what a nicely decorated restaurant it was.  It was a sushi restaurant that closed which explains the large amount of bar seating and the food prep going on behind the counter.  I ordered the special of the day which was a breakfast croissant with 2 eggs cooked the way you want, two sausages or two slices of bacon--your choice--and your choice of cheese.  It also came with breakfast potatoes they called hash browns.  They're really not hash browns but they were very good potatoes.  Everything was very good.  My coffee was refilled quickly.  Angel, the server, was very pleasant!  I asked her about the Date Nights they're having and she explained and gave me a copy of the menu from their first anniversary Date Night dinner.  Normal date night dinners are $16.95 and you can call to get information about the menu and pricing.    Angel brought a case with pastries--doughnuts, cupcakes, etc--and at first I thought she was offering a complimentary one.  When she told me the price, I then knew they weren't freebies.  It wasn't something I wanted with breakfast and since I was riding my bike, I didn't want to take any along to get damaged as I rode along.  I'll come back here because I do have to try something with a biscuit.
5 Why didnt we come here sooner!? Great decor, clean, friendly, great food. Could use more  kids food choices and kid-friendly cups. We'll be back very soon!
5 So glad we finally tried this place. The food was great! I had the breakfast special-croissant sandwich-and it was so yummy.   Kid-friendly. My daughter loved the fresh OJ.   Staff was super sweet and took great care of us.  Reasonable prices.  We will definitely be back!
5 Another outstanding brunch at this hidden gem. Amazing whole wheat waffle, perfect hash browns and tasty sausage and bacon.  You have to check it out and Chef Joe is super friendly as are the entire staff.  Just listening to Chef Joe's Creature feature  menu for the October 25th date night. I wish we were going to be in Las Vegas that night, if you are, you should call now for reservations. It will be a Spooktacular evening - costumes are encouraged.
2 It was just ok. The wait staff tried extremely hard to please. The food presentation was good but the taste was just alright. Maybe it will get better based on reviews?
2 Sadly I must say the food is not as good as it used to be and service is lacking. Bacon was cool and undercooked, potatoes were dry and over cooked. We had come here before and food was excellent however this time was a completely opposite experience. A note on the service... I spilled a glass of water before we rec'd our food and the entire spilled mess remained on our table for the entire meal!!
2 This is my second visit here. First time food was soo good. Ordered the breakfast biscuits with turkey bacon and all was fully cooked & biscuits were fresh.  This time, ehhh food was ok.  Ordered the cheese omelette with turkey bacon. Omelette was very good but turkey bacon was not cooked all the way, some parts were still cold, breakfast potatoes were old and hard. Then my glass of water spilled accidentally on the table & all we got were paper napkins to clean the water mess. The girl meant well by bringing us napkins but didn't clean the table until we were ready to leave.  sat with a table spilled with water dripping to the floor. The place was not busy just 2 other tables were occupied. Don't think I'll be coming back.
5 Literally eating the breakfast now that I just ordered 20 minutes ago. The chef does a great job. Very reasonable pricing and everything is made from scratch. I'm eating the breakfast sliders with pepper jack and sausage and potatoes covered in gravy. I highly recommend for $6.75. And the fresh squeezed oj though simple is delicious. Chef found out I had a kid at the house and threw in a free doughnut with sprinkles. Very nice guy. More people need to go here so we can keep local gems like this one around!!!
1 I was very encouraged to try this place out after reading some previous reviews. I went there with my girlfriend in hopes of uncovering a good local breakfast spot. We ended up ordering the biscuit sliders and the Taylor ham egg sandwich. You build your biscuit sandwich so I asked if I could mix and match. The waitress said I could, so I got one with bacon and cheddar and one with sausage and pepper jack. I got an immediate "wow, so your going to be difficult"...which I was trying to avoid by asking for permission. I don't know if set off the staff by such a rediculous request, but it took us about an hour to get our food. Another couple came in 30 minutes after us and they got their food at the same time we did. We were sitting at the bar watching the chef frantically cooking the entire time, but did not see any food coming out. At no point did anyone come over and apologize for the wait or explain why it took so long, I'm still confused at what happened. On top of that, the waitress doubled charged me for my coffee but we were late and I was set on getting out of there at that point so I didn't even bring it up.   About 4 tables finished up and left while we were there, none of which were fully cleared off or cleaned. When a new customer came in, the waitress would just pick a table that didn't have left over napkins and cups on it.  I will say that the homemade biscuits were very good and the meal itself was very tasty. Unfortunately due to the extremely poor service there is no way I would ever go back.
2 This place gets 2 stars only because the food was pretty tasty. The service was terrible and no one who worked there seemed to mind. We waited almost an hour for our food even though there were only a few other tables there. We were also seated in the corner of the breakfast bar directly in front of a giant oozing chocolate syrup container (so appetizing!) The waitress did come by several times to refill coffee but at no point did she apologize for the extremely long wait. She also didn't at any point clear the five or so tables that had already left, so we had to look at that the whole time, in addition to the chocolate syrup in my face. Also, a couple who came in half hour after us got our food at the same time we did. When the food finally came it was good (biscuits and egg sandwiches,) but so not worth the wait.
1 We've been here twice now and while the 1st visit was decent enough for us to give it another shot, there will be no return visit.  The food is good enough- please don't misunderstand - but the service is AWFUL. With just 2 other tables to cover, our waiter left us sitting for 15 minutes with menus in front of us, no apologies, no water, NOTHING. When he finally got around to taking our order, he had to have us repeat it several times. When I asked what kind of yogurt they offered with the granola and yogurt on the menu, he said he didn't know and took another 5 minutes (literally) to come back and tell me strawberry.   At the 45 minute mark, he came back and asked my husband what kind of cheese and how did he want his eggs cooked again.. he forgot (yet he wrote it down when he took the order?) I started to tell him if they hadnt started cooking yet to forget it, we would leave since all I had was a semi cold cup of coffee served to us). He told me they had, an obvious lie, as my dish of yogurt and granola didn't need cooking and he was asking about the eggs and went away again for another few minutes.   All said and done, including paying the bill this quick breakfast took us over an hour.   I know the frustration on the wait was exacerbated by the alternatively whining/screaming child at the table behind us, which isn't their fault, but still made the already bad experience worse (side rant - parents? If your kid is sick, KEEP THEM HOME! The women didn't apologize, but told the waiter during one of the 4 trips the kid and grandma took to the car to calm her down from the screaming temper tantrum, "no, shes not usually like this but she has a fever and doesn't feel well"  Seriously?)  I'm sorry to see a small business suffer but the owner needs to hire some help and make sure his customers are attended to. I'm generally a patient and forgiving person, and would have been fine if they employed even one basic customer service skill.
5 This place deserves your business.  As their name implies, they put some focus on their biscuits.  Unlike most places, they keep their biscuits uncooked until you order them.  You can see the biscuits on a tray and watch them pop it in the oven when you order.  There's a daily special for biscuits...today was cheddar jalapeno. Ordered the sliders.  You choose from sausage or bacon as well as cheese and how you want your eggs cooked.  Biscuit was nice and fluffy...had a good flavor.  Eggs were cooked perfectly as requested.   My only quibble would be the potatoes.  Think I got a less than optimal batch oas it was overly crunchy.  I like crispy but there should be a good ratio of soft potato as well.   Highly recommend this place.  Service was good and they offered me a free pastry pre meal.
5 Its the difference between a cook and a chef personally preparing your meal along with the smile of an Angel server delivering to your table.
5 I don't get the negative reviews people, high maintenance people, having a bad day or a one off, I guess. The food is great so is the service. I've been here twice and its a restaurant well deserving of your business as stated in other reviews. The biscuits are wonderful so is the gravy. My favorite has been the biscuit sliders. The staff is also very flexible with request to mix and match and accommodate my requests. I hope to return soon.
5 I love this spot! The food is awesome and I have been here many times for lunch and breakfast and everything has always been spot on. It's sometimes slow, but it's because they make everything fresh for you right then and it's worth the wait! It's also super affordable.
2 We were visiting family during Thanksgiving weekend. On black friday we decided to check this place out for breakfast. 1) it was close to my brother's house. 2) it was new and 3) Biscuits are great!  We walked in, it looks so great inside! We get seated really fast seeing as how we are the 2nd group in the entire restaurant. We sit down and order our drinks. My brother and husband ordered coffee, I got an iced tea and my sister in law got a soda. The tea was rotten, always something I fear when ordering tea, but shouldn't have to in a place like this, so I thought. It must've been sitting for a little bit. Apparently Vegas people don't drink tea.   No biggie, we go to order our breakfast. I got the eggs and bacon but needed to get a biscuit on the side to try it. With biscuits in the name, you have to try it right? All they had was jalapeno cheddar biscuits. What?? I appreciate stepping outside the box and trying more than just the standard biscuit but I can't stand jalapenos so I didn't get one. My brother and husband got them though and they said they were good, not so overwhelming on the jalapenos. The rest of the food was good but I was bummed that the one thing I wanted to try I couldn't.   The owner I'm assuming, came by and talked with us later and asked how we liked the food. The guys answered that everything was great. He said they make the biscuits fresh and don't let them sit for long so we just made the cutoff to get the ones they had. That's great, but I wish they would've had at least just a plain option for those of us who can't handle the extreme flavors.   I don't know if I'd go back again, because of the lack of food choices as well as the lack of service from our waitress. She seemed like she was from Philly, really nice girl but just didn't care. There was literally a point when the only other couple there left, we were alone. We turned around and we were literally alone. Noone was in the kitchen, noone at the front. Kind of weird. I ran out of my nasty tea and never got to get a water refill.   Maybe later on down the road when they get the kinks out it will be better? I mean, growing up in Vegas I know the customer service is rather lacking but...
5 Tried this restaurant on the recommendation of other Yelp reviews. LOVE good biscuits and I was not disappointed! Went with 3 other friends and we were all pleased with our choices. Tasty food; great value for the amount of food we received; two waitresses waited on us and did a good job of keeping our drinks refilled, pleasant service, etc. - even gave us a free donut while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. I don't live on this side of Las Vegas but I would drive over again to enjoy their breakfast. Plenty of breakfast items to chose from on the menu, whether you are into biscuits or not. The decor is tastefully done, as well. Just need a permanent sign outside instead of the banner - let people know you are here to stay.
5 I really liked this place.  Service was attentive and friendly.  The food was great!  I think it's a little odd that they have a "biscuit of the day" and not an option for traditional "plain" biscuit but the BOD was cheddar the day I went so I was more than happy. I had the biscuit sliders with scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese and bacon.  I probably didn't need the two they give you but I ate them both because they were so good.  My friend and I hung around for quite a while chatting after we finished eating and the chef brought us out two chocolate chip cookies straight from the oven on the house!  It was nice to feel like they appreciated having us there instead of wanting us to get out of their hair.  I'll definitely be back!
5 This place is absolutely the best breakfast spot. Kid friendly, great food chill ambiance.
1 wow what a dissapointment !  never will eat there again !  almost an hour for our food with 4 customers there !  warm drinks w no ice !  server moves at a snails pace!  i odered the hawian burger w griled onions med well  got a raw undercooked pink burger w raw onions ! i sent it back after waiting 55 mins and was told it would only take 20 more mins to make another one ! which made me laugh actually  ! save your time and money !!.
4 Got a breakfast sandwich and hash browns from here one day it was delicious. Only one guy cooking I appreciate that as a cook myself. Only one waitress though I felt a little bad for her but overall very good and very good food
1 Guests BEWARE, my advice if you dine here is PAY ATTENTION!!!! Food lines the kitchen counters that should be under refrigeration! Bacon & Sausage sits in a pan on top of the grill ALL DAY. Fresh squeezed OJ could be half fresh from machine and the rest from a picture from up to days juiced earlier! Iced Tea not brewed fresh daily!!!!
5 I want to start with a disclosure. My wife and I have become close to the people that work here. They have always been good to us! I am disappointed to see reviews that talk about poor service! I simply can't imagine getting poor service here...I have seen the place be very busy and have never witnessed what the other reviews discussed (long wait times etc). The gentleman that was here 2-3 months ago is no longer here. He may have been the problem.   The food is almost always fantastic and I have never had a meal that I would describe as less than good. The service is always fantastic and this place feels like home. I would encourage people to give this place a try and see for yourself.
5 Great tasting food, even better service and cost. A must try. Small business, no crowd either time I was there. I was offered a fresh pastry while waiting for fresh pot of coffee to brew.
3 It's hard not to root for this neighborhood breakfast spot.  In Feb they had weekday (Tues to Fri) breakfast specials for less than 4 dollars.  You can get waffles, pancakes, or French toast paired with eggs for less than what you would pay at Denny's.  The food is not elevated, high-end cuisine by any means but for the value you're getting a great home cooked breakfast.  The biscuits were also definitely good paired with the gravy.  The reason I can't give it 4 or 5 stars is based on service.  Now typically I don't really care about service as long as it's not horrible and if I get good food. If service were better I d give it 4 stars tops.  We came on a Sun with only one other table.  The server couldn't multi-task worth sh1t and neither could the cook who was apparently working his first shift.  They were nice though I have to say.  If I lived closer I would frequent more often and may come to find that this visit was an outlier to what type of service you would expect and thus my rating would be higher.    If you're in the area - check this place out. You really can't beat the value - no item is over 9 dollars with most items being 5-6 dollars.  My guess is this is more along the lines of 4 stars but I came on a bad day.
5 Great coffee!!!!  Great neighborhood place for breakfast at a great price. I had the two egg breakfast.  My over easy eggs were perfect.  The hash browns were crisp and delicious.  My BF got the blueberry waffle special - just the way I like them - Crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.  The fresh squeezed OJ was delicious!  And did I mention the coffee?!?!  Our server was super attentive and sweet.  They have a Friday date night prix fixe menu that we will be trying.  BYOB!
5 I knew this place would be good when I walked in and there were fresh eggs on the kitchen counter! How nice to see that they used real  We came here on a Saturday morning at 9:30 am, and there was hardly anyone here. I found it refreshing that their menu was simple and not not overwhelming. The waitress was super friendly and really good with her suggestions - she pushed us to try the cheddar jalapeno biscuit, and I am so glad we did!  We got the breakfast burrito, turkey bacon, egg whites, coffee, and a biscuit. And YES, the biscuits are fantastic - fresh, hot, soft in the middle. So good! Coffee is great and is served in gigantic mugs so they don't have to bug you a million times to top it off.   Service was great. Food was great. Atmosphere was great as well. Such a good place to come for a weekend breakfast.  I absolutely will come back for their date night menu. $21.95/person for a set menu, and you are allowed to bring your own beer, wine, etc.
3 I wish I could rate this higher. Along with most of you, I love supporting local restaurants and businesses - especially if it's a breakfast joint. However, while the food was decent, nothing about my experience really stood out.   Walking in, my friend and I were the only ones in there, except for one person seated at the counter about to leave. I wasn't sure whether the lack of customers was because the food was bad or simply because it was late morning on a Thursday.   I ended up getting the breakfast sliders, due to many good reviews of it here on yelp. Yes the biscuits were fresh, and yes they were good. But overall, the dish was just meh. My sausage was super oily and the potatoes were underseasoned. As for my coffee? Super burnt, which is usually a huge indicator that it's just been sitting on the warmer for quite some time. It was completely and utterly undrinkable.   Sad to say, I probably wouldn't recommend this spot next time my friends and I are trying to find somewhere to eat. But, if any of them want to try it, I wouldn't be opposed to giving it a second chance.
5 My favorite diner in Vegas! Try the breakfast burrito or New York style burger anytime!
4 I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in.  Nice buildout, very clean.  I like that you can watch the chefs prepare your food right in front of you.  Food was solid.  Service was ok.  It was quite busy and our waitress was trying her best to accommodate everyone.   All in all im happy to have found a new breakfast go to close to home!
5 Malted waffle rocked, light and fluffy. Not too sweet, just right.  Croissant w/ egg, cheese, tasty sausage, was delicious!  Breakfast potatoes were super flavorful too, nothing was too rich though. Loved it!
4 I love the biscuits and they have wonderful service Not the traditional path, so no visiting here when we feel like having mama's Biscuits and Gravy. Original
5 This place was great! We were the first people there at 8 am, but it is a cozy little diner. The pancake sandwich was good, the sausage was tasty, but the real deal was the biscuit sandwich with fresh squeezed orange juice to wash it down! So tasty.  Pretty good for the price
2 Food was good. Young girl at front wasnt very nice, when asked to sit at a table that had 4 seat she told us it was reserved and put us by the wall. The so called reserved tables were never used well we ate. Saw them turned away customers because all the 2 seat tables were taken. I wont be going back there.  Thats what we get for trying a new place out.
2 Food was good.  I had the New York burger which was very good.  But the two stars is because of the awful service.  It took five minutes to be seated, and they ran out of biscuits.  Will not be back again.
3 Food was ok, arrived mid morning only two people at the bartop another three parties on dining room tables and nobody greeting at the front door. took about 15 minutes to place an order. I ordered french toast with sausage took another 15 minutes.  While the food was good took a little too long for the environment.  sever never checked after food was dropped. sadly cant say I would go out of my way to pass ihop to go back there
5 Love the menu. Breakfast and burgers. California burger medium well please. Fresh squeezed orange juice and fresh fruit. I'm loving it!
4 The food is great! Everything there is made fresh! The cook really take pride into making his food. The burgers are amazing! Biscuits is great! I really like the chili as well. There's nothing on the menu that I didn't like...The best part is the $ the price is not as high as the other breakfast spot. The only reason I only gave it a 4 star is because of the services. Sad to say but The services is really SLOW we went for Friday date night and we re there for over  2.5 hours and that's not because we wanted to stay and hangout. Even if the services is slow we still go back for the food :)
4 Good food, a simple menu and friendly staff.  This is my kind of breakfast spot.  I like to come in and eat slowly while reading a book.  They never rush me and keep my coffee hot.  Make your own biscuit sliders, the food is good, almost like a home cooked meal.  It's quiet in here as well so I get a chance to relax and clear my mind.  They always bring a pastry tray by, all made fresh in house.  I finally gave in today and had one of the best donuts I can remember.
4 Breakfast very good, super friendly people inside, they have some good deals during the week.  Would definately recommend.
5 So delicious! Joe is AMAZING! Got the waffle and it jut melts in your mouth :) Mmmmm!!
1 Asked the waiter to start with a side salad with no tomatoes blue cheese crumbles and ranch. Then ordered a cheeseburger medium well. The salad did not come until my cheeseburger was already ready instead of putting tomatoes on my salad they added green bell peppers which I do not care for or want to eat so after they took it back I was already halfway through my french fries and wanting to start on my cheeseburger not caring about my salad since it did not come before my entree when I started eating my cheese burger I noticed it was not medium well cooked most of the way through but it was more medium rare and I was extremely upset as I have been in the restaurant business for 13 years and I know the difference between rare medium rare and so on when I asked to speak to the manager or the owner it took about 15 minutes for them to come and talk to myself and as I told him I did not want to complain and I do not want anything for free as I had already paid my bill but did not eat my food I just wanted to bring it to his attention he did not seem very interested in what I have to say I will not be returning and I will definitely not be letting anyone know about this place
