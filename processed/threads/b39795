5 I highly recommend Happy Dogs.  The groomer was prompt,  very friendly, genuinely cares about your pets.  She was efficient, took about 1 hour for a maltese/poodle mix.  She also trimmed my big dog's nails.  Pricing was extremely reasonable - less than I had paid at Petsmart!  Nails were grinded for no extra fee.  I will definitely use Happy Dogs routinely and tell all my friends about the service!
5 Jolene is awesome!! She has always worked great with us on scheduling. She is so great with our dog, he loves her. We highly recommend Happy Dogs Grooming!
5 Fantastic! Jolene is very kind, patient and genuine.  She treats our shih tzu's as she would her own.  Do not hesitate to call and request her service.   Just know because of the great customer service she is very busy and may take a few weeks to get a date :-). Well worth with it though!
