4 My Mom (89) has been with Solari for almost two years. She is in the Hospice at Home program. Her treatment by the visiting Nurse and other staff has been wonderful. She has on occasion needed to spend some in-patient time. The facility is clean, the rooms are beautiful and well equipped. The staff is friendly, attentive, and caring.   Mom is eager to see the visiting staff each day. She actually enjoys going to the in-patient facility when she is having a problem as they provide her great care and a lot of relaxation. I am happy by what i see of her care at home and in-patient.  This is a fine place for my Mom. If it is ever necessary for my wife or I to use hospice care we will use Solari.
5 My aunt spent her last few days at this facility and received nothing but the best of care.  As a family, we are very grateful.
5 My grandma spent her last days here and my mom had a great support system in the staff until I arrived in town. Grandma was treated with dignity and care until she passed. My whole family is grateful for a comfortable place for granny to reach her homecoming.
