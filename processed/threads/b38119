5 Work right down the street and saw this place on ABC. Few co-workers and I gave it a shot and was thrilled at the size and taste of the slice. Crispy crust, great cheese, and they did not skimp on the toppings...only take-out and delivery but the staff was awesome and for the price you can't beat it. Looking forward to a second trip!
4 Ok, I am not a regular connoisseur of pizza -mainly because when I hang out with other folks it is the typical default.  Thus goes this tradition ever since I left the Bay Area (it was a different game altogether then and so I am NOT crazy about crazy gourmet pizzas anymore). When left to my own devices, I avoid it.  I am almost positive that after ordering the pepperoni and sausage pizza yesterday, I will become a fullfledged addict complete with weekly group meetings and confessions, and relaspses.  The crust -usually my least favorite part -and I always leave evidence behind, was exquisite.  There is something about the gluten percentage that is worth mentioning.  It was sooo good in fact, that I may just order a regular cheese pizza the next time and I NEVER go that route.  And then there's the cheese....Oh, did I mention the warm welcome I received??  Ok, back to the pizza.  Wow..  Four stars only because I am a cynic.  Nobody gets 5 stars from a person who owns 150 cookbooks the first time out.  I will revisit the restaurant as well as the 5th star.   P.S.  Almost too small to dine in and that is just fine with me.
3 I was really looking forward to this opening up near work. Who doesn't need another gourmet pizza joint nearby? While it was good, it wasn't amazing. A few co-works and myself walked over and after much hemming and hawing, we each order the lunch special. You can get a slice of pizza, a side salad, and a drink for $4.99. Or you can get two slices of pizza and a drink for $4.99. I opted for the special pizza of the day (vegetarian - black olives, green peppers, and onion) with a side salad (lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and I picked cilantro lime dressing). Others tried the cheese and pepperoni pizza.   Back in the office, we chowed down. I didn't much care for the salad dressing - way to overpowering. The pizza was pretty good. The crust was fine - not my favorite. The slices were huge though. Bonus points for that. My co-workers liked their cheese and pepperoni and agreed the slices were huge. Again, nothing special. I think we all agreed we'd definitely give it another try but maybe order one of their specialty pizzas to split.
4 This place makes some tasty pizza and has great prices. I had the lunch special, so two slices of pepperoni and a drink. Well worth the $5.   Their large cheese pizza starts at $8.95 which is a fantastic deal.   My only suggestion to the company would be to save their to go pizza boxes for to go orders. It's probably cheaper and I feel bad wasting a box when I'm going to eat those pizzas up in like 2 minutes flat.
4 Happy to have a new pizza option in my neighborhood!  The pizza is tasty and the cheese is REALLY good.  We also had bread with olive oil.  The fresh baked bread is so yummy with the garlic olive oil.  Also, and this is important to me, the service is great!  They just opened and you can tell they really want to make this a neighborhood place.  The second time we called in an order that asked if we wanted the pepperoni and mushroom again.  I think that's a nice touch.
4 The only item ordered was a pizza to go.  Although the crust and toppings were fine, the underside of the crust had an excess of cornmeal, which made each bite a little gritty.  The manager/owner(?) who I chatted with was very nice, and except for the cornmeal everything else was fine.  However, for me, the cornmeal is a deal breaker.  Updated Sep 7 2013: After a few more visits, I'm updating my rating from 3 to 4 stars; the cornmeal issue which I experienced on my first visit is no longer a problem.  One additional thing I noticed is that on the bottom of the pizza box, there's a piece of corrugated cardboard, which keeps the bottom of the pizza from sitting flat on the box and lets air circulate (keeping the crust crustier?).  Offering a thin crust option on the menu would be worth that fifth star!
3 We order the 20" cheese pizza for $14.11 last night for dinner and thought it was very good.  Giant Rustic Pizza is located in the Safeway shopping area, next to after school learning center Kumon and Leslie Pool supplies.  This is a take-out only store that has seating outside.  Besides selling whole and half pies, Giant Rustic sells by the slice, along with salads and artisan breads.  The latter is mainly for the lunch crowd, but it seems to have attracted some of the parents waiting for their kids at Kumon.  The pizza is a very large twenty inch pie that is tasty.  The smaller 14" pies are called Large.  Although it is a thin crust, the bread is very chewy.  Our family of three thought is was a little too chewy, but that is a matter of taste. The dough they use seems above average, while the pizza sauce was not seasoned very much.  The light dusting of cheese on top was just enough to cover the pie.  Compared to the other pizza places within a few miles of this location, Giant Rustic's is closer to NYPD, than Ray's or Corleone's in terms of style.  NYPD tends to be chewier of the three.  We liked the pizza and all the energy and extras the new owners bring.  The prices seem in line -- somewhat less than Ray's and NYPD; but more than Corleone's for a similar sized pizzas. As I've mentioned, the 20" Giant Rustic Pizza is $12.95, while the 14" Large Rustic Pizza is $8.95. Additional toppings are $1.75 each for the Giant and $2.50 each for the Large. All prices are before AZ sales tax.  Giant Rustic also serves sandwiches that are made with their Artisan bread for $7.95.  They include Chipotle Turkey Slaw, BMT, Tuscan Veggie and Italian Bird (Turkey).  In the case next to the counter, they sell Giant Salads for $8.95, with names like Sonoran Chicken, Mediterranean, Italian Kitchen, California Dreamin and The All American. They all looked good, so I'll be back at some point for lunch.  So Three Stars, "A-OK".
3 ******* Crust was VERY TASTY *******                  ******** Tomato Sauce was not a Winner **********                          ******** Cheese had nice Flavor ************        Compared to the National and Regional Chains ........ Giant Rustic is Terrific.                 The Folks at the Store were very appreciative of my business.  Other Pizzerias have failed at this location ..... They're here to stay in my opinion.            Per my tastes ..... the tomato sauce needs a bit of spicing up.                           That's All Folks ......... We'll definitely be back .
2 As a precursor to our "Veg-out and be lazy no cooking Thursday before a 3 day long weekend", we finally headed to Giant Rustic to try their pies.  My rating is actually 2.5 as the extra half is really for friendly service however we were disappointed with the final product. It's hot and ready to go in 15 min as we chose to go order and pick it up. But as Georgie alluded, the sauce was lack luster and ruined the experience for me, bad sauce = bland pizza. Perhaps ordering some protein toppings or calamata olives would've brought a pop of flavor, but to get the basic cheese pizza on the wrong side of flavor town is a big deal breaker for me.   Perhaps it's a grand opening type of case where we hope that the owners will in fact fine tune their recipe as also having delivery in our N. Sctsdl area is a marketing advantage for Giant to captivate given very extremely reasonable pricing. May try back in a couple months and hope for an improved experience.
5 This place has great pizza. Huge pies with great prices!  We will absolutely be back!
4 Value for money, great service and a good product. Small touches like the condiment basket and flowers on tables appealed to me.  A casual place with great potential.  Very good service and an overall good experience.  A great lunch special - 2 huge slices, and a drink (not even fountain drinks, the real deal!) for $4.95
5 I was in the area and saw this place next to my market. I went in, asked for a slice of pie. I am a HARD CORE PIZZA JUNKIE and I take everything into consideration. Even all the way down to how I can fold and eat it.  I have to say that this pie and the others I have had since are top notch.   Crust was flavorful and had a perfect brick oven crisp. sauce was made by an east coaster and fresh. the basil and fresh herbs were forward but not in your face. cheese was def whole milk. the pep was large large and a m a z i n g.  SO in short, give this place a try, you'll love the pie.   peace out trbs
4 ************ Ask Them To Add 2 Herbs *************        On my 1st visit ........ I found the Tomato Sauce ...... Bland for my taste.        Last Night ...... by adding 2 herbs prior to baking...... the sauce was Terrific.                      The "Magic Two" ............Basel and Oregano.
4 A new pizza place by work, yay!  I was very excited to try out this place for lunch, and I thought the food was very yummy.  Even though its called giant rustic PIZZA, they offer salads and sandwhiches as well.  Their specialties pizzas are a bit higher pricing than I was expecting, but the lunch specials are a good price.
5 Went here last night and it was fantastic!! The quality of the ingredients really showed and the prices were very low. I had the Malibu bbq chicken pizza and I loved it. The service was quick and very friendly as well. Definitely give it a try!
3 I shop at the Safeway nearby and had my eye on this joint since construction. I was excited to receive a flyer in the mail and promptly ordered a large pizza, half big berlesconi and half spinach, sun dried tomatoes, and Gorgonzola cheese. I also ordered the Sonoran chicken salad. Surprisingly, the salad was much better than the pizza. While the toppings were exquisite, the sauce was bland and the dough was generic.  Three stars are for the fast and friendly service, the amazing toppings, and manageable prices.  If Giant Rustic Pizza could improve their sauce and dough, I'd bump up the rating.
2 No flavor!!!  This pizza joint is from the prior owners of NYPD pizza who sold and started this new place.  While its a decent price point there is no taste to it. Crust is mediocre and the sauce is just awful. It's like they opened a can of tomato sauce and dumped it on the dough. Meh!
4 Excellent pizza, and nice salads to go.
5 Great pizza, kids love it!
4 My family and I tried this Giant Rustic Pizza last weekend.  Overall, we enjoyed the pizza and salads and will definitely return.  My boys (3 1/2 year old twins) are sometimes picky eaters... but not with this pizza.  They absolutely loved it.  I didn't find it too oily, bland, or soggy, and the crust was pretty darn good.  I like putting crushed red pepper on mine, so that's probably why I didn't notice if the sauce needed anything.  As for the salads, there were very generous portions of meat on the Italian Kitchen and my California Dreamin was excellent.  The employees were all very friendly and personable... which is a good quality to have in a food service business.  Like many new restaurants, I'm sure the small kinks will be worked out over time.
5 Pretty big pizza that is crunchy and done right.  A slice from this place does remind me of a New York style pizza, but clearly the taste isn't NY at all (which is not a bad thing)  Every time I come in, staff is attentive and awesome.  They are very friendly and down to earth employees.  Even the guys in the back look like they just love their job, which to me is very important.  Their smiles and laughs put on a huge image on the quality of work they put into their service.    They have a great selection of other food besides pizza such as Artisan type Cheese Garlic Bread, Salads, Wings, you name it.  As good as their other stuff is, their main focus is Pizza.  I'm not a food expert, I can only judge what my taste buds allow me to taste.  Everyone has a personal preference on what a good pizza is.  Obviously there is nothing here that will come close to NY or CHICAGO pizza, so people should stop trying to compare cultural tastes.  Giant Rustic Pizza is good because the dough is crisp.  Pizza is cooked to be well done without it being burnt, from the tip of the slice up to the crust,   If you order a slice or pie with toppings, they have just the right amount of items to put on.  Sauce and Cheese taste regular, I don't really understand how that can be made any better?  Every pizza shop in town uses cans of tomato sauce and pre-packed cheese (I know because I worked for them)  Overall, If you are looking for something with a gimmick and adventurous, this isn't the place.  If you are looking for a quick bite or just don't feel like cooking tonight, Giant Rustic Pizza makes that an easy decision.  Minor problem is that they don't deliver to my place (a 10 minute drive ) however, I don't mind coming to this place and enjoying a slice and a good conversation.
3 Pizza is such a personal thing that reasonable people can disagree, but we were a bit underwhelmed by Giant Rustic.  I agree with a prior reviewer -- the crust is meh, and the sauce could use some punch. But the toppings are good and there are a couple of good varieties on tap, so if you like a thicker crust this is worth a try.  We did not partake of the salad, but the key lime pie was OK.  I also concur the staff there is very friendly and attentive -- no problems there -- and the price is good compared to some other local options.
5 My husband and I LOVE this place! Giant is no exaggeration... and seriously, you cannot be the price! Great pizza, wonderful and friendly customer service and all around good  pizza!
5 I really wanted to like Giant Rustic...and I do! They opened up shop in my local Safeway shopping center, an area where pizza places haven't done too well. They have some interesting flavor profiles on their menu, so I was looking forward to giving them a try.   If you can't decide on just one style of pizza, they offer half-and-halfs at no charge. This was a great idea for me, because with a 20" giant specialty pizza ($17.95), you won't get bored with the leftovers. I chose half Big Berlesconi (sliced sausage, pepperoni, and Genoa salami) and half Oahu Wave (Canadian ham, pineapple, and fresh cilantro). I was impressed with the quality of the meats...large thin slices, not greasy at all, and full of flavor. Both sides were delicious. The cilantro gave the Oahu Wave a unique twist, that complimented the pineapple's sweetness and the ham's smokiness. The Berlesconi half was simply phenomenal.  I also tried an Italian Market salad ($8.95) with Chipotle Ranch. Salads at pizza places tend to be afterthoughts. Not here. Fresh crisp romaine was topped with roasted red pepper strips, tomato, olive tapenade, artichoke hearts, thinly sliced red onion, and little bundles of salami, ham, and mozzarella cheese. I couldn't believe how good the salad was...the roasted peppers and artichoke hearts were spectacular, the tomato tasty, the olive tapenade zesty. There wasn't a weak component in this salad. The dressing was probably the best I've had, with the smokiness of chipotle rounding out that creamy ranch flavor.  A word about the sauce and crust. The crust is unique. It's not thin and it's not thick...it has a yeasty "chew" to it, but it's not doughy. You can fold a slice in half to accommodate eating, and it won't split. I think it's a perfect platform for their pizzas, and their use of the word "artisan" their crust is accurate. The sauce is nice and fresh, and not too thick. It's not overloaded with dried spices or canned tomato paste like other pizza joints' sauce, and I think some reviewers probably prefer that type of sauce. Rustic's sauce and crust compliments the pizza, and allows the flavor of premium toppings to come forward. If you prefer a saucier pizza, they will willingly add extra sauce prior to baking.   The customer service is friendly, knowledgable, and accommodating. They know their products, right down to their desserts (though not made on premises, the Key Lime Pie at $3.95 was quite good). I really enjoyed their food and will be back, the only problem being what to try next. As I was inside waiting for my pizza, a fellow customer said I really needed to try their sandwiches...so who knows!
5 We stopped by last nigt and picked up a 20in. Half chesse and half pepperoni pie and a cheese garlic bread blossom. It was our first time ordering food from this place not knowing anything about this pizzeria. I don't even know where to begin, it was simply a NY pizza pie!!! If your from NY like me, you know what I'm saying. I've lived the in az for long 4 yrs and really gave up on pizza. The dough is a perfect combination of crisp and chewy, folds in half perfectly. The chesse is made from whole milk mozzarella, the sauce is fresh and light! I was reading some past reviews people complaining the sauce needs more herbs, I guess if you're used to dominos pizza or this NYPD pizza which is a disgrace to ny pizza. Ny marinara is fresh, bright and light. I can't relate to the comments a out the crust, the crust is freakin amazing! The pizza here seriously takes me back home, THANK YOU RUSTIC PIZZA!! The chessey garlic bread was out of this world, I.can't say that I had anything like that in ny but I loved it. I was so taken back by this pizza, I called back to speak to the manager. I asked was it intentional that the pizza tastes exactly like a ny slice and Cindy said YES! The owners are from ny and had a lab  create the same water you would find in Yonkers,ny. It's funny because all these pizzerias claiming to have ny pizza and they dont, not even close! Rustic pizza doesn't even claim to have NY pizza and they do. For all my fellow New Yorkers, suffering here in the valley, go to Giant Rustic Pizza, you'll be glad you did. You will feel like you're back home!
5 Awesome pizza, family-owned. Never fails to please an office full of hungry men!
4 Love that they deliver to our area and especially to work! Good salad and pizza, love the cheese bread!
3 I ordered two pizzas and garlic knots for takeout when they first opened about 4 months ago. To be honest, the food was good but not great. It was way way too doughy and lacked significant flavor. It was not cheap ($45 for my order) and I just wasn't blown away. The place was immaculate and the owner/manager was very nice and accommodating but it just wasn't what I expected.  Maybe that's because I am full Italian and I know a great pie when I try one. I had heard so many great things about them too. I would say try it but don't expect anything out of this world.
4 6/22/13  4 stars for my first visit to Giant Rustic Pizza!  Prior to my call for takeout, I called to ask a few questions regarding allergy issues I have with corn- does GRP use corn meal in the production of the crusts?  How about in the oven?  (Some restaurants don't use corn meal to help add crunch to their crusts, but a LOT of places use it to keep the bottoms of the pizzas from sticking to the oven floor, and this sadly keeps me from enjoying past favorites and from trying new places that are on everyone's list of bookmarks.  I'm happy to report that GRP does not use corn meal at all.  The person on the phone was very helpful in answering my questions, and for those that he couldn't answer himself, he offered to ask those in the kitchen who could.  After we hung up, I continued to look over GRP's webpage and decided I'd order the 14" Big Sky (cheese with five toppings) for $15 plus tax.  I normally forgo red-sauced pizzas, but something told me to try one of each, so I went for two orders of Big Sky- a white pizza with ricotta, spinach, artichokes, seasoned feta, and garlic, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/giant-rustic-pizza-scottsdale?select=VP28FVb81R7KblTMVv_nDw#VP28FVb81R7KblTMVv_nDw and a red pizza with Italian sausage, pepperoni, ricotta, spinach, and artichokes. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/giant-rustic-pizza-scottsdale?select=9QDrj92eJNOydcrH78tYCQ#9QDrj92eJNOydcrH78tYCQ  I vaguely remember saying something like "Oh, but these photos online of the crusts don't look like thin-crusts to me," to which the GRP rep said, "but we can do thin-crusts, if you'd like."  Oh, yes I do! The phone rep was calm and did not seem to be in any rush and answered all of my questions.  This surprised me, since I thought the more people they could rush orders through on the phone, the more pizzas they could be baking and selling.  I suppose I'm just like many people who are used to rude service on the phone.  Thank you, GRP for being different!  :)  When I walked in to retrieve my pizzas, the two people at the cash registers were very welcoming and had big smiles for me.  Greeting customers with smiles sounds so simple, and yet this single act alone can make the receiver of the smile feel like a $100!  The staff at GRP also make it a point to open the pizza boxes to show you what your pizzas look like, and to see if they meet your approval.  These looked and smelled AMAZING, and when I got home, I found that they also tasted divine!  A little too heavy on the ricotta, but I will never complain about too much ricotta, since I can always take some off, but too little is something to whine about...  Each pizza had their merits, and I wholeheartedly recommend ordering pizzas with red sauce from here.  I am a die-hard white pizza fan, so when I tell you the red sauce is good here, you better believe it!  During my first ten years of life in Manila, I ate SO many sweet Filipino-style spaghetti, and while they were delicious enough for me, I do not favor sweet pasta sauce anymore.  GRP's is very tasty, tangy, and zesty.  I also enjoyed the white pizza-- I recommend adding the feta for a little kick, since the ricotta can be a little sweet.
4 My husband found this place for my monthly pizza cravings and WE LOVE IT!  Staff is super friendly and the pizza is delicious - not to mentioned reasonably priced.  It's our new fav!
4 Pretty good pizza. I like that they have baked wings that are crispy. Next time  to try the salads...
5 In Arizona this is as good as Pizza gets. I'm originally from New England and one of my favorite pizza places is an oven baked pizza from Papa Ginos. The reason that pizza resonates is that it always has a crispy bottom layer, fantastic dough, quality cheese and just enough sauce to support the dough and cheese.   Giant Rustic Pizza has all of this. The mouth-feel when consuming the pizza is amazing. Often you will get to much dough, to much cheese, or some tart overdone sauce out here from the generic Pizza places, but this is all well balanced. If you order the 20 incher your eyes will pop out of your head how big the slices are.   The customer service was amazing and friendly, they had the pizza ready on time and a smile when I came into their small shop. I kept thinking this is how a pizza place is supposed to be, and exactly how it is out east (minus the smile).  I would say throw away your coupons to Domino's and Pizza Hut and try a decent pizza for a change. Oh, and the pricing for a 20" is $13, so it's very affordable.
5 I absolutely love this place! Every time I visit they greet me by name and the food is delicious...the Belly Rewards are a huge plus also!
5 We tried Rustic during their Grand Opening and have been hooked ever since. The staff is always very friendly when we go in the shop and on the phone. We love the crust. I love both the regular sauce and their white pizza. Some of our favorite pizzas are the Santa Fe Sunset, Brooklyn Hero (half with no sausage since I'm vegetarian), Red White and Green and my boyfriend likes the Hot and Sweet.  I love that they are expanding their menu and can't wait to try some of their other options. I've already tried all 3 of their deserts and the Key Lime Pie and Cheesecake are my favorites.   We had placed an order a while back and they ended up being a little long with their delivery (so little delayed that we hadn't even noticed) and when they showed up with our food they brought a free slice of cheesecake to make up for the "delay".   I really hope they stick around because they are by far my favorite pizza place and I love that they are local and not a big chain.
2 I'm not sure where all of the 5 star reviews are coming from.  I have ordered several pizzas from here, but the pizzas come out different every time.  Sometimes they are tasty, with enough sauce and the crust is just right.  But most of the time they are just meh.  The last time we ordered, we received tasteless sauce and not enough. We decided to complain because it's happened more than once.  Oh boy, the sfaff was friendly up until that point.  They do not accept criticism very well and when we requested another pizza with more sauce, we were treated as if we were asking for a free pizza.  That is our last time visiting this place.  Oh and by the way, we paid the driver for the replacement pizza just to make a point.
2 I didnt want to be a contrarian, but I did not have a positive experience here, as others have. I ordered a giant pizza well done, and it was anything but. It was soft and mushy and disgusting. Worse still, I emailed them directly but never heard back!
4 I like this place!  We've tried the margarita pizza a couple of times and it has been excellent each time.  I've had the California Dreamin salad a couple of times as well, the salads are huge and the ingredients are incredibly fresh.  Last night we tried the red, white, and green pizza - it was a little too rich for me but I did enjoy the taste.  The crusts are light but doughy with a little bit of crunch on the bottom.  They have a great topping selection and some interesting menu items too.  Parking is a breeze because it's right next to Safeway but they deliver quickly for a few bucks if you don't feel like leaving the house.
4 Great pizza for delivery!  Prices are very reasonable too especially for the quality of the food.  I now only order from this place for delivery pizza!
5 OMG...I wish this pizza wasn't soo good. This is my go to pizza place and I go there more than I would like to admit. Not only is the taste/quality above average, you can't beat the cost and service! If you want NY style pizza, check it out. If you are a die hard Chicago pizza fan, this is not the place for you!
5 I'm a Jersey girl and I know good pizza. This is a great pizza shop!  That Italian Bird sandwich is the bomb! It's the bread that really makes it. I'm so happy that North Scottsdale has a real pizza place with delicious pizza and sandwiches. This is the real deal pizza place!
2 I've been here 3 times.   It's better than most take out pies.  It's strictly a take out place but they do have some outdoor tables that work out well, at least when the weather's nice   It's not "artisan" or anything especially fancy but it's better than most.  I like the rustic decor and the simple menu.  Why the low rating?  Based on my first visit, I had mentally given them 4 stars.    The last time I went, I wondered why the bill was so high.  I added up the prices from their website and knew what to expect.  The bill was several dollars more.   The teenager at the cash register explained that the owner decided to raise the prices but chose not to update the website.    Not cool.    He said "Yes, we have had a lot of complaints about that"  But of course, the new price is the price they are charging and if I didn't like it, I didn't have to take dinner home to all of the people sitting at home waiting for me to bring pizza. (-1 star)  That was a week ago.  Today, we ordered a large pizza.  (Their "facebook" special)   We expected their large pizza.   We got a small one.  Why?  Here, "large" is small and "giant" is "large"   Got it?    Don't order large and expect their big one; it's their small. (-1 more)  The pizza is pretty good and deserves about 3 or 3.5 stars, but I really don't like feeling short changed, especially not twice in a row.
4 This place has the right attitude as far as catering to the customer. It seems like every time I order from here and pick it up they go above and beyond to satisfy my needs to make the pizza just how I want it. I can only hope this place does well because you continue to always go to great measures.
5 Really good pizza for a very reasonable price.  Very unique take on pizza, actually.  The staff is super friendly and helpful too.  A nice departure from the norm if you ask me. Tonight was our first, and we'll be back lots more!!!
5 Giant Rustic Pizza is our go to pizza place.  So much better than the local chains.  Service is great.  Prices are very reasonable.  The delivery driver remembers us and is extremely friendly.  The pizza is DELISH!  The 20" giant pizza is huge!  Our favorites are the Santa Fe Sunset, the Malibu BBQ Chicken, and the Brooklyn Hero.  The pizza is so good, we have never gotten around to trying anything else.  Hope this place is around for a long time!
5 Craving some delish takeout? Go to Giant Rustic Pizza. Their ingredients are fresh, flavorful and gluten-free. They have a wide variety of topping options, appetizers, (wings, garlic bloom, etc.) and yummy specialty pizzas. Their crust is amazing, really soft and baked to perfection. You really owe it to yourself to stop by. I love this place.
4 Great pizza for the price!! The crust is really good with a great flavor. What really makes this place nice though is the friendly service. You definitely get the feeling that these small business owners care about their product. I would definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the neighborhood.  My only gripe is that their menu on their website and on their online ordering system don't ever seem to match. Whether its pricing or products something is always out of sync.
4 Just tried today for lunch. I'm a pizza purist, so all of those fly-by-night, fad pizza joints with their outlandish toppings and crazy flavors don't impress me. I want a good crust, balanced sauce and quality toppings - period!  Crust - This makes or breaks a pie, whether your a Chicago deep-dish lover, or Chicago thin-crust/square cut type of person or a New York afficionado. If the crust is wrong, it doesn't matter what's on the pie, you ain't gonna score any points. That being said, Giant Rustic reminds me of the street-side pizza joints in New York that are a dime a dozen, with several generations of families working in the back slinging out honest-to-God great pizza - no frills. It came out of the oven with a great crispness all the way through. The edges were big and puffy with a great crunch.   Sauce - Perfect balance between sweet and savory. Not too heavy, not too light.   Pepperoni - thin thin THIN sliced and mildly flavored. Big win. My other piece (I got the lunch special, 2 slices and a drink) was a simple cheese which was great in its simplicity. The cheese had a great melted texture that was music to my mouth.  All in all, it's a win.  Service was great, friendly, fast - everything you want for a business lunch spot. Loved the soft Italian guitar music playing in the background - apropos for the mob book I'm reading...   The ONLY reason I docked them a star is how small the place is. There is counter space for MAYBE 5 people and a few tables outside. This place has the potential to be big things but they are totally out of space for it... unless one of the places on either side of them closes down.
4 I'm an east coast native.  I like my pizza with zesty sauce, plenty of cheese, and a thin, crisp crust.  Giant Rustic Pizza delivered on my first two requirements more than any other place I've tried in the Valley. I will say I didn't love their crust--too thick, not quite crispy enough.  Still the flavors were better than any other pizza I've had here (enough so that they outweigh the less than stellar crust), so I think I've found my new pizzeria! I will note that the large pizza was pretty small.  If we were hungrier, my husband and I could easily have polished off a whole pie at dinner.
5 By far the best authentic New York style pie I have found out here is the 20" cheese. After coming here at least twice a month for the last year I have always found the 20" to have the better consistency and style than the 14" which seems a bit doughier.  Value can't be beat for the product. If you want a cheap garbage pizza go to Pizza Hut. This isn't that and yet the pricing is still as competitive as it gets, especially for a small local establishment.  While the artisan pizzas are a nice addition to have, you can't beat the basics. Try the plain cheese pizza before you try anything else and you will know that this is a top quality product.
4 Pretty good pizza. Same owners as original NYPD Pizza. I think Fired pie down the street is better.
4 I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent quality and value here. I got a $5.95 lunch special, which included a pizza slice, soda, and a nice-size salad. The pizza had a thin, crispy crust and was something called a red, white, and green--mozzarella, tomatoes, and spinach. Only complaint is the place is really small so table space is limited.
4 Good pizza, friendly staff and timely delivery. It's great to have a reliable place close by.
4 Best delivery pizza that I have eaten!  The menu offers some different variations than the usual choices available. Last time the crust wasn't as good as the previous occasions and btw, skip the cheese cake. Otherwise would have been 5 stars.
5 Great pizza with homemade ingredients. This is primarily a pickup or delivery pizza place.  Very happy with Rustic.
2 Didn't seem very rustic and just "OK".  Not worth chasing down for the first time or visiting again.
3 The pizza and wings were A-OK. I was expecting a better more flavorful pizza but it turned out ok. I had the Brooklyn Hero, the Margarita and the wigs. Not bad of a place.  I wish their pizza had more of a oomphf! to the them. But they tasted like normal NON-chained pizza which is always a good thing. Wings were pretty nice too. The dipping sauce was good.  Give it a try.. maybe it will work out for you.
5 I get coupons in the mail... $13.95 for their giant pizza! The pizza is not only delicious, it's also big enough to feed me for a week. Great deal, love this place!
3 I am overal OK with this Pizza. The biggest down I am seeing is their consistent quallity in delivery. Overall its decent and good value for the money. Issues I had are like, one pie was over crisped, another pie must have hit the side of the oven coming out so it wasnt round any more, it had a flat side to it, and one pie was almost perfect.   Tip: Call in your order to a real person. Its very confusing to use their online ordering because you have to provide the order in Halfs... meaning you do each side seperately. Its quite annoying. They use a third party provider to do the online ordering so its their dumb system,. not GRP's.   Also this is TAKE OUT Only for all practical purposes. The dining area has a few high tops and thats it.
4 Pleasantly surprised by how good this pizza is. Great selection of toppings, reasonable prices and the people who work here are very nice.  They even deliver for not as crazy a minimum or fee as most other places around. This is a good spot in this neighborhood.
5 A few weeks ago I was walking by the various shops and noticed Giant Rustic Pizza.  The pizza and sandwiches I could see people eating at their small tables outside made me want to come and try it.  Last night my wife and I stopped by there for supper.  Rather than get something to eat there, we decided instead to get their 20" pizza.  They have a special deal on the menu for a 20" with 5 toppings for a little under $20.  We chose sausage, artichoke hearts, olives, mushrooms and red peppers.  12 minutes later our massive pizza was ready for us to take home.  When our pizza was ready, they didn't just hand us to box with the pizza inside.  First, he opened the box to show us our pizza and confirm that it was what we ordered and to make sure we were happy.  This is a nice touch that I've never seen done at a pizza place before.  When we got home, we began eating the pizza.  It was awesome!  One of the best pizzas I've ever eaten.  The crust is awesome and has a bit of the wood-fired taste to it.  The toppings are very good.  My wife commented that the pizza isn't greasy like a lot of pizzas.  Anyway, this 20" pizza has given us enough pizza to last the weekend.  It's a very good value.  I'd like to try their sandwiches sometime.
4 We went here based on the reviews - this is strictly a take out place with a few high tables outside and really uncomfortable bar stools.  They do not have a fountain drink machine, all there drinks are in cans or bottles including water,  They do not make there desserts in house and the cook did not know where they were made or where they get them from.  We had the 20 inch giant rustic cheese.  A little basil on top of the cheese pizza would have made a huge difference, they informed us later just ask for it and they can put basil on it.. The pizza was a bit salty most likely the sauce and the crust was just like NY pizza thin and crusty.  We ate some there while sitting on the very uncomfortable bar stools outside and took the rest home..It tastes good the next day heating up in the oven or the toaster oven not good at all in the microwave.  Overall pretty good pizza, much better than New York Pizza Department and better than Nick's.  The price is awesome. I would like to try their salads which are located in there little frig by the cashier and they said made fresh daily.  Huge slices and 1 is enough to fill you up.  This place is not owned by the owners of NYPD like a different reviewer mentioned, it is owned by the same owner out of Anthem who owns the Mexican restaurants..
5 Outstanding!  Love the crust, the perfectly cooked toppings, you can tell they use high quality ingredients, and really care about delivering a great, consistent product. Our new favorite!
5 GREAT Pizza!!! Super fast delivery from FLWright location! New favorite place!
2 Pizza is decent. Price is awesome. Service/phone girl is absolutely God awful. Delivery is on the slower side of average. Overall, nothing special. Barros opened in the same plaza and that will probably drive them out of business if they can't stand out enough to compete with the flawless, deliciousness of barros. I hope the best, but probably won't eat here again.
4 This is a solid choice for good pizza. It's not gourmet but is certainly leaps and bounds above a Domino's or Pizza Hut. They are consistent in both the quality of food and delivery time. We are now loyal customers to this little strip mall gem!
4 Had a 14" carry out pizza and it was pretty good . Crust was nice and crispy toppings were adequate and the Canadian bacon they use is amazing!! Only thing negative to say is if you like more than a hint of sauce, ask for extra.
5 The Zucchini pizza is amazing!!!  Giant Rustic pizza is the best pizza I have ever had. The ingredients are fresh and the delivery is quick.
5 Great pizza and awesome customer service.  Thanks for being here.
1 I've ordered close to 100 pizza's from this company.  They are not cheap, and their pizza's are usually great.  I've now been on 2 phones simultaneously for 68 minutes and nobody is answering.  It is Memorial Day, but their website doesn't say that they are not open.  I'll look for a place that can service the customer.  Their hold music/message doesn't say they are closed at either location.  Screw me once, shame on me, screw me twice shame on you.
