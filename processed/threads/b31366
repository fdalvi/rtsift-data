5 If you're looking for your next sugar high, this is the place to go! I walked into this store for the first time today and I swear Angels in the heavens started to sing. lol Yes, I have a bit of a sweet tooth. ;-)  They have candy that'll take you right back to your childhood, and plenty of new treats to test out as well.  The prices are very reasonable, and will definitely make you come back for more. To top it off they also sell ice cream, drinks, smoothies and milkshakes! *drool* Even thought I had a good time browsing the shop, I can't visit very often. Don't think my waistline would appreciate it. lol
3 I've popped in here a few times to browse the selection on offer. I've not got a huge appetite for these kinds of sweets (I'm more of a chocolate fan) but there's a lot to choose from.   There are the traditional jarred, hardboiled kinds of sweets, as well as some nostalgia-brewing efforts like Refreshers, Love Hearts, Dib Dabs and Double-Dips.   After filling my basket with three small portions of jarred sweets and a selection of chewy bars, etc, I was a bit shocked to find I'd spent over Â£8! So a bit too expensive for my tastes. Still, if you want teeth rotters, this is the place to come!
1 This has now gone bust - sadly, I suspect, due to the tram works which has closed the whole of Shandwick Place.
