2 Not very hard to find, clean and stocked as all GNC stores are, but the sales girl seemed to have limited knowledge about the products. I feel that a store in this field should have employees who actually know something about the products that they are selling to the public. I am aware that in this day and age, that is something that is not commonplace, but still reduces my rating to only 2 stars!
1 First and last time in this store this afternoon.   The clerk behind the counter complained about the customer who left as I was coming in and then proceeded to lecture me about my desired supplements.  She lost over $150 sale today and many more in the future as this store is on my way home but I will go out of my way for better customer service.
2 They sell some neat stuff but most of it is overpriced. Always a good idea to use their $10 off $20 coupon or wait for their online sales.   Tip: If you like protein bars, do try their Quest bars. In store price was $33 per box and online sale came to $21 a box. Go figure!!
