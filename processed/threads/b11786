5 If you love decoration stuff If you love warm sweet and uniqe stuff If you love back to childhood time If you believe me.....  :)   Check it out! Man! I love this place so much, but just close too early (today @ 7pm)... Lucky I went there early, otherwise I'll never find this such niceeeeee store.   If you are buying gift, for wife, husband, kids... for friends, bff, gff... cards, toys, unique design cups & glasses... wedding ect..  check it out..... after you shopping here and Smith is the next door, they have so many cheap cheap foods for entire store + west union there, too!
3 The whole greeting card business is such a scam. Paying 3 to 5 bucks for a card that someone will read once then throw away seems like a waste of money and paper. But, regardless of how I feel about it, I still give in and buy my share of cards for friends and family. And, the best place to buy them is Hallmark. This location has a large selection for any and every occasion plus plenty of other gifts ranging from picture frames to stuffed animals. The employees are always helpful and happy to help you find just the right card or gift. With Valentine's Day around the corner I'll reluctantly be back.
5 I'm not gonna lie, but I love Hallmark! They have everything "sentimental" that you need or whatever you are looking for I'm sure they have it "card"wise. I'm a sucker when it comes to good cards and I've never had a problem finding the perfect card. The wrapping paper and bags are pretty dang awesome as well! They have knick knacks that can be collectibles, which is great for mom's, aunt's, grandma's, etc. All of these things can add up, but its well worth it for someone that's sappy like me!
