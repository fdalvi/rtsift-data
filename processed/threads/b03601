5 Simply the best most professional dentist/hygienist/office I have ever been to.  They are not cheap so if you don't have insurance or are looking for price primaril,y they might not be for you
1 Hygienist and dentist provide quality service which cannot be said the same for the administration. The front desk seems more interested in selling you services than providing good service. Overall bad experience as I don't like being treated as money maker instead of a patient.
