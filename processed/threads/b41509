5 Jecika performed a GK taming system treatment (keratin treatment) on me on 10/31/13. It has been 4 months and it is still going strong! Well worth it! I started with very long, frizzy, curly hair. She used the "resistant" level on me. I was expecting it to smell bad or burn my eyes, but it didn't! It actually had no smell. Jecika was very professional and we had a blast chatting during the process. My hair used to take 30-45 minutes to flat iron. It took 5 minutes the first 2 months and now takes 10. I look forward to future treatments with her. This treatment has been life changing!
5 If you are seeking out a professional to give you extensions, then do yourself a favor and book an appointment with Jecika at JKHair.  She did mine and was very precise and thorough.  Plus you can't beat the pricing she offers!  I get compliments on my hair all the time and people don't even know that I have extensions until I tell them my little secret :)  I know Jecika has many other talents with hair as well, so if you aren't looking for extensions, check out her list of services because she's awesome!
5 I got a partial foil treatment from Jecika and am very happy with how it turned out! I am a natural brunette who loves to be blonde, and after being VERY blonde for a very long time, I decided to be a darker blonde (picture Jennifer Aniston). She did exactly what I asked for and made it look completely natural, much more natural than my hair has looked in a long while. I'll be back for sure and hopefully one day I will be able to afford those amazing extensions she does!
