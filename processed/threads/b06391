5 Great group of doctors always willing to accommodate patients and at times can get you in without an appointment.
5 Generally if you call in the morning to make appointment... You can usually get in SAME DAY... Which is SUPER CONVENIENT.  Been coming here for YEARS.... And NEVER had any issues... Always seen Dr Dyer... And he had seen everyone in my family.... He's great!
1 The waiting area seats are stained and old... it gives you the creeps to sit down... their reception is rude and not happy to be there, and they waited until after my 79 year old mother's exam to tell her they do not accept Culinary insurance anymore then slapped a huge bill in her face. Find a better establishment for testing.
