5 I love coming to thinique medical weight loss center, the staff is so friendly.  I have started taking the skinny shots and I'm so in love with them, I have seen some weight lost but what I absolutely love is how much energy I have.
5 The staff is very friendly and helpful. Can't say enough about the Skinny Boost....jump started my New Year's resolution. Thank you!
5 I am so glad I discovered Thinique in Scottsdale.  I have tried the B6, B12 with MIC shots and while they are helpful and good for your energy and metabolism, Thinique's Skinny Boost Shots are a 10+ for effectively aiding in weight loss.  Skinny shots not only contain the B vitamins, but more of them that just receiving a B6, B12 regimen.  And they amazingly curb your appetite.  Their supplements are great as well, and the staff is so friendly and helpful.  5 Stars really isn't enough for Thinique. Cathy
5 I've always fluctuated with my weight and getting the skinny boost gives me more energy to work out and it pushed me to go further. I love it, the staff is extremely helpful and informative about the products and benefits. I go in for my monthly skinny boost!
5 Swim suit season is upon us.  So I stopped in Thinique North Scottsdale to see what kind of packages they might have.  All the ladies were very informative and the clinic is super clean!  I had a SkinnyBoost shot with vitamin B12 to help speed up my metabolism as well as give me some energy. I felt fabulous afterwards! If you are looking to shed a few extra pounds and need someone to help hold you accountable, then Thinique is the place to go.  They will work out a special diet and weight loss plan just for you.  Check them out.
3 I was so happy with Thinique when I started my program the first week of Nov 2013. Everything went very well until January 2014(estimated) when all the knowledgeable staff was let go by new owners.  Since then, I have struggled with the program and find it frustrating that staff have been extremely slow to get up to speed. Visits take longer, little positive reinforcement, so I stopped going and took a mindful break from the plan.  Am returning to the program and hoping for the best. Will update review if service has improved.
4 Am back on the program and happy with the service. Some new products and packages and friendly staff upgraded my prior review from 3 stars.   Would recommend to friends and family. Give them a try
5 I recently started my weight loss program. The front office was wonderful I think I only waited about 3 minutes until I went back to see my counselor. They made me feel comfortable.  The price was right.  I am excited to lose my baby fat!!
5 Update on my recent experience, I went back in for my skinny boost which I'm in love with, but this time I signed up for the health coach. This is my first time ever having a consultant to talk to about my weight loss journey.. but I feel so comfortable with the people who work there and I look forward to going in every month! :-)
