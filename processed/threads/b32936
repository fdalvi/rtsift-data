1 I got surgery with the core institute a few weeks ago and I feel as if they didn't give me any proper instructions what so ever. I have placed calls, being told I'll receive a call back, and the nurses have failed to call back. I do not recommend
1 Do not go! They will guide you the wrong way. Fck u up even worse and be discriminating against color and if you have a complaint. Rude. Disgusting staff.
1 If the Core Institute accepts appointments to see and physician but instead gives you a PA (that they call a doctor), go elsewhere. The difference in training is monumental. This is a practice that should stop immediately.
