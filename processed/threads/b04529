1 Rude & uninformed staff.   Sales girl did not know what an insurance appraisal was.
1 I stopped into Helzberg this past week while killing time before work. The first time I walked in I was there for about 5 minutes and was not greeted by a single staff member. Not even a nod or wave to acknowledge my presence. There were a couple of customers in the store so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and decided to return after I grabbed some lunch. Only because I spotted a nice watch. When I returned someone did help me right away but she was rude in the beginning.  She was conversing with her coworker on tasks they needed to complete. She didn't really take me seriously until she noticed I was  already wearing a Movado like herself. I narrowed my choices down to two watches but to my surprise a customer walked in to and interrupted our conversation to express her urgency to clean her ring.  The sales associate took the customer's ring and went to clean it and left me standing there. I walked out the store and will never return. I will find my watch elsewhere.
