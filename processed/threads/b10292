4 im definitely a fan, its a coupon book for 30 bucks last a ful year there are always high end buffets for half price so you easily make your money back on the buffet alone, there are some deals on hotels as well, have used it all over the city. if you are a vegas local i would say check it out
4 I went here to get my Las Vegas Advisor (LVA) Pocketbook of Value (POV). It includes 132 (this year) coupons and offers for places in and around Vegas. I stop in here 2 or 3 times a year for other various gaming books that are value priced from time to time. The selection of books and their price tag varies throughout the year. I snagged a great poker book for a few bucks on clearance that normally retails for around $25.  In my experience, the staff is always friendly and helpful. There is never a wait and they get you in and out quickly.
