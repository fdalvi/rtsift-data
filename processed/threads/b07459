4 You know, it's been years since I ate at Burger KIng. I loved this place when I was younger and I can say it certainly contributed to me being as big as a house. I loved their sausage croissants and whoppers, but as I grew older, the whoppers became smaller and of course, more expensive. I think the last time I ate at BK was in Madrid in 2003.  Anyway, with coupon in hand I sent the boy to pick up something to nosh on for lunch. I was incited however not by having a 2 for 1 coupon but on the new fries featured in their new commercial. Glad I did. The fries were great They are thicker which I love,  they were hot , maybe a little too much salt. That's it.   The Whopper was delicious and brought me back to my high school days in Passaic NJ where I could put down two of those bad boys. It was hot, fresh and a perfect blend of mayo, mustard and ketchup. As a double whopper is could have been wonderful, but the single was satisfying.   I guess I I have come full circle. I'll be back Mr. Burger King.
3 Not a bad one. You get what you pay for. The only thing really is the area.
3 The newley remodeled BK looks great, they lost the stuck in 1998 look. The negatives are the slow customer service, the stupid drink machine ( please bring back the fountains), and the fact that they no longer have cinni-minnis and have replaced them with cinni-bon rolls.
