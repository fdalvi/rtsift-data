5 DR Stacy is the best !! she has taken care of my sons teeth since he was a little boy, he is in the army now and she still takes care of him . she is taking care of my daughter now , and she sometimes requires a lot of patients when she is getting worked on . all of the staff do a great job !!! she has moved a few times and we have went right along with her to all the new locations.
1 Honestly, I feel that this practice gouges their customers....They gave me an estimate a week ago, but when I took my daughters in to have the work done, suddenly the bill was tripled of what the estimate that they gave me was...I understand a little more, but tripled!?!  I have NEVER paid so much before to have a couple of fillings done....$1,100.00 later...(and that is AFTER insurance paid their part) we will be returning to our old dentist.  And I don't know if it was just a coincidence, but they didn't tell me the bill was going to be tripled the estimate until AFTER they had already given my children the sedative, and so I said never mind, this is not what you estimated me, we will just leave, and they said they didn't want me to leave because they had already sedated my children, so I was stuck with going through with it and paying triple the price I was originally told.....  But I do have to say that they are good with kids. That's the only good thing I can say about my experience :(
1 DO NOT GO HERE. I went to her as a child for orthodontics and it was such a horrible experience that my dad made her remove them. Then 8 years later i've had to have another set of braces due to her poor treatment! DO NOT GO HERE!!!!
5 Highly Recommend Dr. Stacey!!  Diane Stacey, DDS has been taking care of my 5 children's  teeth their whole lives. They are all Teenagers now. My kids have the most Beautiful Smiles! My kids love going to the Dentist, thanks to Dr. Stacey and her Wonderful staff!  She is the BEST!!
