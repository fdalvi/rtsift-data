5 Breeze Landscaping enhanced our back yard in spring of 2008.  It turned out beautiful, just the way we wanted it, and completed in time for our guests to enjoy the outdoors on Easter Sunday.  The crew was courteous with great work ethics.  Recently we thought we had a major leak in the watering system; Jack Breeze came out to the house the day we called and, fortunately our leak turned out to be a simple matter of overwatering.  Jack reset all the timers and our problem went away.  Thanks, Jack, for your excellent service! Joe & Darlean Worischeck
1 Horrible, put in the plants and will not honor his plant guarantee fro dead plants Will tell you what you want to hear during the initial signing. Company was sold to Mike Dzinglewski and Jerry is no longer involved. stay away
5 These guys do good work.  They have good taste and perform great design work.  Be sure to look at pictures of the projects they have done or go to the houses that they've done.  We did have a few plants die (we had the work done in May) and they completely covered them under warranty without any hassles.  I'd use them again.
