5 I had amazing service at this urgent care. They found my insurance information even though I had lost my card and got me in right away. They were extremely nice and professional. They followed up with me after my appointment and then assisted me even more in getting proper treatment. I would highly recommend this urgent care facility.
4 I was excited to see an urgent care pop up closer to home than the one at 7th ave and Camelback. I hurt my neck about a month ago and with the pain increasingly impacting my daily function, I decided to drop in. This location is at 3rd ave and Thomas, south of the hospital. It is a new place and at 2:30 pm on a Monday was empty. I filled in some paperwork and was brought back quickly. The P.A. on staff thought my issue was whiplash but said they wanted to x rays to be sure. I was so happy they could do that on site and give me preliminary results that there wasn't anything serious going on. I was in and out in 35 minutes and got a few calls the next days making sure I was feeling better. I did get called at home, work, and cell phone which I thought was overkill. But overall, I was very happy with their service.
5 I visited Express Urgent Care today after slicing my hand open on a glass. They got me in immediately and I was taken care of very promptly. All of the staff that I dealt with were friendly and professional. I needed stitches and a tetanus shot and am very nervous about being stuck with needles. The staff did a great job at making me feel at ease, and I was on my way within an hour of walking through the door. Also, the prices with no insurance were very reasonable. I cannot recommend these folks any more highly.
3 Overall good experience. The wait wasn't bad and the staff was friendly and helpful. My man had to get his thumb stitched up and they didn't make him cry.  They would get 4 stars but they didn't have any magazines in the waiting room worth reading.
5 I have been to several urgent care facilities and this is one I will return too.  Not only are they clean but the staff was considerate, nice and helpful.
5 I may have found my new go to urgent care! Everybody here was nice and caring. I was in and out in probably less than 45min. I would recommend them to everybody!
5 I came here because of the great reviews. I can honestly tell you that the staff here are attentive and care. The first time I came here I waited only 10 minutes. Office staff are polite and treat you like a family member. The doctor was attentive and listened to what I had to say. I was iffy about coming, since I dont like medical offices. I enjoyed my visit here. I felt comfortable with the staff.
5 Best urgent care I've ever been to. Their staff is knowledgable, warm, and welcoming. Very efficient in their diagnosis and were able to get me in to a diagnostics center same day for CT scans. They took really good care of me and for that I am so grateful. Will definitely be back if needed and would recommend this place to anyone in need.
5 this place is awesome the waiting room is super quiet no annoying tv or music, they get to you super quick and the doctor listens to what you have going on overall it was a great experience.
