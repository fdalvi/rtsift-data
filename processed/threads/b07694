4 The men's team coach is one of the best around.  He is a strong coach and qualified to Judge Men's Gymnastics at the National level.  He can create strong gymnasts without the ranting that most gymnastics coaches do.  Not that he isn't tough because he is, but he has the right perspective and so while creating great gymnasts he has a happy team that wants to go to the gym so they can be with their coach.  Way to go.
4 Great place.... coaches are stern but likeable.  Not the best parking or room in viewing area but still great!
4 Great staff/coaches but the viewing area for the parents is horrible.. It is almost impossible to get a seat..it gets 2 crowded and most of the time you have to stand to watch, especially when your child is enrolled in a 2 hour class..
5 I have been taking my 5yr old son here for a year and we love it! He just signed up for a second class and now he goes twice a week.
5 My son is enrolled in coach Justin's class. Justin has great patience with the kids, and my son being the cautious child that he is really appreciates that. We love coach Justin and Miss Alexis, they have a great impact on my boys confidence. I also work at Phoenix Gymnastics Academy and as a teacher admire the skills that these two workers have with the kids. It's all about building confidence and the children having a good time while getting active!
