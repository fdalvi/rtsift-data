4 This radio station is awesome.  Best rock/classic rock radio station in the valley.   All DJs are excellent.    Check out Sludge and the crew for their morning show Monday thru Friday.
3 When I want to Rock-out I tune in to KDKB....it's hardcore rock baby!  When I head to the gym, I'll listen to this station to get me in that aggro-beast-mode.  They play all of the classics from my childhood to early 20's.  Metallica and Led Zeppelin get a lot of play on here and that's just fine by me.  Return Factor - 66.6%
