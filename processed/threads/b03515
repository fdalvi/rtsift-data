3 Kiddo had a homework assignment and needed to get some colored pens and printer paper.  Of course, he didn't tell us about it until the last minute....so, we had to scramble to find stuff.  Luckily, this store is nearby.  We found everything we needed and were in/out within a few minutes.  Return Factor - 75%
