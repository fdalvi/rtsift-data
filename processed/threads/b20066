4 Edinburgh does lots of things very well, but in general, nightclubs aren't really one of them. Shameless cheese and / or fawning the Cristal sipping fraternity are usually the order of the day, and while there are a few more thought-provoking nights and venues that do a turn, you'll often find decent stuff relegated to once-a-month events, or even sparser.  Berlin does a semi-acceptable job of imitating a house / techno club in the rather more bangin' city it's named after. As is with most clubs playing this kind of music, if you're not really into it, then it will all sound the same after about 15 minutes, but if it's you're thing, then this venue isn't bad at all. if a bit lacking in any discernable atmosphere.
