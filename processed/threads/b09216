5 I go there on occassion and they are always on top of their game. Great service, fast hot food, and reasonable prices.   Today I had a large terriyaki chicken bowl with veggies and it was yum.
5 Ronald M. You are so modest. He is here all the time! I suggest a list is made of the best of the best of Samurai Sam's, because this one is really "As good as it gets!" The beef is always cooked perfectly, and you don't feel ashamed to say dark meat (chicken) please! The veggies can be skipped, but they are only there for decoration anyways :)  This place is always clean and they always have a special offer going on to college students; they understand the times, and in return they get rewarded with good business.  5 stars because they survived even when places around them are closing.  :( Keep up the good work Samurai Sam's
