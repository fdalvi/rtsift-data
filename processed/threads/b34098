5 American Veteran Fencing built us a gate and did a wonderful job! We highly recommend them! The GM Johnny Carroll oversaw the job and we were very pleased with the outcome, besides the beautiful gate they were so clean!
3 I'm giving them 3 stars, but I'd prefer to give them a 2.5-- not because of the quality of the finished product (which was fine), but because of the unnecessary hassle. We hired this company because of the price and the recommendation from a reviewer somewhere that said Johnny would build it like his own.   I'd recommend them, but with the caveat that you're around to supervise and set and enforce strict guidelines.   After we blew a fuse, they used a neighbor's electricity without permission.  They also moved his possessions away from the fence without asking first.  They did, however, apologize, but it should not have happened in the first place. They also installed a few wrong color blocks in our fence, although they ended up replacing the entire section without an argument. Even though it would take multiple trips to do so, they also were not able to completely transport all of their materials off-property until the day after the fence was completed.    However, the finished product looks very nice, and they took the time to deal with sloppy work on the footing of an adjoining fence, which was much appreciated.
5 Johnny did a wonderful job!  Our fence looks beautiful and was exactly what we asked for.  We even had some trees that had to be removed to put in the fence and his crew were willing to cut and haul them for a fraction of the price other companies would have charged.  We love the end result.
5 We moved to a new property & they built a wall for us, with 2 gates. They were fast & did a terrific job!!! Highly recommend!
