4 Okay, so this isn't the best pizza you will ever eat, but you can't beat the five dollar dandy (as we call it) I'm from Michigan, which is where this chain (and dominoes) started and I can honestly say that the crazy bread here taste more like it originally did that a lot of the sleezers back in MI. For the money you just can't beat it. They have $5 large pepperoni and cheese only pizzas ready and waiting for you. We've been to this one a number of times and the pizzas are always good, never taste like they've been sitting forever. If you've never had a sleezers pizza before I'll tell you what they are like...the crust is on the thin side (and isn't the best cold, if you like the left overs definitely want to nuke it or put it in the oven) the cheese is good and the sauce has a nice unassuming flavor. Highly recommend some crazy bread to accompany your pizza. There is some nice garlic butter on it and cheese sprinkled on.....if you really adventurous go for the Italian cheese bread....it is quite a delight! So, go forth and have you five dollar dandy!!
4 Pretty good on a budget or to feed a brood. Often spot a sisterwife or sisterwife offspring here.
1 The sauce is terrible, zero flavor, dough is okay, toppings are not the best. As pizza goes, this is the bottom of the line.
1 This location had STRUGGLES! I always call my order in and it is never ready in time! Today I called it in at 8:05 pm. They said it would be 15 minutes. Showed up at 8:30 pm giving them plenty of time and THEY HADNT EVEN STARTED IT YET! Their sense of customer service, accuracy and urgency is very lacking! When you talk to anyone here they are very mono tone and robotic. C'mon guys let's get some personality!!
