2 I enjoy a good 9 West shoe.  They usually have a good mix of heel heights and basic colors, with one or two crazy ones thrown in for funsies.  This location did not melt my butter.  Apparently they only carry shoes for those of you who have been binding your feet, or have freakishly small feet.  It wasn't just that they didn't have my size, but they only had eensy weensy sizes.  I didn't even try on the shoes I already own and love in a different color, because they didn't have my size.  Le sigh.
4 Buy one pair get one half off.  And two pairs we did buy.  One pair for my Mom and one pair for me.    This place was jumping busy.  Lots of sales staff helping find sizes when needed.  I did have difficulty finding my size in stock but was pleasantly surprised when I found my size for a pair of multicolor peep toe heels that screamed my name.  Hello shoe addiction and hello new pair of shoes, welcome to my home, treat me well!
4 The service provided by the staff was excellent.  They were attentive and very helpful without being pushy.  The store was also very organized, and there was a buy one pair get 50% off a second pair.  My wife was very pleased with the deal, and she likes the brand a lot because the shoes last a long time.
