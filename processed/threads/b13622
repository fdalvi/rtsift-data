2 -Store sign falls on a customer with the Store Manager and his two giggling minions just a few feet away. They continue chatting and laughing. Very professional, huh?  -The incident is pointed out to the Store Manager and he shrugs it off. Why is this guy a Store Manager I wonder????  -During a previous visit, there was obvious tension between TWO MOD (manager on duty). I speculate that they think they are invisible or that customers don't notice this ongoing drama at this location.  -My point is that the store manager sets the tone to the store environment {ie - neat store, friendly employees, service, etc.} and this one needs a NEW Store Manager. There are many other grocery store choices, I wouldn't bother stopping here again regardless of the prices, location, etc.
5 I love the fact that I can pop in for grocery items and a few essentials and not have to go to the huge super center. Employees are always friendly, store us clean, and great parking!
3 Great little store with everything we needed! Check out was a little slow, but very well organized store overall.
2 Disappointing visit today... empty container of sani-wipes, opened & half drank gallon of milk in the freezer section (disgusting!)  Always clean, never busy, friendly staff.
