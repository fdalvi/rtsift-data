3 I stopped in here to find a supplement that the Muscle Max store next to Gold's didn't have. My husband likes Hi Health because he says it's cheaper than GNC.   I went in and found the employees to be very helpful and friendly (without being over-bearing). The store offers a buy one get the second half off for many things in the store, every day. Pretty cool. It wasn't valid on my supplement but was for the liquid vitamin I bought.   When I cashed out, the girl gave me some good tips on my supplement that I didn't know before, so I really appreciated that.
5 So much better than GNC.  Ok now that that's out of the way.   Basically Hi-Health is just loads better than GNC. Oh did I already say that?  Jillian was so nice and helpful when I told her I was looking for diet supplements. I had pictures on my phone of the specific brands and she helped me pick the best one. She is smart and friendly and was never condescending or judgmental.. Unlike GNC. Seriously I hate GNC.   When I picked my supplement, she also gave me some great advice on how to best support my regimen with vitamins.   Not only do they carry more than GNC, their prices were around $15-$20 CHEAPER! And their loyalty card is FREE. A lot of items were already discounted, but the regular priced ones can be purchased for buy one get the second half off with your loyalty card. Which is free. So awesome. And you get coupons for spending a certain amount of money.   Jillian didn't just give me a bunch of garbage that the reps told her to say, she showed me products that she actually uses on a daily basis and loves. There was also a male working at that time for you dudes who need... dudely advice.   Don't go to GNC, they suck. Go to Hi-Health!!
