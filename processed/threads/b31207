5 I love this spot for breakfast Everything borro for the win!
4 A co-worker and I were hungry last Thursday and decided to order from Lucy's. We were really happy about everything. We both ordered a breakfast burrito and we were satisfied with the food as well as the price .  We are going back to try the lunch soon!
3 Decent little lunch spot in an industrial area that doesn't have much else in the way of food, except for the old donuts at the circle k.  the salads are good and of a good portion.  they use boars head brand of lunch meats, which is one of the best quality of lunch meats out there in my opinion.  the coffee was okay. the staff was nice.  it had a nice open seating area both indoors and outdoors.
5 This place is awesome with friendly staff who greet you with a smile every single time you walk in. Lucy also seems to have remember every single persons name which is amazing! Lol. The food is yummy and has good deli meats from Boars Head! Nice little cafe with quick service for when you're in a hurry
