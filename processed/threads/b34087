5 Somehow, the Fashion Show Mall location didn't pop up when I tried to check-in, so I checked into this one. Oops. The Palazzo one is probably the one my boyfriend will be going to...  I bought a gift card for his birthday, for the royal shave treatment. The staff was very informative, knowledgeable, and friendly. They explained what the treatment came with and made me feel very comfortable.  I'm hoping it's a great idea. It's hard to buy gifts for boyfriends. Us girls are so easy! LOL
5 A great guilty pleasure while getting away from the hustle and bustle of Vegas. The barbers have always been top notch while letting you relax without talking your ear off. The sales staff are always helpful and never come across as pushy. Considering the price of most activities in Vegas, the reasonable price for an hour of relaxation at The Art Of Shaving is highly recommended.
1 I was so excited to get a shave I walked in & the lady working there did not even know I was there.when I asked about the shaves she didn't know anything & I made a appointment for Monday & the barber doesn't work on Monday so why make a appointment for me then?????
