4 This is another small thrift store, but they have a decent selection and great prices on books.  I was welcomed as soon as I walked in, which was very nice. They have special vintage items and do private auctions. I picked up a hard cover book of poetry by Robert Frost for only $1. I highly suggest it if you're looking for inexpensive books.
