5 The therapists here did a wonderful job with my neck injury after a car accident! Everyone is extremely nice and I got great results. They have a number of students working here and they all have enjoyable personalities although some of them do come across interpersonally as a bit "young". Nonetheless, they do great work in collaboration with the therapists and are knowledgeable and helpful! Thanks for great service, Foothills Sports Medicine!!!
4 This place is good. Friendly staff, nice owner, etc. The front desk people could be a little friendlier... 90% of the time they are too "busy" to say hello.
5 Foothills Sports Medicine Therapy is the best!  From the office staff to Vince Kame to the helpers, everyone is efficient, caring, and very personal.  As an amputee with a double fracture in my upper arm, I arrived in a difficult situation.  After three months of therapy, I have about 98% use of my arm again.  I am able to do everything I need to do and most of what I want to do.  I highly recommend this physical therapy facility to anyone needing help to get well.
