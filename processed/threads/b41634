4 This is a meat store with a little cafe inside! Wonderful Menudo on Saturday & Sunday and great steak rancheros.  They have specials everyday! Staff was very friendly!! We will be back!!
5 Came here for some carne asada & it turned out magnificent on the grill!  Will return for any future meat needs.
5 Have been looking for a good carne asada in the valley and I have found it! When I ordered up a couple of pounds, the gentleman explained he doesn't marinate the meat until you order it so you don't get overcharged with the weight of the marinade. Plus you only need to marinade it for 30-40 mins. So I took him on his word and mannnn, they guy knows what he is doing. The meat was nice and lean, very flavorful after 30 mins marinating. Defiantly my spot for the carne q!
