5 I switched over to Mike because my old agent was impossible to get in touch with. Mike answers his phone 7 days a week and gives me great service. He went over my policy in detail and I was able to get more coverage for less money than I was paying in the first place!! I so all my insurance with him. His staff is also great! I highly recommend Mike to everyone.
5 Mike has been my insurance agent for the last 10 years.  Mike handles my home, auto and commercial policies.  Mike reviews my policy and suggest ways to increase my coverage and lower my rates.  Mike and his staff is great and always on top of everything.
5 Mike and his team are honest and he even answers his phone after-hours. He guides you to areas of coverage that he has personally for his vehicles and home. Mike is honest and never tries to force a policy. Customer service is his number one priority. I have passed Mike's name to many people and never once a complaint.
5 mike has handled my auto, home and commerical policies for the last 12 years.  He is very helpful and always has my best interest in mind.
5 Mike and his office staff have been a real benefit to me in finding a competitive commercial auto policy at a great price.  In addition when I needed E&O coverage he gave me a referral to another company as he was unable to provide as competitive a quote.  I would highly recommend Mike for any of your insurance needs.
