2 This is where I have to come pick up my package when they leave a yellow slip at my residence. I don't like this one- it's packed- the line is out the door, every time I have to come here. I don't understand why this one is the one I have to go to- it's still in the same zip code, I suppose. It's just past Fremont/Boulder near a mobile home community. There are three people at the desk, but the line seems to move so slow. The last time I went, someone in line had really bad BO. Sometimes someone asks if you're there to pick up (yellow slips).
2 So glad technology is making it easier to avoid having to come to this place. On most of my visits, line wait times have been long. The place is small and cramped. Half the employees are friendly, while the other half are creepy characters. Speaking of creepy.. the area is one to stay away from. I always feel if I dropped my mail in their outside bins that some shifty junkie would come by and and try to steal from or damage them. Then how would Santa know what to get me for Christmas?!   I understand it's one of the oldest post offices in town, and I love places with history, but something tells me the history of this place isn't too glamorous.
1 Awful place my house has the same number as the other house in the next block and the mail man puts 2 out of 3 packages at the other house and when i go to this post office and ask about the package they say he left it in my mail box wat a load of crap!!!! I cant even rely on getting my bills!
