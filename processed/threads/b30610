5 This is the best smoke shop that I have been to in Phoenix. Mostly because the staff that they have working here are down to earth, very friendly and helpful. They have excellent prices on their merchandise, and sometimes they will even take off a few dollars from your purchase or just give you a great deal.
5 MF Legit.  I didn't know how good they were to me, until I moved from Avondale to N. Phx. They hook up deals, and take care of you if you are a reg.  HINT: Plan an extra 5 minutes into your trip, they love to shoot the breeze. Everyone's chill here.
5 Nick was super nice and helpful.  called ahead of time to find out if they carried e-juice and he hooked me up ... amazing prices.  told him the kinds I like and he is going to get more in the shop to try out.  nice, clean store too!  thanks for all your help Nick!
5 Best smoke shop in the west (valley). Quality products, super-friendly staff, and excellent prices. I'm always satisfied every time I visit these guys. They make you feel comfortable and willingly give you the best deal. We're lucky to have such a nice smoke shop out here like Traders!
