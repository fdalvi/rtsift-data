4 They put more meat on than most stores
4 Best Subway on this side of town.  Everyone speaks English too which helps.  The only annoying thing is it seems like they are always training someone on the cash register which slows things down a lot when there's only two employees working. They make my sandwich quicker than they check me out sometimes so for that they lose one star.
5 Always fresh and easy. Going to try eating subway for a whole month hopefully I can lose some weight. I love the turkey sandwich here.
4 Solid subway.  Good service!
1 Do not try the flatizzas.  They are horrible!!  I wouldn't feed these to my dog!!  Not able to give them 0 stars or I would!!
4 Very friendly service..went out of their way to make my order. Gave me a free drink for my inconvience.
