5 Michelle Daly is a pro when it comes to floral staging and design. Her excitable energetic personality is sure to get you more excited about your wedding if you already aren't.  Even your husband will enjoy selecting flowers with you when Michelle takes you on a journey of design in floral elegance as to what your special day can be. Even those with small budgets can get masterpiece work from Michele and her team of elegance makers.   Even though my experience is with her wedding work, she's a pro at party, business function design, corporate offices, and just about anything where you want floral sophistication and an eye for   staging using nature's beauty.   I give five stars for this up and coming artsy studio of design and ideas using botanicals and skill.
5 Kurt is right on with his review. She does a great job! I totally recommend Daly Flower Affair.
5 I used Daly Flower Affair for this Valentine's Day, and it was great!  My wife loved it.   PROS: Great location, relaxed atmosphere, and fair prices.  The owner, Michelle Daly, is very well versed in all things botanical.   CONS: I had no idea of Michelle's qualifications until I started asking about her background.  I'm not one who enjoys braggers, but she is way too modest and should let the world know more about how much she really knows about plants and flowers.  I have only used Daly Flower Affair for Valentine's Day, but I know I won't be getting flowers from anywhere else.
