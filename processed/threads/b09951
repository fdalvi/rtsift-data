2 Just raised their tuition....out of my budget. Not happy.
1 Stay away from this school and their PhD programs. You will never graduate. It's like hitting a moving target.
5 I was lucky enough to attend the 2014 graduation at the Orpheum Theatre this year. Everyone was so excited and you could tell the staff, faculty, and everyone associated with the university genuinely cared for the graduates. This might be an "only online" university, but I can definitely tell it's not typical in any sense of that definition. They really do care for the students.
