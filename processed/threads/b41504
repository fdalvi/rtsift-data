5 Christine is super friendly, honest about the process, and professional. Her laser is the latest technology and it didn't hurt. I had lasers before but it was hot and i had to put on a lot of aloe after. This one was not the same. I did underarms, upperlip, lower legs, and brazillian. At sensitive parts it's a little snappy which is understandable but other parts didnt hurt. I'm scheduled to go in again at the end of may. I will be updating my reviews then!
5 Christine is amazing! Super professional and knowledgable. Very willing to explain the process and answer any questions. Also, you only deal with her so she knows you and knows what you need.  I have never had a laser treatment and was a little scared that it would hurt.  It's much less painful(and damaging) than waxing,  and after a few treatments you're done forever!  Her prices are unheard of and her laser is the best of the the best. You can't get a better lady or a better laser in Tempe!
5 I'm so excited about finding Laser by Christine!!  I've seen her 3 times now and I'm ecstatic with my results.  I was hesitant for awhile because I'm a baby when it comes to "asking" for pain.  I asked about a few areas and was happy that Christine was honest about what areas don't feel so good and what areas are a piece of cake.  I've added a new area each visit because I'm so impressed with the results.  I'm doing underarms, top of feet and legs... these are all piece of cake areas. LOL   I would highly recommend her and agree with the other reviews.  She is super friendly (I think she just about knows my life story now,) she is honest, professional and I think her pricing is very fair.
