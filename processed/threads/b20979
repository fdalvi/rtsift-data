2 In the past if you wanted to track down a specialist record you had to beg, borrow or steal to get your hands on it, but now you'll most likely find any item of music recorded somewhere on the internet.  This shop appears to have forgotten this fact and still offers the rarer CDs and records at high prices and in today's market it doesn't stand a chance.  The owner is very helpful and knowledgeable so despite the fact the stacks of boxes make general browsing impossible, if there is something you are after it can be found here.  However, for the rarer CDs you're looking to pay on the wrong side of Â£10 with no negotiation on price.  Simply put, the internet has made this shop redundant.
