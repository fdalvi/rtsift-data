5 I dont' like to go to banks.  I prefer direct deposit and getting cash when I checkout at the grocery or at Circle K or the like.  I've had to go inside this location a couple times.    Both times, I was approached by an employee who asked what I needed to do, who then sat me at a "banker's desk", where they took care of my transactions, without standing in line.  Nice!
5 I have only gone inside a couple times, but WOW on the customer service!  Chase is the best bank I have ever used, and I've probably had accounts at half a dozen over the years.  Everything is stellar, especially at this location.
5 I love this bank! Great ATM, never any problems. And whenever I have to go inside, the customer service is outstanding. When I started a new direct deposit Melissa from this branch called me to see how my new job was going! Wow!
1 What can I say, I HATE Chase.  They care about no one but themselves.  I only stopped as this is the bank that the account is based from.  Since I have no choice in this matter I use Chase, but for my personal banking, I'll stay as far away from Chase as I can.
4 Great banking location.  Area lighting was a huge plus because you won't fear for your life of being robbed.  It's across the street from Paradise Valley Mall.  Multiple lanes of drive-thru windows and ATM's.
