5 Over the past few years I have wrestled with lower back pain and nagging headaches, so a friend of mine referred me to visit Dr. Johnson at recovery chiropractic.  Previously, I thought that all chiropractors are virtually the same, but Ive never been able to get as much movement and improvement in my problem areas as Dr. Johnson has been able to get.    The atmosphere in the office is upbeat and positive.  The staff on hand is always able to fit me in when I need them to.  Once I went to visit Dr. Johnson one, I wont go anywhere else.
5 I am so happy to see Ben in his new office.  He is so knowledgable and can read the body like no other chiropractor I've been to.  He's amazing! My husband and I highly recommend Ben!
5 Just had my first massage here. Lanae is a fabulous massage therapist and can really work those stubborn knots out! I will definitely be seeing her again very soon! I didn't  have a chiropractic adjustment with Dr. Johnson, but had the opportunity to speak with him. I really like his individualized approach to his practice. He was very welcoming and did not pressure any sales on me. I will definitely recommend Recovery Chiropractic!
