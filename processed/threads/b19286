3 The staff is friendly and easy to get along with. The seating, strangely enough, does not seem particularly enticing. The coffee, in contrast to the southern Waterloo Starbucks, is quite decent.  My favourite thing about this location is that, during exams, they keep themselves open for twenty-four hours. While I wish that they did this all year round, that they do even this much is a rather wonderful touch.
4 I remember when there was no Starbucks at this location.  And now it seems so long ago, and this store such a fixture in the environment around it, that maybe it was always here.  Like the other Starbucks near Waterloo City Centre, this Starbucks is rarely devoid of patrons; it's a busy place and there is often a line-up.  And there are many folks (students and non-students alike, it seems) with notebook computers open, are taking advantage of the free Wireless Internet that is provided.  Otherwise, it's Starbucks, with friendly service, tasty beverages (including my wintertime favourite, the Salted Carmel Hot Chocolate, which I enjoy) and a cozy environment waiting for you.
4 Has a some chairs out front so you can socialize under the hot summer sun. The employees are exceptionally friendly, particularly in the early hours of the morning when I typically grab a drink. Expect it to be moderately busy due to the location.
