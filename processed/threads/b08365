5 Awesome honest people. Jiffy Lube ruined my air conditioning in the middle of summer. These guys helped me out. Great prices. Thanx Jiffy Lube. You made me find a great new location to get my oil changes at.
5 We have been going to Arnold's Auto Center for 10 years for our oil changes and maintenance.  They are honest and reliable and I highly recommend them.
1 This has to do with the Body Shop my insurance company sent me there. I was pleased with the way I was treated . I got my quote and went and checked out a couple of other places that told me they were not going to do it right because of the paint chipping close to where it was it the car need to be stripped to the metal because it they just sanded it and painted the paint would crack after a year . When it came down to cashing out they sent my insurance company a totally different estimate which gave me less money. So if you take you car there for an insurance estimate don't cash out because you will get less money than what was quoted
