5 Was sitting at Starbucks drinking coffee, when I saw this place. My iPhone 5 had a broken screen for about 3 month now. When I saw this place next to Starbucks I decided to finally repair the iPhone. By the time it took me to order my coffee and come back they already fixed my iPhone. That was super fast!! David was very cool and easy to deal with. Also picked up a case for a great price! Highly recommend.
5 Unfortunately my toddler decided to throw my iPhone 5S into a sink full of water. It was completely submerged for at least 5-10 minutes. I truly thought it was probably done for good, but I decided to give this place a shot since it recently opened down the street from my house. The guy who helped me was friendly, knowledgable, & kept me updated each step of the way. He was really upfront about the costs which were reasonable in my opinion. He was able to run it through a special machine that they have that gets the phone really dry which seemed to solve the issue. Apparently they specialize in water damage. So I am a happy customer with an iPhone 5S that works just fine again & it didn't make too bad of a dent in my wallet either! ;-) I highly recommend you bring your iPad, iPhone, etc. here for repairs.
5 A perfect service experience! Super-fast turn around, clear communication (expectations), flawless repair, and very good pricing.  Phoenix iPhone Repairs took my shattered iPad and actually turned it into a pleasant experience.  Thank you.
