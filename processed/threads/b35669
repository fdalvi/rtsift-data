4 I am a fan of Glendale Sports Massage.  I stopped by one day because I was randomly driving by, and made an appointment with Eagle for the next week.  It was great!  My chronic back pain and knots in my muscles were relieved, and I felt like a new person by the time I left.  The facility is very new and very clean and organized.  I would recommend this place to my friends.
5 I use Glendale Sports for personal training and I must say Eagle is the best personal trainer in The West Valley his program is extremely effctive and customized to my exact needs. If you are looking for a professional and results... this place is a must.
5 I had plantar fasciatis and tarsal tunnel release surgery that was not very successful. Eagle is a miracle worker. I never thought I could take a step without pain. Eagle is not a foo-foo type massage with candles. It is hard core and he is the real deal! Way better than FAST and more knowledgeable.
