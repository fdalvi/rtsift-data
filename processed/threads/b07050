4 I've been a member of this gym for a couple years now and I think it's great. For the record, I only go to the gym for classes - I don't use exercise equipment, lift weights, or play raquetball. Once in a very long while, I'll get myself into the pool.  My opinion is that their classes are wonderful. The ones I want to take (Zumba and Kickboxing) are offered right after work. They offer a lot of BodyPump too - if that's your thing. All the instructors are super nice and enthusiastic. The locker rooms are always clean and tidy.  The pool is small - three lanes, not quite 25 yards and shallow. But it's fine for swimming laps, you just have to do the distance calculation appropriately.  Parking is usually good in the warmer months. Gets to be a little bit of a pain in the winter, but that's probably true of all gyms in Wisconsin.
5 5 stars for the quality of trainers at this gym. Unpretentious, laid-back, friendly members and staff. I've been a member at other gyms in town and this one is easy to get in and get out. Most classes are free and the teachers seem motivated in and out of the gym. Yes, the building is older as one reviewer put it, but the membership price is really reasonable and it's clean. They seem to keep up with the latest classes (Zumba, etc.) The sauna and hot tub are separate for men and women. The trainers are willing to help if you need it. The pool can be a little chilly at times.
