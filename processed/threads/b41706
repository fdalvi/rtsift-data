1 No one loves Sonic more than I do and I was filled with utter excitement when I found out they were putting one in right by my work. Service seemed pretty nice until I noticed a hair in my tots. She said were pretty clean here and just gave me a blank stare. I didn't think asking for a new order of tots was a big issue but apparently it was to her. As I was eating my new order of tots my friend noticed another hair on one right before I put it in my mouth. Seriously?! Hair in two different orders of tots?! Well done Sonic! Your customer service is exquisite!
2 I am very glad there is a sonic finally close to my home. I really just like to come here for the beverages. Why is the service so slow every single time I come?
5 I love this place!!! I leave here happy every time!!! Love bringing my little sister here to get lunch because they are so fast even during the busy times of day...usually lunch  and when the high school gets out. The employees are beyond friendly and willing to help me with whatever it is! One employee even helped me carry my order to my car because I didn't have enough hands! They go above and beyond the expectations of "good" customer service!!
