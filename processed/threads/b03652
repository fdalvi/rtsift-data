5 An amazing section of light bulbs for just about anything you need. Most are in stock, reasonably priced and ready to take home. I have brought in several odd bulbs that I needed to have replaced with no markings on them - They always come through like champs.   Take my advice and covert your old bulbs to LED - Well worth the cost for me just to not have to replace burnt out bulbs all the time - some of my lighting is very hard to get to and Halogens are so damn hot!
1 Arrogant & incompetent!  Sold me the wrong bulbs. Then, when I comeback to exchange, they kept me standing at the counter while three guys sat with their feet on a desk laughing and telling stories.  I asked to be helped several times and was told to "Wait!".  WOW!
5 A big shout-out to Travis for helping take the headache out of replacing the lighting in our latest project!  All of the folks working at the counter are helpful, friendly, & knowledgeable. I couldn't even get impatient with the customer in front of me who kept asking additional questions, because to be honest I wanted to stay all day and talk about lighting, too!  A great consumer experience all around.  At a time I had almost run out of hope finding a specialty bulb, this place came to my rescue!
5 Awesome and interesting! Knowledgable staff, great pricing, huge availability.  Lowest prices contractor grade level LED lamps in the valley.
