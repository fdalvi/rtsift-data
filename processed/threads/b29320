4 This coffee shop is super busy inside of the Borders book store at Town Square. With free WiFi provided by A nationwide cellular provider, there are always throngs of people here drinking coffee, reading books and mags plus enjoying the scene. It seems that there are a lot of travelers here and not locals. This coffee shop offers a few snacks but nothing you could have for a substantial lunch.
4 My all time favorite @SBC is 'Raspberry Mocha Kiss' - A Classic Mocha with the addition of raspberry.  Plus, they never forget to give you a piece of dark chocolate stick on the side :)  It can be a little too sweet for some people, but as long as you don't drink everyday,, why not having one?? Honestly, I don't want to count how many calories in my coffee or latte :)  I'm pretty sure that if my friends are reading my review, she or he will say " the wrong choice of coffee can easily sabotage your weight loss plans, J. Don't forget that...!"  Oh well, it is time to drink some Warm Winter Beverages that they are offering this year!  I know that these holiday coffee drinks are somewhat overpriced but they are so delicious! SBC's Holiday Coffee Drinks: *Sugar & Spice Latte( brown sugar, cinnamon, & clove flavors ) *The Peppermint Mocha Trio  *Gingerbread Latte   I spoiled myself with Gingerbread Latte this time.  It came with a Gingerbread Man Cookie and a whip!  Oh my heaven, it was the all the winter sweetness I've been craving for a while :)   **pic included***
4 Always A perfect brew. I came in for a classic mocha. I think it was one of the best that I have ever had. It's so simple but so delicious. It wasn't burnt. It wasn't over killed with whip. Your friendly workers were patient with me as I haven't been to a SBC in quite some time. Sometimes the drinks are too sweet. Sometimes they aren't warm enough. This one was perfect. Thanks!!!
