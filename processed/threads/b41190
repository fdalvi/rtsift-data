5 = = = = = =  WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET!  = = = = = =  This mid-sized Peter Piper was JUMPING this morning & they had an amazing 13 pizzas out when I arrived, plus bread sticks!  I did go ahead & order up a custom, this time with Thin Crust, Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Red Onion, bacon & Jalepe√±o.  Then it was off to scoop up & enjoy some of each of their 3 tossed salads.  Before long my pizza was up & was it ever good!!  (Photo)  After wolfing down half of that one I couldn't resist grabbing slices of a couple different chef's choice pizzas which were really good too...  loaded up great with such things as triple cheese plus several other toppings.  YUM!     :-))  Weekday Lunch Buffet:  $5.99/$5.39 Sr.
5 My kids love this place. Great for large groups. Pizza tastes good also. Kids love the arcade area. Reasonable price for what you get.
