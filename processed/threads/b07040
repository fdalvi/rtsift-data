2 My burger looked like someone sat on it. Hot mess y'all.
5 The food is hot and cheap, the nutritional information is easily available, and the waiting time for the food is very brief. I've never had any trouble in the multiple times I've eaten here or used the drive through. I also have a personal preference for their spiced chicken dishes over other similar chains.
4 I've been happy with this location for the last year. I figured it was due for a quick review.  Most of the time, I use the drive thru. You get in and out pretty quick and service is usually very good. Food is normally made and put together well.  (Unlike other fast food restaurants that throw it all together in paper.)
