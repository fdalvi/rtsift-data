4 This Scotmid is shiny and new after recently being refurbished. It has a much better lay out, and shock horror some staff to work behind the tills! Which means if there is one person in front of you in the queue, the nice check out boy will buzz for someone else to come and everyone moves along quickly and quietly.   Note to security guard. I know it is Gorgie so everyone is a suspect, but do you really need to follow me around every time I come in? Especially as you see me make my purchases every time I come in!
4 A fresh and bright branch of the much loved Scotmid, you can stock up on groceries here, buy some classic Blossom Hill, get the latest magazine or just get some snacks if you're feeling a little peckish.  As far as corner shops go, Scotmid's are great and they always have a great selection of goodies to choose from.   Clean, well organised and well stocked, I really can't complain.
4 The Scotmid, is my little local corner shop as it were, despite being a bit larger than that but it is pretty awesome and the Sainsbury's round the corner could take note!  It's local, it has all major food groups and the prices aren't bad. From emergency milk supplies to being tempted by the chocolate offers, the Scotmid caters for locals really well. The baking section is particularly good and there can be great offers on wines too now that it is part of the Co-op group.   Not so good for gluten free but I can live with that. The store itself is clean and well organised (though the milk move a few weeks ago still confuses me) and staff are friendly and helpful.   How can Sainsbury's learn from the little Scotmid - the queues! I often go to the Scotmid instead of Sainsbury's as there is always bloody queues at Sains Murrayfield and after a hard day at work, I just want to head in, grab supplies and go home. The Scotmid staff are really good at checking who is where and getting tills manned when needed - perfect!
