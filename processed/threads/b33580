5 I purchased a Groupon for Escential Massage and wow, I'm glad I did.  It was 60 minutes of pure bliss.  The atmosphere was so relaxing, the masseuse was very skilled, and the lotion she used wasn't too oily or scented.  And the sheets on the massage table were incredible!  I left there in a daze I was so relaxed.  It may be a bit more pricey than other places in Madison, but it is worth every single penny.  I ended up booking another appointment in a month and I'm already looking forward to it.
4 Four stars for the massage - my only wish is that the hot stones would have been a little more prominent in the massage. Other than that, it was amazing. The massage table was super comfortable, warm, and very relaxing atmosphere. I left feeling wonderful! If it were cheaper, I would schedule one every month.  Two stars for actually trying to book my appointment. It took several calls and messages before I was finally able to get in touch with anyone. I think they need a full time receptionist to answer the phones!
5 I have been to several places in Madison for massage and this place is the best!  The atmosphere, music and therapists are professional and top notch.  The massage table is always so comfy and just the right temp.  My most recent massage with Julia left me feeling as I had taken a nap.  Look no further, its worth the $, drive or whatever!
4 Other than it's discrete location, and booking an appointment, the massage was great. I purchased the 75 minute warm bamboo fusion massage which was undoubtedly relaxing.  The ambiance was great with aromatherapy to help me relax, which usually takes me a while.  The massage table did get a little warm but you can request to have it turned down.  I recommend 75 minutes or more to fully enjoy the benefits of this massage.
