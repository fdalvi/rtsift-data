4 It used to be a bank branch and has a drive -thru window :-)  I love the egg-white/turkey sausage sandwich on flatbread. And the coffee is pretty good too. the service is very quick. Haven't had any donuts.. yet.
5 I like this Dunkin Donuts. The employees are always polite and nice even in the wee early hours when they are most probably wanting to be in bed asleep. They have speedy service and I don't think you can beat their prices for actual good coffee unlike that other "big coffee chain".
5 I go here daily for coffee and the employees are super friendly! Had a stranger buy my coffee once and one employee actually remembers how I take my coffee! Blueberry cake donuts aren't too bad either!
