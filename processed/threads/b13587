5 Great Friendly Service.  They replace my front window and gave me a glass piece for my china hutch at not cost :-)
5 I own a window cleaning company, Clearly Professional Window Cleaning (you can find my business here on Yelp), and a number of my clients have used Lizard Heights Glass and been very satisfied. Installing glass is much more involved/technical than it used to be. I highly recommend Lizard Heights Glass. They know their stuff, and they're just nice folks!
5 Exceeded my expectations. We called and they came out the very next day, then delivered and installed sooner than promised. Very friendly and professional.
5 Finally - a PROFESSIONALLY- run glass company. From answering the phone to work done - completely professional. Prompt.  Job well done.  Fair prices. I highly recommend this company.
5 I had a windshield i needed replaced, they where quick and worked around my crazy schedule.  Their awesome, friendly, great service, and very professional.  I would recommend them to anyone.
