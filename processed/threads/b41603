5 Very good! I'm a pretty picky eater when it comes to food and this place was up to my standards. I got the chicken breast and beef kabob(comes w rice/grilled veg and salad)  a side of hummus and chicken noodle soup. The meat was really good and clean, (I hate when I get those gross weird UFO pieces of whatever)... Defiantly all just perfectly delicious juicy clean meat! The place is really clean to. My dog was in the car so I had to take the order to go but I will definitely come back again when I'm in the area to dine in. :)
5 First and forest, the layout of the resturant is very nice and clean. In essance, there is plenty of chairs and tables to conform to any size of party with just enough decorations to mold the upbeat atmospohore of the resturant. Additionally, the staff is extremely friendly with nothing but a sincere attitude and smile on their faces. Besides the great layout and friendly staff the food itself is what will have me coming back for more ! We ordered a gyro in pita with french fries. Normally, I'm very picky when it comes to what  I eat; normally I don't deviate from anything that isn't a hamburger.  However, the gyro was absolutely delicious.
5 Decided to check out this place.  Not disappointed.  Hummus was excellent. Ordered a combo of chicken and  beef. Tender and not over cooked.  The rice was fluffy and tasty.  The chef came by and brought me a taste of his homemade baklava. I'll be back!
3 Really was anxious to try it.  I really like good Persian kabob. It was very clean inside and the food appearance was 5 stars but I really didn't find the taste to be the same as other Persian restaurants. It wasn't bad, just didn't taste as good as it looked.  I will return and try it again. Would like to see musto-mucir (yogurt dip with shallots) on the menu.
5 Like this place a lot very friendly and courteous staff. The lady in the front provided us great service and food quality was excellent. The aushak and beef sultani where excellent!
5 I've been pleasantly surprised by the quality of Mediterranean food in Vegas, but this place is something special. Food was fresh and tasted great! I highly recommend checking this place out.
1 I did not like this restaurant at all and would not recommend it to anyone!    I love Persian and Mediterranean food, and I really wanted to like this place.  I live very close and I was excited when I saw they were opening.  So I decided to stop in and order something simple - the Gyro in Pita .  For nearly $7, I assumed it would be fantastic!    I couldn't have been more wrong.    The meat was VERY dried out and there was very little sauce to make up for the extreme dryness.  It was also cold, as if they made it that afternoon for someone else, rather than made to order that evening for me. The flavor was bland, and the meat wasn't seasoned at all.  It tasted like a beef jerky sandwich with no flavor.   But the worst part was the fact that I had to wait for 40 minutes for that disgusting meal!  I walked in and ordered it and I sat there in their empty dining area for 40 minutes!  The young cashier was courteous, and apologetic, but it didn't make up for the fact that I could have gone ANYWHERE else and gotten a better sandwich for a fraction of the cost and time.  I would assume that wait would account for the cold meat, but I sat there asking every 10 minutes, and the cashier assured me they were "still working on" my order.   What a waste of time, money and space.  I will not be visiting there again if they can't even get a gyro right, nor will I be recommending it to anyone, ever.   Save your money and time and go somewhere else.
5 This is now our favorite Mediterranean spot in town. (close second is Kabob House)  I recommend the Beef Kabobs, they are super flavorful and tender.  Garlic yogurt sauce and the Chutney are nice along side.  Looking forward to trying some more items on the menu.
2 I wanted to like this place so bad, it's large inside and lots of comfy seeting, very nice people working.  I got the ground chicken kabobs and had a side of hummus and eggplant, and got some desserts.  I got take out and at first it smelled yummy, but as I got home I realized it also smelled salty.  Usually I can't tell food is salty just from smelling it. When I ate it, that confirmed my fear. Yummy flavor, but so much salt competing with it that it made my tummy hurt.  They would be five stars if they cut the salt in half. Also one of their desserts I got smelled like rancid oil. The others didn't, but just the square shaped reddish one.
5 Amazing service and incredible food. These people care about your dining experience and they have the food to back it up. Do yourself a favor, just go. You won't regret it.
5 I was stopping for gas en route to the rental car return at McCarron, saw the Kabob Factory as I was turning in, and figured that an early dinner would be the perfect antidote to airline pretzels and peanuts.  I was their first for dinner that night, and it felt like I was treated as a sheikh.  I ordered the lamb kebob plate ($15); a basket of sliced flatbread and an INSANELY delicious mint sauce for dipping was brought as an appetizer.  If you're a chili head, this is for you; if you're a garlic head, this is for you.  I ordered the entree with a side of eggplant; the entree was brought to me with a heaping pile of saffron-infused basmati rice and superbly tender, seasoned lamb.  Equally delectable was the eggplant, served casserole-style with a topping of yogurt sauce and parsley.  Finished it off with a small dessert of a gulab jamun- inspired sweet dumpling- the perfect topper. I have to imagine Kebob Factory is a neighborhood favorite near the airport- I hope they maintain a steady business, for the locals' sake.
5 Kabob Factory is fantastic! From the outside it doesn't look like the most inviting place, but once you get in you will be happily surprised. The decor is very nice, but the food is even better. The chicken breast Kabob is wonderful, along with the hummus, baba ganoush, pita bread and the falafels. Everything is just so great and the people are very kind. I go to this restaurant at least once a week, if not more. I would (and have) suggest Kabob Factory to my friends and family. They all love it also!
5 Excellent Shami Kabob and Lamb Kabob! The eggplant side dish was delicious! I would definitely come back even though I live way across the other side of town.
5 We have eaten here many times and It is great!  The outside is not as Inviting as it can be. BUT the food is outstanding! ! It does take  few minutes to prepare the food..it is so fresh! The hummus and the rice are the best. The baba gnoush and fallalle are good too! The Waiters are friendly and helpful. They could put something on the outside to make it look more inviting!
4 Loved it! Headed to the airport and wanted a good meal beforehand.  The atmosphere is a little drab, but who cares when the food is this good.  Wanted to start with the baba gnoush but they were out.  I'll take that as a sign that they make everything fresh.  Ordered the grape leaves instead. Not bad but not great.  They were too oily and the rice inside was a little mushy, no biggie. I ordered the lamb liver kabob and my boyfriend ordered the gyro sandwich.  While we were waiting for our entrees we were brought a basket of warm, fresh pita bread and some kind of deliciously amazing green dip. I think the pita might be homemade,  it was that good.  And the dip was garlicky and lemony and so freaking good. Our server told us that we could take it home by the jar full. I wish I could have! We got our entrees and they were both delicious. The lamb liver was a little dry but I would rather have it a little over cooked than under cooked. Know what I'm sayin'? It was crispy and caramelized on the outside and the rice was perfect and the side of salad and chickpeas were a perfect compliment to the whole meal. My boyfriend's sandwich was badass also. Tender, flavorful meat and the same fresh pita bread and really good tzatziki sauce. Even the french fries were good. The service was top notch. The owner even gave us a plate of baklava at the end. Ive never had chocolate baklava before and im glad I got to try it. All around this was a great meal and I wish this place was in colorado instead of Vegas.
5 Love the food especially lamb kabob and chapli kabob,staff was extremely friendly and the place was clean..Everything was fresh and the quantity was generous.Will definitely go again.
5 I was wary of this place since the outside leaves much to be desired, and when we walked in there wasn't anybody else there (on a Saturday night, no less). However, the cashier was very friendly, helpful, and willing to work around our special dietary needs. I'm not sure what happened on the days some of the other reviewers waited a long time for food because we got our food within like 10 minutes (and we ordered the Royal Sultini Kabob, which has three different types of kabob). All of the food was really great. The eggplant that comes with the kabobs and the chutney are fantastic. I recommend the Shami kabob. Overall a great place and I'd definitely go again.
