5 Have you ever walked into a tanning salon only to be "greeted" by some snotty little teenager who thinks she's God's gift to earth?  That is an experience you will not have to endure here!  The girl sitting behind the desk was super friendly and knowledgeable which made me feel welcome and happy to be there.  She gave me a tour of all the different beds they offered and made sure that I knew what the differences were and what features they had.  The plans that they have are a lot less expensive than the other tanning salons I've been to around here and the beds are some of the best I've seen.  I can't believe I finally found a tanning salon that I can afford to go to where the beds are awesome and the people there are nice to me!
5 Feel very comfortable here. All the girls are super nice, and aren't stuck up like most of the girls working at a tanning salon.   I just bought a couple sessions to use while I'm out in Maricopa for a short time period, and every time I go they make me feel as If I have been going there for months. Every time I come all the girls make sure I have what I need, very accommodating.
5 Great place and Jennifer was very helpful and knowledgeable! Very clean and priced reasonable compared to Chandler sites so Copa can compete with the bigger cities and is close to home.
