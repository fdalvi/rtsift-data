3 My mom and I went here for the first time yesterday. She got tips put on and I opted for a manicure because I don't like the way fakes make my nails look after they are off. The guy doing my nails had major sniffles and I asked him if his allergies were bothering him and he looked relieved that I understood why he was making so much noise. A few of my nails are filed uneven but I am the only one that will notice. When he was cutting my cuticles he really went to town, I have a few gashes the day after that are sore. I received a quick but very nice hand massage, and after washing he told me to sit in another chair so a different woman could do my polish.   She literally SLATHERED on the color. I picked a pale, pale pink and you could tell on the first coat where the lines were. I figured it would look better after the second coat but again, she put SO MUCH on that my nails were drowning. Anyone who knows the basics of nail polish can tell you too much polish means air bubbles not to mention taking forever and a year to set and harden. She was also very sloppy near my cuticles and I will have to go back and clean them up myself. I would of asked her to redo them but unless I had someone else I know it wouldn't have made a difference. Plus it was $11 so I figured I paid for the hand massage and cut job. My mother's nails came out nice, I don't particularly care for white tips but hers looked decent.   I took a menu home and they charge $45 for a spa pedicure. Somehow I have a feeling it wouldn't feel like a $45 pedicure.
4 This is not my usual place, but when in town it's the only nail salon I will go to. I can always walk in and get service. Everyone is friendly and I love that they use OPI products. For a pedi with scrub I only paid $27 + tip. It's cheap and definitely worth it!
5 I've been to a few of the many nail salons in Maricopa and Enke Nails & Spa is the best! The staff is friendly and the quality of the service and product is high!
