1 terrible waist of money and time!!! not a "real" school just a way for some institute to make money!!! they should be illegal! do not go here!!!!!!
1 I went to this "school" in 2007-2008 and I knew more than the teacher.  This place is a RIPOFF.  Super expensive and it's not worth the time or money.  To teach at this place, all you need is a certificate and one year of experience.    I took the Medical Assisting course... At every step, there was drama.  First of all, the students - GHETTO!!!!!    The fist teacher took points off of my grade for my monroe piercing but didn't take points off of another girl who had a nose ring.  WTF???  And when I asked about it, the teacher said it was none of my business.  My second teacher (front office) had no control over the class, couldn't answer basic questions and who knows when her last "hands-on" training was.  She's old and her experience seems out dated.  The third teacher (back office) REALLY had no f-ing clue what was going on... she was more caught up in the drama between the girls in the class than teaching.  She bruised more than one student while teaching blood draws/ injections.    This school is unfair, disorganized and a complete waste of time.    PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE.  YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.
1 This is a horrible "school." I went to interview for a class, was told point blank they don't accept everyone for the program, only 28 out of 200 applicants make it into the class. Then they had the nerve to tell me I'd have to completely shave off my beard and hide my tattoo with a band aid because they don't consider either to be professional. The tour is a total joke, the admissions rep kept dropping how much all the equipment e.g. the mannequins for EMT class cost ($13,400). Seriously? Then how much a the new parking cost, and how they want new awnings but are so expensive. Needless to say I won't be going to Pima.
