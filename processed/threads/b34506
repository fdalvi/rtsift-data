5 This office is hands down the best dentist we have ever been to! Anyone considering using this office should not hesitate, you won't be disappointed!! My only complaint is that they don't do adult dental work because I would bring my whole family in for care!! :)  My first experience with this office was after my 11 year old son had a biking accident. The hospital he was taken to recommended this office. From the minute we walked in they were welcoming and helpful. They made my son feel comfortable and talked him through each step of the exam, they provided me with options for payment as well as options for care.   It was obvious that the care of my son was the most important thing to them. The work he performed was not only top notch but innovative and the follow-up was amazing. Each member of the staff is genuine and goes above and beyond to make sure the patient has a postive experience.
5 Just awesome. My not quite two year old daughter had her first dentist appointemnt and the staff here was great. They were friendly to my wife and I in the waiting room and my daughter had a blast on the toys. The Dr. was very friendly and made my daughter feel very comfortable prior to doing any work in her mouth. Very helpful for us to know how to better care for her teeth at home. Awesome experience for something that both my wife and I were very worried about.
5 I adore this office! Great fun, friendly atmosphere with a lovely staff! I took my Lo here after chipped part of her front tooth we were able to get into see the dentist right away, we just love him! - Great Thanks To Amazing Kidz
