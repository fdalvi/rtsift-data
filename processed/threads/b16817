5 Can't say enough good things about Joel and this business! He answered all of my questions and my diamond ring never left my sight!  He was extremely courteous and friendly.. He even let me look through his high power microscope to see into my diamond. I felt very comfortable with him and will definitely return for all future appraisals!
5 This review is for the. Jewelry judge, Joel Lackey located at :   8425 W. Flamingo Rd. #5                      Las Vegas, Nevada 89147                      phone: 702-275-6204  I've been a customer of Joel Lackey since I moved to Las Vegas. I purchase gems from all over the world.  I'm not a gemologist, I hope to be one someday. If I have a question that I need answered, I can always rely on Joel's expertise and honesty. He is very knowledgeable.  My first impression of Joel was he truly enjoys his work.  He inspected and determined what types of gems I brought in. He was also able to tell me if they were earth mined or lab created. Joel is an expert with all precious stones, diamonds and metals. There are only a few "real" gemologists in Las Vegas Joel is definitely the best at his craft not only in Las Vegas but the West Coast as well.
5 Went with my girlfriend to get her diamond earrings appraised. Facility was modern, clean and professional. Joel was a pleasure to deal with and 2nd to none with his professionalism.
5 One of my co-workers had a really pleasant experience here and recommended this place to me.   Joel was nice, informative, and professional. I left feeling much more knowledgeable about the jewelry industry. I felt that I received a fair price for my ring. I will definitely be coming back in the future!
