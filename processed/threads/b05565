2 I don't like how this Taco Bell location is setup at all. It's the only shop that's not attached to the rest of the plaza. If you use the drive thru, you're forced to drive back out onto Charleston and head East, so I usually end up having to drive around in a couple circles every time I come here because I normally go to Taco Bell and Office Depot. The service is fast and the food is decent, but it doesn't make up for the inconvenience. If this weren't the closest Taco Bell to the CSN campus, I would never come here.
4 All I need to say is It's taco bell. Quick, affordable and delicious.
1 Crappy service. Major cross contamination. Inattentive staff. Do yourself a favor and go someplace else.
