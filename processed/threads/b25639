3 I can never find anything at this GAP. Except this time cargo shorts for my trip. Is it me or we Phoenicians will never dress like the models here.  Real nice but over clothed in my opinion.  Also they seem to be a lot different from most GAPs I've been been to....hmmm is it really GAP or an imitator.... enjoy!
4 40% off all clearance at times - yes please.  The store was well stocked with a kids and baby Gap connected - SCORE.  The staff friendly but not  over bearing.  Isaais helped us check out and was super nice and friendly my kids and I.  He even gave us a free movie coupon for the Harkins.  This will be my Gap now!
4 Great service and friendly staff.  If you can't find whatever you are looking for, ask an employee there for help.  If they don't have anything in stock at this location, they will try to find what you want at another location for you.
3 3.5 stars if I could...  I've always been a fan of the Gap, and I like that there is one in Tempe Marketplace even if it is on the smaller side. Having Gap Kids next door is a plus. I have been in this location a handful of times and never once has it blown me away. Staff is semi-friendly but fairly non existent. Store is relatively clean although I'm pretty sure it wasn't swept today (HUGE dust bunnies. HUGE!). Displays are pretty well stocked, mannequins are dressed (I hate when they are not), prices seem to be accurate. There is a Fall Sale going on right now where the whole store is up to 50% off, probably a push to make room for the first set of Holiday apparel that is due to come out soon.
