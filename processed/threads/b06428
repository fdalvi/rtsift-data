4 fast & friendly. just in & out, no lines, no hassles
2 Every time I come to this branch there are only 2 tellers and 20 people in line. But they have 10 teller windows. Can  you guys get more help? This is ridiculous!!!
1 15 people in line and only one bank teller working? Been standing here for 15 minutes and only one person has been helped so far. Get your act together BofA! Wtf!
5 Jose, Naira, and Kiyanna are always so welcoming.  Naira remembers me buying my house all the way back in 2010 and asked how it was and Jose was quickly to say hi how are you!  I only frequent the bank once a monthly maybe and for them to remember was pretty surprising and appreciated.
4 The staff was friendly and helpful, and we were there a few times in a day.  Good customer service.  :-)
2 Even if you're looking for this location, you're likely to drive past it several times before you really see it. There's only one sign, and the building seems to just blend in to the surroundings. It's a nondescript gray and looks like it may be vacant when there aren't any cars in front of it.  Don't pull in to the first spaces you see, because the actual entrance is around the side of the building. Exterior ATM is conveniently located. Drive Thru has several lanes and 2 or 3 ATMs as well.  Staff inside are a little slow. Clientele here are a little ridiculous. Witnessed today two customers who didn't speak English walking up to tellers who didn't speak Spanish. Frustration ensued as the manager eventually came out to help them, and DID speak Spanish. Apparently the Spanish-speaking customers felt that they should have been immediately assisted by the translator, nevermind the fact that this is America and that employee isn't a teller. Normally I wouldn't pay too much attention, but these two customers literally started a screaming match about it and ultimately held up the line to the point that my simple withdrawal took over 10 minutes.
