5 Tired of the "Retail Chain Box" eye stores I vowed to try something new.   Crystal Optical was  terrific.  The optometrist was an older gentleman who has been in the business his whole life, it is his profession.  He is an expert and it shows.    He exam'd me and fitted me for replacement contacts quickly and efficiently.    I have a special concern about depth perception which we discussed and agreed that we should optomize my prescription based on my concerns.    I highly recommend Crystal Optical. Perhaps there are cheaper places, but that wasn't what I was looking for.  I am also sure there are better selections of glasses, but all I wanted was a REALLY good exam and checkout for contacts.
5 Reasonably priced. Excellent customer service. Timely appointments.
5 I have gone to Crystal Optical for over twenty years. The man who owns it always goes out of his way to give amazing service.  When my kids were young, I was on the sidelines at a soccer game one time and heard the lady behind me talking about how she loved going there because he would always tried so hard to make it easy for her kids....giving a loaner pair of glasses to her son until his were ready, etc. Three other people chimed in with great experiences they had had there. That's how I've always felt.  Personal service is sometimes hard to find these days, but you'll still find it here.
