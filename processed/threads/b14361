3 Goodwill is goodwill ... not much else to say. The crew taking donations is quick and efficient. The selection inside the store is ... shall we say ... eclectic. Although I found an excellent pair of sunglasses for $2 and keep looking for a $100 Dutch oven on sale for $5 (haven't found that yet). Good place with good people.
3 Maybe not the best Goodwill pricewise, I think it is one of the higher priced ones but I definitely found several items to buy.  At least it was the half price Saturday so everything I got was 50% off.  I bought several shirts for my grandchildren which was the main reason I was there and found a few things I'll probably try to sell on eBay. I'd go back to this one on the half price days but probably skip it at full price.  I keep wondering, why do they let the kids make a mess, especially in the toy area? Don't they worry about someone getting hurt, or being sued if a child or anyone else gets hurt, or if a pregnant or disabled or elderly person trips over the stuff laying all over the store? I know it is the irresponsible customers who make the messes or allow their children to, but it is the store's responsibility to provide a safe environment to move around in.  I've seen employees walk right past children making messes you can't even roll your cart thru and not blink an eye.  And surely when the toy sets get ripped apart and pieces lost, and others get broken, they must lose the money they could have gotten when the sets were complete and the items were less dirty or broken.
