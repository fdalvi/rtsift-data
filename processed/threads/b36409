5 Brelby is a new theatre company in the west valley that is opening in hopes of providing a new theatrical venue to local artists.  They're a company that promotes the growth of an artist in a realm that you might not have tried before.  It is a place that I look forward to seeing grow and expand to be place the entire valley knows to go for amazing theatre experiences.
5 A friendly and intimate community theater full of fun, great talent and wonderful staff.  Nestled in the heart of downtown Glendale's antique district this theater is a hidden gem waiting to be discovered.  Ticket prices are very reasonable. Bring the whole family and friends.  Have a meal and drinks at any one of the close by restaurants and have a fantastic and affordable evening.
4 A gem of a theater located in downtown Glendale. The creative cast and production crew put on imaginative shows from Shakespeare to world premire independent productions.
