5 Maren has an amazing bed side manner. She's so easy to work with , partly to do with the fact that she actually listens to her clients.   Maren is up to date with all the latest hair trends and can ROCK a serious braid !
5 Maren was amazing, hands down the absolute best in town!! I would recommend her to anyone who wants to look fabulous! I had an up-do done for a formal event and I was receiving compliments all night long and the next day after sleeping on it. :)   She asked me to bring a couple of photos in and she was able to take the pieces I liked most in each and created a masterpiece! Along with her talent in hair she was a blast talking to and I really enjoyed my time. I live in AZ now but would drive to Vegas for her to do my hair.   HIGHLY RECOMMEND! You will not be disappointed!
5 Love Maren!   Super sweet, knowledgeable and with a good listening ear, She can explain the technicalities of why your head shape should have bangs or what style will work with the way your hair grows.  I always leave feeling happy and refreshed!  My boyfriend goes to her now too.
5 Maren is hands down the best stylist I have ever had simply because she is able to listen to what her client wants and make her own professional suggestions. Anytime I want to do something different to my hair, she always explains it to me in a way that I can understand. I absolutely trust her 100% with any big hair decision I make. I highly recommend Maren to anyone looking for a caring and talented hair stylist.
5 I went to Maren for the first time the other day based off of the reviews I read. She is awesome!! My hair was so dead and gross and she made it beautiful again. She is very skilled and professional. I have been floating from person to person, never finding one I really liked. I have now found her!!
