5 Excellent staff. Always knows how to make my drinks. Always remembers my orders every time I come in too.
5 Great location and speedy drive thru!
5 This is the best starbucks I've been to, and trust me I have been to a few. The drive thru here gets pretty busy so you gotta hope that you get lucky and catch it when its quiet. The workers here have always been friendly and they crank the orders out pretty fast. I like to get my breakfast sandwhich and a drink in the mornings. I wish this place was 24 hours so I could come by after my late night workouts.
2 The slowest Starbucks. Ever.
3 Clean but staff isn't very friendly. I started writing this post last week and still have the same feedback after my visit today. Great location, clean however the staff is slow and not friendly to customers.   Disappointing to say the least!
1 Not a good experience. Left my iced coffee in the counter without calling my name. Messed up my order. Too busy with their LOUD conversation about wanting to leave early!! No wonder this place is always empty!!
5 I've had awesome service at this location. Everyone there has always been very accommodating.
1 Always slow. The cream is always empty. Believe it or not, they have run out of Pike more than a few times! How does a coffee place run out of coffee? I drive an extra 3 miles to avoid this place.
