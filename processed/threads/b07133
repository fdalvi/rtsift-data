5 I hate going to the dentist. Abhor it. But after 4+ years of avoiding going, it was time to bite the bullet.  Glad I ended up at Maple Grove Dental. Instead of taking shortcuts with painful equipment, my hygienist cleaned by teeth gently by hand. The dentist himself was extremely nice and gentle.  If I had known going to the dentist could be this painless, I would have gone years ago.
5 I've you've been remiss in visits or flossing, MG Dental does not shame you. Instead, they encourage to make better habits.  Great for kids, too. They encouraged me to bring my daughter in to watch my appointment so it would be so strange when she was ready for her first appointment.   The hygienist I see, Stacey, is always great.
5 great, patient centered dental care!  Straightforward and practical, comfortable and professional with no over the top 'office features'.  I really appreciate their patience, flexibility and willingness to provide great care.
