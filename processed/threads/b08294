2 I am a general contractor and have had dealings with many tile/flooring companies in San Diego and the metro Phx area.  I went to Imperial after hearing an ad on the radio.  I wanted tile for a bathroom I am remodeling in my own home.  After 2 visits I landed on a 12x24 silver vein cut travertine.  I was told it was in CA (no surprise all tile comes from the Long Beach ports).  I was told more than once thatthey get 2-3 trucks a week from CA and that I would have my tile in 2 maybe 3 days.  Well, I am on day 13 now.  Multiple calls from me, none from them.  I have heard some lame excuses so far and was told Weds it would be finally be here Fri, then Fri that they needed to log it in Sat and now Sat that it was not on the truck.  Well, just refund my 100% payment already and I will go somewhere else.  Thanks for a wasted 2 weeks.
5 Yeah E Yeah, Imperial Wholesale hooked me up with some wood flooring.  They have another location on 43rd Ave and Indian school and I wasn't too impressed with that one but I'm so glad I made the trek out to this location because I found the exact wood I was looking for and it was on sale!
