1 Went to pick up pizzas one night and walked in to an employee shoving cheese into his mouth...with his bare hands. It was disgusting and he knew he was caught. Contacted corporate and the manager and no response. Terrible service and disgusting atmosphere. Go else where.
5 I thought this Papa Johns had great service and the pizza was excellent.
4 The cheeseburger pizza was good.  I'm not a fan of pickles and the pizza is pickle overkill.  Chicken bites for $6.99 sucked and you're better off ordering a small pizza for that price!  Pizza was hot and came out quickly.  Service was ok.  Other than the girl who "was off" For the night-  she was yelling at everyone in the back while she waited for her pizza.  Very unprofessional.  I've never worked at a pizza place so I'm not sure if this is the typical work environment.  Or maybe it was her daisy dukes and horrible muffin top staring at me and my daughter as we waited.  ;) gross.  I mentioned this because my little girl said something about it.
5 I had a birthday party planned for my daughter's 17th birthday and scheduled a future delivery for the afternoon. Due to some computer glitch the ticket printed and they delivered the pizzas 3 hours early. Made a quick phone call to the store to report the error and they were kind enough to fix everything and deliver fresh pizzas at my originally scheduled time. I've used this location several times and the customer service always had been top notch, and this time was no different. Thank you guys for taking such good care of us.
