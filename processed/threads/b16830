4 This is the first time I've been here and it was a great experience! As you can see in the photo it is big, it actually set up in a warehouse.  It's a great place if there is inclimate weather or I it's late and you have no where to practice (it's open till 10).  So there are cages for baseball and softball; also there are cages to practice pitching, catching and just about anything that revolves around baseball and softball.  I would definitely recommend this place!
3 A couple of friends and I were running all over town trying to practice for softball tournament at the end of November and we were SCRAMBLING all over the Centennial area looking for baseball fields to practice! Driving from field to field, calling each other only to hear that another field is occupied... hmph! WHERE ARE WE GOING TO GO?!  My girlfriend was in the backseat and she used yelp* (woohoo!) to find Bat-R-Up Indoor Batting cages and called them.  She asked whoever she spoke with what time they closed and their rates. Judging from the tone of my girlfriend's voice, they weren't rude to her, so we checked it out.  Decent batting cages, but nothing out of the ordinary. We were greeted with a big group of female softball players and kids practicing. We were told 7:30pm would be the time we start and we got to start right away. Slow pitch softball for an hour got real tiring. We stayed until we got hungry.  I'm kind of blah about the place, but hey! It's batting cages. I didn't expect too much except for the customer service. The guy behind the register didn't look like he cared too much about what went on in there unless someone broke something. Pretty straight forward, but I'd probably come back if I was in the area and wanted to swing away for a little bit.
3 I had a tourney coming up, so needed to get some swings in. I went to this batting cage since it was the closest to my home. This place was average. If you're looking to stay out of the sun this place is great... On my visit I only saw a couple of machines for baseball and only one for slow pitch.  If you plan on a using the slow pitch cage, you will have to pick up all the balls you hit.
