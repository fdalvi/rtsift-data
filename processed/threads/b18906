5 This place always makes me happy. Way better than any BofA or Wells Fargo ever made me feel. They actually get to know you and I have only been with them for 8 mos. I think I can safely say that I will never put my money in a bigger type bank ever again! The only thing that I havent been happy with here was their Auto Center but you can still go to any car dealer and get a loan thru them so I solved my problem. If your still banking at Chase or Wamu I highly suggest a switch you'll never be happier.
1 be warned!!!   from my experience if you bank with arizona federal you are opening yourself up to losing your money, potential identity theft, and many days full of frustration while you "become one of them".    * outdated technology- hard to find information on their website and limited self service capabilities * contacting a live person will take up to 5 minutes! * fees applied incorrectly and excessively by arizona federal * problems can only occur from monday - saturday 9 am to 3pm * criminals welcome to take all the customer's money in the evenings and during the weekends * rude customer service agents that do not respect "members" * "be one of us" brainwashing slogan should really say, "if you are stupid, rude, and like other people stealing your money and being blamed for it, then join arizona federal and "be one of us!"
3 The Short: An AFCU location that's conveniently located, for some of us, outside the 101 beltway.   The Pros: - Friendly customer service. - Decent car-loan rates.  - Organized and modern interior.  - Ability to do same-day replacements for stolen or lost debt cards.  - Tons of sister branches.  The Cons: - Never has enough people staffed during busy hours. - Ofen has too many people staffed when slow. Why? - Charges account fees.  - Not enough AFCU locations.   Interesting Fact: I'd give them four stars if they'd do a better job of scheduling.
