5 After moving from Chicago last summer (in the middle the dust storms) and living in a house that faces east and west, it was critical that I find a good window cleaner.  I contracted 1st Glass to clean twice a month.  Since August I have been able to count on Justin to make sure all my windows (and there are lots of them) are clean and streak free.    If you need a window cleaner, this is the company you should try.  You won't be disappointed.
5 Justin was just out today to clean my home windows and screens.  Wow, what a difference!   Justin is prompt, efficient and true to his word on how amazed i would be on the "like new" appearance my sun screens would look!  I would not hesitate to call upon him again or recommend his service.  Thanks Justin!
5 Justin with 1st Glass Window Cleaners, LLC cleaned our office windows for our ribbon cutting and they were beautiful.  You don't realize how filthy your windows are until they are cleaned.  Justin was very professional, thorough and polite, I would recommend him to ANYONE!
