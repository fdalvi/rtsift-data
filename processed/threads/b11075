5 I needed a snack for the long flight to the Baltimore Washington metro area.  Have to say they have the best nuts I've ever eaten (almonds, cashews and walnuts).  Crispy, fresh and perfectly seasoned. The woman working the counter was nice and courteous.
4 Got some tasty popcorn for the flight home. Love that they have a healthier option of snacks. Fruit and trail mix, nuts, simple food. Love it
5 Well what can I say this fruit likes some nuts! Haha ok ok I'll stop! Awesome selection and nice change to the normal airport munchies. I'll be stopping back through on the way home for more!
5 I'm on a limited diet and the airport is not the best place to be for that. Lucky for me I stumbled upon this little gem where I was able to stock up on some dried mango and peach on the cheap! A new fave!
4 Great nut variety, glad I have stopped. Every time im in vegas and have a greasy food + heat - kills me every time. Nuts keep not hungry and full of energy - easpecially nuts from Vegas!!!
