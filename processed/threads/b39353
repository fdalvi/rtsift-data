5 When you enter White Dove Thrift Shoppe, it's easy to forget you are in a thrift store!  From the friendly greeting by a Hospice of the Valley volunteer as you enter, to the tastefully displayed merchandise, you are hooked!  The store's items are top-notch quality, no stains & smells here folks.  The store is clean, and smells clean too.  The mostly volunteer staff, as well as the managers are very friendly and outgoing.  I always leave feeling happy I went.  But this is where the fun begins:  THE PRICES ARE GREAT!  There are always several sales going on with certain color tag clothing going for anywhere from $0.25 to $1.00.  If you like to read, like I do, their book prices can't be beat.  I think the highest is $.1.50 for hardback books.  Even if the items you want aren't on sale, you will be amazed at the prices for such beautiful things.   I am in this store at least 3 days a week.  And their merchandise sells so fast that the turnaround is amazing.  Every time I go in there are new treasures!    Take a look!  If you love thrift store shopping, it doesn't get any better than this!!!
5 I've prolly been to every thrift store in town dozens of times, I go almost every day. This is one of my favorites. Whoever is sorting donations here has a "picker's" eye. Great prices and proceeds go to a great cause.   Daily special and small store pricing makes this better than the corporate, overpriced, big guys (Savers & Goodwill I'm looking at you)  But it's the selection that sets it apart. If you are looking for hand selected vintage items at sub antique store prices, and enjoy the hunt,  this is your place.
5 Definitely the cleanest neatly organized thrift shop I've ever been too. Everything is organized nicely, a very easy shop. Found some awesome home items at a great deal!! I will be back.
