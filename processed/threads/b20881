3 The Write Stuff is a petite but very comprehensive stationary stockist. It sells a good number of Post-It's, envelopes and small office equipment, but also has a number of pretty notebooks worth perusing. Card shop worthy, they would make nice little gifts for special occasions, or even sketch books!  The shop assistants are very friendly and keen to help but being fairly small in size and self explanatory, you should be fine. With a bit more than what you get in local post offices, the Write Stuff will keep you sorted for emergency stationary situations.
3 With a quirky name this place sells all the basic stationary you may require and it's great if you are in the area and are in dire need of a post-it (you never know).  I was in the area with a friend and his car and we stopped off so he could get some notebooks for his afternoon class. Don't expect anything too particular but the prices are reasonable and it covers the basics stationary-wise.
3 The only reason I went into this shop was due to its slightly humorous name! Yes, it does not take a lot for me to venture into any new shop!   Inside, the shop is pretty small but very well stocked for all your stationary needs! I wasn't out to buy any pens but I somehow I ended up buying some, but they were not that expensive, actually they were on the cheap side.   The staff were friendly and quite chatty which adds to what is already I think I pretty good stationary shop!   This shop has everything you need to fill up your pencil case and you will then certainly be writing with the write stuff!
