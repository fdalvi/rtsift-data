5 Went to a bachelor party in Vegas and the main event on Saturday was...  Wait for it...  A SEGWAY TOUR OF VEGAS!  Despite our crew of 10 Asian males looking completely nerdy riding the Segways around Las Vegas, it was really fun.  Since we had a crew of 10, we got a discounted rate of $70, which is really affordable.   The tour lasted nearly 3 hours as we went around The Strip.  I'd definitely recommend this tour to anyone looking for a day activity in Vegas and those who always wanted to try out a Segway.  P.S. Make sure you stretch out before and after
5 Holy Cow this tour is awesome! Segway Bob is so knowledgable about Vegas. He took us to the coolest places. This is a must do if you go to Vegas.
5 What a ride! Looking for something to do one morning in Vegas, we considered Hoover dam, zip lines, dune buggies, and then the idea of a Segway tour came up. We met up with "Segway Bob" on Freemont St. and he took us all over town. After a great 90min tour to numerous places around the old strip he turned us loose for 30min on our own. It was a Blast!
5 What a Blast Having visited Las Vegas at least 30 times before I thought I knew it all and had seen it all, but in a 2+ hour tour with Segwaybob I ( my wife & I) learned more about Vegas and the Strip than from all the previous visits. First- Segways are incredibly simple to learn to ride ( say  3-5 minutes ) even for me a 65 year old fart. Second- Bob is one of the nicest guys you will ever encounter Third - you will learn more about the town, the casino's , the history, the people, the legends.  Bob is a rolling Wikipedia when it comes to Sin City. Fourth- Bob is a Gastronomical genius who directed us to his favorite places from the best deals to the plain best places to eat.  Of course we enjoyed this after the tour Fifth- you will cruise around the strip easily and see the good-bad-and ugly in fun mode with a great safety conscious guide  My wife and I both commented this was so much more than had we spent the time at the tables A great adventure and totally exceeded our expectations.  Super fun even for Seniors.
5 If you're heading to Vegas you MUST go on a Segway tour!  There are a lot of other reviews here testifying to how fun it is to ride a Segway, how easy it is to learn how, and the great places you'll discover. I myself took the downtown 2-hour tour and it was worth every penny. From beginning to end the staff of Segway Las Vegas was super helpful; but they went out of their way to accommodate a sudden change of plans on my part and fit me in for a special tour so I wouldn't miss it. The day way gorgeous, there was no wind and I have a new list of things to do and sights to see next time I visit Las Vegas. Who knew there were so many things to see and do that are NOT part of the Strip? Thanks for the awesome morning, Segway Las Vegas!
2 Wouldn't recommend this company for a Segway tour. They appeared to be rushed, not very knowledgeable of downtown and the areas that were toured were uninteresting.
