4 The best thing by far about the Lutheran Thrift Shop is that they always seem to have the most adorable bags, purses, and clutches.   While their vintage clothing and shoe selection is fun as well, I have always had the best luck with adorable little vintage clutches.  The women who work there (mostly little old ladies-adorably so) are accommodating without being overbearing.  Especially while you're picking out jewelry in the front (they have a lot of fantastic old jewelry as well).  The Lutheran Thrift Shop has a wide selection-including some furniture and household items-without being so big that it becomes junky.  The prices are right for the second hand finds.  Lastly, it must be said, that it is clean.  I can't stand a messy second hand/vintage/thrift store.
2 Lutheran thrift was supposed to pick up a couch from me yesterday. Never called & never showed up. It was so much fun moving that heavy couch outside yesterday morning that they never picked up. Yep. FUN. Pffft.
4 I am tempted to low star this place only because I'd rather have it all to myself. The staff is made up of elderly volunteers who are not excited when you pay with a card, but they are super sweet to little kids. They recently expanded and I am digging all the vintage furniture. Since they've moved and expanded they seem to be getting too big for their britches and overcharging on the furniture. They send out monthly newsletters with coupons, so that eases the sting some.  Don't expect to pay with a card unless you spend more than $5 or so. It doesn't sound hard, but trust me, there are times where you can find some cute little things are a few bucks.
5 I go here all the time and I love it The staff are all volunteers so sometimes you may have to cut them some slack Sometimes their prices are a bit much but usually I can find a great deal
