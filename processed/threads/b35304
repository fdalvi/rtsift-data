4 Couldn't believe that my favorite Subway wasn't on Yelp! This location has been open for over 2 years now. Oh well it is on here now let the check ins begin. It used to be better because it was connected to Josie's frozen yogurt but they closed up shop. anyways cool thing about this subway is they have some regular seating but also have 1 table that has two leather chairs. very comfortable and a nice change from the norm of most subway's.
5 This is my favorite Subway! They hire the best people with great attitudes. There's never a dull moment when I go there! And the food is good, of course.
4 This subway gives military discounts!
1 This used to be my favorite subway until the two last visits. There is a white guy with spikey brownish black hair who is extremely rude. Him and another coworker (female) were, I kid you not, throwing food at each other. The guy went into the back with his GLOVES ON messed around with stuff came back out and proceeded to make sandwiches with those same gloves. I've never felt so uncomfortable and grossed out. Going to the Maryland location from now on.
