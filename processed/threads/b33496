4 Always looking for good independent breakfast places and have been to LSW four or five time and last weekend was the best breakfast we have had there. They did mention they hired a new chef and it shows.  Typical breakfast menu and weekend specials, great portions and everything cooked to order.
5 I've been going to Sunday breakfast with friends for a while now and was tired of the chain restaurants. Wanted to venture to the west side and found the reviews of this place on Yelp. Thought I'd check it out. Had to do a double take as I didn't realize the restaurant was actually in the Glendale Municipal Airport. I was a little apprehensive at first. When I first walked in, it was pretty crowded but still had tables open to fit my group. They had a breakfast buffet spread which they have on Saturday and Sunday for under $10 ($7.99) and it was great. My favorite was the gravy for their biscuits and gravy. It was thick but not too thick and had chunks of sausage in it. The buffet had a great assortment - scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage patties, country potatoes, pancakes, french toast, fresh fruit,  something they currently call "Ronnie's surprise" (they haven't picked a name for it yet) and the biscuits and gravy. Great variety and the food kept coming out fresh. Server was knew but extremely friendly and helpful. Will definitely come back and maybe even get some more friends to come along. It was worth the drive.
