5 Ok, so, I just had to write a review for these guys at Discount. I needed to get my tires rotated and balanced before a road trip so I called the nearest Discount to my work so I could go, take a long lunch and get it done. I call them just to see if they could fit me in and I speak with Jack...no problem, come right in, we will have you in and out in no time. (yeah sure, that's what they all say...) Well, to my surprise, I had AMAZING customer service. I walked in, the guy at the desk greeted me... I asked for Jack and he doesn't hesitate and calls for Jack. In the meantime, 2 other guys came in finishing orders and BOTH asked if I needed help. Nope...I am all good. Jack comes out of the office, I find out he is the manager. He is super nice and courteous. He walks me to my car, does a quick inspection...tells me to have a seat inside. I was there less than an hour and it was done. They pulled my car around and I was done. Back to work I go! Also, last but definitely not least...this place was immaculate clean for a tire place. Seriously, i would expect greasy finger prints everywhere...nothing. Shiny floors, clean windows...sparkly.
4 pretty good, i was in and out super fast, got a reasonable deal on my tires, exceptional customer service, they walked me outside to look at my car together, came back in, ran a few different options through the computer with me, decided on what i wanted.  they were super friendly and clean.
4 Great service, but always busy, especially on the weekends.  Best to have a ride home and come back later to pick up your car.  Great selections and service.
5 Had to write a review because these guys are awesome!!! In and out in less than 30 mins. They patched my tire for free too!! Definitely coming back!
