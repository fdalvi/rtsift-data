5 I'm very satisfied with my tat! This is my very first time so I was a bit hesitant at first. The tat artist is very professional and knowledgeable. Price is very reasonable compared to others! The place is clean and everything he uses is up to date, sterile,  unquestionable.
5 Down to earth, and professional. Arauna is awesome! Can't get much better! Clean, updated equipment. If you want a real traditional Polynesian tattoo, go to the man from Tahiti. He's open to fresh ideas as well, which is cool. All around great tattoo experience! Thanks brother!
5 Hands down, the best polynesian tattoo artist in AZ. Arauna is very down to earth and very welcoming. He asks a lot of questions during consultation to see what you value the most to incorporate it into your tattoo. Arauna is also well versed in different polynesian styles. Highly recommended to anyone thinking about getting some Polynesian work done. I have had two pieces done by him and absolutely love his work. Brotha Arauna... Best in the biz!
