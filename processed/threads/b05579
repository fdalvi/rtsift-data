4 Brought my grandpa here yesterday to shop for a new chair. Our salesperson was the owner. She was very helpful and gave us free shipping on a $400 chair.
1 Nope. Not worth it.
4 I am a huge fan of the furniture selection that they carry. The showroom tends to show a more old fashion style. The catalogs that they carry will showcase a larger variety of different items. I ended up going through most of the Coaster and Homelegance collections to find a varied selection of items.   Sandy, the owner, is amazing. She sat with me and gave me a deal on everything I chose. I ended up leaving Hotai feeling like I got the best deal I could have. I set out a budget for all my furniture and did not reach the amount. I looked online afterwards to add up my coffee table, sectional sofa, dining room table, eight chairs, two nightstands, and a chest to find that it would have cost me more to purchase it all directly.   If you are a first time homeowner like I am, you will be in great hands.
5 Me and my man were searching all over vegas for the best furniture, yet best deals in town. Before coming here, we probably came across 12 furniture stores that seemed to give a rather good deal. But when we randomly came to this store, the owner himself and his wife came to help us look around which I thought was really nice of them. We fully furnished my man's house here, so yes, we bought A LOT of their furniture. Not only did they give us the best deal in town, their service and furniture were outstanding. I'd definitely come back here when I need furniture
