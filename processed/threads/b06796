1 This is the worst place I have been to for nails in a very long time.  The employees are very, very rude.  The elderly woman that did my nails cut into my foot so badly that it started to bleed.  When I pulled my foot away from her she said, " oh honey, it's not that bad". Really??? I showed the owner what had happened, and that I was very unhappy.....she could of cared less. All she was interested in was my money.  This was the first time in my life that I have ever stiffed anyone on a tip for services.  Also, $40 for a regular pedi in the mall.  Wow, where are we, Beverly hills? And here I was thinking this is Madison!
3 I,ve been there about a dozen times..sometimes good, sometimes not.  I was there yesterday and the woman who (finally) came to take my payment was just unfriendly.  My debit card didn't go thru the first time, no fault of mine.  I jokingly banged the counter and she said "calm down ma'am", with a dirty look.  Yikes!  Another time, the tech just walked away.  I sat there and finally said to whoever would listen "are you done?"  I think they are arrogant and should knock it off.  It's a nail salon.  In Hilldale.  Big deal!
2 Fast. However polish job is really bad. Clean-ish. I don't think it's unsanitary.
1 Fancy Nails is probably the worst place I have ever been to get my nails done. The first time I went I just got a basic manicure and they did an ok job. The place is fairly clean and I left mostly satisfied. The second time I went in I got a shellac manicure and it has horrendous. I have honestly never paid to have my nails done and have the result end up so sloppy. The manicurist was not paying attention and messed up and had to take all the polish off and start over again twice! When she finally finished the result was a bubbled smudgy mess.  I would honestly never set foot in this nail salon again especially for the prices they charge.
