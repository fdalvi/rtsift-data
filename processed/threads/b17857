5 Okay... just let me say, these guys are the best! My family and I stayed in Scottsdale for 5 weeks this past summer and we frequented Baskin Robbins almost every single night. No kidding. And, yes, my butt thanks me not for such goings on. But at any rate, we have never met such a friendly ice cream staff. I am a PITA when it comes to ordering my ice cream -- I like jamoca ice cream with almonds mixed in, then I like my fudge on the side and I like extra fudge. This sort of ice cream order has raised a few brows, and furrowed some in the past, but not here, not these guys! And the couple of times, my rice-high (from the sushi place next door) son dropped his cone on the floor, they were so kind and understanding about it, they just scooped up the mess while they joked around with my little one about all the ice cream they've had to wipe off the floor in the past with other customers, and made him a fresh new cone, adding extra sprinkles, for good measure. Viola! No more tears and only big smiles from that moment on. They really are the best! I can't wait to visit them again! :)
5 Try a Rainbow Sherbet freeze!  It is a shake with out milk, made with Sprite (or soda water) It is the most refreshing best tasting drink around.  If the person behind the counter looks @ you funny, just tell them Daren said just make it the same as a shake, same # of scoops, same ounces of liquid, etc.   18 years ago, I was the one slinging the sherbet. (19th Ave and Bell Rd)  Thanks for the memories John and Mary Young!  I prefer mine a little runny, so I can actually drink it.
4 Great place for ice cream and has been for years. This store is clean and well managed. My 3 favorites are chocolate anything, cherry and seasonal peppermint. Chocolate cherry milk shakes are the bomb! It's a heart attack in a glass!
5 CLOSED!  We returned from a two-week vacation and this location had closed! Anyone know what happened?  Is there any connection to the Coldstone Creamery opening in the nearby  Fry's?
