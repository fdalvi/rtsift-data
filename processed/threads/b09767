1 I never win.   Except once... but the macine was broken. They took their money back. Now I'm sad. Thanks for reminding me.
4 This was a nice casino experience.  It wasn't as loud as Las Vegas.  The food was really greasy and made me a bit sick.  Admittedly, I chose to eat at the fast food place inside the casino, but ah well.  I still had a great time.  I don't really gamble, so I only came out $10 ahead, but it was still fun.
3 The smoking there is a mess....  The black jack table is always good to me.
1 I had to throw my food away it smelled so rancid from the Greece. The staff was not helpful, and when I went to cash into my bonus points they said I spent it . What a rip off. Never again!
3 its an ok place to go it is close to home.
