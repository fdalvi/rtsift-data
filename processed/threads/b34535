1 So bad that words fail me. First of all, $69 for 4 rooms became $459. After 15 minutes of haggling and a "call to the boss", I got it down to $189. The end result was horrible....he worked for 2 hours and it looked like he didn't even use shampoo. I had to browbeat the guy to get on his knees and pick up the debris he left behind, and it STILL looked bad. This one might result in a credit card arbitration. Unbelievably horrible.
