3 Jennifer Croll is a hit or miss at times.  You may be thinking you got a bargain on those Michael Kors flip flops that were 30% off at Jennifer Croll...but then you realize they were from 2 seasons ago!  Stocked with casuals such as Ella Moss, Theory and Izod as well as some dressier items by Catherine Maladrino.  They have a pool table there for impatient husbands.
3 I enjoy this store.  It has a nice selection of denim, lots of pretty cocktail dresses, great bridesmaid dress options, and the staff is generally helpful.   Fun stuff for guys too.   My only problem is that it carries a lot of the same stuff you can find at high end department stores and the merchandise does not turn over as fast, so I usually don't feel compelled to come here.  If I do, it is usually because I am headed towards Mahsa and I have some extra time.
3 Totally agree with the other reviews....hit or miss. Sometimes it's cute and sometimes it's not.
