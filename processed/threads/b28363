4 I couldn't find this anywhere on here so I decided to add it myself.  Tammy is totally awesome!  She knows what she is doing w/massage.  Her skills are amazing and she makes one feel so comfortable.  Pricing is reasonable, location is good.  Go there and try it.  You won't go wrong.
5 Tammy is an amazing massage therapist and I highly recommend her to everyone.  One of the best massages I have ever had.  She is also a fabulous person with a gentle spirit.  This makes the experience with her one of the best you will have.
5 I have been getting massages here for over a year and Tammy always finds the spots to ease the pain.  I like the use of warm towels too.  Give her a call.  If you are dealing with pain she can help you out.
5 Excellent massage! I booked 90 minutes while I was in town for spring training. I found Tammy to have an excellent personality, the massage to be firm and relaxing, and the price to be very reasonable. I'll definitely book again next year!
