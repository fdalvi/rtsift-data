5 Renee is seriously the best airbrush spray tan artist ever! I have never had so many compliments on a spray tan than when she does it! It is so natural looking and you NEVER look orange like an Oompa Loompa! Her product is also all natural so you aren't putting anything toxic onto your body! She also comes to your house which is super convenient and her prices are unbeatable for the quality of work she is doing! Please try Renee out because I know you will love your spray tan as much as I love mine!
5 I went  to Renee for a spray tan and was pleasantly surprised how comfortable she made me feel..she answered all of my questions and I got a fabulous Spray tan that lasted about 10 days. I liked the solution she used...I looked great!
5 One word... AMAZING!! I got a deal for 4 sessions and have used 2 so far. One for an all day concert and one for a birthday weekend in sd. Both were flawless tans! This girl is awesome! She even comes to your house to do them! 5 stars for sure!!  Maria genovese
5 I love Renee!! I get one religiously once a week!!! I have a crazy work schedule and she is always super flexible. It's so nice to be able to roll out of bed and get a spray tan. She has a pop up tent that doesn't require a lot of space and never leaves a mess. Her prices are amazing too! I've been all over Vegas for spray tans and she is the best and most reasonable.
5 One word, amazing! Renee is very flexible and will work with your schedule, she is quick to respond and her prices are reasonable. She is very knowledgable about the products she uses and my spray tan turned out great!
