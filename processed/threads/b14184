4 My husband tends to lose things... or as he says, he tends to "temporarily misplace" things.  He recently lost his car keys, and when they didn't show up weeks later, we decided we should call a towing company and tow the car to the dealership so they could make him a new key.  We learned that some towing companies cannot tow if you don't have a key to the vehicle.  But after just a few phone calls, we called United Road Towing (dba Fast Towing), and they came to the rescue.  They arrived within 30 minutes and while they originally quoted over $90 for the job, we bargained with them a bit and got them down to $75.  Still, a lot of $$ for losing your car keys, but what were we going to do?!  Hopefully we won't need a towing company for a long time, but if we do, I wouldn't hesitate to call Fast Towing again.
1 Be sure to read Laurie Roberts' column in the Arizona Republic of September 20, 2011 to see how this outfit treats their employees.   That is the reason I give them ZERO STARS.  Use a towing service that does not enslave their former employees.
5 I am a Good Sam Club Platinum Plus member, it's July 4 not much is open mechanically. My Toyota motorhome is sitting in a church parking lot w/a cut wiring harness, w/the risk of impound that Monday. Low and behold Kenny pulls up in his Fast Towing 24hr service flatbed to pick up my Toyota motorhome & take it to Little Dealer Little Prices to get worked on. If this is the same one that picked me up,which I'm pretty sure it is,the next time I need a tow they'll be the first ones I call.
