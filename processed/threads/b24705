4 I think that all Victoria's Secrets are essentially the same, but I like this one location in particular because, 1) it's close to home, 2) It doesn't seem like it's always crowded, 3) Service is great! The ladies there are actually very helpful, and friendly, I haven't encountered any stinky attitude, and they've treated me really nice. I recommend this location!
5 I needed a new bra. I went to this store and they had salespeople who helped measure and fit me all the while being modest and professional. I left with a great fitting bra and ordered a second one that they shipped to me at no extra charge.  It was one of the most pleasant shopping experiences I have ever had. I left feeling happy.  Very pleased and enjoying a nice supportive bra. I am 47 yrs old.
4 Good quality underclothes & reasonably priced lotions & body sprays.   Their year round 5 for $25 underwear sale is a great bargain! I have yet to find a better deal for underwear that are that well made, comfortable & cute.  The bra's can be pricey, but they frequently have sales and send out discount coupons.   My 2 favorite body sprays are Very Sexy & Bombshell. I like that they have travel size bottles for $10. It's so much easier to pack them in a carry on or a purse.  Their lotions are very similar in look, feel & price to the Bath & Body Works lotions.
5 Love this location! It's close to home and rarely ever crowded. If your anything like me and dislike being in crowds stuck inside a mall somewhere..then definitely come here. The girls are always helpful and willing to do anything they can to make your experience easier.
