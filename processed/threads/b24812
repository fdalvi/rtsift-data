5 I love this pandora store, they really go out of their way to help you and have wonderful Customer service!!!!! LOVE PANDORA!
1 This store is run by the same people that ran Hannoush Jewelers at Chandler Fashion Center mall.  I wont give them a dime of my money.  Yeah, I am still bitter about the 700 dollars I was not refunded from their now closed store.
4 Pandora's jewelry is very expensive and not my cup of tea. However, my mom decided she wanted their charm bracelet so now I find myself in this store a couple times a year. While I resent paying $30-50 for a little silver charm, I'm relieved that I have a great gift option for my impossible-to-shop-for mom. The fact that this Pandora has EXCELLENT customer service is a wonderful added bonus. I'll never bother ordering online because 1. I'm too cheap to pay for shipping and 2. Working with the women at this store is truly pleasurable.  I wanted a snowman charm for my mom's Christmas present this year, but it sold out at that store. First they arranged for a pick up at the Scottsdale store, but it came back into stock at San Tan just a few hours after I left. They called me right away to pick it up. When I returned a few days later, they knew exactly who I was and what I was waiting for even though it was a different salesperson helping me. That demonstrates great communication amongst their staff.  I'll be back on Mother's Day!
