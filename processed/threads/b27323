4 This place is great and affordable. Not the typical massage place but their style works great for me.
4 $30 for an hour long massage, $55 for a two hour long massage.  It's definitely not a swanky massage parlor though... so if that's what you're looking for head over to Cloud Nine in Tempe  You leave your clothes on, get ushered back and put in a reclining chair separated from other reclining chairs with hospital like curtains.  They get the job done though, I love it~!
4 Sarah H and I came by here for a massage after lunch on Friday and I agree completely with Dan H.  It's not the typical massage (your clothes stay on) but felt great and you can't beat the price.
5 Truly amazing. I was a previous massage envy customer and was tired of the weak massages and tired of the lack of knowledge across the board. Not to mention they wouldn't stop charging my card every month. When I first left TLC, I remember driving home in awe. I had never had a massage as thorough in my life, and at HALF THE COST!! Some weeks I go two times a week, my back and body overall has NEVER felt better. Warm foot soak, pressure points, just heavenly. I am a customer for life.   As for the other  person complaining about the owner smoking and had to reschedule; give it a rest, stuff happens. His smoking is of no importance. They are better off not having a pain in the @$$ like you as a customer anyway.  Try it and compare it to any place in the valley, you will be amazed.  Jim  PS: hurry back Lili!
