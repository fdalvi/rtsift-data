3 I was on my way home through Chinatown last night and decided to stop here for gas.  It's was only slightly higher than Costco prices and since it was later, it was an easy in and out.  They have a multi-point pay system.  Insert your card and then enter the pump you're using.  After pumping, you return to the pay area to get your receipt.  A painless process and at 10:15 not a crowded one.
4 3.27 for gas !!!  This is my main do to gas station.  Its right down the street from my house and is the cheapest (near me), the ampm is really small but they always have fresh and stocked shelves.  Its a little hard to get in and out of during rush hour, but worth it for the gas prices.
4 I stop here on my way home from work, when I need gas.  It's the least expensive gas station from Las Vegas Blvd, to Summerlin. Prices are comparable to Costco.  You have to usually wait a few minutes for an available pump. However it's not a ridiculous amount of time.  I've gone in, and received exceptional service, each time. If I'm in a hurry, I use the kiosk located outside.  I will continue to pump gas at this station, as long as they keep prices low.
