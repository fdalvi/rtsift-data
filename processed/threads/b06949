5 Fantastic service and knowledgeable staff! Repairs and sells all sorts of light fixtures and accessories (old and new) -great place to find replacement glass for ceiling fans! You should stop by and look around -it's a cool old shop.  I heard this place is where New Orleans sent its large historical chandeliers and light fixtures to be fixed after Hurricane Katrina.
5 Very helpful! They've done great, inexpensive repairs for us, and once walked us through a repair over the phone. Old school, but in the best sense.
