4 $19 hair cut, with free shoulder massage. Best cut I have had in an age. If you are sick of salon prices this is the place to go.
4 Great haircut! Great price, too. I was on vacation and needed a quick cut. Its next to a coffee shop. The barbers are really friendly. Worth looking up!
4 Both Sam and Olga do an excellent job. They are veterans. They take appointments.
5 Well, this is like finding the end of the rainbow - yes this is a pot of gold barbers shop. Ultimate service, great conversation, and they can cut hair better than anywhere else in the valley. I suggest some of the so called upmarket Scottsdale hairdressers visit Sam's to experience real good old fashion customer service..
