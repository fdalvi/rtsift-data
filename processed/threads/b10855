5 My hubby and I decided to check out this church and we were very pleased with the service.  We arrived about 10 minutes late and the usher was nice enough to find us seats.  Although, we arrived late, we felt welcomed.  Their customer service is impeccable.  This church is true to their statement:  Come as you are.    They have ample parking available.  Service times are convenient.  The auditorium is spacious.  Location is conveniently close to home.  They also have a seating area for families with infants.  Oh and get this, they sell Starbucks coffee...yummy!
5 I love the Crossing. They are very welcoming. Every thing is so convenient. There's a separate place for your children if you want, Starbucks inside w/ complimentary coffee, a huge parking lot.   There is no pressure. They have small groups available to those who would like to sign up. They always get involved w/ the community in helping those in need. The live music really gets you hyped up to worship the Lord. Most importantly, I love the messages they share every Sunday. The bottom line..It's all about the love for Jesus here.
4 This church reminds me of my home church back home. I just need to come more often and hear the word and receive my blessings. Since its very close to my house thats another plus.
5 Umm is it weird that I would feel weird giving any church a less than 5 star rating..? LOL Is that like giving Jesus a less than 5 star rating??? HAHA   I really do like this church. It's not too big and not too small. And they have really convenient service times.. I think 8AM, 11AM & 6PM ? I usually go to the 6PM service. It may be weird to some people because it's not a live sermon during the 6PM service.. It's a recording of one of the earlier services. But it's showed on 2 side screens and 1 huge high def center screen so it feels live and the message is definitely still just as powerful. The pastor is funny and not boring and gives sermons that you can relate to and that touch the heart. The worship is live and their team has a lot of amazing talent. They also take part in communion every Sunday.   Their motto is " Come as you are.." which is awesome because sometimes I just want to come with no makeup and sweats without being looked at like I'm crazy.. They often have a food truck in the parking lot. And they have their own cute little cafe..   HOT TIP: They serve complimentary Starbucks coffee.. haha
4 It's time for me to write some reviews of the churches i've attended since living in Las Vegas full-time ( 2006 )   My church reviews are limited to Sermon attendance on either Saturday, Sunday or Wednesday but primarily Sunday.  Also, another confession - i have yet to "formally" commit to any specific church ( I won't bore you with the details as to why. )   The Crossing is my " go-to" church.  It's the closest to my house, I've attended more "non-sermon" activities with this church than any other.  Sunday sermons are:  Live - 8:30. 10, 11:30 Recorded - 6 pm  Special times and days for Easter and Christmas  Pastor Shane is an above average speaker.  He's engaging, infuses humor at appropriate times and his message is positive.  At times, his message focuses on serious topics but the focal point is uplifting.  I find the other pastors that speak to be overly focused on humor and at times tangential in their message.  The music is amazing and very uplifting.    Not sure i agree with the weekly communion but it's a minor issue.  I'm impressed with how they reach out to help the community and abroad.  They are in the process of undertaking a large expansion of the Church - can't remember how much larger the building will be but personally, i'm not too comfortable being in a "large" church so still praying as to the Lord's will as to my future direction.
5 Can't beat this on a Sunday morning! This is my favorite church in Las Vegas. The staff and volunteers really show you how much they genuinely care about all that walk through the doors.  If you've ever been turned off by church because you felt you would be judged or were tired of the hypocrisy, this is where you need to be. No matter where you are in your life or how your walk has been, you will feel at home here. Plus... there's a cafe and free Starbucks coffee. :)
5 Been coming here over a year, we LOVE it here! It feels like HOME! The church's motto "come as you are" stands true here....you wont feel judged in anyway. Greeters and staff are mostly volunteers....so don't take it personal if you are the sensitive type and feel rubbed the wrong way (no pun intended)....come experience the grace of God with an open mind and a spirit of fellowship with everyone.  Pastor Shane is a humble man and always the first to acknowledge his weaknesses. As he always said, we are all on the same journey....his sermons are recorded live on their website. Four services on Sun 0830, 10am, 1130, and 6pm.  Coffee shop that serves Starbucks Coffee (try heir doughnut holes ;)  A bit "slow" right before each service time...think of yourself at starbucks drive thru in the am and you'll have more patience and peace :) volunteers at the coffee shop too. Childcare staffed with friendly volunteers and snacks/story times for tots A "casual" cafe /family room setting - called the "Venue" to encourage family worshiping together. some families bring their strollers, bfast there.  Worship teams are uplifting and if you allow God to work in you...you feel much of His presence during worship and service.  Bible study groups cover a wide range of topics that we all deal with from relationships to finances. They have  women, Men or mix bible study groups pretty much all week and varying hours and season so you can participate easily.  Its location right off 215/Buffalo is an easy drive.  They are currently building a new auditorium.
4 Great Starbucks coffee.  Enjoyed the worship team.    Pastor kept my attentions with his style.  Enjoyed the message.   Reminds me of other Mega church styles, including Elevation in Charlotte. Central, in Vegas and Saddleback Church, in Southern CA,
5 Have been coming here for many months now. As big as this church is they do a great job making us feel welcome and giving us chances to get involved. If you feel like you "fall through the cracks" it's because you are not grabbing the many chances to be involved.
5 Real. Involved. Caring. Pertinent.  Life-changing. Contemporary.  Authentic.  Community-minded. Visionary.  Humble.  Humorous.
5 Hands down one of the best churches I have been to. My wife and I had a great church in Denver and moved here and found the crossing. The music the message the people all are great  even the coffee is great. One thing that sticks out to me is how available the pastors are to you. They can be found all over the campus in the lobby after service and even emailed one and got a response within a hour or so.   So if your looking for a genuine come as you are church to call home this is the place!
