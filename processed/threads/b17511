1 Hey cops...just because I happened to be leaving a bar at 2 am doesn't mean I'm drunk.  I'm a tiny girl and I don't need three cop cars surrounding me and treating me like some second class citizen because it is your duty to protect and serve.  Thanks for throwing my purse on the ground, subjecting me to two field sobriety tests and a breathalyzer.  All in the freezing cold, while I was dying to pee.  Oh wait...I blew a 0.036.  I think that means I was telling the truth when I said I had two beers over the course of 4 hours.  Thanks for threatening me with jail time that didn't adhere to the law.  I loved hearing that you could give me a DUI if you thought I was drunk and my BAC was between 0.05 and 0.08.  Last time I checked the number line, 0.036 is less than 0.05.  Forget that actual crime that's going on around us, treating of legal drinking age girls like shit is more important.
4 Very impressed with Officer Seal's professionalism, despite the fact that I completely deserved to be chastised regarding my speeding violation and general dopey-ness as I sped down an unfamiliar road. As a motorcycle cop, his job is no doubt dangerous enough and it's drivers that make mistakes like I made that inadvertently cause harm to others. I would not have blamed him at all if he had lost his temper with me, I deserved it, but he employed his rational faculties tremendously better than I did that evening. The speeding ticket is not a welcome addition to a pre-law school budget, but it was deserved and I am grateful that the little pink kick in the pants brought me a little more down to earth.   Sincerely,  A Speed Demon, Reformed
