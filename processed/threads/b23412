5 Large store.  Great selection.  Not too busy, so it's easy to find a representative if you have questions.
1 This company is the worst. They send coupons all the time. We try them online and they work for the products selected. We go to the store (to keep the damn thing open and people in their jobs, online is feeding the unemployment in the country) and the cashiers always make an excuse why the coupons will not work. It is ridiculous. If it works online, it works in the store just the same, you're just being lazy.
4 First I will review their SALON:  LOVE IT! I have been getting my hair done here ever since I found it about a year ago. I have had some so-so stylists but most of them are great! Just this weekend I saw Jozenia and I absolutely LOVED her!! So super friendly and knows exactly what she is doing and how to do what you want. SHE is 10/5 stars!!   Now the cashiers/retail people:  The cashiers are never really super friendly, I don't feel like they are giving as great of customer service as they should be. Not smiling enough, not using Ulta members' names enough (a BIG one in my book! I don't care if you've never met me, if you say my name you automatically get brownie points!) Hardly available if you have questions. I would say that this location needs a cashier customer service seminar. That is the only reason why I didn't give this location 5/5 stars.   -Kayla C.
