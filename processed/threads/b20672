5 This is a great concept, and other restaurants should take notes too! Reds is the most family friendly restaurant that I have ever encountered, they have a buggy parking facility, a nappy changing room, a huge array of high chairs and best of all a great children's play area.  How many times have you been to a restaurant and you hear children whining and moaning, and its not their fault, they want to explore their environment, and that's natural, Reds has cottoned on to this idea and it seems to be going down a treat, every time I go past Mum's and Dad's pack out the place. Although every table in the restaurant has a view of the play area,  Reds also has a CCTV system that allows their children to be monitored even closer to ensure their well-being. Looking at the menu, it does seem to be a tad on the expensive side, but it does have a good varied menu for children with lots of healthy options and a good variety for adults too.
4 great place, friendly and relaxed.  Built around the idea of a genuine family restaurant with a small (big for the space) soft play in the back room.  You could go without kids, sitting in the front, but it's sells itself and really caters for families.  Excellent general facilities in terms of baby changing, space for buggies.  I like the food - not excellent but good quality and quantity.  Usually always a smile from the staff who seem to have the patience of saints given I have been in when it's like a chimps tea party.  I would love to see more genuine family spaces like this in Edinburgh.
5 After a disastrous day looking for somewhere to go to let my niece burn off some energy Reds was my saving grace!  It's only small but it does the job and there is always other children there for your kids to play with so you can sit back with a nice cup of tea and take a breather! Thank you Reds- you saved my bacon! xxx
