5 Have to say my wife and I have never found a better shop in all are life. moved out to AZ 4 years ago was driving around and found United car care II. The owner Trevor was really good. Man he loves is Rock and Roll. was having issue with a 1999 saturn sl2 with cooling sytem. said no issue with add some water to and ba boom it was done.  i take all my car here now. I live out in Surprise and when i need the tow truck to take they all ways want me to go some where eles. and i tell them no. So if you want a honest shop to work on your cars go talk to Trevor
5 I have been going here for about 7 years, and Trevor has always treated me respectfully and been honest about the work I needed done on my cars.  I won't go anywhere else, it's so difficult to find a mechanic you trust and I fully trust this place.  If I could give 10 stars I would!
5 Trevor is the owner and he is the hardest working owner I have ever seen, they are an honest establishment that has serviced our whole family's cars and we will continue to be a customer. Word of advise, they are always busy so call ahead to get your car in. to me that says a lot about a place of business.
