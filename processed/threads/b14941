4 I used to hate Pizza Hut... but my wife convinced me to try it.  I am now a regular patron of this establishment; I have never had an issues with it.  The crust is tasty (unlike back in the day), the ingredients seem good and its not overly salty (like Howies).  Nearly every time I order I can get a free side for a small amount of due diligence.  Hardly amazing but never having problems with a place like this is a sight to behold :)
1 I swear, I have never seen anything like this horrible service I received today.  I am ordering and she interrupts me with "phone number", "name".  Ok.  I ordered, she gave attitude, then left.  She didn't come out when people came in ten minutes later either.  I ordered one other thing after I flagged down a different guy since she would not come out. Oh, those other customers simply left. When she finally came out, there were more customers who she never even approached, simply waiting there.  Wow.
4 Alfredo pasta. Lot a cheese, hot and melted, two pans for 12, w breadsticks. I had no problems ordering ahead and picking up on the way home. C'mon people, this is fast, cheesy and just right for the rug rats, what else you want from a fast food joint.
