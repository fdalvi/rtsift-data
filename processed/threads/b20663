3 Another day, another Margiotta that I didn't know about.  This one is located on Shandon Place, not far from Slateford Road.  There was I believing that Margiotta was an exclusively Marchmont establishment, but how little I know!  This Margiotta is a bit like a tardis - much bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside.  I expected to find it to be the size of a small cornershop, but instead it was like a rabbit warren of many different sections.  It has the amounts of produce that you would expect from a small supermarket rather than a local cornershop.  As with all of the branches of Margiotta, the prices are high.  Even compared to Tesco, the prices were a fair bit more.  A 500g box of Rice Krispies was Â£2.49 for example.  Whilst the quality may be good, you are paying for that.  It's not the sort of place that I would choose to do a week's shopping at, as with a 24 hour Asda down the road, I know where I would go.  For good quality local convenience, Margiotta is unlikely to be bettered.  If you travel a bit further, you will find the same things for a lower price.  So don't be sucked in without checking all of the competition!
4 plenty of veggie and vegan yumm goodies and so much more than you could imagine them fitting in
3 Not the cheapest local shop but has a good range of products and often does wine deals to compete with the multiple's. Margiotta's is great for picking up last minute items and has a great range of salads and dinner items. Not so great for gluten free foods (no bread) but some of their indian range (pakoras/bahjis) are gluten free and they stock Mrs Crimbles coconut cookies if looking for a quick fix.
