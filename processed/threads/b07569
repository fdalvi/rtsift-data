2 This is one of those little Deli's that you will see all over the place near large corporate office buildings (ahem, Liberty Mutual, ahem).    I've had really good experiences with a lot of these in the past.  They generally have surprisingly good food for pandering to the "I forgot my lunch and don't want to waste half of it driving" crowd.  Unfortunately this is not one of them.  They do have a few tolerable sandwiches - the French Dip and the BBQ steak sandwiches are not bad.  However, anything with poultry is likely to leave you disappointed at the quality of the deli lunch meat.    The lady who works there is SUPER nice and is always willing to help with a smile, but I just can't ever justify heading here except when I forget my lunch.
3 I'm going to add a star after a year of patronage.  This has always been the case, even after the new ownership, but the owners and employees have always been super nice - the nicest.  Always smiling, always eager to help and lend a spoon etc. when the moment hits.  This being said, I have a really really really really tough time justifying spending $6-$7 for a sandwich I could have made myself if I didn't waste all my time in the evenings playing XBox or studying, and forget to make my lunch or go buy it.  Ok, whew.  I feel a lot better now.
3 Slightly expensive for just a sandwich/salad/lunch item (can rarely get out of there without spending $8-9) BUT the owners are extremely sweet and the staff is always very nice. Along with that and the convenience to my office, it's tough not to keep going back :)
