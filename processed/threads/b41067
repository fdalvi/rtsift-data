5 This Visionworks location is clean and has a friendly and helpful staff. The selection of frames is extensive. Will definitely return. Dr Davis is excellent.
5 We got our daughter's prescription yesterday but the office that we always go to has a very few selection for children's frames, so we decided to go over here. Used to be EyeMaster. Made sure that they are taking VSP. Lots of frames to choose from. Staff (especially Ally) was very nice. Even the other tall lady that works by the front desk was nice too. But Ally helped us personally and after all her calculations we only paid $70+, this include our co-pay $20, light lens(forgot what it's called??) anti-reflective, anti scratch, 1 yr warranty for $15. Although personally we don't need the warranty, I still took it just in case (my kid is only 7 y.o.). So from previous experiences... $70 is cheap! We'll definitely recommend this place. And I hope they don't change staff because they are perfect!
5 The staffs greeted me and were very pleasant.  Dr. Davis is one awesome doctor. The best. I will definitely go back for my annual eye exam and any other vision problems.
5 By far, one of the best customer services of any business I have ever dealt with. All the staff there treat me very well even thought I return my glass 3 time because of the manufacturer defect in the lens. Each and every time they gave me a new pair with a smile. I will be doing business here for life.
