5 Great selection of craft beers and even some craft beer cocktails.  37ish big screen tv's and gaming.  All the bartenders are cicerone server certified.
5 My favorite place to gamble on the strip.  Good selection of beer and drinks, and great for blackjack, craps, roulette while watching the game.  Love this place.
5 Been many times to Vegas and finally, I found a bar with A LOT of craft brews! Eat your heart out Yard House! This is a fresh new experience on the strip, and what separates them from the Yard House was not the beer, but the service! I came to the bar at the end of our first friendly waitress' shift.(She had a blonde streak in her hair but didn't catch her name) The next waitress to take care of me and my crew, Heather, was equally as friendly, yet another bar tender, Tim, seemed to just want to hang out and tell me and my friends the stories behind the beers we were drinking!  (Not in a creepy way, nor did he didn't ignore his own customers). I had a beer from Kenya, my girlfriend had one from Singapore, and my friend had one from Ireland we all never heard of. Tim sold, through his story, my friend the Irish beer. Service aside.. They have many beers from the states, as well from around the world. Currently, and as a fun hobby, I am making a beer top table, of the different beers I drink. Normally I receive awkward looks from bartenders on requesting the bottle top, but every bartender here embraced my request, and it seemed like they were actually having fun finding and looking for tops. The next time I am in Vegas, I will definitely come back to the Tag.
5 Best bar on the strip by far. The wait staff knows about every beer they sell (over 300!) and are super friendly. Will comp good beers if you play video poker, and even if you don't the prices are so low for the location. Love gambling in the quad too (small ish and clean). It is a must see in my opinion!
