5 Took in a Meat cleaver and just a regular 8" kitchen knife.  You can shave with either of them, they even put a tip back on the 8" knife that had broken off!  and very inexpensive!!!!
5 Fast and friendly service with reasonable pricing. My french knife is now like a razor. Will take more over for them to work on. Plus they do garden tools and scissors. Its better than brand new knifes!
5 $15 to sharpen 5 knives - what an incredible deal.  I purchased Henkel Twin Pro S  knives and was a little disappointed when I used them out of the box.  The chef's knife is now cutting thin slices of fruit with ease and my meat cleaver went through chicken bones like it was butter.  I will take my steak knives in next.
5 Jay's Sharpening Service does a swell job always! I recently brought in my wife's well-used kitchen knives, among them her pathetic bread knife, which I swear is made from pot steel of some kind--the thing is pure junk, and yet, for some unknowable reason, she likes the underachieving POS. Jay's actually made this lousy thing cut for the first time, so now we have bread slices, instead of bread smashes! Also, these folks put razor edges on all of the crazy lady's other kitchen knives, and on my best folders, too! I highly recommend Jay's sharpening Service. This is a professional shop that caters to the best chefs in town, and Las Vegas is known for good food and the persons who make it. (Jay's sharpens scissors, as well, and that is the most useful service of all, because you know that they are a perfect bore to do on your own.) Finally, Jay' is cost-effective, three dollars per straight blade, and so we visit them about once a month to keep everything working right.
