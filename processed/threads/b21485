5 If you've read my previous post about Aunt Lena's Creamery closing, you know that I was fretting about where to find Twinkie gelato.  No more worries!  We went to Gelato Fantastico not long ago and met the owner.  She was very personable and enthusiastic.  After talking to my friends, she decided to make TWINKIE gelato and even named it after my friend!  VERY cool!   We sampled multiple flavors and had difficulty making up our minds- they were all delicious and no ice crystals to be found!   I'm always happy to see peanut butter and of course, Diamond's Twinkie Deluxe!  I'll be back to try more flavors!
5 Gelato Fantastico is a much needed gelato place in Gilbert.  I used to visit the place near San Tan Village, but was very bummed when it closed.  Soon after, Gelato Fantastico opened up and I had a place nearby to get my gelato! Also just an FYI if you are looking for this place at night the sign can be VERY hard to see from the street because it is a dark brown color.  The place is very nice, and the owner Michelle is also very nice.  The gelato is really good, and they change out their flavors very often so its not always the same thing.  I really love the fruit flavored ones, but that is just my preference.  Overall, if I want gelato, this is the place I go!
