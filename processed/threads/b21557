5 This is as good as sushi gets.  It's a little hidden so we nearly missed it driving by while looking for somewhere to fulfill our sushi fix.  Thank goodness for my eagle eyes because this place is by far the best sushi place in town.  TRUST ME.  Customers from their old place are so loyal that they drive all the way from Henderson (where the restaurant originated) to Southwest Las Vegas.  Yes, it's that good.  The fish is fresh and the sauces they use are indescribable.  Octopus and green mussels were gross to me before but after the owner gave me free samples to try I was hooked.  Even the sushi rolls I would normally be wary of, I tried and loved them all.  Their hand rolls are twice the size you'd get at any other sushi joint.  Be adventurous and try whatever the owner suggests.    I haven't tried the Hibachi yet so I gotta make another trip there soon.  Seriously I can't imagine sushi getting any better than this.
3 Went there last night on a whim.  It's close to where I live and they are open till midnight, which helps when you work swing shift.  It was a slow night for them, only one person at the sushi bar and one at the tatami tables in the back.  We sat at a table and our waitress brought us some Sapporro and sake which were surprisingly cheap.  We started out with Gyoza and a salmon skin roll which were pretty good.  Then we had a Stacy roll, which the waitress said was their most popular.  It wasn't bad, I just prefer raw stuff.  The Stacy roll is shrimp tempura and cucumber with crab on the outside.  I thought my BF would like it because he doesn't eat raw stuff but he just thought it was so-so. The best part of the meal for me came next which was the Nabeyaki Udon. I was pretty impressed by their udon.  It came with a bunch of tempura, including two pieces of shrimp.  Inside the bowl was mushroom, tofu, onion, egg, chicken, and noodles.  Pretty good I have to say.  We also had the beef curry, which was a bit runny and bland.  Overall, it was an ok place.  On the plus side everything is reasonably priced.  I'll have to ammend my review when I go back to try their raw stuff.
3 This place is probably the best cheap (er) sushi I've had in Vegas. Service is SLOW. I mean. SLOW. It will take you a while to eat here so open up some time and go with a friend you haven't seen in a while (that you like obviously, it's easy to have awkward silences here wondering where that roll you ordered an hour ago has gone.)    In my stomach:  surf and turf -- albacore tuna covered in medium rare kobe beef (mmm) birthday roll -- YUM spider roll -- NO. LAME. WITHOUT FLAVOR. beef teriyaki -- Not bad...generic beef available everywhere...but it's good if you're not into sushi. stacie roll -- came with the combo beef. SUPER GOOD.   They have mochi ice cream which I love, but they only give you one, which isn't standard anywhere else. But they had red bean which made my mom happy. Not a date place to make a good impression -- this is like -- you have to take someone out because of some stupid meeting, or maybe you just need something decent with friends.
3 Slightly better than average, more like a 3.5 stars place. I was on the way to Naked Fish - my absolute favorite sushi place in terms of price to quality. Showed up, Naked Fish was closed for the company Christmas party. No problem, Kai is open.  Headed to Kai with 2 friends, proceeded to order 7 rolls.  So far so good. Just got home, I'm taking the obligatory post sushi shit, it only burns a little bit, so we're golden.   Excellent sushi selection, great prices. The eel could have been a little bit more fresh, but for the most part, I was pretty impressed.  Service was great at the beginning, but our waitress ended up leaving about halfway through our meal. The restaurant was closing shortly, but we weren't sitters, and we weren't the last people there. It took awhile to get someone's attention in order to square up on the bill, but all in all, a pleasant experience.
5 Hands down the best sushi place in Las Vegas. They have the best quality and freshest ingredients in town. If there is something you like on your sushi that doesn't normally come on it they will make whatever you want. The staff is awesome. Everyone is nice, it is comparably priced to other sushi joints. Sometimes the service does get slow and they under-staff often. We have been going there for years and drive from Sunset and Stephanie all the way there. All in all, great food, good service...
5 I've been patronizing the sushi chefs that opened Kai for over 8 years.  Simply put, they have the best sushi in Las Vegas.  Their fish is always super fresh and they have great specials like Baby Tako and Green Mussels that I am so spoiled by I won't even order them anywhere else.  They give generous portions, and are always happy to make you something you might never have tried.  My favorite rolls are the Stacey and the Surf and Turf - YUM. But if you simply want nigiri, you can't go wrong here. Their salmon, yellowtail, and albacore are all superb. My boyfriend swears by their uni (not my favorite) and adores their kobe beef.  If you like sushi you can't beat Kai for the freshness and tastiness of the food, and knowledge and friendliness of the staff.  It's the only place in town where I go and get greeted with a hug by the hostess, Moon.  They treasure their regulars and are treasured in return.
5 When I first came here, I was very skeptical but little did I know that I would actually love this place!  Prices are very good.  Quality of food is excellent.  You can definitely taste the freshness of the fish.  Although, they don't have a lot of selections when it comes to their all you can eat sushi, it's still the place I go to when I crave it.  They just started it so that can be one of the reasons they didn't add all the sushi on that menu.  They have the best Green Mussels ever!  My all time favorites are the chef's specials like the Island Roll...I love it!  I haven't tried anything that I didn't like.    The staff here are very nice.  The atmosphere is great.  Very clean restaurant.
3 We came here with a fairly large group (about 6 people) on a Saturday night around 730. It wasn't busy except for another large group next to us and a couple of people at the bar. We put in our first order and everything came out quickly except our Sweet Ebi. Being at a table with 4 hungry boys we put in another order. This order took quite some time and by that time the boys were starving all over again. They also told us that they had run out of hamachi. Really? Yellowtail is probably one of the more popular fishes that everyone orders and they didn't have any.  All rolls were good, nothing spectacular about it. It took probably a good 45 minutes for everything to come out.....they would bring one thing out at a time and then we would wait another 15 minutes for something else. After sitting there for a good hour and a half we decided that it was time to go. Even though some of the boys left hungry, we were just tired of waiting. The server had taken away the menu after we ordered the second round and that was another reason why we didn't order again. Sushi was decent, but I'm not sure I will be returning when there are a million gazillion other AYCE sushi joints out there.
5 Oh man!  I was down in Vegas a couple of weeks ago, and happened upon Kai Sushi.  First off, I was greeted like I was an old friend and promptly seated.  I ordered a few nigiri, and the quality was excellent.  It's been a while since I have had really good sushi, but this rivaled anything I have had in San Francisco or Tokyo.   It's good to see a sushi restaurant that cares so much about quality, and doesn't skimp.  I will definitely eat here again next time I get down to Vegas.
4 From the outside, you wouldn't expect much from this place but it's really a nice, pleasant experience.  The quality of the AYCE is superior to the competitors. This is why I mainly stick to the nigiri although I do dabble with the hot dishes which they offer a nice variety.   I recommend sitting at the bar to get quicker service. When it is busy, it can be slow.
5 This is the sister sushi bar to Sin City Sushi and as with all of Young's restaurants,  excellent quality and service!  Pancho is the bomb!  So's their Hokkaido Sea Scallops!  If Sin City is too busy, Kai is worth the drive down 215 to Flamingo and then a right on Durango to have the same exact quality seafood and sushi.  They even have a teppan yaki grill(like Benihana).  I took my family for my sister's birthday and we had a blast!  So much food!
5 Never really a lot of people there. Quiet and friendly for all you can eat. Vampire roll is a must. Also has the best green mussels in Vegas...a must try!
5 Kai is one of my favorite sushi places to eat because the staff is very friendly. Also, the chefs will recommend you the most popular rolls, based on what they sell the most which is very helpful. However, they don't offer a whole lot of rolls to choose from but the rolls they do have are yummy. Kai is one of the sushi places I enjoy eating the rolls, all I can say is I'm not a sushi roll eater I'm just plain Jane sushi eater.   My family and I (total of 20 people) all had AYCE without any rush. Other restaurants will rush you, since they do time you. But when you have a big group you should be able to take your time since everything doesn't come out all at once. If your not an AYCE fan they have a la cart for a really reasonable price.   Recommend for Appetizer:  Green Mussels  Oyster Shooter  Baby Tako   Yummy Rolls that you must try:  Stacie Roll  Spicy Shrimp Roll  Lobster hand roll (sorry not AYCE, but totally worth the $7)  Vampire Roll  Island Roll  Jamie Special  Japanese Lasagna   On the sweet side:  Kona Coffee Mochi
2 First time here because of a friend's suggestion. My sushi friend did a preliminary check with the restaurant by making sure they covered their fish and stuff. The staff is really friendly.  When we got our yellowtail, salmon, & tuna nigiri the rice easily fell apart and didn't taste good. The fish was good though because we ordered their freshest fish.   My sushi friends weren't very happy with the rice falling apart and whatnot. Me and two other friends had a stomachache during and after.  I mainly liked Dancing Tiger Roll. Stacie Roll was okay.
5 Seriously, only 13 reviews?  A Vegas gem. A local took me here. $22 for an all you can eat menu and the pickings were pretty amazing. The fish was fresh, the service is amazing. I was really impressed. AND I come from SF where the sushi is almost always amazing.   30 mins or so away from the Strip in an area where there's not really that much to look at. I will beg my cousin to take me here again because it's just got...::in the word's of Brian Wilson:: too much awesome.   Try that Stacie roll, it's off the chains!
5 This by far is my FAVORITE sushi restaurant in Las Vegas!  The fish is fresh, the service is fast and the staff is extremely friendly. The Starburst, Something Wrong 69, and Vampire Rolls are a must have!  And I can't forget to mention the mussells....oh the mussells are de-lish!  I've recommended this place to many friends and not one has been disappointed!
5 I adored this place even before they offered the AYCE option. This place has some of the freshest sushi in town. If you want the better quality rolls and nigiri, I suggest you don't get the AYCE... but it's delicious and either way.   They advertise the best green mussels in town and they're right! I stick with the nigiri in this place. You end up getting the best bang for your buck that way. Everything is wonderful and the servers are so nice. It can get busy and slower when they get busy, so I recommend sitting at the bar then.  Ask the chefs/servers what's freshest and just trust their judgment. It's all really good here. They have some awesome specialty rolls too and they're very accommodating if you have special requests.   Try it, you'll like it.
5 Throughout my life I have been fascinated by all things Asian. I as a child I saw my first Japanese Spinning Sex Basket. My father brought it home on my 3rd birthday...he had no present for me...unless you call a slap and "don't ever come in my room again" a present. Knowing him...I do. Years later he passed out and his Swisher Sweet fell out of his hand and burned down our trailer...for the 5th time.  I cried for the chair that had made it through 4 fires, 8 wives, 9 waitresses named "Rose" and a guy in a dress...named "Rose"...and it was gone. Craftsmanship, luck...and an incredible amount of lubricant has protected it over the years.  My father wept. He cursed God. He flogged himself with the red plastic track for my toy cars.  He ran away...neither me or his badly burned 9th female Rose ever saw him again.  I heard he spent decades trying to replicate the feel of that basket. an obsession that nearly killed him. Rose despite his burns was a good stepmother to me....until...well...that is another story.  Rex remembered...he remembered the squeals of delight...the screams of ecstasy...the snapping of the chain and the cries of help from my father and his companion of the day. He was insastiable...and animal...I was insatiable...and animal. I read everything i could about the Pacific rim...i nicknamed my anus "The Atlantic Rim"...I was a scholar of all things Asian. I even bought pictures of tigers on black velvet...very Asian.  I had two true Asian loves...Margret Cho and sushi.  Margret left me for some film director...I was crushed...but my search for all things sushi never subsided.  I would go to the finest sushi houses. I would eat canned tuna straight from the can. I was hardcore.  In these times of want and woe....I want roe...as much of it as I can eat.  All you can eat sushi is usually like having a naked dance party in a Weight Watchers...never good...and not good examples of what fun you COULD be having...if you were in a different situation.  Kai Sushi and Steakhouse is like having a naked dance party in the backstage area of the Victoria Secret modeling show.  It is heaven. It is perfection. It is better than Margret Cho in my father's basket. My dream of good all you can eat sushi is realized...great all you can eat sushi for under 25 bucks!!  If this is dreaming...don't wake me up.  I will start out with something not necessarily brought up first when reviewing all you can eat sushi...they have the best mussels in town! Bar none. Amazing. A touch spicy. A touch sweet. The best ever. Their sushi rolls are perfect. Great mix of some sweet, some crunchy, some with acidity, some with a combination.  The best roll...the Lion roll. Second best...the Stacy roll.  Everyone i had, in the many times I have been there, are great. The fish is so fresh, the roll is perfectly built, the sauces are spot on.  It is a miracle they do this for all you can eat.  They even do substitutions!!! I listened to a person ask to have a Stacy roll with cream cheese...and they did it! The salmon roe is excellent and the sashimi is very good as well...because the fish, and i can't say this enough...is so fresh, so tasty, that anything that is made with this kind of care is going to be good.   The tempura is perfect in the roll, out of the roll...and most importantly...for the soft shell crab. The soft shell crabs are included and they are great...you would think perfect...OH NO...not until you get the Charlie handroll.  The Charlie is the single greatest roll in all of Las Vegas...and the best I have ever had. People who come from NYC, Philly and other major cities have sat in silence with me and ate bite after bite in sheer amazement. The crab is crunchy. The sauce is creamy and spicy. It is the single best thing I have had in my mouth since the time I met Emma Stone.   Amazing service. Great people. The sushi chef is helpful and funny. The free refills of soda keep coming. The drinks are made strong and good!   The menu is full and very little isn't included. Much more than most all you can eat sushi joints.  Go. Eat. Think of Asia. Think of Rex. Think of the basket. Be in the basket with Rex...but he won't be with you.
3 Kai Sushi is located in an empty strip mall off of Durango. It was tough to spot at night because the sign wasn't lit up and the place looked dark from the outside.  When we walked in it was completely empty, except for one waitress and a sushi chef. I went with the all you can eat option ($26 I think) and my wife ordered some stuff a la carte. Here's what we got:  - Edamame - Garlic tuna sashimi - good and fresh. We got two orders, the cuts of fish in the second order were a lot bigger than the first order. A little consistency would be nice. - Hamachi sashimi w/ jalapeños and ponzu - delicious - Garlic tuna roll - yellowtail and avocado were on the inside and the garlic tuna was on top. The roll was soaked in sauce, making the rice mushy. meh... - Garlic tuna sushi - soaked in sauce. Again, mushy rice...ugh. - Dragon roll - the eel was delicious. - Hamachi sushi - two large slices of yellowtail. Rice was firm and sticky, no sauce. Perfect. - Albacore sushi - the fish was delicious but again a little too much sauce for me. - Crab - imitation crab. Not my favorite.  Decent food. There's some stuff I'd order again, others that I wouldn't. I might be back since I live close by.  Despite the place being empty the service was on the slow side. I'd hate to see this place when it's busy.
5 Best sushi in Vegas for the price. Green mussels are amazing. My favorite rolls are the Stacey and Vampire. Super fresh ingredients!!
2 Sorry Emily R.  I tried this place out because you told me it was your favorite but it looks like different strokes for different folks.  With that being said, I will still recommend you try it if you are a sushi fan like me and my boyfriend.  We absolutely love sushi!  Here we tried the Orleans Roll, Hamachi Special, Stacie Roll, Spider Roll, and a few nigiri such as Hamachi, and Salmon.  I was not impressed at all with the any of the rolls except the Stacie Roll which was the best one of them all.  The nigiri was disappointing because the rice to sushi ratio was ridiculous!  It ruins the whole AYCE process with the amount of rice they put in their nigiri.  They have a pretty good variety of side dishes but was not too impressed with their edamame; it was too salty.  The shrimp tempura came out just right, and I was happy to have a bowl of udon as a side dish.    They do have the best green mussels in town.  Yelpers did not disappoint on this one; I totally agree!  I still say try it.  I went twice with a friend, and another time with my boyfriend.  We all agreed, we won't be coming back.
3 The decor was very nice and the place is spacious.   Unfortunately, this place was empty. But that meant the sushi chef will take his time and cater to us.  Our server was a korean lady, she seemed a little gruff but topped our drinks often.   Joey, the sushi chef was very nice.  So nice, he gave us tips on other sushi joints he frequents.    Food was prepared nicely and fish tasted fresh but there was nothing special about this place that sets them apart from the many sushi restaurants here in Las Vegas.
4 After driving past Kai, I was pleasantly suprised to read all the great reviews on Yelp! and knew I had to check it out.  Although I love Sin City Sushi, it's a long drive from my new apartment.  Went on a Sunday evening.  Not a lot of people and everyone was sitting at the sushi bar, so that's where we sat.  We tried:  Cucumber Salad Oyster Shooters (2 orders) Poncho Roll Viagra Roll - Really loved this What the Heck Roll (1/2 order) Something Wrong Roll   Crazy Chic Roll (1/2 order)  First, let me say how freaking happy I was to learn you can do half orders.  When I go to a new sushi place, I want to try everything and rank it in comparison with other places.  So this was a super bonus.    Second, let's talk $$.  Again, while I love Sin City, Kai was much cheaper!  $23.95 for AYCE dinner, $35.95 for all you can eat AND drink and Kai apparently has a happy hour daily from 2 p.m. - 5 p.m.  when AYCE is only $18.95.  The 80 year old grandma inside of me rejoiced!    I tend to steer clear of AYCE establishments with a time limit, because I'm a slow eater and the idea of being timed stresses me out.  From what I could tell, there's no time limit here.  We were there about 2 hours.  Service was excellent.  Our server was kind of weird but very entertaining!  haha.  After chatting with some apparent regulars, we learned that the service is very different if you sit at a table instead of the bar.
4 **Summary**        - A very good value for what you're paying.        - Freshness - Average.        - Portions - Not too much rice.        - Their rolls/appetizers are unique and innovative.        - Their ponzu sauce is less sour and more spicy/garlicky than others.        - Decor - Decently decorated and roomy. **Price**        - $23.95 for dinner (5pm-11pm) AYCE Sushi **Ordered**        - Ahi Poke - I liked how their Ahi Poke was less sour and was spicy compared to others.        - Green Mussels - Can't go wrong there        - Dynamite - Good amount of scallops. However, they don't make their dynamite with mushrooms.        - Shrimp Tempura/Soft Shell Crab - Fried goodness        - Miso Soup        - Edamame        - Yellowtail/Ikura/Tobiko - Decent fish to rice ratio.        - Sweet Shrimp - Wasn't as fresh as it should be.        - Something Wrong Roll - Rainbow roll with shrimp tempura and a garlic ponzu sauce. Yummy and spicy.        - Pink Lady Roll - A variety of fish with tobiko and mango wrapped in pink soy paper. It didn't come with any sauces. A very nice light roll where you can really taste the fish.        - Skewers - A must try. I haven't seen any other AYCE place offer skewers. They had bacon wrapped scallops, shrimp, beef, chicken, and mushroom to choose from.        - Oyster Shooters - Yums.        - Avocado Lover - Avocado slices over a spicy tuna mix. Inventive and tasty.        - Strawberry Ice Cream **Recommendations**        - I would definitely recommend this place for their value. Though they are stronger in the appetizer/rolls category, their nigiri isn't too bad either.        - They even have a happy hour from 2-5pm for $18.95 with the same menu as dinner.        - They also have AYCE & unlimited hot sake/beer for $35
4 Went last night. One hour to closing OMG have to eat in a hurry....not! Found Anthony and Tai behind the sushi bar. It was great 36.00 AYCE and Drink Beer and Hot Sake.  Can you say "Sake"  I say "Bomb" Lordy , Lordy...Take a designated driver with you. Fish was incredible We left at 1230am. Stuffed and my Bro was quite drunk from Sake bombing with Chef Tai. I had to drive so only 2 small Asahi for me. BTW it was my first time here, but not my last.  Suggestion to owner: Get some regular Budwiser in bottles.
5 I actually don't like to get in sushi debates with friends. It usually ends with someone stomping off yelling something about shoving a hand roll in my face. People are VERY protective of "their" fave sushi spot. That being said, Kai (or at least its staff) introduced me to the world of sushi and they've never let me down.   Quick history lesson, Kai used to be a different sushi place entirely, located across from the Galleria. One day on our weekly voyage the owner told us they were closing and moving to Summerlin. We were elated since we lived over that way. A few months later we set out to search for the new location. All we knew was it was on Durango somewhere. Have you ever looked for a random sushi place on Durango? It's like saying, "I'm at PT's.". Impossible to find. Thankfully the owner called us and let us know their location and they were open!   The sushi is seriously so fresh and wonderful and they're willing to alter spice level or use soy paper for any of the rolls. They resisted the AYCE deal for a while but I'm glad they caved because it's worth every cent. My faves are the Moon Roll, Dynamite Roll and the Sue Roll. The green mussels are phenom and the baby tako is totally addicting. It's octopus, but don't be scared.   The service is great and they'll remember you if you go more than once. Their sister location is Sin City Sushi over on Eastern and Serene, same exact food and quality. YUM I'm starving now. :-)
4 I went here on many occasions because I used to live right across the street from Kai. For a Japanese restaurant located in an almost deserted parking lot, it really blew my mind away the first time I tried its cheap all you can eat menu. Unlike other Japanese restaurants, Kai's AYCE is only about $23.95 and if you wanted to include all you can drink, it is about $35 (which is cheap if you are a heavy drinker and can stomach it all).  Kai is a large restaurant, however the many times I've gone there.. There is always 1 woman waitress and about 2 people at the sushi bar. It is never crowded and the staff has not changed for a while now. I rather enjoy the seclusion because of its location, and due to the small occupancy, the service is always fast and genuine.   Their menu is a typical all you can eat sushi menu, however, it is more concentrated on the sushi rolls, than the appetizers. Kai is one of the few places that has Mango rolls, or rolls with mango in them. The combination is amazing and definitely worth a try. They also have the best tuna handrolls. The tuna handrolls are so fresh and spicy, it is definitely one of the best in town. Im a big fan of super white tuna, and so everywhere I go I have to order it. Their super white tuna is very fresh, extremely buttery and the cut is well proportioned. Dont be afraid to ask the sushi chef to accommodate for you, they are very nice and will give you a reasonable amount of fish. Unlike ichiza, which is well known for their more traditional dishes, Kais dishes are more creative and will have rolls that are influenced by different tastes all around. I dont remember the specific name of the rolls but when you look at their menu, you will notice the varieties in their sushi.  Their signature sushi dish is also very delicious. I believe it was called their Kai roll.  Overall, if you are looking for a quiet night with friendly services, I would definitely suggest going there. If anything, for the cheap price of an all you can eat sushi experience that will not damage your wallet but leave you full and happy in return.
4 I have been eating sushi since I was eleven years old. I've had ten years of experience, so by now I would know what good sushi tastes like. This place honestly isn't bad, but I wasn't fully impressed either. We went for Happy Hour (2pm-5pm) for around $19/person with the same menu that you get for dinner. Honestly, their service was a bit slow and bf and I were starving! But of course I have more patience than most people do, so I ordered two at a time. Plus, the sushi chef was also working on a table of six that got there before us (and they were ordering the BIG rolls). I went for my usual nigiri (salmon, yellowtail, halibut, and eel), I would've gone for tuna, tamago, and shrimp but I got full on the "Stacie" roll and Shrimp Lovers roll. We also ordered some sides: baked mussels, seaweed salad, skewers, dynamite, edamame--which were all good. Tried quail egg for the first time, which I actually liked lol. They also have some good "meat" options like teriyaki chicken and tonkatsu (which comes with rice). Their prices are on the lower end when it comes to AYCE sushi, which is what I like about this place. I wouldn't say they skipped on the quality either. For dessert, they have a good variety of flavors of regular and mochi ice cream. Not to mention they also have an a la carte menu to order from. Overall, not bad! I don't like reviewing places that aren't 5-stars, but I just have to mention that this place's happy hour is such a good deal!
4 I really love the rolls here, but the service is terrible. The waitresses are sweet, but they always mix up orders, forget them, or something. Nevertheless! I recommend the baby tako, kasia roll, vampire roll, and green mussels to name a few! So see for yourself! Enjoy :)
4 The sushi here is good especially the stacy roll! The prices aren't super expensive and it's actually pretty fair compared to other places like Naked Fish. Majority of the time the service is great but when it gets really busy sometimes they only have 1 waitress so it's a bit slow when you need service. Other than that I go to this place often because the rolls are good and the prices are decent.
5 I love great-tasting and fresh sushi at a steal! This is what this place offers. Make sure you have Anthony as your sushi chef. He is the best! Poor guy practically lives there, he said he works 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. Even though he works that much, he still makes awesome sushi consistently.  We came across this place when we found out that Naked Fish was closed for renovations. We're very glad we made that accidental discovery!  Their fish is so fresh and buttery, I don't even think I'm eating raw fish. I only started eating raw fish recently, when I discovered how good yellowtail nigiri was at SushiMon. No offense to SushiMon, but this joint made me love eating yellowtail nigiri so much more! Another one I love is the garlic tuna, it is so flavorful and so fresh!  For the price of $23.99 (dinner) and $18.99 (happy hour 2-5 pm), I think this place is so worth checking out. They have really great tasting specialty rolls too, one of them which is the Stacie Roll. Two thumbs up to Anthony for making sushi taste so great.  One more thing, their tamago is probably the freshest tamago I have ever tried anywhere. I could probably go to this place and just order tamago after tamago after tamago, because it is that good! It takes forever to make though, but it is so worth the wait.  The service has been excellent during both times we were there. This place was not crowded both times (I don't get why it isn't, the food is so good!) so the servers and sushi chef are dedicated to you and probably two other groups.  Do check out this place! The location isn't too good, it's on Durango (and there's never any traffic on Durango) and Flamingo, by the Salvation Army. But trust me, it is worth the trip!  By the way, they have $35.99 All you can eat and drink (alcohol) too if you're a heavy drinker.
5 I like Kai Sushi a lot, this is my default sushi place. It's pretty far from my house, but it's worth it to eat at a place I trust. The service is always friendly and prompt, our food always comes out in a good amount of time. It's always clean and there is a good atmosphere. I love the white tuna here, but garlic tuna and cajun albacore are close seconds.
