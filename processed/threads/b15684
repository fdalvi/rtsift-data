4 I don't bank with bofa but I come to this one to put money in my sons account and I can say this...the lines are never long like at other bofa
1 First let me say, I would never bank with B of A.   Unfortunately, when Countrywide collapsed, B of A gobbled them up. And I've had to deal with their crappy service ever since.   This branch isn't all that bad. But there is no-one here to help with mortgage problems. And I mean absolutely no-one. They aren't unfriendly. It is just that the behemoth that is B of A isn't easy to work with. And all the underlings are like mushrooms: keep in the dark and feed s@$t.   The left hand almost never knows what the right hand is doing.   So I give this branch three stars for OK people, and B of A gets a negative star for what they call service and we'll split the difference, since we have to give them at least one star.   I chose this branch because they are the closest to my house and when I went to them for help, they tried, but wound up just being able to throw their hands up and wish me luck.   B of A doesn't stand for Bank of America in my book, more like Behemoth of Arseholes.   Please be a responsible citizen and take your business elsewhere.
4 I love how this location has 2 24 hour access ATM's, one drive up and another walk up. The line at the drive thru even on Fridays around 5pm has never been more than 3 cars long. Always a pleasant experience. And with the new technology B of A implemented with their ATM's with the ability to automatically read checks has made check deposit process speedy quick.
