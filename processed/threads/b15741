5 Peppermint mocha is yummy!
4 I know you are probably wondering how a McDonald's can get a four star rating and to be quite honest I'm thinking the same thing. However, I will explain. I've been here numerous times, as it is convenient and an easy way to grab a quick meal or pretty good iced coffee. Usually there is a lenghty line at the drive through, but it always seems to go quick. Our lastest visit was no exception. After getting a sample of the Mighty Wings earlier in the day, I had made up my mind early to grab some for dinner. I was simply amazed, as they were much better than I could ever have imagined. A three piece will cost you three bucks, but they get less expensive as you buy in bigger quantity. When we got to the window, we were asked to pull off to the side, as the wings were not done yet. We waited only a short time before our wings came out hot and fresh. We were given a coupon for a free order of fries on our next visit, as a result of having to wait. They have offered a coupon every time we have had to wait, which cannot be said for other establishments. I would highly recommend the Mighty Wings and give high praise to my local Mickey D's for the fast, friendly service during the dinner rush.
5 Great crew, and super fast service. Bicyclist friendly too! This McDonald's is also the cleanest I've ever been in. If I lived closer, this would be my regular spot.
