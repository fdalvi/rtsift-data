2 We came in earlier in the night. We were the only table being served. My friend and I ordered home style spicy  braised beef  noodle, when it came out the noodles were way over cooked it was so soft. It was like eating a cup of noodle that has been sitting there for a while and soaked up all the water because it was bland.  Maybe I will try this place again hopefully it will be better. I know it is still new
4 Beautiful loungy atmosphere, fun Karaoke background music and an AWESOME Hot Pot soup. We ordered the Veggies & Seafood version and it was delicious! Medium spicy will knock your socks off, so beware. Will be back !

2 I did not like this place as they did not honor their yelp check in deal. They said we had to be outside a karaoke room to get the deal when we ordered the food. The beef stew noodles were sticky and weird tasting. The chicken wings tasted a bit burnt.   They had tons of Chinese song selections. So if you just want to sing that's perfect. Their English song selections was a bit lacking. I couldn't find many songs that they have at Que.
