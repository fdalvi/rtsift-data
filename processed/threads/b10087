1 First off, I'm disappointed in the staff...I walk in there and she doesn't even ask me what I need, she just stared at me until I actually called her over. Second, she charges me $15 just to fix a zipper, in my opinion, that's a ridiculous price to pay. Lastly, I never got a call back or anything to tell me it was done. I had to go in on my own and ask if it was done. Other places I've been to, I've always had a courtesy call if it's been there too long. But this lady, damn, she needs a hug or something.  Chances of me going back? Probably the last place I'ld go and only reason why I would go is because it's the closest one to my house.
1 We agree.  No personality at all and overpriced for the lack of service.
1 The lady who works here is rude, rude, rude.  I've been here twice and she doesn't acknowledge you when you walk through the door. Majority of the time when I pass by, there's always a giant pile of clothes on the counter. I don't know how or if they stay organized. Today, she scoffed at my husband for giving her a $20 bill. Seriously, with the attitude?!  I've been a little weary about this place because it looks like a dump from the outside, but the lousy customer service has ensured I won't return.
1 Employee there have no personality and are  rude. clothes are never done on time. I will never use them again. 8 other dry cleaners with in a mile radius. I am shocked they are still in Business. And they even have a tip jar really.
1 Went to pick up my blouse and had to have it redone because it wasn't cleaned properly. Went back to pick it up a few days later and was told they lost it! They offered to give me a credit for the value of the blouse.......uh, a credit won't help because I'm never going back there!
