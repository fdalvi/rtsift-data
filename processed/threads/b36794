5 I was very pleased with the laser hair removal service I received from Affordable Laser.  They were very professional and explained everything very clearly.    I had excellent results and it only took three treatments to take care of my underarm hair and hair on my legs.  I was told by the staff that may be because of my skin tone and the color of my hair but I was very fortunate.  No more razors!!  Yey!    I would highly recommend them to any of the services they offer.
