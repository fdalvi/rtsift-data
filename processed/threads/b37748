5 What a great experience from start to finish. When I was renting from another state, Jennifer and Angi were great every step of the way. I was given options, honesty, and amazing service. Initially the price was a bit high for my budget but then I rebudgetted. What really won me over on this property was the service of the staff. All my questions were answered, everyone treated me like a human, and even down to Jennifer finding sugar packets for me the first day. I've rented from Camden properties before so I know what to expect as far and trash collection and such, while it may be an inconvenience to some to pay a little more, I think it's done with the best intentions. Great location, property and apartment (I'm in love with my kitchen). Thank you all!!
1 The people in the leasing office are extremely rude and wouldn't help me at all I was really looking forward to viewing the property and now I won't be back!
