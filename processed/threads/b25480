5 A great car wash - best service I have got for a basic car wash.  I will be returning any time I am in the area
1 This is the only place that you have to request to have the whole car cleaned.  According to Ignacio Cluff, General Operations Manager they don't do the whole car including the trunk. This is from Ignacio, "We are happy to vacuum the trunk but unfortunately we only do it at the customers request. Many customers do not want us in their trunk."  I think the guy is a liar and if not you should know you should go to any number of places and they clean ALL of the car.  I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone.
1 All I wanted was for my car to be cleaned. First I get there and as one of the girls is vacuuming my cat she's looking at her phone. Second there's like 2 cars being cleaned, mines being the 3 and there's like 6 people. Lucky the older lady there was about the only one doing her job. She cleaned it and the girl who.from before was vacuuming my car starts to clean it again. Anyways I SPECIFICALLY asked for NO air fresheners. This guy comes up to my car and starts to spray air freshener. Ugh!! I was very frustrated and NEVER will I go there again. All because I didn't want to drive to my regular car wash
5 Basic $3 carwash. New facilities all modern and computerized. For previous negative reviews... If yoy want a full service car wash please go pay for it. Don't expect a $20 car wash for $3 and free vacuums.   I recommend it for basic on the go wash.
