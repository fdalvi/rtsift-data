5 Buy one get one sales... Men's sexiness happens here. Vests, slacks, dress shirt status. I'm in heaven
1 Tux rentals are pathetic. Go in 2 weeks before (at latest) for a fitting where you try on retail pieces. When picking up the tux 0-2 days prior, you get given a much lower quality with sleeves that are gathered at the seam to the shoulders yet the "only alterations ever made on rentals is length". Then how did the sleeves get that way since men's jackets never start with gathered seams? Why have to wait until it is too late to go elsewhere to buy or rent? At $235 I would expect more than an ill-fitting, dirty & needs pressing tux. There are places in town to buy a tux which would not be of much less quality than the rentals here. Will NOT be visiting any Men's Warehouse again.
4 Needed a last minute suit for an event and decided to try this Men's Warehouse.  The Manager, Jeffery Demoure, could not have been more helpful, he really went out of his way for me.  Was able to get a nice suit, tailored, in under 30 minutes.  I was very impressed.
