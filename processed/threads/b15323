1 I wish I could say something about the food served here, but unfortunately, I was never served food.  I walked in one afternoon and it was deader than disco. A cashier was counting money in a drawer, and a large amount of cash was visible. A cook was bumbling around in the kitchen area, moving things around and doing busy work. I stood at the counter for a good five minutes while the counting was occurring, not wanting to speak and possibly mess up this accounting operation. However, when the lady was done, she looked up at me, then turned and started doing other things.  I just walked out at this point.  Oh, and their customer service infrastructure is broken too -- I submitted a web form telling about my experience and never heard anything back. Maybe they should bring back Carl's Sr -- Junior doesn't seem to be up to the task.
2 Went to the drive thru on our way to Tucson. It was about 9 am, the guy could NOT get our order right! We had to repeat like 4-5 times, then when we got to the window he still had it wrong. Terrible.
4 Good- I came here for lunch and it was my first time at a carls jr. The day before, I had seen the nice buns commercial, so I thought I would give it a try. I walked in and was greeted fairly quickly. I said it was my first time and I asked for sine recommendations and the lady was helpful. I ended up choosing the original burger. My first bite was great, the burgers have this char on them that tastes like a home cookout. I didn't really notice the bun cuz it's wrapped in a paper. I just didn't like the super thick cut onions which made it difficult to eat.
