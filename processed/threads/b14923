3 Only need 1 form of ID for cashing non-member checks. Greeting was weak but overall friendly service for non-members.
5 I like this location. I'm always in and out very quickly. I have never waited more than 5 minutes to speak to a banker. I've never had a problem that they couldn't help me with.
4 Loyal customer and haven't had any problems with this bank
