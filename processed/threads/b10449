4 This little thrift store is tucked away in a Plaza and easy to miss! (next to toys r us)  For such a tiny store, it's loaded with cheap knick knacks, clothing, quilts, books and much more. Definitely a hidden little gem of a thrift shop that's worth a trip!
4 Friendly staff. AS Organized as they can be with the limited space.
