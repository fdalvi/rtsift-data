1 Disgusting rooms, filthy, mattress torn, carpet so dirty it smells, sofa collapsed on one side, toilet seat broken, residents dealing drugs from their rooms, prostitution rampant.  Stay away.
4 I booked this room.thru Expedia. I was on a budget, it was extremely affordable, $350 for 7 days. My room is spotless, I had a full kitchen..even though I don't cook,  I felt like I was at home. Comfy bed, cool A/C, clean linen, bathroom was ok. It was quite, peaceful at all times. Pool was clean too and it was close to everything. Highly recommended
3 Like a one bedroom. Quite. Cheap. Room are decent. Not fancy but has a full size fridge and stove with some plates. Clean. Sofa sleeper pulls out. Decent tv channels.
5 We stayed for a night and it was $54. They have a utensils, full stove, full fridge, microwave, toaster, coffee maker and a pull out couch and bedroom in every room. It's not the golden nugget but it's safe, its got free after conditioning and surprisingly pretty quiet. I'll definitely be staying here again when I'm back in Vegas :)
