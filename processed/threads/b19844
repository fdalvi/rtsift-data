4 I love the cosy, hidden away feel of St Vincent bar. I really do feel like it's been hidden away from me for some reason, and the only reason I learned of its merits was because my brother was participating in a Poker tournament here one evening, and so I came along to basically peek over his shoulder and embarrass him and put him off the game by asking stupid questions.  While I was there though, I thought, what the heck, I'll have myself a cheeky half pint (it was a Sunday, so I was winding down from the weekend) and take in the atmosphere. It was one of the pretty few and far between bars in Edinburgh where I felt completely comfortable and part of the banter within five minutes of being in the place.   St Vincent is frequented by a lot of regulars, but not the kind of regulars that put their pint glasses down and fix you with a steely stare in silence as you creak the pub door open, and then through which you inevitably awkwardly feel like you should creep back out of again.  All in all, this is relaxed and welcoming bar to attend of an evening, and if poker is your forte, you can play your heart out on a Sunday evening.
4 Vincents is the sort of place that makes me go weak at the knees. It's tucked away, it's small, it's cosy, it serves alcohol. After a particularly depressing day at work, I was treated to an impromptu gathering of lovely people at St. Vincent, and immediately felt better. So that's another to add to the list - healing properties for the soul. I'd dread to think what it was like on a busy night, but on this particular Friday evening, it was just perfect.
