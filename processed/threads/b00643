3 Unique? Not really. Central? I guess so. Every city has the essential queer store with loads of gay greeting cards, over priced candles and jewelry, novelty tees, and yes, porn, lube and toys. Oh the toys...It's a great place to get a quick gift for a fellow sistah. The greeting cards are fantastic. Lots of undies and swimwear (WAY overpriced!). And hordes of really bad clothing. Think tight mesh shirts with really bad pleather pants. What is this Fire Island 1979? All in all I like to support this type of store. Plus there's always the sleazy element of cruising. The tshirts are fun. Staff is helpful and friendly. They're always playing thumping, pulsating  dance music (poppers anyone?) that just makes me want to get more crap I don't need. Of course the CD they're playing is available for purchase...good trick....$36 later....YIKES. I have no will power.
4 Even though I can feel all the gay boys trying to figure me out when I come here, it's my go-to place for fabulous greeting cards, dry and sarcastic, with lots of emphasis on alcoholism and dysfunctional families. Perfect for me and mine.
