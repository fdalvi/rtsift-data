5 Great staff, live music every night, not stuck up or stuffy, not as expensive as some pubs on the Royal Mile. You could do a LOT worse in Edinburgh. Especially if the wankiness of George Street just isn't your thing...
4 I've got to echo the other reviewers here.  This seems a very laid back place to grab a bite or drink.  I stopped in here a few times on recent trips to Edinburgh and enjoyed it very much.  The meal I had was delicious (Steak & Ale Pie).  Someone else at the table tried out their Haggis.  I've got to say to my fellow North Americans, if you want to try Haggis, this wouldn't be a bad place to do so.  It was seasoned nicely.  They have several draft beers on offer as well as the substantial selection of Scotch whiskies you'd expect.   They also have live music which I believe the board said starts at 10pm although it may start earlier in the summer.  Others have marked the noise level here as loud but to my US standards I thought it was about average.  Even the live music was acoustic so it was a pleasant noise level and I could easily hear the conversation around me.  I like this place.  I like the friendly and fast staff and I also like the fact that it's just busy enough without being obnoxiously crowded.  If I'm ever back in Edinburgh, I'd definitely stop in again.
4 had many pints here during my 9 night stay in Edinburgh.  bar staff was very friendly and they have great selection of ales.  this pub is very popular with locals and tourist.  noise level is high, but in good way.  everyone was having fun.  tried the sea bass for dinner and i would say it was OK.  my friends enjoyed their meals more that i did.
1 You can't polish a 2urd.... This place has recently been refurbished, and I think they have done a good job of making it a prettier  bar. Logistically the counter is now at the back, so the entrance is more open and welcoming. Some nice big tables on either side, and the new d√©cor is what is best described as 'Traditional Trendy' random stag's heads and empty bottles of whisky adorn the walls.  It is still a very dark bar as the small windows struggle to get much light in.  Unfortunately, the service hasn't changed, nor have the 'tourist' based prices. I had a very bland espresso, obviously made from coffee which had been ground prior to the refurbishment as there was absolutely no crema whatsoever. What is the point in having a big fancy espresso machine if you don't know how to use it? Also had a pint of William's Bros Joker from the keg, not cask, which was flat.   I don't want to say anything more
