3 They don't have the most widest selection of items and some things are overpriced, but with pawn shops it is always a hit and miss. It is a small store but they have a variety of things that most pawn shops have. They do have a pretty good jewelry selection, not extensive but it seems like they take in quality items. It is usually pretty busy but they have enough staff to get you out of there in a decent amount of time. It's like my mom always says:  I wouldn't hit a dog in the *** with it.
2 Stopped in for fun. I'm not familiar with pawn shops but I was expecting items to be priced under retail. These items are used right? TVs and other electronics were the same price as brand new.  I'll pass...
2 This store does not have a large selection of items. Many are decent in quality. Would not even make an offer on a 14k white gold ring with a half carat diamond and 2/3 ctw in natural untreated blue sapphires. At least they were willing to look and were not rude about it.
4 Was in the area to do some antique shopping and ran across this pawn shop.  It has a nice variety of items....jewelry, golf clubs, music instruments, and audio equipment. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-pawn-chandler?select=Q0N5yjrlkqReDw_IEYUQmg#Q0N5yjrlkqReDw_IEYUQmg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-pawn-chandler?select=ZB-S6rqfjX3EB8MWFOG7WA#ZB-S6rqfjX3EB8MWFOG7WA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-pawn-chandler?select=E0ivWHONcAOcv_HCAvjC2w#E0ivWHONcAOcv_HCAvjC2w  I bought a Ping G5 driver for $65 and a Silver ring for $10.  Great prices for both.  When we walked in the store, we were greeted by two employees.  Sometimes finding help in pawn shops can be a bit challenging.  Good service at this one.  Return Factor - 80%
3 Ok I will let you in on a little secret, while some enjoy consignment stores, I like pawn shops, it amazes me the things people bring in, especially with today's day and age, it's not that hard to sell your unwanted items on CL.  I think my enjoyment of pawn stores happened when I was younger and would go to pawn stores with my grandpa who was always looking for the next big treasure find. I'm sure if he was around he would be one of the biggest repeat customers on Antiques Roadshow just to learn the item he paid 50 bucks for was in fact worth 10 haha but that's how my love of Pawn Shops started.  I had some time to waste and stopped into SuperPawn, yea sure they didn't have a lot of things, but this isn't a huge store, but what I did find was great customer service, super friendly and helpful with any questions that I had. I did see tvs, pcs, dvd's, video games, jewelry and some other random things.  I did wind up picking up a 22" flat screen tv for 70 bucks, its perfect size for the bedroom & Xbox . Wouldn't mind stopping by another time to see what they have in stock.
