5 Fabulous and professional. I love my color, extensions, and experience every time I'm here. Thank you :)
5 Tiffany & Kasadee are AmaZing! They cut and colored my best friend's, mothers and my hair for my wedding. I go to Tiffany all the time, but they were able to fit the 3 of us in days before my wedding. The cut and color on my mom was perfect, and she was able to make my hair even more beautiful than she had ever before for my special day. I cannot say enough good things about them!
5 I recently had an ombr√© done with Kasadee, and she's great! She was very friendly and made the experience very comfortable for me since I had never colored my hair before. The whole thing wasn't as expensive as I was expecting so that was definitely a plus. She did mention if I wanted to go blonder with the ends of my hair I had to wait a few weeks so it could settle, so when that time comes I'll definitely be back! :)
