5 I drove over 600 miles from Nor Cal on the advice of a friend - and would do it again  Great work, great prices and great people to work with  I highly recommend them!
5 Great job on redoing my center console at a great price.  It looks factory and not like someone redid it.  The price was fair and they did it in 24hrs.  Great service, great work, great prices...not much else to say.
5 They did fantastic work on my seats and doors for my 1976 Datsun 280Z. I sourced the parts and they put it all together. Everything came out wonderful! Family owned and run. Super friendly people. I plan on doing business with them again in the very near future.
5 Excellent work. Attention to detail. Great price.  Our 03 Honda Pilot (one star for that piece of junk), the leather seats were cracking and falling apart. At the dealer, it was over $3000 for new seat covers, plus installation. Took her on over to Bell Auto Upholstery and Manny Jr. came out, took a look, and told me to replace it with vinyl for 1/10 the cost. They found vinyl that nearly matches the existing leather and crafted new panels for the cracking leather ones and you would be very hard pressed to tell they are not 100% new.  And they did it all in one day. Amazing.  BAU is a family run business and it looks like the entire family works there, and enjoys what they do.  Can't recommend these guys enough.
