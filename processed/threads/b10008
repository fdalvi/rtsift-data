1 Slower than molasses. We ordered a four piece star chicken for our son. It took twenty minutes in the drive thru line just to get it. Good thing we didn't order anything else. This place is horrible. It's not like they're actually cooking anything inside... Don't understand why it's always consistently so slow.
4 First of all, go to Carl's JRs main website, and see if they have any coupons. Most of the time, they have buy one, get one (s).  It was dead when I pulled up to the drive thru. However, Alyssa, who took my order, was beyond sweet and helpful.  I ordered 2 $6 thickburgers, and yes, they are actually $6. No false advertising there.  3 chicken strips with honey mustard  Criss cut fries, and a small sweet potato fry.  Everything I had was fresh, (as fresh as it could be) I saw them drop it in the fryer.  When I got home, our burgers were nicely wrapped, forgive my sloppy picture, that is not CJs doing. The burger is the best that I have had from a fast food joint. Hands down.  The only complaint I have, which makes my review 4stars is the chicken tenders. They were very small. And when 3 of them is close to $4, I thought I would be getting a little bit more. Especially when some of the sweet potato and criss cut fries were the size of my palm.
