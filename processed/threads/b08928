5 Best dry cleaners in Scottsdale. Ask for Mike at the drive through. Tell him Stew sent you.
5 OK - a dry cleaner that: 1.)  Doesn't lose your stuff 2.)  Gives your dog "cleaner cookies" on every visit 3.)  Actually marks your spots and treats them; and then tells you if they can't get it out 4.)  Friendly!  While we have never been loyal to dry cleaners for very long, we have been Pat's customers for more than 7 years, mainly due to Mike.  He's great!  (And besides, when you want to catch up on sports, he is the guy - loves hockey, Cardinals Football and AZ teams - D-backs, Suns, etc.
5 Great dry cleaner -- quality work a friendly service.  Mike usually runs the counter and is very helpful.  The drive through is a big plus.
2 Unfortunately, only half my clothes were ready by the date they said would be ready. I would have been fine picking my stuff up anytime later. I was looking for a dependable place and thought i would try pats even though it was slightly out of my way. Unfortunately, i don't think I'll come back here.
4 So this place has a drive up window, Mike greets you by name, they offer next day service and oh, your clothes are done right!
1 So, I am looking for a dry cleaner and I call this place and ask the lady, can you please send me an email with your pricing.  She says she is new and cannot help but the Owner Can.  She asks and I can hear, "can we email a price list to this customer?"  And he says in the rudest voice I can imagin for someone that works with the public, "TELL HIM NO WE CAN'T"  If this was truly the owner, I cannot imagine someone talking to an employee this way, and not getting on the phone to find out how he can indeed help with my questions.  Unbelievable.  I spend approximately $200 per month on dry cleaning.
