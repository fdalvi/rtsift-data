5 I'll sum it up quickly:  the service is great, and the sandwiches are BOMB!!! (I'd suggest putting that cherry pepper relish on your sub for some extra kick.)  Ever since this location opened, I've wanted to try it out.  Been going back for a couple months now, and I love the place.  Their "Original Italian" is just delicious.  If you haven't been there yet, you gotta go!  You don't go there and pay five bucks for a limp sub that has you searching for meat.  At Jersey Mike's, it's a little pricier, but you get a big sandwich with big flavor, and there's plenty to share.  I also appreciate seeing smiling staff that you can actually hold a conversation with while they make your order.  That puts me in a good mood even after a long day at work.  Good food, good service.  I'll be back, and I'm bringing others with me!
5 Stopped in to check out the subs and they have won us over! Subway is trash compared to the higher quality ingredients, from the bread to meat. This is a very welcome addition to the Laveen area, food choices in the area are horrid, but this bring I some wonderful light!
4 best subs in town !
5 The sandwiches are great!  The menu used to be a lot bigger when I was kid and they also had a breakfast menu too.  I still think that they have the best sandwiches around!  Service is great and they get it out pretty fast even though they slice it for you as you wait.  I prefer the slicing it fresh over over sub-way's pre-cut stuff in a bucket.  I am a frequent flyer their.
5 YUMMO
4 Great food, but kinda steep on pricing. ($1/inch on subs.) Got 1 wrap and 2 regular sized subs for $22!
