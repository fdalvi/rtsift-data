5 Let me say that I worked at Violin Outlet from 1992 to 2005. It was a marvelous experience. I visited recently, and as always, I was impressed with Violin Outlet's constant updating to better help their customers. Mara, the owner, has been serving the Las Vegas community for more than 20 years.  She and her staff donate time, money, and expertise to support the fine arts of Las Vegas.  They also provide the most important thing besides their complete knowledge of bowed stringed instruments and music--honesty.  You will get a good deal on a great product,  and support after the sale or rental.  The repair shop has reasonable rates, fair appraisals, and quick turnaround time.  Don't hesitate--they will take care of you!
5 First time renting at this location. Fast friendly staff answered all my questions. Dolores was awesome!!! She tuned the viola, made sure everything was ok with it before I left. Got two months free as well as a free care kit.
5 I love this place. I've always found the staff cheerful and well informed.
5 I bought my violin here more than ten years ago and have made several visits since. The shop is small but cozy, the large amount of music books gives the place an atmosphere reminiscent to a library's. The staff are always friendly, very accommodating, and seem to genuinely care for the instruments that come through the door. It is always a pleasure to walk in and a comfort to know my old friend will be well cared for.
