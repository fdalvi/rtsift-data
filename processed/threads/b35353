5 Just moved into Vegas.. favorite Mexican food so far. Had the super nachos, fianc√© had the chicken burrito. Love how the cook comes out and asks how everything is. Good hospitality and food.
5 when with my wife for lunch.......alambre plate is deliciuos ,service is magnificent and very clean.....keep up the good work
4 Food was great so fresh and authentic. I bought the taco salad and my hubby got the alambre (not sure on the name) but it was delicious. The owner is great he came out and made us feel like family love love love will go again!
4 Stopped by to use my groupon & had no problems. Had the soft shell steak & chicken tacos, it was really good. The staff was super nice!! I will be back...
5 On my first visit, the man behind the counter gave me two free veggie tacos to sample!! Score for me. And yes, they were divine.  I'm not sure what kind of veggies were in the taco, but I know that there was cheese and the hot sauce.  After eating the free tacos, I immediately grabbed two more.    The set up is simple and clean. Obviously the customer service and food are wickedly good.  This is place is so sure of their food they gave me tacos to sample first.  Generosity gets me every time.   Anyways...I will have to visit this place again to explore more of the menu. I will be back for damn sure.
2 I just saw this place yesterday.  So i went today to try it, and what do u know!  CLOSED.  This location must be bad for tacos.
