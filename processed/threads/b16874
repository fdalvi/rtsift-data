3 Not one too tout to many retail outfits. I do want to express gratitude to this small family biz.   This place does without the fancy schmancy retail extras and is tucked away in a small plaza in the central NW. It is a finely tuned operation that is less about BLING and more about VALUE. The service received was personal and extremely specific. There was no high pressure sales, nor any snobbishness, not any rosewater scented sales people hovering over your every move.   Skip the malls and give some love for friendly neighborhood service and hospitality. Not will it save you money, you'll like owner and the service you receive. And they do on-site repairs as well.
4 The name says it all.  It literally is a small neighborhood jewellery store. The staff is always nice and friendly and the service is super quick. I take a few of my watches there to have batteries replaced about every 6 months. They do it right then and never takes more than 5 to 10 minutes.  Their jewelry selection is limited, but the service is great. If you are looking for repair or quick battery replacement, they have always done a great job for me.
5 I used to manage a store next to Frank and Roberto's place before it was the Neighborhood Jewelers. They have been my go to jewelers for 8 years. From our wedding rings to birthday, valentines day, mothers, and fathers day, etc. they are always fair, will customize and repair, and will work hard to get you what you want in the budget you have. I really don't see my family or I ever going to another Jeweler. These guys are really amazing.
