5 Great quality equipment and top notch trainers. If you need physical therapy or other sports performance needs, this is your place!
4 I worked with Jarrod S. following a knee injury for about 2 months of therapy.  He was very attentive and always extremely thorough in his explanations and reasoning behind the exercises we did on-site and that he suggested I continue to do at home.  The facility was always very clean and the staff did a great job of making me feel welcome.  Despite the vocalized opinions of another staff member (who I requested not treat me after that), I'd definitely recommend Orthosport for a positive therapy experience!
5 Amazing Physical Therapists and assistants! My main therapist, Jarrod Schechla, and his assistants have been extremely helpful in pushing me to get my strength back after my ACL reconstruction! The other PT's seem awesome as well. If you are in need of physical therapy and you are looking for a place that will help, push, support, and treat you with respect in a positive atmosphere then I highly recommend OrthoSport on Centennial Parkway!
