3 Fiesta Station in Henderson is the place for those wanting low-key bingo!  You won't find electronic boards here!   Sure, it's an old corner room on the 2nd floor that reeks of cigarette smoke that's embedded into the carpet and walls.  (There's a smoking and non-smoking section, but it's not separated by anything.)  The pace for number-calling is ideal for newbies who can't keep up with those bigger bingo joints in town.  Bingo packages range in price, depending on how many games you want to play.  They run sessions every odd hour from 9 am to 11 pm.  There's a soda fountain for self-service beverages too, along with a snack machine inside the room.  Free donuts are available at the 9 am session too!  There are cocktail waitresses taking drink orders if you need to get a little extra in your beverage.  Regulars are pretty helpful when they see you struggling with what games are next too!
4 Love it but it's so smoky you come out smelling like cigarettes!  Of course it's always more fun when you win too :)
