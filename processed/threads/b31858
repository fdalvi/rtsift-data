4 One of my favorites from Yelp's Sunset Showdown. Death's Door mixed up an awesome Washington Island Iced Tea (vodka, gin, whisky, Cointreau, lemon juice, coke, maybe simple syrup?). Strong, but went down easy and pretty tasty with all the fried/bbq food at the event. Would have liked to try their alcohol individually just on ice, but next time!
5 Tasted their gin,vodka and white whisky for the first time today. Their vodka would go great in a Moscow Mule. Put im sure they'll taste great in your favorite drink too. Go ask your bartender to mix a drink for you next time with Deaths Door Spirit in it. You'll be in for a great rest of your day.
4 I like Death's Door stuff. I really do.  Although it's easy for me to only think about GLD stuff - having an amazing distillery a stone's throw from my house? Ridiculous... - there are a few other good spirits that hail from our lovely Wisco... Death's Door being one of them.  I've always found their vodka to be clean, their gin to be round and delightful, and their white whisky? Well, I can't speak to that, cause I've not had it. (I'm sort of leery of clear whisk(e)ies. Not sure why... just doesn't seem right.)  At any rate, I think their gin may be my favorite. GLD gin is my absolute favorite, but Death's Door is super solid, too. Juniper, coriander, and fennel, w/out being transparent about it. It's nice and balanced and like I said, round. Approachable. Words that describe things that are good... add more of them here.  Though I've not physically been, four stars for a solid product that hails from my beloved Dairyland!
