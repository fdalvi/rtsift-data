4 It's a gas station so there isn't much to say, but in reality it is.  The pumps are new and very user friendly. Their store is always clean and fast. Never long lines or waits. The best part of the pump is that the receipts never get stuck and always come out easy to grab and read.  There is always window washer fluid and paper towels for the windows at the pumps.  This location can get a bit busy since there are two other gas stations around but this one is definitely the best value between the other two, always offering at least a ten cents savings compared to one of them.   If you are looking for a good spot on the east side of town for inexpensive gas then this definitely the place to go!
1 Pump 3 didn't work. Called attendant. In rude voice says: "nothing I can do for you, you paid outside."  I will avoid this place and take my business elsewhere.  There are plenty of gas stations that can give me better service.
3 Everyone needs gas, and the gas prices are a few cents cheaper than the station on the corner, just tricky to get to. Not the best area, but like I said everyone needs gas, so when I am in the area and need to fill up I stop here.
