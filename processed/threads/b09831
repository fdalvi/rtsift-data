1 I had a client's husband pass away so I called for Flower service. This place didnt even survive my inquiry phone call. Rude and immediately got the wrong feeling.
4 lady that worked in the shop was a little awkward to talk to but she was very helpful and put together a beautiful bouquet for a reasonable price. would recommend!
