5 I started going to Rejuvena since 2007, and regret that I have not wrote a review sooner. It was called something else at the time, but they still have the same WONDERFUL staff. I don't even use a primary care physician anymore, because I trust Dr. Jain with all of my medical concerns. Intentionally, I began going there for laser tattoo & hair removal, and eventually kept going for IV Nutrient & Detoxification Therapy. I have referred Dr. Jain to several friends who also see him regularly now. I believe in his practices so much that I even did a segment on Fox10 News. You can view the interview at this link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=3XPy8Vv6y1Q  I cannot go without mentioning the women of his office either. I have booked organic facials just so I could visit with Kimberly, who was my laser technician, and who I now consider a friend.  Sadly, I have moved from Arizona, but I will go back to Scottsdale for work. I will most certainly schedule office visits during those times.
5 I'm a figure competitor and personal trainer and have had great results with both myself and my clients with dr. Jain's food sensitivity alcat testing. no cookie cutter diets! Great fat loss results in record time!
