5 Everything is so delicious! The cakes are the best! Original flavors and decorations. Definitely coming back !
5 My cousin told me about this place.. she actually brought one of their cakes over to a party we were having and when I had a slice of it... it was to die for. It was so delicious that I had to go back and get my own cake. Haha. Flavors are on point and amazing.  I surely do recommend this bakery.
