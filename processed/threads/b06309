5 The place was really busy we I walk into it, but I was still greeted very nicely.  The staff was very friendly, and it was cool to be able to watch them make the ice cream.  I order Chocolate peanut butter cup in a to a go container, a lot of ice cream  :)  When I got home we put the ice cream into the freezer (had to go to the store after), and in a couple of hours we were enjoying very tasty, creamy, and very good ice cream.  We will be back for sure.
3 I hadn't heard of this place before I moved out here. Then a friend who was staying at the Cannery suggested that we go there after lunch. I thought that it was cute, the way the guy spread the ice cream on the slab and added the toppings, but there was nothing to "wow" me, unlike all of the kids who had their noses pressed up against the glass to watch. I guess that I can understand that. For the price, I thought that the ice cream would be better than it was, but it wasn't bad.  I give credit to whomever came up with this novel concept for an ice cream place (unless other ice cream slab places exist.)  I've never seen one, and I'm as old as the hills.
