4 How has this place not had a review yet?  It is also known as 'The Handymans Candy store' to some.  Being a new homeowner I wanted to check out this place as it came recommended by many people I know.  They have a huge selection of products that are insanely cheaper than their competitors.  I bought trim for the entire house at about half the cost of what I could get at Home Depot.  Yes, 1/2 the price.  We couldn't find a full selection of cabinets to redo our entire kitchen.  This place would be great for smaller projects like bathrooms or laundry rooms.  I wouldn't recommend it for a full kitchen remodel but you should definitely check it out regardless.  Great prices, helpful people and they are Minnesota Vikings fans.  SKOL, VIKINGS!
4 Great prices and they have everything you could want for a home remodel. I would have given this place 5 stars except for 2 things:  1. they charge 12% over the listed price. Didnt know that? Yeah, me neither. This is listed as their profit. OK, no big deal, it's still insanely cheaper than the big box stores. Still, would  have been nice to know ahead of time  2. No returns, you buy it, you better make sure it's right.   Still overall, they have great quality and prices
4 i stopped by multiple places today just to find a kitchen cabinet door.  Finally I found a single cabinet with the right door still on it here.  $40.  That's all I needed but the rest of the place had a huge selection of doors, windows, granite, etc.  I wish they sold appliances and more lighting fixtures.
4 Excellent place, this is a hidden jem. As a new home owner we have made several visits to this place. They charge 12% tax because it is "consignment" but the prices are still MUCH MUCH MUCH lower than your typical retail stores. We got brand new trim for the entire house (2600+ sq ft)  and the men who work there even helped us load it. They sell everything from cabinets, granite, toilets, faucets, doors doors doors, windows, sinks, etc.
