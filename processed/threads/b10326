5 Do you need granite counters? A new floor? Back splash? This place is worth a visit.  Super friendly greeting in an immaculate showroom. I want to look at some granite. I'm given a hard hat and escorted into the back.  Whenever I've looked at granite I am offered a few small samples. Not here. There is a warehouse full of huge slabs of granite & marble, carved straight out the mountain or quarry or wherever you grow granite, every color, every pattern ranging from fancy to really flipping fancy.   I think you need look no further!
5 Very friendly and knowledgeable staff! Made us feel welcome and comfortable...told us about the store and diff tiles then let us wander alone to browse. Didn't feel any pressure to buy and no salesman like attitude. They're selection was huge...almost too much to choose from. They let us take samples around the store to compare as well as take home. Placed and order with them and definietly wil be back for our next project!
5 An outstanding company to do business with.. We had a blast picking out our unique pieces of granite, the selection was overwhelming I wanted something different but also a granite that would compliment our decor, when I spotted the granite in the pics I posted I had a smile on my face that definitely confirmed to my hubby that I found our granite!!! I LOVE our new kitchen, wet bar & guest bathroom....hope all the pics show how truly beautiful this granite made our home look :) Thanks Arizona Tile  John & Kristine Termini
