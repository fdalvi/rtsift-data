5 Dr. Chau is fast, professional and kind. I have been going here for the past several years and have had nothing but excellent care. In fact I had a cleaning today and was in and out in 15 minutes.  The front desk is kind and I have never had any sort of insurance or billing problems.  If you are looking for a dentist give Dr. Chau a call.
5 Dr. Chau makes you feel like family!! I love the fact that when you are seen in her office you are greeted by your name, they don't make you feel like a number... You get excellent care and concern from Dr. Chau and her staff.  If you are seeking the type of care where everybody knows what's going on, and takes time to explain it you in great detail, look no further this is where you need to call!! Dr. Chau and  Amazing Smile staff are the best!!!   Big plus she has Saturday appointments....
5 My sister and I have been patients of Dr. Chau for over 6 years.  She's very fast and good at what she does.  My sister had her wisdom teeth removed by Dr. Chau without pain.   I also referred my friend to Dr. Chau for a root canal and she said that Dr. Chau was very gentle.   She said it was the best root canal she ever had.    We never have to wait more than 10 min to be seen.  Dr. Chau made it affordable to get our dental work done.  We are grateful that we found Dr. Chau. I refer all my friends to her.
5 Dr.  Trina Chau and her front office manager Linda  put the word amazing in Amazing Smiles. I have never had such fast and efficient work done before providing nothing but professionalism as well as that special  touch of knowing each and every one of their patients.  This office treats each client/patient like a family member not just a patient. I have been going here for about 6 years now and will never go anywhere else. this is my favorite dental office!
