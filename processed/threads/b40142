5 I have been buying John's toys for my grandchildren for the past 3 years. They are made to last a lifetime. These are toys that you can give your kids to play with then put on a shelf to display until the next set of kids come along to use them. My daughter is just thrilled with them and I am now sending train cars for Christmas and birthdays.
5 Are you kidding? Nothing, but nothing, compares to a horse by Fine Hardwood Toys For Your Children's Children. My daughters had ridden a wooden horse by Mr. Linck, so does my granddaughter. It is the same horse!   I buy Mr. Linck's train cars, supposedly for the next generation but I keep it for the past many years in my waiting room, and my clients, including adults, gleefully play with the train. Sometimes my wife comes to pull me away from the train. "Come on"  she says, ". . . we have a dinner date, and you are playing again with the train?" I tell her that I am organizing the waiting room. "Sure", she says. She does not believe me.
5 I have five children and have bought toys from Mr. Linck for all of them.  It started seven years ago when I bought our first son the wagon with blocks.  This toy has been used almost daily for seven years and it is still beautiful.  We are missing a few blocks, but it is fantastic.  Then came the click clack which is used so often too.  We have also bought many trains and have them on the shelf with the other toys.  The trains and blocks are the first toys that are reached for.  I have two year old triplets and I plan on adding more toys this year from the Fine Hardwood toys.  All the details are beautiful and they are very sturdy.  The wood ages beautifully.  All the toys are still in perfect condition, even with heavy use.  We love your toys.  Thank you so much for being a part of my little ones play!
