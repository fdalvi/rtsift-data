4 Banana Republic stocks lots of seasonal fruit and veg, much of it from East Lothian. They get their supplies in every day so it's always fresh. They sometimes get some exotic things in just for the kids to try. Dragon Fruit was just one of the strange fruit on offer. Their prices are so reasonable, it don't know how they do it. The shop is always busy, and it's great to see a nice greengrocer display on the high street. The staff are always cheery, even on the coldest day.
4 Greengrocers are few and far between nowadays.  The supermarkets are rapidly taking over their business, meaning that you'll be lucky to find one on a high street now.  Banana Republic in Portobello is one of the few that I've seen in the city.  I love the smell of greengrocers.  There's something about the smell of fresh fruit and vegetables that just can't be matched.  Although small, this place was packed with all sorts of fruit and veg, with a great deal on the pavement in front to tempt the passers by.  No doubt this place is facing stiff competition, and we'd do well to use places like this to stop the supermarkets taking over completely.
4 Great little fruit and veg shop in Portobello.  All sorts of healthy goodies here from the basics such as potatoes, onion and carrots to imported items such as blueberries and exotic fruits.  All the produce is laid out old fashioned style - eg. on the pavement so you pick what you want and then head inside to pay. There are also some more basic items inside too. It is a busy wee place, especially on a Saturday morning, but there is something gratifying about shopping 'local' or independent and selecting the veggies and fruits you will be using through the week.   I have always found that the fruits and veggies I have bought here have always lasted well if I store them correctly and prices are reasonable. As I don't live down here, I'm not here every week but I usually stock up when I'm meeting friends or doing a Findlay's run.
