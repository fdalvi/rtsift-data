4 Cafe 9 is a lovely wee cafe on Croall Place. The simple black and white exterior is continued inside, with the odd splash of artistic colour to brighten things up. The welcome is super friendly, they have free Wifi, and the food is very good, so it does amount to a very attractive offering.  Overall, we said: "I found Café 9 to be a very charming place, serving good quality grub. The amiable and diligent service was greatly appreciated, too. If you're looking for a friendly and tasty little lunch in Edinburgh, this is definitely one place to add to your list."
4 A nice little cafe with all-day breakfast.  It's fast, cheap and friendly. Two poached eggs on toast is £3.70 and a latte, while not exactly stunning, is a measly £2 flat. Perhaps a bit too 'clean' to be officially considered a greasy spoon.  ;-)
