4 If I need to sit down and talk to someone in the branch, this location and the one on Village Center are the ones I prefer. There is plenty of space and they have private dividers so other customers don't have to ability to be as nosy.  The location is convenient. There is a ATM inside or plenty of tellers on hand to help you inside.  I wish I could say more but that about sums it up lol.
4 I used to bank with Chase right after the WAMU merger.  I was not impressed.  There were a lot of bank charges and although the personnel were friendly I never got the feeling they were looking out for my interests.   That all changed recently when I opened a new account.  The staff was even friendlier than I remembered, the fees have been reduced and nearly eliminated, they have upgraded to scanning checks through your phone for deposit, ATM card overdraft notice so you can cover the overdraft before being charged a fee, and eliminated deposit envelopes through the ATM.    Sure there are still a few negatives such as the ATM doesn't give you a chance to pull back a check if a hold will be placed and I miss the custom atm cards at WF but overall I am very impressed with the new CHASE.
