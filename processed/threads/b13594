3 I have gotten good cuts from this place. I even took my bf and he was happy with his cut too. Why do I not give this place a higher score? Every time I try to return to a stylist here, they magically no longer work there, and I'm stuck trying to find somewhere else to go. That makes the score go from yay to ok.  The salon itself is nice. I like to walk in and have a cute done, which I can usually do without a problem. Once I had to wait awhile, and I got a free deep conditioning treatment and walked over next door to the salon and got my nails done.
4 Love this little salon. I generally walk-in for waxing and other services and 9 times out of 10, they take me in right away. The employees personable and friendly. The only thing I wish they would invest in is a table for brow waxing so my neck doesn't get cramped in the rinsing sink. Other than that, the store is very modern and clean, well maintained and comfortable. I will continue to be a customer!
5 I have been going to Vatoci hair salon for over a year now. I've had the same stylist from day one and I highly recommend her. I've never had so many compliments on my hair! Ask for Marsha (Mirushe) and I guarantee she'll take amazing care of you.   I love that she always remembers what we talk about and asks me about my job and my kids too. I am sure that Spiro and Vera also do a great job because the people who are in there when I am are regulars and everyone is always happy to be there.   My daughter loved going in to be pampered as well, and they are amazingly flexible on scheduling appointments even though they always seem to have plenty of customers. They know what they are doing. Highly recommend!
1 I can only rate the terrible customer service I received due to the fact that I was not allowed to reschedule. I purchased a Groupon to Vatoci because I'm new to the area looking for a new salon. I woke up sick, and called to reschedule my appointment. Rather than a callback, I received a text message stating I was not allowed to reschedule. So I spent $60 and received nothing for it. Who knows? I may have been a repeat customer, but instead they closed on that opportunity.
5 My husband needed to get in today and they were able to accommodate us, so I purchased the groupon available. His haircut from Spiro was fantastic. He was really nice. We will definitely be returning.
