5 Fast and friendly.
4 So, this last Sunday, I was at the gym working out.  And, then it hit me! "Uh Oh - it's Father's Day".  I knew we were going to have a huge BBQ, as we had family in from out of town.  I was in need of a card and a bag of my pops favorite candy; Orange Slices.  So, I made a quick stop at this CVS because it's on my way home from the gym.  I walk in and Tracie, who is running the front counter, smiled at me and gave me a quick "Hello!"  I walked over to the card section, which was extensive, and chose out a card.... well... more like grabbed a card and an envelope.  I'm a guy, and we don't go through the cards carefully looking for the right words that fit our feelings.... blah... blah... blah.  Anyhow, I grabbed a couple of bags of Orange Slices, which is way more important than the card to my father.  I get to the front and I had to wait for a couple of "Chatty Cathy's" to get through the line.  Man, they could talk and then having to wait for them to try and use their gift cards.  ETERNAL!!! But, I wasn't really in that big of a hurry, but it's still a little annoying.  They ended up paying in cash and left.  What took them 10 minutes - only took me 2.  Tracie said, "Thanks for coming in, Hun" and off I went.  So, I give CVS 4 stars... mainly because of the selection they had in Father's Day cards and Tracie.
