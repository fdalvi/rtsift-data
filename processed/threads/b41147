5 I love that they put a Jimmy John's at this corner. Finally can have my #12 Turkey Beach Club without driving 15 minutes. Not to mention we now have another delivery option besides pizza, yippee!!  These guys make sandwiches super fast and the ingredients are consistent and flavorful.  I'd never put cucumber on a sandwich but it comes on my Beach Club and I wouldn't eat it any other way. It's in a vacant NE corner but I'm sure it'll fill in now that there is a staple here. The place is brand new and only been open for 2 days but there is still 6 people in back kicking butt making wiches!  Love it
5 I like to order and pay online. It's ready when I get there 5 minutes later. The food always tastes fresh and the staff is always friendly.
