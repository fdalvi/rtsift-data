5 I followed Miss Rebecca from her former salon. I went in today and was pleasantly surprised and pleased by the salon. I was even more pleased that I received the best haircut and highlight job I've ever had. For years I refused to let anybody touch my hair because I'd always end up hating it and myself for paying. Not anymore. Rebecca will make an amazing addition to the salon! They are lucky to have her.
5 I really love how Rebecca cut and styled my hair. She is very talented and I highly recommend her. I will not be seeing anyone else for my hair!
5 Rebecca gave me a cut and color that totally transformed my appearance. She has a knack for doing a cut that really flatters. I have total confidence in her skill.
