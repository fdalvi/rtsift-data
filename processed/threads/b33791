5 I have gone to Cheri over 5 years and I have been receiving facials and waxing over 20 years.  Cheri is always on time!  Cheri has an energy that is peaceful and tranquil. Her methods and technique are beyond compare.
5 Cheri is absolutely the very best in her field I have had many facials with her.She is the only person I will let touch my skin! So very knowledgeable in everything she does! Cheri is always learning new techniques & only uses the very best products, including Young Livings oils. Wish I could afford to get a facial once a week! ! So proud of this beautiful Lady!!!!
5 I love oasis to zen and cheri!  Cheri truly cares about providing a wonderful experience for her clients. She takes the time to listen to your needs, problems areas and what you want for skin care. For instance, I wanted a very simple regimen that was natural and easy for me to follow. Cheri developed that for me and it's honestly the first regimen I've ever been able to stick to.   I also receive facials from Cheri and I kid-you-not people were saying the "you look different" line when they saw me. I couldn't believe it!   She takes such great care of me and is a hoot to be around :)   I have no problem driving to her location from summerlin. I think anyone that uses Cheri's service would not be disappointed.
