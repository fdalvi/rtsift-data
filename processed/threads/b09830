4 It's really really really dang nice to have a solid shoe repair guy right around the corner.  He's all business.  Brought in 4 pairs of shoes, including 3 heels and 1 boots with heels, all needing new heel thingies..  I paid $26 total and now can wear a bunch of shoes I haven't been able to in a couple years.  Score!
3 I recently scratched up my brown "pleather" boots by getting them caught in a doorway. I brought them here on a Friday hoping that they could save my beloved boots. After pre-paying the $10 fee, I returned the next Tuesday. I was disappointed in the outcome. The scratches were still very evident and the paint that they used to try to cover it was too dark and made it look worse. They did shine the boots though, so that made it look a little better. Overall, I probably would have been better off just saving my $10 and wearing the boots as they were or just buying a new pair ($80). I don't think it was necessarily their fault since I thought the boots may have been beyond repair, but I definitely left their store feeling really sad and like I wasted my money, which is not how I think one should feel leaving a business. 3 stars.
1 OMG I dropped off my $400 b macousky black bag for re-stitch the lining one week ago.  Came back 1 week to the day to pick it up.  they LOST IT.  $400 out.  $10 for repair and no bag.  Do not trade with these thieves.  Reported to police and BBB.  Do not trade shoe repair or anything with these people.  You might not get it back.  And they don't care if they go to small claims court.  So she, owner, said.
