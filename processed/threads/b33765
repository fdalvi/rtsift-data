1 Very rude receptionist. Exceptionally long wait time for a simple nurses visit. I will be finding a new office ASAP.
5 I've seen both physicians, Dr. Thift (female) and Dr. Nunez (male)... both are excellent.  They take the time to listen which is reassuring:) You can get bloodwork done at the office and don't have to go anywhere. Office is very clean and nurses are on top of things.
5 I've been coming here for about 2 years now.  I like all the gals  in the office! Rosa the nurse is real cool.   Dr. Nunez is awesome, sweet and explains what is wrong with you. He really cares which is lovely.    Dr. Thrift is so polite and  sweet too!  I really like how she listens.   I'm a flight attendant with a  strange schedule and they always get me in same day.  I highly recommend this team!
