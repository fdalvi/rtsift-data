5 Great place to learn.  This flight school has an owner that really cares.  He is very honest (which is hard to find in aviation).  I am sure you will be happy going here.
1 Be aware of the fact that they rent dry and you need to wait until Landmark gets around to fueling your aircraft after you return. I waited over 45 minutes to finally settle my bill!!
5 I am proud to be a flight instructor at Alliance Flight Schools! I came into the business with a strong flight background making me marketable to many flight training centers in Phoenix. I CHOSE to work for Alliance because of their incredible facilities, highly maintained equipment, and the integrity the organization brings to flight instruction. Qualities and characteristics which Cirrus has recognized naming Alliance Flight Schools the ONLY Cirrus Platinum Training Center in the State of Arizona.     I get to come to work and share my passion for aviation shoulder to shoulder with other professionals who share my values; Quality and Safety. For this reason I am proud to be a part of Alliance Flight Schools.
