5 Hands down one of the best family-owned and operated nail salons I've ever been to & I've been to nail school.  They are so nice & very accomodating.  Not to mention the work they do, definitely outstanding & their prices are so inexpensive for the quality of work.  Very clean, pleasing ambiance.  I love this place and come about every two weeks.  Definitely RECOMMEND!  :D Reservations are suggested.
5 I still love this place so much! GO!!!!
