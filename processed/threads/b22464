1 Management is rude and incompetent. They enjoy raising rent for no reason at all even if you have been a long time tennant with no complaints and have never been late once. They are wonderful at losing paperwork and demanding payments that you can prove you already made. Lets not mention that the place is unsafe.. I know of at least 4 break ins and attempted sexual assaults in the past 2 years i've lived at Whispering Ghettos.
1 Visited some friends at this dumpy massive apartment complex. Hey, let's slap a beautiful name on the aging complex and maybe nobody will notice everything else wrong with this place. Mostly, since I don't live here, things on the outside are a mess. There are giant potholes everywhere and the rainwater seems to never go away or it swamps the potholes forcing you to remember exactly where they are while you drive through a lake. The roadways are all cracked up and let's not forget an ungodly amount of speed bumps which in itself are in horrid shape. Three days after that storm, giant palm tree pods lay scattered everywhere as well. Somebody at the Whispering Pines is getting over on these poor tenants. I kinda wish I lived here just to sue their asses when I end up in a pothole. Somebody else should, but nobody cares because a dude wrote the same things in a 2011 review. Also a midday bonfire taking place at one of the BBQ grills looked real shady.
