4 great price..great service and a great haircut. That's all I was looking for and that's what I got.
2 I got my hair cut here one time, but that was enough to decide not to do it again.  The lady that cut my hair was super friendly, but that only goes so far. I gave her a picture of how I wanted my hair cut (don't judge me, it was a pic of George Clooney) and she cut all of my hair off. All of it. I almost lost my girlfriend that day because I went home looking like a creeper.  I wasn't happy with it, but I'm not the type of guy to flip out on someone and besides, the damage was done.  Adding insult to injury: she offered me a $2 off coupon for my next cut. Isn't that lovely?
1 I waited 45 minutes for my stylist.  I use that term loosely.  She was very unprofessional, chewing gum the whole time.  She washed my hair and matted it up.  My hair goes about halfway down my back and it was a matted mess when she was done with my 20 minute (!) wash.  It took her forever to come it out.  I showed her a picture and it turned out nothing like that.  She trimmed the ends and I asked for the last 1" to be textured.  She did not know what that meant.  When I said to layer the last 2" she cut one blunt layer in the back!  I asked for sideswept bangs and she cut bangs straight down my face at an angle.  It was a disaster.  She had been cutting hair for less than 1 year and should not be allowed to but women's hair! Or even wash for that matter.  Avoid this place and definitely  not worth the $35 I paid for it.
