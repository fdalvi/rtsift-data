5 I hate dentists.  I love the staff here.  That's enough for 5 stars right there.  But I'll elaborate a little.    The gal at the desk (Melissa or Michelle or something like it- ugh, i'm sorry) is also the manager and very friendly, even when I arrived for my first appointment a couple of minutes late.  The same goes for the hygienist.  Dr. Cambell is the dentist, and he's great.  All three of them were super friendly, cracked jokes, and didn't lecture me about not having been to the dentist in mumble-mumble years.  Then after my appointment when I mentioned wanting some cosmetic work done, all three of them labored to find a provider who accepted my insurance and would fit my needs.  Love it!
5 Thanks Yelp! I've been to 3 different dentists in this town and so far this place is my favorite. I like that it's a small operation (one dentist), and the staff is actually friendly and easy to deal with. My appointment started on time, they cleaned my teeth in a gentle and thorough manner, and the office is very nice.
5 My hygienist is Jen and I love her!  I had a root canal performed on Friday and can't say enough good things about Dr Campbell. I am a big baby when it comes to dental work, but he tried to make me as comfortable as possible.
5 I absolutely love Collin. He is an amazing dentist & a genuinely awesome person. He isn't out to rip you off; he is extremely real with you about what needs to be done & what can wait. If you are in need of the best dentist in Vegas, look no further! LOVE HIM!!!!
