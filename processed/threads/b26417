2 Service is slow. Waiting over 20 minutes to see a banker.
2 I hardly go inside this Chase location, but I do drive by once in a while to use the ATMs. Not too long ago, they added in a drive thru, which has a pretty annoying layout because you have to enter through an area that isn't right by the bank and actually looks like the exit. The first time I went to use it, I ended up driving in through the wrong direction and quickly reversed and went all the way around to use the drive through. It also seems to be taking up a lot more space than most other bank drive thrus I've seen. Luckily, this isn't the closest Chase to me, so I don't have to deal with all the traffic and annoying drive thru very often.
3 had to get a cashiers check.  There were three people behind hte tellers counter but only one window open.  the line of three people essentially was begging for them to open the other two.  The tellers were just chitchatting and that's what upset me.  I had to get a cashiers check with they did with ease, and actually waved the 8 dollar fee, so that was a plus that made it an even A-ok in my book.
