5 My experience with Jasper & Josephine Photography was a pleasure! My daughter was fussy and not in the mood for a photo shoot but Michelle managed to capture her adorable happy side.  The pictures I got were beautiful! I get so many compliments on them.  We'll be booking routine sessions with J&J.
5 Michelle is very professional and somehow always captures your best self. Her pictures are high quality and rival any photographer I've ever worked with. She's even better than my wedding photographer who I loved. I wish I knew of Michelle back then! Highly recommend, check out her website!
5 Michelle has followed us through our relationship from the very beginning. She took our very first picture together, engagements, wedding, anniversary, maternity, newborn, and family pictures. I keep coming back because her work and style are quality and she puts me at ease in front of the lens (a hard task). I have used other photographers, but Michelle just makes me want to smile for the camera!
