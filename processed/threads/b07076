2 As far as fast food is concerned, Taco Bell isn't all that bad.  I usually get two of the chicken soft taco frescos - they're lower in calories, and not terribly bad for the 'ole diet.  However... this location irks me for a number of reasons.  Allow me to recreate a few visits (all from the drive thru).  I only know the dates because I looked them up via online banking.  Visit on 9/14/12: TB: "What's up?" Me: "Excuse me?" TB: "Aw yeah - whatchya' need?" Me: "I'd like two chicken soft taco frescos?" TB: "Cool.  Cool.  What else?"  Visit on 10/2/12: TB: "Hey, how's it going?" Me: "Fine, thanks." TB: "What's new?" Me: "Um, can I place an order?" TB: "Sure you can."  Visit on 10/10/12: TB: "What's up?" Me: "Can I place an order?" TB: "You bet."  Never once have they greeted me with a, "Welcome to Taco Bell, may I take your order?"  I'm not sure why they're trying to be so hip/laid back/cool - it's a Taco Bell ferchristsakes.  I'm not buying a Billabong shirt or a surfboard - I'm ordering a dollar-something taco from a drive thru at 7:00pm on a Tuesday.    Knock off the casual crap and just process our orders, 'ya dig?
4 Standard tacobell everything was warm and tasted like it should. Was quick also, and the soda had the mix right.
5 Amazing Tacos! Try the taco 12 pack and mix the Doritos Locos Tacos with the regular. My favorite is the Double Decker Taco! MMMM!
4 I normally just use the drive thru. I always have a good and fast experience (except if the person in front of us orders 40 tacos). Person taking orders seems to be always pleasant and gets the order correct.
