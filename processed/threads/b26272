5 Reasonable price, all work done locally or on-site. Polite, and never a hassle. I bring in the craziest things: cargo pants with rips, elbows worn out of dress shirts that should be thrown away, missing buttons, frayed hems...they fix everything. Always good turn around. Convenient hours and location for me. If you want a textbook example of how to run a small business, this is it.
5 Very good service and reasonable rates!!
5 Good Day Cleaners is that quiet, reliable, responsible friend. There's nothing flashy about the place and the staff are normally quiet and just stick to the task at hand.   That isn't a problem because my dry cleaning is always perfect and quick (normally just a 2 day turn around at the most). It's pretty darn cheap and a great location for me since I live near the Smith's shopping center.
