3 I don't know what to say about this place really, it's kind of left me with mixed feelings.  I'll start with the bad for a change. I don't want to question somebody that's qualified to do something that I can't. But I got the impression that they didn't really know what to do with longer hair. I imagine most guys that go decide on a number between 2 and 5  and its done. I think the staff member was just mad that scissors had to be used to cut my hair. I didn't get a bad hair cut, but it wasn't great either.  The good, it's very close to the city centre and I didn't have to wait at all. It's also cheap, but then again what barbers isn't.  Good if you need something done quickly.
3 Used to visit here quite a lot but since then there have been several new hairdressers (Owners?) and they do not seem to offer the hot shave that I enjoyed so much when the turkish / armenian guy was still there. The girl hairdresser is well competent and very sweet if not a little patronising - as she offered me a sweety after being a 'good boy' when the haircut took place. You could tell it was done often as she had a big jar of the sugar treats!  However I did have a very good haircut, but next time i'd like to leave a place without feeling like a 12 yer old :o)
4 The new owners have had this place for over year now and Aleks (the male barber) always does a great job.  I always get a very short/bald fade and his blending is masterful and he takes his time.  The lady barber I have had less success with.
