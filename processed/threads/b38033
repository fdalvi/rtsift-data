3 After a bad experience with a different location, I came here because I was interested in a few properties. I went thru what my budget is, what I want and what im willing 2 compromise. The agent told me that if I spend more I get something better n more of what really like. I told her briefly what my experience was at the Mesa office n told her that im not willing to be mistreated again. I even told her show me what you have 4 me or don't waste each others time because im giving Valley King a 3rd chance. Needless 2 say .... Tempe office is a lot smaller than the Mesa office but my agent found me a place in my budget!!!!!!!!  I got my new home, moved in end of January.
2 Unless you want to be rush and sign a 12 month lease the same exact date, I wouldn't recommend. (Since your contract to the lease is how they get paid).Your better off using trulia or zillow since you can take your time and actual find a nice home that suits your needs.
5 My name is Justin. Valley King and especially mary and the gentleman that helped me saved my life literally. My wife walked out on me and left me with nothing but great credit. I had a past as well and a 55 pound dog which made it difficult to find a place. Finally after running around sweating and about to drop I ended up at Valley King tired and afraid I would have no home. My wife left me with no electric water etc etc...Greated at the door with smiles and a sense of professionalism the ladies were there to help me. Oh yea, they gave me a cold glass of water that helped me from passing out. Mary and her co-workers went to work and found me a home. I would recommend this place to anyone without it I would of been in a really bad spot. God Bless every one of you for helping me in my hour of need.
