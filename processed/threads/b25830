5 This is by far one of the nicest JCPs I have ever shopped in. Usually, I'll go to them for online shopping but this store is nice and the staff is super friendly and helpful it is a treat to walk around in. The manager was great to deal with too when it was time for our school fundraiser, he kindly donated a gift card for our prize drawing. The ladies in Sephora are always very helpful too, not pushy and make sure you pay attention to  their sales, sometimes they have GREAT deals on pricey makeup. Also, the jewelry department is great. For Christmas my husband bought me a necklace here that I get compliments on every time I wear it.
4 Yayyy! In August this store will have MANGO brand clothing! Awsome!!
3 The portrait studio is way too small for a bigger family and they do not edit your photos. You can get a great deal of photos though with online coupons.
