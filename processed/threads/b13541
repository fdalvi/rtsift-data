4 I have been shopping at this Safeway for a few months now, and its not so bad.  Since I have started shopping there since last summer, things have improved!  They did a remodel at the end of the year and it looks a lot better then it did before.  This store is an older Safeway...not the coolest or newest one I have been in, but nice enough that I like it and feel comfortable shopping here.  They have most everything you would need for one stop shopping..the usual Safeway Deli, meat counter, pharmacy and a nice selection of food and other stuff.  I gave it 4 stars becuase A) they recently remodeled and B) they have a clean store!
4 I ran into to buy some plants only.  The lady running the flowers/plants was so nice and helpful.  She told me which flowers just came in, which ones on sale, etc.  I picked out 4 plants and they were so vibrate in color.  To top it off, they were on sale.  Loved it!
4 I like this store. Most of the time they have something on sale or at a good price. I find that the meat selection is good and almost priced lower than Wal-Mart! They need to have more slabs of pork ribs. I have to go to Frys for that.
4 Not a bad supermarket.   I've shopped there and have walked out happy every time.
4 This Safeway is fantastic because it is open way past most grocery stores in the area. They usually have everything I need and their coupon policy is great! The lines are fast and the people are very nice! I always go there now, I refuse to go anywhere else.
3 Safeway is pricey. It is the Target of grocery stores. They have nice produce and meat, but you have to pay more then elsewhere. It does have self checkout and decent customer service. Its relatively clean inside and has a security guard outside.
