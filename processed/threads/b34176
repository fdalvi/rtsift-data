1 Silly, little spot of tents in a parking lot.  we were very disappointed, ended up eating at Sweet Tomatoes next door which was really good.
5 Great time for family and kids. Kids made great sand art. Wife got some great things and gifts for the family. Good little street fair for finding something to do on Sundays. Worth checking out.
2 Not much too see. Takes half hour max to see everything. Was very disappointed.
