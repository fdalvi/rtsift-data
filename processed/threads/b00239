4 We rented a van to move some furniture from Minneapolis to Madison (in one day) on a Sunday, and the only car rental places open on Sunday in the great city of Madison are the ones at the airport. (Uhaul was way too expensive!)  The polite man at the counter helped guide us to the best deal he could find and even let us cross that little old state line without paying a fee. We rented a van so new it only had 500 miles, it was clean, and it got us there and back.
4 Big plus: the baggage claim is RIGHT next to the rental car stations. WELL DONE MADISON.   Big minus: you have to walk to a giant, hard-to-navigate parking lot to find your car/rental company. Recall that 6 months out of the year the weather can be COLD.  Edge: friendly staff. Even though they sneak a cig on the walk from the desk to the lot. Gotta keep it real.
5 First time renting a car and the people behind the desk were great!  They helped us through the process, making sure we understood everything and they had great recommendations.  I will probably never be back, but if I did ever return to Madison, I would use Enterprise.
5 This is a shout-out to Matt & Ashley at this location.  They are awesome!!  On a super cold day when it was already dark & snowing, Matt completed my rental agreement, put on his coat, went outside to get my car & then drove it around so that I just had to hop in.   Ashley is also super nice & helpful, and was able to assist me with a larger car when I needed one.  I hope corporate is reading these reviews, because the Madison location of Enterprise is doing it correctly!  Thanks Matt & Ashley!
5 Thanks for making a great trip even better - quick, caring service and a free upgrade to a great Jeep Patriot that we really enjoyed. Enterprise is all I've used for years and I don't see myself ever changing. Rare that service in your business is this good.
