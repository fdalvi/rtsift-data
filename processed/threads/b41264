5 I recently got into a car accident and a friend of mine referred me to Marc and James. By far these guys are beyond professional! They have gone above and beyond to get the answers that I needed when it came to a response from the other party involved. They always provided me with excellent advice. Their team gave me peace of mind by knowing that I received the best care. I am very grateful to them and their legal team.
5 I met Marc & James through a dear friend after I was involved in an auto collision that occurred in a private parking lot. Even though mine wasn't a lucrative or overly complex case, I was very impressed by the attention they gave my case. They assisted me in gaining valuable information from photos taken at the scene, and communicated their findings to the other parties insurance company. I was in a tough situation, but couldn't have been more pleased with the outcome. I always felt that my situation was important to them, and I'd recommend them to anyone needing representation during one of life's difficult events.
5 I have worked with James and Marc for several years now. I own a business downtown and am very happy to have the top legal duo in Arizona to be able to turn to when I have questions. I have also referred multiple friends to James and Marc. We all echoed the same sentiments: that James and Marc are trustworthy, kind, professional.   If you ever need great legal counsel I highly recommend Lamber Goodnow to anyone.
