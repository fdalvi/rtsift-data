5 During the middle of July in 2013 our upstairs A/C went out.  At the time our son was only a couple months old.  Infinity Heating & Cooling was there the same day and helped repair our A/C in just a few hours.  We were offered a more cost effective solution that would be covered under our warranty but would take a few weeks to get in.  I loved the integrity of the service.  We decided to go to the more expensive option because waiting to have A/C was not an option in the middle of July in Las Vegas.  We have had Infinity Heating & Cooling come back to do preventative maintenance both on the home we owned in North Las Vegas and now at the home we rent in Henderson.  The service, integrity and friendliness of Infinity Heating & Cooling is a huge blessing to our family.  We will continue to turn to Infinity Heating & Cooling for all of our heating and cooling needs.
5 I recently had an issue with my motor in my attic; not only was the work completed fast, my whole system was inspected to ensure proper functionality of my cooling system. Having air conditioning in Las Vegas is imperative; I now feel confident my system is ready for the brutal summer months.
5 Richard and Cole are the best to handle any situation! They respond quick and make sure they fix the problem quick. They are very genuine and nice and are willing to go above and beyond to help.    Very fair pricing and extremely fast service. Would recommend to any one!!!! Happy customer!!! :)
5 Richard did a great job. No air, over 100 degrees, after six on a Friday right before a BBQ party planned for the next day at our house. Great timing right? We thought we were in big trouble, but Richard was here by 8 and had our air conditioner up and running by 8:30. Reasonable prices, nice guy, and great hours. Thank you Richard, you saved us!
