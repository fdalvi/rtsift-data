1 What is it with this place?  Since moving to the valley over 18 months ago my daughters have been enamored with this place.  Actually it is starting to wane, thank God.  How are these things all over the place?  Can't we make them get back to the mall food courts where they belong?  They are the McDonald's of Chinese food aren't they?  When I lived back east we didn't let these McChinese places get out of hand.    Valley residents have obviously not put them in their place in the scheme of things.  Bad Chinese food fast!
3 It's Panda. Obviously, there's better Chinese food out there. But for quick, Americanized Chinese fast food, Panda is pretty much king.
2 Ok, so it's Panda Express, just like every other Panda, but without the express part. I have never come here and not waited for them to have to make food. Forget about eating here is there is more than a couple of people in front of you.
