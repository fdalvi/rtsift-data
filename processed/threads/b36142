3 Got it on hotwire. Definitely more 3.5 stars than 4. The lobby was clean and "modern" though in an outdated way. Our phone in the room was broken and they charge an arm and a leg for internet, so you use it in the lobby (annoying). They do have a free printer in the lobby. And, most of the staff is nice and flexible. Rooms are kind of sparse but OK. Interesting to have separate toilet room.
5 Staff was friendly.  the rooms were small, but sufficient. It was clean and comfortable.   Breakfast was excellent and staff very friendly and helpful.  Internet and WiFi was free and powerful and reliable.  centrally located.  near the Edinburgh castle and downtown.  I would stay here again and again!.
