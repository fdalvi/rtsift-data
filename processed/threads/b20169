5 The Old Waverley Hotel is conveniently situated on Princes Street, just across and down a bit from the Waverley train station, around the corner from the pubs on Rose Street on the edge of New Town, and facing Edinburgh Castle and Old Town just a quick jaunt away.  The hotel is historic, and you immediately feel the old world charm as you walk in. Check in at the front desk on the plush carpeted floors, and you'll notice the bar ready to quench the thirst of you weary travelers. Plenty of scotch whiskeys on hand, as well as British beers such as the English Boddington's or the Irish Guinness, but you're in Scotland - have a Tennent's. The bar's seating area is comfortable with high backed chairs, and a door connects it to the restaurant, Cranston's, where they'll serve traditional Scottish breakfasts, or lemon-battered fish and chips, or elegant three-course dinners for £25.  I was in northern England on business, so Edinburgh was a rough halfway point for me to meet a friend working in Aberdeen. She was catching a flight on Saturday, so we got a fairly inexpensive room for the night at just 35 pounds apiece - though there are pricier rooms for the luxuriant travelers. It was cozy and comfortable, with porthole windows that looked out on the gardens and the Sir Walter Scott memorial below.  The Old Waverley Hotel makes for an exquisite stay in beautiful Edinburgh, and one central to all the sights and sounds. Brilliant!
4 You can't really fault this place for location. It's secondary to none, and is the basis of my 4* review! As a tourist this is probably the best place to stay in the city. It's right in the middle of Princes Street and has brilliant views of the castle and the city gardens. The hotel itself doesn't look like much, but don't judge a book by its cover. Up some stairs (or elevator, whatever) and you are in the Waverly! It's nice enough, really traditional and still has a Scottish twist.  As highlighted before me, the prices are brilliant too. So overall, for your value for money and location, you can't really go wrong!
3 My parents and I chose to stay at this hotel just before I moved into university accommodation, as it's extremely central, being situated on Princes Street.  The decor also looked quite rich and characterful, and when we arrived, we weren't at all disappointed. The hotel is very nicely presented! However, we came with a lot of luggage and the staff weren't that helpful in helping us lug them up the stairs to reception.   We felt lucky to be placed in a top floor room overlooking Princes Street, especially as most of the sound could be blocked out by closing the windows. However, the bagpipes were NOT blocked out and promptly woke us up every morning around 9! I'm ashamed to say I had murderous thoughts of sniping the fellow just to get some shuteye, and have since lost any affection for the bagpipe I may have had.  The hotel is reasonably priced for it's location, but it did seems it was just a few adjustments away from being a real luxury hotel. Just make sure your hotel room is facing AWAY from Princes Street..that my warning!
3 I hope to age as gracefully as the Old Waverley Hotel. Not that I want to live to be over 150 years old, but it's in remarkable shape, all things considered.  Beyond having a rich history, I thoroughly enjoyed the creaky, tilted central stairs, the free high-speed wi-fi throughout the property, and especially the spectacular views from my room of Scott Monument and the Edinburgh Castle.   They do, however, need to reconsider the furniture configuration in the rooms: there's no room to fit a chair under the work desk because the bed is simply too close. In order to work, I ended up having to straddle the edge of the desk. That's -not- an attractive look, let me tell you.  Also, kudos to the exceptionally efficient staff at the front desk. They may be brusque, but they will get you checked in/out in record time!  That's kind of how this hotel goes: it may not be glitzy, glamorous, or the newest, shiniest hotshot on the block... but it'll get the job done. Like 'wham, bam, thank ya ma'am' done. And that, good readers, is a respectable thing indeed.
5 Not sure what to fault.  As others have noted, the location is brilliant.  If you are coming in by train, this is a dream.  It is rightadjacentto the principal attractions, I.e. The castle.  The service is friendly, the rooms are surprisingly spacious.  The decor is upscale though not ostentatious and the prices reasonable.  You may not wow your friends but this is a quality place at a fair price in a perfect location.
3 Lovely hotel set in the heart of Edinburgh.  Princes Street is so close to everything and anything you wish to do is just on your door step.  The staff are very friendly and accommodating and the rooms are clean and comfortable.  As Princes Street is one of the main thorough fairs of Edinburgh if you are a light sleeper - ear plugs would be a necessity!
4 Edinburgh: "They have a nice castle."  This is where to stay to see it.   Location: it's within a stone's throw from the train station, across the street from the Sir Walter Scott Monument.  The Hop On/Off buses line up across the street by the station.  Sainsbury's is around the corner (make friends with that store--it's a traveler's companion).  High Street is just a walk up a steep hill where all the action is.  I could see the majestic castle from our window, shrouded in the regal, romantic rains of Edinburgh.  We did hear street traffic and crowds at night, and the mournful bagpiper at 9 a.m., but it was okay. (Too hung over to care.  Might have wanted my Enfield for the bagpiper if sober.)   Cleanliness: an excellent staff kept our room very tidy.   Decor: pleasantly outfitted with modern furniture but with a slightly old world feel.   Internet access:  they offer it free, but it is not always dependable.  They offer faster, better Wifi for a price.  See front desk for pay rates.  I was very happy when it was working for free.   Access: You'll need to be able to climb a flight of  stairs to get up to the front desk.  Then up 3 more steps to get to the WEE, SLOW elevator.  If someone in your party is disabled or looks like Fat Bastard from " The Spy Who Shagged Me," this may pose a problem.    Staff: efficient, friendly.  Just the best.   Facilities: They've a lovely lounge in there, and a restaurant, the Cranston.  Didn't try the lounge, but the restaurant was very nice.  Scottish breakfasts complete with potatoes, haggis, and black sausage.  The 25 pound dinners were very elegant--loved the rack of lamb.   Price: I thought it was reasonable for what they offered.   Weather: It was August, but people were wearing coats and sweaters like it was winter.  I ended up really liking the cool, brisk, mild climate since it's perfect for all the walking you're going to be doing.  But when it rained, it sucked . . . sucked . . . sucked.  The relentless moisture clings to you like a stray dog humping your leg that you can't shake off.  The only remedy is to drink a couple pints of Guinness and hope it goes away.  Dress appropriately for rain and shine.     synopsis: it's a nice hotel, great location, with a great staff.  Enjoy.

4 This is the place to stay if you want to walk everywhere...and never mind the construction on Prince Street it is their equivalent of Boston's Big Dig, it's not going to end soon.  Think old hotel...retrofitted with tiny elevator, winding hall ways.  Remember to get a room facing Prince Street or otherwise don't spend anytime in your room.  Don't spend any time in your room anyway...just go out and enjoy the city.
4 I stayed here for six nights while touring Scotland.  It was very basic but nice.  Just off the train station which made getting into the city/out of really easy.    It was walking distance to everything in the city and a great rate for the time we were there.  It was worth the price as we hardly spent any time in the room.
3 Situated near to transport hubs for buses, trains and eventually trams! The hotel is neatly tucked between businesses on the shopping mile. When you go wandering up a winding beautifully decorated staircase to reception to find their bar or foodie venue, listen for the distant sound of the lone ghost piper.  At the bar discover beers around £4, and ample selection of whiskies, liquor and all sorts of beverages to satisfy any palette. I thought the bar has a cosy pre-theatre venue feel to it. Good start if your going to the nearby Playhouse or Festival Theatre each less than 10 minutes walk.  From velvet curtains, large armchairs and prints of Ye' old town adorning the walls the sparklers in your cocktail completes the mood. Ambient lighting in the right places with corners to snuggle into, mixed background music playing instrumental doh-whop jazz, or Scottish sounds in abundance will make any visitor to Edina feel welcome.  I heard the bar food is to try, but with half hour left for serving, maybe next time. If you find yourself sitting at the back or to the left of bar, then look out the windows. You will get a grand view of the touristy Walter Scott Monument, or to some, the large spiky thing on Princes Street East. This is also the area where you also might glimpse a real live Scotsman playing his pipes, sticking out of a bag; that some say the noise created is used to attract and capture haggis in the highlands?  Great chat with bar staff, who are friendly and know their stuff around the alcoholic chemicals. Since Waverley didn't have any Innes&Gunn I almost tried another dark bottled beer name Edinburgh Ale, but what was off putting was the price for half a pint. So thought I'd indulge into a pint of the amber nectar instead. In all nice drink and half hour chill out time. I didn't stay here though as just passing through!  The haggis smelt nice also, thanks to the pipers of Scotland!?
4 Tis was the time for the Last Elite Event of the year and the Old Waverly Hotel had the glittberball spinning!  It's a beautiful ballroom.  It has the features that alot of hotel don't.  1. Kept the cornice on the ceiling.  2. a stunning view of prices st gardens and the castle!  The buffet was delicious and the macarons were pretty awesome too!  Scones were pretty tasty too although I like mine Big!  Staff were friendly too.
4 I have never been in The Old Waveley before and it was actually a very nice establishment for a function. Very Central...infact i dont think you could get a better location. Nice and Bright. I must try afternoon tea here sometime!
