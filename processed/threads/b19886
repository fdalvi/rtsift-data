4 I've only been to Cafe Habana once and it was en route to the Club Below Stairs which is further down Leith Walk.  The pub feels fresh and lively inside with quite loud music, modern decor and plenty of customers.  The service is quite fast and friendly and the bar is laid out in such a way that you which drinks are available and how much they cost.  The drink prices are as you would expect with £1.90 bottles of beer and £3 for a double spirit and mixer.  We just stopped off for one drink to send us on our way and we left impressed by the pub's atmosphere and lay out. Situated right opposite the Omni Centre and Edinburgh Playhouse, Cafe Habana would be an ideal place to go for a drink after a performance or before going on to Mood.  Further, it does plenty of its own entertainment with big screens showing sporting events and it even does its own karaoke night.   Cafe Habana, although not the cheapest pub, is in an excellent location and has something to suit just about everyone.
4 I tend to go here on the quiter nights Which is usually a Sunday. If you like wild partys with no room to move go on a Friday or a Saturday by all means. This palce sells brilaint pints with some of the best beers.
4 I popped in here with my partner on our anniversary tour of Scotland. Honestly - it is the friendliest pub we have been to so far in Edinburgh.   We were early on a Saturday night and stopped in b/c I had recognized it from searching gay friendly pubs online. We were very pleased with the bartenders and beer prices and will stop back in before we leave the country.   Good mix of people and age groups - friendly staff, good atmosphere. Really good time (minus the one Really drunk guy  - but that happens)
