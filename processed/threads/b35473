5 I highly recommend Dr Reed  and Insights for Life.  I have used several of her services and attended several of her classes. Dr Reed is very professional and connects on all levels.
5 I initially went to see Dr. Martha for weight loss, but ended up finding a great center that helps you from the inside out. Her office is a great place to get back on track mentally and physically. Not only did I lose 50lbs in 3 months, but I have gone to some great workshops and even a fabulous trip to Maui. Do yourself a favor and book and appointment with her. Check out her website she has a lot to offer and I am sure you will not be sorry.
5 I have seen Martha several times with my mom and she really changes not only how you think and feel but your wellbeing too.  Such a great energy to be around!
5 I have been working with Martha Reed and the Insights staff for a couple years now.  I find them to be some of the most patient and genuine people I have found on this planet.  The Doctor really cares about your results, whatever you want them to be. I have been helped with weight loss, aura cleansing, releasing limiting beliefs, and all in all confidence creation in myself and my abilities/gifts.
5 I've visited Martha Reed several times over the last year and found her tremendously helpful! She is intuitive and insightful, helping me navigate through challenges as well as unlock my potential and really blossom! I highly recommend Dr. Martha, you will not regret it!
