5 I seldom write reviews for retail stores, but my experience shopping at this Ferragamo was so pleasant and great that I really want to leave the praise they deserve.  While this store is not as big as the flagship stores I typically visit in Beverly Hills and NYC, the selection is complete enough that you will still find the staples you need. Want something not in the store? The staff would be glad to order and ship to you - for free of course. I picked up a few ties, and some beautiful red pumps for mom. Those pumps were quite a mission as it turned out, as I ended up having to exchange for a special size that they had to order from a store in Hawaii, and then ship to California for my mom.  A special shout out to Andrea and Anne for all their help and dedication!
5 Came to Vegas for vacation and walking around, I felt my Jordan's were a bit uncomfortable so I wanted to buy some suede shoes.  Jiaru Song was very helpful, bringing all the different sizes from the back for me and it was an easy purchase.  If I'm back in Vegas, I'll probably purchase from here again.
