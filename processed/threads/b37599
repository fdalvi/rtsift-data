2 I had lunch there on 1/17 with my friend. She ordered the brusslesprout salad and I had the green chili burger. Her salad was beautiful and tasty, but over priced for it's size. My burger was cooked well done, too well for my liking, the toasted bun crumbled when I bit into it and all the toppings, cheddar cheese, roasted green chili and aioli made it very messy to eat. I ended up using a knife and fork. The fries were perfect! Very skinny and crispy, I could have ate a basket of those.  Our server was pleasant. We told her we didn't have a lot of time and luckily they weren't busy at that time, so our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. However, we had to ask for tea refills.  The atmosphere was nice and roomy and I was nicely greeted when I walked up to the hostess stand.  One last negative, I really wanted to order the ahi tacos, but they had just ran out and it was 2:30 in the afternoon on a Thursday, a little disappointing.
4 We had the Filet Mignon and the Swordfish Tacos and they both were fantastic.  Highly recommended!  This is no ordinary airport restaurant.  And I'd almost give Five stars but felt that our server was too aggressive in trying to oversell everything (i.e. "want a double" "sure you don't want a double", "chips and guacamole").  and the bathroom is a quite a walk away..and our hot sauce lid was broken in half, which to me mean it found itself on the floor, and our server touched my tortillas up against the condiment tray which i thought was a little gross.....but all that aside, this was a A+ experience.
