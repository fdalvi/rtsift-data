4 I live at the bar! Thursday night is very busy and it brings in a crowd that is not normally there on any other night of the week. But it's still a lot of fun and they have very good drink specials. Just recently they have started punk rock night on Sundays starting at 10:00 pm. Shane Terrell, owner of Imperial Tattoo DJ's until closing.   Also since football has started, the bar has started serving breakfast in the mornings for all the football fans.   The food is good, the people are fun and it's just an all around great local bar!
3 Not a bad place to do some swashbuckling, seems to be a lot of "bro's" some nights of the week. over all it's cool joint. I've had a lot of intersting times here.
1 This place has actually been closed for a while. It was nice while it lasted.
