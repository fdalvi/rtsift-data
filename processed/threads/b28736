5 Cheapest gas prices in town!!  A couple of weeks ago I paid $2.49/gallon.  Yesterday it was $2.59 when most places are over $2.60 or even to $2.77!  The clerk was real nice, too.
4 4 stars for gas prices  3 stars for pump/ terminal upkeep: 1/2 the time the terminals wont accept any cards, you cant use them inside, and weve has pump #1 overflow on us more than once.  1 star for customer service: I will only ever buy gas here. The people that work here are horribly rude.
1 Dateline: 21st Century.  A driver swings by a gas station right off the 101, pulls up to the pump, whips out his credit card, and buys some gas.  Oh, wait, no.  That's not how it went.  A driver swings by a gas station right off the 101, pulls up to the pump, whips out his credit card, and is confused how in the hell a gas station these days doesn't take freaking plastic.  Seriously, this place doesn't take credit cards.  Most ARCO stations don't, apparently (though BP, their parent company, does).  I know they say it's to save money on fees to card companies so they can pass on the savings, but come on.  Plus, they charge you to use a debit card with a PIN.  Unless you have cash, this place is going to be a wash on most gas purchases.  With most purchases these days going onto cards (or run through a debit system), it's time for this freaking place to join the 21st Century.  To add insult to injury, this particular location is kinda dumpy.  It's not worth their alleged savings (you can usually find the same price on gas elsewhere nearby).  Don't bother.
