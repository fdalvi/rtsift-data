5 Good work, completed when promised at the agreed price.  What more could youask for in a mechanic?
3 One of a two-part review... I have an '05 CBR600RR, in a complete state of disrepair. I called Cycle Tech, David was who answered, call dropped(thanks AT&T), he called me right back. This was 10 am Tuesday 19 June 2012, I told him what all was wrong with it and he said to bring it in. He even offered to pick it up from 15 miles away. I got to his shop at noon, he went right to work on an estimate and before 12:30 I was leaving my bike with him. If you've ever had someone act like they're not interested in your business, I suggest you try Cycle Tech. When I saw the dozens of bikes in his shop he was working on, I realized how important MY project is to him. He dropped everything to get it written up and ready to go. This bike needs a lot of attention, and he said he should have it ready "in a couple days". Watch for a post-repair review.
5 I called Thursday 21 June at 5:45 and David had it ready. It's incredible he got it all done within the "couple days" as suggested. I'm picking it up this morning and will write a follow-up after I peel myself off it!    OK, he did a few things unexpected. The turn signal switch was "sticky", as well as the brake light switch. He must have cleaned them as they work just like new now. As for the other issues, tires- take-offs but of very good quality and excellent condition. Brakes- all three sets EBC, final drive- DID 520 and sprockets front and rear. Oil change- Royal Purple synthetic and Hiflo filter. Fork seals- replaced as well as fork oil. All told I am VERY happy with Cycle Techs work, and the pricing was well below any dealer would dream of. Not to mention this all was completed in an amazing two days! Thank you David, and Cycle Tech. Give them a shot, you won't be disappointed.
5 Great work as always and the prices too. Dave is always top knotch in getting things done for you in the time frame promised.
