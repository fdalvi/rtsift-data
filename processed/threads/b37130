4 I'm not exactly sure when this location first opened, but some co-workers and I recently headed over to check out the Denny's at Neonopolis. In reality, I'm not a big fan of Denny's, but thought it'd be fun and kitschy.  The Good  It is the nicest, cleanest Denny's that I have ever been in. They have a full bar, which seems interesting for a Denny's, but then again, it's on Fremont Street and that makes sense. I can't comment on the bar because we went for lunch during the work week.  ('Nuff said.)   The restaurant has a photo booth that's Vegas-themed (NEAT); the kind where there's an outline for your head, you stand there, take the picture, and you'll come out with Elvis hair or whatnot. But the camera is kinda high, so if you're a scrimp like me (5' 1" or shorter), the camera is too high. Sadly, my head didn't reach the outline, and there was no stool or anything like that.  We all had the french toast special, which was cheap ($6-7) and decent (or at least the french toast was; the sausage  . . . well, we won't talk about that). Our waitress told us that they're opening a wedding chapel (or already did), and there was a celebrity wedding already lined up for February. (At least we're already in Vegas for betting purposes.)    The Bad  My group was seated in a booth adjacent to another booth, with some artsy-geometric bars as a separator from the head-up. As we were paying the bill, another co-worker and I turned around in the booth, and noticed a dude's head literally peering over our shoulders through the bars. Apparently, he was looking to see if we were done with our food. Kinda caught us off guard a bit.     The Ugly  It's still Denny's food. Okay / decent, but not great by any means. The general group consensus was that Denny's is a place to end up.  Overall  So why the four stars? Location, location, location! It's Denny's on Fremont, so it's worth checking out for that reason alone. Also, this restaurant has an outside patio, which will be a fun spot to people watch in the summertime, and offers uncommon Denny's menu items like flatbread.
2 We went there on NY weekend Saturday. The hostess was friendly, lots of smiles here, and asked if we were okay sitting a table in the back. We asked for a booth and were placed at one of those 2 person booths, kind of a squeeze. Our menus banged on the condiments. We ordered two draft beers, and they were flat so we told them right away, then ordered other ones and they were flat, too. Kindly, they only charged us for the second set of flat beers!  We ordered cups of chili, but they did not come. Our entrees arrived. I asked about the chili and our server said she was sorry. She said she was so preoccupied with the beer situation that she forgot. The burgers were of good size. We found gristle in each one, and my wife found a bone in hers, but I guess that's par for the course for economy burgers these days, isn't it? The porter who delivered the burgers asked if we wanted hot sauce, then came back with a bottle with about 3 shakes left in it. "Is that okay?" he asked. If your server asks if something is okay, he/she knows the answer!  The fries were pretty good, though some of mine were under-cooked and they don't have malt vinegar. The capper was the bill. You have to write down your tip prior to the waitress processing the card. She became much more officious when she discovered she received a mere 15% tip. I noticed other people sending back food that was missing little things, like the toppings they ordered on their specialty pancakes. I would recommend giving this Denny's time to figure out it's issues. Eat is great and down the street, and Hennessy's is across the street and has a great burger. Both have better food for roughly the same price. This place may be great once Denny's closes and something else opens up in it's place!
4 This Denny's is the best looking,friendly,and cleanest I have ever been in,there is a bar with about four flat screen TV. tables and stools that seats about 20 to 25 people,the deco in the bar area is very stylish,also they serve there frozen drinks too this is strange they have a place inside that says photo booth that you can take pictures, outside I can see but inside I don't see,try the blooded mary garnish with celery /lime and strip of bacon and side car of horse relish $6,00 so forget the food come here for the bar,its also a great place to people watch with an enclosed patio,I did eat breakfast here before I hit 15 SB
5 I was really impressed with this Denny's. The entire experience was perfect. The host, tony, was really friendly. Our server, Rebecca, was super nice, and quick, and stayed on top of things. The music was enjoyable, the chairs and tables were very contemporary, instead of the typical Denny's diner type booths...   I got my free birthday breakfast, which was awesome. I was also able to have a fricken Bloody Mary, because they have a full bar! I was happy to go to Denny's and look through the menu and see that they didn't jack up their prices because they knew they could. The menu prices were the same as any Denny's anywhere, and I think that was awesome.   I will absolutely be back. Of course, because I'm obese as f*ck. :D
2 Went in on a Saturday morning at 10:50 AM.  The girl in the front said she was going to clean a table and seat us. This was said in front of her co-worker, who reassured us that our table would be ready in a few minutes.  About a minute later he decides to try and seat us at the bar, even though our table is ready. We explain that we would rather sit at the table instead.  Our waitress was pleasant and took our order at 10:55 AM.  Drinks were brought out quickly, but there was no silverware or napkins on the table. At 11:15 AM our waitress comes to the table to inform us that the computer "lost" our order and she needed to write it down again. She was very apologetic. At 11:25 AM she came back again and said the food would be out shortly, there were a few orders ahead of ours. At 11:30 AM I called the Manager over to explain that we had been now waiting 35 minutes for 2 omelettes and still had not received the food and at this point was ready to pay for our beverages and leave. He apologized and said the food would be right out. Fast forward another 5 minutes and we were finally served, but had to point out that we still had no silverware.  Again, the waitress was very apologetic and took the beverages (1 orange juice and 1 lemonade) off of the bill. The food was good (what you expect from Denny's),  but was not worth waiting 40 minutes for.
4 This is the nicest Denny's I have ever been to! It wasn't really busy so that was nice and the food came out fairly quickly. The waiter was very attentive and it was an overall good experience.
4 Bloody Mary with the 2 4 6 at Denny's, Oh yea. Now if they could that around here on the west side. Too bad you have to go all the way to Fremont st but this place was great. I will be returning the next time I am in town!!!!
4 This Denny's is not your mother's Denny's.   Great bar and a fun place to go downtown Las Vegas.   The beer was great and the specials were tasty.
4 Great Denny's location. They have a full bar AND a wedding chapel. Yeah you heard me right....a wedding chapel. I only know because the manager and I came up to our table and told us after our hangover breakfast that we could go get hitched in the back. Super clean with friendly staff. Hot food.
1 Wasn't good experience at all. Server seemed to not know what she was doing.  Had to ask for our toast twice. Water glasses were dirty with lipstick on the rim.
5 I usually don't review chains, because it defeats the purpose of the chain and also crowdsourced reviews.  A chain is a chain. But this Denny's is awesome.  The place was immaculate, the decor was hip and inviting, (I know what you're thinking... but this one is not your HoJo-style Dennys!) my server was super friendly (thanks Nidia!), and when I asked her after the meal where I could find a place on Fremont to sit down and churn out some work on my laptop for a few hours, she pointed over to the dining area.  Then she moved a table next to an outlet for me.  Customer service A++.  And the breakfast was good too.  Win.
4 Clean, they serve alcohol and the waiter was cool at 3 am. The food is what you come to love and hate about every other Denny's you've been to.  Saw some drama at the table next to us and it was pretty darn entertaining, an ex-husband was bugging his ex for whatever reason and she wasn't having it, let the sparks fly! Soooo the annoying girlfriend was getting involved and was sticking up for her gf, ex husband wasn't having it (we were right next to them, we had to listen) security got involved, high fives everywhere when he got kicked out. Then somehow after it all died down, he snuck back in, by then we were out of there.  The drinks are great, food you know and if you're there in the wee hours you might get a free show.
4 we usually come in late night after work and after the bars in Fremont East close.. or sometimes i'll even order food to go. the bar is always fun for groups. drink prices are great. good food for a 24 hour place. no smoking or gaming with full access to the bar :)) the kitchen has been inconsistent though and doesn't seem to know the menu or care.
1 We had horrible service!!
5 This is my all-time favorite Denny's. Not only do they have all the normal Denny's food, but they boast a full bar and an amazing Bloody Mary(it comes with a stick of bacon in it!)  The service is amazing. You can even sit outside and people watch on Fremont. What more could you need?
5 FIRST: they are open 24/7 SECOND: The have ALCOHOL THIRD: If you've had too much alcohol, they feed you some of their EXTENDED menu items, and are VERY-NEARLY-INSULTINGLY-NICE. I mean REALLY Nice. Even if I give them a hard time about not having soup after 11pm (which I think is just plain RUDE) they treat me right and give me my warm food and smile away.  ALSO: I took my friends out for their 21st birthday, and they were drunk after a hard night of drinking for them, and the wait staff comped their meal AND gave them desert with candles, without me asking them.   lovethemlovethemlovethem.
5 The greatest Denny's of all time. I mean, what is the point of writing a review of a Denny's?  I will tell you . . . because this one is friggin great. Normally, at a Denny's, you kind of know what you are going to get.  You will get a 3 star experience and that is entirely correct because of the product, the price and the ambiance.  Not here, Buddy! First off, the place is absolutely spotless, no mean feat in downtown LV!  Second, the service is really great.  We went here twice at different times of the day, in two very different frames of mind and were treated really well.  Antoinette is a sweetheart and couldn't do enough for us.  She even waved and said welcome back the next time!  Kaz is great and makes a great Cadillac Margarita .  . . . .  WHAT?  Booze?  In Denny's?  You bet!  What is more you can have it on a really great patio which is a great place to people watch.  The food was really good for the price.  I mean, you know what you are going to get, plus a little bit more.  It does have more options than a regular one. I slated a breakfast place in San Diego and quite rightly, I believe.  I got some clown email me to suggest I stick to Denny's.  Well, if they were all like this you can be sure that I would!  I even picked up a coozie!
4 This was the Tuesday my wife's cleaning lady comes.  Every two weeks, I come back from the gym, shower quickly, and then make a quick escape from the two so I don't have to hear their silly chatter.  More important, they want me the hell out of the way!  I needed to make a stop downtown anyway so I quickly decided to head for this Denny's.  I've driven by after a show several times and I wanted to try it. I parked in the city owned garage below Neonopolis and it's a short walk one flight up to get to the store areas and the Denny's.  The entrance is on the side.  I ordered a Start Up omelette which is a 3 egg omelette with a choice of cheese and comes with toast and hash browns or grits.  I got tomato slices instead of the toast and grits.  I had already been brought fresh coffee.  The omelette was a standard one with a fair amount of cheese inside.  The tomato slices were a nice change from the carbs of the breakfast sides.  The plate was one of the hottest plates I've touched in quite awhile and it kept the breakfast warm while I ate.  My server was a young woman who was very pleasant.  She brought me some Cholula as requested.  That's always a bonus.  One criticism--the small booths are really small!!  It would be hard to fit two standard sized adults in the space.  I pushed the table almost to the far side of the booth.  Sit at the counter or outside.  A couple of things.  They advertise that this is the only Denny's in the world with a wedding chapel.  Well, not really.  There's an area with some wedding photos on the wall and if you want to get married at Denny's in downtown Las Vegas, that's where it will be.  They move the tables aside and you exchange your vows there.  I am aware from the news that there has been a wedding here.  Well, the licenses are sold only a few blocks away.  Second thing, the parking in the garage below Neonopolis is so convenient.  Denny's does not validate for this city owned garage but I had no payment due when I left.  perhaps it was the time of day, the day of the week, or merely the fact that I was here for less than an hour.  I'll be back.  This is a really nice Denny's.
2 So this Denny's on Fremont is a mess late nights.   We were not greeted when we walked in, it took way too long to be seated.  It seems that most the servers had been partying, some seem wired etc.  Several times I had to ask for a side of the same sauce, twice she brought the wrong drink..  Then waitress openly tells us "oops, you can tell I drink" what the what?!?  Food was ok but rushed and looked messy.  I will only eat at this Denny's again if I'm more drunk then I was last time.  Great spot for cheap drinks (reason for 2nd star)
5 Came here after a 5k run downtown.  Me, my wife and 8 year old daughter were looking for some breakfast after an early morning.  This place looked good and we knew what to expect.    We were soaking wet after the run since it was the "Sprinkler Sprint" and they spray you with water cannons, super soakers, etc as a gimmick.  Not dripping, but enough for my daughter to be very cold when not in the sun.  We told the host that we were going to leave since she was so cold, but asked if they had any seats outside available.  He said that the patio seating was the part of the bar and my daughter couldn't sit there.  Then he told us to hold on a minute and went to ask his manager something. The host came back and told us that they had another patio area that wasn't open right now but they could get us a table, even better it was in the sun.  Not normally where's you'd want to sit during August in Las Vegas, but in our situation it was perfect.  They cleaned the table and set it especially for us.  The entire restaurant was spotless as well.    The rest of the meal was as you would expect from Dennys.  The waitress was pleasant and timely but nothing extraordinary.  The food came in a reasonable amount of time and was quite tasty.  The bill was reasonable.    I wouldn't normally think of Dennys when asked about great customer service, but this place does it right!  They went out of our way to help us when they could have just as easily told us they can't help.  I made sure to tell the manager, who was helping the cashier to ring up the long line of customers, what a great job the host did, as well as leaving an above average tip for above average service.
1 I love Denny's but after eating here I think I have to stay away from Denny's from a while. The service was terrible and there's no nice way to put it. We were given a bad attitude as soon as we walked in the door....way to set the mood!  I was mostly displeased with the female security guard for being so rude and off. I don't know maybe the terrible service is due to the fact that we visited this place late night...but  that is no excuse to treat customers so horribly.
1 Yiks this place needs a lot of work!! The food was so cold that the not so fresh fruit was warmer than it. The employees were so busy having fun with each other they forgot us and our food. The restaurant was so empty they should take a look at why. Staff should be thankful for the job.  If you are visiting the strip and think Dennys is a safe place to eat because its a big chain than think again. We were sick with stomach problems that could only be Dennys as the cause.  Go to a casino and take your chances there.
2 Well, it is Denny's. I mean ... it is fucking Denny's. (Say bye-bye to my goddamn security clearance; I am reviewing a Denny's; and, with my real name to boot!)  I saw a young lady crying at the table across from me the first time I dined here. I felt the urge to assure her that is was not that bad, but I had not received my order yet (after having placed it like twenty minutes prior), so I did not want to speak prematurely.   I was embarrassed that I could not manage to find somewhere better to eat after nearly everything else closed at 2 A.M. (including my beloved Pop-Up Pizza).   But at least I was not crying.  I mean, you have the choice of possibly shitty hot dogs on Fremont East surrounded by yuppies, or shitty previously frozen, nuked breakfasts at Neonpolis surrounded by drunken buffoons.   I went with the French Toast Slam® because I had not eaten at Denny's in many years. With the immense amount of calories I would ingesting in one sitting, I would not have to eat anywhere else for about twelve hours succeeding my visit.  And they have alcohol here. Might be one of only a few locations in the nation (are there that many Dennys outside of the U.S.?); but who cares -- there is alcohol all up and down fucking Fremont. Give me a break.   Get innovative: offer cannabis like in Amsterdam!  - E  Postscript. Their eggs are cage-free apparently. Have to give the evil corporation review-props for that.
4 Is this Denny's new? I don't remember it being here last year. It's very clean and seems that way. Our host, server and manager were extremely friendly.  This one is unique with its offerings of tvs and full bar; I'm wondering if the menu is the same nationwide.  I don't know how long it's been since I've dined at a Denny's in IL; I've never seen meatball lasagna on the menu. I've been on a meatball sandwich binge lately (no wonder I'm not losing weight); so naturally, I had to order the lasagna. It came with 2 slices of garlic bread.  It's filled with plentiful layers of meatballs, pasta, sauce and cheese. Heavy and filling, I finished 1/3 of my plate. No place for a microwave to heat it so I'm sad to admit the rest was wasted. My only hope now is to go to a neighborhood Denny's and find it on our menu.
3 It's Denny's...they're open 24/7 which is convenient when you're trying to sober up after a night out on Fremont St. But then again, it's Denny's, which means for the price you're paying you're going to get medicore food. Don't get me wrong, I love breakfast and diner food, but Denny's just isn't as good as other places. Kudos for decent service even at 3 am when they have limited staff on hand.
4 Denny's is Denny's no matter where you are.  They are all about the same.  This one is better than most because it's on Fremont Street!  Not only do you get to eat food you already know & love - you get to watch the crazies walk up & down Fremont.  This Denny's also has a cool photobooth that you can take crazy pictures in.    Being in such a touristy place, be prepared to wait a little longer.  It's pretty busy all the time.  The servers are always very nice.  Be nice to them & tip well - you wouldn't want to serve - so don't be an a-hole to your waiters or waitresses.
1 Took 15 min to take a to go order with only one person ahead of us. The gentleman was nice enough to allow my party to take our order and the cashier still didn't take our order. They had a complaint on waiting so long to pay there check and the cashier actually mentioned how he waited 45 min before,  when does an employee waiting become more important then a customer.  Ad we were waiting for our food two additional parties had complaints too!  Bad all the way around.
4 What can I say- its Denny's. Who doesn't love Denny's breakfast foods?! I can't get enough of their pancakes. I like the fact that there is a Denny's in the Fremont district. Im not sure how long this Denny's has been here, but its super clean and very modernized (not your typical looking Denny's)...I had no problem with service. Food came out at a reasonable time and my pancakes were yummy as always. Oh can't forget, it has a full bar.
4 Denny's has always been my drunken guilty pleasure. There's just something about the greasy diner food that hits the spot so a location on Fremont Street is perfect!  I stumbled upon Denny's while looking for a spot to grab a late night bite to eat and I was immediately sold. I asked for an order to-go and told the hostess that I had about 15 minutes before I needed to be back at the limo for my ride back to the Strip. She assured me that she would tell the kitchen to put a rush on the order and, sure enough, it was ready in plenty of time.   As I was looking at the menu, I noticed that the infamous seasoned fries were missing. Instead, there was a choice of regular fries or sweet potato fries. But I asked the hostess and she confirmed with the kitchen that they do still carry the seasoned fries. I'm not sure why they're not listed on the menu but I really hope that Denny's never gets rid of them. They are my favorite!   The seasoned fries paired perfectly with my bacon-less Super Bird and the hostess even threw in two containers of ranch (score!). The Super Bird tasted so incredible that I've been busy trying to recreate it at home for lunch all week. Definitely one of my favorite sandwiches!
3 Smart move to place a Denny's restaurant in Fremont District.  Hip, savy, and great decor.  The waiter was good with fast service and the food was good as well. I assume the place can be a mad house when real busy. It was raining during my stay so I'm pretty sure I didn't get to see the real action within establishment.  You can also get married at this location as well. Gotta love Vegas. I will eat here whenever im in town.
1 Plates were dirty and chipped. The staff was inattentive and the food was as good as all Denny's ,.
2 The food is standard Denny's food, you should know what to expect. This review is about their service, which was horrible. In fact I go there about once every three weeks and it is always HORRIBLE. Had to wait 10 mins to get seated when it was empty. Another 15 for my order to be taken. Then when the food is dropped off the waiter leaves the bill. He is missing the entire dining experience, not once did he stop by to see how things were. I had to ask three other servers to get my waiter to request a ranch, and that took him ten minutes.   Now I understand that restaurants sometimes get busy, but it was dead. The server was so rude and miserable. And Its not the first time he has waited on me, it's the third time. And every single time he looks miserable and is rude. Get some waitstaff that wants to actually work Denny's!
3 It was slow to get seated, but they have alcohol and the service was good one we were at a table. And the food was good ole standard dennys. The place was clean and comfortable.
1 My friends and I went there after everything was closing in Downtown. Though the service was okay, the food came out horrible. Worst of all, I ordered an Irish Coffee. They charged me $4.50 for the Irish Coffee and then $5.00 for Baileys.  A $9.00 Irish Coffee. When I complained , the manager said I had to call the General Manager and the District Manager to get any recourse. Never going there again. I absolutely do NOT recommend it.
1 They don't have the standard value menu which is dumb, and they didn't give us silverware until after the food was here... On top of that, not mentioning that a substitution is going to cost an extra $1.30 for a chicken sausage and then saying that I should know it costs extra...whack.  Definitely not a Grand Slam, more like a strike out.
4 This Dennys is super convenient and is the best drunk food ever we were on Fremont all night partying very hard and this dennys came to our rescue as we all went inside and order a different things from breakfast to dinner after a salad they accommodated all of our needs and took great pride in giving us the best service on Fremont for a restaurant
4 This Denny's is located downtown, has a bar, and it is beautiful!  It's modern with a hint of whimsy.Though the food is what you'd expect from any other Denny's, the atmosphere is not! Check it out!
2 Worst Dennys in the southwest! The food was smothered in grease and the pancakes had left over char from past cooked food! Oh and I didn't get silverware until I was seated.
1 What the hell happened?  Went here again, exact same time of year, one of the same servers.... the place was dead and I see why!  The bar didn't have a bartender in the middle of the day, the service was horrible, the food was crap, even the girl at the cash register was rude.  Wow, what a decline.  Last year was so great, the place was rammed and times were good.  The worst turnaround I have ever seen.  How do you mess up a Denny's?  Wow.
4 We thought it was going to be super packed but it wasn't in and out of there in an hour and a half
