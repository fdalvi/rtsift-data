3 The aisles are kind of cramped, and it looks a bit run down. It's not as big and open as that other big pet supply store. But the one thing that makes a difference to me, in their favor, is the variety of pet food brands they carry.   I have to feed one of my cats grain-free food, and at PetCo, I have the choice of 3 or 4 brands that offer grain-free varieties. At PetSmart, I think I found one. Everything else was Friskies or some such that I could find at the grocery store. The prices for these foods are pretty reasonable as well, especially if you shop the Petco P.A.L.S. deals.  Their prices for litter are good too. They even sell bulk litter, where you buy the first bucket, and then pay for refills. It works out to about $11 for a 28lb pail. Plus you don't buy all that packaging over and over.
2 HIGH PRICES and lack luster customer service from staff. PetSmart is much better in my opinion.
1 Very disappointed with this particular location.  Employees outside the main entrance to the store smoking, no acknowledgment from the staff that was inside the store, poor selection, high prices, staff member at main register talking on her cellphone, dead fish in the aquariums.  Just a very dismal atmosphere and a severe lack of customer service.  I get a vibe from this location that maybe its on its way out? Maybe the lease is going to expire? Maybe that is why the employees act the way they do? Who knows?
