5 My family has been going to this US Cellular for years. They have always accommodated us in the most welcoming, professional, and hospitable way possible. They are always amazing with setting my family up with new phones, and finding ways to lower our monthly bill! The staff is AMAZING in every way and should be commended for their work.
1 Entered the store with a 6 mo old HTC Desire that just stopped working. Service guy checks it over very thoroughly and says - it's broke.  What are my options? See if you can get an upgrade. Sales guy - You are not due for an upgrade until next June.  What are my options? You could buy used or new.  Left the store and called US Cellular customer service on wifes phone. I am standing outside your store with a broken phone. What are my options? You are not due for an upgrade until next June - I KNOW that, is there anything else that can be done ? A new phone is $500. I go home and check my warranty - The phone has a 12 month warranty, but did any of the 3 service/sales people that I talked to ever tell me that my phone was eligible for warranty service??? No because they don't care about anything but selling you a phone. Let's continue this review at the east side US Cellular. Follow me
1 My family were loyal US Cellular customers for 12 years. They were once the best. Now their customer service is the worst. They've penalized their customers for the bad billing implementation. Try to talk to managers in customer service, and you'll hear the rudest, most uncaring attitude. Goodbye forever US Cellular!
