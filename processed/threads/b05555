2 This place was old - old - old. The lady at the front desk barely lifted her eyes enough to tell me there were "newer" novels in a small shelf in the front. I like to find old treasures at places like this but it didn't seem to have anything too exciting. The newer novels weren't bad but there was only a very small section in which I only found one novel that caught my attention. Wouldn't go back...
1 Soooooooooo DISAPPOINTED!  I LOVE BOOKS!  I love the smell of the paper, I love to touch the pages as I read (you'll NEVER catch me with an E-Reader/Kindle etc. NEVER!!!).  I especially LOVE used book stores.  I love the fact that there are others out there who have the same love and appreciation for reading as I do!  Reading is like a lost art in my opinion!  This place DIDN'T DO IT FOR ME.....I'm so disappointed!  There's no organization to the books and they are lacking terribly in stock.  I prefer books about the military, war, history, bios and auto bios........this place was littered with ROMANCE novels.  BLAAAAAAHHHHHHH!   :( I was however, able to find three of four books that I wanted to purchase admidst the chaos, and when I removed my bank card from my wallet, I was subjected to my least favorite phrase, "We don't accept credit cards, only cash!"  What?  What in the hell?  Who doesn't "accept" bank cards for crying out loud?  I'm not a cash carrying person, I'm just not and probably never will be. So, this story concludes with:  I most likely will never rerturn to this bookstore, and I am still in search of another.  *If you know of any great used book stores in town, please message me because I'd love to check them out! :)
5 I am visiting Las Vegas for just a day in the middle of a long road trip and was desperate to replenish my book supply.  Westgate Books did the trick and I had a WONDERFUL and lengthy book-centered conversation with the owner/manager.  I found her extremely kind, helpful and VERY knowledgeable.  THANK YOU!!!
