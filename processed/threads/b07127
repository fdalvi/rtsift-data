4 Okay...so I'm liking the Boston Store. I've NEVER really taken the time to shop here, mostly because 75% of the items here are overpriced. However, I've gotten good at shopping the clearance racks. You can find some great deals if you're willing to take the time to browse. Also, I broke down and got the card, so I get coupons ALL the time. All. The. Time. Like, once a day...maybe it's a bit stalkerish. BUT, the $50 off $100 coupon I got the other day makes the flooded inbox worth it.   Bottom line: If you're willing to dig through the racks, and come in with a coupon, you can get great merch for decent prices!
4 While I prefer the layout of the Eastside Boston Store, this location has a good spot mid-mall and has certain things not found elsewhere: a Bobbi Brown counter and a really big handbag selection. Always good service here and competitive pricing.
1 No one to help at all. Best part was the fitting rooms. Not a single one was clean anywhere in the men's department. Seriously look at the picture.
