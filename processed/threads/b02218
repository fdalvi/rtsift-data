3 This place is a neighborhood pub and is very "hit or miss". One thing I learned yesterday, if Amanda's pouring drinks, order beer. I ordered a vodka and soda. It was a very light pour. So I ordered an extra shot...which came out about 1/2" of vodka in a shot glass. So, the next drink, I went ahead and ordered a double. It tasted just like the first drink did BEFORE I poured the extra shot in it. And I paid $8.00 a piece for these two drinks! Last week, we met some friends there and the drinks were poured perfectly. I would have been hard pressed to even drink a double. The first time I ate there (after the new menu), I ordered a veggie burger. It was microwaved so much it was like shoe leather. The next time I went in, I avoided the veggie burger and ordered a french dip with a side salad. It was a great sandwich and the salad was fresh and crisp!! Yesterday, I went in and ordered the french dip again. "Meh" is all I can say about it. And the salad had obviously been made much earlier and covered with plastic wrap because it was all squished down in the bowl in that shape. I'm sure for the local neighborhood patrons, this is all just fine because they go there to see all of the other neighborhood patrons. So, take your chances!
