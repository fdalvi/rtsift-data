3 Good work, Jay-Z!  I really hate most clubs in Las Vegas.  There's often way too many people, making it incredibly hot, impossible to move around, and generally a bad time.  This is an exception.  I went this past Friday night during a special grand opening party and was pleasantly surprised.  There are two levels.  The top level has all the VIP rooms.  There's also VIP seating on the edges.  The Jay-Z lounge is awesome.  You can play some pool but best of all there's a huge patio area that takes you right onto the strip.  It's an amazing location.  The centerpiece of the 40/40 club is mulit-level couch seating (very comfortable) that faces perhaps the largest HD projection screen I've ever seen.  The 40/40 doubles as a sports bar/restaurant during the day with no cover charge.  I definitely plan to take in a game here sometime soon.  The lower level includes a good size dance area and more places to grab a drink.  The only drink I bought was a Bud Light for a surprisingly reasonable $5.  (this is the strip)  The 40/40 is inside the Palazzo which hasn't even had it's official grand opening yet.  Go and enjoy yourself.  UPDATE: After going to 40/40 on a night where the drinks were not free, and they let just anyone in, I was sadly disappointed.  15 bucks for a long island?  You've gotta be high.  Oh, and I can't pay with my card unless I rack up 30 bucks or more?  I'm outta here.  Three stars for you.  And that's for the location only.
3 40/40 has potential.  Maybe it was just the night that we were there, but my friends and I didn't really enjoy it.  We got in quickly, but then only stayed for a little bit because of the music...it was SO LOUD.  I don't mind it when the music is cranked up, but this was uncomfortably loud.  Like, feel- the-tip-of-your-nose-vibrate loud (no, I'm not making that up).  Make-you-nauseated loud.  "I want to leave NOW" loud.  So yeah, we left.    I think it would be an awesome place to watch a big game, though.  They have huge screens everywhere, and a big VIP area with stadium seating (at least, I think that was VIP).  I imagine it would be a lot of fun for the Super Bowl.
2 I agree with another reviewer that this place would be great as a sportsbar, but horrible as a nightclub.  They have a huge flat screen tv and plenty of comfy couches to sit and watch sports games.    They have several bars... one near those couches, one upstairs, one downstairs, and one near some VIP booths.    The dancefloor is downstairs and it's pretty small.  The bouncers are very anal about anyone leaning on the empty VIP couches downstairs  (sheesh!  can't a girl rest her feet??).    The music was horrible.  I totally wasn't feeling the constant rap music.  You just can't dance to it.    And the crowd was a lot older... I would say 30s to 40s.  I would definitely pass on this club next time.  The interior did not wow me at all.
3 Uber sports bar for the menzezes who need their white leather and 40 by 40 foot big screen with sliders and their gin and juice.  This place is going to be off the heezee for March Madness........I'm soooooooo hooood!  Happy Birthday Davy!  The Big 40, but you don't look a day over 24 big brother!
1 We went to this place twice in two days and my experience there is what made me give it this rating:  POSITIVE When I stepped into this place I was really amazed with the setup and layout of it. All over the place are plush areas to sit down with a ton of TVs to watch everything all over the place. In the main area there is a huge screen (like someone mentioned 40' x 20' screen) with stadium seating. All around the back there other nicely furnished rooms with more big screen TVs and the like.  The other good thing about this place was our service. On both occasions our servers were very attentive and always checked on us and asked if we needed anything. Even the backup servers helped us out whenever we needed anything as well.  NEGATIVE On our first occasion here we were led on a little tour and then seated in the "Sapphire Room" towards the back of the place. Like I said earlier it was nicely furnished and there was a pool table in there. We were sitting in there having a good time for about twenty minutes and had gotten our first round of drinks when our waitress asked us if we knew that it was a $40 spending minimum PER PERSON for us to sit in that particular room! No one had mentioned this when we were first seated so we were pretty taken aback when we heard this. As we only wanted to have a few drinks and watch basketball we decided to take ourselves out of this section to an area where there was no preset spending limit. Granted I know you need to spend some kind of money when you're watching sports in bars, but this was absurdly high.  The food we had here, while it wasn't bad, it was pretty mediocre. -On our first trip here we had the cheese fries. The fries were only OK, but what really set this appetizer back was the fact that they dumped like cheese whiz cheese on it or that rubbery cheese you get with your nachos from 7-11. How hard is it to get shredded cheddar and micro or heat it so that it melts on the fries? -The second meal I had at this place were their "40/40 burgers" which essentially is their version of sliders. Nothing to write home about either. I asked for them to be done medium and they were pretty charred when I got them. Twelve dollars for three little burgers that were overcooked? Once again, just OK. -Some of the other meals that I saw but didn't try were their pizzas. It looked like something that came from the freezer section at the supermarket, like Aunty Celeste's pizzas or something. They didn't look that appetizing and no one really said much about them so I assume they weren't that great either. -Drinks were kinda pricey too.  Now for the really bad part of our whole experience. We had a group of eight of us when we came and one of our buddies who set the thing up had called in to make reservations for us to having prime seating in this place. When we get their this big bouncer tells us that making reservations "doesn't really mean anything." That's all well and good I guess, now if they only took all that stuff about making reservations off their website then.  So the next thing he tells us is that "if you take care of me, I'll take care of you."  And so my friend who set up the whole thing was like OK, fine, so he shelled out $60 for us to get prime seating. What does our bouncer guy do, he goes into the prime seating area and kicks out a few guys that are sitting in there  so that we can sit down. After we get in there we find out that there's not enough space for our group to sit down, so we have to talk to our "friend" one more time to find us a space that we all can fit in. Luckily he found us an open corner where we could all sit, but unfortunately two of us didn't have ANY view of a television set whatsoever.  After this whole seating thing, we were kinda rubbed the wrong way. At the end of the night we wanted to talk to the manager about what had happened and finally after about twenty minutes of talking to people we finally got the attention of the manager (who really didn't look or feel like a manager from the way she was dressed). Essentially she told us to come back tomorrow as they have to review tapes and talk to people to find out exactly what happened. Seeing as how we were headed somewhere else already we said we would come back the next day to hopefully resolve everything.  I was less than confident that things would be resolved the next day, but when we went back to 40/40 the next day we went in and the bouncer guy that took our money came up to us, said the manager wanted him to talk to us and apologize for what happened last night and he even gave us our money back. While it was great that he did this it didn't seem too sincere and I was actually surprised that the manager didn't come out to talk to us to make sure this whole thing was resolved.  In the end we'll probably not go to this place again. Like other Yelpers have said this place doesn't know what it wants to be. Sorry Jay-Z, cool place, but not a cool experience.
2 Went here to watch a few Elite 8 games over the weekend.  It was quite crowded on Sat., but on Sun. it was more or less empty.  I made a few bets in front of the club, and wanted to watch the games.  The main seating area has a minimum of 1 bucket of beer ($80-$90 I was told), but there are seats in the back that have no minimum purchase requirements.    The server that came by was pretty pushy and aggressive since the place was pretty empty.  She kept pushing for drink/food orders and even grabbed my water bottle I brought in from the casino area (never even had the chance to finish it).  I was pretty pissed about this since I saw others with water bottles without any problems.    Food is pretty expensive and mediocre.  I got the catfish and fries as a snack since I had breakfast earlier.  Since the server would not provide any tap water, I ended up getting a coke for $3.50.  The coke was pretty flat and came out in 12 or 14oz cup that was full of ice.  After about 3 or 4 sips, but coke was gone.  I asked for a refill and after she brought out another one (same small cup full of ice and a little bit of coke).  Anyways, when I got my bill, I realized that there were no free refills!  She could have at least warned me about this when I asked her for a refill.  So 7 bucks and I probably only had 10oz of a flat coke.  Couple other negatives.. AMEX is not accepted and servers are a bit "heavy" and not very attractive.  I would expect a club like this to at least have some standards when hiring their staff (maybe morning/noon staff isn't the best).  If I'm going to pay these type of prices for food and drinks, I expect semi-attractive servers.  Same analogy as when I gamble in Venetian vs. a Downtown casino (I have never been disappointed in the cocktail waitresses in Venetian).  Also a mandatory 20% tip was automatically added to my bill (it was just me and a friend).  The service was pretty bad, but I guess the servers don't care since they get an automatic 20%.    There are plenty of places to watch sporting games so I definitely won't be coming to this "wannabe" high end establishment.
4 Chilled here during the middle of the day to watch a basketball game.  Didn't order anything, but looked at their menu and that shit looked Vegas expensive.  I give this place 4 stars for the great bar/lounge ambiance, the nice comfortable couches, the big ass flat screen TVs everywhere, the free Pac Man video games and Pool table, and the nice sound system when music's getting played.  I have to take off 1 star cause of the prices on their menu and because I'd expect a Jay-Z owned place to have way hotter girls working, but hey I went in the middle of the day when they're not even charging cover or checking IDs at the door, so maybe the night time atmosphere is a totally different vibe.  But if you're looking for a sports bar to just watch a game at and not drink or buy a damn thing, this is the spot to just lounge at with the homies for a couple hours.  But if you're ballin as fuck and trying to find a spot to get the Cristal bottles poppin, then this might be a good spot to do so.  Not sure how the dancing and lounging environment is like at night though.
3 I went on a Sunday night, no big games on... there was plenty of staff and lots of comfy places to sit... Food was a spiced-up version of bar food, but I liked it. (who can say no to fried twinkies or snickers?!)  Although, I have to say while the drink menu was extensive; the quality was mediocre at best, you're better off getting shots or beers. (hmmm...mandatory gratuity for 2 people?!? I dunno Hova, you may want to rethink that)   Great as a sports bar...can't comment on club nights-but I heard it gets crackin. Cheers!
3 40/40 club is more of a huge ultra lounge than a Vegas nightclub.  First time we came here (Feb 08') there was no cover, the downstairs area was open for the dance floor, nice outdoor area with lots of seating, very nice place for a bunch of friends to just get together for a few drinks, watch some games on the flat screens and talk about our high school days, (lots of fun), came back this past weekend April 08' still no cover (for ladies) which was not not a problem since our group was only ladies, but $30 drink minimum plus automatic 20% gratuity! yikes!**fun for mixed groups guys/girls since there's flat screens showing various sporting events in every room, and great for groups who aren't looking for the club scene, but a place where you could actually sit down, dress code isn't such an issue and somewhere you can actually carry a conversation....but only if you have the ca$h flow like "Jayonce" 2 stars for providing plenty of open space with LOTS of seating/ decor 1 star for the staff, bartenders were very quick, and busser who quickly cleared glasses, even got matches for my girlfriend -2 stars for drink prices and gratutiy  p.s the 2nd night I came here, the dance floor was NOT crackin'...not sure if it was because it was the night of the Kanye concert but Tao at the Venetian had a line that looked like Splash mountain @ Disneyland!
3 I don't get this place at all, it was Thursday night 9pm and almost completely dead inside except for our team party to celebrate the end of our conference.  The place is really nice, it's definitely more of a sports bar or a private party lounge for the boys.  We had the Jay Z suite, which opened out into a patio right on the strip.  Ridiculously nice location and amenities, but seriously where was everyone.   I couldn't help noticing that all the waitresses were small Asian girls.  What's up with that, what are you trying to tell us Jay Z?
1 Wow..This club is S-U-C-K Hahaha sorry for Libby. The problem with this place....it isn't the decor. It's not the location. It's kinda a cheesey pimp my ride place. Its hard for me to support this place because the bartenders were kinda douches to me. AND I KNOW PEOPLE WHO WORK HERE! Also they wanna run this place like they run it in NY. Problem is it's different here. I even interviewed for this place and I didn't like the vibe the people gave out. So this place also owes a lot of money. Not the best place to work from what I understand. I even waited to get in....wow. Drinks are expensive. But someone has to pay for the freaking gold and platinum floors. I figure the next time I come I'm gonna bring a pick axe and mine me some precious metals. Hey Times are Tough... Ya this isn't a club. It's a high end sports bar. But it can be a little ghetto fabulous. I mean I'm not one to rip on Jay Z but ahem...this is my hood. Why didn't you ask me how to run this place? Dont forget the people who make Vegas go - it's not all tourist it's the locals too!
3 EDIT: wow ROTD? Cool. Don't know how it happened but I'll take the fame and glory! thx  I kind of have mixed feelings about this place. I just went this past Saturday and I will say that I had more fun here than I had at Poetry on Friday. I've been hearing nothing but bad things about this place but I had to check it out because it's Jay's spot and I've never been to the one in NY. Now the place is HUGE but maybe because I didn't go in until 2AM (no line) there just wasn't that many people inside. What I can say though is, it's wayyyyy too overpriced for what you get. Yeah the music was great, the decor is off the chain, but I paid 30 to get in. Then paid another 30 for 2 f*ckin drinks!!!! I'm sorry even for vegas that's doing too much. No wonder chicks were houndin me for drinks all night (broke a$$es). Anyway, other than that everyone there was real cool, security is cool and friendly, the chicks weren't all completely stuckup compared to the hoodrats at Poetry. My drunk ass just had fun and I had a great time. Now would I go back? Ummm maybe if I got in for free or maybe if there was a special event, but honestly it's just a sports lounge that doesn't offer anything special besides having the bragging rights of saying you went to 40/40.   So here's some inside info that I got from security, so if you plan on dressing or looking hood, you can't say you were not warned. Security is so strict (Palazzo ain't playin') that they filter out who they don't want in the club from the ENTRANCE OF THE CASINO! So let's say you pull in you ride smellin like weed bumpin some Wayne lookin like a bloods and crips reunion album cover, the security from the entrance radios the valet parking, when you pull up to valet parking, they will tell you it's full, so they hope that instead of trying to find self parking and walking to the club you'll just end up going somewhere else. Now let's say that you do self park and walk all the way over to the club, well the security in the casino already knows who to look for they radio the club door and they will tell you they aren't letting people in, it's packed etc. So my suggestion is dress to impress or you're gonna get th run around, it's VEGAS dammit! If you wanna keep it hood stay on the north side or kick it on the strip in front of PH with all the rest of the hood.
1 Where's the 1/4th of a star option?!  'TERRIBLE at best' is how I rate my experience at 40/40.  The only reason that I was hyped to go was because of Jay-Z's star power and to support a black businessman.   **coughMISTAKEcough**  The ONLY saving grace for this place was the atmosphere and decor:   Plush seating areas with plenty of flat screens for our group who was there to catch the Spurs/Lakers game on a Sunday during the Memorial Day weekend.   Bathrooms LOOKED nice.  But skip them if you're accustomed to such trivial things as toilet seat covers OR toilet paper!   So...I called ahead of time to see what the place was all about since the website was obviously designed by a blind, deaf mute.  I was told that reservations were necessary so I made one for 5.  We arrived and the place was pretty close to EMPTY for playoffs.  There was no clear host station so we just walked around until we saw people in 40/40 shirts. We asked where do we check in. We were directed to a woman who was just standing around, dressed as we were; no name tag or 40/40 insignia.  I told her we had reservations. She DID NOT ask our name; just how many were in our party. We were then walked in a FULL circle around the place to find somewhere to sit.  We stopped at NUMEROUS areas before finally being seated in a very nice area with sueded (or microfiber) walls, pillows and bench, 3 white leather chairs, two ottomans and a coffee table. The decor was very impressive, however, THIS is where the fun ended.    The menu was encyclopedia-heavy, with 2-3 pages for food and 7,639 CHAPTERS (it seemed) of PRICEY drinks with trying-WAAAYYY-too-hard names. DON'T come hungry, poor OR expecting greatness. You'll get a half-assed attempt at UNSEASONED, hardly microwaved frozen food and a sorry pile of bullshit disguised as salad or a garnish on your plate.  We started off trying out several appetizers. (Crab Cakes, Breaded Catfish Sticks, Buffalo Wings, The Picnic {should have been named the YUCKFUCK!}, and Cheese Bread.)  EVERYTHING arrived LUKE-FRIGID except for the dry hot wings which were a work-with-able temperature.  The "cheese bread" was nothing more than Grocery Outlet-quality  frozen deep dish pizza cut into 4 uneven sticks. It arrived to us looking like it had seen a ghost; PETRIFIED. It was cold, hard, and dry...and $8!! **tears**  As a fat girl, I'll try anything ONCE, but just the sight of those 4 dead bodies saved me from a few unnecessary calories.   I cut the roof of my mouth on the hard chicken "shits" that were part of The Picnic. The breading was so hard that it couldn't be bitten into. I had to tear them apart with my hands and melt them in Ranch for a good minute or 5 JUST to be able to TASTE them. And I was more than disappointed once I started chewing. The Picnic consisted of 2 fried deviled eggs (BLECH!) and too many hard, dry chicken shits all for $12.  I wish I would have asked for my $11.99 in change.  Our waitress was very unknowledgeable about the menu. She seemed young and unprepared for the job.  When asking about certain dishes she'd only  "heard" everything was good but didn't KNOW ANYthing. Food was brought out WITHOUT the promised dipping sauces and when requested, the waitress acted as if she'd NEVER heard of them, even though we pointed them out on the menu! She said, "Well this is how they always come out."  We were offered Ranch and a buffalo dipping sauce and that's IT. Great! [/sarcasm]  When requesting water, we were brought a carafe of water with lemon. I asked if we could have one without lemon and was told that it would take about 20 minutes.  Water with lemon...INSTANTLY!! Water WITHOUT lemon...20 minutes. Ok...that makes sense. [/sarcasm]  So Annoyed, I just cancelled the water and decided to live with the metallic taste of blood from the skin on the roof of my mouth hanging to my tongue after attempting to eat the dry chicken shits.    Besides the food and service, what annoyed us most was the plastic shopping bag of 40/40 paraphernalia the waitress carried. I thought she had just walked into work and didn't have time to drop her things off before manning her stations. I asked what was she carrying and was told that they're MADE to carry souvenirs just in case patrons want to purchase them. My thoughts: "Ummm...whatever happened to a STORE?!" I felt sorry for the girl as she juggled menus, plates, glasses, and tabs while trying to keep the crumpled bag on her shoulder.  Overall, I just PRAY this is JUST a franchise and Jigga-Man is NOT directly in charge of this fuckery. But if he IS, PLEASE BELIEVE I'm gonna Limewire-download and bootleg-sell EVERY SINGLE Def Jam,  Roc-A-Wear and all associated items I can to get my $$$ back!!!!
4 I went here during the middle of the day this past weekend, NOT at night, so I can't comment on how it is as a club.  Upon entering we were given a tour of the place, which I recommend to anyone stopping by.  After being awed, we chilled at the outdoor area.  It was a great place to kick back and chill, and it had a nice view of the strip.  The drink menu was over the top, and one of my friends got really buzzed thanks to the bartender messing up the drink order and making an extra martini (I was surprised that they actually gave the extra drink to us).  However, be sure to watch your tab; they automatically tagged on a 20% tip to my friend's bill without him noticing.  We weren't here late at night or during any huge games, but I highly recommend it as a stop to kick back and enjoy a few drinks away from the smoke and flashing lights of Vegas.  For a few moments, at least.
1 Wow. This place sucks big Time. Somone commented earlier that they are running this place like it's in NYC and they don't get it that this is Vegas where there are much more "high quality" entertainment options. The decor is off the chain but when I went on a Friday evening around 9:00 PM the place was empty. There were probably 6 other people there. Then I came back around 11:00 PM on Saturday and could not get in because I had on a pair of Lugz shoes and the obviously undereducated bouncer said "dem is boots" and would not let me in because they do not allow people to wear boots in the club. So I took my money and time and spent it somewhere else. If they lose the elitist attitude they would do much better. A sports bar that plays hip-hop music should feel like one. Oh, by the way, I went to the 4040 club in NYC for New Years last year and it was so over crowded that you could not even move around in the place. It was horrible too.
1 I went here to watch the Lakers/Celtics game on Tuesday 6/17.  The place is nice (has a lot of plasmas and nice couches) and a good atmosphere to watch the game.  However, the way they run things absolutely turned me off and I will never go back there again.  First they tell us that there is $50 minimum spend area and a $100 minimum spend area.  We opted to go with the $100 area.  Then they tell us that it won't be a $100 minimum but we have to buy this $90 appetizer plate instead which comes with 3 appetizers.  The appetizer plate was not that big, probably worth about $35-$40.  I understand that if you expect to stay there the whole game then you should spend more money and I was happy to spend a minimum of $100 but to be forced to spend $90 on an overpriced appetizer plate left a bad taste in my mouth.  They don't take AMEX so I had to use my debit card.  They charged my card 3 times and an extra $350.  In addition, our server was pushy.  There are a ton of places to watch sports in Vegas, you don't need to go to this one.
2 Jay-Z and Damon Dash I must say I expected more out you both. I have been of fan since I can remember but 40/40 makes me realize that there can be hiccups in successful careers. I love sports bars like no other but this one came up short. On my first trip to the 40/40 and what may be my last, I was reminded of several Jay-Z classics...  First, "99 Problems"...and yes...your bitch is one of them! Can we say the women here are rude as hell and I am talking about the bar-wenches. When I am trying get my drink on, I don't need my bartender to take forever to take my order, be rude and on top of that poor a sorry ass drink.     "Can I Get A" What? What?....A drink dammit! After the disappointment of the first, I needed another quickly. I swear my group and I made up about 50 percent of the patrons that evening and you would think service would be prompt but it wasn't. Arghh!! So since the NBA finals were on, my group and I decided to get some bottle service and a private room. "Show Me What You Got" to the host I said and we were directed to the Alex Rodriguez private room. I must digress that I am one of those Yankee haters and think everything the team does is foul but 40/40 with A-Rod's help hit a home run with this one...."BIG PIMPIN". Decor was beautiful with couches, flat-screen and a pool table. We ordered food which was something to be desired but the awesome space made up for it.  By the way, food came out incorrectly 2 times.  Speaking of "Big Pimpin", 40/40 did indeed "Change the Game" when it comes to taking advantage of the avid sports fan. I was impressed with the vast numbers of TVs and the huge theater size screen in the middle of the club that plays ESPN constantly. The stadium seating of couches was very impressive as well.    Overall my experience here left a bad taste in my mouth. Do I want an "Encore"? Well, there is nothing but "Girls, Girls, Girls" looking like they just came out of a video and need to "Change Clothes" and the "Roc Boys" who aren't "winners" try way to hard to floss their fake chains. If you are looking for that kind of environment,  then this is the place for you. Because I am a sports fanatic I will give it another go for another major sporting event but until then 40/40 has definitely "Lost One".
2 For a place called Jay Z's 40/40 club, why did they not play a single Jay Z track?!? Explain that to me! This place is cool for lounging and watching a game, but otherwise just as a restaurant this establishment is horrible. The service was particularly atrocious as our waitress could not hear a damn word we uttered, didn't know what a Guinness was, didn't even give us utensil sets, and took forever to get us what we ordered. And when she required a credit card AND photo ID without fully explaining their policy and rationale for this process, I thought I was a prime candidate for identity theft. So with the required 20% gratuity, which was grossly undeserved, we felt this place was highly overrated.   The food itself was just ok. We ordered a sampler plate for an appetizer and the chef forgot to give us the buffalo wings. The mini burgers were charcrisped and well done. We tried the supreme (chicken + steak + chili) tri colored nachos and they were decent. Best items were the desserts: fried twinkies and fried snickers. Pretty awesomely artery clogging. I'll need some more fried twinkies in my life.   One more gripe that my friends would have would be paying $3 for watered down soda in a glass filled with ice. Two sips and the liquid was gone. GRIPE!   Very disappointed with this place. Love the couches and the lounging, dislike the food and service. If you can live without the latter, by all means go here. Otherwise, save your money and go somewhere else to watch a game (aka the sportsbook).
2 The music was alright. The dance floor was very small. To be honest this club has a lot to be desired. I was very disapointed. I like Jay-Z but the club was not a good look at all. It was like night club meets a seedy sports bar! Very disturbing. I was in VIP and the everything is so small and pack together I had to keep moving out of my seat everytime the waitress needed to get by to serve drinks because the walk way was so narrow. Also I was turned off at the fact this was supposed to be an upscale club and the first thing the waitress asked me was " do you guys want some hot wings" WTF!! The whole place smelled like chicken and beer all night long. The only highlight of the even was meeting Matt G. from The New England Patriots! He's pretty cool.
2 This place is like a bimbo with huge fake tits.  All looks, no substance.   Positives: Space, look, style  Negatives: Everything else... bad/slow service, horrific food (nachos had a bootleg version of cheez whiz), uneducated staff, no dance floor, and bad music (the irony)  We wanted to watch the UFC here and it was pretty much our only choice. I'd definitely not waste your time and money.
1 If you are thinking of visiting this establishment in Las Vegas I have some advise for you.  STOP! DON'T DO IT! WASTE OF MONEY!  The drinks are overpriced and not good.  My dessert was bad. (You can't serve fried Twinkies and snickers cold)   Music okay. I know it's Jay-Z club but I don't need to hear him every other song.  My hostess wasn't informed about the club practices and swiped my card too many times. I ended up with a $400 hold on my account which didn't drop until 3 days after I got back home.  Needless to say, I won't be back and you should save yourself a trip too.
1 We go to 40/40 every time we visit Vegas.  We usually have a pretty good time.  Friday nights are cool if you want a nice atmosphere with it being sort of empty.  You can chill with friends and sit anywhere you want.  So, when we went this past Saturday, we decided to take it up a notch and get bottle service.  Bad mistake.  Don't do it.  It's a scam.  Here are the details:  When I made the deal for the table, I was told that I would receive two bottles of champagne, strawberries, and a table large enough to fit the six people in my party for $400.  I received two bottles, but the strawberries were two that were cut into a lot of pieces.  The table didn't fit my party.  We were made to squeeze on a sectional designed to fit two people.  So we had to squeeze 3 people on the couch and the other three had to sit on foot stools.  They then presented a $533 bill.  I refused to sign the credit card statement because I was overcharged.  They threatened to call police if I didn't sign.  Someone was assigned to "watch me" for almost 2 hours before the manager took the time to talk to me.  He told me that the best he could do was charge me $450.  Since there six people in my party, I decided to sign so we could leave.  It was almost 5 am at that point.  I very calmly attempted to inform them that we were not satisfied with our accommodations and that we were being over charged.  Since it was in a club, I had a hard time hearing them.  I asked if I could talk to him outside and he refused to talk to me outside of the club.  Their initial response was to threaten to call police on me and that I would have to wait 3 hours to wait for them to get there.    From what I learned from talking to three different club security employees that the 40 40 club scams people to get them into the club and getting their credit cards, then overcharges them at the end of the night because they think people will be too drunk to notice.  They were very rude and weren't willing to acknowledge or resolve the dispute.
5 DON'T GIVE YOUR BUSINESS TO THIS CLUB!!!!!  SHADY....SHADY....SHADY!!!  We were totally scammed---Promoter offered a $400 bottle service deal incl. 2-bottles of Moet to get into the club, and by the end of the night charged the credit card $600 for this "deal"  The general manager was extremely rude and threatened to call the police because we didn't want to authorize the "new" amount.   If you check the BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU you'll see that there have been several complaints regarding the dispute of credit card charges.
2 I went to 40/40 Las Vegas this past weekend.  I made reservations for party of 13 and we were seated right away in a very nice area when we arrived.  Later on one of the waitresses took a portion of our area and seated someone else there.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars was because it is a beautiful club.  The decor is really very nice, but everything else about the club was very disappointing.  Food and drinks seriously overpriced and were not all that.  The bartenders were automatically adding their own $2.00 tip to your drink tabs and some of the staff were very snotty.  We had to call the manager over to our table to dispute the bill as did the table next to us ($80 for chicken strips, umm I think not!).  They had security staff standing around telling you where you could and could not walk in the club like the president was there.  The club was not even packed, there were no VIP's  in the house (they were all over at Trsyt & Blush).  No one was dancing on the tiny dance floor.  And they played Beyonce and Jay-Z's songs every 5 minutes (no offense B and Jigga).
3 After checking out a handful of reviews I felt my hand inch the mouse towards validation of the two-star ratings. Somehow note waiting in the out-the-door-on-to-the-street line at Tao and the fact that the waitress was super pleasant and helpful and the my friends and I played pool uninterrupted until 1:00am pushes me to three stars.  Seriously, sports book meets nightclub? Overpriced drinks? If the staff weren't awesome (I'm talking bouncers, bar tenders, waitresses) this would have been a walk-out place in a second.  The layout was definitely unique. The furniture was modern and comfortable.  The washrooms very nice. Clean, accommodating and private.  My group was populated with prolific over-the-top dancer types so the fact that they were "getting down" all over the place means either that the music was great or that my friends dance their asses of in spite of weak music.  Sounded mediocre/alright.  [summary] looking for a unique spin on sports book? this is your place looking for good value on ambiance and good drinks? probably not your place. looking to dance? well you can do that anywhere, even here. don't want to deal with the massive line a Tao? bring your game face, and your wallet to 40/40.  [end]
2 Dear Jay-z,  I'm sorry I'm not a rapper, a "ballaaaaaaa," nor a rich ass B*tch!  I'm sorry I can't afford your ridiculously-priced drinks!  I'm sorry I do not enjoy your 100 big screen tvs that light the "club."  I'm sorry that your drinks are extremely watered down!  I'm sorry that you add tip automatically to the drink bill.  Most of all, I'm sorry for wasting my time in your spot when I could be drinking for A LOT less at some other venue!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm so not jockin' Jay-Z...  LOVE, Mon
2 We went to watch a baseball game at 4 PM on a friday. I thought "how could this place be THAT bad".. ha  Our waitress well sucked. My bf ordered a "ciroc breeze". she brings a glass of just plain cirOCK (she can't pronounce what she's serving). Then she procedes to be rude with us when we explain, no we wanted the cocktail called circoc breeze "well that's not what you said". HUH, first of all we were sober and I know we were right, and secondly isn't the customer always right?  Drinks are PRICEY even by vegas standards. Think small, ill crafted cocktails for $16-$18. We're talking tiny cups, crappy combinations, etc. I don't mind paying up for a tasty well made drink.. these were just slop in a cup for $16. UGH.  Atmosphere was "cool", but seriously in a sports bar does it make sense that you should only be able to watch 1-2 games at a time? We were seated in the "main part" which was comfy, but seriously we had a view of the main tv and one smaller side tv. Isn't the point of a sports bar to watch MULTIPLE games? On weekends in football season I can't imagine picking  a bar that would only let me watch one game. LAME. Also I was told minimums will be $75 pp during football season. WTF  Also, on friday they had all the staff carry around these stupid plastic bags filled with T-shirts to try to sell you on. So a club with platinum/gold floors selling $16 drinks needs to try to make extra money selling $20 t-shirts? Huh?  The extra star is for the chef who was super friendly and gave us a nice tour and put forth and effort to make sure the game we wanted was on. He was super shady when i asked about Jay Z selling the club,however. He claimed it's all just rumors.. sure...
1 I'd give negative stars if possible.... here's why....  We were involved in the construction as well as the opening of the 40/40 Club and the Palazzo.   Let me just say they didnt pay their bills before they opened (we are still waiting for payment) and they seem to be continuing their wonderful business practices after they opened! Maybe thats why their walking around trying to sell T-Shirts!??!  I will not waist one minute of my time to back to this place, its cool looking inside (thanks to us) but been there, done that... then it opened!!!!
1 I found a coupon for this place. My wife and I go in just after they opened in the late afternoon. The food was pretty good. Some kind of slider mini-hamburgers. Service was OK once they figured out we were there. We had two rounds of mixed drinks. That is four, count them, four drinks total. I'm thinking $40 total, right? It was actually closer to $100. I think the drinks came out to something like $14 each! This wasn't at midnight on a Friday. This was a weekday afternoon with only a few people in there. Extremely overpriced. If Mr. Z is selling it can only get better.
1 RIP.  Closed.  Epic Failure. I have never been so happy to see a place die.  HA, HA, HA.
