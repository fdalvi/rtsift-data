5 This is seriously the greatest BBQ I have ever had!   I used Sin City Smokers to cater an event at my investment office in Las Vegas. They showed up with the huge BBQ smoker rig too!   All of the portions were plenty and everyone couldn't stop talking about the food for days.    I definitely recommend getting the "5 cheese smackeroni and cheese"   Thanks Sin City Smokers!
5 Fantastic Food!!
5 Amaaaaaaazinggggg!!! I could eat this every day for the rest of my life and be totally happy!
5 Take this from a true BBQ fan you will not find better than this anywhere!! I have been fortunate enough to have enjoyed Sin City Smokers multiple times. Each time the Chef prepared the food at competition level quality. I would highly recommend them to anyone. In fact as far as I am concerned this is the only BBQ worth eating.   Oh and I agree with Chris O. The "5 cheese smackeroni and cheese" is of the charts good!!
5 Sin City Smokers makes the most amazing BBQ! The steaks and ribs were seasoned and cooked perfectly! Steve and Shirley were also super cool. Highly recommended!
