5 I really love this location.  The children's section is great. My son loves to play in the kids area and they also have an out door section for him to run around in. We sometimes just go for him to get out and play.   They are always having some sort of event going on for kids and adults like looking at Lizards, jugglers, Legos, and more.  Weekly events for toddler story time is a must for the little ones they have a blast singing and playing.  If you all don't know about the culture passes please look into this!  You can get 2 free admissions to local museums and zoo's.  This is a great way to save money and get out of the house for some fun.  I use them often!!
5 I love this library. The staff is super friendly and the large kid area is a zero cost method for the kiddos to have a blast!  Peoria also has these cultural passes at the front which gives you 2 free tickets to popular area attractions. Great way to spend quality family time without wasting away money!
5 Wow! A few weeks ago I was wondering "who still goes to a library?" Little did I know what great kids programs that libraries offer. I took my baby here for a play group and it was great. We sang songs, had bubbles, and tons of toys to play with. There was even parachute time. Now I am wondering why I am even paying for gymboree when this is offered for free.  The library also has a great kids section with tons of books, computers, toys, and an outside play area. This is the place to go to bring your kids. I am so excited to check out the other classes!
2 I love this library, but the workers can be incredibly rude. There is a few great workers at the library, but a few too many who have ruined my experience at this library and make me flirt with not coming back ever again. They are rude, don't listen to the guests at the library, and nothing adds up. Some librarians will let you do things while others won't and I'm absolutely sick of it. Besides some workers, everything is great.
