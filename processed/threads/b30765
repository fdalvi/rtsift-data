4 I have been to Lorna's a couple of times.  She is very efficient and professional.  I was actually thinking about making an appointment to go see her, when I realized I have not written a review for her.  Her spa is inside another one which can be a little confusing.  I like that she does the whole facial with a microdermabrasion at a reasonable price.  I am also booking an appointment for my hubby.  I have been looking for someone who can go a great back facial and I am sure Lorna can do that wonderfully.
5 Love the way my skin feels after visiting with Lorna. She uses many techniques and customizes your facial. Her prices are also great!
5 The yelp reviewers have spoken! This is THE best place to go for microdermabrasion in the valley. I have received microdermabrasion in the past but this is like being treated like royalty. She gave me a facial, massage, and microdermabrasion and my skin is glowing! I felt so relaxed it definitely took away my stress for the day. I was expecting the cost to be in upwards of $100+ but the price was reasonable at $70. I would highly suggest purchasing the coupon to get more for your money :)
