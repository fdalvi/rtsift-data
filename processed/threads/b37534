4 Frankenstein's was our funny find for the weekend. A very funky bar stretched across three floors we visited on the Saturday night and then when we went back for quick bite to eat on the Sunday night they'd run out of food! Festival run out! Our waiter/bar man was very friendly and accommodating though and found combinations on the menu we could eat. The food isn't high quality but the atmosphere and fun is.
3 Went in here for first time a few weeks ago and was rather dissapointed after what i had heard of it. We had a meal and although it was ok it wasn't worth what we paid for it , drink was rather expensive as well although it was a good pint. Good place to go see if you are a tourist and get a phot taken outside of bar but not a locals bar by any means. Staff were friendly and service was ok.
4 Don't know what's up with all bad reviews. Maybe I came at the wrong time. When I stopped by for lunch, I was the only customer. The food was good and the service great.
