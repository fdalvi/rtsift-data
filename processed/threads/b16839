5 Located behind an eyewear store, just outside of Nordstrom in the Fashion Show Mall, you might miss it, if you walk by! I found Dr. Tran in the VSP provider directory. My insurance covers a part of the exam (can only do either glasses or contacts, not both) and my co-pay was $25. I've been wearing contacts for a decade now. This is the only eye doctor that has found the right contact lens prescription for me- he fixed my astigmatism. It's amazing how clearly I can see now. I'm very pleased.    Aside from being a great eye doctor, his staff is nice and detail-oriented- gave me a $15 rebate on my contacts and explained everything to me. The order is for either 6 mos. or a year's worth of contacts. (If it's not in stock, it gets ordered (prepay), and a week later, you will get a call notifying you that it's ready to pick up.) I had to schedule another appointment to get my eyes dilated (recommended for certain patients- yes, I fall into that category). So, someone has to drive you to the appointment and you can't really go shopping afterward- it will be blurry for about five hours. (And you wear this hideous large temporary eyewrap to shield your eyes from the sunlight. If you don't want to do that, bring your shades.)  It's great when you find someone in the medical field that you can trust here in Las Vegas- heard horror stories. And the location is very convenient for shoppers or if you live nearby- check both of those off for me, please. I will definitely come back, provided that I still have the same insurance coverage. Crossing my fingers.
4 If you're tired of being treated like cattle at LensCrafters, visit Fashion Eye Care for the utmost in professionalism and a well run office.  You will be seen at or very close to your appointment time, get a great exam, and my eye insurance was accepted.  I took one star off because of the location. I hate the fact that it's in the Fashion Show Mall, since it means you can't just park out front and walk
1 My wife and I went here because our insurance covered it.  The doctor didn't do a very thorough job on me and my wife was not given bifocals as she needed and now we we get to spend money on another pair of glasses.  I've worn glasses for twenty-four years. I know what to expect. She did not and this caused big issues.  Thanks doc. Guess that's what we get because we didn't have the HUGE MONEY we'd need to buy expensive frames from next door... So we got a rush job.  Then when she complains the glasses aren't helping anything close up were told it's "only $450 more" to fix.  And they tell us "oh but your insurance won't take a second charge this year!"  So I feel conned. I really do. I'm sure that this isn't their intention however I would be willing to bet that had we been bigger budget customers we would have had a better experience.  Their poor service could have avoided this situation but what do you expect from the optometrist with what's likely the HIGHEST RENT location in all of Nevada?
4 This place was packed on the weekend, with people who appeared to be tourists. I guess it didn't surprise me, since this is Fashion Show Mall. There's also a sign in front of this place that says "Walk-ins Welcome." It appeared that some of them bought glasses next door.  Other than being bombarded with touristy folks, this is a really small, one man shop. The eye exam room is tiny and seemed like a storage closet with contact lens boxes all over the place. I didn't really like how one part of my routine eye exam - where you look into some machine - is in plain view for everyone in the mall to see you. Essentially, you step outside of the doctor's room and look into some machine that's right next to a glass window. I didn't really care much for his receptionist?/assistant. She wasn't as warm and welcoming as Dr. Tran.  Any who, as a doctor, Dr. Tran is really nice and competent. He does take his time and is responsive to questions. He was also really good with follow up too. He returned my phone call after his working hours, which I really appreciate. The price he quoted me for contact lens was fair, and I know this because I compared it with another store. He fitted me for glasses and reshaped them to fit my head.   I really wish I didn't have to go through hubbub of Fashion Show Mall just to get to him.
2 ok enough doctor but his new receptionist / front office staff needs to be more pleasant.  i was previously a patient but just made a new appointment at a different office.  sign outside says walk-ins welcome but have been to the mall with the office closed a few times.  seems to cater more to tourists now as it is located in fashion show mall.
5 Dr. Tran is excellent - my wife, my daughter and I all go to him for our vision care. He is patient, caring and very expert. He helped me resolve my muti-focal contacts with astigmatism issues like no other doctor before him has been able to do.  I actually like the location in FS Mall - do multiple things in one trip. Highly recommended!
4 I've purchased a pair of glasses at this store and taken an eye exam a couple of times with Dr. Tran next door, and the experience at both establishments have been good for the most part. Dr. Tran was very thorough in making sure I got the right prescription for my glasses. He even had me come in several times (without charging any extra fee) because my prescription had changed over a short period due to my dry eyes. He also sold some eye drops specifically made for contact lens wearers with dry eyes, and this helped alleviate my condition. On the down side, he did not detect my mild astigmatism, and I found this out from another optometrist.  As for the store, I was fortunate enough to find a very caring and knowledgeable sales person. I unfortunately forgot his name since it's been a while, but he hooked me up with a wonderful and tres chic pair of pink Fendi glasses. While looking for the perfect pair, he took into account the shape and size of my face as well as my age, and I love, love, love the glasses that he chose! It was the type of tailored service that I would never find at a local Lenscrafters or other national chains. Fashion Eye Care has a great selection of high-end and fashionable brands. On the down side, because their items are more on the high end, the price will also cost you a pretty penny.
1 I was in town for business and got a horrible eye infection. Fashion Eyecare was the only place open on a Saturday evening so I set an appointment and headed right over.   When I arrived, I handed over my insurance card. The lady promptly made a copy with my DL, and then said they did not take my insurance and that I would have to pay $60 for the visit. I said that was fine and got everything checked out and a prescription. Before I left , i was told it would be $110 for the visit instead. Okay, whatever, as long as my eye got better.   Shortly thereafter, I picked up my Rx and my eye seemed to be getting worse. I flew back home 2 days later and saw my regular Optometrist who told me I was given the wrong medication! I had a VIRAL eye infection not a BACTERIAL eye infection!! To top everything off, I just received notice that they billed my insurance company $170!!!! So my total visit's cost? $280. The cost of my Optometrist back home? $50.   Save your money, time, and frustration. Go somewhere, anywhere, else.
5 Very friendly and accommodating. Didn't try to upsell me or push glasses on my kids that didn't need them.
5 I've been examined by Dr. Tran of Fashion Eye Care for several years now, both before I became a resident of the Las Vegas valley, and since.  I've always found him to be meticulous in testing eyesight, and prescribing new prescription lenses.  He has the latest testing instruments, and knows his craft well.  With Diane, Dr. Tran has also proven to be a master of the latest available contact lens products, and has been generous in providing her with various types of trial contact lenses to try at no extra charge beyond the cost of a comprehensive eye examination, before the best personal fit is determined and ordered.  Optica of Las Vegas next door inside Fashion Show also offers a discount on eyewear (eyeglasses and sunglasses) whose lenses are prescribed by Dr. Tran.  I highly recommend Dr. Tran as an optometrist!
5 Been seeing Dr. Tran for about 4 years he is very good and I recommend him for eye care and glasses.
