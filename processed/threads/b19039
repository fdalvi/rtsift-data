3 automobile insurance.  I looked into a few suppliers all of whom had similar "rates" but the coverages varied. One thing I did notice, was Uninsured Motorist coverage. Vastly different in the rates between a couple of companies.  With the news you read here in the Las Vegas valley of prescription drug abuse. And the number of accidents you may see daily as you drive around town, a town with a potential of "free" drinks in the driver's system. Uninsured / Under Insured was critical in my opinion. If you have superb Health benefits at work. No need then.  So I went with AAA (Triple A). I was getting the Roadside Service anyways with the concerns of what the Heat here has on batteries, belts, and even tires. I wanted that Yellow Truck on my side.  Only downside may be a "Membership" fee of $71 for the first year. Down to $50 thereafter if I'm not mistaken.   They serve NorCal, Nevada, and Utah.
2 Someone mentioned that AAA gives out free guide books to its members, so I popped in here last week to see what I could get for my upcoming trips to Peru and Japan.  They told me they had no guidebooks for anywhere outside the US, and they came back with a fold up world map.  Umm yeah, thanks a lot, that's really helpful.
1 Rudest dispatchers I've ever had to deal with made my situation even worse wanted to leave my kids and I in the 103 degree heat for 2 1/2 hours. No thanks! try anyone else but them! American towing there in 30 yes please!!! Indian springs towing in from Indian springs be there in 45 yes please! 2 1/2 hours wait in the heat can't leave the car. What a joke! You guys should be ashamed of your service and your employees
