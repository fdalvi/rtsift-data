2 Mom and I decided to check this place out when a cousin and her soon-to-be 18-year-old daughter visiting from NJ went to check out Forever 21 (a store I've never found anything I wanted to purchase from).  Love Culture has some very cute clothing!  Inexpensive, too-  I was able to find four fun spring-summery tops (between $13-$22) I could actually wear under a suit for work.    Brightly-lit, colorful, and nicely-spaced aisles.  Staff seemed friendly enough.  Am not a fan of their return policy, though.  I was only told about the 22-day policy at checkout, and nothing about how sale items, shoes, and accessories were final sale.  Only found out about the latter when I wanted to return a purse the next day, only to be told that it could not be returned per policy which was printed on the back of the receipt.  I went around the area where the purses and shoes were, and NOWHERE, not even at the check-out counter, were there any signs that mentioned final sale.  I'd still visit to see what pretty clothing I may find, but I'd definitely think thrice about purchasing from their shoes, accessories, and sale items.
5 one of the best places to shop... its "BETTER THAN FOREVER 21" the prices vary from 5$-40$ nothing over... amazing fashion. they have a section of nothing but accesories and belts i love it from bras to earings to belts to soxs and panties this is an amazing store great suites dresses shoes."WHATEVER IT IS THEY HAVE IT HERE GARANTEED" IF NOT FIND ME AND KILL ME LOL
