4 Great little chocolate shop that does all their truffles on site. If you look friendly and wander around enough the owner eventually will offer you a sample of one or two. Things are on the expensive side but it warrants the occasional visit.  Aside from truffles, my personal favourite are the "Seeds of Happiness", which are little round globules of dark chocolate. The store also carries the best homemade iced cream in Waterloo. For the quality, it is a good bargain (I've been sold since my first taste of pumpkin ginger).
5 I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place and go for lunch often. They have this great "prix fixe" menu that includes a soup, salad, main course, and dessert for $10. The portions aren't huge but as a meal, it's very satisfying. All the food is freshly prepared and they use a lot of local produce. Plus, their chocolates are amazing.   Service is always polite and friendly. Sometimes, they can get a bit backlogged so give yourself a full hour for the meal, but like  I said, always friendly.  They also do afternoon tea. I've never been myself but I hear good things about it.   You should definately check this place out if you like good old fashioned comfort food in a cute setting.
5 I had their prix-fixe lunch as well and it was excellent. The soup was made from scratch, and very thick and creamy and satisfying. Same with their hot chocolate. I was a bit sick on that day but felt so much better after gulping down their smooth, tasty hot chocolate. _____________________________________________________ Today I went to their high tea (reservation only on Sundays and Mondays from 1pm - 4pm). The price is 15.75 per person and includes a three course meal filled with petite sandwiches and pastries and other delightful desserts. Each course is served with a pot of tea. First, is English breakfast tea with trays of tiny scones, muffins, and Yorkshire pudding served with berry jam/ginger honey/lemon custard as well as some cream. Very delicious. I enjoyed pretty much everything. Second course is their flowering tea (tastes like jasmine tea that I have at home, but looks very pretty since it blooms in the pot), and some sandwiches and filo pastry filled with cheese + mushrooms. If you are not vegetarian like I am, you will have something else on there too with ham. Final course is chai tea with strawberry cake (so soft and moist) and dark chocolate something (it had a strong taste of rum and I loved it). The whole set was well worth the money and I really enjoyed the food as well as the pretty china tea sets that it was served in. The servers were very friendly and prompt (refilled our milk right away and explained in detail what was served). I probably drank too much tea in a short period of time, so I had to go to the washroom many times. All in all it was lovely. Next time I would probably go a bit earlier and spend my whole afternoon there.
5 Just did the afternoon tea/high tea over the weekend. Best decision I've ever made. It was a three course tea with food. Started with an english breakfast, some mini scones, Yorkshire pudding, and fruit cake. This was served with strawberry preserves, lemon curd, ginger honey and clotted cream. The second course was a flowering tea with mini sandwiches, orderves, and mini meat pies. Third course was a chai tea (which was amazing) and desert. All was very fresh and delicious.
4 A cute restaurant that was great for our weekend brunch - definitely a nice getaway from the university students' pub and fast food diet! Place was very busy and had to wait a little bit for a seat in their small dining room. $10 brunch was pretty good for the price, considering u get the baked goods and coffee alongside your main dish (try their omelettes!). They also have high tea and fondue options - not bad for a restaurant in the KW area, but if u are expecting a high tea experience comparable to toronto's windsor arms, then u would be expecting far too much unfortunately :(
