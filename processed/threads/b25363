5 Brake Masters definitely set our minds at ease today. We had towed our car behind our RV and accidentally left the emergency brake on, while towing about 1 hour. When we arrived at our destination, we were horrified to see that as a result, the emergency brake did not work at all and of course, worried that the whole braking system might be messed up. We drove into BM and within 1/2 hour our car was test driven,  all the wheels were taken off and the brakes examined and cleaned. It was determined that nothing was damaged and emergency brake was reset. We were charged for a mere 1/2 labour and breathed a sigh of relief. Fabulous service and we were very grateful.. Would highly recommend this location.
1 I've generally used them for oil changes and it has been fine except for always trying to upsell us on various "flushes."  I recently took my Honda in for an oil change and asked them to check the power steering fluid because the steering wheel has been vibrating and moaning.  They told me it was fine.  I took it to another mechanic for 90K service and asked them to check the power steering fluid.  They told me it was absolutely NOT fine and required multiple flushes.  When I got my car back, voila!  No more moaning and vibrating (which is generally not a bad thing but not what I want in my vehicle).  Shame on BM for either missing this or not even looking at it.
1 The service was rude and when I left my car there for nearly two hours they still couldn't manage to get the oil change done by the time they said they would.
3 I have been pleased with the quality of their work.  I found that it's best to make an appointment with them otherwise you could be waiting for a while.  It is a bit annoying to be up-sold each time for a long list of things.  I have a 7 year old car that is in good shape.  I don't need to be told about a lot of unnecessary things to fix.  I do believe that they're honest and their prices are competitive.
