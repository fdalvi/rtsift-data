4 Love Big 5, very good prices and the service is always very good.  I keep trying to go other places but find myself back here a lot.  Great variety of shoes, camping, sporting, guns, ammo, toys, games, and I just came here the other day to get a smoking deal on hiking shoes for $20 that were regularly $50!
3 I up and decided wearing a flannel shirt as a light sweater during those interim few weeks in Arizona where you need something for a few hours in the morning and a heavy lined flannel is too much.  I searched a half dozen places on the net and it seemed Big 5 had a pretty good selection.  I had never been in a Big 5 before and found it a bit crowded and I had trouble figuring out how the store was laid out.  While I didn't find exactly what I was looking for in my price range I found a zip front fleece that was serviceable and when fall comes I will start watching their ads to find a backup for when it is in the wash.
1 If I could leave negative stars I would. The manager was chasing an employee flirting as my husband and I were trying to ask where to find a hiking GPS he immediately barked "what!" We turned around and walked out and he began shouting incessantly "have a great day" sarcastically all the way out to the parking lot. We will never go back! Douches!
1 When I asked a employee for help with shoes he tried to run off and not help me. If you are busy just say so I will not get offended by that. Just tell me so.
