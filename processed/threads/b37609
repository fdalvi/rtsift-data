5 Went over & beyond to fix a Bad Delivery. Replaced the arrangement in less than 24 hours! Honorable business! Thank You!
1 Received Valentines flowers from my husband... Sweethearts bouquet ordered thru FTD...hubby paid for the "Better" selection at $54.99 + tax & delivery & I got the worst!  This bouquet is supposed to have 10 roses and have burgundy mini carnations not pink.  I can handle the pink carnations it came with, but 3 roses really!?  Their "Good" selection says it comes with 7 stems of roses.  Even if there was a shortage of roses due to the holiday they should have called him to see if he wanted to replace them with something else.   Apparently they can't deliver a new bouquet today so they took $20 off...what the hell?  That's still a rip off!  These should be completely free!  Good job at ruining a sweet gesture, thieves.
5 I received a Mother's Day bouquet.  Pros:  pretty arrangement. They were definitely not cheap on the quality of flowers! Beautiful vase too not one of those generic acrylic type but it was ceramic and pretty to use even after it time to throw out the flowers.  Arrangement was still alive. In the past I received arrangements from other places in which the flowers seem to be wilting. Not here!  The delivery driver was a sweetheart. With crying kids wanting my attention she just took her time and was very patient. She also caught my chihuahua as it tried to make an escape.   Cons: Delivery was late. 8pm and they still deliver. I know it's a busy holiday but damn I was putting the kids to bed (hence why they started to cry) and ding dong went my doorbell. Maybe try to keep it in the 9-6 window ?
