5 This is a newer doggy day care and boarding facility.   I am so happy with the extra special care my little beagle mix, Olive has experienced.  The staff clearly love these four legged furry friends and make an extra effort to make the doggy parents feel at ease knowing their angels are in the best of hands. I've tried other places...and have not been happy.  This facility is Sparkling clean and the knowledgeable staff is eager to please and sincerely care about my puppy.
5 I completely disagree with Katie B.'s assessment. My dog had to be spayed before coming here. All dogs go through an initial assessment to see if they have the right temperament for dog daycare. I have been there 10 times and not ever seen dogs fighting. The employees are terrific: always smiling, happy to help, and they obviously love dogs. This place is super clean. My dog LOVES coming here, and gets so excited when we get in the car to come here. I have even boarded my dog here for 5 days, and she did great. The nice part about boarding is that daycare is included, so she got to play all day, rather than sitting in a large kennel for most of the day as she would have done at other boarding facilities.
5 I am what you call a "Crazy Pet Mom." I believe that my dog should receive great care- no matter how expensive or not expensive the location is- as she is a family member and if I am paying for a service, I expect great treatment.   With that said, I have visited SIX doggie daycare and boarding facilities throughout Madison and I have to say that Dogtopia is my #1 choice. Here is a quick rundown:     -Dog Haus, far east side, boarding: I left my dog here for her first boarding experience and my friend picked her up for me. She noticed that no food was missing from her THREE DAY boarding stay when she asked, she was told, "The owner instructed us not to feed her." Um, then WHY would I send her food? Next...    -Ruffin' it Resorts daycare: I see Ruffin' it equivalent to Dogtopia. They cap their numbers for daycare and the owner and staffs are wonderful. Luckily, for them, they have a great reputation and book up months in advance for boarding and daycare. But one half day a week for daycare was not going to cut it so I had to look elsewhere. Darn it...        -Waggin' Tails daycare and boarding: Another great facility from the outside but I am not sure what it's like behind closed doors. My dog used to have no problem doing daycare/boarding at this facility but after two instances where I was dropping her off, she lurched back to come at me and pulled and pulled. I removed her from the facility. Unfortunately, employees who have worked there- don't have great things to say about it but not sure how accurate it is? Blarg...     -Camp K9 boarding: A great daycare facility but I was disappointed that my dog that would be boarded for 5-8 days (I had work trips) would only get 2-15 minute play time breaks unless I paid for additional daycare time, and when you have an energetic dog that's extremely disappointing. Cost to put her at Dogtopia was $5 less a day. I am still going...     -Happy Dogs daycare, Fitchburg: My dog came out one day with a bit ear and no one pointed it out to me. I walked back in the facility and asked about it. No one could tell me what happened or how. And then blamed my dog for rough housing which could have been the case but give me a good story to make me believe that you were at least watching the dogs. PS This facility puts WAY too many dogs in the same room... no wonder they didn't catch the bite...        -Windogs: What a mess. My dog has a problem with incontinence and I told the owners/team about this when I dropped her off. I said, "If she wets the bed, please remove it." 7 days later when I return from my business trip to pick up the dog, I am told she had a couple accidents on her bed but that they cleaned them up. I take her bed and- NO JOKE- urination squeezed off the bed and into my hand. To make matters worse, the bed LEFT A STAIN in my car and I was forever traumatized. Spend more...  This led me to venture to Dogtopia who I was reluctant about visiting based off the cost but I knew Ruffin' It would not be able to handle my travel schedule with the length of reservations.   And let me tell you, I am so happy that I went to Dogtopia. Dogtopia did an assessment and invited my dog to spend the remainder of her day at Dogtopia. I was able to watch her on the webcams and was shocked when I saw that the dogs were "napping" because the caretakers were moping the floors in the MIDDLE of the day. Talk about a clean building/facility! Plus, I think its a GREAT idea to give the dogs a break, even as humans, we can only tolerate each other so much throughout a day.   Dogtopia has always welcomed my dog and I to the facility with smiles when we entered and report cards when we left. While I was traveling for work (8 days), I boarded my dog and I got regular daily updates on my girl. I think my dog missed Dogtopia after returning home....   And even when my girl had her problems with her incontinence and the bed, Dogtopia cleaned her blankets, sent me an email, and took care of it. What a difference!  So yes, Dogtopia tends to be more expensive than other facilities but I have never been so happy, comfortable and relaxed about leaving my four-legged friend at the facility. Thank you Dogtopia!
