4 12,000 feet full of antiques and vintage finds. Red Rooster is located off the Las Vegas strip. Plan to spend a few hours here to rummage through. Red Rooster consists of different rooms with many treasures such as cookbooks from the 1920's to vintage furniture. The exterior of the building is a bit frightening and run down but it really isn't as scary as it seems. I spent about 2 hours here not just looking to buy, but was impressed with all the different knicknacks from different eras. I would have stayed a lot longer if I didn't already have plans. Can't wait to go back! Definitely worth checking out next time u are in Vegas!
4 The Red Rooster is a delight of a place to spend an afternoon meandering through just looking at the immense amount of stuff they have. Rivaled only be the (now defunct?  I believe?) Sampler Shoppes, this place is the largest one-stop antique place in town.  You can find everything from periodicals to jewelry to furniture to tchotchkes to clothes - anything you can imagine, really.  The people are usually pretty nice, although their knowledge may be limited.  Haggling is sometimes worth it, so it's definitely OK to try.  Wander through, smell those old-thing smells, and have a blast even if you don't qualify for an AARP card yet.  Antiquing ain't just for old peeps!
4 I love Red Rooster Antique Mall. It's great to spend a Sunday afternoon looking around here at all the cool antiques. I used to come here specifically for my tiki bar collection stuff. I bought a great vintage tiki bar here. They took their tiki section out, but you can still find tiki stuff in some of their other booths.  When I went this past Sunday they had some new vintage clothing areas that I liked. The only thing that bothers me is that it's kind of inconvenient to get to because you can't enter off of Charleston. Also, their stuff has gotten to crammed in there to where you have to tippy toe around some of the areas because there is so much stuff. Other than that, I like it.
2 What a shame...this store is closing after 21 years in business.  The family that owns the Red Rooster is moving to Illinois.  The lady that runs the place was very friendly and told me this after I inquired about the closing 7/15/10 sign on the door.  They used to have multiple floors and many rooms.  Now, they are reduced to a garage sale amount of stuff that appears to have been picked over.  I am sure this was a 4 or 5-star place at one time, however that day has passed.  The good news is that the Charleston Antique Mall is in full swing literally next door.  Go there instead.
3 This is the new, renovated location that is a bit smaller, but cleaner, better lit and has a slightly higher caliber of dealers than it previously had.  I want to go four and a half stars to three vendors:  One: Mary always has a wide variety of items that span the size gap from furniture to smaller vintage items. What can I say about someone who just sold me a 6ft Marlin? Two thumbs up. The irony is not lost on me. Must have been gotten from a Florida transplant. Oh well, glad Mary had the eye to find it. I like the fact her space is open and the items display well.  Which leads me to two: Alan and his lovely wife ( who is my favorite person here bar none ) are really a store within a store. They have a really great eye for the coolest retro and vintage items you can imagine. I've bought many a vintage silk tie here, as well as Hawaiian touristy bric-a-brac, and kitchenware. THE most colorful space anywhere. They are really designers in disguise and are great to work with.   Third: The Tiki room is always fun. Many a tiki mug has passed thru here. And visually, this is a fun spot. Even if I don't buy, I'm always eyeing something I haven't seen before. Most fun space to be in by a mile.  Sadly, the rest of the spaces get a meager two stars. Lots and lots of glass and items rummaged from Savers and yard sales. Every once in awhile something unique will show up, but not as often as would be nice.   So hit the middle aisles first. They tend to be best. And good luck hunting.
1 Out of Business. Building has been vacant for a couple years. Will be torn down as part of the freeway expansion.
