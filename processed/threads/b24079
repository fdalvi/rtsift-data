5 We are new to the Madison area, and the move across the country stressed our cat out terribly.  He was having bladder issues, and behaving extremely aggressively when we would try to take him to a local vet clinic.  We figured we would try a mobile vet to see if staying at home would keep him calmer.  Luckily this idea worked out wonderfully.  Dr. Lisa came into our apartment and took her time in letting our cat sniff her out and relax.  She was extremely kind and patient, played with him and gave him treats...it was easy to see she truly loved animals and wanted to help.  Our cat was so much more calm and comfortable with this situation rather than being in a strange room at a clinic.    I've had pets my whole life, but this was my first time using a mobile vet.  I must say, going this route far exceeds having to deal with the stressful process of going to the vet!  Dr. Lisa is wonderful, and we will certainly be using her as our veterinarian going forward.
5 Dr. Lisa really cares about the well-being of your animals and always makes sure you pet receives quality care. We have 2 cats and a dog that she cares for and the mobile factor really helps out as well. I don't know what we would do without her great services.
5 Dr. Lisa is an excellent vet.  Her mobile clinic makes it much easier for our cat (who hates car rides!).  She has cared for our cat for several years, and her rates are very reasonable.  She is very knowledgeable and has a clean, well equipped mobile clinic.  She not only does standard annual check-ups, but will also perform most other types of testing right in her lab, with quick results.  She also never pressures us into expensive, possibly unnecessary testing like some other vets.  She has a great bedside manner, and we couldn't recommend her more highly.  I rarely write on-line reviews, but really wanted to spread the word about Dr. Lisa!
