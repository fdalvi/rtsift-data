1 Wow wow wow! Looks like mostly the 60 & over crowd work & shop here & they don't take kindly to young 'uns trying to invade their turf. At least that's how they come across. Rude, unprofessional, & condescending. Guess what? The manager was the worst one! There was another woman in there asking for an application who was also treated badly. I got the message & left without buying anything. Later the same day I went to the Gilbert location on Market & the difference was night & day. Friendly people, professional, & courteous. Skip the one in Mesa on Main Street...it's like that old black & white movie Village of the Damned, but with old ladies.
1 Never have I seen such unhappy employees! I also work in retail and I would never treat my customers as an inconvenience to be in my store. Sighing in front of customers because they brought a discount printed out from the store website is beyond terrible customer service.
1 This is the WORST JoAnn's I have ever been in!  Everything is complete disarray -- looked like a tornado had just gone through. Their inventory was minimal at best.  Walmart has a much better selection of yarn, fabrics, beading supplies.   This place was like ghetto!!!!!!
