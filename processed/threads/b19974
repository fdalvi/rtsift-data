4 The bomb Indian takeaway in Stockbridge.  Quick, clean, friendly, tasty, cheap, and plentiful.  A must have alternative to the surrounding chippers.  Holy crap, I just had an awesome idea.  Fish and chips with curry.....mmm.....
5 Great food and fast delivery- there was an extra dish in the bag, but so tasty we didn't mind the bump in price :)
