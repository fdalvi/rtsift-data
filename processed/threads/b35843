3 VERY small farmers market. About ten or so vendors. A few sell produce, a handful sell handmade goods, a honey guy, a shaved ice(hawaiian style) truck, and some other random vendors.. can't really remember. I usually go there to buy my fruit, I like supporting local businesses.   I've been spoiled by really great Farmers Markets being that I've lived in Portland, Oregon where the PSU Farmers Market is OFF THE HOOK!!! And I also, live in Vancouver, BC where they have the Granville Market.. Miss that place! So you can see I have very high standards when it comes to a farmers market. But... I'll give any farmers market a look and check it out.  Would I recommend this particular one, maybe not this location. I prefer when they are at the Eastern Ave location, the parking lot where BJ's restaurant is. They have more vendors there.
5 Fresh52 always has the kindest vendors with the best products!!!!  Town Square is pretty small, only a few booths, but still worth the trip to get some fresh veggies and fruit along with the extremely delicious food from Vegout!  Every Friday, Saturday and Sunday Fresh52 puts on a great farmers market.  So lucky to have them in town to share the healthy products they provide.
3 its small. I was a bit disappointed.   first booth Veggies. (from California) hummus and pita chips at another. jerky at one. home made soy candles STRAWBERRIES (fresh picked morning of) **TASTY** A man singing and playing a guitar.  and a few others.   Located just outside of Whole Foods.     I thought the veggies were a bit over priced. but its Vegas right, we can't grow produce here easily.  Friendly and some pushy sellers.  Lots of parking with the chosen venue of town square. goes from 3p -7p I believe
4 I grew up in Hawaii in a small town of Hilo and one of my fondest memories as a child was our weekly trip to the outdoor farmers market. I like the location of this farmers market because my kids and I frequent Town square often and it is a pretty central location to many of the places we need to be throughout the day. It is not a big market but I love support to small businesses. The first time I tried a fresh persimmon was from the fruit lady, my kids loved the blood oranges and apples,  I pick up the yummy Mediterranean quinoa salad from one vendor, a cup of cafe latte with almond milk from the coffee lady who is so sweet, a bottle of fresh pomegranate juice from the nice man at the end, and last but not least, my kids and I LOVE the tacos from the Garden Grill! Awesome Customer Service and delicious VEGAN flavorful Food. I really hope to see this farmers market grow, there is so much potential here.
