3 I visited the Slanted Clam to see a friend's band play and wasn't able to sample their food offerings, but as far as a music venue the place was....interesting.  The stage is in a room completely separate from the bar, which seemed very odd to me.  The southwestern decor was something I wasn't expecting to see during a rock and roll show.  The bar was crowded and the service was pretty slow; it took a while for the bartender to even notice we were, and after he took our order he milled about a bit before he got our beverages.  (I know my order of a bottle of water must have been difficult to procure.)  The sound was OK.  Not unlike a band playing in someone's house; just your typical sound for a place that wasn't really designed for music.  However, unlike a lot of places that decided to just put a stage in, this one is pretty good sized and was able to carry the 4 piece group without them seeming crowded.  There were some nice pool tables near the entrance, and the people milling around the bar seemed to be having a good time.  My coworker just gave me a few free drink coupons for this place so I'll be going back.  Perhaps that'll help me have a more favorable impression of the Clam.
2 Mediocre bar with nothing special.  No food in house, they hand you menus. Bad.  One star was for the impossibly hot waitress who obviously doesn't realize she should be stripping for 50x's the money instead of working at that place.
1 this is now a mexican bar w/ a hot dog cart out front on the weekends. Marinos De Camillo or something like that. Very small parking lot but the only bar in the neighborhood
