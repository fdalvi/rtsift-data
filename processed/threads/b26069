3 Great food at reasonable prices with friendly service!
1 Me and a lady in my office ordered here on a Tuesday and had it delivered. My pizza and fries were great. It did take them over an hour for delivery but that was fine. My complaint is when we called on Friday to order again the guy that answered just said "hello" and was really rude. I told him I wanted a delivery and he asked where and I told him and he said "No to far". I explained we just ordered a couple days ago and he said "No to far", almost mad and yelling. I said the driver gave us 10 menus for next time and he again said "no" and then he hung up on me. Very rude service and we will not be back.
5 Try their Calamari. It's the Bomb.com
1 Horrible customer service! Ordered a pizza with extra cheese NO extra cheese, but had hair baked into the pizza!! We threw the pizza out, they wanted us to return the pizza. Who wants a new pizza after that?! The order taker also cussed me out when I told her the customer service was terrible. We only wanted a partial refund because I mean really who wants to eat there again. Stay away from this place!
