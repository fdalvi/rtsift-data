5 I could live on this corner forever as long as Mr Trini would be there. Sonoran Hot Dogs... piled with beans, jalapenos, onions, tomatoes, gaucamole and mustard.. the freshest bread (bun) ever.. you can also get cheese, mushrooms and mayo... all of this for 3 bucks.. I would pay 5 easily!!!!!
5 I've been going to this establishment for the past five years! I literally walk there all the time since it's super close to my house. Just kidding! I've only walked there once because my car broke down lol. Anyways, their hot dogs are to die for! I've tried so many Sonoran hotdogs in AZ and none come close to Mr. Triny's! Their champurrado is the best Mexican hot drink to have during the winter time. I am not the only one obsessed with these hotdogs so it's my family! We love Don Triny. He is so nice and welcoming :) great service!
5 Muy fantastico!!!  Mr. Triny is a very friendly guy and sells some of the best Mexi hotdogs. $3 a dog is a great price. Stop by, say hi and wave to the passing cars! They don't know what they're missing!!
4 It wasn't like the sonoran hotdogs down in tucson that I have had. But this was a pretty good one for what I've had up here in phoenix.  A little pricey for a sonoran hot dog.  Just incase you want to comment on how i said it was pricey, read it in the context first... FOR A SONORAN HOT DOG.
