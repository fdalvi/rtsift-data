5 Rachel is amazing! This was seriously one of the most pain free Brazilians I've ever experienced. Her wax was the perfect temperature and never felt too hot. Everything was very sanitary. Her room is decorated so adorably! I would highly recommend going to see Rachel. She is much more personal and attentive than one of those quick wax chain places.  Great experience! Will be back!
5 So in love with this place! Rachel was so attentive to the way I wanted my brows and made sure they were perfect before I left! Her skills with lash extensions are unmatched as she was very efficient and knowledgeable about the entire process including aftercare. Her adorable studio made me feel right at home and her wax was the perfect temperature. If you're looking for someone to take care of your waxing/extension needs I definitely recommend Rachel!
5 I'm from out of town and was looking for a place that was clean, professional and comfortable to get my Brazilian. Waxetera is the place to go! Not only is it affordable, but she offers a wide range of waxing services and products. Rachel is very professional and makes you feel totally comfortable. She did a fantastic job. Too bad she doesn't work in California! Whenever I visit I will definitely be calling Waxetera!
