5 As Realtor myself I can tell you that Wendy is one of the best.  Not only does she deliver the results her clients are looking for, she does so in way that represents her clients to the max.
5 Wendy McCroskey is one of the most compassionate, caring, and thorough Realtors I have ever come across.  She genuinely cares about her clients and takes a real interest in them.  One of the most impressive parts of Wendy's services is her Buyer Consultation in which she often spends an hour or more on the front end getting to know her clients and educate her clients on how best to find a home that fits their needs.  I highly recommend Wendy for your next home purchase in Arizona!
5 I am always educated when Wendy provides information on the Real Estate market in the Valley of the Sun.  She is a constantly studying the trends for buyers and sellers and is passionate about taking care of her customers.  She is truly committed to helping them "win"!  It is therefore easy to recommend Wendy to anyone buying a home, selling a home, or interested in learning more about real estate in Arizona.  She is more than a Realtor - she is a Real Estate Educator!
5 Wendy is incredible. She educates her homebuyers and helps them to feel comfortable and relaxed when purchasing their home. I've very lucky to know her. Thank you Wendy.
