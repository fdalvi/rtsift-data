5 I bought a 2004 moped used that was originally from here, then upgraded to a 'motorcycle' scooter from here last year- a 2009 Kymco People 150. I loved both of the scooters and love scooter therapy!   The owner, Randy, is amazing- he's super knowledgable and honest. At times he seems as though he is not listening, but always is- i think it's just his personality.  He answers all questions, even my silly questions, and seems to tollerate a lot- and has been at the shop almost every time I've stopped by.  The entire staff, however, also seems to know a lot about all mopeds/scooters   They will even pick your scooter up anywhere in Madison for only a $10 charge, which is super convenient
5 Randy and crew are excellent! I own a Honda Passport and have brought it to ST several times for a variety of ills. Randy treats the machine like his own. Sometimes he'll tell me that, over and above what I thought needed fixing, he found this and that and fixed it, frequently without charge. Madison is lucky to have Scooter Therapy! They're very responsive and conscientious.
