1 Do not recomend, their finance plan is a total ripoff
5 After many many years in pain, and afraid of the Chiropractor, I met Dr. Chrissy in a networking group.  After a few months of listening to her educate us about the equipment they had which eliminated the cracking noise (which is what I was afraid of) I went to see her office.  I was convinced!  We took X-Rays and got started on my pain.  I then brought my teenage son in who has always had pain in his lower back, and we started working on repairing all the years of childrens sports!  I would always recommend Dr. Chrissy and Dr. Scott to all my friends and family!
1 Don't waste your time!!! I was told by a friend to go there and it's a joke. I was told on the phone I would be meeting with the Chiro today and that didn't happen. I first met with the office manager. She stated that I would have to meet with a Nurse Practitioner before I could get X-rays or see the Dr and it has to be the one in their office. She said even if I did all of that today, I still wouldn't get an adjustment today. The chiropractor is in the Network for my INS but the NP isn't! Wtf?!?! It would have cost me $150 for just today and that's still leaving their office in pain. What a joke!!
