4 Specialising in mussels, oysters and scallops this was the first proper restaurant we headed to an we weren't disappointed withour scallop starters and 1kg pots of mussels for mains. Yummy. Lines out the door during Festival season as no bookings are taken. However turnover was pretty quick and we luckily didn't have to wait too long.
4 I'm still too ashamed to return to this restaurant.   On what was supposed to be a study break in my first year of university my friend and I instead opted for a spot of afternoon drinking. I was missing my boyfriend who was studying in London at the time and my buddy was looking to cheer me up. Four or five drinks later we stumbled into the Mussel Inn because clearly seafood would help out our alcohol lined stomachs. We ate mussels and clams and basket after basket of bread. I remember raving about the garlicky taste and drunkenly asking the waiter to compliment the chef. We also drank some more... I have vague memories of being very loud and asking to play with a nearby tables toddler. They said no.   Two hours later I was on the Sleeper train to London...
3 This came recommended from a tiny popup-map guidebook we picked up, and it didn't disappoint mostly.    The starters were very good, but I was astounded to see that queen scallops are about the size of my smaller fingernails (and i'm a girl!!!). The mussels were good too, but they didn't leave enough of the cooking juice in as the Belgians do and that was a shame.    Generally food was good. The only real disappointment was that for the whole evening, and indeed the next day too, our clothes smelled so horribly of fish that it was nearly unbearable!!
4 The Mussel Inn hosts some high quality fish based dishes. Such high quality is present in the mussel dishes they serve.   Nestling in a big rustic pot, available in plenty of delicious varieties (Shallot being my choice), and accompanied by some chunky bread are the Mussel Inn's showpiece: you guessed it, Mussels. If your feeling macho you can even order a kilo of the unsightly gems, around £12 for that liberty.  One word of warning: you may arrive smelling of sweet perfume and with freshly washed skin, but by the time you exit your clothes will stink of garlic infused cooking oil and other kitchen smells.   It's all part of a decent dining experience though.
4 The Mussel Inn offers great food, competitive prices and a superb location. I came here the other day for the fabulous lunch deal where I chose a bowl of mussels with fries and a glass of white wine for only £7.50, what a bargain! Service was really quick and I think that this menu is designed for people of their work break so the fast service ensures they get back on time, how considerate! The mussels were amazing if a little bit messy to eat, but I'm really messy anyway. The portion was large and the red pepper dressing I opted for was amazing.  We sat outside and I actually felt like I was on holiday watching all the people walking along Rose Street, it was a glorious day!
4 With branches in Edinburgh and Glasgow, the Mussel Inn has long been established as a good seafood restaurant. But with freshly opened Seadogs muscling in on Mussel Inn's turf, it might have to up its game just a little.  Saying that, I always find this establshment consistently good, with efficient service as Eleanor suggested. With its plain but pleasant decor and no fuss approach to dining, their menu is easy enough to figure out. You have the option of choosing mussles ans scallops with a variety of delicious sauces which are always creamy and bring out the flavour of the seafood without drowning them. I have vowed to try them all in my time but can recommend the cheesy sauce and, a more recent venture, the spicier option.   As Eleanor rightly outlined, Mussel Inn seems to cater well to its potential business customers who are looking for a quick but tasty lunch. It's also a good place to try seafood for the first time as their mussels are delicious, but if you happen to chicken out they also do pasta. It's a messy first date because, if you're like me, you will practically shove your face in that bowl to hoover the gorgeous mussels up, but I quite like the hands on approach to dining! A firm favourite, it still goes does swimmingly well.
4 Mmmmm, I like mussels. I know some people get a bit squeamish about mussels because they just look a bit squishy and like there's a bit too much going on inside them, but quite honestly there's nothing I like better than a nice lunch or dinner involving mussel chomping. I think it's also the novelty of prising open shells and scooping up the sauce which makes me warm to a good mussel dish, as it makes the whole experience extra fun. Now I've made myself sound like an infant that needs to be entertained while she's eating....anyway, if you're passionate about mussels and other related seafoodie delights, the Mussel Inn is a reliably great place to come to on Rose St.  Always busy, and with sharp service, the Mussel Inn has a good friendly feel to it, and the menu has a brilliant range of mussels by the kilo or half kilo, which you can team with a range of sauces. There are also lots of scallops options, as well as oysters and some really tasty starters to be had too.
5 The thing about mussels is that no matter where you get them from, they seem to taste the same every time, with the only real indicator of quality being the level of food poisoning / diarrhoea you find yourself with the following morning. Because of this, I rarely bother with them even though I find mussels incredibly tasty, but The Mussel Inn's lunchtime deal was just too good to resist on a recent visit.  To be controversial, I actually went for the chowder instead of the mussels, and found it to be utterly fantastic and full of fishy goodness. I wasn't in the mood for wine so just had a coke while E-Bot slugged back her glass of white, but with a big bowl of fries on the side as well, the £7.50 price was an absolute steal.
4 I had heard good things about this place before I managed to go to it. My best friend would come to Edinburgh regularly for the rugby and would rave about the mussels in this restaurant. So I checked it out!  The atmosphere is really laid back and really comfortable. It's the sort of place you don't need to get really dressed up for, go in wearing a hoody and fat-ants and you're just fine. You have to have mussels when you're here, they're really yummy!
4 It's pretty simple really,if you're in the city for a weekend or a couple of days its a must to go here. I had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated,but the turnover seems pretty quick,staff were all friendly and helpful. If you're in town just go !!
4 I would travel all the way to Edinburgh for their seafood pasta -- absolutely delicious....  Good service and actually pretty reasonable given the quality of food. Would return.
4 Wow!  Great mussels, super friendly staff. They were helpful with our 7 year old, letting us get a half portion of fish and chips, bringing crayons, and chatting with her.  We both got the lunch special, one with leeks and one with shallots.  Both were very tasty and fresh.  They come with steak fries and bread, and a glass of wine.  The salad that came with the fish was crisp and lovely.  If you could put these mussels with french-style bread and fries, it would be a perfect 5 stars.
4 Started with the mussels cooked in their natural juices.  These particular mussels came from the Shetland Islands.  They were fresh, tasty and similar to Penn Cove mussels at home.  Several separate broths are offered.    Next, I had scallops which had been farmed in the area.  Unlike the US, these were served with the corals.  These "Queen" scallops were very tasty though somewhat on the small side -- only a small bit per scallop.    Wines seemed to be reasonably priced and the restaurant was clean and bright.
5 I came here almost four years ago when I first visited Edinburgh. This time I went as I stopped by Edinburgh on my way up north, and they actually sat me at the same table. Such coincidence! I had fond memories of the mussels here, and they again did not disappoint. I got the lunch deal so a plate of mussels with salad and bread. I also ordered a seafood chowder. The chowder was quite watery, although the taste was lovely. The flavors were predominately from the fish in the soup, and I enjoyed it. The mussels (I got with shallots) were fresh and delicious, and I mopped up the left over sauce with the bread.
1 horrible food, even worse service.  my mussels were crunchy.  the sand had not been expelled properly.  no rhyme nor reason to how people are seated.  there are better mussels in edinburgh.  i don't understand what all the fuss is about with this place.  it is in a relatively fun area i suppose, but that's real estate, not restaurant.
5 Five years ago my wife, my 13 year old son and I stumbled upon this restaurant during the Edinburgh Festival and had a great time eating their mussels. We were impressed with their food and hospitality. Fast forward to this year and my wife and I are celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary in Edinburgh and we decide that our first stop will be the Mussel Inn Restaurant. The staff to celebrate our anniversary gave us a dessert trio on the house!! They are the best here, knowledgeable, kind and a great eating experience. We'll be back!
4 Pretty nice place for Mussels or sea food.  Great service and resonable prices.
4 Am I a student? Yes.  Do l like eating out? Yes.  Do I like good value for money? Yes.  Do I love fresh mussels? Yes!! Do I like Mussel Inn Restaurant? Definitely!   Good crusty bread (served warm), amazing prices. Could easily split a big pot of mussels between two (if you're good enough friends) for about a fiver each. Now I haven't tried any other dishes here besides the mussels, but I'm assuming they are pretty good.   Overall I really like this place. It doesn't get 5 stars because well, I can think of better Edinburgh based seafood places and well, the decor is a little lame! The service is okay, but the experience is good.   Like!
4 Delicious mussels! Good service, nice atmosphere. Good bread.  I had a wonderful time.   I guess it's a bit crowded and I'm not in love with the decor, but it's solid.
5 I had read a lot about this place and came to it with high expectations. I was not disappointed. My joy started when the smell of the delicious steamed mussels hit me as I walked in the door. It made me more hungry. I had the mussels steamed in white wine, shallots and cream. A half kilo was the perfect size (35 in all). A buddy had the Moroccan style and they were even better -- amazing how the flavor infused the mussels. great for dipping bread into.   Argula heavy house salad and a value priced Sauvignon Blanc rounded out the dinner. The starter of raw oysters was just ok -- not as good as the ones I get on the east coast of the USA. Still a great dinner experience. Would go back in a heart beat. It was the best dining experience we had in Edinburgh.
2 We had a very disappointing visit to the Mussel Inn. The soup that I had to start was extremely poor. The mussels were better, but it made us "kind of sad that I can no longer keep it in my mind as the holy grail of mussel places."   Overall, we said: "It's an extremely popular place, as was evidenced by the lively and diverse crowd packed in for a busy lunchtime service, but I was pretty underwhelmed by the quality, particularly of the soup."
5 Reluctantly tried mussels for the first time here two years ago and I've been coming here ever since! Total convert. The Dijon and Leek is by far the best flavour, but why stick to one!? Its so inexpensive my boyfriend and I usually order 3-4 half kilos to share. The other favorites are moroccan and blue cheese. But PLEASE PLEASE if you do go, order the crab salad it is heaven!
3 I've popped in a few times over the years, and while not blown away by anything they do, it's always been a safe bet for a decent lunch.  I nipped in for what's billed as a 'lunchtime quickie' today and have to say it wasn't too bad overall, given you get mussels, a small glass of wine, a bowl of chips and bread and butter for £7.50.  You do have to have your wits about you though, as the mussels that normally come in either kilo or half kilo sizes are reduced to a smaller bowl size for this deal option. You might be a bit disappointed with this if you're expecting the usual metal pot to arrive on your table.  That leaves me with my only minor gripe - the smell! There was a less than wholesome undertone in the air today that, had it been any stronger, would have had me squeezing the lemon wedge onto my top lip (in CSI pre-autopsy stylee) rather than into my bowl of mussels.  Hopefully just a bad day in the kitchen.
3 The Mussel Inn is a solid bet for a cheap lunch. I'm gluten free so the bread is off limits (but I remember from before eating about 3 baguettes worth with my mussels). They do tend to cram you in so probably not the best bet for a romantic meal but for a great cheap lunch with lovely fresh food, then its a good choice.  Mussels, chips and a glass of wine/beer/soft drink is £7.95. Non mussel eaters can have cullen skint. Mussels are fresh and well prepared, with lots of options of sauce. I like the white wine and shallot and it does tend to be my default choice. I did find that this visit, I had a lot of closed mussels in my portion which isn't ideal so only 3 stars for this visit but the rest of the family enjoyed their cullen skink.  I'm now as wowed as I was when I first discovered it in Glasgow (they were better at filling the bread basket then) but for a decent lunch in the centre of town, then it is worth a visit.
1 We came. We saw. We got food poisoning. Visited last week while on vacation. The food tasted excellent, we each ordered various dishes. I personally loved their blue cheese mussel recipe. For maximum enjoyment try pairing the mussels with a cold glass of water as you vomit them back up three hours later. 3/5 barfs.
3 I suppose it's time for one of those reviews where you just don't see what everyone else really loved. Ok here goes: First off I have nothing major-negative to say , ok that's done. I heard about this place and really wanted to try it so once I did I had high expectations. It was good food, I had the Moroccan mussels the big one, and it was tasty and very spicy which I liked. The broth was also good, not great but good. Over all it was a good meal , if not a little pricy for me. The menu is not to big not to small. Beer goes well with the mussel pot I think. You have the wine sauce they are cooked in, so another glass of wine kind of over does it. A beer compliments it very well I believe . So it's a good restaurant , kind service, fresh seafood. I give it a thumbs up, if your visiting or just love locally harvested mussels go here!
4 Maybe I'm just paranoid, but I get really, really nervous when I'm traveling and wind up eating in tourist central. In most cities, you really wind up with only two options: You're either paying through the nose for decent food or paying a smaller amount for nastiness.  I'm happy to say that Mussel Inn didn't veer too far in either direction; our mussels were nicely spiced, steamed and flavorful, with perfectly solid service and a kind front of house that found us a table on a very busy evening. And prices were far from unreasonable; not cheap but not nearly as horrifying as I expected. Made for a satisfying meal downtown.
5 No surprises what this place specialises in.  I love this restaurant. I always have a small chowder to start, then maybe some baked oysters. All of the varieties of mussels I've tried are tasty, I do like the white wine mussels above the rest though.  I've never tried their specials but they always sound delicious.
5 Vous êtes en visite à Edimbourg et vous souhaitez goûter de bonnes moules d'Ecosse ? Ne cherchez pas plus loin, le Mussel Inn est l'endroit parfait !   J'y ai mangé un nombre incalculable de fois en trois ans de vie à Edimbourg, voilà qui prouve à quel point ce qu'on y mange est bon. Les prix y sont très corrects et les moules délicieuses ! Pêchées le matin même, la provenance des moules est toujours indiquée. Je n'ai jamais pu résister au kilo de moules accompagné de son bol de frites. Plusieurs sauces sont proposés et toutes sont vraiment délicieuses. Coup de coeur pour la sauce aux poireaux !   Si vous n'aimez pas les moules, rassurez-vous, d'autres fruits de mer sont proposés.  Le restaurant est très petit et est toujours bondé, pensez à réserver !
5 I was totally blown away by the food.  Extremely creative and fresh food, wonderful service, and a sinful ice cream-espresso-whisky affogato.
5 went here for new years eve and it was great - busy but in a good way, bustling and fun, had the mussels - of course and they were delicious, the food was great. great bread, all of the food was good. the inside is a bit like a cafe style rather than posh restaurant but that's what gives it it's character. loved it and would def go back again every year!
