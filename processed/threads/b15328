5 If anyone is looking for a ultimate real estate agent, get hold of Matt Faraoni of zip realty. He is totally awesome. He took me to around 150+ homes to look at. He never quit looking for a house for us. He is a very dedicated agent and if your dream house is out there, he WILL FIND IT. I can not say enough good things about this young man. When we finally found our home, it just so happened to be a short sale. If anyone know about a short sale, it is not an easy process to go through. triple the work for the agent but he never complained, He always had a positive attitude. Well long story short, we are in our home and we are very happy. SO, IF ANYONE OUT THERE IS LOOKING FOR THE ULTIMATE REAL ESTATE AGENT, GET HOLD OF                                                    MATT FARAONI OF ZIP REALTY   THANK YOU SO MUCH MATT FOR EVERYTHING YOU DID FOR US.

5 We contacted Kirk Conrado from one of the automatic notification services from Zip Realty. We didn't know anyone in the valley and he was FANTASTIC! We were out of state and would fly in often to see properties and he always made time for us. When we did find the house we wanted it was going through lis pendens and a real mess. He recommended and awesome attorney and we came out with a wonderful house, great deal, and someone we consider extended family - thanks, Kirk!  Kirk maintains the highest integrity of any realtor I know. He is fun, easy going, yet steadfastly aggressive and maintains and extremely professional attitude in all negotiations. Even though the seller's realtors were the nastiest we've ever dealt with, he rose above it all and maintained integrity and professionalism throughout each interaction.  If you don't know anyone in the valley, he's your person. We looked in Tempe, Chandler, Scottsdale, Phoenix, and Paradise Valley and he was familiar with each area. As we're really picky when it comes to both homes and the people we interact with, we appreciate his positive attitude, flexibility and friendly, yet persistent business acumen.
3 I've been keeping an eye on real estate in a certain neighborhood of Phoenix for a couple of years. Zip Realty's email service is fantastic for reviewing listings as they appear on MLS. I've been assigned to two gentlemen who were courteous and very service-oriented. They checked in with me, but weren't pushy since we let them know that we weren't ready to purchase yet.  Unfortunately, recently, my account was suddenly turned over to Jean Palumbo. She didn't introduce herself as my new realtor and she never told me why Tim is no longer responding to my emails. She was pushy and started spamming me with her emails.   In one email, she pitched me and didn't include a way to unsubscribe to her emails. I replied and reminded her that she needed to allow an unsubscribe when sending to a group - and she replied, arguing with me, saying that since she wrote the email, it didn't require an unsubscribe. Huh?  Geez. I couldn't wait to get out of there.  I finally inactivated my account today. Sorry I had to leave like this.
