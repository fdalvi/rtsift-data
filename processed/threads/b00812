5 When you leave the dentist's office with a smile on your face, you know you've found the right one! I had a filling fall out, which took part of my tooth.  I was also due for a cleaning and X-rays.   The appointment was set for 2 hours (first visit, always 2 hours) and I was out in just over that. The hygienist, Carrie, was awesome!  She cracked a few jokes and didn't ask my too many questions while her fingers were in my mouth. Than came Rachel with my X-rays.  She warned me it might be painful, but it wasn't.  I can't believe the technology they have here! Dr Schneider had an awesome sense of humor and handled mine really well.  He was upfront about what it would take to repair my tooth.  Crown or implant.   They are going to send the diagnosis for pre-approval to my insurance company first.  I'll know in 2 to 3 weeks.   I actually enjoyed myself here.  Beat sitting at work!
5 Yaaay! I got a new tooth! I broke my tooth clear in half when I was younger by opening a car door into my face...then broke it again a few years later on a sugar daddy. God knows what happened this time, but my front tooth was chipped and I was looking like a member of the Cletus clan. Dr. Schneider explained everything he was doing right before doing it and was an absolute perfectionist. He got the shade to match dead on and also shaped my "new tooth" to look just like all the others. It was my first time at this dentist and I will definitely use them again! The space is modern and clean, the staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable. My tooth and I thank you Dr. S!
5 Dr, Schneider is so personable. I loved how honest he was about my treatment. I had a filling and will need a new crown soon. I will definitely be  going back to him. The staff is very friendly as well!!
