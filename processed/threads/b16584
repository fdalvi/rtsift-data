5 I've been bringing my automobiles to these guys for three years now. They've never failed to address all my problems. They are friendly to women and don't take advantage. There work is dependable and their prices are unbeatable. If there is a problem with a part they will physically show you the issue and explain how they will fix it. You will not find better mechanics in Las Vegas or Henderson! Totally trustworthy. Thanks Dynamic Auto!
1 Biggest liars/crooks in this city. Went to them for about a year, and odd things  raised my suspicions: car being worked on at the furthest bay station away from office, window not working after coolant being worked on, broken seat after timing belt worked on, etc....Final straw was for a $250 coolant hose that after 'installation' looked dirty, used, like it was never replaced. That was three years ago and I stopped going. Two days ago I am driving down the street and my car LITERALLY died in the middle of the street. Had it towed to the dealership. Told it was timing belt, five hours' labor and water pump. $1600. I said "Wait a minute" & showed them my receipt from having 'done' all this at Dynamic Auto less than 3 years ago for $1000. Dealership showed me my timing belt, still attached in car, never has been replaced. Old, old, old. When I looked at my receipt, in tiny letters "good faith estimate only" as if it wasn't really a completed and paid for service. Looked at my other receipts from Dynamic Auto and they all have that at the top..... So, it looks like it was just an estimate not a receipt. Pretty good scam going on.
