5 I have had a couple repairs done there. They were quick and kept me updated in the process. Most importantly the car looks great. I would recommend them everyone.
2 wow.  Daughter's car get's smashed.  Insurance forces us to take it here.  First report - we'll have the car back to you in a week.  A week later, it will be ready in a week.  A week later, "It's going into the body shop".  Another week.  Initial estimate was 30 days out, so I guess it was ok that we got the car before the "system date", however, I cannot imagine what took so long.    Three weeks, waiting in the lobby for 40 minutes after we were told it was ready.  They did do a nice job on fixing the damage, you cannot tell it was ever harmed.  Don't count on their time estimates though.
5 I had great service here! I give this place a five star.  They had messed up on my appointment, I was not on the books at all..yet, they took me in and took care of me, It was 8 o'clock and I had to be at work by 930, and she said she'll get me out of here by 9.  I don't know what she did, got papers, got on her phone.. next thing you know I have my rental car ready, my car was in the shop and ready to get fix :)) it was lovely.
