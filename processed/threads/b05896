4 I bought my set of tires from discount tire on fort apache a year ago. I recently moved to the sunrise manor area and this store happes to be the nearest discount tire store that I can go to. So I decided to pop in one afternoon to get my tires rotated. Julian helps me through the whole process, the whole staff made it like its a very important job. Balancing the tires, rotating, adjust the air pressure, the whole nine yards for free.   They did a wonderful job and I am glad I choose discount tire for my baby beemer. Thanks a lot discount tire.
