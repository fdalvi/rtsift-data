5 Awesome place to find unique, antique, seasonal, or homemade gift items! Highly reccomend!
5 This is such a fun store to shop in.  I can spend a lot of time just looking around and every time I go, I find great buys.  Anything from home decor to antiques and a bit of country, shabby chick and some great hand made crafts.  Something for everyone in this store!  I tell everyone about Tillie's Attic as I just found it about a year ago.  Wish I would have known about it sooner.  Just love it!!
