2 This was our first meal together when we moved here little bit over a year ago. Yes! We ordered pizza! I have always liked Pizza Hut, but this was a bad experience! Pizza was just plain, not much flavor? And we had to pay for it that evening to the next day!!! Wife refuses to order from there again. And I have no problem with that.
3 OK, finally tried them again! Over a year later, since wife was cooking our thanksgiving dinner. Yes, it's an early dinner since her and daughter had to work on thanksgiving!! I didn't feel like to shell out 70-80 dollars at a sports bar! I order two pizzas and wings. Pizza was much better, and the wings were good to. will have to try again, to see if they make our good list again!!
1 Pizza Hut cheese LOVERS is Capital NASTY. Don't order it unless you want something nasty.
1 Food poison. My husband was sick after eating the wings. They were under cooked. Pizza Hut admitted this and sent a $60 gift card to our home. Do not order wings from here.
