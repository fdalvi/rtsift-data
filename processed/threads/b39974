5 This place is rad, I work near here and decided to drop by and I am so glad I did. The staff is super nice and the place is well organized every time i've gone in. Even during one of their blow out sales it was still easy to find things. If you have a little girl you'll have more of a selection and they have a really good amount of carriers and wraps. If you dont have a fussy child around you can literally lose an hour in this place, its rad!
5 This is by far the best Kid to Kid location I have been to! It's well organized and has great selection.  And their staff is fantastic - always super friendly and helpful. Even during their big Fill a Bag sale event, the staff took time to make sure shoppers were taken care of and the cashiers made us feel welcome. It was an excellent shopping experience! Can't wait to go back!
