4 A fine little music venue, though word has it that it's closed now. The guy who books and promotes for the place is real super cool, the bar has a decnt beer selection, the live sound is great, and the stage is pretty cool too.  Oh, and you can gamble on poker machines and whatnot if you wish.  Sorta off the beaten path, but good place to see a show.  UPDATE:  It's closed.  :(

4 Wow! The inside is so beautiful, the staff is so friendly, got my ice cold beer promptly and the gaming machines were HOTT, people were winning left and right! Definitely my new favorite bar on the north side!
