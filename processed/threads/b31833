3 If action figures are your thing you will absolutely LOVE this place. There are action figures for every sci-fi, nerdly thing you can imagine. I say nerdly very lovingly :)  They did have a few other things like Stargate costumes etc. I would have absolutely LOVED to see more like this. I feel they have the potential to be so much more than just action figures.  The video game exhibit was extremely disappointing but we were told that one of the major donors pulled out at the last minute.  All in all if you are in the area and looking for something cool to check out, certainly give this place a stop by.
4 Comic books, action figures, original artwork, AND a museum with a whole bunch of figures.  Really great fun :)
4 The Pop Culture Experience was fun for me. If I had to categorize this place, I think I'd call it an action figure museum more than anything else.  The price for entering the museum was very cheap (just a few bucks). When I was there I was shocked at the amount of toys I saw. The only reason I don't give this place five stars is because they had almost no Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in their museum when I went to see it (hint, hint). The entry of the Museum has some action figures for sale and a rather decent selection of current age comics and packs. The only downfall i see to this place is that once you've paid to go in once, the hype is over. The replay value of the museum is limited as it does not have very good advertised changes for its exhibits.
5 $5 for a trip down memory lane.  Good deal!
