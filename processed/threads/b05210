5 Dr. Insera is great.  He never pushes you to come in too often when it is not needed.  He has told me that I did have a case of the "too longs"  though, which was true.  I go every 2 weeks and that does the trick.    See him, you'll thank him.
5 Dr. Insera is awesome. I'm glad that I went here. He makes you fell at home. They staff is very friendly and helpful
5 Dr. Insera is great and personable!!  For years I had lower back/hip pain.  I had gone to another chiropractor years ago and something didn't feel right on the last visit so I never went back.  From the previous Yelp reviews I thought I would try Ideal Chiropractic.  Dr. Insera had me move this way and that.  From that he determined that my hip was out of place.  He was able to put it back into place.  Amazing! I could actually touch my toes after wards! I now feel much better now and rarely need to go back.  He doesn't make you come back unless you really need or feel too!  Check him out!  I would make an appointment though he does stay pretty busy!
5 Completely agree with the positive reviews. Dr Insera is very personable and does a super job as a chiropractor. Takes the time to completely check out your body for issues. As a runner, he also understands my post run/race needs. Highly recommended and I've been through a bunch of them!
5 Shaun is the Dr. that I have been seeing at this practice and without a doubt, he is the BEST Chiropractor I have ever been to (and, I have seen quite a few). He takes his time and evaluates your situation on EACH visit.  I often refer to my visits as a "religious experience" and I look forward to my appointments because I feel absolutely awesome when I leave this place. I don't have any issues that are causing me problems....I just believe in keeping your body in balance and this seems to do the trick for me!!!!
