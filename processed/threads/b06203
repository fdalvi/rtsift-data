5 I LOVE Quiznos, a lot better than some other fast food sandwich places. I think the bread quality is better here and the ingredients are fresher. It just seems so much more convenient to me to order the sandwich from the menu and they prepare it for me. Then I add the extra jalapeno peppers and peppercinis. Also I'm a big fan of their honey mustard sauce.
1 Small skinny sandwiches with high price-tried it once never again.  And openning up across from subway wasn't to smart.
5 I'm a big fan of quiznos and always get the same thing every single time... regular size classic club, medium pop, and a cookie :) I love the fact that you can watch them make your food, and they're fast, attentive and nice! I also liked the fact that they had tables and chairs outside, so i didn't have to leave my dog in the truck and she got to come sit outside with us. Too bad this quiznos is far from our house, but if it was closer I'd come here more often...
3 The food is the same as any other Quizno's but this location took forever because there was only 1 employee working when I went...seemed like it took 10-15 min to make my 2 sandwiches and get my transaction closed out. I couldn't imagine how long it would've taken had there been a line! Haven't been to Quizno's in a while but it seems like prices went up....don't remember a sandwich being 8 or 9 bucks!
5 The food is always good.  The service and restaurant is clean too.  Its hard to pick my favorite sandwich .  Prices are reasonable
2 I went here a while back and I forget what kind of sandwich I ordered but the guy put my meat in what looked like dirty dish water before whisking it away for whatever was the next step. I never went back.
