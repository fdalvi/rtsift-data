3 I REALLY wanted to LOVE this place but I really can't give it more than 3.5 stars, and that's being generous. The chicken was Ã¼ber tender but not very flavorful or crispy. I was excited to try the famed Cane sauce, but my eight year old described it best when she said: "it's like it wants to be In-N-Out spread, but it can't." Basically it's just a really sweet mayo based dip - I switched to my homemade sriracha mayo halfway through the meal. The coleslaw was my highlight and the lemonade was my husband's. Personally I think the lemonade was too sweet and lacking on the lemons - probably just needs a minor adjustment as it is supposedly fresh squeezed. The fries were crinkle cut, grade school style, and nothing special. In fact they were slightly soggy from their styrofoamed journey home. The Texas toast was tasty, but once again - just bland. It's just a thick piece of sweet white bread with sesame seeds (tastes almost like Hawaiian bread) that's been buttered and toasted - it was good but I wish my piece has been toasted on both sides. Overall, not terribly bad. I'm glad I tried it and I'll probably be back - but next time I'd opt to dine in just to see if there is a difference.
3 This place came very highly recommended from several people.  My husband works in the area and was anxiously awaiting it's grand opening.  He found out the history of the place and the owner, and so we decided it was a place we'd go.  We finally made it there yesterday.  The place was clean and the people were friendly.    The menu is small, but I like that.  Too many options overwhelm me.  Hubby and I both ordered the meal that came with 4 chicken strips, fries, toast and coleslaw.  Our kids got the kids meal.    We paid nearly $28. This is more than I had expected, and more than I'd care to pay in the future.  For fast food, this is outrageous.    The chicken was good.  Not too flavorful, but the breading was perfect, not too much.  The fries were soggy and under done.  I could do better at home in my home fryer.  The toast was, well, toast.  Nothing special there.  And the coleslaw was same as store bought, I'd had better.  The "famed" Cane Sauce was ok.  It didn't blow my mind and it wasn't gross.  Ketchup was available, which was good since my kids thought the Cane sauce was "weird".  Ranch would have been more their taste.  We may go back if there is a location that pops up closer to where we live, and if we were kid-less for the meal.  It's too expensive otherwise.
4 I would describe Raising Cane's as the chicken version of In-N-Out because they only sell one thing and that's chicken strips.  The restaurant is decorated with Movie memorabilia. It's kind of odd considering it has nothing to do with the food but I liked it. The employees genuinely seem happy to be there and are extremely helpful.  My boyfriend and I both ordered the chicken finger sandwich with fries and a drink. The fries were great and I enjoyed my chicken sandwich. I don't know how to describe the taste of their house sauce but I like it a lot. I used it on my fries and my sandwich.   I had a good experience here. I think they need to jazz up the menu with more sauces and offer additional side items. I'll be back when I have a random craving for tasty chicken fingers!
3 On the one hand, I don't think this place deserves the 2.5 star rating it currently holds but on the other, I can understand the disappointment..  We got the Box combo which is like 4 tenders, Texas toast, cole slaw, fries and drink.  I welcome this new kind of fast food restaurant in my neighborhood!  Its nice that you can get this kind of combo vs the traditional burger, fry, drink thing.  The prices are a tiny bit hefty - its just shy of Chipotle prices, I got this combo for roughly the price of a burrito.    That said, the tenders were pretty good!  Not overly breaded, fried right and not too greasy.  Not a huge fan of the Cane sauce - its not terrible but very negligible.  However, I do believe if you run a restaurant selling pretty much nothing but chicken tenders, you HAVE to offer more of a variety of sauces.  McDonald's offers 2 things - nuggets and tenders which comprise of what, 10% of the menu?  And they have like 10 sauces!  Anyway, more sauce options please!  The toast and the fries were slightly less done than I prefer.  The coleslaw was ok - not too exciting.  The service was GREAT, staff are pretty friendly - of course there were only 4 customers..  The atmosphere is fun and modern - random posters and pictures on the walls.  All in all, I'd like to see more sauces and a deeper fryer bath but I probably will get some more.  :)
2 2.5 stars  The short: Open and clean setup with friendly staff, but it's basically just-ok carby kid food.  The long: On the south side of Thomas, just west of 44th St., turning left into the lot can be a bear during peak traffic, but it's otherwise fairly accessible for people driving in from the west or walking up, like I did. The inside is wide open and clean with plenty of chairs and tables that were just a little too cluttered around the restaurant floor plan. Otherwise, it doesn't stick out much from other fast food joints. I went during the middle of a somewhat busy lunch period, and who seemed to be the head cashier loudly greeted just about everyone who walked in the front door on the other side of the restaurant. My cashier was friendly and quick, though he seemed a tiny bit frazzled by the small rush.   I ordered The Box combo and a lemonade to go and headed back to my office a short 5-minute walk away. I hoped the freshly squeeze lemonade would be awesome, even if they did charge only about a dime more than fountain drinks for a regular. Although I could taste the lemon, the drink was so sweet, it may as well have been from a mix or carton. The Box comes with a small container of sweet coleslaw dressed in a lot of mayo, a slab of soft-in-the-inside, perfectly browned-on-the-outside toast, somewhat slightly crisp, thin crinkle cut fries, a container of Cane sauce (which tastes like burger sauce), and, of course, four chicken strips. Unless you're me and you get only three chicken strips . . . or two smallish chicken strips and one big chicken strip that maybe they counted as two, but really, halfway through the meal, you're so carbed-out full that you don't miss anything aside from the extra dollar you paid for that extra chicken strip. The strips were fine. It was real chicken, and true to advertising, it was fresh. Sort of crispy, but not as crispy as I'd hoped, or even expected. Tender and moist enough to not be bad. But not special. All of it was pretty one-note. I can't even tell you what part of the meal I liked best . . . maybe the toast. Coincidentally, every time I took a bite of that toast, I'd think, "This is the most random slice of toast ever. What's it even doing here?"   So, it's fine if you're like me and want to try every new eatery that opens near my home or office and appreciate the novelty of places like this, but personally, I won't be making a return visit.  Edit: I almost threw my drink cup away before I noticed the giveaway pull tab on it--I won a free slice os Texas toast! How do you like them apples? =)
4 My first trip here, very clean and I love the aluminum chairs! The food was hot and fresh and I love their special sauce too. TOAST!
2 First visit to a Raising Canes..Mixed review here.  On the good side--chicken was fresh, juicy, hot, and flavorful. Fries were fresh from the fryer..  On the not so good side--Fries were the "old school" crinkle cut, processed fries you used to get 20+ years ago..Texas toast served with the meal was lightly toasted on one side only, and was not the least bit warm. Sauce served with fingers was a very "different" flavor than the norm.. The cashier described it as a mix of ranch and honey mustard.. I didnt get any sweet or mustard out of it. More like a chilipowder ranch??? I would prefer a country gravy, a real honey mustard, or sweet and sour and/or bbq.  But the worst part, IMHO, was the little cup of coleslaw.. Totally devoid of flavor. It was like they mixed cabbage with watery mayonnaise.   My "box combo" was 4 smallish fingers, some fries, the little cup of coleslaw,and a small soda..It was $7.00 with tax. I would've been ok with the price if the slaw had been decent, the toast had been toasted and warm, and if they had better/more choices for sauce. But at this price, I was disappointed with what I got.
2 Maybe it's the 10 year old boy still in me but I LOVE chicken fingers! The thought of a restaurant dedicated solely to chicken fingers lead me to believe they MUST have perfected the art of amazing chicken fingers?  So I thought.  Went to the counter and was really surprised how small the menu is- it's tenders and a few sides, that's it!! Order the 3-tender basket which includes fries and some toast or bread. Asked for ranch STOP we only have our Cane Sauce. BUT I want ranch I exclaimed! We only have our Cane Sauce. and so on... Got my drink, by the time my drink was filled the guy from the counter was behind me with my basket in hand before I could even find a seat.   Fingers - so the chicken fingers themselves were breaded, moist and tender, not greasy at all, however I felt they could be a little more crisp... They were much smaller than the ones in the picture at the store and web site.  Fries - I don't normally eat fries. Don't get me wrong I like fries, I just avoid the carbs so If they were really good I would have eaten them. These were SOGGY, old-school crinkle cut fries!! The place sells chicken fingers and fries. WHY NOT MAKE AMAZING HOMEMADE FRIES? Why not do what the belgians do - cut 'em fresh, fry 'em TWICE (two different temperatures) and make them amazing? These were SOGGY. I would rather eat fries from Wendy's or even McDonalds.  Decore - Very nicely laid out, modern looking store. They spent some money on the place, it's evident.   BOTTOM LINE: If you are going to be a specialty store, you had better ROCK the few menu items you make. It'l be interesting if you are around in a few years.
2 My family and I went here last night because my daughter wanted "chicky" and we were driving down Thomas so decided to give it a try.  Definetly NOT a place we will be dying to come back to.  They don't have any options other than how many pieces you want.  There are no flavor options for the chicken, they just come in plain flavor.  The texas toast they served wasn't very toasty at all and the fries were cold and un-seasoned.  Service was fast & friendly - 1 star.  The chicken tasted pretty darn good - another star.
4 Not bad, the decor of the place is great; it looks clean, new and contemporary... I didn't really understand why there's a disco ball in the lobby but what the hell.  It's one of the best fast food chicken fingers intown, the meat was very tender. Fries are good, sause was great, cole slaw was good; however, it's been 30 minutes since my meal and my body feels like it's overdosing on cholesterol...   I'll be back if I don't suddenly die right now.
5 I just moved here from Las Vegas and though Phoenix basically has everything anyone could ever want, they didn't have Rasing Canes and I ate at my location back in Vegas every week for like three months before I moved preping myself to be without it. Well go figure they open a location just three miles from my new apartment the month I move to Phoenix! I feel so warm and fuzzy inside!  I love this place because the chicken is always super fresh, the fries pair perfectly with it and the big texas toast with "The Box" is just right. The caniac sause goes with everything on the plate and I usually need extra! I'm not sure why people ar bitchin so much about this place though, it's basically the In N' Out for chicken, they serve one thing and they do it well. I can never get enough of this place and I highly recomend it to anyone! They always have the best, most fun and friendly service and I just love the pellet ice, I sware it makes the drink taste so much better.   Try it for yourself  Phoenix, but try it with an open mind. Go inside, play along with the servers, enjoy the local flare hanging on the walls and read about the namesake dog Cane one and two. I love this place and I hope you can see why too!
3 Finally got around to checking out this place.  The building is new and modernized, placed on a large lot that was once a burger king.  While there is ample parking, it is located along a very busy stretch of Thomas road which makes it a bit of a challenge to get into.  My student-driver daughter ended up pulling practically around the block to get in here.  An experienced driver would still have difficulty.  Once inside, the dining-room is open and airy, with an industrial modern appearance.  Everything was clean and shiny.  We decided to order the "Caniac" ($8.69) so we could both share.  This meal comes with six crispy chicken tenders, two containers of "cane sauce", a small cup of cole slaw, Texas Toast, a huge heap of Crinkle-cut fries, and a large drink .    It took about 5 minutes to get our order, I guess because they make it fresh to order.  At least the chicken part - which was the best part of the meal.  While waiting, I wandered over to the drink bar which has the usual carbonated-sugar drinks and both sweetened and unsweetened tea.  I chose the unsweetened iced tea which was fresh, but weak, almost overpowered by the tap-water taste.  Three suggestions here - filter your water, brew your tea stronger and provide lemon slices/quarters to go with it.  Especially this time of year when you practically cannot give away lemons (at least in my neighborhood).    Eventually, our food arrived, packed in your typical square , partitioned styro.  As I said the chicken was the best part of the meal, but that is relative.  the cole slaw was uninspiring, just like any cole slaw served at another well-known fast-food chicken place.  Not bad, but not different.  The Crinkle-cut fries could be so much better if they were fried fresh and crispy, instead, ours were cooked appropriately, not very salty at all,  yet limp , indicating they've been sitting around a while.  The cane sauce is their special recipe, but it too didn't elicit any feelings of "I gotta get me some of that".  The Texas Toast is something I wonder about.  To me it tasted stale, but that may have been simply the artifical sweetener in the bread recipe.  I think that it is somewhat superfluous to the meal, more or less just a filler.  If you are going to do something like this, you gotta make sure the bread has some flavor or crispness to compliment the dish or you are simply providing filler for the waste can.  Finally, the chicken.  It was juicy, tender and the pieces were large enough to be substantial.  The coating was crispy but lacked much discernable flavor, beyond the browned taste of coating.  I think it would have benefitted from a bit more seasoning, at least some salt.  Considering that this is fast food, it wasn't bad overall, but I'm not sure I'll be returning anytime soon.
4 I liked this place so much I went two days in a row... :)  The staff was definitely friendly both visits. Saturday morning it was a little slower, but that just meant that I got extra attention from the staff.   The chicken was outstanding! And loved the Texas Toast that came with my order.   Welcome addition to our neighborhood. (I'm pretty sure my hubby goes through their Drive-Thru often.)
5 I just recently moved to Arizona and was ecstatic when I found out that Raising Canes had just recently opened up here! I used to live in Louisiana where this place originated and I would eat there probably 3 times a week, I am addicted to it. I read some of the other reviews complaining about how there is no variety and in my opinion that is what makes this place so great. I love chicken tenders, and they make the best. If I want to eat chicken tenders I'm going to Cane's. I find that because they only make chicken fingers they actually make a better quality more consistent meal (don't forget that we are still talking about a fast food restaurant). The lemonade is my favorite amongst any other food chain and I can't get enough of their Texas toast and signature sauce.    If you don't want chicken fingers don't go to Raising Cane's, if you are in the mood for some awesome Chicken fingers and lemonade then this is your place.
3 I went to Raising Canes for lunch.  Canes took over an old Burger King and spruced it up such it didn't look like an old Burger King.  That's a heck of a lot better than your basic 'berto's makeover.    The menu is limited; chicken strips, fries, coleslaw and Texas toast.   I had the 4-strip chicken box.  The chicken strips were freshly cooked and better than average, although I wish they had a bit more spice in the marinade or the breading.  The fries were crinkle cut, and were delivered warm and crispy.  The coleslaw was ... meh.  The Cane dipping sauce did enhance the taste of the chicken strips.  Overall the food was as good as what I would expect at a Church's or a KFC.  What was better the the competition was the look and cleanliness of the restaurant.  That is what I see as reason to go to Canes.  The table did not have the greasy fell you can have at other deep fry palaces.  I'll likely be back, but not for the food.  I'll be back for the item of the meal I have not discussed; the soda fountain ice.  The ice is finely crushed, almost to a slushy texture, which makes it great for sipping and chewing.  So rare to find top notch crushed ice these days, you know.
4 Oh YUM.  Fantastic chicken strip shop!  Honey Mustard dressing is delish, Texas Toast is delish too!  The lemonade is wonderful!  Cane sauce just eh, fries are nothing new, cole slaw is bleh.  Who comes here for fries or cole slaw anyway, it's about the CHICKEN!  These strips surpass anything I've had before, they are wonderful.
4 Chicken fingers are such a basic concept, but the type of breading makes all the difference.  The fingers here are plump and juicy and the breading is actually light and crunchy, while I wouldn't call them my favorite chicken finger I have ever eaten, I would say they are my favorite fast food chicken finger.  They are much better than KFC or Jack in the Box, and there is something about the simplicity of the menu that I really like.  I love that they have crinkle fries, which in my opinion or the best fry you can get and the Cane's sauce is addictive!  It is cool, creamy with a punch of flavor, and I dip chicken and fries in it equally.  When I get "The Box" I always sub an extra sauce for the coleslaw, which I could care less about but it isn't bad.  The Texas toast is a somewhat odd addition, but no carb lover should turn their nose up at it!  Probably my most favorite thing at Raising Cane's is the lemonade...it is the BEST lemonade I have ever had, much better than Chic-Fil-A's which I sometimes think is sour.  Sometimes chicken strips just sound good, and Raising Cane's satisfies, so give it a try!
5 Surprised so many are quick to discount a place that you can get a full meal for $6. Yes your chicken wasn't handed to you by a hipster in a barn that was upgraded with modern lighting and a DJ playing, but for what you pay for, Canes is awesome. If you want fried chicken fingers these have to be some of the best.   To clarify for some of the others, a burger king used to be here and they welcomingly bulldozed down that atrocity to burgers to the ground. And they do have modern lighting, and a disco ball for some reason, if that is what you're into.
3 I checked out this place from a billboard I saw on the freeway. I'm a sucker for chicken strips, so had to check them out. When you walk in, it's a great industrial/ modern feel. They have pop culture posters & signs hanging everywhere. The menu is pretty simple, chix strips, slaw, fries and garlic toast, the options range in the amt of chix strips you want. I went with what they call The Box, I chose the lemonade, it looked fresh and was delicious. I enjoyed the chix strips, they were not greasy and actually had a good amount of chicken. The fries were the ole fashioned Ore Ida kind from when I was a kid. The slaw was ok and the garlic toast was great. The dipping sauce was average, I thought it was lacking a kick. All in all I would frequent Raisin Cane's again.
3 Not in the running as far as being the best chicken fanger in town.    Fairly decent serving sizes, but when you specialize in Fangers, your Fangers better be AWESOME !!  These can be "very good" when fresh out of the fryer, but they are not AWESOME !!  Coleslaw was completely pedestrian and bland.  (Rock-n-Roll Fingers in Tempe does a far better job at making and selling the kind of chicken fangers that Raising Cane's oughta strive for.)  I'm giving these guys one extra star because AWESOME fangers are hard to find in the fast food realm, and these are above average for sure.
4 Everything about this place is goood!! The food is perfect, not greasy. The spicey dipping sauce is flavorful & goes great with the chicken fingers & the fries... Plus the service was speedy, and the place is shiny and new! Loved it :-)
2 Plain Jane Cane's!  I don't think I've ever had such a bland, uninteresting meal. The simple menu could do with something to compliment the otherwise good (not excellent) chicken strips. The signature sauce is simply gross. Yes I have mixed ketchup, mustard and mayo as well, but trying to dress it up with a sort of Mrs. Dash type seasoning, completely failed. Really? A couple of other dipping sauces are going to eat up the profits? The Texas toast was a nice addition, but there ain't a place on planet earth that doesn't at least serve a 3-cent honey packet. Maybe the goal is to be as boring and middle-of-the road as possible. Having said that, the staff was great!
2 It was okay. I compare it to a place back home called Zaxby's. The girl suggested that I order the box so that i could taste all that they had. The tenders were normal tenders, the secret sauce helped them out. The coleslaw was not good. The fries were gross. The best part of the meal was the toast and lemonade.
4 Not bad, but not great.  Just standard chicken strips.  The service, however, was the best service I have had a a fast food establishment.  The staff was wonderful.  I would choose Cane's over another establishment because of the staff.
3 The chicken fingers are good and juicy but they're not the best I've ever tasted. I wasn't that impressed by the dipping sauce or the fries, but I loved the Texas toast.
4 Food is good, I am from the southern east coast and was looking for food I am used to having back home. I thought this would be like Zaxby's and I was right it sure is similar.   Only downfall to here is that they only offer the Canes Sauce, which is a Cajun based sauce and I am not big on Cajun, they should add some more sauces and then it would be perfect!
4 Very glad Cane's made their way to Arizona...it was one thing I missed about living in Las Vegas! It's not close to home, but always worth the drive for fresh, hot and delicious food and great service. The staff is friendly, the restaurant is clean and it is cheap comfort food.
2 I never wanted to find myself on Thomas Rd. saying "I'd like 3 fingers", but that's how my night at Cane's began.... Over all, I can say my 3 finger experience wasn't as fulfilling as I'd hoped.  For being a place that "specializes" in chicken, I wasn't impressed. The special sauce was alright. They give you a piece of toast with your meal. Overall it just seemed greasy - not my style. I'd rather go get some chicken from Safeway.
4 I had been told how amazing the food was, so I think I was slightly disappointed. However, it WAS good, just not life changing...but the thing that set this place apart was the service! I felt like I was in a sit-down restaurant. The cashier was very nice and personable, came to check on us, and it was extremely clean and well-decorated. It did not feel like a fast food joint.
2 Uninspiring. Good location though, right down the street from the game stop where I took my son before coming here and surprise surprise half the people I saw at the game stop were here which allowed me to further cement my point. See, if all you do is eat crap and play video games all day you will end up like all the fat losers in this place. Menu was extremely limited. Better like canes sauce or ketchup because those are your choices. The Cole slaw was sloppy and smelled and tasted like it was made with elmers glue. The chicken was freshly cooked though....
3 Nothing crazy out of the ordinary here. You get some chicken strips that taste like any other chicken strip you can get anywhere (not worse nor better). The fries are crinkle fries, kind of like the ones you get at del taco (i like del taco's better actually). I liked the cajun dipping sauce that came with them it was almost like a cajun ranch, the bread was also really good. As first timers we asked the clerk about what she would recommend and she was amazingly nice. She was patient and helpful in our decision, she also had a big smile on the whole time. Just because I wasn't wowed by this establishment (i like chik-fil-a better), I probably won't be returning but if it's the only thing around I wouldn't discourage it.
5 omg nom nom nom !
3 Service was GREAT, texas toast is awsome...the chicken was good but lacked seasoning and the sauce is not very good. Quality and service is good, they just need a little better chicken. I hope they adjust it and it will be FANTASTIC!
1 "Lowering Cane's expectations" should be the name.  They have just set the bar low on food quality and taste.  No seasoning at all in the breading of the chicken fingers and the fries seem like they came straight from your grocer's freezer.  Must not have thought much of their dog if this is their tribute to him.  Just drove away disappointed.  Want my junk food to taste good if I'm going to splurge with this type of caloric intake.  Only positive was stellar Drive-Thru service and the place seemed pretty clean.  Don't waste your time.
4 I am not usually a fan of fast food, but I will give Raising Cane's a pretty solid score.  It is very clean inside and very attentative service.  A very limited menu offering but solid food.  The chicken is moist and succulent and the fries are the typical frozen fries.  You do have to wait a few minutes for your food though.  They are cooking it a la minute (to order).  I am pleased with these guys so I will go back!
5 This is for the new store in Tempe.  we have been eating at the Phx. store but very happy new the store in Tempe is open.  One of the employees in Nevada told us about the new store opening and it was great to see her her in TEMPE TRAINING THE NEW STAFF.   NATALIE from Vegas is just great.  The service is excellent and the food is consistent from store to store and very happy with that.  Management and staff at all locations come by on a regular basics and check if everything is ok or do we need anything.  Great Service for a fast food operation.  Keep up the good work, great food...

4 The food was fresh, the place was clean, a great place for lunch or a snack.
1 bland and overpriced.  For a place that specializes in strips, you'd think they would be better than KFC.....they are not.
4 Went back and chicken was better...still a little room for improvement but I did bump it up to 4 stars
5 Hot chix!!!! Living in the south for a quater of a century I must admit, I was a little bumed leaving some of that style food behind. Moving back home to the west is awesome and then....wooHoo! Bonus Big Score! Raisin Canes....A bit of the deep south, right'cheer N da desert!!!! If you've never eaten southern fried yard bird, check'EM out! The sauce is Bombdigity!
1 Ok if you are a little kid and like chicken nuggets. Nothing I would EVER return for. Blan
5 I give this place 5 stars all the way!!. We were out in Arizona this past summer and my boyfriend told me about this place and we got food there and I was blown away. It was incredible I love their bread, and the chicken. I kinda wish they have this place in San Diego.
4 very good chicken for a fast food place. juicy meat in the chicken fingers and it tastes awesome dipped in the Cane's dipping sauce. I like that you get big pieces of actual chicken. I did not like the coleslaw, but I'm not a fan of coleslaw in general. the sweet tea is great - not TOO sweet like at most places. the worst thing about my meal was the fries. they serve the crinkly cut fries like you used to get with your cafeteria meal in elementary school. no flavor at all to the fries.   I'd definitely eat here again, but if given the choice between here and Chick-fil-a, I'd rather eat at Chick-fil-a because they use more flavor in the breading on their chicken and their waffle-cut fries are MUCH bettter than the fries here.
5 For a fast food place, this is 5 stars.  Excellent chicken fingers - juicy with a think breading.  Their Texas Toast is delicious too. Fries are average - but i am a sucker for a crinkle fry.   Service is always friendly and my order is right every time - which isn't always the case for fast food.  If you want delicious fast food this place is great.
4 Great fast food, chicken was fresh and all white meat, zero fat with a great breeding. Fries were adequate, and toast was awesome!  I hardly eat fast food but when I do this is on the list.
3 For specializing in chicken I felt it was lacking in flavor... There is no seasoning. Chicken was all white meat and very fresh but just like food you could make at home. They don't carry ranch for the chicken/fries only their famous canes sauce or honey mustard neither of which I like the taste of.. Reason for 3 stars was excellent customer service and very clean and well kept inside. ps my b-friend did like the canes sauce tho. Prob won't return... no real reason to.
5 Excellent.  The chicken fingers are the best i have had, anywhere.  Lightly battered, crispy, hot, delicious.  The staff is warm and inviting, and they came around to check on us mid-meal. Nowhere else fast-casual do you feel so welcome.  Delicious, clean, lovely.
5 Tried this place for the first time tonight, and was impressed with absolutely everything. Well-lit building in a decent location in the Arcadia area. I drove here from the Garfield neighborhood and it was well worth it. Juicy chicken and awesome cafeteria throwback crinkle fries, along with one of the best slices of toast I've ever had. All three of these foods were still crispy when I got home, which almost never happens with fast food. I wish I had gotten the girl's name who took care of me. She was cute as a button- very enthusiastic and happy to answer my questions. I'll be back here soon!
5 fresh chicken and the dipping sauce is awesome. sounds funny but they have the best ice for drinks
5 Again another hometown (LA) food that has come to the valley and we stop in whenever we get into town.  The chicken is great, the fries are crinkle cut and I love the bread on top!  But the best part is the "Sauce"!  The restaurant is clean, the food is good and I love the sauce!
4 I visited for the first time today.  The customer service was great.  The gal that took my order (I can't remember her name although she offered it) was very helpful explaining the menu.  The food was yummie and the service quick.  I like it!!
4 I love this place. It reminds me of Zaxby's from the South. Simple good food, dipped in tasty sauce.   I always like getting the Big Box meal so I can have the coleslaw, but I find the coleslaw tastes too salty for my liking. It's the one thing that makes me a little sad, but it won't stop me from enjoying everything else.  Service today was great, every single employee seemed to have great customer service skills, which was refreshing for a fast food joint.
5 I am a bit of a chicke finger connoisseur. In my humble opinion this is the best chicken finger specific joint in the country. Chicken is fresh, breading isn't too substantial, sauces are homemade and fresh, garlic bread is great compliment,  and the krinkle cut fries are excellent. If i have one complaint it is they don't have BBQ sauce. Luckily the sauces they do have are outstanding. Any city my wife and I visit that has a Cane's it is a requirement that we visit!
4 Yup in n out of chicken
5 I took my first trip to Raising Cane's on Memorial Day! First the the young lady Kendall provided excellent customer service from a polite introduction to great service for all my needs. Second the quality of the food was great and was visibly hot and fresh. Overall I give my experience a 10/10 and recommend Raising Cane's not only for the great food but great service!
4 Yummy chicken fingers, great sauce and friendly service!  I really like this chain that has only recently entered the Valley. The restaurants are nice and clean, decorated in fun style with movie posters and other pop culture memorabilia on the wall. Each restaurant also seems to support its local high school sports teams and many of the workers likely come from those schools.  Service has been very friendly, you order and they bring the food to your table. Going through the drive-through is very quick as well.  As for the food, they keep the menu simple: chicken fingers, fries, and Texas toast. The breading on the chicken fingers is tasty and I really love the special dipping sauce they provide - not sure how to describe the flavor except that its really good.  Overall, Raising Cane's is a great addition to the Valley's fast food scene.
5 Delicious!  My son is addicted to the chicken and Texas toast.  The service is always very pleasant and the food is always fresh and hot.  Very rarely have I had much of a wait in the drive thru line.  Definitely a crowd pleaser with the high school students in the area!
4 Good chicken. I love their sauce!  Fast and friednly service too.
4 good food but my cashier was not very smart when it came to math she tried to charge me an extra .30  and for some strange reason the place had a smell of fried catfish
5 First time here and we were greeted by the very friendly staff! We got our food quickly even though it was busy. Amazing chicken, toast, fries, coleslaw and of course their special dipping sauce. I felt like I got a large amount of food for what I paid, but the quality didn't suffer whatsoever. The food is just awesome!!! Can't wait to come back!
5 I have an addiction to chicken fingers. I eat them at every chance I get. So my husband searched online and found Raising Cane's. To our great interest, we learned about this location.  On a vacation last week to Sedona, AZ, we stopped here -- twice. First on the way to Sedona from the airport and again on the way home.  The chicken was superb -- nice breading and not overly heavy so the emphasis was really on the chicken. I just got fingers. My hubby got a box meal with fries, Texas Toast and sauce, all of which was excellent, too. And quite filling! There was no need for more food after our initial order, unless it was to take it with us..  But what really stood out for me, was the staff. The young woman who took our order, Falicia, was as friendly as could be and highly competent, going out of her way to help us with directions to the Desert Botanical Garden, where we were headed after our meal.  Now, consider how many customers she served in the week we spent in Sedona. When we returned yesterday, she was there again and when she saw us, the first thing she said was, "How was the garden?" For real? We're THAT important that you remember helping us? Clearly, Raising Cane's -- or this location, anyway -- puts a premium on customer service. I have a zero-tolerance policy for poor customer service, so you can imagine how THRILLED and impressed I was. It felt like this young woman was an old friend and what a warm feeling.  Her colleague at the counter, Liz, was also adorable and delightful, joking around with us, while getting our order EXACTLY right.  And while we were eating, the manager came around to each table stopping to talk with patrons to ensure that everything was copacetic. I just can't say enough good things about the service at this facility.  Delicious food and outstanding service. A five-star rating on Yelp is a designation of, "As good as it gets" and this Raising Cane's restaurant richly deserves the designation. It's 1200+ miles away, but I look forward to returning.
2 Everyone is very nice in Raising Cane's. Taste is really average, nothing even close to famous chicken finger.
4 The customer service is top notch especially for a fast food joint.  I ordered the 3 piece chicken finger meal and it was good. The chicken is fried but greasy at all, on the inside the chicken is very moist and and tender not dry and overcooled like most chicken finger/ tenders.   The only downside the breading could use a little bit flavoring.  Overall the food was high quality and not to expensive, I would go back.
4 I have heard many positive things about this place so I finally had to go try it. I went with a coworker. I got the three finger combo. It came with three tenders, fries, Texas toast, and a drink. For the price, this is a great deal! The chicken and fries weren't greasy! That's really important. This location is sort of difficult to get to. There's plenty of seating and the girl that helped us was new, but very friendly. If I'm ever in the area again, I will be coming back.
5 I've always passed by this fast food restuarant everytime i went for fueling or heading out to walmart or frys. after seeing their commercials, i've decided to give them a try; and i have to say, their chicken fingers are delicious. Always fresh, crispy and tender. The Chicken Box combo was right-on. It had fresh chicken fingers, freshly toasted buttered bread, cole slaw and fries. This is my second time coming here in a week but i will try to limit my visits to once/month (i'll try :( .... )
5 Best chicken fingers I've had! Love the sauce, bread, and fries. The lemonade is really good too. I think this place is way better than chick film a! Plus it's open late if you get those late night cravings!
5 Great tasting chicken and the southern bread is wonderful. Canes sauce is a must must must.  Don't see any dessert on the menu,  only downer .. But open until midnight ! Great for late night cravings .. Great value for the amount of food per meal.
5 Love, love, love! Great food and good people working there. I do have a suggestion for them though. My dad loves your chicken but instead of just fries, coleslaw, and texas toast, he'd like to see more of a variety of sides. He'd also like to see different pieces of chicken and not just chicken fingers. I am happy with it the way it is, but you should probably increase the menu for others.
4 I was surprised by this place.  When I first seen it, I was thinking it was just another fast food joint. When I had gone in side. I was like, "whit is this, it just have chicken fingers? What gives." Then I ordered and, Wow." The food was great. And I can see why specialising in one foid type, really makes a difference. Service was good, inside was clean and well decorated.  Though the price is a bit high.
5 I LOVE this place and can't get enough of it! From their chicken strips to their Texas Toast, to their amazing coleslaw, it's ALL good! Only drawback is it's a little more expensive price-wise for my liking but hey, it's an indulgence, or a treat, when I have it. Love their food, the ambience, and the friendly staff. Once when they forgot something to put my order they just moved me on back through the line so I could get my remaining parts to my order and get me off and running.   If you're looking for a new chicken place, give Raising Cane's a shot.
3 Good food but nothing too special.  The sauce is pretty delish.  I have to say the customer service is def outstanding.  I would eat there again but it isn't something that I would be dying to eat.
4 I've eaten here twice and both times I've been pleasantly surprised by how *good* it is. I'm not normally a fan of fast food, but their chicken tastes and looks like real chicken, as opposed to some other fast food restaurants. The chicken strips, fries, and Texas toast are all very yummy.   Their staff is also very friendly and fun. The last time we drove through, one of the staff members was changing the trash bag in a trash can in our sight. She waved at us with a big smile on her face and did a funny little dance, which brought a smile to my face!
3 I really like this place because it has a lot of potential. One of the tweaks I would make is to get a decent honey mustard dipping sauce. Also, I thought calling out people's name in the restaurant with their food order was annoying. I guess I find that annoying because I was trying to get some reading in during the lunch break. I did like their ketchup dispenser. No more worrying about ketchup splattering on your shirt. Next time I'll have to take a picture of it.  This was my first time in a Raising Cane so I decided to order the Caniac which consists of 6 chicken strips plus a bunch of crinkle fries and a soda for about $8 dollars. I thought you get a lot for your money. I enjoyed the chicken strips but they would have tasted much better with the honey mustard sauce.
4 Very tasty place for a quick lunch that's hot and fresh.  They really only serve one main entree; chicken fingers.  They do that really well though.  They are tender, juicy, and the coating is light and crunchy.  The drive-through is efficient even when there's a long line.
4 Not much to talk about....great place....good food.....im not much into canes.....but the wifey loves it....nuff said.
3 Pretty good chicken fingers, good service. Hurray.
4 Chicken Fingers Don't Get Any Better Then This.   Â If you are a Chicken Finger  lover, like my nephew I encourage you to give Raising Canes a try. These Fried Chicken Fingers take a back seat to no one. Raising Canes boneless Chicken Strips and dipping sauce are hard to beat.Â    Raising Canes never-frozen chicken tenderloins are fryed-to-order and accompanied by the best dipping sauce known to man.  The meat stays juicy, none of the dryness problems that plague lesser variations of fried chicken strips. The Chicken Strip combo box is served with crinkle cut fries, Texas toast, and a side of coleslaw.  You have to try the fresh squeezed lemonade, it's the best.   Raising Canes has quick service and friendly staff, so if your in the mood for chicken fingers, head on over.
1 Had lunch here Saturday and was up all night with food poisoning. Thought I was going to die. Will not be eating here again the rest of my life. Can I guarantee that I got if from here no. But 8 hours after lunch I was dancing around the bathroom. Worst pain I have had in years. Just check to make sure your chicken in done that all I have to say.
5 Love this place! They have the most flavorful and juicy tenders anywhere!   They are also a very charitable organization and that is something I respect!
2 I had a late night craving for chicken and searched for a restaurant.  This was my first time at this diner. Both the parking lot and restaurant's interior were very clean.  I didn't check out the bathrooms. I was disappointed that this place only sells chicken fingers, very few sides and NO desserts.  .  what few choices were left, were also pricey.  I ordered the sandwich for my daughter and 3 chicken finger combo for myself.  While the chicken tasted like "real" chicken, it lacked the seasoning I'm used to and had more breading than meat for me.  The cole slaw was kinda off, but the fries were on da money.    Nevertheless, I won't be eating here again, as I was looking for chicken pieces not tenders.
