2 This Location is closest to me being less than a mile away from my home, but my past experiences has me driving 4 miles to tatum and bell for the 24 Hour location (also because of their amazing service and good food) every time i have been to this location it has been a bad experience especially with employees who have terrible accents and are very hard to understand in-person or through the drive-thru window which gets very frustrating on my end and on there end which has even led to one of the employees talking to me like i was a baby which i was very unhappy about plus with the drive-thru window the service inside and out is slow as hell, and as for the food, it's always wilted and looks as though its been sitting out for awhile without being changed. as for the drive-thru, the audio quality at the crappy looking menuboard is awful, almost impossible to communicate through causing confusion, and frustration amongst the customer and the employees  pros: it's subway, close to my house  Cons: Service quality is bad, and the employees are hard to understand and are extremely impatient as well as unfriendly, the drive-thru audio quality is impossible to communicate through. food is gross looking, and taste is not far behind.   conclusion: i would definitely not recommend this location to a friend but if you absolutely had no choice i guess you could always put up with the crap the employees dish out in-store and in the drive-thru
1 So this was the first and the last time I will ever go to this subway. After purchasing a footlong feast with spinach bell pepper and onion and mayonnaise on it I got back to my shop and the spinach was black I went back after eating half my sub I noticed the black spinach I went back to get my money back this trip on trying to remake my sandwich after me telling them no they only reimbursed me for half of my foot long this is not a good customer service act me being in customer service not to mention you can hardly understand anything the employees say
