4 Conveniently located near the Strip, the Drive-Thru window with saturday hours, and located near my job, easily makes this one my go-to credit union (out of the four locations around the valley). The wait for the drive-thru window is not very long (maybe two or three cars at most), as some members prefer to walk in- but then again, I usually go on a weekday during my lunch break. The tellers are very nice.
5 Just opened account, received wonderful service and so far so good.  The checking account had no fees and includes rewards as well.  Impressive that checks and debit cards can all be made on-site.
2 The locations are limited. So far so good and unable to create an online profile. I do NOT like having to call to set anything up. It's frustrating for those who work.
