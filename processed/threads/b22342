5 If you are looking for help with a mortgage, refinance, or help with an investment, I would strongly suggest talking to Dave Jackson with AFL.

5 We worked with Dave T.  and  Ashlee at  American Financial Lending on refinancing our home.  This was the best experience we had with the lending institution. Both , Dave and Ashlee, were extremely helpful. They did a lot of work on our "conditions" for us. Dave made sure that the entire process cost us as little as possible and we got the most cash out from the transaction. Dave also arranged for the notary to come to our home for the closing at no charge to us. Dave and Ashlee were there for us every step of the way and answered all of our questions. We highly recommend American Financial. They are number 1 and do not look any further!
