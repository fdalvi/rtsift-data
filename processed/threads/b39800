5 Boars Head meats and cheeses .... Salads are great and burgers are the best by far .... Yummy
2 The sandwich was tasty, especially if you like a LOT of bread.  The fries I ordered were so delicious, even the staff members couldn't resist eating them while making my sandwich! (I saw two employees eating fries through the hole in the kitchen wall, as my sandwich was presumably being made).   Maybe that's why the quantity of fries was so small.  The staff seemed inexperienced. Won't be back because I prefer thin bread, and I don't enjoy seeing employees eating my fries in the prep area while laughing and making awkward eye contact with me at the counter mid-chew.
2 Second time here and for sure my last. My first visit I was the second order in the window and it took 15 minutes for my sandwich. Today I was the 3rd in the window and it took 30 minutes. 30 MINUTES for a sandwich?! It's in a fast food court for petes sake. And my sandwich came out looking like a sloppy joe and wasn't even made how I asked. I ate it anyways in fear it would take another 30 to fix it. Now I'm suffering from a stomatch ache. Ps they eat while they work, sanitary? Never again!
1 The sandwich I ordered was worth about 1/3 of what I paid for it. Nothing special, bland and boring.
5 Had the egg and cheddar panini. Wow really good! Totally fresh with none of that fast food plasticity you find at so many other chains. Great coffee as well. Nice discovery!
5 I highly recommend you this place!  1. Friendly and professional staff 2. Super clean place 3. Big menu with really good and healthy choices  4. Different from what you can find at fashion show mall's food court  5. Reasonable prices   As a employee of the mall I will for sure go back to this place, I highly recommend it to all the mall employees they even offer employee discount!
