5 I took a suitcase here to have a zipper replaced and I could not be happier with their work! My suitcase's zipper was replaced and it now works better than ever - all the zippers do because they worked their magic and made them all run smoother than ever - and they even took the time to move the tassel from the old zipper to the new one! This place is highly recommended - it will defiantly be my go-to for repairing shoes, luggage, etc...
5 My 10 year old got a pair of boots from my dad who has als. Obviously these meant the world to my little boy but the heel broke of one. I first took them up the street parodies family who quoted 45.00!!!!??? I could glue the heal for 1.75 myself. He said he need to do both pairs. Anyway I decided to get a second opinion and came here. They fixed the one by redoing it for only 15.00!!!  I'm very happy and pleased with them. The boots were probably not worth much but I was treated as if they were.
1 Resoled motorcycle boots only lasted two rides.  When I brought them back with new soles they said they'd attach them using "stronger glue".  When the new soles didn't fit I said forget it and asked for a refund.  They refused - even after I suggested they probably should have used the "stronger glue" the first time.   I'll never go near that place again and wish I'd put the $50 towards the replacement boots....
