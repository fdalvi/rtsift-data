5 I recently came into this location after another one of their locations was out of the product I wanted.  The two female team members I spoke with were both awesome.  They provided me awesome customer service with out "pouncing" on me the second I entered the door.  They welcomed me and allowed me to do my shopping without making me feel suffocated (like I had at the location that was out of my desired product).  These two ladies were personable, polite and knowledgeable.  I would definitely go to this location over the other again when in the area.
4 Nice place to get stuff for the wife. Friendly staff always!
