5 Great service, super friendly and a great selection! I called to verify they had what I wanted in stock, made an appointment and was in and out in about an hour for four tires. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a good deal on good quality tires! It's also great to find a place with great customer service from the techs to the office!
1 Quite literally the worst experience I've ever had taking my car into a shop.  A few weeks ago I found myself desperate for an oil change. This was the first place I called that could get me in the same day and it is fairly close to my office. As I pulled up I had a feeling that I should've just immediately left  - the place looks scary from the outside and the barbed wire fence is extremely uninviting. I went against my gut feeling and I decided to take my appointment as scheduled and boy do I regret it!  After giving them the keys to my car and waiting patiently for 45 minutes one of the "technicians" came out to the waiting area and asked for my assistance in the back to take a look at my hood. After changing my oil he must have tried closing the hood while there was something blocking it from shutting. My hood no longer closed properly and was roughly a 1/4" off. To fix this cost me $200 at the Infiniti body-shop.  As if that wasn't bad enough, less than a day after my oil change I noticed my car was leaking oil! I took it in the Infiniti maintenance center for an inspection and they told me that my oil pan has been punctured. Another $200 repair.  In total their poorly done oil change ended up costing me over $430 for their fee and the repairs.  Do not trust these people with your car!
