5 I have been coming to NODIS for about three months now - I am hooked, committed!  They have the most unique fitness regimen I have ever experienced, and I have tried many different fitness centers and physical therapists.  I really feel like I am being helped, and I am having a good time. I am sort of afraid to tell people about NODIS, but not being selfish, I have to because it is that good!  Look it up at theshifter.com.
5 NODIS changed my body, and honestly, my life. I've worked out my entire life, but until now have never found anything more effective -both physically and mentally. And, it's really fun!
