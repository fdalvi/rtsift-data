5 10-30-13 I am very pleased with Integrity Tree Service. A crew of 4 arrived on time, performed the work as agreed upon in a very professional manner. The entire crew was courteous and task oriented. Any debris was removed immediately.  I was so pleased with the results, I added a bit more trimming, at a very fair price. I will definitely use Integrity Tree Service in the future and would highly recommend the team. Diane V.
1 Set up date/time for estimate.  No one showed up or called.  I called office to confirm that the appointment was on calendar, which they confirmed.  When will these businesses learn to respect their customers" time?
