4 Soma intimates really has nice stuff that will make you feel like a minx without feeling like a tart. haha  The staff was really nice and helpful, too.  The have everything from bras to robes for a reasonable price.  If you're outgrowing or have never been into the idea of Victoria's Secret or Fredrick's, check this place out.    See ya there!
5 I went there for the first time last week. I found that I really liked the looks of their sleepwear(I'm big into night gowns) and they happened to have a large selection of night gowns. I was in a hurry to get home the first time I went there so I got a night gown in my normal size medium. I got home and tried it on and found out I was a small. I ended up going back to the store a few days later to do an exchange. The staff was friendly and helpful when it came down to my exchange and even helped me select a nice dress that they had just gotten in that day. I was pleased with the service and the products that I selected from the store. I will defantely be shopping there again!
2 Went in and was sized for a bra. I was told that I was wearing the wrong size and suggested a different size.  They did not carry the different size so the fitter/salesgirl suggested I make the compromise to buy the same wrong size I had previously come in wearing.  Silly.
