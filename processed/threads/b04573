4 As had been a custom for years in Texas, we went last night for a milkshakes.  As is expected, the chocolate was thick, mixed to the bottom and slightly too chocolaty.  After suffering lame and incomplete attempts at shakes in CA restaurants, it's really nice to be within reach of a solid shake maker.  The only thing we missed, was a warm apple pie.  :)
3 Compared to other Whataburger stores, this one is not as clean.  The food is good though but we just saw a whole bunch of dirty tables.  Coming here always brings back good memories from my hometown.  Love the taquitos!
4 Love this Whataburger, especially their breakfast...BUT. We sat in the drive-thru line for 15 MINUTES waiting for two bacon breakfast sandwiches with hash browns & coffee!! The service on this Sunday morning was less than exemplary!  UPDATE:  I spoke with the manager of the restaurant, who promised me that he would investigate and take care of the situation. He offered two free meals in return for our "return," which to us is well worth it because we love Whataburger!
