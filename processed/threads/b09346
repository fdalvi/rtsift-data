5 A great local bakery for business's. If you own a restaurant in the east valley and you serve baked goods check these guys out. The only item that is lacking are their bagels, but they have challah hamburger buns so they loose no points in my book for that one. Very nice staff to work with, even when I forget to call my order in before the deadline ;)
5 I love the Sourdough bread these folks bake. Not a long shelf life, but with bread this good, it doesn't sit around long. They also have a rosemary focaccia that's hard to pass up.
5 This bread is to die for . Absolutely yummy . I hear they make bagels too!
