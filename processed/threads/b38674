3 You can always tell a great mexican food place by its guacamole. I went to vaqueros because it was nearby and I love small stands like this. I ordered the chips and guacamole and horchata.  Horchata was great as it usually is, but the chips and guacamole was not that great. The guacamole seemed like it was squeezed out of a tube and the chips were not good. With the Horchata, I paid over $5 total. Chips and Guacamole and a Large Soda at Chipotle is $4.85 plus tax, so its about the same cost, but Chipotle was much higher quality in my opinion (and faster).   My overall rating is that Vaqueros is a good mexican food stand, but not fantastic. I would go here again and order something different.
5 Aww man was iy good. Well as the name says vaqueros Carne Asada we got te carne asada burro, fries, and torta. All were exceptional and a quesadillas that was massive. My kids loved the quesadillas and we thoroughly enjoyed our food the burro was the best. Filled with pico de gayo cilantro and guacamole. I love the way the place looks it is cool and fun. Will be back if I'm in the area.
