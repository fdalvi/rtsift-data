5 Yummy Thrifty ice cream, snowie treats, and world famous smoothies....
5 Found this place by accident. We love the Thrifty Ice Cream shop. We will be frequent customers here for both the ice cream and the bottled water.
5 This place, it's owners, their candy and ice cream selections and their deals are a godsend.  $19.95 got us a brand new 5 gallon jug with a spigot and wide mouth opening on top (perfect for Burning Man and other such summer festivals and makes it easy for putting ice and other things in it) filled with clean water and will only cost 25 cents a gallon to refill.  Owner assured me that they're working on securing Alkaline water also.  They sanitized the bottle for us before filling it and everything came with a friendly smile and little jokes here and there.  Great energy in this place.  Highly recommended!
2 Good place to get ice cream water whatever u need staff is awesome only downside is they don't have enough room to keep out all the ice cream flavor they have out so if u have a taste for something it may not be out
