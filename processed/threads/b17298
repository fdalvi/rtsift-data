5 Doug always has new information on pools and how to handle different issues that might come up with your pool.  He has always done a good job and I would highly recommend using him for any repairs or monthly pool service!
5 After moving into a foreclosed home, we needed help getting the pool up and running. Doug came out to cleanup the pool, teach us to run the equipment, backwash the pool, balance the chemicals. He has since been back out to fix some broken equipment. In between visits I have called him multiple times with questions and he always is very patient, taking time to walk me through the steps needed to address the problem. I would recommend Desert Gator Pool Service to any one in need of help. They are honest, knowledgeable, quick to respond to phone calls and service requests and they are friendly as well. We feel very well taken care of with their services.
5 You can't get better then Desert Gator Pools! Thank you for excellent service every time!
5 Doug and his team are amazing. I used them a few years back to look at our equipment and our pool for some patch work. They were so honest!! I have recommended them twice to close friends and they have been very satisified. I will be calling on them again for some more pool work this month!
5 We had an issue with cracking and peeling of our Kool deck, and Doug found a deeper problem around the skimmer basket. We got 3 other estimates, and only one would even try to repair the skimmer basket issue! Doug and crew were very efficient and professional. I was very pleased with the quality of their work too. They replaced an old single speed pool pump with a newer multi speed pump, and WOW what a difference in efficiency! Our electric bill went down significantly!  Use these guys for ANY pool problem you may have, they are awesome!
