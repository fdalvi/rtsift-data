5 Andrea Solis is the one u can talk to, with no problem at all! She's a super nice lady.   Fuchi speaks Chinese! Wow.... Good explore!
1 Rude, that's all i have to stay about the staff and service at this branch.
5 This Bank of America is by far the best one in town! The staff is very friendly and quick with the transactions. They have multiple drive-thru lanes so I never have to wait long. I have been 20 times or so within the last year and I always leave with a smile on my face.
