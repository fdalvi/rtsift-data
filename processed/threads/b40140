5 One of the more qualified, professional, and therapeutic massages around. I consider myself unlucky to be so far away but I make it a point to spend my 90 minutes whenever I'm in town.  Simply put, fantastic.
5 I've had quite a few massages in my time so I would consider myself a pretty good judge when it comes to assessing the skills of a trained masseuse.  After having a few treatments I would rank Tara up there with the best of them, no questions asked.    While she does possess great strength she uses it gracefully, applying pressure where it needs it.  I personally prefer a deeper, more throughout type massage and for that style Tara has always performed well.  I would highly recommend Tara, you won't be disappointed!
5 I love everything that Linger Longer has to offer! The massage I receive is absolutely as GOOD AS IT GETS! I have been receiving professional massages since I was very young & Tara is beyond gifted! She is my favorite! Every time I receive a massage from Tara I feel like I am reborn on a soul level. She is very intuitive & does my body wonders! Just recently I started integrating private yoga into my life & it has opened up a whole new world of healing & growth on every level! I highly recommend booking a massage right away!
