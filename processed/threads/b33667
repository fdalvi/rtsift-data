5 If you need to mail something go see the owner of this place.  He is usually there and is super helpful.  I had used this store many times and he would help me tape boxes up, make sure my items are boxed correctly, jsut overall a helpful guy.  He is a business owner that cares about his customers and he is worth the extra TLC that I won't get at my local post office.  Give him some business next time you are in the area?  I try and sent all my shipments out from his store now.
5 I thought I left a review already Hhhmmm.. Ok. Great local mail center. It's nice to have right here since I hate going to the post office. Ugh. Snow Birds are coming back soon. They don't come to this side of town (well unless its Senior Movie Day!) so it's nice for us local residents to have a place to go, get in and out quick. Always with a smile.
5 Top Shelf Service , Value added services , Tell them your struggle they have a solution. Knows his business.
5 Had to send a package out to my daughter recently.  Anytime I need to send something somewhere, Westside Mail Center is the place I go.  Great service and always so helpful unlike other places I've been. Definitely recommend!
5 Really great service!  It's a one-man operation but he does everything from USPS, UPS, FedEx, to DHL.  He has mailing supplies and stationery.  Extra services include faxes, scans, and if you want to send him a document you can do so via a secure email and he'll print it await your instructions.  The owner is super friendly and very helpful.   After discovering this place, I definitely won't be going anywhere else for my mailing/packaging needs!
