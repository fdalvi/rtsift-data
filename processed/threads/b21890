2 The staff is nice, but the clothing is super overpriced. $40 for a plain t-shirt? No thanks.
1 Eeegh. Blegh. Nopenopenope. I don't often write negative reviews on Yelp, because I don't like to be a downer, but for American Apparel, I'll do my best. My biggest problems:  1. Way overpriced. $30-$40 for a t-shirt? This is, almost literally, a line from a Macklemore song, and that fact alone does not bode well to me.  2. Made in the USA, sure. Also happens to be made by a company with very questionable ethics and ads, and a CEO (Dov Charney) with a background of sexual harassment and general creepiness that would make Charlie Sheen AND Terry Richardson blush. At the same time.  3. Clothes are underwhelming. I've seen plain, monochromatic t-shirts, sweatshirts, and tights at...well, just about any store anywhere. H&M in particular comes to mind, and even thrift stores have clothes like AA's. Heck, sometimes they actually DO have AA stuff.  I know one retail store doesn't always reflect the entire company, but in a multinational retailer like AA, it often does. And when supporting the store means supporting this company as well as putting more money towards a big chain store with a bad rap...not worth it. I'll pass every time.
