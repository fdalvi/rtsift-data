5 I am so pleased with the Bell Collision center. My vehicle received some very unwanted damage in a parking lot, I was devastated. I have purchase both of my Honda's from Bell Honda and so all of my service there so I gave the Bell Collision center a call.  I worked with Tullio and he quickly set me at ease. My truck was back to new in no time. He was very good about keeping me up to date and was very respectful of my time. All of their staff was so friendly and helpful. I would refer them to anyone!
5 These guys are super professional and work with all the insurance companies.  The manager, Chris is the best and I always recommend my customers to him and his crew!
