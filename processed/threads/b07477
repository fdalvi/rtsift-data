5 If you take your Honda/Acura to a dealer instead of letting Ivan or Frank take care of it, you are making a huge mistake. Ivan & Frank are the best Honda/Acura mechanics in the whole valley. The prices are very fair & the work is top quality, second to none. They have been at this location for many years. They really care about you & your car. They are honest & friendly. Call before going because they are very busy. They are the best!  602-274-4688  Mon:  7:30AM - 5:00PM Tue:  7:30AM - 5:00PM Wed:  7:30AM - 5:00PM Thu:  7:30AM - 5:00PM Fri:  7:30AM - 5:00PM Sat:  CLOSED Sun:  CLOSED
5 Ivan and his staff have been keeping my Hondas running for over twenty years.  They are honest, dependable and cute.  What more could you want???  Go there.  You will add them to your Christmas list!
5 My son goes to Grand Canyon University and we have no family and we are from California.  My wife found this place via Google and after talking to Ivan, I found him to be straight forward and sincere.  I had my son's car towed to his shop and he took care of the car with care and at a fair price.  I am very pleased with this place and will recommend to all Honda and Acura users.  I have all Acura's in our family and I have a local mechanic I bring my cars to and he is awesome (in Sacramento CA).  I feel I found a place in AZ.  I do recommend this shop and will take my car to this shop again if needed.
