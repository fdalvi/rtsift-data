1 Friendly staff, but horrible crust on that Pizza Mia.  I admit, I was starving, desperate, and being cheap.  Mistake made.
1 Incredibly rude staff. Wrong order was delivered and the lady hung up rudely for $1.50 of wrong order. Watch out ordering at this place these guys are awful.
1 Hadn't ordered Pizza Hut in a long time thought I would give it a try again because it was close and I had three teenagers to feed. Ordered online and waited extra time to pick up because this location has never had any pizza I ordered ready on time. Arrived and my order was ready but incorrect. Plus found out that even if you order two orders of wings they charge you 50 cents for each ranch. They don't give one or two anymore. Everywhere else does. Guess this is how they have to recoup money plus some for all the $10 pizzas.   My options for the incorrect order: wait 10 minutes for another correct pizza while the rest of my order sits or 2) a credit for next time. Considering I was reluctant to order to begin with plus had to pay for ranch I opted for neither. I can get a $10 pizza from Oggies thanks to yelp. Better pizza, same price, and I don't pay for ranch.   In business little things become big things in regards to customer perception and "sorry I don't make the rules" even in an apologetic and innocent wish i could help way, doesn't make me a repeat customer.
5 Brought the girls and ordered a meat lovers on thin crust to go. 20 minutes later we had a great large pizza and we ate the whole thing! Customer service here is great.
