1 grungy, gross, depressing atmosphere at this office.  dr licata was very short, impersonal, and unnecessarily rude during the entire consult.  i will never ever consider a return visit to this office.
1 This place was awful! Bad service from the receptionist and doctors were quick and impersonable. I've been here twice with incorrect diagnosis leading me to see another physician. Bottom line avoid this place.
1 Worst Dr. I have EVER been to!  He is very degrading and said horrible things to me.  He acted like I didn't know anything and tried to pin my sweet husband against me. He is a creep!  Stay away from this office!  It is nasty, old, dirty, and the Dr. and staff is just terrible!  I walked out of my appointment because I didn't deserve such horrific things said about me. DO NOT GO!!!!!!!
1 Terrible.  My brother had the flu, fever for a few days with cough, painful joints, etc.  I started showing symptoms of coughing, tingly throat, and chills.  I went into this office hoping for a correct diagnosis of flu virus and possibly getting antiviral prescription (which work best within first 48 hours).  They didn't test me at all for viral or bacterial infection and sent me home with an antibiotic and prescription of coughing meds.  6 hours later, I have 103 fever.  Thanks for worthless waste of my time.  I could have used it to rest instead.
