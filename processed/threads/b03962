5 This is your place for no-nonense helpful and friendly service.  I called a couple of days ago inquiring on a new Reebok shoe as my main brand PUMA has not come out with any new appealing running shoes.  Looked at the SA website and they had a pair of red and black Reebocks.  These looked sharp and were part of their my flex line.  I've never worn Reebocks before so I called this store to see if they had this style in the color and size I wanted.  They had just gotten them shipped so they were not on the floor but in the back.  The associate from the shoe department took the time to check to see if they had my size.  They did and he told me to allow 2 days to come in and get them so they could get them unloaded from the freigh truck.  I came in yesterday asked about them and they went to the back and got them for me with a smile.  The shoes fit great and were very breathable which is a plus in Phoenix especially this time of year.  I also found a red pair of underarmour shorts and asked at checkout if I could use both of my 20% off coupons as both items were not at Camelback store and they said yes.  The experience here is so simple and no-nonsense. I left very happy, very sporty and soon very red.
