4 Great place to go for a pub lunch; the food is good and the prices are really decent.  There are little nooks in which you can sit and have a pint with your mates and have some privacy, or you can hang around in the bar area.    There are TV screens in multiple places around the pub and they frequently show football matches. I remember watching Scotland be absolutely embarrassed by the Faroe Islands here back in 2002. Throngs of folk were walking up the stairs to leave 30 minutes into the match, heads hanging. It was awful.     Regardless of that match, this is one of my favorite pubs to grab lunch and watch football.
