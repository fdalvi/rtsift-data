2 Dirty nasty gas station.  The gas didn't blow my car up, and it made it work...but the lot was dirty, all the trash bins were over-flowing..  so since the gas did pump had to get up a star to 2
4 The entire staff is awesome here. No matter how busy it gets, they are on top of it. And very friendly. And they have a beer cave - every place should have a beer cave.
1 Store is closed down and no longer there. It has been bulldozed
