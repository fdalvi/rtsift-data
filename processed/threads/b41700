5 Don't let the outside of this bar fool you, it's super nice and new on the inside.  I check out most bars when they first open.  Fantastic reverse happy hour, Sunday through Thursday.  The apps were delicious and cheap, as were the drinks!  There's mini TVs at every table so it would be a great place to watch a game.  Servers were nice and attentive, no complaints at all!
5 I live right down the street, saw the "NOW OPEN" signs and had to try it.  I was greeted by a really friendly waitress and pretty much had the choice of any table in the joint since I went there at 10PM on a Monday.  I had never eaten there before so the waitress recommended the Philly Cheese Steak and Waffle fries.  I picked the "Original" which came with onions and whiz.  I think it was like 10 bucks for a footlong.  I would give a rating of A+ because their Philly Cheesesteak  GPA is definitely above a 4.0.  Hot whiz, tender steak, soft bread, the best waffle fries around, and you cant forget the pepperochinis.  Pair that with an ice cold Kiltlifter or Hanger 24 (a Blue Moon analog that is IMHO 50x better than BM) and you have a recipe for a delicious experience that will blow Corleones out of the water.  As for the sports bar part of it, they had like 10 TVs around the bar showing a nice variety of shows (Barrett Jackson, CNN, Basketball Games etc.) as well as personal screens at most of the booths.  I really hope their business picks up because they hooked me on the first try.  I will definitely be going back to Philly's to get my cheesesteak on.
4 We are from out of town and were looking for a place to watch the World Cup. This place was perfect. A screen at our table and big screens all around. Beer selection was great and service was awesome. Will definitely return.
