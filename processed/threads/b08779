5 Loved using Ollie the Trolley for wedding transportation last year!  It was plenty roomy of course, but I was shocked how many people commented that they loved the fact that we used a local trolley.  Price was reasonable and the drivers were prompt!  They even let us make a few unplanned stops for snacks, aka beer. :-)  Thanks Ollie, you rock!
4 Ollie the Trolley is a cool way to get around Scottsdale and the surrounding area.  Especially during Spring Training when they add several more trollies and you can get around to the two stadiums in Scottsdale without having to find a parking space.  Before we moved here we visited a few friends who took us on the trolley and since then it's been one of those signature Scottsdale images that I have in my mind.  We always recommend it to our visitors.  Return Factor - 90%
