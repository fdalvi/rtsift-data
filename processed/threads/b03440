5 I LOVE this store.  LOVE it.  I've visited many light stores in the valley including all the stores that start with "H" and multiple stores on Scottsdale Road slightly north of the Kierland area as well as Lowe's and Home Depot.  The quality, range, selection and price are absolutely phenomenal.  In early summer they have a fan sale, 2 for the price of 3.  The price starts right above Home Depot pricing for lights, but the quality is far better than what you can find at the chain stores.  If you are shopping for lights, definitely need to make a stop here.
5 Great customer service!  I had a lamp that I thought would require drop off and potential costly replacement parts. What a pleasant surprise to be greeted warmly and attended to promptly and told the issue was so minor the person who assisted me handed me back the lamp in seconds flat, showing me how to resolve the situation should I ever encounter one like it again.    While there, I took the opportunity to browse around their extensive showroom that offers a extensive variety of selections in all styles and price ranges at very competitive prices. Definitely a store that I will be going back to for my future lighting needs. So glad I found it!
5 I had a small lamp that broke during a move.  Since I am new to the area, I was concerned that I would be ripped off from a store I was unfamiliar with.  I brought in my lamp and was greeted by Becky.  She was able to handle my repair within seconds at no charge. I appreciated the quick attention (turns out my problem was minor) and the fact that they didn't make me drop it off and charge for a repair.  I will most definitely be back!
