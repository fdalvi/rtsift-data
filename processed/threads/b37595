5 Mike at Majestic did a fantastic job on our tile floors. It had been six years since we had them professionally cleaned... and the light grout had turned very dark. Majestic made them nearly new! They look amazing. And it didn't take all day. Professional, proficient, affordable and great results. I highly recommend them. Having our carpets cleaned next!
5 Mike cleaned my floors and painted the grout in my kitchen -- I am thrilled with the results! He was on time, reliable, fast, and did a great job.
5 Mike came at 11pm to restore and clean my tile & carpet from a minor bathroom flood, not only did he do an AMAZING job but not many companies will show up on an emergency in the middle of the night! :) Then at 9:30am the very next morning he came back to check if everything was dry and to my satisfaction !!!! Wow! So professional, fast, thorough and polite! Couldn't ask for better! Also, he got out a stain from what my "rug tape" left on the carpet, Stanley Steamer couldn't!!! Thank you Mike :)
5 This guy is great. Mike cleaned my carpets and takes extra care every time. He really cares about his work and is very reasonable. Here in PHoenix where carpet cleaners are a dime a dozen it's nice to find someone who shows up when they said they would, is professional and caring, and then doesn't hit you over the head with the price.
