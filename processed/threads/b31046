5 I have had the pleasure to experience Dr. Santo's Yoga class held at Slim and Fit and I find him to be an exceptional instructor. I am a beginner at Yoga and he helped me feel comfortable and as if I was the only one in the room. His direction and correction in positioning was caring and personalized.  I am excited to continue to seek out Dr Santo's support in improving my personal Yoga practice and highlly recommend him to anyone looking to do the same.  Thank you Dr. Santo for all that you do!

5 Carlos is at a different location and I did not hire him for a specific issue. He gave me a suggestion on several things (for free!) and he was spot on. He knows his stuff! Looking for a non-tradition medical fix? Carlos has the knowledge, experience and he cares.
5 Dr. Carlos is a wonderful speaker and truly caring medical professional who brings his passion for natural livng to all things he does.
5 I have had the pleasure of knowing Dr. Santo for almost four years.  First, as a Yoga Instructor he helped me master the basics in a warm, comforting and safe environment.  Now, as my Naturopathic Physician, Dr. Santo takes care of my health care needs.  I have enjoyed services including acupuncture, nutritional IV therapy, B12 shots, hormonal testing and counseling, lifestyle coaching and nutrition education.  He takes the time to review all the factors that contribute to health and helps to find the most balanced, natural and effective approach to health.  He cares and it shows in everything he does.
