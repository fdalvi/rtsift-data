5 Food City doesn't meet my regular grocery shopping needs; however, whenever I need to buy a cake this is the first place I think of! The five stars are for the the Tres Leches cake alone!   A yellow cake moist with the three milks (evaporated, condensed and whole) but not soggy and frosted with a barely sweet whipped topping. Ordinarily more of a butter cream gal, myself, this frosting is the PERFECT compliment to the cake!   Inspired after my first try, I started experimenting with Tres Leches from other bakeries or panaderias and I have to say... Food City's was my favorite.   So, quick! Somebody have a birthday so we can get a cake!!!
5 Mexican produce at this store is top notch!  A+...Woohoo.  Great pepper selection.  VERY Reasonable prices.  We get Kale from here all the time and it is superb.  Sadly...This store has now closed and is yet another huge empty retail and eye sore in Phoenix.  The owner of the plaza apparently wants exorbitant rents based on the number of shops in that same plaza that have closed.
5 An overpowering craving for tres leches cake came my way today, so  I searched yelp for that item and Christina P's review came up. So I hopped into my chariot and headed for this Food City. It was a pleasant surprise - the place is spacious and clean, quite festive, and going around the store I found the prices to be very reasonable. Then I headed to the bakery and found the holy grail. I brought my treasure home and immediately tried it. Each "single-serving" tres leches portion was actually huge, and oooooh-so-delicious! Thanks, Christina ... I now have a new addiction!
