1 We locked our keys in our car and called Stotz for help. When they found out that we were about two blocks on a dirt road they REFUSED to come out. They said they didn't want to get their truck dirty !!! Not the kind of folks that make it easy to do business with. Especially in a small town. We eventually called another outfit and they were willing and able to assist us and had us back on the road for $75 and a thank you. Let Stotz stay at home polishing his trucks.
1 Very unprofessional!! AAA called them for us. Driver asked for 40$ more than was quoted by AAA! Told us that we had a choice either to pay the $40 extra or he would leave and we could find another tow company ! The tow company is the only one within this area!! AAA fought for us with owner and driver all while my son and I were standing in 100* heat. Stotz towing you should be ashamed of yourself and the behavior of your driver. No stars can be given but yelp wouldn't let me post without at least 1 star
5 Don't know about the Chuck(s?), but AAA dispatched Stotz on my breakdown and the service was prompt, professional and courteous. Flatbed all the way back to the house, and deposited right in the garage. Only needed a tow twice in my 40 years of driving, but wouldn't hesitate to call this one again if in their area. Biker friendly too, if that's your ride.
5 AAA dispatched Stotz for me when I ran out of gas on my bike. They showed up in about 30 minutes and had both regular and premium gas!  Very friendly and helpful.  He even made sure my bike started back up before he took off.  Awesome!
