5 Excellent bnb. David takes good care of you. The location has super easy access to city centre via bus. Busses run frequently until midnight. Safe neighborhood. He serves a mean Scottish breakfast, with an egg, bacon, sausage, black pudding, Haggis, tomato, and potato scone. The room is perfectly sized. The shower water takes long to heat up though. I spent Â£50 a night for a single room. I think this is a great deal!
4 It is a small hotel with a very friendly and helpful host. He provides you with very useful tips and hints. All together it is comfortable in British style. The rooms are small - especially if you are not travelling alone -, the walls are thin, and the furniture is somewhat run down. Nonetheless the rooms are clean. You can easily reach Edinburgh downtown by bus in about 10 minutes. It stops just in front of the hotel. The old harbour of Leith is just 15 minutes away by foot. Here you find a lot of good restaurants and pubs.
