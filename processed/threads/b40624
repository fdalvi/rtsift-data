5 My friends and I stopped in on our way back into Town and the food hit the spot! All the ingredients were fresh and made to our specifications.  The crust is especially  good.  This is one of the best pizza's I have had.  Reminds me of Italy, Its filling but doest not weigh you down, lots of fresh toppings but not greasy at all.    Service was amazing and the prices are very good- you can get a pizza for $7! - the owners make sure you are happy and satisfied.   This is now my fav pizza spot in Vegas!
5 Delicious pizza wings and fries! I was reluctant to order fries for delivery as normally when you order from somewhere by the time you get them they are soggy, cold and gross... But not here they were hot! And really crispy as well as the hot wings. The pizza has fresh ingredients and so yummy. I love this place.
4 Ordered from them yesterday. Delivery was fast and polite. Their chocolate cake, French fries and wings are awesome. Their pizza has a crispy crust and lots of toppings. They send their small sodas in a can which is better than a cup IMO. Will order from them again.
