5 My wife and I have used Mile Auto Repair exclusively for several years now. They are honest, affordable, and we always provide us with the best customer service. It is very difficult to find a trustworthy mechanic, and we've had our share of shops in the past that have tried to overcharge us for parts or sell services we didn't need on our vehicles. Now that we have Mile Auto, all of those problems are a thing of the past. We highly recommend Mile Auto and have sent many of our closest friends there as well.
5 Mile Auto Repair has provided awesome honest service for our family.  I was driving down the road when my check engine light went on.  So I immediately turned around and headed for Mile Auto.  They got me right in fixed the problem in no time.  Its nice to have an auto repair shop that you are comfortable with for routine maintenence and emergencies.
5 John did a fantastic job on figuring out my overheating issue on my Infiniti after Grelichs failed to fix my car properly. John is more than fair with there pricing and are extremely knowledgeable. He has a customer for life from me.
5 Great Service - towed my car there in the morning with a overheat problem and it was fixed by mid-afternoon. Very pleased with their service and I highly recommend.
3 Fit me in on a holiday weekend. The guys were super friendly and knowledgeable. Honest and up front. A little frustrated that I got charged the diagnostic fee for them to tell me, "Not sure, take it back to the previous mechanic." I did not refuse to pay it, I am sure it is just a policy and they were very courteous and respectful, and I respect their time they took on a holiday weekend to fit me in. Would definitely give them another shot!
