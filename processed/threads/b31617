4 **Summary**        - Quality - Nothing was cooked, everything tasted nice, and the service was excellent.        - Value - If you go in Mon - Sat at 3:30pm, you're essentially paying lunch price for a dinner buffet. **Price**        - $4.99 Breakfast 8am-11am Mon - Sat        - $6.99 Lunch 11am-4pm Mon - Sat        - $9.99 Dinner 4pm-9pm Sun - Thurs, 4pm-10pm Fri & Sat        - $9.99 Brunch 8am-4pm Sun **Available**        - BBQ Beef Ribs - Friday and Saturday nights, they have BBQ Beef Ribs on the BBQ carving station. Decently meaty and pretty great for the price. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/djAWtGq2IxKaxMIMw-P58A?select=PF1DKVOMCtrbFMAS-E-_GQ)        - Sea Bass - Their sea bass is moist and flaky.        - Roast Beef - They didn't have prime rib, but it was tender on the inside.        - Ham - Giant ham that wasn't too salty and was cooked right.        - Everything else is just normal things you find at a buffet. **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a cheap buffet. Save the ribs, nothing particularly stands out. However, given the price, you're getting a lot of bang for your buck.
3 Stopped in for Sunday Brunch. They need a bigger breakfast selection. Omelete bar was delicious.
4 My husband and I were most definately pleasantly suprised! We were so tired and starving and we were staying at arizona charlies so we didn't want to go anywhere far away. We were nervous about eating here and it was Saturday night and no line so we thought for sure we were in for it. The casheir was the nicest lady on the planet and she gave us a big fat discount! The food was amazing, everything was delicious. Nothing was old or cold or weird and the salad bar did not taste like the lettuce came out of a bag. Which makes me super happy! And our server was awsome! Everyone here was friendly and pleasant and for a buffet it was decorated kinda classy! It was so good we went back again tonight! And for the price I think it was one of the best buffets I have eaten at in a very long time.  :)  very pleased.
1 We went on a Tuesday around 12, it was very crowded. I started off with some sea bass which was good, mediterranean cauliflower- nothing special, some bland mussels, and the worst marsala chicken ever. The cooks had reused some breaded, fried chicken and smothered it in a marsala mushroom sauce. I thought the pigs got a mixture of slop from buffet waste, but the cooks had it twisted that day.   My husband said the macaroni and cheese was horrible and the fried chicken was flavorless. My Dad also didn't like this buffet. It used to be good thats why we went again.  I finished my meal off with some menudo, which was very bland and really not worth eating. The dessert selection was very small. The apple crumb cobbler and ice cream were tasty though. Overall I don't recommend this buffet.
4 Outstanding Value:    I applaud Station Casinos for charging reasonable prices for delicious food. Palace Station is the exception.   On a Saturday night, I waited on line for a couple of minutes, paid a little over $10 for the dinner buffet, and was eating delicious food.   In my opinion the high points were the Asian foods station, shrimp scampi with pasta, and soup. The one disappointment is that there was not won ton soup.   The music, the whole era of rock and roll was enjoyable listening to. The buffet was not packed, so I did not feel rushed.   I have dined here numerous times on a Saturday night, and have left satisfied and full.
4 Closest buffet to my house and within walking distance if you really wanted to hoof it. It would probably take about half an hour. With that being said I have been to this buffet countless times. My parents love this place and consistently eat here and usually eat for free because they have so many points from gambling at Boulder Station.  The prices are on the cheap. CHEAP. You can get breakfast for $5.99. Okay, that's a whole buffet for the price of a combo meal at a lot of places.   I think it's a decent buffet. Usually they have a very large selection of Mexican foods, even menudo soup sometimes. The "ethnic" (see: Chinese) section usually boasts your typical fair and of course there is pizza and pasta. Meat station usually has turkey and roast beef, although on occasion they do cornish game hens or something else meaty-tastic,  Best of all is the omelet station. They can make dang good omelets here. Although I usually always go with ham, cheese and jalapeno. However my sister had a spinach omelet and to me it looked pretty tasty!  Anyway, it's a good buffet. Is the food sometimes sub-par? Yes. But sometimes it's really good. For the cheap price, I think it's worth the gamble.
3 I have been to the Feast Buffet at Boulder Station over and over again. I have been for lunch and dinner every time so far. This is the first time I have been for breakfast. It was on Sunday for their Sunday Brunch. I have to say that I was very impressed with the brunch. Lunches and dinners have been very lacking, but this Brunch was very good. The bacon was cooked just right. It had a wonderful flavor and it and was cooked as to be not to crunchy or limp. I had a slice of ham that was so succulent and tender. I also tried three different types of potatoes. I had some mashed, au gratin, and hash browns. Each was done quite nicely and had a good flavor to them. Most of the time when I have fruit at the Feast Buffet it is not flavorful at all. This time both the watermelon and honeydew were very juicy and flavorful. I grabbed a bit of cherry cobbler and was impressed. The cherries were not to tart or sweet. The cobbler had a nice texture and flavor to it. It wasn't the best I have ever had, but I did enjoy it.  We were seated pretty quickly. We arrived before the big rush and did not have to wait to long. Our server got to us soon after sitting down. She got our refills on our drinks in a very timely manner. All in all I was impressed this time. I will be happy to give the Feast another try.
3 Well since this is a buffet, I guess I can't complain about the amount of food you get HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA  Alright, so I came here with a few friends for breakfast. The line was kind of long but it turns out one of my friends had some bonus card that reduced the line and price on groups of up to 4. That was pretty cool to pay like 6 bucks for breakfast.  French Toast- generic, solid french toast triangles. you can dress them up in cinnamon and powdered sugar later on if you want. Waffles- tiny belgian waffles that are surprisingly very good! This was the item i was pretty impressed with and went back for many.   Bacon- most of the time the pieces were very thin and a bit too crispy for me. Sausage- Juicy thin pork sausage. they went well with the french toast. I love buffet sausage though. Chicken Fried Steak- small (maybe 3 bites), but had a lot of flavor, especially with the gravy, which was being rotated consistently. A high point. Eggs- Buffet eggs....I can't stand them at all, but they had a choice of regular scrambled eggs, or "spanish" style with some peppers and onions in it which actually made them tolerable to me.  There was an omelet station but the line was ludicrous. It seemed to be legit, with 4 stations and a chef assigned to 2 each with all the traditional omelet toppings like mushrooms, ham, cheeses, peppers, etc. I'm a huge fan of buffet omelets because they are real eggs cooked fresh and to order. However I passed on it this time because of my own time constraints.  Overall, for the special price I paid for this breakfast, I definitely would have given it 4 stars, but if I had to pay full price (which is how I'm judging this), it would be 3. Definitely not the worst breakfast buffet, and matches anything you could find on the Strip.
4 Q: What would Las Vegas be without buffets? A: Only a fraction of the great city it is.  Q: What would I be without Las Vegas buffets? A: About 30 pounds less.  I like the feast buffets at all the Station Casinos but the one at Boulder Station holds a special place in my heart.  This buffet used to be in regular rotation for me when I still lived on the Eastside.  I was going there long before they updated to the Feast it is today.  An update I am happy about.  Before it changed, the former buffet was good but not great.  I usually got sick within an hour of eating there.  Not that it ever stopped me.  It sort of reminded me of that buffet in the great comedy classic "Vegas Vacation." Sometimes the food was not identifiable.    Now, however, the Feast at Boulder Station is top notch.  The salad bar is always fresh.  The Mexican section has some good food.  The Chinese section has great orange chicken and egg rolls.  The place is now modern and more classy than before.  It is clean.  The service is good.  Drinks are always filled as if by magic.  I leave for a new plate of food and when I return, my drink is filled and my empty plate is gone.  Who could ask for more?
4 We ate at the Feast buffet last night since we were staying in Henderson. It was pleasantly surprising and a good value at $9.99 with their rewards card. I met locals while waiting in line and they came here often. Last night was BBQ night and it was moist, tender and tasty. The carved meats were also good. I tried the turkey and stuffing with gravy and everything was good. What was nice is that everything seemed very fresh and nothing was dried out. The service could have been better as our server took a while to clear our plates. I would definitely come back.
3 We got a chance to eat at Feast buffet twice for free since it came with our Groupon deal for a stay at Boulder Station Casino. They have a breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffet and you get a discount if you sign up for the free players card. You really should sign up for the players card because you do get a pretty decent discount. When you go, especially during lunch time, expect to wait in a long line. The seating is limited and you have to wait to be seated. This buffet is like a glorified sweet tomatoes (if youre familiar with this chain). It has an Asian, American, Barbeque, Salad Bar, Dessert, and Mexican station. The quality is so so but like any LV buffet, you feel like you need to be rolled out once you finish. You can hit or miss at this buffet. Corn on the cob is pretty hard to butcher but the ones I got tasted like you were eating cardboard and the kernels felt like what you get out of a frozen mixed veggie bag. I really enjoyed the garlic alfredo pizza and overall i was overwhelmed by the amount of food available. I guess if youre really hungry taste doesnt really matter much. The waiters are able to get you drinks and if youre wanting alcohol options, you can pre-buy these at the counter. Be sure to tip the waiter because they really do work hard. Although the stations offer international options, they are clearly the toned down version because it lacks the authentic feel. All in all, Feast buffet is a buffet and if i had the choice, I wouldnt drive to Boulder station for the buffet but since I stayed here, it was reasonable.
3 Haven't been to all the Station Casinos yet but Feast Buffet is one of the best Ive eaten at and yet left with empty feeling. The food here was some best I've had since I've been in Vegas but the service was SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWW. I usually go around lunch time and no matter when I get there it seems to take a while to get seated and drinks, forgetaboutit. needless to say for $8.64 and free if you get enough points it's not bad
3 For the price ($9.99 for dinner, $4.99 for breakfast take the 5 mins to sign up for the rewards card so you get the low price) it was great.  The breakfast was better than the dinner.  The food for both seem fresh.  The selectoin was decent.  You have to remember that you are off the strip so it's no comparison the selection of say MGM Grand or the Rio.  The restaurant was clean and look pretty new, and the service was good.
4 I love this place because I can never chose what I want for breakfast. I always want a little of everything and I can get that here! I like everything I tasted and the service was great. The line is a problem, but if you have a club card you can cut the line and get a discount. My husband loves being able to make his breakfast into TexMex if he felt like it, and he said the have the BEST coffee.
4 For some reason I have never gone to a Feast Buffet in my 3 years here in Las Vegas, I also tend to yell "FEEEEAST" whenever I do go by one then laugh at myself because I never go to those.  Welp, I decided to finally go on a Sunday morning brunch binge and FEEEAST seemed like a good idea.  So the lady and I headed to Boulder Station and we were welcomed to a 30 minute wait, no biggie, $9 and change for some all-you-can-eat.  Everyone working was very in sync and efficient when it came to service, moving people in and out, it was quite pleasant to see such professionalism.  Anyways, I always do my best to try anything and everything.  Bacon - YES! It was decent, you can't beat all you can eat bacon.  French Toast - Spot on Tacos - No matter what I get, whenever I grab hispanic food I feel like a walking cliche.  From what I can recall it was pretty solid, I slightly prefer Sams Town AYCE Hispanic food, but I will be the first to admit I have no "good" taste for foods outside of Chinese and Sushi Fruits and Veggies - They seem to be always fresh, so good job non-obese people! (Yeah, stereotypes....weee)  I'm always a sucker for custard, is it me or does every buffet have the same exact custard machine because it's all soooooo good.  Service - Fast Atmosphere - Relaxed  I should definitely come back again to try the dinner buffet.  (Should)
3 When I moved to Vegas the Feast Buffet at Boulder Station was my very first Vegas casino buffet. While it was my first, it's not my current favorite as there are other contenders for that crown, but they also come with a much higher price tag. But when you want a solid buffet with Asian, Italian, and other ethnic options and live action stations from meat carving to Asian prep...you can't go wrong by coming here.   My last visit was for Thanksgiving as it was a reminder of how far we had come since moving here. While this year this food was not quite as good, "they didn't have pumpkin raviolis this time", the turkey and ham was perfect, the prime rib vanished, and their banana creme pie was really good.   One thing I really dislike is they charged FULL PRICE for a soon to be 3 year old. Seriously, $15 for Thanksgiving for a 2 year old, and we got some attitude from the cashiers to boot? No, I don't think so. I'm going to squawk about that. And rather than talk to a powerless manager, let me use my trusty Yelp bullhorn to say I think the pricing for kids sucks.   I would give 4 Stars, but the outright fleecing over the kids pricing rips one star completely out of consideration.
4 We tried other buffets during our first time to Vegas and this is our favorite. The ribs are fall-off the bone good. This is the only place that knew how to make real homemade stuffing. All the American food was the best. The service is good also. They clean the tables too, not just clear and put placemats over the dirty surface; yes another place did that. We very highly recommend this place.
5 Then Feast was great! We all ate so much we just about had to be wheel chaired out of the place! I recommend it highly!
4 A bit of a drive from the strip, this place has it all. I'm probably the last person who needs to be going to a buffet, as I have virtually no impulse control and can't ever really tell when I'm full, but this place was the best I've seen. Highlights sadly do not include the sushi, which I usually run to first, as it wasn't refreshed very often and didn't seem to have much variety- there were probably three rolls out the entire time we were here, and we took our time. Oh well- plenty of sushi places in vegas for me to overlook this minor detail. The highlights DO include some large and meaty meatballs, large calzone slices, some thai chicken dish that seemed to be an experiment but tasted amazing, barbecue, and about a million salads. But none of that compares to the shrimp and cheddar grits. I would go back JUST for these grits. As it is, I probably had three servings, which is now reflected in my ongoing battle with the scale. But they were damn amazing- and as a Southerner who knows her grits and has a picky palate, that's saying something. If there are any grits when you go, try them. I don't care if you think you don't like grits: you haven't had these. I've yet to find any in my local area that are as good.
3 As far as vegas buffets go, this place is pretty decent. decent quality and selection.  There is much better(strip/the M) but there is also much much worse. 3 stars
2 I went to this location for a work lunch the restaurant was able to accommodate our large group of 40 people. The wait staff would have to be the highlight of the experience. The lay out was great for large groups and the decor was fairly modern. I would say the set up of the actual buffet was rather confusing and the food served didn't seem to be the healthiest options. Most of the food was of brown or white color, not green, orange, yellow, red-- you know-- fruits and veggie options. A wide selection of desserts to tickle your after meal fancy..
4 This buffet is a bit far from the strip one needs to take the drive to this restaurant located inside Boulder Station. The prices are great for a buffet you have to get the "we love our locals" card that you can get right outside the restaurant. This card gives you a discount and you can have a dinner buffet for less than $10. There's a big selection on food it's not gourmet quality but it's definitely a great meal for people who would rather spend their money having fun on the strip.
3 Good value for $10 with a players card. Food is decent and I usually go between this one and Firelight Buffet which is down the street at Sams Town. Check them both out.
2 I could have sworn I wrote a review for this place before. I can't say I'm a fan of this buffet, or any buffet really, but I do get dragged here from time to time and since it's not too expensive, I don't put up much of a fight.   The food is very basic and I often can't find too much that I actually want to eat. On busier days, they don't seem to replace the food as often as they should and there are often empty pans sitting there for longer than they should. Spills all over and lots of reaching over food in the front to get to the back items. Not very hygienic in my opinion, but maybe I'm just overly sensitive to stuff like that.  Service is friendly and they do keep up with drink refills and can handle larger parties easily.
2 I couldn't find anything worth eating, even for the inexpensive price. Dinner was only $9.99 with a Station's Card.  I arrived at 7:30p.m. and most of the food had been sitting under the heat lamps for well over an hour. Dried out sub-par pizza, hot dogs reminiscent of a 24hour seven-eleven rotisserie, and a tiny tex-mex section that should never have emigrated from tex-Mexico are some of the fare options diners are subjected to.   Save your money and get your fill elsewhere.
4 I came here for breakfast after an early morning couponing trip at a nearby store. First off, make sure you bring your players card! I had to wait in line to get one, although the members area is located right near the buffet. Also, come early. The food was super fresh & actually really tasty.   The price: 5.99 per person for unlimited food/drink. Nice!!   Will I go back? Sure, If I am ever on that side of town around egg time!! :)   Diet friendly: Depends. My friend is a vegetarian and most items had some sort of meat in them already. They did have a fresh egg bar where they make them for you. There were not many low-cal options I noticed. Lots of egg/bread dishes... But not a ton of variety of fruit.
5 Cheap and good for lunch  I've gone to a few buffet in Vegas and for the price its so worth it.  They had a variety of food and pretty much it was all good.  There was some salads that were okay but over all the main dishes made up for it.
4 I give the Buffet 4 stars.  They were very accommodating to my family of 12.  Just coming from a funeral it was pretty draining for me and wasn't feeling all to well.   My 1st trip was to the salad bar very small limited choices but I got in my greens.  The southwestern black bean salad was the highlight.  Then I went down the food line from Asian, Chinese, skipped over the build your own pasta station, a highlight of the place by the people waiting in line.  Then there was Italian, American, southern and of course Mexican, lots to choose from so variety was good on this day.    I'm not that big of a fan of buffets anymore since 90% I'm eating healthier meals.  The healthier I eat the mire salt and sugar I notice, this place is high in salting there foods and more variety in fats.  I guess it's was tourist and Vegas people want.  $9.99 is not a bad price but you got to eat at least $9.99 or more to get you value so make sure you have an appetite
4 I recently visited this buffet and found the service to be very friendly. Our server was named Sue and she was very attentive to our needs.  I sampled a wide variety of foods during this visit. Everything tasted good! I can't complain about a single item.  The line was moderately long, at 3:30 pm   The buffet price is $9.99 per person with the promotional boarding pass that is available for free from the casino.   Overall a very pleasant experience.  I recommend this buffet

4 As far as buffets go, you can't beat $9.99 for a buffet that's loaded.  Has all types of cuisine: Chinese, Italian, American, BBQ, and Mexican.  I'm not saying that it's the best quality stuff here, but if you need good value for money this is the spot.  Especially if you're quite indecisive about what you want to eat.
3 If the Fiesta and Red Rock had a child, Boulder station would be that child. Casino aside, wanted to check out the buffet here for lunch. The food was slightly more salty for my tastes (kung-pao chicken). I'm a large fan of pizza but each different piece was lacking in terms of taste. I did enjoy some dishes I never seen at any other Station casino (egg foo young, pork chops with saurkraut). They even had little M&M cookies which reminded me of childhood. Service and decorum was great. For a place that's out of the way I'm more of a fan for the Texas Station.
4 First off, the price is excellent.  It is $5.99 for breakfast (used to be $4.99 a year or two ago), and from 11-4 it is $7.99 a person with drinks included (except alcohol).  The buffet is very large but it is usually very crowded and you have to anticipate a thirty minute line for food frequently.  However, the service is usually excellent (only about 10-15% of the time has it been below par) and the variety of food is tremendous.  If you can't find something you like here, you are simply too picky to eat out.  They have all the traditional breakfast foods for breakfast (eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, pancakes, waffles, toast, cereal, & donuts).  After 11 a.m., they have a good variety of different foods, including a large salad bar and dessert area.  They have a small pasta station and Italian area.  They have a large Chinese, American, & Mexican section and plenty of meat options, although I'm not much of a meat eater, so maybe it might be a little skimpy for a more carnivorous eater.  Always save room for dessert, as part of the fun of a buffet is getting at least one small dessert.  The bottom line is I always enjoy coming here and you simply can't beat the price of this buffet in Las Vegas.  The only reason it doesn't get five stars is because of the long line to get in.
