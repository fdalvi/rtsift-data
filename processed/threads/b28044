4 Stocking all things for outdoorsy types Nevisport is home to good quality camping/sporting and other outdoor gear. I used to go camping with my family when I was younger and I haven't done it in years so when I stumble by such outdoor shops I feel like I am missing out and need to get back into my nature loving ways.  I always chuckle when I see the Berghaus jackets that remind me of Chewing The Fat, why on earth when these jackets are so expensive are they a trademark of neds? It's a strange one. They are good quality jackets, none the less.  The staff in here are knowledgeable so if you're looking for advice on what gear is best to buy, you're in good hands here.
4 Once again, Rose Street comes up trumps with another great find.  Nevisport is an oudoor gear shop along the lines of Blacks or Millets, stocking everything you'd need for a camping trip or festival.  I went in to have a look at some of their hats for a trip to Africa I'll be doing in October.  They have stock on two levels, and the range is pretty good.  Prices aren't cheap for some of the jackets, but you know you'll be buying a good quality product.  Like Stephanie, I think the staff eyed me with a look that said 'you're not an outdoor type, are you', and they would be entirely correct.  But when needs must, I would happily return to Nevisport.
