5 With approximately 3.5 miles of trails to walk, run, and/or bike, the Pheasant Branch Conservancy is a gem in the Madison area. The main loop passes through woods and prairie, past some neighborhoods, and is a mixture of wood planks, gravel, and dirt. Gravel/dirt offshoots go into the marshy areas, up some hills, and generally add to the outdoor enjoyment one can get from spending time in the Conservancy. With an abundance of wildlife, the Conservancy is also a prime bird watching destination (http://www.wisconsinbirds.org/trail/sites/PheasantBranch.htm). There's even a playground, some soccer pitches, tennis courts, and a shelter with water fountains and soda machines one one side of the Conservancy.
5 Awesome trails.  Love all of the river crossings.  Many of them have giant stepping stones to get you across the water. While you can start at a variety of areas, I love parking near the Middleton Hills neighborhood so I can get in a run and then have brunch with my friends at Prairie Cafe afterwards. Scenic prairie, woods, rivers, and a couple of spots you'll be in more of the commercial side of town, but I'm good with mixing up the scenery. Still plenty I have to explore yet, maybe when it warms up a couple of degrees!
5 It seems like only a fool would rate this fewer than 5 stars.  Why would you go to a place like this unless you enjoyed nature and outdoor activity? The trails are open to hikers, runners & bikers, and the atmosphere is sublime.  I'll go again and again to take advantage of pristine nature and well-groomed and well-maintained trails.
