5 I needed to get an emissions test for my car so that I could register it back home. My boyfriend told me to go here since this is where he went.   They have several locations on their website, not all of them have Yelp listings so I would recommend taking a look at it to see if there's one closer to where you live or want to go. You can also see how busy each one is too and the expected wait time.  I went on a Saturday afternoon and there were 3 lanes open with a few cars in each line. The time went by quickly. I was in and out in about 10 minutes and it costed $27.75. Very efficient and a pain free process.
5 The service on this place A+. My stay was in and out. I was probably done in 5 minutes. I can't really complain about it. I came around noon and wasn't so busy. I definitely going to this place for emission next time. Less wait, less hassle.
5 Had $27.75 on hand....was out in less than 5 mins....and left a review on Yelp on top of it!....can't  beat that.  Awesome!
2 Uh. I don't even understand this.  Coming from Nevada where you pull your car up, stay in it, they do the emissions and you're gone, I don't get why this takes 30 minutes. It MUST be state-owned.   I pulled in and there were four lines of about 7 cars each with no rhyme or reason. I pulled into one of them and realized rather quickly that the car in the bay was old. That means that it took much longer to test because it probably wouldn't pass. Finally someone came out and asked me what year my car was and moved me to another line. Finally moving.   I then sat there for another 15 minutes before my car was tested. The people are really nice and efficient, it's the process of getting to them that takes forever. They really need to mark lanes.   Anyway, once I got into the bay it went quickly, like 10 minutes and I was out. Thank goodness that's only once every two years!
