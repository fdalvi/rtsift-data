5 She Bakes is makes some killer desserts!  They are gourmet dessert bakery that uses all-natural ingredients to set their sweets apart from the routine and mundane in flavor.  They have a selection of specialty cookies, cake pops, and seasonal delights on their website, but also do custom orders of all kinds of delicious treats!  My favorite thing about She Bakes is the fact that they make their products with outstanding, high quality ingredients.  Void of fillers and words you can't pronounce, their products are truly are sensational!  I was first introduced to She Bakes via some incredible homemade granola.  (Not your typical intro into a small batch, gourmet dessert establishment)  This tropical granola, fresh, clean tasting, and full of honest flavor left me wanting more.   That was when I realized the commitment to fine ingredients.  Still, I was hesitant to try some of their desserts...after all, the owner looks more like a bikini model than a stereotypical pastry chef...what could she possibly know about a great satisfying dessert?...turns out she know a lot more than most.  Their peanut butter & chocolate chip cookies are some of the best around!  Fully satisfying and wonderfully enjoyable!  I would tell you that her products have an active lifestyle slant due to being made from real food, and lacking unnecessary fillers and junk...but I would be afraid that you might think they would fall into that healthy, but not as enjoyable niche.  That is certainly not the case here.  I brought a few dozen cookies to a party where they were devoured and enjoyed by all.  So...yes they are made by the standards demanded of those with active/food conscious lifestyles...but no your taste buds will not care...in fact they will thank you for the superior taste of high quality, natural ingredients...and yes your waistline will thank you.  On the downside, they do not have a storefront location with the convenience that offers...so you have to do a little advanced planning.  But I think you'll find it worth it.
5 Absolutely amazing sweets and granolas!  I don't typically eat gluten free, so I was a little surprised to find these treats extremely tasty.  One of my favorites right now is the gluten free protein granola.  I wake up craving this stuff!  Its delicious, all natural, and doesn't have that gross protein powder taste.    Everything is made fresh to order and includes free shipping.  What more could you want?
5 Everything Ive tasted from SheBakes is absolutely delicious! Regardless of my gluten sensitivity, I've found Allison's ingredients to be fresh, of the highest quality and thoughtfully combined. I'm really excited about all of her protein-rich products she's begun to sell.  I highly recommend SheBakes treats for everything from personal enjoyment to office parties, birthday parties as well as large private events. I've worked with her on a large order and her ability to accommodate was excellent. She also takes requests for special orders if its big enough.   The best!!
5 I met the owner of She Bakes at the gym of all places.  She brought in some cookies: oatmeal raisin and gluten-free peanut butter and chocolate. Allison is passionate about her products which caused me to drive to Sambalatte who carries her products.  First of all, I don't like store-bought, pre-packaged, additive/artificial stuff in my cookies. I want freshly-baked only.  The ingredients she uses are all natural and I love knowing that there is love put in to every cookie.  My favorite so far is the gluten-free peanut butter and chocolate.  I don't even like peanut butter.  It has dark chocolate chunks. Yuuuummm!!!  I want Hello Kitty cake pops next time.  Since these are made with natural ingredients, consider the shelf-life before hoarding cookies.  It's $15/dozen cookies but quality ingredients aren't cheap.  This is not-so-junk food.
5 After a Sunday Yoga sesh with the Yoga Master David V., we met Alison Hakan, owner of She Bakes, a small operation bakery which specializes in gluten free and vegan sweets and snacks.  She was nice enough to have cookies for us to try, and WOW! I've never tried a gluten-free peanut butter cookie that was this good! With a pastry background from Le Cordon Bleu, and a passion for using the best natural ingredients available, Alison's products are not your typical healthy made, not-so-good tasting cookies. The bag of Gluten-Free Peanut Butter Cookies was gone in seconds!  Bummer that there is no storefront(yet) but you can find She Bakes items at Sambalatte in Summerlin. For those of you who are trying to live a healthier lifestyle, or are seeking very tasty gluten-free/vegan baked goods and sweets, give She Bakes a try. You won't be disappointed!   ALOHA!!!
5 Oh My Goodness, I can't even tell you how amazing She Bakes is, and how great owner Allison is to work with!  She Bakes has everything from delicious decadent cake pops to uber healthy gluten free/vegan/protein filled treats.  Now I'm normally not one for trying to health-ify my treats, but you would never even know that you're getting something good for you!! Ally is open to working with you to fine tune any ingredients to meet your lifestyle, and get this, drops them off to you.  A+ quality and A+ service!
