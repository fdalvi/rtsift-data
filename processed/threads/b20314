5 Relaxing, well thought out greenspace. Various different areas, each with its own character. You can be busy with other people or find a secluded shelter for some peace and quiet. watch out for the kamikaze squirrels though! Wonderful glasshouse, but with an entry fee. Cafe a bit expensive so bring a lunch. Some nice events take place here so watch out for those.
4 I am not especially interested in plants and stuff but the Botanical Gardens in Edinburgh are stunning.  If you are in Edinburgh to visit the castle and the dungeons and all that jazz and you happen to get a nice sunny day then it is definitely worth tweeking your plans to enjoy the gardens. I've spend hours wondering round them and it can't help but calm you after the hustle and bustle of Scotland's capital city.   You can walk here from the city centre but I wouldn't recommend it or you'll be knackered and not feel like wondering around the gardens once you get there! There are a multitude of buses that head up to the gardens and you'll never have to wait long for one.   As a previous reviewer mentioned the café and restaurant in here isn't that fantastic but it does the trick, however I think the next time I visit I'll be bringing a little picnic along with me.
4 The Royal Botanical Gardens are great for a free day out in the sun. The Gardens are huge and there is lots to see. The fact that it is free makes it far more appealing.  I love the greenhouse and like to pretend I am in the jungle when walking through. There is a huge pond full of ducks and other duck like birds floating around which is nice to sit and watch. There is a rock garden, Chinese garden, herb garden and lots of random parts where you don't really know what is going on. Its hard not to appreciate the sheer beauty of all the gorgeous plants and flowers, and the fact you are in the middle of a city makes it even more spectacular.   I used to live near here and we would occasionally go for a walk here in the winter. A lot quieter but still very beautiful with all the frost and snow. Great for a day out with the kids or just for a relaxing walk. Take a picnic though because the cafe is overpriced and disappointing.
5 There is something special about being able to step into a building from a busy, bustling and noisy city center - and be transported to a quiet, alive and organic rainforest of plants, trees and flowers.  The Royal Botanic Garden is one such way that you can experience this feeling - the gardens, located in the city center are huge, spread out across a massive piece of land, and both indoors in a huge green house, and out in the gardens outside. The Garden is particularly pleasent in the summer, where the sun shines, the flowers bloom and generally you will feel one with nature. There is nothing better than spending a lazy day here, just wandering about admiring the plants and watching the world go by.
5 I have mentioned in previous reviews than I am very green fingered indeed, I just love foliage, so Royal Botanic Gardens was always going to be a winner in my book.   Established in 1670 the Royal Botanic Gardens is very lush indeed and up there with the finest display of shrubbery in the world. Picture perfect on a summer's day when all the flowers are in bloom.   It is absolutely free to enter and did you know that the largest palm tree in any greenhouse in Britain is housed right here? That was your useless fact of the day.   In addition to this there's also the famous rock garden and an award winning collection of rhododendrons.
4 Yeah it;s lovely here. Yeah it's idyillic. But I used to come here every other week with my boyfriend, who cheated on me (scumbag), so I don't like these gardens so much.  I know it's not their fault, but it's full of memories for me. But I suppose that's a testament to how brilliant the Botanic Gardens are  - they are really lovely and you can easily spend a whole day in here.  I hope I can take my next boyfriend here and make new memories, because I don't want to lose the gardens!
4 You get two types of public gardens - landscaped garden focusing on general shape and form and spectacular floral displays.  This particular garden is more the former than the latter - more Capability Brown than Alan Titchmarsh.  The paths offer easy access round the gardens, but if you really want to enjoy them let the things that catch your eye guide you not the path set out for you.  Upon leaving the main paths everything gets a bit more tranquil and you can be a bit more alone with your thoughts and a part of the garden around you.  These gardens are designed to draw you in and only once you are within them and surrounded by them can you truly appreciate them.  In addition, there are some fabulous secluded spots, some with hidden away benches, off the main path.  It's free to get into the park so well worth a visit and on entry a map can be bought for 50p.  Points of interest include the Herbaceous Border, Rock Garden and the Pond.  That said, don't just head straight for these, just go in the general direction else you won't take it all in.  The greenhouses are also on offer and you will have to pay to get in - personally I don't think its worth it, but if you're interested it may be worth a peek.    In general the base opening hours are 10am till 4pm through the week, but longer in summer (closes at 7pm at peak of summer - check website for when it is open for longer).
4 An Edinburgh institution, the botanic gardens, or "Royal Botanic Garden" to put it properly, are a well preserved and conserved area of greenery and natural joy for the people of Edinburgh to appreciate plants, bushes, shrubbery, foliage, flowers and just natural life in general.   Although Edinburgh is fairly small as cities go, it's still got all the traffic ridden, congested, busy features that city centres have, so it's pretty amazing that you can stroll into this world of glorious nature in no time from the centre of town.   If you just want a bit of chill time, or a quiet walk and a banter with a friend, or you feel like you want to up your nature knowledge and have a peek round at what the earth can actually manage to grow, definitely get yourself down here.
5 As a lover of rich vegetation, a lover of ponds, and a lover of swans, there's only ever going to be one result in my review for The Botanic Gardens. It's a wonderful way to spend a sunny day, and far more civilised and tranquil than the cider-swilling meadows.  At a B&B in Oban I once saw some prizewinning rhododendrons, and the bad boys on show in here are the first I've seen that could compete with the finest the rural West Coast has to offer. So full of wonderful purple colour they actually stain the surrounding leaves.  Now that's proper horticulture for you.
4 This is one of Edinburgh's crown jewels.  Open for a very long time, Edinburgh's Botanic Gardens are a tranquil oasis from the hustle and bustle of the city.  As Robert says, this place is more Capability Brown than Alan Titchmarsh.  There are open landscaped spaces, with plenty of trees, themed areas and flower beds dotted around.  There are also a few glass houses which house some tropical species, and one that specialises in carnivorous plants.  There's nothing more satisfying than watching these plants eat insects.  Well, I find it satisfying anyway.  With it's location in New Town, this is a lot more civilised than the ruffians you'll find in the Meadows - you're more likely to see a middle-aged couple in his and hers rainjackets than a gang of students here.  Just brilliant, and truly glorious in the height of summer.
5 The Botanic Gardens are beautiful and a real gem within Edinburgh, it is free entry so you really have got nothing to lose by coming here, no matter what time of the year you go. Obviously the Spring and the Autumn are the best times to go where you can see all the flowers in full bloom or to see the beautiful display the trees put on in September. However, even if you go in the Winter, the greenhouses are kept at really humid conditions allowing all types of plants to prosper as well as giving you somewhere nice and warm to go in the cold months! The gardens are well kept and are very clean and there is a cafe towards the middle of the area if you want to stop for a cup of coffee and a snack. The grounds are also very easy to navigate around due to an abundance of signs and maps.
5 Ah le Royal Botanic Garden... J'ai eu du mal à le trouver, ce qui est un comble quand on sait quelle taille il fait, mais la conduite à gauche, une grande ville que je ne connaissais pas, n'étaient pas là pour m'aider ! Heureusement, JeanJean (mon GPS), lui, il était là !    On arrive à l'entrée, on cherche à connaitre le prix de l'entrée, et là aucune fiche tarifaire, rien ! Un comble ! Alors on va voir à l'accueil, et là, on nous répond le plus simplement du monde que c'est gratuit (mais on peut faire un don, mais nous en parlerons plus tard...) !    Nous voilà donc dans le jardin, et là, notre priorité, aller visiter les serres ! Nous suivons donc les pancartes en longeant les allées, et on était décidé à aller le plus vite possible dans ces serres qu'on voulait tellement voir... et bien on a pas réussi ! Il a fallu qu'on sorte des allées, qu'on se perde entre les bosquets pour aller à la rencontre de tous ces arbres, plantes et fleurs (consciencieusement étiquetés), qu'on s'arrête sur un des nombreux bancs (qui sont tous dédiés à des personnalités locales ou des donateurs)... Une demi heure plus tard... on voit apparaitre un morceau de serre au bout d'une allée !    (Voir photo ci-dessous)     Et quel serre ! Rien que d'aspect avec son fer forgé, elle est imposse !   (Voir photo ci-dessous)     On entre, et en guise de hors d'oeuvre on se retrouve entouré de bananiers, de palmiers, d'orchidée, etc... Alors forcément, ça donne envie de payer la visite ! (oui, là il faut payer, mais pour une serre, cela n'a rien d'étonnant). Photo link: http://lh5.ggpht.com/_NVf8btDYIto/THABhaUXVzI/AAAAAAAABCM/HNq6C8xFdxs/s640/P1030722_r.jpg Nous entrons donc dans la serre suivante, car la première qui sert d'entrée, est ensuite reliés à plusieurs autres serres qui ont chacunes leurs atmosphères, et surtout leur différences et particularité géologique et/ou climatiques.    Vous verrez des fleurs surprenantes : Photo link: http://lh6.ggpht.com/_NVf8btDYIto/THABjgZH_SI/AAAAAAAABCQ/eDrv_FDf0ZM/s800/P1030735_r.jpg Un bassin de Nénuphars géants très impressionnant : Photo link: http://lh3.ggpht.com/_NVf8btDYIto/THABnFeGE5I/AAAAAAAABCY/uFNLC6jWZ4Y/s912/P1030738_r.jpg Des fleurs de Lotus : Photo link: http://lh3.ggpht.com/_NVf8btDYIto/THABu5tneWI/AAAAAAAABCg/QqwF0qzWWiE/s720/P1030747_r.jpg Photo link: http://lh5.ggpht.com/_NVf8btDYIto/THABsntKNuI/AAAAAAAABCc/Lqbf2x6vABw/s800/P1030745_r.jpg Et des arbustes étranges (je n'ai pas trouvé l'étiquette de celui-ci qui me plaisait beaucoup avec toutes ses petites fleurs le long de son tronc) : Photo link: http://lh6.ggpht.com/_NVf8btDYIto/THABzMc5AbI/AAAAAAAABCk/KKlqwGfKqkA/s800/P1030763_r.jpg J'arrête avec les photos, il faut qu'ils vous restent des choses à voir... mais ne vous inquiétez pas, il faut prévoir 2h de visite, donc vous n'avez eux qu'un petit aperçu de ce qu'on peut y voir, je ne vous ai par exemple pas montré les photos des serres tropicale humides, des plantes carnivores, de la serres de zone arides, etc...    Vous l'aurez compris, je n'ai pas été déçu par ces serres !    Nous n'avons bien entendu pas pu résister au reste du parc, nous avons flané ici et là. On s'est perdu, on s'est retrouvé, on a senti je ne sais combien de parfum de fleurs dont il es timpossible de se rappeller tous les noms (pour moi surtout). On a été faire un petit tour dans le potager. On a essayé les jeux de pistes pour enfants (on est grand, mais on a aimé quand même).    Au final, nous avons passé plus de temps dans ce jardin que dans la ville elle même !    Il est incontournable !
5 The Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh is one of the world's oldest, and the second oldest in Britain after Oxford. It is a fabulous place to visit to unwind, and the famous rock garden is sublimely beautiful.    History    Founded originally as a physic garden (to grow medicinal plants) in 1670, it has moved twice; first in 1763 to Leith, and in 1820 to its present location on Inverleith Row. Three additional sites across Scotland have since been added at Benmore (1929), Logan (1969) and Dawyck (1978).    As well as being a major botanic garden with some 15,000 living species, the site at Inverleith Row houses extensive research facilities and a substantial botanical research library, as well as a large herbarium of some 3 million dried specimens.    The garden    The main garden on Inveleith Row  also known as 'the Botanics'  comprises 70 acres of landscaped gardens and an arboretum, a mile north of the city centre. There are three glasshouses open to the public: the original Tropical Palm House, opened in 1834; the beautiful and impressive Temperate Palm House, opened as an extension in 1862, and 70ft (22m) high; and the striking and large modern glasshouse, opened in the 1960s and, at the time, one of the most innovative designs of its type.    Of the gardens, the top attraction is undoubtedly the famous Rock Garden, which grows alpine plants in a hill-top setting with rocks, an extensive network of paths, a waterfall and a stream. It is beautifully landscaped and, with around 5,000 plant species, regarded by many as the best of its type in the world.    Also impressive is the herbaceous border, which is 165m long and is backed by a beech hedge which is made up of 150 individual trees, now over 100 years old. A newer addition was the Chinese Hillside, created in 1993 and opened formally by Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997. Its collection of 16,000 indigenous Chinese plants is the largest outside China. Finally, reflecting its location, there is a Scottish Heath Garden with a wide range of heathers in a naturalistic setting.    The site also includes a small privately operated art gallery (in Inverleith House).    Practicalities    Entrance is free to the gardens: there is a charge for the glasshouses.    There are entrances on Inverleith Row (East Gate) and Arboretum Row (West Gate). The main public buildings are now contained in the new John Hope Gateway centre by the West Gate. This includes areas for displays and exhibitions, an excellent botanical shop and plant sales area, toilets, a restaurant and information centre.    There is a coffee bar at the East Gate and the Terrace café in the centre of the gardens, which provides excellent views.    Buses 8, 23 and 27 stop close to the East Gate on Inverleith Row. Car parking is limited to metered on-street parking around the site, but there are dedicated disabled parking bays at the John Hope Gateway (West Gate) on Arboretum Place.    All buildings and major areas of the Garden are accessible to wheelchairs. Wheelchairs are available for loan at the Garden entrances and a self-driven electric cart is available by prior appointment. Both the John Hope Gateway and Terrace Café have disabled toilets.    Dogs are not allowed, except for Guide Dogs.
5 I love this place for the pigeons and squirrels, they are friendly and love getting fed, many will pose for photos and eat from your hand
5 The Botanic Garden in Edinburgh is about as close to heaven as it's possible to get in the city.  Outstandingly beautiful and peaceful with an attractive array of wildlife, including some very friendly squirrels who will eat out of your hand if you're patient enough - though be warned they will bite if they feel threatened.  There is a restaurant on the grounds which is ridiculously overpriced and a not inexpensive shop, but the shop is good for souvenirs and if you take a picnic with you there are plenty of places you can enjoy it.  The arboretum is spectacular, though not cheap, but you don't need to visit it to enjoy the gardens and entrance is free.  My favourite part has to be the Chinese garden with its bamboo and waterfalls, though there are plenty of nooks and crannies to explore and you can easily spend an entire day out there.  Not to be missed.
5 This place was absolutely incredible.  I visited in late March, but it seems to be the kind of place that has a different style of beauty at different points.  I'll talk about my two favorite parts: the greenhouse gardens and the general gardens (specifically the 'rock hill garden')  Walking into each greenhouse was like discovering a whole new world.  Ranging from tropical rooms covered in brilliant flowers and lush vines to a desert room with cactus.  My only regret is that I wasn't able to run around and frolic among the plants like a little kid.  I have to say my favorite greenhouses were probably 8 and 10.  8 had a ton of carnivorous plants and orchids (which are awesome) and 10 had an Amorphophallus Titanum, a plant that grows an absolutely gigantic flower. Unfortunately it is in the beginning stages of this years growth, but that's just an incentive to come back :)  The rock hill garden was both visually stunning and a great place for children to play.  While I was there, a wedding was being held and children were running around having a wild time.  If you have kids, take them here, they will love it.  From the top of the hill, you can see the Edinburgh skyline, complete with castle.   Trust me its worth seeing.
5 Bit too many rhododendrons for me.   But - am I going to knock a star off what is a lovely tranquil space to spend a day? Not I, said the fly. I haven't visited RBGE since I was kneehigh to a lawnmower, when we went to the glasshouses to learn about the rainforest and the threat to it's existence (how times have changed, eh? eh?) and tried dried mango for the first time. Roll on twenty-something years, and it's taken into our heads to revisit. And it really hasn't changed in any way. It's still beautiful, although I swear it was all indoors the last time I visited! Honest! For the tourist wanting to do something not directly on the main drag, or the local wanting somewhere pleasant to picnic in the town, you can't really go wrong.   Enjoy.
5 I really can't top Catriona C's opening line of her review below. Says it all really.  But despite the excess of rhododendrons (I'm glad she knows how to spell it, I got lost around the 'dod' part) it really is a stunning green space in the city.  I grew up in the countryside, surrounded by orchards with fruit trees, fresh fruit and veg grown in our back garden, and listening to the sound of cooing wood pigeons on a hazy summer evening as the last embers of the BBQ were dying. I'm getting nostalgic here. Basically, I have an affinity with a green space but one that isn't necessarily a wood, meadow or unkempt. Our garden was a Victorian one, complete with Walled Garden, and the Royal Botanic Garden's is this on a much, much larger scale (well we weren't going to rival Queen Liz eh?) So I feel completely at home here.  And my what a space it is. Huge really. It's easy to get lost in, despite the signs (and they are handy). I still haven't navigated it properly in my head. But it's like Disney-land for those with green fingers. A Chinese Garden, stunning glass greenhouses with their own sections of tropical and rainforest plants, different houses for different flowers. And the open grass spaces are plentiful. I found a wee hidden small square near the house and café at the top of the hill which I peacefully fell asleep in for a few hours last weekend.  There are also lots of events always taking place, and the staff here seem to do a very good job of them.  If you're a local and haven't been, go. Seriously, whilst the weather is nice, it's such a waste not to. And if you're visiting the city, this should be on your agenda as a piece of history, of architecture, of green space and of a square of Edinburgh not to be missed.
3 What a great break from the bustle of touring Edinburgh.    Rhododendrons are the thing at the Botanic, and they were in full flower when we visited in mid-April.  Apparently the rhodies have some sort of blight and the Botanic is taking steps to deal with it, but some of them look a bit bedraggled.  The coffee shop provided a needed shot of mid-afternoon caffeine.
5 I adore the Botanic Gardens and feel lucky to live within a short walking distance of them.   One of my favourite memories is listening to Trespassers William play an acoustic set in the Victorian glasshouse. Under a canopy of palm leaves and to the beat of rain drumming on the glass ceiling, the setting for their music was majestic.  http://offthebeatentracks.tv/2009/episode-21-trespassers-william/
4 Everything about my visit to the Botanic Gardens should lead to negative review. We walked all the way from our hotel on High St, which was tiring. It was pouring rain. And I hate nature and hiking.  Even with all of these factors, I enjoyed the Gardens. It's really the perfect place for meandering. Not quite normal walking, definitely not hiking, somewhat similar to strolling - an unhurried, unguided meander is how you want to experience the Royal Botanic Garden.   As one meanders one can see everything from a perfectly manicured Queens Garden to the overgrown Chinese Hillside. There are greenhouses with tropical flora and exhibits about sustainability. These areas are all separated by rolling grounds and lovely trees, so each new garden feels more like a discovery and less like an item on a checklist.
5 Splendid!  Just an extremely well-tended and well-curated garden that you can spend several hours wending through, and for free.  The glass houses are not free but are worth the extra poundage--each little ecosystem is almost magical in its transformation from the immediate outside surroundings.  Can't believe it's taken so many visits to Edinburgh to finally visit here--this is an excellent counterbalance to all that history and architecture, especially as many of the other EDI parks are either 1. private 2. filled with scary drunks or 3. on a big hill that is difficult to scale when pregnant.
5 This place is HUGE and gorgeous and educational and refreshing. Wow, I'm so glad my husband and I had an amazing sunny and warm day to visit this spot during our honeymoon in late September. Really, the weather couldn't have been more perfect.  We witnessed some spectacular flowers and plants that we'd never seen in America and took such a relaxing stroll through the gardens. There were so many young parents with babies relaxing on the lawns. We came in the main entrance and left on the complete opposite side.  TIP: Free restrooms!  I also got to hug a giant tree. :)
5 The enormous, meticulously-tended grounds of the Botanic Gardens are only a small part of this 350-year-old scientific institution's operations. The Edinburgh location is only one of four, with laboratories and specimen collections (nearly 15,000 different species from all over the world, or about 5% of all known plant species, including 500 different Rhododendrons!) and an active research community. While these facilities are not accessible to the public, there is an overwhelming array of activities to join in on (just see on of their several free guidebooks), such as their educational programs (PHd programmes in taxonomy, botanical illustration, horticulture, ethnobotany, herbal medicine, even pilates and meditation), cultural events, lectures, music, the multiple cafés, restaurant, and the lovely Inverleith House art gallery at the top of the hill. I've come several times, and in one instance was satisfied to venture only 20 meters inside for a picnic with friends. It is the perfect place to take visiting relatives or people with children. In my opinion it is on par with Author's Seat as an Edinburgh destination. If the sun is shining, don't miss it.
4 These botanical gardens are huge! We were only there for a short spell and visited only a portion of the park but from what we could see it looked quite magnificent. The sheer size is noteworthy and I'm sure there are many wee areas to discover.  We went to the duck pond and found it to be thoroughly exciting. My wee one just loved running around.
5 On a sunny day could the Botanic garden is one of those 'places to be'. I haven't actually been in a couple of years, but being in the area on a glorious day, I knew it was time.  We entered through the West gate, which prepares you for your visit with loos, a restaurant, a gift/garden shop and a small information centre. Upon exiting this little centre, you arrive in the gardens. Entrance is free, though you pay to enter the greenhouses. I haven't been inside...  At this time of year the garden is alive with flowers, though the leaves don't seem to  be appearing on the trees yet... There were plenty of families around having picnics and following the garden trail.  This is a really good place to breathe some fresh air and pretend you are in the countryside. It is identify species, thanks to the numerous signs providing common and scientific names.  My favourite areas are:  The rocky garden: This feels the most planned, the most ornamental, but it is very cute and idyllic with waterfalls, rocky pathways and little bridges.  The Chinese hill: Bamboo, a mini Chinese style pavillion, a pond and tranquil paths.   The pond: A waterfall runs into a large pond, home to ducks and various aquatic plants.
5 Oh it really is one of my favourite places to be on a sunny day, an autumn day even a snowy day but maybe not a rainy day ;) Such a serene and freeing place to be.  I always seem to discover somewhere new every time I visit the the Royal Botanics. It's now a staple of my tour when friends and family stay over.   The shop here is quaint as are the cafe and restaurant. Now and again a few friends and I can be caught enjoying a glass or two of wine on the terrace by the West gate :)   It's totally suitable for anyone of any age and taste.
5 Gradens are large to keep you occupied... but not too big, and can be visited in an afternoon.   Best of all, the attraction is free, although it is worth paying for if there was a fee.  We walked in, walked around... had lunch at the restaurant (food was really good - especially the fish and chips).  Rock garden is great, as well as the lawn area, and the overall landscaping.  The center of the park has some great views of the city.  A must if you are in Edinburgh.
5 Avec un ami, nous y avons passé une journée de rêve. Le terrain est parfaitement entretenu et il fut très agréable de s'y promener, au travers des différents jardins.
5 I have liked the Botanics since the first time I visited, in the pouring rain with my Mum. As visits to places go, I have to admit it wasn't a particularly successful one, what with   us being too late for afternoon tea at the Gateway and the pouring rain, however we still had a lovely time.   There are lots of different things to see here, I think I notice something new every time I visit. Different kinds of plants and gardens and an amazing view. I have to say I am not a garden fanatic as my parents are, but I do enjoy spending time here.  Recently I took my class on a school trip here and they loved it. I found it a fantastic experience seeing the place through their eyes. I think this is definitely a place for all ages.   If you haven't been, I would say definitely go.
4 I've lived in Edinburgh for 8 years and shamefully had never before been to the Botanics. But on a gloriously sunny long weekend my boyfriend and I headed down for a wander. Now, in my head it would be more like Glasgow's Botanics and we'd find a spot to sit and read - but it didn't feel quite right doing that here so instead we did a full circuit, admiring the beautiful botany and fabulous flowers. I was really pleasantly surprised by how lovely it all is (especially in the sun).  Feeling a bit hungry we stopped by one of the cafes for a coffee and a cake and yep, it was on the more expensive side for what you got. Plus, chocolate melts...  We missed out on the various greenhouses, as you have to pay to get in (and it's not especially cheap, from memory entrance was about a fiver), but otherwise had a great time - no doubt helped by the weather!
5 Beautiful gardens and a perfect day out of a sunny day. I love coming here with a good book, sprawling out on the grass and getting stuck in to a story.   A must visit is the glasshouse - worth the small cost of entry without a doubt.   The Botanics are an Edinburgh institution; long may the stunning gardens continue to delight the city's people.
5 I love this place, and I don't go enough! It's just on that other side of the city from me, that isn't really far at all, but feels like it to me. It's a really lovely place to go for a walk, and to bring visitors to. When I did support work this was a great place to bring the service users, as it's so spacious and relaxing, with lots of beautiful plants and trees, and many squirrels.   There are good facilities here with a cafe on one side of the Botanics and a restaurant on the other, with a shop, exhibition area, and toilets. The Botanics seems to be a popular place for weddings too and I've seen lots of well dressed people wandering through.  Writing this makes me want to go there again soon!
5 If you looking for a break away from the hectic buzz of the city, take a short stroll down to the Botanics, you won't be disappointed.  It's a very peaceful, relaxing and beautiful place.    I regularly visited the Botties when I was an art student, drawing the flora and fauna in the humid greenhouses.  Last year I attended my friends wedding here, a perfect venue for it.  More recently I went for the star gazing night event.  Attended to a lecture and looked at the stars and moon through their telescopes.  Fascinating!  They have lots of events here, check out the website for workshops, talks and walks they arrange.  But do go for an easy wonder through, take a picnic along, get lost in nature and enjoy.
5 Esto sí que es un jardín botánico como Dios manda, y los demás - muchos otros "botánicos" - son tonterías (sin mencionar nombres).  Hectáreas y hectáreas con diferentes "mundos" florales y temáticos, con las plantas agrupadas según zonas climáticas... una rocalla con 5.000 plantas alpinas, la recreación de una ladera china, con plantas típicas y descripciones de cada paisaje.... una maravilla!   Y lo mejor de todo:  El acceso es gratis... lo que hace de este botánico un parque más en la ciudad, para pasear un ratito cuando estás cerca o para estar horas y horas descubriendo las 13.000 especies diferentes que hay. Y si no hay que pagar, invita aún más a entrar varias veces, en diferentes épocas del año, etc.   Además, con tantas cosas que hay que ver, sí que hay que volver varias veces... seguro que cada vez te sorprenderá más!  Para los invernaderos con palmeras, plantas exóticas, helechos, etc., sí que hay que pagar entrada (y yo digo "menos mal", para que haya más fondos para preservar esta institución).  También es genial para ir con niños y explicarles el mundo de las plantas, una cosa que cada vez se pierde más. Como las diferentes zonas del jardín están tan bien explicadas y organizadas de forma didáctica, estoy segura de que también los niños urbanos de la generación 4G se divierten un montón.
5 Le Royal Botanic Garden, c'est un peu un passage obligatoire lors d'une visite à Edimbourg. Le jardin est immense et tellement beau ! Essayez, bien sûr, de vous y rendre un jour où il ne pleut pas, mais sachez qu'en cas d'averse vous pourrez vous abriter puisqu'il y a de nombreuses serres toutes plus belles les unes que les autres à visiter. Attention au changement de température parfois difficile à supporter quand vous entrez dans la serre tropicale ! :)  L'entrée du jardin est gratuite mais l'accès à certaines serres est payant. Ceci dit, le prix est vraiment correct pour toutes les jolies plantes que vous pourrez y voir !   Pensez à venir avec des cacahuètes, vous pourrez approcher les écureuils comme jamais vous ne l'avez fait auparavant. Ils viennent se nourrir dans vos mains sans crainte. Avec un peu de chance, vous croiserez même un renard (qu'on peut aussi voir en ville parfois, si si).  Ce lieu est tellement reposant, difficile de croire qu'il se trouve en ville.
4 If you're looking for a free, child friendly and central activity on a sunny day in Edinburgh the Botanics are a great option.   The grounds are very well kept, with lots of beautifully designed little areas, all hosting a wonderful selection of flowers. There are greenhouses (at least one of which is free to enter) alongside water features, pagodas, rock gardens and ponds.  The most lovely aspect of the Botanical Gardens is how child friendly it is. Everywhere you go there are children running around, playing, learning and just having a brilliant time. The space is vast and safe, so parents can let their little ones run loose with comfort.   Despite the masses of happy and excited children there are also plenty of quite spaces to sit and relax. I can imagine an author going to one of the magnificent benches to write, or a student to study, for example, so the space is very varied in that sense.   The best part of it all is that it doesn't cost you a penny and, unlike many free attractions, the whole place is kept to a really high standard.   Definitely worth a visit! Handy tip- they do host weddings here as well, so if you're looking for a beautiful spot, go and check it out!
5 I love the Botanics.  The Man and I used to come here for a stroll when we lived in the neighborhood and didn't have a garden - it's quiet and green with plenty of benches for relaxing, and as it's not the kind of place where you can bring a disposable BBQ, you're also not going to have to contend with drunk students.  Lately I come here to have a poke around the edible garden and get some inspiration. Their polytunnel is fantastic, and they have several veggie patches that are maintained by groups of school kids.  As a gardener it really is fabulous to have so many different gardening techniques in use in one place so I can get an idea for what is best for our space.
5 The sun was out and so were the seasonal blooms!  A stone throw away from the city, this is central park of Edinburgh but oh so much more sophistacated!!  I love coming down here for some gardening inspiration.  A bonus if I have my big camera too!  This is not my first visit and it certainly won't be my last!
4 I'd never been to the Edinburgh Botanics before but figured they would be a good spot to enjoy the nice weather and get some good photos.   We opted to walk it from the train station which, with the help of good old google maps wasn't too bad, although we would have been quicker if we hadn't stopped to take photos enroute.   The gardens themselves are a fair size with several nice areas including a terrace cafe and walled garden. Access is free although its £5 to enter the glasshouses which was well worth it for us as we spent several hours snapping some unusual plants and flowers. A word of warning though the glasshouses are hot and humid as the climate reflects the plants natural environment.   Definitely a nice spot for a wander and some photos on a summer day!
