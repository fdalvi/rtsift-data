5 Mickey is a licensed esthetician with 4+ years of experience doing eyebrow threading. Other services include full facial threading, waxing and henna.
5 I was on a search to find someone who can thread my eyebrows around my area.  I was always going to Eyebrows R Us close to the Rainbow and 215 area and that was just too far.  So I found Mickey on a google search and it was perfect because she's located inside the Beauty Center store on Charleston and Town Center next to Albertson's.  I called her and asked if I could come in to get my eyebrows threaded and when I got there, she took me in right away to her station and got it done!    Mickey is really good and quick.  You know you're going to someone good when they don't need tweezers to pluck the hairs that they missed!  And she shapes them perfectly!  I'm not sure if you need an appointment or not but I always just call ahead of time to make sure she's available.  I won't go to anyone else to do my threading.  Eyebrows and upper lip costs $13 for both, which is cheaper than the other places.
5 Mickey is an awesome threader!!! If you are looking for someone who will listen to what you want and how you would like to get it done then you should see Mickey. She does great eyebrows! She will totally calm you down if it is your first time and you are nervous. Love her!!
