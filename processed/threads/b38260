5 I've been seeing Fred as my hairstylist for 12 years, and even though I've moved away from Phoenix, I still visit him whenever I'm back in town. For as long as I've known him, he has been equal parts DJ and hairstylist, and incredibly talented at both. When I began planning my wedding, I naturally turned to Fred. My hair looked beautiful, as expected, and it was a great convenience to have him there as the DJ too!  At first I wasn't sure if I was cool enough to have Fred there as our wedding DJ, since I knew he worked a lot in clubs, but he has been doing weddings for a long time now and he has clearly learned from the best and added his own spin to it. He gave us a very comprehensive list to get us thinking about our music, including the songs we didn't want him to play, and walked us through our choices in advance. He worked our requests into his mix while still making sure he created a comprehensive and appropriate playlist for the ceremony and reception. He didn't limit us in any way, instead getting any music we asked for that he didn't have. And he was inspired by our choices to pick other music that was just perfect.   In addition to putting together some great music, Fred was actively involved in keeping the event timeline on track. He coordinated with the caterers, personally came to tables to dismiss people to the buffet, and was generally very involved in a polite and friendly way. We received so many wonderful compliments from our guests about the music and his professionalism. And as if that wasn't enough, I also got a lot of great compliments about my hair! Fred is the best, and I'm so glad he was part of our event.
5 Fred is really great with color and cut. After moving into the area, I was going through hairdressers searching for a great colorist and a more updated look. Fred came through with flying colors! I no longer have to keep looking, and you know what a pain it is to find a great hairdresser.
