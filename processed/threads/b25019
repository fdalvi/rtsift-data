4 This place is alot better than the one near my home. Service is a lot better, food is hot and the crew seems a lot more friendly!
1 Unfortunately there are not many late night fast food places open 24hrs in Surprise.  Avoid this Jack in the Box even though they are 24hrs.  The night employees are rude and slow.  Even had them lie and tell me their system is down.  Even offered to pay cash but they told me they couldn't do anything.  They need a computer to make a burger??
1 If you are super high and it's 2am this is your spot, otherwise, avoid it as there are much better options all around it including Rubios, 5 guys, chic-fil-a, and pizza.
3 Not the fastest JIB I've ever been to, or the cleanest.
3 Got my order wrong two times in a row.. Still had good customer service but lousy attention to detail
