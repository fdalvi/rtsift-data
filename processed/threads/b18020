5 I was in Las Vegas. I was also looking for a Wii. I started seeing people walk by with Wii's. My radar turned on and suddenly we were on a mission. We got to the Game Stop and I asked if they had any Wii's. THEY DID! They got in a shipment the night before. Awesome! We bought it! I'm happy now. Thank you Soerha!
4 My brother forgot a cable for our week visit to Vegas for our Xbox and this Gamestop saved our lives having exactly what I needed at a great price.
1 Don't expect quality.  The mall is nice overall but the staff at this Gamestop was a big disappointment.  One female employee was on the phone the entire time I was in the store (roughly 20 min) while the other employee was attempting to fix his personal IPad at work. Neither caring about what was going on in the store and not paying attention to customers waiting to check out.
