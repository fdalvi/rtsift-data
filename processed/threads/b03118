5 I recently used A & J Graphics and Promotions for the Arizona Centennial Conference program.  Not only was the project done in time and under budget, the end product was beautiful and the customer service was amazing.  I would highly recommend this company to anyone needing any type of promotional product.
5 Our non-profit organization solicited four bids for our full-color brochures when we needed to re-order. We were very satisfied with a previous order A&J Graphics had printed, and were happy that his bid again came in lower than the other three. The quality couldn't be better: vivid color, sharp impressions, neat folds. The work was done quickly, delivered to my door, and carefully packaged. I will recommend A&J to anyone looking for an excellent printer at a fair price.
5 I used A & J Graphics & Promotions again for my new business cards. They knocked it out of the park again!  The cards look fabulous and the price was right.  Awesome customer service, too.  I highly recommend them.
