5 I've never written on yelp about any service, however, I truly feel compelled to do so after my experience.  Charles listened to what I was wanting to achieve with my look and delivered natural looking enhancements. He took his time to ensure everything was perfect! Plus, his positive attitude and professionalism can not be overstated. I am completely happy with the results and will continue to go to Charles in the future!
5 I have only wonderful things to say about Charles at Glo Medspa!  My consultation was both professional and thorough. Charles demeanor is very calming and he patiently answered all of my questions and uses a very gentle technique, as the Botox injections were virtually painless! My results are great, and I plan to continue scheduling my future skin treatments with Charles.
