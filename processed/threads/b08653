5 If you or someone you know is looking for a school for Pre-k through 8th grades, this is it! The teachers here are PRESENT. They care deeply about the kids and the Montessori way of learning. Maria Montessori would be proud!
5 Amazing school!  We started our boy here at 18 months and almost immediately he was putting multiple words together, drinking out of a cup, sitting politely to eat, and countless other things that we had no idea he was ready to learn.  The staff and teachers are fantastic and we could tell genuinely love the kids, and would strategically pair the children up with kids who they could learn from.  There has never been a day when I feel bad leaving him, most days he is so excited to get to school he runs in, and almost every day he comes home talking about his friends by name.  We are so glad a friend recommended this school to us, and I still can't believe the progress he has made in just 6 months.
1 My 6 year old child was bullied on the campus and they told me it was the childs fault for not reporting it.  The child is 6 years old!  I have started teaching the child martial arts, if it happens again the offending child will be very sorry.  Stay away for this school it is not safe for children.
