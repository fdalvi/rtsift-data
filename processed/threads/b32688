4 My grocery bill is about 1/3 lower than it was when I shopped at Copps. They don't have a huge selection, but for basic groceries they have most things. The prepackaged deli meats are excellent, much of the frozen food is great, and things like bread, milk, and eggs are very low priced and good quality. Everybody I've talked to who works there seems very nice.
4 You know what's cool? $3 wine. You know what else is cool? Progressive grocery stores that have creative incentives like no bags and return-a-cart quarter slots.  This store has both and is all around a pretty fun place.  It's definitely a discount grocery and doesn't offer a wide variety of brands, but that's why everything is so cheap!  Check it out if you get the chance. I normally make it part of my commute home from work at least once a month.
