5 I love RelayRides!  I've been using it now for about 9 months and it is always such a great experience!   I usually only rent cars that will get me where I need to go - nothing fancy pants :)  But if you are in to fancy pants cars, you can probably find one.    This a cheaper alternative to car rental companies that charge an arm and a leg especially at the airport and zipcar where you have to stress out to get the car back on time b/c someone is waiting for it.  You get to meet the owner and the owner gets to meet the driver.  It is more personal.  Everyone I've dealt with has been super nice and accommodating.  Even taking me back to the airport!    I love how this service is available in almost all cities :)  I've now rented in Oakland, Phoenix, and about to rent in Denver.
5 Best way to rent a car by far! Definitely will be using the app again. Had a great first experience.
5 Best way to rent a car! I've used it twice now and the prices I was able to get were at least half as much as any rental agency in the areas. Often, the owner of the car will even offer to pick you up from the airport (for a small fee). I'll be using this service for all my rental needs from here on out.   You can even drive some unique cars that normal rental companies do not offer. BMW, Audi's, offroad jeeps, etc. I've been recommending it to all my friends since finding out about it.
