5 The food at this new cafe was very good and the service was great. Decor is western and very clean. Will go back soon.
4 REALLY enjoyed it! First visit, motorcycle parking outside, GREAT service, friendly waitress, LOVED the spicy potatoes, very reasonably priced. Recommend it!
4 The patty melt with a green chile add on was great.  It's definitely worth the walk from the downtown area to this little spot.
