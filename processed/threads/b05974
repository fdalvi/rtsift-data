5 I left my wallet in the cab after paying on a Saturday night.  There was little I could do because I didn't know what cab company took me home. First thing Monday morning I received a call at work from Union Cab saying they had my wallet including cash and credit cards inside.  It's nice to know there are still some honest people out there.  Thank You!!
4 Was on S. jones street and needed a ride back to the strip. Weren't any cabs so called this company. Wait time quoted was about 15-35 minutes, they came at around 12 minutes. Fast!
1 Never again!!! I called they said waiting time 45minutes I said okay I called again and they said they already sent someone guess what??! 2hrs nobody came I called to cancel and he said oh we just sent someone? Really so why the hell was i waiting for so long if u didn't send anybody? I'm never gonna use their services again... And the customer service is even worst... They don't deserve any stars.
