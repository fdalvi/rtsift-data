2 All in all, a little bit manky but has a decent variety of shops.   There is a big Sainsburys and a more recent addition of a big Asda. They are both nice supermarkets and I have no complaints there. Sandwiched between them in IKEA which is an absolute delight and necessity for Edinburgh.  Further down from Sainsburys there are many more shops and LOTS of terrible potholes in the road. There is a lovely big Next home store, a few bargain stores and a Homebase.  Overall, if you need something, I am sure Straiton will have a shop where you can find it.
1 A bit out of town... Not pedestrian friendly... A big box jungle.
2 Located outside of town going towards Penicuik. For me this shopping area just doesn't strike my fancy. Feels hard to get around the place without always looking to make sure I don't get hit by a car. The stores are also ones I never or wouldn't normally shop at. The best place here I think is the Pet store. You can go in and browse at the fish and bunnies and such.  There's also a Sansburys but I find them to be to expensive as well. Check the place out though before judging it to harshly from Yelp reviews. I just don't care for it to much .
5 The retail park has Improved in the last few years with the addition of McDonald's and Frankie and Benny's it's within walking distance for me and my family and from town the no 37 bus takes you straight there or you can use either the park n ride or the many parking spaces provided.  The new nike shop is great and also there are a variety of other shops only thing would be great if there was a cinema complex or a decent shop that sells DVDs or CDs like hmv or a game shop overall I love it :-)
