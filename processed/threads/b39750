5 Love this place, best gel manicure ever it last for 3 weeks+. People are super friendly, clean nice relaxing looking environment.  They have a loyalty program where you get points so far I have had gel nails done several times, pedicure and eyebrows and I have been happy every time!!
5 Best pedicure I've had in awhile. I love that they have a menu with options so you can actually see what you're paying for.
1 I don't know if it is the quality of the gel polish brands they're using, but I've been getting gel done on my nails for well over 5 years and I've never had a worse experience. The application was sloppy, the blue gel never set right (felt like silicone rather than the usual hard finish). It chipped and peeled the very first day - that's never happened to me before.  I returned the next day and they reapplied with a different brand, this time the pink took two days to chip up. I genuinely felt bad because the nail tech tried so hard, but they clearly have some subpar products.
