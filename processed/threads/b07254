4 My home warranty company sent Runyon's to my home on two separate occasions.  I'm pretty sure I got the same technician too, George.  Both the staff that work the phones and George are friendly and professional.  My washing machine and stove were fixed without much hassle and are still functioning properly.  My only wish with this place (and just about all the other companies like them) is that they would be more accurate with their 4 hour windows.  Anyway, I am happy with the service I received and would definitely use them again.
1 Showed up for a home warranty fix on my washer.  30+ days later, no response.  These guys are a joke.
1 I rescheduled delivery of my washing machine twice .... Once delivered the tech told me I was lucky because they were going to cancel that day and let me know that I would be responsible to pick it up ... What kind of business says that ... I'm so lucky
1 Do not go with this company if you don't have to. They are nearly impossible to get ahold of and you will be put on hold immediately without even being able to say a word if they actually answer the phone. Had to hold for a long time and get hung up on just to call back and hold again and not get anywhere with scheduling them to come out. Someone is always "going to get back to you" and then they don't. Once you actually talk to someone it is hard to get them to commit to a timeframe for when they will come out to look at your appliance.
