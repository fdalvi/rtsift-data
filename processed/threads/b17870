4 I love Ricky's Big Philly, but sometimes I see that they are close. Maybe it's the summer hours. I especially love the Tuna sandwiches. Yum!
2 Here is the thing, the food was mediocre at best. The meat in the cheese steak was to thick and over done along with the mushrooms and onions. I kind of felt like I was eating dog food or a really bad Italian beef. The only good part were the fries and they were just OK. If you want a good cheese steak I suggest you go to Casella's in Scottsdale. I wish I had.
4 After driving by this place countless times, I finally stopped by today. I eat cheesesteaks maybe twice a year, but I do enjoy a good one.  Well, Ricky's delivers a delicious cheesesteak. In fact, If I were using Corleone's as a competitor, Ricky's would leave them in the dust. The meat is good, and they don't overdo it on the cheese. The highlight, however, is the bread - the best cheesteak bread I've had in the Valley. It's not too soft, and not too hard - it's just right and gave me enough of a grip to make this one of the cleanest-eating cheesesteaks I've ever had.
4 I recently visited with my Italian friend, Joe. So when he said that the chicken parm sandwich was as good as anything he's had- particularly the sauce-, that carries weight.  We also sampled the burger and cheesesteak, both great.    Now if they could just work on creating some ambiance.  The place is barren and has the charm of a janitors closet.  But don't let that dissuade you.  The food is splendid, a great lunch option.
