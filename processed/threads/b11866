5 Best ISP in Arizona.  I prefer "Ma and Pa" ISPs.  They treat you the best and they value your business.  Extreme Internet is a shining example of both.  I live in San Francisco and I still use them for a few services.  They are good people.
5 My name is Aaron Gagnon and I own Miss Details Design, a Scottsdale graphic design firm.  I was really nervous about setting up a website and heard that Extreme Internet was a great local ISP.  Well, it is absolutely true. The service and price points are outstanding. Really nice people to work with.    I love giving local companies my business whenever possible.  I highly recommend Extreme Internet.
