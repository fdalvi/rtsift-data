3 This place is where I go whenever I am filling up the tank. It's got some of the cheapest prices in the valley. It has the unfortunate location right next to the 7-11 so you don't really see this place because the sign is small and the place is pretty dimly lit.  They also run a really great special of $5.99 for a 6-pack of coronas.  There's not really a huge selection of snacks & drinks but what they do have is really cheap.   But as bad as it sounds, some times I just don't want to stop there because there is ALWAYS at least on homeless person hanging around the parking lot, and dealing with it EVERY time gets old.
1 It's a dirty location with a foul smell of piss inside. From my short visit it's apparent their main clientele are transient.
