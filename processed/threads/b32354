5 The helicopter ride over the Grand Canyon was spectacular. We landed in the canyon and had a champagne lunch. The pilot was professional and knowledgeable about the area. She made us very relaxed and comfortable.
4 Good times for sure. I'd do it again. The false advertising of one block off the strip beats us down a tad on the walk. The pilots lack of communication was frustrating as well. He said it was due to other helicopters in the area...
5 Sis and I stayed in Vegas over the Memorial Weekend, I'm a total rewards member so I was able to cop a 2 for 1 deal for the Helicopter rides.  I'm a bit confused because the coupon was for Papillion Helicopter but the address was Grand Canyon Helicopters so maybe its one in the same???.  IDK..but we decided to take advantage of the 15min flight over the strip --- you know do something a little different.  We got there early and the lobby had wonderful and comfortable leather chairs and sofas to relax in, the served up champagne which my sis got and the girl forgot about me so we had to remind her of that. After champagne and a brief safety video we were shuttled over to the helicopters.  There were 3 in total and 6 people (not including the pilot) to a helicopter.  No flash cameras and no light on cell phone are allowed but you are more than free to whip out that cell and video tape and or take pics in night mode on your phones.  WONDERFUL experience and I'm glad my sister and I were able to enjoy it together.
