2 Forced into a delivery dinner, Big Wa was the choice, but it ended up being a poor choice. The only good item was the Vegetable Fried Rice, which did contain frozen peas and carrots, but also enough fresh veggies to overcome that issue. The two free egg rolls that came with the order of 20 bucks were run of the mill with the usual orange dipping sauce. Heading downhill from there was the Chicken Noodle soup, featuring overcooked spaghetti noodles and strange pieces of chicken floating around. The poor chicken quality also showed up in a dish that i usually never order - the Moo Shu Chicken. Haven't had this in awhile, but the chicken is usually chopped up and mixed in with the veggies so you can put it in the pancakes. This chicken was the same from the soup, but sliced like it was a normal entree, so that created more of a burrito when you stuffed the pancakes full of items. Either way, the Moo Shu ingregients were inferior and Big Wa is not a top of the line place unless you like rice for dinner in this case.
5 I have eaten at Big Wa twice now & love it! I don't normally eat a lot of Chinese food but, from now on I will be eating it at Big Wa. The portions are a great size for the price & the price is right. My kids were even happy with their food. They did a great job accommodating our large party as well! Great job Big Wa!
5 My husband and I have eaten Chinese food all over Phoenix, and hands down, Big Wa has been the best.  The BBQ pork with fresh spicy mustard is A-Mazing!!  We have ordered about 6 different dishes from here, sometimes totally blind and the food is always great!
4 We used to frequent the Chandler restaurant when it was still in business and were thrilled to find a new one in Tempe.  The food was the same great flavors we loved.  The sauces were great.  The vegetables quite fresh.  The service was very friendly!
4 I don't know why there was a name change or why this place was empty when I visited during prime dinner hours. I can tell you that everything I ate was hot, fresh, appealing, and actually made me want to order another meal to go so I could experience it again at home.  This place should not be passed up.  It will become one of your favorites.   The portions are good value for the money.  The simple things are not laking focus.  My won ton soup was one of the best that i've had in the Valley.  There could be something done about the atmosphere, but if you have a group, this is a great place to bring the team to eat!
4 Eaten there twice now.  The General Chicken was ok.  Round balls fried with sauce.  Sauce was ok but plentiful.  Yesterday I had the Mongolian Beef and it was really really good.  Lots and lots of flavor, well cooked, and not too chewy.
5 I've had my share of Tempe Chinese delivery disappointments which makes this place even more exciting.  My husband and I have been ordering delivery from Big Wa for a few months now.  It is the best Chinese delivery this side of Tempe for sure.  They are quick!  Tonight they warned it would be an hour+ wait for the food and it was here in 45 minutes.  Most nights it only takes 30 minutes or so.  The fried rice comes in huge proportions -- we prefer it with pork.  Super tasty Kung Pao Chicken.  It's all good.  Five stars for nice staff (the people who take orders and deliver are always really nice and polite) and dependable/yummy/satisfying food.  Big Wa will not let you down!  PS: They give you free egg rolls if you spend more than $20.
1 Please be assured while reading this that I'm not normally one to have issues and complain. However the poor quality service that we'd received from Big Wa was angering and outrageous! I would totally give 0 stars for this review if possible based off of the bad (literally, and seriously) food and poor customer service.  Simply put one night we ordered from them, around they're closing time. After delivery the food below sub-par. The crab puffs and egg rolls were horridly pastey like they weren't cooked or were possibly old and soggy. Also the food was was pretty cold as well. The restaurant is only approx. less than 10m away so the poor quality of food was very disappointing. On top of that my friend ate his food (which he hadn't eaten anything else prior to eating his Big Wa meal all day) and got a really very bad upset stomach later that evening (actually in the early AM). The next day my friend told me about what a bad upset stomach ( to put it nicely) he'd had after eating his food and so I decided to call Big Wa and request his portion of the meal be taken off my debt payment. All the food was poor quality, sure but I decided to be an "accommodating customer" and only request that my friend's potion be removed from my bill instead of asking for a refund because of my friend being the only one who had any discomfort/ **bad gastrointestinal issues** (to put it nicely)  from the food.  Well, to wrap this up, let's just say that I very calmly described the issue to the person on the phone at Big Wa and instead of being courteous and helpful they argued with me until I decided that I'd had enough!   They also told me that in order for them to do any thing in regards to my bad food that: 1.Quote "They'd have to have q driver come pick up the food in order to prove that it was bad. "  2. That quote "since they were a small restaurant" that they'd "have no way of recalling my order" (from less than 24 hours) to this complaint call. And...  3. The most furiating!...They said (paraphrasing, but quoting...)that "my friend had to go to to doctor to prove the food caused my friend's stomach upset." P.s. my friends stomach wasn't just "upset"...I'm trying to be polite in saying while he didn't throw up, he did have some sort of "major major gastrointestinal" upset as a result from the food from Big Wa.   I called originally to *request only a portion* of my bill be taken off and ***ended the call *** with actually having to call my bank and dispute the bill in it's entirety! I tipped the driver pretty well too...and I'll be damned if I give any more money to this place now or ever!  Ai have the food in my fridge and as soon as I get in touch with my bank's ACH Disputes Dept. I'm going to have Big WA's driver come pick up their nasty food as proof! {Since that's what the person who I spoke with at Big Wa asked me to do after all, return my food as proof!) How ridiculous! This place is bad. Don't support this local restaurant! There's got to be better places....Keep looking until you find one with GREAT food AND customer service!  This place sux, pass it on!
1 Being of Chinese descent and growing up in family run restaurants, I know Chinese food.  There is a place for all types of Chinese food including fast food places like Big Wa.  The secret however, is that if you are a generic, run of the mill, sub par Chinese food restaurant, you need to compensate by having exceptional service and fast delivery.  This place fails on all counts.   This story starts all the way back in 2012. Going to the Mills one day to do some shopping is what introduced me to this place.  An employee of Big Wa was passing out menu's to people passing by and I grabbed one.  I work 5 minutes away in a call center and was organizing a company party and thought I would give them a shot to cater our event.  I let them know our budget, told them what I wanted, and everything was fine with the exception of one thing.  They were 20 minutes late.    After having a decent experience the last time, I decide to use Big Wa again for our party this year.  I order what I want and negotiate the price.  The original quote was over our budget, but took a few things off in order to stay within.  My main stress points were that there needs to be enough food for 25 people, and that they NEED to be on time.  Everything was agreed upon the day before and I advised them I would call in the AM to confirm.   On the day of our luncheon, I contact Big Wa at 11:00am to ensure everything was on target for noon.  They assured me everything was great, and that if I wanted, they can be here at 11:30am.  I had no problems with that as I would inform my employees to break earlier.  I stress once again, that punctuality is important.  11:28am rolls around, and I receive a call to let inform me that they are going to be LATE.  I remain calm and ask for a realistic time frame and informed 15-20 minutes.  12:00pm rolls around (the time they were supposed to be here) and they only bring in half of the order.  In a big rush he drops off the food, and tells me he will be right back w/ the other half.  15 minutes now pass and he comes in w/ the other half.  There is enough food to feed 25 people, because they gave us extra white rice and noodles, and nowhere near enough for everyone to have a little of everything including the entrees. There were no serving utensils, not enough plates, and the food was of course, far from exceptional.    I of course, call back to complain.  They offer no apologies and played dumb, so I proceeded to speak to them like they were idiots.
4 My food was great.  I ordred the Pu Pu platter and the Chicken Lo Mein lunch special.  The chicken in my main dish was tender, not rubbery and so full of flavor.  The portions were big.  I was very happy with my food.  The server did tell me that shrimp were out of season and the shrimp in the pu pu platter might taste kind of river-like and he was right, they were gross.  Other than that it was great.  I would have given them five stars had it not been for the river tasting shrimp but hey, he did warn me and I have to say the customer service was great.  The place was clean.  I would go back for sure.
3 I was debating on what to eat and decided to come here. Ordered the honey chicken for lunch and thought it was alright. The customer service was good and even offered water for me waiting. The vibe of the restaurant seems quiet and nice. I think the place is worth a try to those craving some chinese.
