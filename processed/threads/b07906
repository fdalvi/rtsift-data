5 Francisco of Central Towing came to my rescue to tow my car to the dealer.  He was not only swift at his job but was so pleasant and very informative.  He was very aware of others in the busy grocery store parking lot where my car was stranded.  Two times he had to deal with others not looking and almost driving into his very clean large tow truck.  He smiled and said it happens.  This guy was happy to do his job and do it well.  Great service!
1 I called Central Towing last night because I had accidentally locked my keys inside my car. They said it was going to be about a 25 minute wait. After an hour I called several times... no answer. They didn't show up until an hour and a half later!
1 This place took FOREVER to come. Driver lied to dispatch saying I wasn't with my vehicle and told them he had called me and I told him I would be there in 30 minutes. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. Unorganized and lack of integrity.
5 I was in the Phoenix area due to an emergency with my father.  Insurance company called this Central Towing.  Having a bit of knowledge in the towing venue I wanted to inform the company of my odd situation.  From the dispatchers to the driver:  all were super understanding of my dilemma and more than willing to go above and beyond.  Great prices.  Thank you so much for your help in my time of need.  Will defiantly use this company again and recommend to others. Thank you Big D (driver) with all the extras you did for me!!!
