5 I have a story about this particular florists...  About 3 years ago, my ex boyfriend was desperately trying to get back together with me - I'm quite a catch, y'know. We had broken up before I moved to Edinburgh but he didn't take it too well. Anyway, I hadn't heard from him in a few weeks so I thought he had moved on...until I got a phonecall telling me I had a package at reception. It was an empty vase and a single red rose. The card just said 'it's a' . I was totally confused...but low and behold the next day I got another phonecall, another package. Another rose...this time the card said 'new year' . Ok, so I was beginning to get it. Every day for a fortnight I got a rose with more words on it, concluding to 'it's a new year, so let's try a new start? meet me at the witchery, sunday 9pm' . Cute , huh!!   I was totally impressed with Interflora though, they were extremely professional and their customer service was brilliant. They knew that the overall message was - since they were sending it every day, but still enjoyed it alongside me.  They were absolutely brilliant.  You'll be glad to know I did go and meet my ex at the witchery and we did have a lovely meal. However, I told him we were never going to be together since he had slept with a married woman while we were together.   All's fair in love and war.
4 If you are an international student or resident here in Edinburgh like myself you may be relieved to know that yes there is an Interflora here to send pretty bouquets across the globe. My grandparents were sweethearts on my 21st when I received a beautiful vase sent to my flat from here- the delivery person was very professional and the flowers were gorgeous and lasted for days.
4 Interflora is perfect if you're need a bouquet for a housewarming, birthday, or if you're just in the dog house. You can either choose exactly what you want in the bouquet or just get a ready made one. The prices for bouquets are really rather reasonable and for the Â£20 mark you can get a mindblowingly beautiful bouquet whether you want to deliver it yourself or use their delivery service. Perfect.  Interflora can also cater for larger scale needs such as weddings and other special occasions.
