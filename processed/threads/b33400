3 Decent prices for gas, a tiny casino and few fast food options all in one.  This is truly a Trucker's paradise haha. It has showers available for cheap and a lobby area for people to catch up on today's news.  There are a few spots in the parking lot but a bunch of vagrants that hang around the area...
1 Website claims dog friendly area but there's nothing for dogs here.
1 This review only covers Burger King inside the Plaza. The food is over priced, it is significantly higher than all other Burger King Restaurants in town. Food was not the best, the lettuce in my burger was old, no crunch, the place is dirty, staff is not the friendliest.  SAVE YOUR MONEY. This place needs serious remodel or just leveled,  its an eye sore does not fit in with surrounding businesses,  it attracts "Tunnel People", these are the people that live in the "Wash Tunnels" under Interstate 15 in the Las Vegas strip corridor. Jack in the box across the street is clean and free of "Tunnel People"
2 Decent gas prices, high priced fast food, and beware if you have to go inside as lines move slow.  For a quick fill I have no complaints. Works well for heading north on Dean Martin.   The Burger King is more expensive than the one on LV blvd a mile or so away and not nearly as nice.   My real trouble is the connivence store line move slow. And I'm always waiting.
