5 the alan breck lounge is that rare thing in these beleaguered times , a proper, family run boozer. there are plenty of tv's for the sports fan, service is friendly, helpful and efficient. a pint of tennents is keenly priced at £2.85...and, best of all, it's across the road from my flat!
1 The bar staff and the pub was nice enough, but the swath of anti English sentiment, homophobic and sexisist comments left a bad taste. We popped in for a beer on the way home after a sunny day on the shore and realised none of us had been in this bar before. The place is nice enough and the prices are cheap - £6 for 2 pints. It was just the feeling of walking into a cowboy and western bar with the locals all turning round and making it clear you arent from these parts and definately not welcome. Hey ho you live and learn.
