5 Great service! Dan was on time and did an excellent job on my 2013 Mercedes. It shined more now than when I received it from the dealer. He even set me up to notify me every 6 months for a wash and wax. His prices are very reasonable and he's a professional.
5 I've hired Dan numerous times now. He's very nice and does great work! Shows up on time. Works quickly but efficiently. He details and washes my car, which has a matte finish, to perfection. I definitely recommend!
5 I inherited a new company car that had been passed around, and needed a solid detail job.  After having a negative experience with a company found via a Living Social deal, I found Dr.Detail through Yelp.  Called to obtain a quote.  Dan called back very promptly and was able to schedule me in a couple days later.  He showed up promptly, right on time.  A few hours later my car looked better than new!!  All spots were removed from carpet and upholstery.  The hood was so slick that I put my purse on top of it and it slid right off!  Dan was very professional and I would recommend to anyone.  You get what you pay for, and for $175 he does a great job!
