4 Every time I walk in there are about 4 different people asking if I need help. Great store
2 My wireless router died last night, so I needed a new one. Went to the Staples on Green Valley because it's located the closest to my house. I walk through the door and say "good morning" to the two 20-something employees glued to their phones busily texting (probably texting each other). Not even a peep out of either one of them.....never took their eyes away from their phones. Well, I'm used to those idorks behaving like that, so I just keep walking.      I go over to the computer section believing that is where the routers should be. Nothing.  I start aimlessly wondering around the store in a futile attempt to find what I'm looking for.  Again, nothing.  I actually considered trying to talk to the text twins, but decided against it.      As I start walking towards the front door.....lo and behold, what do I see? Behind the so-called "tech desk", I see routers!  Unfortunately, there are only three of them, and two of them are the same model. None of them are the model I had in mind.  Why didn't I ask the employee behind the desk are those were all they had in stock?  He was on his cell phone!!!    I left that place with a promise to myself never to go there again.  I ultimately went to the Staples on Lake Mead. I've been to that one before with good results. Good news! That one had the router I wanted and now I'm writing this review! Isn't technology great???
1 This review is about the store's hours. I've been trying to buy ink pad ink and every time I'm near this Staples, it is outside of their ridiculous store hours. Apparently they open at noon on Sundays, close at 7 (!) on weekdays, it's kind of stupid. As I'm writing this, I'm thinking: I've got an Amazon prime account... I'm going to buy my ink pad ink for cheaper and more conveniently from Amazon. Thanks Staples for saving me time and money!
5 The Copy & Print Center here is the best I've ever experienced!  Some of the best customer service I've had anywhere in Henderson.  Competitive pricing, fast service and accurate printing.  Awesome!
4 I just scored a Dell laser printer for $30 in a pre-black friday sale, so I really don't have any complaints. They were out online and it was a 20 min wait for customer support chat, but the nice lady checked stock at nearby stores and found 4 in stock at the Green Valley location.   I couldn't find it on the floor, but the employees were really friendly and helpful. Their inventory only showed 1 left in the back, so I'd call ahead even if online search shows that the store has it in stock.   I can't say how knowledgeable anyone is, since I walked in the door knowing exactly what I wanted. I thought they were great from a basic customer service stand point. And I like Staples in general, having dealt with them for my current and past companies. But we also spend over a million/year on office supplies, so they have a little more motivation to play nice.   Pricing is generally pretty high, but that's just how it is with office supplies. However they do have some great deals including online coupons and rebates - I've gotten free reams of paper with rebate coupons off their website.
