5 Finally. This is the kind of Yelp event that I've been waiting for. As much as I love eating with my fellow Yelpers, working out with them is even more fun.    A bunch of us did a free Dethrone Basecamp workout, which their website describes as:  "... a whirlwind of 30 1-minute exercises. It starts with one fast-paced minute on the Airdyne Bike. Then one minute off, doing an intense weight or bodyweight exercise. Then it's back on the Airdyne for another minute. Then another minute off. Repeat this cycle for 30 rounds. Top that off with some abs and core exercises at the end and you've got yourself an exhilarating, calorie calorie burning, body-toning, muscle building Basecamp Workout."  And, that's what we did.  I shared a bike with Niyen because we're about the same height.  The group was split up in A, B, C, and D groups, with half of each group on the bikes to start and the other half doing the assigned exercise for one minute on the exercise floor in front of the bikes. So, for example, I started on the bike for one minute while Niyen did the exercise assigned to our Group A, push-ups.  I rode for a minute and he did push-ups for a minute, then we switched, so he rode the bike and I did push-ups. The other groups had different exercises, but we all eventually did the same ones in the rotation. This continued for 30 minutes, with exercises that included box jumps, burpees, jumping lunges, medicine ball squats, TRX flyes and bicep curls, and deadlifts.  We then did 10 minutes of ab/core work on the floor together.    I don't normally do these types of exercises or classes, so I greatly appreciate the opportunities to step outside the box this month with Yelp Fit Club.  A big fat thank you goes out to Drew and Victoria for organizing this excellent event as well as to Dethrone Basecamp for hosting our group; I burned off at least one cronut last night.
5 Yelp Fit Club month continued at Dethrone Base Camp where a bunch of us came out for a fast and furious 45 minute workout which was taught by Ryan and assisted by Leslie. This HIIT style workout is great because it keeps you going, you work up a sweat in no time, your heart rate is constantly up, and you continue to burn off calories even after your workout. What is also awesome about DBC is that there series of exercises can also be tailored to ones capabilities whether you want to kick it up a notch, or down shift a bit and go at your own pace.  A series of 30 1-minute exercises are separated by a one minute push on the Airdyne Bike which is cool, because the harder you pedal, the more resistance you get, then its 10 seconds to transition into your next exercise. What I also liked about our workout is that some DBC regulars were alongside us doing the exercises, so we could see how its done, Ryan and Leslie also went around offering pointers and giving everyone words of encouragement, and at the same time, the exercise app on the screens showed you what exercise you were doing and how its properly executed. Definitely no chance of feeling "lost"...  Cleanliness is another important aspect of any workout facility, and DBC is SPOTLESS! All equipment is cleaned down after each group is done killing it, and I thought that little attention to detail was great.  Ball Bench Presses, Box Jumps, Burpees,TRX Strap Flyes and Curls, Jackknives, Deadlifts, Planks and many other exercises had us moving constantly using different equipment(weights, TRX Straps, Medicine Balls, Airdyne Bike) and even our own bodyweight, and the final 10 minutes was core work on the floor. We hydrated with lots of H20 and Vita-Coco afterwards.  BIG MAHALO to Drew, Victoria, and the awesome staff at Dethrone Base Camp for another ass-kickin' evening....ALOHA!!!

5 Out of breath is how I would describe myself in this fitness class.  Yelp Fit Club continued at Dethrone Base Camp with a 45 minute workout which was taught by Ryan and Leslie. They called this session a "Hit It ALL" and hit it all we did!.    We were divided into groups A,B,C and D and every minute we switched exercise which consisted of cycling, box jumps, ball bench press (all exercise balls have a different weight), planks, burpees, weights and lunges. It was also helpful to see on a screen what our next exercise would be.   I really liked using the Airdyne Bike because it keeps your heart rate up and the harder you pedal the more resistance it builds up.   The last ten minutes were dedicated to core and abs. Wow that was seriously the longest 45 minutes but I will say I feel awesome this morning!  Best of all this type of workout keeps burning calories up to 36 hours after! YAY!   The class was challenging but not intimidating as the instructors were helpful and very hands on showing us alternative ways of completing an exercise.They also offer many other exercise classes.  The location is great and the place is also very clean! We got to see the staff cleaning all equipment and floor after a class concluded and from what we were advised they repeat the cleaning after each and every class. They also provided towels and we got to hydrate with Vita-Coco and waters during and after our workout.   It was great exercising with a great group of Yelpers and friends!  A big thank you goes to all the awesome Dethrone Base Camp staff, Yelp, Drew, and Victoria for this amazing opportunity!  GO YELP FIT CLUB!!!!
5 Yelp Fit Club is on full swing and there couldn't have been a more perfect fit than Dethrone Boot Camp to kick things off!  Dethrone Boot Camp specializes in Cardio Circuit Training & Cardio Boxing Classes.  We stopped in for a Cardio Circuit Training Class.  The instructors, Ryan & Heidi, were helpful, friendly trainers that the presented dynamic class in an understandable manner.  The 45 min class consisted of one minute intervals for the 35 mins followed by 10 mins of core intensive workouts to finish things off.  The class was easily adjusted up or down to different levels...hence how Regina could kill it, pushing herself for 45 mins straight, while Earl could just go through the motions pretending to get a workout in (I jest of course since they are both beasts!)  Seriously though, this class can meet you where you're at and push you as much as you put into it.  Dethrone is also a solid facility.  They took care to clean the area and equipment between classes, had a variety of refreshments, and made good work of the space they have so that our entire group could workout without feeling cramped.  Your first class is free!...so stop in and check them out sometime...I could be the cardio solution you've been looking for!  Shout out thanks to staff at Dethrone as well as to Drew & Victoria for making this event possible!...Thanks everyone!
5 I'm a fairly active person and am currently training for the Tough Mudder event in April...That being said you know you have had a kick ass workout when you get home and it hurts to wash your face. Seriously... ;)  Dethrone is an awesome facility. You walk in and automatically feel a sense of "I can do this." The faculty and trainers were excellent! Extremely friendly, helpful, encouraging, motivational, and personable.  We took the high intensity cardio / circuit training class which is a grueling but also very fun combination of bikes/ floor exercises. The format is 1 minute on the bike, 10 seconds to get to the floor, 1 minute of floor exercises (ranging from planks, inchworms, v ups, box jumps, squats with weights, etc), 10 seconds to get back to your bike, and back on the bike for 1 minute. (For the next 30 minutes)  Heidi (the girl that was supposed to be leading the class) had apparently just gotten all four of her wisdom teeth pulled out earlier that day but was so pumped about being a part of our class that she stayed to help facilitate and train. (If that doesn't say amazing leadership I don't know what does!) Since Heidi's mouth was beginning to swell shut Ryan the Studio Manager lead our class - he is definitely a passionate instructor with a ton of knowledge. He encourages you to push yourself but to take ques from your own body, and keeps you motivated (without being over the top - super refreshing!!)  I learned a ridiculous amount in this 45 minute class, and used some sets of muscles that I haven't used in a very very long time...  In summery: Fantastic facility, amazing staff, kick ass class! Thank you Yelp for this awesome opportunity! Fit Club March rocks my socks! :)
5 What do you do after eating so much?! YOU EXERCISE! That way you could work off all that great and fabulous food you've been eating right?! Yeah no worries. That's not my typical thought process either. However, I do love to exercise when I eventually get to it.....  So not only does Yelp direct you to where the food is, it also directed us to where the workouts were! When I first read the description for this event, it intrigued me. I don't typically work out ... the most I do is jog if I do any exercise. I was a little worried about this class but then there was also a note saying it was beginner friendly. SO WHY NOT?!  I went. I saw. I got scared. That's usually how it goes huh. It looked pretty intense and from what some of the yelpers said, it is intense. OK! I will get through this! And I certainly did!  The class was a total of 45 minutes I believe? The first 30-35 minutes, we did 1 minute cardio exercises with 10 seconds in between every minute to switch. Then the last 10-15 minutes was ab work outs. The best part was that the cardio exercises you do were all different. They had tons of different exercises and you can do it to your own pace. You could go all out or take your time. Another thing was, if you couldn't do the exercise, you are free to sub it with an exercise you could do.   Ex. The exercise was box jumps. Seeing as the box was almost half of my height, I had to switch to step ups using the box instead. I was NOT jumping on that! I mean, I could but my legs were already tired so I didn't want to risk falling flat on my face.   I also loved how the instructor would come around and correct our forms/postures. Trust me when I say that 99.999% of these exercises, I have never done in my life. So I'm very grateful to be corrected in the positions I wasn't so sure on.   And the CLEANLINESS. Oh I love it. They were CLEAN, clutter free, and SIMPLE.   Overall, great place! Your first class is free as well so if you aren't so sure, you can definitely give it a try. They have kickboxing too, which I am highly curious about.   Thanks to Dethrone, Drew, and Victoria for this event! I had a blast and it was a very refreshing change to pigging out :P HAHA!
4 Lordy. What did i get myself into? For 2014 I had decided to try and be healthier, and thus have not participated in as many Yelp events as I would like. Not to worry though, Yelp Fit Club to the rescue.  Honestly, I haven't done any consistent exercise in about ten years. I am not in good shape. When I signed up for the event at Dethrone. Boot Camp I honestly did not know what the heck it was about.  Long story short, you are divided into groups, and several groups are cycling on bikes while the other are given a series of crazy cardio exercises. The instructor, whose pep pines was like on crack, made sure that we were doing the exercises correctly. I was pooped after 10 minutes, but peer pressure pushed me to finish. That and Doriee (don't believe her, she's in great shape).  After the class I was tired but went up to the instructor to thank him. I told him that Yelpers are more known to eat, not exercise. Hahaha!   Seriously, what can I say dude? It's exercise. I hate it. But the event was fun, and the trainers really know their stuff. So this is definitely an option for normal human beings that like to stay healthy and active.
5 I'm a huge fan of circuit training boot camp style workouts so I was excited to try Dethrone.  It was a pretty full class so we were told to partner up with someone that was similar in height because the way the class is ran is one of us is on the Airdyne bike while the other is doing an exercise on the floor portion.  So one minute on the bike and one minute doing push-ups, burpees, box jumps, dead lifts, etc.  For the floor portion of the workout there is monitors so you won't get confused as to what exercise you should doing based on what group you are in.    Ryan was our main instructor as Leslie had just had dental work done but she was on hand to assist in exercise form and set up.  It was a really fun, fast paced class.  Ryan said besides the class we took that night they also have a boxing circuit type class with a minute on the bike and a minute boxing.    I think this is a great option for people that don't want to go to a big box gym, enjoy group classes and want some guidance.  It's also good for all fitness levels because you can push yourself to your max or modify if needed.    Thanks to Drew, Victoria, Ryan and Leslie.  This was one of my favorite Fit Club events!
5 What an awesome workout!  This was an intense (cry worthy) 45 minutes going back and forth from the bike to a variety of floor/weight exercises in 1 minute intervals.  I liked the upbeat and encouraging instructors.  Thanks for the yelp event!
