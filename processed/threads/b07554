5 Ilya's ROCKS These dudes are Russian (Sunny Slope has got a lot of Russian businesses) Razor cut $20.00 wif tip - I will get treated like god the next time.
5 $14.00 for a great haircut, hot lather and straight razor neck shave, hot steamy towel and a shoulder massage. I will go every time I am in Phoenix. I was there 12/31/2011 and 06/09/2012.
2 New to area was looking for a hair cut for my son. Short haired lady cut his hair. I showed her a picture of a short haired taper. She left long on top and the shape of his Mohawk in the back. I won't return.
5 Since I moved here in 2009, I've got my hair cut here without any troubles. I now live 30 miles away and still make it a point to get my hair cut here. Walk-ins seem to be preferred here and no one typically waits longer than 10min. Highly recommend if you're like me and enjoy hair cuts.
