5 I've rented from this Uhaul 3 times. It is fast and affordable and they don't try and upsel you a bunch of crap you don't need. Mike has been here a long time and he is very helpful and friendly.
5 Wow, these guys had the truck I needed, explained everything and were extremely pleasant to deal with.  In addition, they helped me calculate the costs of my next move.  Efficient, friendly, helpful guys.  Great to deal with at a stressful time.
5 great place been renting trucks for years and they always have propane and its not super expensive
1 The owner was agitated on arrival,aggressive, rude, i tried to rent a Trailer and a truck to pull it, then he tried to tell me that the truck does not come with a "ball hitch" and I would have to buy one at 30-40 dollars including tax additional to all rental costs of both.  I said that this is unreasonable and a "rip off" this infuriated the owner (wears Glasses) and shouted i am not in the business of ripping people off and said to go elsewhere........ gladly i did.  Do not do business with this guy....you have been warned......
