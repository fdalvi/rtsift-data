5 Absolutely LOVED this dentist office.   They were extremely friendly, got me in and out quickly, and the dentist herself was very thorough and sweet and walked me through my x-rays and explained everything to me.  Would recommend to anyone and will definitely go back!
5 Everyone is friendly & professional;  especially the two most important ie: dentist and hygienist.  Definitely recommend this office.
5 My family and I have been coming here for the past eight years and we all love this office. All the staff are really good at what they do, & they make everything as painless as possible. Dr. Mower & Dr. Tullman are both incredibly skilled.
