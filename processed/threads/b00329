1 Run by college students for college students. Which is good if you are a UW student, bad for everyone else. I have seen fellow students get fat sandwiches and extras for no extra cost. While the rest of the world gets a skinny sandwich and crap service. I only go here if I have no other choice. I suggest going down the road to University Station and hit the Subway there. Better service and sandwiches.
3 Hey Subway,  Don't be so stingy with the napkins. If I need an extra couple napkins, don't make me feel like a beggar.  I look forward to your cooperation in remedying the matter.  -Concerned Citizen
1 OH DEAR GOD. Someone please teach the employees here how to better scrub the toilets. I almost lost my appetite after using the women's restroom.  This Subway has NOT been closed as may have been reported by other Yelpers (I was just there on Friday), but may be it should be.
