5 Totally cool driver. I was late and he helped me catch my bus. Above and beyond.
1 Beware, this cab company took me on a long haul all around the city on my trip from the Airport to the strip.
4 We were lucky to have found Lucky cab. They were able to accommodate us at the time requirement that we needed them.  The guy on night dispatch was able to help us out and we really appreciate it.
3 Pro's: prompt, courteous & safe drivers. Con's: dodgy cabs look dirty inside & stink of smoke, $3 "V fee" they don't tell u about, while in cab u get treated to endless cirque promo on their TVs that makes u want to swear off cirque (and I love cirque). Note:  if you pay via credit card they charge you a $3 fee called a "V fee".  I took about 5 cab rides and figured it was some kind of Vegas tax thing.  Found out from very last cabbie on way to airport that it's a service fee for using the credit card and I could've avoided it by paying cash.  I hate paying these kind of fees so I really wish the first guy would've said something and saved me about $15.
5 Called for pickup at corporate park, showed up in 15 minutes later and got me to the airport quickly per my request.
4 Fast and courteous. Honest about pick up time.  They picked me up on short notice. Would have given them 5 stars except the driver kept talking about her blood test.
1 Ride to airport for flight home was taken the LONG way to airport. We were charged $32.70. Trip from airport to Venetian was $18.50. I have been to Las Vegas multiple times and know my way around. On this trip we had the WORST taxi service. Trip to airport was last straw. Will chose to walk, run, take a shuttle or pick another vacation venue. I hope others will boycott Vegas taxis!
