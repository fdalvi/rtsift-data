1 I've gotten my nails here before and the gentleman did an excellent job.  I bought some hair extensions and figured the hair stylists must be great as well.  I think not!!!  The nail technicians and hair stylists do work separately as a business.  When I brought my CLIP IN hair extensions, all I wanted was for them to get trimmed and layered to blend into my hair.  She clipped them in for me which took less than 10 mins.  She also cut them (horribly).  Once she was done I asked her how much the total was and she said $85!!! I asked "why so much?"  Her response was "well uh, I did put your extensions in."  I was very disappointed.  I could of put the damn extensions in myself, it takes very little effort.  I could understand if she had to glue them in, but seriously?  Clip in extensions?    I had to go to another salon to have them fix the mistake this lady made.  The new salon showed me how to properly put them in and even numbered them for me so I know which extension goes where.  Guess how much my total was?  $30!  And she did an excellent job.  So if you feel like getting ripped off and getting a crappy hair cut please come to this place.  Now I can't speak for all the stylists here.  I wish i remembered this lady's name.  I think it was Angie or Angela?  I never write reviews, but I thought I should let others know if they consider coming here.
5 Tina does the best nails, weather its mani or pedi, gel or polish, and great designs too.
1 Had a manicure and pedicure here - one of the worst I've ever had.  Literally, by the time I drove home my nails were already chipping.  Short on time and getting ready to leave on business, I had to touch my nails up at home even after paying for the service.
5 Tina is awesome! Great designs, and she's soooo nice.
5 Love tina!
1 First, this place is filthy dirty, I shouldn't have let them touch my nails based on that alone. From there it gets worse. I went in for a gel manicure. The guy doing my nails made me bleed pretty badly while cutting my cuticle and then proceeded to paint the gel right into the blood. So my manicure didn't look very nice to say the least and that also is very unsanitary! Then he overcharged me. A regular manicure is $12, they charged me $35 for a gel manicure, completely ridiculous price. I definitely won't ever go back and I suggest you avoid this place as well.
5 Love this place!!  Has been my 'home' for nails and hair for 5 years.  Staff is super friendly and treats me like family. I always get compliments on the nails that Charlie and Ryan do for me and Sherri keeps me neat and trim.  Very relaxed and laid back and not over priced.
1 I had a tried this place. When I first walked in for a pedicure I was placed in a chair and sat there for at least 2 hour waiting for service. Then looked at the dirty floor and felt. I should run out of this place. The only person that seemed kind at all was the girl sitting next to me.  Seems they felt they were doing me a favor instead of acting loyal and respectful or hospitable for your business. I felt the man that did my pedcurei was rude and couldn't hold a conversation other then you should get this or that. More Money! And when he was done. He never thanked me for my business or politely removed himself. It was a none caring attitude and on to the next and didn't even excuse himself. I found this first impression. RUDE, Unprofessional and dirty.....
5 I've been coming here for about 6 years and they have been nothing but the nicest and best people for nails. I go and usually end up with Tina to do my eyebrows and my gel manicure and pedicure. No matter how far I move I don't trust anyone with my eyebrows so I don't mind the trip.
