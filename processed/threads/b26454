5 I found myself at West End Obgyn after many failed attempts to confirm pregnancy at a nearby doctors office. I was pleased to find out that all ultrasounds, bloodwork and everything else are all completed in office...what a relief! Dr. Pollock is great. He delivered my son at Southern Hills Hospital. I will continue to go to him for all future obgyn needs.
5 Best Ob-gyn in Las Vegas hands down.  Couldn't be happier.  I have seen him for 3.5 years now on a referral from a friend and he is outstanding.  I have sent 8 patients to him including family because he listens, he cares, he's sarcastic (which can really help when dealing with all the ups and downs) in a good way, and as long as I'm always on time he sees me quickly.  One day I cried in his office and he did not leave and I don't know this for sure until I think he thought he had cheered me up, which while I was super depressed I really really thought was the most thoughtful thing a human let alone a doctor could do for someone at that point.  Very good doctor!  He has also referred me to all my other doctors who are just as good in their specific areas.
1 My perinatologist referred me to dr pollock but when I made an appointment they had me see a different doctor. The next time around I wanted to make sure I get to see the right doctor and they denied my request that I can't see him as I was seen by a different doctor. Can you believe this crap?
5 I was so worried about finding a great Dr when I left Oregon. I was referred to him by a clinic so I was a little skeptical at first. Couldn't have been luckier to get him as my OB/GYN... He is very attentive and caring.He goes above and beyond the call of duty!!! Unfortunately for him, he is stuck with me!!! :)
