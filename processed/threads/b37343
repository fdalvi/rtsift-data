5 Angela is one of the most brilliant women I know. she is always on top of things and knows the best ways to avoid paying Uncle Sam too much. The previous reviewer obviously didn't give her the correct information. The other people in the Taxanista's office are very capable and do a great job. I recommend this office highly.
5 This office is super energetic and will put you at ease during tax season. So easy to work with and very friendly! I highly recommend them! Thank you for doing a great job on my taxes:)
5 We first met with Angela at the peak of tax season, and yet we never felt rushed during our first meeting. Her great attention to detail, her wonderful personality, the staff she works with, and just everything about her, all wrapped up to something I never thought I'd utter -- she actually made taxes fun. She doesn't make us feel stupid when we're asking all sorts of questions that could easily be misconstrued as ignorant, and she answers them all with grace and thoroughness, and doesn't baffle us with jargon mumbo jumbo. We all have special tax situations that we need an exceptional accountant for, and with our situation involving foreign travel and foreign businesses, she certainly brought her A-game to the table. I get the feeling we'll be working with her for quite some time.
