5 This is not a large outlet.  It's personal service!  They specialize in one on one consultations, insuring that I get the attention and professional advice I look for.  Skipping a large showroom full of over zealous employees ensures a low overhead which they pass on to their customers.  They do have a showroom, and they do carry many consumer favorites, if they don't have it, they can get it.  Not only would I do business with them again, I already have.
5 I have had nothing but great expereinces with Discount Gun Source. Personally I have purchased two guns from them and numerous friends I have sent also purchased firearms. Their prices are always at or below market value, not to mention the personalized service you receive once you walk in. I look forward to doing more business with Discount Gun Source in the near future.
5 I would say this is the best gun shop to go to in Las Vegas the amount of time Jim takes with you is great he takes his time explaining the firearms and what fits you best and what your budget is. I bought a S&W M&P Shield 9mm got the lowest price in Las Vegas I'm military active duty and I was surprised he even beat shooter's price I had also gone to northwest firearms,therange702,newfrontierarmory and did some online research and he got me the best price.Definitely recommend this ship to anyone looking to purchase a firearm or accesories email him or call him. Thanks Jim look forward to doing business with you again
