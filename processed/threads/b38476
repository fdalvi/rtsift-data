2 This place is way to expensive for the product and service they deliver. I dropped of two simple women's blouses and the bill was over $13! The gal behind the counter when I dropped off and pick up seems miserable! She refuses to make eye contact and is impossible to chat with.  I will be looking for friendlier service with a much more reasonable price tag.
2 For the price, I expect very good service.  However, consistently they do not pick up my clothes when I schedule them to.  When this happens, I am forced to wait another 4 days or bring the clothes in myself.  Not sure where the disconnect is but they need to get this piece figured out!
5 Dropped off about 10 shirts to get cleaned and they came out perfect.   Counter lady isn't that friendly but the service is awesome.   I will use them for now on.
5 I have been  customer since Brad opened his downtown shop many years ago. I am now a regular customer of his Desert Ridge shop.   Organic's attention to detail is astounding. Brad recognizes individual shirts. His staff removes collar stays before pressing, which preserves and makes my shirts look great. He puts nice , temporary cufflinks in my French cuff shirts.   Organic is the only Dry Cleaner that I trust to keep me looking my best.
