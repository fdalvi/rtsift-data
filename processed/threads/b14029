4 Employees a few years ago were wonderful, friendly.  Staff has changed and the new manager was extremely rude.  Went back a few weeks ago and seems like things have turned around (thank goodness this is very close to my house).  Managers are wonderful and the staff great now.
3 I went there a few times. I decided not to return when the staff gave me the wrong order, which I noticed when I arrived at home and had to drive all the way back to get my correct order. They just gave me the right order. I would have expected at least a free drink or dessert or something... Can't beat Li's Bowl.
5 Dan helped us there.  My office goes there all the time for lunch and they are always speedy, accurate and friendly.  They seemed to be trained consistantly and always offer an egg roll and medium drink.  The entrees are always warm and seem fresh.
4 Good clean location. Food was freshly cooked when I went for lunch. Friendly staff, no complaints. I'll be going back to this one. :)
