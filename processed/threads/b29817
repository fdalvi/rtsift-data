1 Avoid this florist - period. I should have checked Yelp, but of course didn't until after the fact. We've always used ProFlowers which has always been pretty good. This time I wanted to use a local florist. GGG Flowers is just down the street from my mom's house. I went online and ordered through their website; I live in California.  I called GGG the next day to give specific instructions on where to deliver the flowers as my mom can't hear the doorbell/knocking very well. Because the woman on the other end could barely understand English, I had to repeat myself and my instructions at least 10 times and that is not an exaggeration.   I had my brother take a picture of the flowers I ordered to see if they matched with their online picture. I just had a gut feeling that what they show on their website is not what you get. I was absolutely right.   So, as of this writing I am giving them one star. I will contact them tomorrow and voice my extreme disappointment and give them a chance to make good by making another flower arrangement or refunding my $$. I'll follow-up with the outcome.
1 Avoid this place! Ordered on the phone, then I showed up and apparently gave my order away to someone else! They scrambled and put together something else which was nice but then they double charged my account. Tried to call and they can't speak English, she said she would take care of it, didn't ask me for my name or anything! They can't provide customer service, I guess unless you speak Mandarin. Save yourself the hassle just pay more at a better place.
