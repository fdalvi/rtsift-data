4 Quirky interior and quite a small place overall make for I expect quite an intimate experience when the place is full. Very friendly and efficient service too.    Nice touch listing all their local suppliers on the menu before you even get to the dishes. Not though immediately obvious that it's a bit nouvelle so consequently my companions the othernight had only potatoes with their steaks.    My leak and something fish cakes were a tasty starter and the main course of Asian Dumplings was very well made and so colourful it was almost a shame to eat it. Chocolate Brownies and ice cream went down well for dessert and the creme brulee was pronounced good too.    Good selection of wine on offer and very keenly priced aperitifs (can't remember seeing 42 Below with a mixer for as little as Â£3 anywhere else). Definitely one to revisit.
3 Lazy Lohan's is a bistro with a difference in Edinburgh. My first visit was somewhat disappointing, they had not long opened and hadn't got a liqueur license yet so we had to bring our own, and service was slow. Plus we were the only diners. But my second visit, for lunch, was somewhat better. The food is good, really yummy and enjoyable, but again I was disappointed with the service. And the restaurant is tiny, very small. There are only around 6 tables in total, and I imagine it would be very cramped when full. However, whenever I walk past the bistro it never seems to be open. I get the impression it's the sort of place you need to book, and yes it's pleasant and the food is great, but the location and size is a shame. It has potential, a diamond in the rough.
5 Apart from the inexplicably bad name (is it a reference Lindsay Lohan, and if so, by God, why?), Lazy Lohan's is a unique find in Edinburgh. They're entirely committed to using local and organic ingredients, as well as seasonal produce and flavours, which means that the menu changes fairly regularly. They serve an exciting variety of simple and delicious fare.  Tina, the owner, is often around and will happily answer any questions you might have about the food. Their produce is sourced by Whitmuir Organics and is exquisitely fresh and tasty.  The space is small and intimate, though you could imagine on a busy day, it would easily feel crowded. I recommend going there for brunch on a Saturday, for a solid cup of coffee and french toast with caramelised bananas (you could add a side of bacon too). Reasonably priced, and lovingly prepared, it's a wonder why Lazy Lohan's isn't more well known.
