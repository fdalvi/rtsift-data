4 I have been to a few kid bouncy parties before and some of them the other Pump It Up locations.  The place is clean, neat, but a little warm.  The staff is very nice.  This location is a little different.  They had 3 rooms.  Room #1 - 3 bouncy:  small slide, basketball, and obstacle course.  We were in there for 30 to 40 mins.  Then Room #2 - 3 bouncy again:  Huge slide, mini obstacle, and boxing ring.  Again, another 30 to 40 mins.  Room #3 - Cake and pizza room.   All the kids had fun but they were sweaty.  But room #3 they turn down the AC so it was cool after 15 mins.
2 Clean location.  Staff could be more energetic.  They were yawning, during the party.
5 We held my daughter's birthday party here this weekend and I have to say I couldn't be happier. From the first phone call I made to inquire about the party until the very end with the presents being loaded in the trunk for us, I was pleased. The staff was very helpful and the kids had a blast. I loved the fact that I felt like I got to enjoy the party too since I had so much help from the staff. I would definetly recommend Pump It Up to other parents in the area.
4 Much better now! I took both of my daughters there last fall and they loved it. Then in January I was told that my youngest was not big enough; this made it challenging for me to take my girls. I just went back for the 1st time since then and there are toys for younger kids to play with now. Both girls had a blast and I will start going back there again. I just wish there were bounce houses designated just for the younger kids. That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.
