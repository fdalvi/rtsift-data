1 Stepping into the Victoria Bar is like stepping back into time - a traditional pub, mostly full of old men drinking pints and muttering in low voices about the football scores in the dark.  The pub itself isnt bad, a standard pub decor and decent in size with the bar against the far wall as you enter - however, during my (very swift) pint, the staff were rude, and sounded throughly bored with serving anybody ever again. The Victoria Bar, does however, sell a large range of ales - possibly its only redeeming feature.  Needless to say, this isnt my type of bar - i felt massivly out of place, and what was worse, I knew it just as well as all of the regulars.
3 I doubt I will ever drink in Victoria Bar again, however, I can see how it might appeal to some locals as a decent place to meet up for a drink and a chat.  The place is frighteningly dark and my mates and I just about called out a 'hello?' when we walked in.  On closer inspection though, there were some men sat wearily in the corner guarding their pints.  The decor is alright, but you have to be up pretty close to see it.  The staff are okay, but do seem pretty short with you.  On the plus side, all their drinks are well priced and they have an impressive range of spirits including local Scottish malt whiskeys and beers.   As said before, this perhaps isn't the place to go if you're a student, then again, they probably don't care.
2 When I'm 80, I'm gonna love the hell out of this place. No conversation, no music and no hassle. I can die in the corner with a silent dignity.  But right now, I'm young and I hate it. It's a bar for dead.
1 This bar is really pretty awful. Full of old men that clearly don't want you to be there, the pub (like the customers) is on its last legs. Old, tatty and dirty, this is one pub I won't be going back to.   The clientèle are hostile, as are the staff. The beers are exactly the same as everywhere else. The interior and atmosphere are terrible. Don't come here
1 The highlight of our visit here has to be the lengthy typed 'banned list' on the wall.   There is so much to say about this place, so let me start with the positives... - The characters inside seem lovely, this is clearly their second home but they have such a lovely sense of community with they darts and dominoes club. - When Joe and I walked in we didn't feel unwelcome despite the fact that we stuck out like a saw thumb. - The drinks are unbelievably cheap, £1.70 for a vodka lime and soda. - Although we didn't try any, they had a small food menu, rolls for 90p and a burger for about £1.70.  However, there are many negatives... - It was close to 100°c inside. - Smelled like an old people's home. - Generally a bit manky. - It was like an old men's social club, not somewhere a 26 year old female really fits in!  So overall, if you are an old man who wants to sit in the pub all day with some friends, then this is the place for you!
4 We visited here for a night cap one evening and I love the place. It has darts and people playing dominoes.. ha awesome whats not to like. Within a few minutes the regulars had introduced themsleves and we were deep in conversation about my companions favourite topic, the bars of Edinburgh. I mention this because it is a rare thing in Edina for this to happen. I grew up further up north in a small town and people were a lot more ... chatty when you ventured into a new place.  They have a very standard set of booze and food on offer. All the drinks sampled were kept well and the owner even gave my friend a tour of the cellar while they were discussing the storage of ales... yep!! :D  The bar itself is comfortable enough and exactly what I expected of an old mans pub. Signs printed on a ink jet printer displaying there food offeres, drinks promotions and announcements about various things of interest to the local community that the bar services. The place is basic but functional I guess is the best way to describe the decor. In the states this would be in dive bar teritory I guess.  All in friendlly and knowledgable bar staff with some interesting locals. I probably wouldnt eat here persay but I would definately pop back in for a beer and  a game of darts.
