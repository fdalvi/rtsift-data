5 I met Melinda two years ago when she was working with other trainers in the South Bay. She accepted my 65 lb. pit with an open heart and open arms and had no hesitation walking him or helping to train him with her positive methods. My previously excitable and reactive big guy has had Melinda's help in her classes - graduating from Canine Good Citizen and passing the Therapy Dog class. He went on the be positively evaluated by Therapy Dog Internationals trainer, too. My dog would not be the same without Melinda's positive, calm and progressive training methods and we are thankful for her good cheer and professionalism. As an aside - she also taught him how to shake hands in about 5 minutes and he now uses this skill to break the ice with new people! Thanks to Melinda and Pawsitive Partners for helping me cement my positive relationship with my dog!
5 Melinda knows what she is talking about when she discusses how to train my maniac of a dog. I've received her help many times about issues with my hyper active canine and she's quick to give me tips that I can easily do and they have always worked. She loves the animals she works with and gives them specific training instructions to their own needs. Keep it up Melinda!
5 Melinda has been a part of my dog, Tanner's, life since I adopted him a couple months ago.  We are currently in her Basic Manners class and he has become the leave it pro!  She always has answers to my questions and great tips that I am confident will help Tanner grow from the energetic puppy that he is into a perfectly behaved dog.  She is truly passionate about dogs and I highly recommend Pawsitive Partners if you love your dog as much as I love mine!
