5 Great service, great fish taco, CHEAP DrINkS!!!
5 Great value, helpful chatty staff, kinda a locals hangout...we are from out of town yet made to feel very comfortable. Fish tacos were good not great, but everything else was perfect. If you're looking for something other than the overpriced strip stuff, Charlie's could be on your list!
