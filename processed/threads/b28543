5 One of my favorite places in town! The owner is always on the lookout for what you may need, but also has a fantastic eye, and has both unique and staple pieces in her shop.   She is  someone to shop again and again with, because she will always know how things will fit on you, and what you like. The shop is cute, small, and there is always a new art show opening every month!   Such a hidden treasure, we are lucky to have FlockFlockFlock in Vegas!!  (the prices are awesome also!)
5 As a dude, I love this place, even though the clothes are for the gals. Here you will discover some extraordinary finds. The owner has an excellent eye for design and can rework a dud into dynamite. Unlike many vintage boutique clothing stores, the prices here are surprisingly affordable, downright cheap at times. Almost makes me want to be a cross dresser....almost.
5 Jennifer constantly wows with her editing of clothing and her creative energy in the creations she spins! It makes me wish I were a girl just so I could shop in there and wear what she sells!   So awesome! Go Jenn!!!
