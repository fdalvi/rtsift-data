5 I've got my lashes done here for few times now. Elise is very sweet girl. She is very detail oriented and careful about my lashes (she would ask me if I am ok when the tweezer barely touched my eyelids). She plays relaxing music and lights up candles during the session. I felt very relax during the entire session. (I sometimes fall asleep during session! That's how comfortable I feel!) I love that she only does one lash to "one" extension, and she only uses lashes from Extreme Lashes. (Extreme makes the best lashes) She also told me she is like a "lash patrol"! She doesn't allow anything that would ruin the real lashes. I really appreciate how much attention to details she pays to my lashes. Elise always does wonderful job. I highly recommend her if you want beautiful lashes and someone cares/loves lashes very much.
5 Elise is the best!! She is so gentle when working on your lashes and cares so much about your comfort. The ambiance and atmosphere Elise provides is serenity, super relaxing and soothing. Elise always washes her hands before touching your eyes. I always fall asleep because I'm so comfortable. The results are always 100% amazing and they always look great as well last for awhile. She uses the best of the best products. If you're looking for a good lasher Elise is your girl!
