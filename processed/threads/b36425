5 This is the second time I have used their services. I originally went to their Scottsdale location for an oil change, and as promised was done promptly. Well, my oil had been leaking for awhile due to stripped threading on the actual pan (not the screw) so the whole thing needed to be replaced. Months later I called and James (I think he's the owner) was able to find a used pan and get the job done the same day I called!  They are humble, friendly, and most importantly, Honest mechanics!  Highly recommended!
5 This place has great service! The mechanic is extremely knowledgable and honest. He does good work and charges a fair price.   My car wouldn't start one day but when the tow truck got to me it started. I thought my starter was going out, but I took my car here and he knew right away that it needed a battery. He put in a new one to check it and make sure that was the problem. He said I could take it somewhere else but he dialed O'Reilly's and had me ask them what they charge to prove he was giving me a good deal. This is definitely a good place to bring a vehicle for repairs.
5 Great service and price! Got a sweet punch card that makes my 5th oil change free! :) I will definitely be recommending this place to my friends.
