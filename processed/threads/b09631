1 The guy who works nights here is a real piece of shit. He just spent 5 minutes lecturing my friends on how American love is shallow and based on "fucky-fucky" and men should be worshipped by their wives "like Jesus Christ".
1 I have to wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewer. I just literally waited an hour sitting in a dirt field across the street waiting for the Shell to open rather than spend another CENT at this place.  What happened this morning? I walked up to the Shell to pick up a pouch of Bugler tobacco - $3.21 after tax. I brought $3.50 with me. Well, apparently they're closed between 2-4AM for stocking of the store.  So I ventured across the street to the Chevron - NOT my first time there either.  I've been to this place on numerous occasions.  And EVERY time I've bought a scratcher ticket here, I've heard the same nonsense. Clerk: You can only pay cash for scratchers. You cannot pay debit or credit.  Me: I have cash.  Clerk: You can only pay cash.  Me: I only have cash.  Clerk: You cannot pay with debit/credit. Only cash.  Me: I ONLY pay with cash. NEVER with a card. I HAVE CASH!!  Well...back to tonight's straw that broke the camel's back.   Me: What is the cheapest pouch of roll your own tobacco? Clerk: I have Bugler for $4.00 and I have top.  Me: Which is the CHEAPEST you have? Clerk: I have Bugler for $4.00  I don't HAVE 4 bucks on me, and just walked 20 mins to get there (early morning exercise is the BEST btw).   Me: How much for a single cigar.  Clerk: $1.65 Me: Do you have any multipack cigars for $3 or less? Clerk: No, no, no.  Me: What are those packs of Swisher cigars that say "5 for 3"? Clerk: They are $5.99!! Me: But it says "5 for 3".  Clerk: It was the old owners price. I charge $5.99.  Me: But it says "5 for 3". You're charging 5 for $5.99. Maybe you should take that down. It's false advertising.  Clerk: I charge $5.99. That was the OLD price.  Me: That's DOUBLE what is advertised. That's like advertising $3 for a gallon of gas and when I come to pay, you charge me SIX!! Because that was the OLD price.  And, let me state: This bastard (as ALWAYS) gave me attitude from the get go.   I told him that I work hard for my money, and I DON'T have to spend it there. That I could go across the street.  He tells me to go.  I them proceed to tell him that I am the CUSTOMER. I can take my money to any other gas station. What happens if he does that to everyone? You won't have a business. I told him that I proudly served my country for him to be able to move here to live. I told him that I didn't want to ASSUME he wasn't from America, but it was pretty obvious he wasn't (India).  He then try's to scan the cigars to show me what the ring up as.  I told him that I would never spend another CENT here, and would inform everyone I know to do the same. I told him that he could watch my money walk out the door and wait an hour across the street.  And I did.  I encourage YOU to sit in that dirt field too, my friend...
1 I have to agree with both of the reviews here. The employees here are horrible. I stopped going here a long time ago because of that. They make you feel extremely uncomfortable & unwelcome. Today I needed a quick wash for my car & decided to go through the one they had here since I didn't need to go inside for it. That was a mistake. First of all it's $6 for a crappy quick wash and second it left my car looking dirtier after then it did before.
