3 This McDonald's is located at the food side entrance of the Nellis at Craig Walmart Super Center.   At the time that I stopped in Walmart on the way to Utah, I ate breakfast here. This McDonald's exceeded my expectations. I expected a shoddy McDonald's in one of the Las Vegas valley' s older super centers. Instead, I was eating in a clean and surprisingly cozy McDonald's. I am under the impression that it was recently refurbished. The interior shows off McDonald's history through portraits of the first McDonald's. The booths are extraordinary comfortable for  a McDonald's. Disparate from a few Las Vegas Valley Walmart McDonald's, this location offers more breakfast items. Including the egg McMuffin.   On my visit, they served me the egg McMahon meal in a short period of time. The coffee was hot. And I left satisfied.   Keep in mind that I ate here around 9:45 AM, before the Saturday morning rush. So, I have not seen how this McDonald's is when there is a rush of people.
1 No, just no. I understand that the food I order will never ever come out like it looks in the picture, but gadaam, don't mean you gotta give me burnt buns on both my mcdoubles. Women, I told you no pickles.. and what did I get?? Probably the largest slices in the bunch. Now I get it's  morning... your tired.. well I'm tired too! When I say good morning at the window I expect some kinda of acknowledgement.
1 Kids playplace smells awful and there is food everywhere.  Will never go there except the drive thru.  Drive thru staff is very pleasant and polite, but it doesn't make up for the messy playplace.
