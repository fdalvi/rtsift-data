4 This must be the smallest spa of the large hotels on the strip (at least the ones I have been to) but what they have done with it, they did well. Its dim, inviting, peaceful, and has a wonderful fitness room on the top floor. I would definitely come back.
3 The MGM Grand Spa is a nice facility with warm, earth-tone decor and every amenity you can think of, including cold bottled water, fruits, granola bars and teas to enjoy while relaxing in the lounge area.  The women's side of the spa was a bit convoluted, but I found my way around eventually.  The main problems we had were with the rude front desk women who didn't want to help us find convenient reservations together, and who kept telling my husband he was not in the The Signature hotel room he claimed to be in when he checked in for his treatment.  His services card was then shoved across the counter for his signature without any explanation nor acknowledgment that his name had indeed been associated with the room number, and he was told to go to the spa area without any direction at all.  The spa operations also had a bit of a mechanized feel to it, with lots of people waiting in the lounge and being called in one-by-one as if in a hospital waiting room.  Behind the first set of doors is a long hallway with lots of smallish treatment rooms on either side -- not a very soothing feeling to be one of many laboratory guinea pigs.  However, once you meet your highly qualified aesthetician or therapist and you're resting under the warm massage blanket, that vague sterile feeling dissipates.  I had a short back and shoulder massage (not deep enough for my knots, but everyone is afraid of hurting me), followed by an awesome facial by another lady named Trea.  If this review was only for Trea, she would get 5 stars.  I loved her cheerful and gentle manner, and her incredibly light touch.  Over in the men's side of the spa, my husband also relaxed under an excellent massage.  Unfortunately, he continued to receive the rude treatment outside; he did not receive a sign-out card and did not get the chance to tip his masseuse.  We may try to come back for the same folks who treated us so very well, but the gatekeepers will make this a difficult task indeed.  With so many hotel spas to choose from in Vegas, the MGM may need to review their policies.
3 For such a large hotel, the spa is relatively small compared to others on the strip.  It's adequate for a good workout for those that want to stay in shape and burn the Vegas calories off.  Everything is standard here in the locker rooms, steam room, sauna, whirlpool, lockers, showers, and lounge.  The lounge is really small, and can feel cramped if there are more than ten people in the room.  Nothing really stand out at the spa, which is kind of surprising considering how much I like the MGM.  What I don't like about the Spa is it's location.  It's all the way at the end of their shops, so if you come out all relaxed and in your bathing suit or robe, you have to walk all the way down the row of shops amongst a throng of tourist looking at you.  You'd think they'd make a private passage from the elevators to it somehow.
4 Customer service: pleasant representative when booking the appointment over the phone.  When arriving for the appointment, the person working the front desk could be a little more patient (especially since there was no one else in line and the phone was not ringing).  The receptionist in the actual spa area was friendly.  Massage: I got a full body massage, which was very relaxing and I appreciated that the therapist concentrated a little more on my upper back and shoulder areas at my request.  Soooo comfortable.  Rest of the spa: -The jacuzzi is nothing special -The dry sauna is nice -The steam room is kind of scary, with steam so thick you can't even see and green-ish lighting -They offer water, juice, tea, granola bars, magazines, and newspapers in the sitting area  If I didn't get a massage and only went to the spa, I would only rate this place 2 stars.
4 My comments are only about the Cristophe salon...  Every time I am in Vegas I get my eyebrows waxed by Gina .  She is the best.  She is the only person I have found who can wax eyebrows with no plucking afterwards.  $30 for an eyebrow without plucking is well worth it in my opinion.
3 I agree with many of the reviewers in that the facilities aren't quite up to those at Mandalay Bay's spa or at the Canyon Ranch spa at Venetian, but there are some good things about the Grand spa: lots of snacks (granola, fruit, juices, teas, endless bottles of water), an abundance of cold towels, and some good treatments (I had a good facial and a less impressive Fijan body scrub).  I find the services a bit pricey--as much as all the top places on the strip and perhaps not quite as good. One thing to note is that the Grand Spa adds a 20% service charge for every treatment. Just something to keep in mind!  All that said, because I'm staying at the Signature this summer, I'll be going back to the Grand Spa in August. I'll update this review then to give you all the new and improved details.
2 Ive seen better spas. For Vegas and the size of this hotel, the spa is SO SMALL and NOT worth it. One medium sized jacuzzi, tiny steam room and sauna. Relaxing lounge area. Im a spa junkie, and this place is only good if you are not willing to go outside of your hotel. Its OKAY. The services were eh. My sisters express facial was useless, a bunch of stupid creams. My moms massage was not the best and her manicure service was friendly but BASIC. No spa-ish treatment. NO hang massage, perafin, luxury kind of things. For $45 dollars, this manicure should have been AMAZING. My scrub and massage was good.  NOTE- REMODEL. Needs to be bigger. Doesnt stand a chance if there is a spa like Qua at the Ceasars palace around. Im going there next time because its worth spending a little more to go there.  Average/good prices but still not worth it.  LAST NOTE- The front desk lady was HORRIBLE. Whats with the attitude? She didnt look at my face when she was talking to me and that was uncomfortable. She was rude. Ew. Negative energy at a spa should be banished.
4 WOW!! I went here for a spa. I had a massage done. OOOOOoooo i'm loving it. I'm so relaxed and plus i fell asleep. Who falls asleep really fast??? I got the classic swedish massage. Loved it. I came out and i was feelling really good. I didn't really want to leave just yet.   They had everything there. I loved the atomsphere. Me and my girls didn't go in the jacuzzie because ppl were in there naked. Ewwww. What happens if they have something. LOL.. hahah Who knows right.   But other than that, i loved it. Ck it out if you stay at MGM...
3 I do love the spa, but my pocketbook keeps me from going as much as I'd like.  Well, we robbed that piggy bank with this visit!  I met my two best friends for a lil' Vegas weekend and since we arrived early in the day before our room was ready, we decided to spend the day at the spa.  My sweetie had stuck a card in my suitcase with some cash to put towards a service and I used it all plus a little more.  I ended up selecting a 50-minute Zen Stone Massage totaling $204 (including tip - which they calculate at 18%).  I know it's Vegas and it's a resort, but I still thought it was overpriced.  My masseuse was April and she did a great job.  The stones were nice and hot and it was a very soothing experience.  It's a massage with light to medium pressure, so if you really like to be worked out, then this is not the massage for you.  The facilities are nice with the typical amenities: sauna, steam room, whirlpool, showers, lockers, vanities, water, and snacks.  Compared to other spas I've been to, I thought it was average.  There wasn't anything bad about the experience and there wasn't anything that stood out either.  I will say the robes were super comfy and nice to lounge around in.  Gigantic, but comfy.    My girls and I will have a great time no matter where we are and it was nice to be with each other, get settled, and get a little pampering and R&R on the first day of our trip.  If I had extra money for spa services in the future, I might go back if I was staying there, but I would probably be more inclined to check out a different spa next time.
4 I would consider myself a fan.  Granted, I normally always stay at the Signature and I go to this spa for convenience's sake but here are the high points that made me a repeat client:  1.  They will squeeze you in and I am totally fine with going in during non-peak hours.  Less busy and more quiet time.  2.  Nice, breezy entry way and a tucked away location.  Noise pollution was not a problem for me.  3.  I liked their amenities and thought they stocked up pretty well.  There are even disposable toothbrushes that come with their own toothpaste!  4.  A scrub specialist that I did not even have an appointment with took the time to ask how I was doing while I was lounging in the jacuzzi.  She was very sweet, loaded me up with lots of bottled water and told me her name.  I only wish I remembered it because it was such a great personal touch that I would definitely be pleased to get services from her in the future!  Low points:  1.  The receptionists were not as friendly as I would have liked and did not seem to be familiar with the spa menu of services.  2.  This is a huge, multi-purpose spa and could easily get that over-crowded, I'm-just-a-number feel.  3.  The waiting room could definitely use a larger variety of refreshments.
3 Yes, the facilities are pretty nice and the staff is kind, but we're in Vegas, and if I'm paying to go to a spa, I want some top-notch services.  I got the french manicure here, and I was not impressed.  My nails had already chipped by the day's end and within the next day or two, the top coat peeled off. Although the ambiance is nice and the private room they take you into will not smell like acetone, I'll endure the loud Asian women and chemically smell if that means a better-looking manicure for a cheaper price.
4 The spa itself is ok, the jacuzzi was, warm not hot, and the lounge area was mediocre , but I specifically went to this place to try the shirodhara treatment. I own a spa myself, and have been thinking about offer g this service. I had it done by O'Neil , and it was... Out of this world. his hands are incredible. I am a massage therapist for 15 years, and have had tons of bodywork. After a few minutes my jaw relaxed, and he hit every trigger point on my neck and scalp! You rock dude!
3 Let first say that this was my first spa experience. I enjoyed the time I spent there, but it was a bit unexpected. Maybe I am stupid to think there would be a sense of privacy in a spa this damned expensive, but there isn't. The first thing they warn you about is that this is clothing optional, but they don't warn you until you get in!!! Knowing that my money allowed me to see the grossest peep show ever is a bit disturbing. Seeing old people nekkit is nasty, PERIOD.   Anyways, maybe I'm over-reacting a bit. The massage was wonderful. They were running a special on a "wine down" massage. It was full body and lasted 50 minutes for $100. I signed up for a couples massage with my wife. The experience was very relaxing. The tables were warmed, clean, and comfortable.   The bottom line? I probably wouldn't pay this much for a massage again in my life, but if the price were more acceptable I might try it again.
4 Loved my spa experience here.  Got a manicure while my sister in law got a pedicure.  We had the same technician so we got to both go to the room and she soaked her feet and relaxed in the massage chair while I got my nails done.  I went back the next morning for a facial.  I love my facials but always procrastinate in getting them done because I hate paying the cost.  But the basic european is only 125!  Most places in the bay (for a spa facial with extraction and microdermabrasion) cost upwards of 180 and beyond.  And I definitely got a facial in june that cost more than this one and was not as good.    And the robes!  Softest comfiest one I've ever worn.  I wanted to take it home with me.  The relaxation lounge can definitely get crowded when people are waiting for their appts.  I really enjoyed the facilities and if you get anything done, you get full use of the spa until 8pm and can go in and out.
3 As an anniversary gift, the bf surprised me with a "COUPLES 50 Minute Swedish Massage."  Of course I was super giddy since this was the first time we'd ever received a massage together AND since I was in badly need of a relaxing rub down.     Since we were staying at MGM, their own spa was obviously the most convenient choice.  The spa is located in the direction towards the pool area, but to the left side before the escalators/stairs leading directly outside to the pool area. We arrived an hour early, as suggested, to take advantage of the spa facilities while waiting for our massages.  As soon as we checked in, me and the bf were whisked away to the separate female/male areas....                                                    ***LOVED*** -THE RAINFALL SHOWER HEAD. Love it, love it love it!   I took a shower before and after my appointment and loved the way the water (from this very large and circular shower head situated directly above me) encompassed my entire body with a steady stream of warm water. It was totally relaxing and yet energizing.  When i buy my own house, even if its a rinky dinky house, I'm definitely installing a rainfall shower head! -The WHIRLPOOL. Tucked away in its own area I managed to relax here without any interruption or disturbance from anyone else.  FYI, this spa is also a 'clothing optional' spa; so with my newfound sense of relaxation from the amazing shower, I whirlpool'd it in my birthday suit.  -The QUIET LOUNGE AREA.   Has plenty of comfy couches and a few lounge couches. with a table full of magazines and snacks and drinks (chilled water, fruit juice, granola mix, and fruit. I bundled up in the robe provided to me in my locker and easily knocked out on the comfy lounge couch while waiting to be called.                                                  ****************   My female masseuse soon came in to the sitting area calling my name.  I was led to the outside check in area where I met up with my bf and his female masseuse.  FYI, upon making massage appts you are given the option of either a male or female masseuse.  We were led to our treatment room which consisted of 2 separate massage tables. We were left alone to remove our robes.  Again, we had the option of either removing or leaving on underwear and with that our 50 minute swedish massage began....                                                   ***SO-SO*** -THE MASSAGE.  Our massages were mediocre. After our time had ended and we were alone in the room getting dressed my bf said his wasn't as great as he was expecting it to be, which was true.  There wasn't enough intensity as I've felt from other swedish massages that I've gotten at other places.  It was unfortunate because of how expensive a massage in any quality Vegas hotel can be.  We joked that  if we had been left alone in the room, we would've been better at massaging each other since we already know each other's preferences...or we should have asked for male masseuses.                                                  *****************   Afterwards we were led back to the separate spa facilities and told that we had free access to it for the rest of the day.  With that, me and the bf spent another hour at the spa.  I immediately took another shower under the amazing rainfall shower head!!!
3 If I could give another half a star I would.  My husband and I went to MGM grand for our anniversary, and I wanted to utilize some spa facilities.  I booked us a couples massage.  The massage itself was fine, but it was a little strange to walk out of the lounge, take the elevator to the second floor, and then go into the room.  But that might just be me.  We had our appointments in the morning, and the spa allows access all day to use the lounge, whirlpool, sauna, and steam room.  Plus star for that!  However, in the ladies locker room, the steam room was out of service.  Minus half a star for that.  My husband and I used the facilities after our massage (separately), and before going out to a show, I figured I'd go back and get my money's worth.  The only thing that keeps it from a solid four stars is that the spa itself didn't feel like a relaxing, soothing environment.  The doors in the lounge are very heavy and distracting, so every time a therapist would open or close the doors, it would make a lot of noise.  Not relaxing.  The services are definitely pricey, more than I would normally pay - hence, my reasoning for going back and forth into the whirlpool and sauna.    Not sure if I would go again.  But definitely convenient for staying at the MGM.
1 A friend booked us for hot stone massages last week.  I'm a girl with a traditionally, male name, so we made sure to tell them at booking that Cody is a female.  We arrived around 30 minutes early to check in.  They charged up-front for services and were thoroughly surprised I was female, having booked me in the men's spa.  They assured me everything would be fine, and showed us into the waiting room.  We waited for a few minutes, and then they came and got my friend for her massage, right on time.  I waited. And waited. After 20+ minutes, which I now realize was too long, I went to speak with them about why I was still sitting alone in the waiting room.  My fault for waiting too long...on the other hand, for $170, I shouldn't have had to speak with them.  They asked me to go back to the waiting room while they "figured out" what happened.  I returned to the waiting room for another 10 minutes or so before someone came to tell me there was a "misunderstanding" and that they were sure they could start my treatment shortly.  By that time, my friend was 10 minutes from being finished with her treatment, so I told them to forget it.  The front desk girl then "offered" to refund the money. For the service I didn't get.  For leaving me sit for 40 minutes and wasting my afternoon, I would have liked a little more.  Even just a manager apologizing, rather than the front desk girl's offer to rebook at a slightly discounted rate in the future.  Not impressed.  On the plus side, they did have 4 different celebrity gossip magazines in the waiting room, so I was able to catch up on what Lindsay Lohan is up to during my 50-minute wait.
2 I'm wondering if the positive reviews were mostly from those that have little experience with spas previously.  I'm a fan of Burke Williams Spas so I thought this Spa at the MGM (esp. with the hefty price tag for services) would be, at the very last, comparable to Burke Williams.  I found the facility to be very small although they tried to squeeze much into a small space.  The staff that greets visitors and provides the tour are dressed like pool side staff.  The lockers actually were stocked with wire, yes wire, hangers such as those given by the local cleaners.  The changing room had a few complementary toiletries but no cleansers or lotions.  In all fairness, the massage was pleasant and comparable to what I am used to.  However, a day at the spa is an expensive luxury, and the atmosphere is part of the total experience.  After spending a few hundred dollars, I was very disappointed.
4 We had a couples massage here. She had the male and I had the female masseuse which was a nice touch.  Both of us enjoyed the massage. Both were above average and the massage room was clean and comfortable.  I stayed and used the men's facility. A very nice hot tub and sauna. There was a complete line of toiletries available as well so I could take my time and be completely ready for the day ahead.  $300 for a 50 minute couples massage and day-use of the facility.
5 Enjoyed every minute of my facial with Ae. Ask for her! she personalized my facial, gave a relaxing massage and I could tell she knew what she was doing.
4 My frist spa experience ever and I am FAN!  I was treated to the "Dreaming Ritual" and it was amazing. The treatment started with a foot scrub. I got to choose 1 of 3 oil as my base for the whole treatment....after that I got a full body scrub. Next came the mud wrap...while I was wrapped I got a scalp massage...after I got rinse down and off came the mud I got to lie down again and got a full body massage. That massage totally helped relax me!!   This being my first spa experience....it will be hard to top this because it had a little of everything.  $350 for 2 hrs and the the use of the spa facilities for the rest of the day  AMAZING!
2 My family got treatments here this weekend and it was a lovely spa. The check in staff was nice enough but we were informed upon checking in that tips were already included on our bills and we couldn't remove them. This kind of turned us off and we inquired about canceling our appointments... they have a 2 day cancellation policy which I think is excessive. So basically we were forced to tip our technicians the amount that MGM wanted them to be tipped, which I didn't think was all that awesome.  The spa is split into a men's and women's spa but all of the treatment rooms are shared - private, but shared between the two spas. They're well appointed with steam rooms and a large jacuzzi for each one. My dad got a deep tissue and said it was absolutely fantastic. My sister and I got manicures that were good but not worth the $160. We got them on Saturday and it's Tuesday and my polish has almost entirely chipped off! My tech used Seche Vite for the top coat so I know it wasn't that, but she had the balls to dilute the polish she was using on my nails with acetone in front of me... something that makes polish chip. For $160 mani/pedis I thought that was a really crummy way to handle your materials. My technician was sweet though and the actual manicure and pedicure were good. Just bring your own polish and know it's going to be overpriced. Overall I've had better for the steep price but I'd probably go back.
5 I had an amazing massage, facial, and full use of the spa. I didn't truly know what an authentic spa experience was until I came here. I felt like a Princess pampered in luxury.
1 I had visited the Grand Spa some years ago and had a wonderful experience.  This past November, I booked a massage and facial through the concierge prior to my trip.  I was contacted so that I could provide my credit card number to book the services.  I was told there was a 2 hour cancellation policy.  When I arrived, I received a written confirmation of the second scheduled service, the facial. but not the massage.  In the early morning hours of the next day, I contacted the concierge about the fact that I had not received confirmation of the first service and received assurance that it was scheduled.  So, I went to the spa and checked in and sat waiting for my massage.  I was not called at the appointed hour and when I went to the desk to ask they told me the massage had been booked but not placed on the schedule.  I didn't want to wait around for the facial and was quite irritated by how I was treated by the manager.  She refused to refund my money for the facial.  I went to the concierge and was told that it was a "glitch in the system" and she couldn't do anything to get the facial refunded.  I explained that had the concierge TOLD me in the morning when I called that the massage was not on the schedule I would have cancelled the facial within the 2 hour limit.   The concierge repeated told me that there was a glitch in the system and she was sorry.  In no uncertain terms I told her that a glitch in their system is not my problem.    A few hours later, I received a call advising me  that the full amount would be refunded and there would be no spa charge on my credit card.  No charges came through in November.    HOWEVER, when I got my December AMEX statement they had slipped the charge for the facial back onto my card.  One month later.  After telling me I wouldn't be charged.  DO NOT PATRONIZE THE GRAND SPA AND IF YOU DO CHECK YOUR CREDIT CARD STATEMENT  CAREFULLY.
3 Nice-looking spa, but it didn't blow me away. Had a spa pedicure. I guess for the price, I was expecting something amazing.
5 OMG...the best facial I have ever gotten. It included a hand and foot massage which I fell asleep to. The ambiance is relaxing to a point where I literally fell asleep in the dark room waiting for my facial. I went in an hour before my facial to relax and take advantage of the spa. Totally worth that decision. The whirlpool jacuzzi relaxed my tense muscles. I even sat in the steam room for a bit. By the time I left the spa I was refreshed and relaxed. Well worth the price.
4 I'm no newbie to spas so I had an idea of what to expect when heading out to Grand Spa to have a relaxing day with some friends.  For the use of the spa for the day I paid a $25 entrance fee (it might be less during the week). I had full access to the gym, jacuzzi, sauna, steam room, and relaxation room. I took full advantage of all of those facilities. It was definitely worth what I paid.  The gym is fully equipped with weights, exercise balls, & treadmills, etc. One thing that I really liked was that they had a tray with headphones you could borrow if you didn't have any, which are a MUST for running, at least for me. They also had a tray marked as used for after use of the head phones.  The sauna & steam rooms are a bit small and can get crowded with as little as 4 or 5 people.   The relaxation room had a television set with a couple of comfy couches. They also had water with orange slices, fruit, as well as trail mix for you to indulge in as you relax.   The HIT of the whole spa for me was the jacuzzi. It was great for my body after my workout since they had a couple of strong jets. They actually offer cucumber slices and towels for your use right next to it. I definitely loved spending some time relaxing in there.  Two of my friends received back/neck/shoulder massages. According to them, this service was either a hit or miss depending on the technician you got. This turned me off from going back to this specific spa if I have a spa day in Vegas again.
4 I received my first spa experience here. I was really pleased at how they were able to fit me into their schedule on such quick notice. My mother called and they told us they had time to fit us both in. Ten minutes later when we called back, it was all full! How?? But anyway, they were able to fit me in for a 25 minute back, neck, and shoulder massage with an aromatherapy add-on.   The front desk area is very pretty, with orchids and mirrors everywhere. You walk along a sunlight filled hallway and find yourself in front of the salon ( it looked very posh). Inside, at the receiving desk for the spa, the lady was very nice and offered us juices, coffee, etc there. She gave us a tour of the facility, and situated us with a locker, the key, and everything we would need.   They feature a huge jacuzzi, a steam room, a dry sauna, a relaxation lounge, and a quiet tv area.   My mother had a hot stone massage that she really liked, and she looked so smiley after, that I was so happy I had dragged her away from the slot machines for a few hours in the spa. My head, shoulders, and back massage was okay. Next time, I will opt for a longer massage, as this one was too short! I let my masseuse know that it was my first massage, so she walked me through it and was very reassuring. I was expecting lavender or chamomile, but she chose lemon. She didn't even ask me for my choice - she just assumed since I was young, I'd like lemon. Wrong /: Anyway, she told me I had to drink tons of water to cleanse out the toxins. She was so great for a first-timer!   God, I loved it. Everyone there is simply looking for relaxation and pleasure, so people mill around finding exactly that. All the patrons are nice and respectful of your privacy.   However, there were some people who were loud and disrespectful. I understand, some girls want to gab away when they have spa time, as they so rarely get a chance to be together. However, there is no need to yell your problems - I don't need to know about your bachelorette party, and how much alcohol you drank last night. Please just let me enjoy my spa time... Everyone wondered why employees didn't ask them to quiet down to a whisper, at least.   And, ladies in the relaxation room : I didn't need to listen to you talk about your mansions and your pool. Be courteous, and don't ruin it for the rest of us.   You only have to pay $25 if you want to enjoy the spa facilities without a massage or facial. The facilities are included at no extra charge if you do get a massage ( thank goodness. )   There are countless water bottles chilled in things filled with ice, and a separate one filled with iced hand/face towels with chilled cucumber slices. There's an abundance of fluffy towels offered through the place, and many, many hampers where one may dispose of their used towel. In the lounge area, there's chilled water, apples, and granola bars set out, to eat to your heart's desire.   There are only a few stalls in the restroom area, which was an annoyance, but most of the time, there was no wait. There are also a few showers there, as well, completely stocked with shampoo, conditioner, shaving utensils, and body wash. I didn't like how their showers flooded, though /: The shower head was heavenly, though - it felt like I was standing in the middle of a warm, soothing (pounding) rainstorm.   True to the person who gave us a tour of the facility, you could really live in there! There are snacks, countless waterbottles, toothbrushes, toothpaste, face wash and moisturizer; mouthwash, cotton balls, q tips !   In the locker area, there's a salon area complete with straightening irons, blow dryers, hairspray, and tons of other things ! There's so much stuff there that all you need is your own makeup. Everything else is already provided for!   Ahh, heavenly. I can't wait to come back again, this time for the full 50 minute aromatherapy massage!
1 The men's spa here is not that great. To me it was nothing more than a men's locker room. They tried to fancy it up, but the furniture was broken. There were dirty towels all over the place. The robes were tattered and left black lint all over my body. They had Right Guard on the counter for their product of choice. The toilet stalls were what you'd get at an airport. They play the sports channel really loud in the "relaxing area." When I first walked down the cobble stone path to enter, i had to scurry out of the way for an employee pulling a metal flatbed trolley which I found the noise quite ajarring. Also while in the "relaxing area", this huge clunky door with the metal push bar across the middle with an ugly bright industrial 'Exit" sign above it was constantly slamming open and closed with the female spa attendants poking their heads in calling out pages for their clients. And the men in the spa would break out into loud, random, scripted, nonsense discussions as there were no signs posted to be quiet or respect the Zen nor did the attendants do anything to quiet the place down. I have never been more annoyed and unrelaxed in my life. I will never go back to this spa. Skip this one for sure!
4 I had some free time before meeting the boyfriend and decided to run to the Grand Spa.  All I wanted was a workout and some relaxation.  This was perfect.  $25 gets you a day pass.  You get to use the women's locker room which includes locker, amenities, jacuzzi, steam room, sauna, and the gym.  The gym here is great.  They have fantastic cardio, some nautilus, and free weights.  But they also have medicine balls and the body bars I love to use.  The few times I have been here there have only been a handful of people so there is plenty of room.  They have bottled water and granola bars as well as towels and headsets if you need them.  The steam room was nice, plenty of water, and the attendants were great.    For $25 I got a great workout and relaxed before getting ready to hut the town.  Highly recommend it,
1 Had a pedicure & manicure here -$200! I had such high expectations for this & was so disappointed. Started out not having the color I picked from the gel sample. Then she didn't even paint all the way to the edges of my nails! And then no hand massage! She basically gave me a blob of scrub & told me to rub it into my skin & wash it off! I was so disappointed!  I hoped the pedi to follow would be better. Nope. She was so rough cutting my cuticles & no foot massage either!!! I was not happy! The polish on my big toe chipped by the time I went back to my room. I don't recommend this service at all. I'll also be calling to tell the spa how disappointed I was. NOT worth it....I get a better mani/pedi at the local salon I got to!
1 CRAP service. Charges to my credit card for services never received. Called a b**ch by some twit that worked the desk, NEVER, EVER heard an apology from anyone that worked there.    Plus......It was very EXPENSIVE!!!  and I do mean expensive. And, they add tax, gratuity, etc. So a $95 pedicure ended up being $114. Seriously?!   Will NEVER, EVER, EVER return. Save your money, go off strip, or wait till you get home. Simply NOT worth the money.
2 If not for the amazing massage I received, this spa was a HUGE letdown.  The MGM should be ashamed of the lack of upkeep of the facility in general, and the maintenance was just awful.  The first thing I think about in a spa setting is serene cleanliness.  This place could have used a scrub brush, mop and mildew remover.  The grout in the hot tub was filled with mildew, had missing tiles, and some bouyant brown substance floating in the corner.  So I decided to move to the other side of the hot tub, looked over and saw mildew literally hanging from the deck nearest the filter.  I decided to get out.  Next stop, the sauna.  Definitely clean, but when I went to sit down the bench swayed (granted, I weight 150) and then a woman tripped on a loose slat walking out.  Made a note to self:  skip the loose slat on the way out.  Decided to visit the steam room just to check it out.  One look inside (wet towels EVERYWHERE -- benches and floor!) and decided it was no bueno.  Okay, how about a shower before my massage.  I guess it would have been okay -- clean towels, well stocked, and generous stream -- except for the hair floating in the drain and all over the walls.  I mean, was there anyone working that day?!?!  Okay, into the lounge to wait.  Water bottles, towels and blankets strewn all over the lounge chairs.  Crumbs in the chairs.  Maybe I should just leave.  Maybe I just expected more.  I decided to stay and finish up with my massage.  Enter, the saving grace!  May made my entire visit worth while.  She was friendly without being intrusive (I have when they talk through your massage!), and had the hands of an angel.  I get massages once per week and have to say this was the most relaxing ever!  Would definitely go back to see May, but won't arrived early for the "amenities".  Management, this is Las Vegas for goodness sakes -- clean it up and make it special!
5 I have a fear and loathing of spas. Usually, they're frou frou because they cater to women, which is understandable. The men's section tends to be either exactly like the women's section which means unless it's a site for RuPaul's Drag Race - all men hate it. Or, it's nasty, fungi filled and neglected populated with sketchy characters who show an unseemly interest in you.  This was the wonderful exception: masculine, clean, sketch-free, well-supervised, and relentlessly kept clean and stocked.  I like a good schvitz. I'll alternate with cold showers. No cold pools here: just a large and clean hot tub. A nice cold tub and a bar would be nice.  I came in as a walk-up and asked about a massage. Crazy. No appointment, strange city? But, luck was with me. I met Steve who is this towering Titan of a man who belongs on the front of a bodice ripper novel.    I have long standing issues that require a lot of physical strength. Man, this guy has it. He's pretty fearless. If you say you can handle the pressure: he's serving it up. He's a solid family man, too. Yes, that matters. Las Vegas might be "Sin City", but when you're sending someone you love off for a massage - send them to a place and professional with high ethical values.  There are now two men I trust to give me a massage: my man back home,  Massage by Marc, and Steve.   The young men who supervise the men's section were a delight. I confess complete defeat with the lockers: I had to ask them to open mine twice. They were cheerful and charming.
3 I always try to keep my fitness in gear when traveling on biz.  Vegas with all it's sinful temptations of food and drink can ruin it for me so I always try and hit up a casino gym while staying there. The Grand Spa at MGM was a decent little gym with some nice equipment. Very well kept, plenty of cardio, and a good line of machines, dumbells, and some cable equipment. Also on hand are complimentary bottles of water, fruit, and assorted Nature Valley granola bars.   Hours: 6:00am - 7:00pm Monday - Thursday, 6:00am - 8:00pm Friday - Sunday  Overall, nice gym for a casino with plenty of equipment. $10 a day gym only fee is a deal.
