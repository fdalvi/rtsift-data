5 Great value for pizza.  Clean looking store and amicable staff.  Taste better than frozen pizza and most carry out.    The other review is a joke and not helpful at all.
4 Perfectly okay pizza
5 The best pizza I have ever had, the chicken bacon artichoke delight is to die for. The staff there is already friendly , fast and the place is clean.
4 Pretty good service and the pizza is a great value.  We are happy with this location.
2 Pizza is what you should expect from Papa Murphy's. Staff is not. Call in to order they sound like they dont want to talk to you or be there. Ordered a pizza wanted a second but they didnt care. Just wanted to know when I would pick it up. Gave them 45 minutes. When I arrived I had to wait an additional 20 minutes and I arrived when I said I would. THe staff just doesnt care.
