4 Apparently, eating a Chipotle Burrito, Chocolate Milkshake, Matzah-Ball Soup, two Pickles, and a Gummy Pizza all within 5 hours can get you Food Poisoning.  Who knew?  So, the next day after a few hours of making out with my beautiful toilet sink in the bathroom at the Venetian, I call down to the desk an asked for a doctor.  What, they don't have in-house doctors.  That Dr Vegas show with Rob Lowe was so full of shit.  No wonder it got canceled after like 2 episodes.  So, they tell me to walk past Harrahs to a medical clinic.  I somehow manage to crawl there, only to find Carnival Court and no doctors anywhere in sight.  I get a cab and they take me to Harman Medical Clinic (conveniently located near the Hardrock Hotel and Casino).  Three hours, 2 bags of IV fluid, and a shot in the ass (literally) later, I was all set to go sleep again for about 15 more hours.  Cost me about $100 with Kaiser.   So, next time you're in Vegas and do some serious damage to yourself (but not enough damage to warrant an expensive hospital visit), check this place out.
4 After reading the other reviews we were skeptical about even going; long waits and bad care seem to be part of the scene. But Vegas offers few choices so we went. It was a very positive experience!! We got right in, the staff was efficient, the doctor was wonderful and the cost was not outrageous. I would reccomend this facility any time you need care.
5 This place took really good care of my wife after an allergic reaction to some oysters. They are located right behind Planet Hollywood and the staff was very accommodating. I would definitely recommend it. Very good nursing staff, the interior is nice enough and they actually seemed to care about the patient.
