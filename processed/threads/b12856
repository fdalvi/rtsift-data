1 um, is no star an option? this place was so beyond terrible it's humorous. have you ever been to Rocky Point? you know, where they outfit their bars on a shoestring budget of $80, place cheesy plastic beer flags everywhere and have lights that point down at the floor and move jerkily back and forth seemingly in an effort to make you dizzy?  yeah...that's this place. like a time and physical warp to spring break rocky point circa '99 --- ow, ow!!!  not to worry, I'm sure it will be something else in about six months anyway. it was bar/band venue for a second, then it was PA Connection... (wait, why does Tempe need a connection to Pennsylvania??) and now it's the Coconut Club. maybe their trying to channel the success (for lack of a better word) of Margarita Rocks with that name, but it all spells greasy dudes with bad lines and bad music.
1 Yeah this place is pretty bad. Hillarious crowd, dudes wearing Tupac spraypainted on there shirtz, multiple nfl patched jeans, etc. I've seen a couple people get kicked out, its good times. If you are a big fan of Souja Boy, this is the place for you. That song hits like every other jam. And in between most likely either "in da club" or Usher. Thats right, Usher. Bottom line, if you have to come  here, get really drunk. But do it beforehand because drinks are a bit pricey.
1 Horrible food, worse music, inattentive staff and overpriced drinks. No wonder they closed.
