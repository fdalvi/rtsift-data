4 It's rare that I Yelp somewhere that's not lovably local. Even more rare that I have something nice to say about FedEx. But I do. Because Nancy rocked my socks off today when she packed my goods and got me out of there quick, cool and collected (usually I'm cursing having ever step foot in a FedEx, but those are all on the West Coast... maybe it's different in the Midwest?).
4 Although when I got there, the package I'd come to collect hadn't been dropped off, I was given very good service and further information. All 3 employees working greeted me when I came in. Well done.
1 When I was finally helped, the employee told me that my package (to be picked up) was not at their location, even though I had called ahead to confirm that I was going to the correct location. Additionally, despite having a tracking number, she was unable to help me find which location the package was at. She informed me to try the location down the road (she said that she was pretty sure it was there), which it was, but I didn't enjoy the wild goose chase.
