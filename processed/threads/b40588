5 Being new to this state, I can honestly say this is the best eye doctor and I made a good decision coming here. They took the time and patience to help! I am forever grateful. Also, there are many styles to choose for glasses!!

5 I needed eye specialist for my daughter on a Saturday.   I didn't want to go to urgent care ir emergency room as they are not specialist in diagnosing eye problems. This office was accommodating. Everyone was pleasant and proffesional. This doctor took time to diagnose but ended up referring us to specialist for further evaluation. She is carring doctor with excellent bed side manners.  We came back for an eye exam and glasses. It took only half an hour to have glasses done!
