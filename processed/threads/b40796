5 Been here twice and got compliments on both haircuts.  Highly recommended.  Will definitely be back.
5 I just moved to Mesa and I'm so glad I found a great stylist so soon! Dorian has cut my hair twice now and I've gotten great reviews both times. I highly recommend her! She takes her time and really tries to give you the best cut for you.
5 I tried this place out of the blue and I've been going ever since.  Had my hair done by two different people here and got excellent results both times.  They are incredibly friendly and you feel like a friend when you walk in.  Good priced mens cut, definitely worth the drive there.
5 Found MY NEW Stylist.   Actually found this salon when I took a wonderful friend  who had started losing her hair because of chemo to get her head shaved. We walked in this door and they were so gracious and lovely to deal with and showed such compassion that I couldn't wait to come in for me.  They did not disappoint.  Love my cut and color. I highly recommend this salon and their staff.
