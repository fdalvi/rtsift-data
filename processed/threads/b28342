4 Great staff and service. They take care of their part and make sure everything is running smooth and the facilities are clean! (major plus)  Personal lockers provided next to your bunk which is super convenient. Plenty of shower stalls and spacious bathroom area.   The downstairs lobby is a cute, chill area to lounge as well as the upstairs kitchen. This hostel went beyond my expectations for my first time at a hostel.
3 Great staff, clean hostel. If you get a room with fewer beds, the price is higher but easier to get to sleep in. My first couple of nights was in a 4-bed room with an in-suite bathroom, and met some really nice travelers and so had a great experience. The common room in the lobby has free wifi along with coffee drinks and snacks. The chill room upstairs has a pool table, couches, and a large screen TV but it's hard to chill when every time I went up there it seems someone was watching South Park at full volume.  The location was pretty convenient to Old Town sights, food, and markets.  I decided to stay there for one more night before flying out instead of making the trip to the airport from St. Andrews in the wee hours so the morning of my second stay, I went to Art Roch to reserve a bed for the night and was told there were plenty of beds available but when I returned that night, my reservation had been lost and was relegated to the "emergency room" - this was a windowless room with no ventilation and just down the hall from the outdoor smokers table. Apparently, this is where other hostelers whose reservations were lost also ended up. Smoke kept coming in from the outside all night long as well as loud discussions from the smokers making sleep impossible. This was despite house rules that the outdoor smokers' table was not to be used after 11:00 p.m.   Based on staff, location, and amenities, I would have given it 4 stars if not for the lost reservation and horrendous emergency room stay.
5 Très sympathique auberge de jeunesse, en plein old town, dans le quartier de GrassMarket. Pour faire simple, cette auberge est vraiment très bien située. Nous étions logées dans un dortoir de 8 personnes. Draps, couettes (incroyable), serviette de bains sont à dispo dans la chambre. Les lits, les draps, les espaces communs sont très propres. Nous sommes très bien accueillis à notre arrivée, on nous conseille, nous écoute.  Pour 5 livres, le petit déjeuner est servi dans en pub en face de l'auberge.
