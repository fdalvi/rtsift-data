5 Okay-I hate going to the dentist as much as anyone.  That's why I have chosen to make it as miserable for them as it is for me.  I berate them every chance I get.  For example, no matter what, I always wear a red shirt when I go to my dentist.  "It's so the blood won't show" , I tell them. If I am feeling particularily naughty I will eat Oreo cookies prior to my cleaning. Afterwards, while looking into a mirror near the technician (and hopefully within ear shot of other patients), I will boast, "Wow you got all the black crud out of my teeth!"  Please note; You may substitute a pulled pork sandwich instead. They also have DVD players at each station so you can watch a movie while your teeth are neatly removed.  I like to watch "Strangers with Candy" while I am in the chair.  This way I can  see someone who has way worse teeth than me.  Poor Jerri Blank. Bottomline is that they are really nice here.  They laugh and have a good time while you are under the lights getting drilled on.  All in all, good people and nice office.  I have been going to them for almost 20 years!
5 This place is great!  The dentist has an awesome 'bed side' manor and I just love the staff. Friendly and fun makes visiting the dentist a LOT easier. I have had some really bad experiences with previous dentists so I really appreciate when I find one that doesn't hurt me or push me through like a number. Finally found an office I can stay with!
5 I have been coming to Doctor Clifford since 96.I would not trust anybody else with my teeth.The staff is great, Linda and Brooke are always a pleasure to deal with.
