4 I must admit that I hate shopping. I get especially stressed out during the Christmas season. There's that delicate balance in my universe where I don't want to break the bank but at the same time knowing that I am being judged for an eternity by my wife on the gift that I choose for her.  This is where Michael Kors comes to the rescue. My daughter once again helped me with this gift idea (see my Tiffany's review) as we brainstormed over the phone. We finally settled on a purse which my daughter emailed me a picture off the website. So I went to the store with a picture in hand which made the transaction very painless, except for the visa charge.  At first, I thought I entered an exclusive nightclub. Because these sales ladies where all dressed up and looking fine in their evening wear. The salesperson even was walking around with the purse to give me an idea on what it would look like. She also tried to sell me a bunch of other stuff too. But I told her I wasn't prepared to deplete their entire inventory in one trip. They gifted wrapped it in a very nice box and a fancy bag. I wouldn't hesitate to return to Michael Kors in the future.
4 This designer shop lines up with lots of luxury designer shops along the air conditioned corridors of Fashion Square.  A friend asked me to scout the latest of Michael Kors' bags.  Got some lovely choices for her.  But it seems that the staff is commissioned.  That makes for an uncomfortable, subtle kind of salesperson aggression during any visit.  ew.
5 Great customer service.
