4 The second Popped location has opened up at the corner of Hualapai and Twain in Summerlin, convenient for fans like me who live in the area.  I've been to the Henderson location a few times, but having one this close to me is so much more convenient.  The location they had at Town Square is closed, too.   Open seven days a week, from 9:00am-7:00pm, come here for free samples and friendly service.  I snagged small bags of the Cinnamon Toast and Marilyn Monroe (white chocolate and coconut), and got a free small mixed bag with purchase for the grand opening, as well,  an offer good until 7/15/14.  Welcome to the neighborhood!
4 Thanks to Terri R., I know this place exists and they sell wonderful popcorn, something I don't usually buy.  Since I was going by today, I stopped to give it a try.  I bought a small bag of Hot Stuff which is described as orange cheddar and jalapño and a small bag of La Famiglia--parmesan cheese, garlic, and onion.  I also got a small, complimentary bag of their mixed flavors.    I tried some of the mixed flavors and I had to open the Hot Stuff.  At first, I didn't think it was very hot.  Then the afterburners kick in and you taste the jalapeño.    While I may not be stopping here often, their product is great!  I wish I could get popcorn like this at the movies.  And I'll end my review the same way as Terri--welcome to the neighborhood!
