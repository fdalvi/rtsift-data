4 We came to this little bakery, after having  breakfast/ lunch at Taco los Compitas right next door.  I mostly get pastries with pastry cream at Mexican bakeries, I've tried the great looking conchas and other breads and cookies and find them hard and dry, for my taste.      I mostly point and ask "crema" if they say yes I usually get it..  We got 2 of the rolls with crema and it was overflowing with goodness.  We also got a couple of pastries  with cream cheese filling the crust reminded me of shortbread cookies which I love and the cream cheese filling tasted like cheesecake another favorite of mine.     We also got a slice of tres leches cake it was a pretty solid rendition , white cake with a white frosting  .             All this for $6.50 :) , we will definatly be back , especially for the cream cheese thing . FTR, Yes !!! snooze you lose Carol K lol
4 Mexican pastries always seem to be a bit more dense than I usually like.  This place has the usual, empandadas, pan de huevo "egg bread", cuernos de azucar "sugar horns", cookies of all kinds, and then I found something that looked like a long puff pastry, filled with creme, I think it might be called a taco de pina?  It pulls apart in sections, loaded with creme, and very light.  Loved it. We made a few selections, and enjoyed them all.
5 I love pan dulce. I have not found a better panaderia in Vegas yet.
