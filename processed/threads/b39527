3 Yum. Very healthy and fresh. The potstickers were delicious. My only complaint is that they are always out of white meat (chicken). Not sure what that is about. LOL  Wanted to update the review...I tried the boba here and it was terrible. Way undercooked. The service isn't too great either.
1 This place closes at 9:30 and I went in at 9:00p.  Came here to grab dinner to go. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR FOOD FOR TAKE OUT! Got two chicken bowls to go. Got our stuff but it was COLD. We asked them if they could do something about it. They cooked us some new chicken and we left.   Get home and one of the bowls had raw chicken! Pieces of the chicken are raw and sitting on top of the veggies and rice. That's totally unacceptable. I've never had this happen.   Now they're closed. I'm out the cost of two bowls. What am I to do? Wait until morning to talk to someone?   I get it. Places close. But who ever cut the chicken surely noticed.  They need to fix this! They need to have some quality control. Use a thermometer for the meat.  It's just a lose lose situation.  I ended up stir frying the veggies and chicken at home in a pan and nuking the rice.  I understand it was a 30 minutes until closing. They should have just told us they were unable to make any new chicken correctly for the night and sent us elsewhere.   I hope they get inspected.  I don't post bad reviews for the most part but I am doing so in hopes that no one gets sick.  I will not return but please be careful if you choose to.
3 Second go round, we used the drive up window. Order was short 1 yaki soba bowl...I called and a girl said she would tell someone I would be getting it tomorrow...um we shall see how that goes...  Hubby got sweet and sour shrimp, which he had last time as well, but he said he didn't like the sauce this time. Also had the chicken daily special, he liked that.  Friend had oriental chicken salad, it was ok. She also had chicken daily special.  I did not have anything, my order was not in the bag....lol  The first trip we tried the Mongolian chicken, never again....seriously Crab puffs were really good! Steak and broccoli which was ok  So I still want to try the yaki soba..lol
1 Food is great but they honestly have the worst service and are so unorganized! It's 11:20am and I order a Chicken Teriyaki Bowl with brown rice and a Thai Tea Boba and five minutes later one of the cooks is telling the cashier to ask if we want to wait because the brown rice isn't ready. Then another 5 minutes later I get my order and ask about the boba and was asked if I can wait another 5 minutes because the gel is cooking. Seriously?! Get your shit together! Never coming here again! I'll just stick to the one near my house on Eastern and 215!
3 Teriyaki Boy Healthy Grill has a good variety of chicken, steak, and seafood bowls that definitely satisfy your hunger.   Unlike most Asian fast food places, they offer good generous servings of rice or yakisoba, which I appreciate. I also love the flavor of their Green Tea smoothies with boba in it! Delish. Another thing, one time I had their steak yakisoba and the steak was super tender, it was awesome. I've also had their shrimp teriyaki bowl, which was good as well. Their food definitely tastes great.  The reason I only give them three stars is because for a fast good spot, this place takes such a long time to complete orders. We ended up turning off our car while in the drive-thru one time.
5 I was a little apprehensive cause it was healthy terriyaki and even though most teriyaki is usually made with rice but because I'm on a low carb diet and can't have any rice. It was made with all vegetables and it was rather large and really good.
2 I love teriyaki boy, i'm all for healthy food, good portions sizes, greens and bobba teas. But for some reason the meat and chicken sometimes taste undercooked :/ and I was so excited about them opening a location next to us.
1 I've been to this restaurant several times and last night was awful. First off the workers do not speak English. They messed up my order and then made me feel guilty because they had already started what I didn't order. I agreed to take it and it cost me more $$ than what I originally wanted. The won tons were super greasy and undercooked. When I called to complain and asked for a manager they told me no manager was there and hung up on me. I tried calling back and the phone was off the hook. Worst customer service ever. Save yourself the frustration, don't eat there.
5 I discovered this place on my way to my Dad's house. They had me at healthy and teriyaki!   What a menu! They have rice, soba noodles and all kinds of meats and fish to pick from. I ordered the chicken and steak soba bowl. I also ordered their edanama and an egg roll. The soba bowl came filled with chicken and steak. It also had loads of veggies which made me extra happy. I love their teriyaki sauce cause it isn't as sweet as traditional sauces. The egg roll was tasty and grilled instead of fried. I also liked the bowl of steamed edanama.   They really do live up to their name. They have healthy food that tastes amazing and for affordable prices. I wish they had one in my neck of the woods.
4 It is good it is not bad but the second time they put a lot of teriyaki sauce. And to me when i was done i felt to mush salt. So you should but a little less teriyaki sause. Love the food but to mush sauce.
