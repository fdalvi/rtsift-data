1 My sister and I were driving around Buckeye looking at, good question, what were we looking at? All that looking made us hungry and being one in the mood for Chinese we spotted Great China. We parked and walking in to the place, it was a buffet, not something I usually choose but we decided to give it a try. Now mind you this is not an old restaurant but the booths and chairs were torn and warn as was the table top on the particular table we sat. The food was truly horrible, limp and flavourless. It was so bad we were laughing on our way out. What crossed my mind while sitting there and eating or pushing my food around was watching what I can only figure was the manager sitting at a table doing what might have been paperwork. I thought, look up man and see what you do not have here and change it. Another one of them thar boggles I get every now and again.
1 Gross.  It was really pricey for not good food.
1 Went on a Friday around 4 in the afternoon and it was all but empty. Some happy hour. Anyway, the Mongolian beef may have actually been horse meat, maybe rabbit. It was nothing I've ever tasted , but definitely not beef.  The appotizers were the kind you buy frozen and drop in the deep frier, and even for that genr√© they sucked.  Oh, and it was dirty. The table clothes had stains from their crappy sweet and sour sauce all over them.  I am always looking for good Chinese - I didn't find any here.
