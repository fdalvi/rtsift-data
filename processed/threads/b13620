5 A few years ago, my wife randomly chose Neighborhood Vision Center to get our eyes checked.  Since that time, I have been quite happy.  First, the customer service is unrivaled even by some of the doctors I have had in Chicago.  After the typical battery of exams, my favorite part begins...picking my new frames.  I never choose a frame without doing the "Gaby" test.  Gaby is the office manager and she's got a really good knack for finding those frames that work well with your facial features, complexion, etc.  She and I are usually on the same page when it comes to picking frames for my wife and myself.  For instance, my wife and I both have Silhouettes,  Michael Kors, Oga, Jaguar, Nike (Sunglasses), Theory (Sunglasses), and other high end frames.  They also have a very extensive selection of sunglasses by Bebe, Juicy Couture, Nike, and others.  Besides Gaby, all of the office staff is a delight to work with.  I periodically bring my glasses back for adjustment by Rachel and she does a very thorough job in adjusting them.
5 this is the best eye care I have found. I was very used to the big cookie cutter, nobody cares places so it was very refreshing to get someone that cares about YOU.
5 I had always gone to Target or Nationwide for my eye care, but recently a good friend recommended I see Dr. Kent Kneip.  Completely different experience all together.  The technology used in my eye exam was incredible, I actually got to see what my eye looked like on a good sized monitor which was amazing.  The exam took about an hour, nothing was rushed and procedures were explained.  The Dr. is pleasant, soft-spoken, and thorough.  I had a comfortable and relaxing experience with him.      Then I got to chose glasses!!!  With Gaby!!!  Boutique-style and pampered with a professional and fun opinion catered to my style and needs.  Gaby made my time there super fun and I ended up choosing sunglasses and everyday glasses in my prescription.  I have a high prescription, so in the past my choices for cute glasses were very limited.  At Neighborhood Vision I tried on 20+ pairs and Gabby helped me take my time and narrow it down.  I was never excited to pick out glasses until I came here.  I am compelled to write this review because I feel like this office is a hidden gem in Gilbert.  I had an amazing experience and will definitely look forward to going back every year.  They have so many brands of edgy and fun glasses, I need to make more money so I can have many more pairs :)
