1 I have never been a customer of this company but the drivers are the worse !!! I was stopping on a red light on Craig & 15 and this pair of drivers starting taking pictures of me with their cell phones and laughing and staring at me, I just felt so bad, I am a 30 years old mom with 3 kids (inside the car) and they acting like this, really ??? I just hope anybody in managment read this review and talk to those guys. Truck # 77 with a black number in the back 2041. This was on  08/01/2012 3:05 p.m.
5 One of the most fantastic moves I've ever had. I've moved 6 times in the last 10 years and this was by far the best. The guys were courteous, hard working and friendly. They truly cared about my items and my home
5 I just move from Reno to Las Vegas with Puliz moving and storage. They were very customer friendly and handle everything with extreme care. Definitely will use them for any future moves.
