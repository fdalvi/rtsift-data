3 Grade: C-  The most over-rated restaurant in Madison. Decent food. Outrageous prices. Good service. How this place is still in business amazes me.
5 Love Delaney's. Impecable service. We always go there on special occaisons and are never dissapointed. The food and service is top notch. Not many places left that have the level of service and the quality of food they have. The onion rings are a necessity when we visit. Keep it up Delaney's, you are my favorite steak house.
2 I have to echo the other two reviews for Delaney's. We had heard from some that this was a great place for steak so we tried it. I will say that our steaks were very well done, juicy and delicious. The atmosphere and service was stuffy and rather cold. Our baked potatoes and salads were simple, plain and dull.   The experience is not worth the price.
5 This is the best steak house in Madison, hands down. The staff is absolutely fantastic and the owner is often on-site. I have never had a bad meal--in fact, I've dined here several times and have always been impressed with the quality of the service and the food. It is pricey, but worth it. St Pat's is an especially great night and there corn beef special is all up scale but at affordable rates.
5 We've had an excellent and welcoming experience each time here.  The steaks have been cooked to perfection, the waiter was extremely helpful and prompt, and the experience has always been pleasurable.  The price is high and the ambiance is a bit old school.  We continue to use this as one of our favorite places to celebrate special occasions or to have a good piece of beef.
5 Discovered this place via hotel recommendation.  Was traveling by myself so sat at the most enjoyable bar with nice people (staff and customers) and had a terrific filet and an over-the-top wedge salad. Asked for grilled asparagus as a special item - no problem.  Excellent wine list and by the glass, and good music.  I will visit this friendly place again.  A winner if you are on the west side of Madison.  Sit at the bar.
4 I really like Delaney's. It has a quiet, intimate ambiance perfect for a date or special occasion. Being a little less dressy than some of the other steak houses I've been to, it's a little more relaxed, which is a plus in my book.  The small dining areas keep you from having too many people, and their conversations, around you. Two servers per table help to keep things moving in a timely fashion.  Then there is my favorite, the Ostrich Wellington. It's actually an appetizer, but it's kept me coming back for more since the first bite. Well worth a visit just for this.  Maybe even try their homemade Tiramisu for dessert...
5 GREAT STEAKS!!!  Excellent Seafood!!!  Awesome service!!!  I was craving steak and was ready to give up on the food scene in Wisconsin when one of my colleagues recommended this place.  I came out of that place with a big smile!!  I had the ribeye served on hot metal plate to keep the sizzle.  It had a crust that steak lovers crave!!  It was cooked beautifully at medium topped with seasoned butter.  I also had the Seafood Bisque and had chunks of crab with every bite.  The seafood seems pretty fresh.  I saw a neighboring table with a huge seafood appetizer with crab legs, ceviche, colossal shrimp, mussels, and maybe other stuff.  I wish I would have got that if I had more people in my party (it was meant for more than 2 people).  Service was friendly and prices were average for a steak house.  Steaks were $30-$50.  I would go here again and would recommend to anyone looking for a good place to eat in Wisconsin!!
5 I went to Delaney's with my future inlaws and my partner. I enjoyed every aspect of my experience. From the extremely friendly staff (especially Michael (?) and Rebecca), the wonderful ambiance, and then the food. I had a somewhat spiritual experience with my steak. At one point I swear it hopped of the bone and into my mouth it was so wonderfully prepared. Service was excellent, prices were close to reasonable, and overall, I would recommend this place to anyone.
4 A friend/co-worker of mine graciously agreed to care for my cats and dog while I was on vacay in New Orleans; to repay his generosity, I offered a trip to the restaurant of his choice, and he selected Delaney's.  The last time I'd visited Delaney's was in the late 1980s. I was in high school and was a guest of my employer, Dick Tarnutzer, from the Lake Mills Cleaners/Dells Auto Museum. We had a table of like 20, and if memory serves correctly, I had a burger...  Fast forward 25 years, and in terms of ambience, not much had changed. The dining areas were still small, compartmentalized, and quite intimate. Service was 100% old school; the maitre-de placed napkins on our laps; a bus boy filled the water glasses, and two servers took care of us throughout the night.  Tap selections were limited to just five offerings: spotted cow, capital amber, guinness, lake louie apa, and tyranena bitter woman.  We ordered an amber and an APA, then cruised the menu.  Brews arrived after a short wait; followed by a half-loaf of a very dense wheat bread.  Waiter returned to share info about the specials, but we were there for one reason: steak. I ordered a 6-oz fillet, medium rare, with side salad and roasted veggies (hey, a guy's gotta' watch his girlish figure, right?); my pal ordered the bacon-wrapped fillet, a side salad, and hashbrowns.  Apparently, all of the steaks come with a potato option and your choice of soup or salad.  I'm happy to report the salad is legit - it had a slice of hardboiled egg, two slices of red onion, croutons, carrots, and a few tomatoes.  The raspberry vinagrette (served on the side) was delicious as well.  The steaks arrived and wow.  Wow - they were fantastic. My medium-rare fillet was perfectly cooked and was bursting with flavor. I'm not gonna' say it was as good as what I could conjure up on the Green Egg, but it was quite solid.   My order or roasted vegetables (tossed in balsamic) were superb. Big chunks of carrot, zucchini, onion, and bell pepper - all were flavorful, and served as a fine companion to the meal.  Service remained excellent throughout the night; perfectly attentive without being over-bearing or inattentive.  The check was more than reasonable, given the two entrees, five drinks, and a dessert.    Delaney's = WIN  Food = 4 stars Service = 4 stars Value = 3.5 stars MISC = 4 stars  A solid, old-school, it's-all-done-right-steakhouse/supper club.
4 5/2/2013 at about 4:30 PM.  We heard about this place (word of mouth and YELP) and wanted to stop in for a drink and dinner here before heading back to MKE.    Our first impression upon seeing the location is that it looks like a ranch style super club.  When we walked inside, we saw a large, bright (still daylight and lots of windows)  retro-lounge bar area.  We sat down and had graciously poured cocktails with our entertaining and very funny bartender (whose name I never got, darn it!).    After imbibing, we checked in with the restaurant host and were seated (5:15 PMish) in a three or four table, dimly lit nook area of the restaurant, separated from other similar areas of the restaurant.  It felt quaint, cozy and a bit romantic in there (see the picture).  Appetizer:  Crab Cakes; two to the order ($12.00).  Though small, they were definitely house made and excellent.  Entree:  TBone Steak ($37.00):  Good sized. Excellent.  Ordered medium rare, the steak came out with a wonderful crispy char and was outstanding in flavor and tenderness.  Our other order was Chicken Oscar ($28.00) which was also outstanding.  String beans instead of potato was good - possibly steamed and tossed in a light butter sauce.    Dinner was preceded by salads that were fresh and crisp.  One of us had the raspberry vinaigrette that was obviously home-made (not bottled, at least).  Dinner service was provided by brother team Mike and Tom who provided us with good service.  I definitely recommend this steak house.  It will not disappoint any steak connosieurs.
4 Great food and service at a recent visit.  This used to be a regular stop for me when in Madison.  But a few years ago I was disappointed with the steak so I never came back again and instead tried Tornado Steakhouse. On this recent trip, my co-worker wanted to try the prime rib special on a Tuesday for $25.  He said it was the best stop we had throughout our 5 day stay in Madison.  I did enjoy their cedar-planked salmon.  Lots of flavor and not too greasy.  Way better than the one they serve at Tornado Steakhouse.  Thank you Delaney's!
5 Overview: A quasi hidden icon.   Hits:Reliable kitchen, service, staff, and bar - - to the point of telling you that you will dislike something based on your personal tastes if you visit enough.  Misses: Lack of marketing given how great they are.  Hints:  Sit  in the bar for a more relaxed evening - the high-tops can easily accommodate a full dinner service.
2 Not the best dining experience. Would definitely select Ruth Chris or Flemings instead.
2 10/7/2013 After all the reviews, I had high expectations.  The bartender was pompous. The steak was bland and pan seared?  The potato lacked the garlic they we're suppose to have.  Finally the vinaigrette was too sweet. Not a good restaurant.
5 My new favorite place to take the wife out.  I ordered the 18oz prime rib and it melted in my mouth came with baked potato and salad.  Wife had Alaskan king crab it came perfectly cooked and split ready to eat. It was great ambiance and not rushed. Our courses came out perfectly timed and wait staff was very professional and well trained.  Hat's off to the Delaney's for a wonderful experience and a great meal. We will be back for another date night soon.  Coming from a culinary student, it is a place I will model my performances after.
5 This is an excellent steak house! The service is top notch and the food is outstanding.
5 My husband and I stopped in Delaneys after an early movie a few weeks ago.  We went into the bar since they were just setting up for dinner in the dining area.  The bar tender was absolutely great!  He recommended a Chardonnay that was so delicious.  We decided to have the onion rings as an appetizer with our drinks.  If you have been here and ordered them, you know what a humongous amount there are on the plate...we at the whole thing!  We decided we were quite full on the onion rings and opted for an appetizer of ostrich Wellington and a salad.  OMG, the Wellington was so delicious.  It melted in my mouth.  The caesar salad which we thought would be a small dinner salad turned out to be a VERY generous salad.  The only disappointment was we were too full to have an entree.  But, I am excited to say we are going back for my birthday and this time, I am bringing my appetite to savor their great steaks.  We have been here several times and I can attest to the great service, great food which is consistent, and the wonderful atmosphere.
4 Excellent food.   Very nice atmosphere without being stuffy.  Steak is the obvious choice and it's a good choice.
1 Just left this place with my wife.  We went there based on these excellent reviews and we were very dissapointed.  In contrast to the overwhelmingly positive reviews, we found it to be very high prices for very mediocre food.  I had the lamb and my wife had the chicken and shrimp, both were edible but bordered on terrible to just plain bland (my wife had to put salt and pepper on the chicken just to give it some incling of recognizable seasoning).  Ive had much better lamb in gyros in our home town of Janesville that run around 5 bucks... so this lamb priced as a 35 dollar plate being far worse was quite a shock.  Avoid this place, and instead spend your money on one of the many great restaurants that surround it.
5 Great place...great people..great staff...The only place on Madison I will order a steak...absolutely wonderful!!!
