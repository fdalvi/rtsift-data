3 So we stopped here before our flight left at around 8 pm on Friday night.  The bartender was friendly.  They offered food from the neighboring Subway which was overpriced even for the airport.  The beers weren't priced badly.  My major gripe was that they had a full bar on a Friday night, and they closed at 9:00.  I couldn't believe it.  They were turning people away at 8:45.  Crazy to me.
1 Terrible service; waiter must be union
3 Nice place to hang out while waiting for your flight to be ready to board.  Good service.
