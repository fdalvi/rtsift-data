1 would not suggest renting from this company they care nothing about the property itself only that you pay they leave all the responsibility to the onsite manager of their properties a good example of this is their location on n 27th st off of indian school called la villa managed by some pretty good liars beware
5 Awful funny but I lived at a Peak Property since they took  over in  2009 and things are well taken care of! They have made the place gated, new roofs and fully remodel the units. Our manager is always on top of things before I even know it. Cell phone on 24 hours a day and he has even came to my unit which was my mistake at 3am! Our mangers name is Bill and this guy is great. Maybe we got lucky having him but we got a wonderful place to live and always clean.
1 I also would not suggest renting from this company.  This is the worst experience in terms of maintenance in my life.  Why would you leave a unit empty for four months and NOT paint it or fix it up.  It's obvious the unit was not painted as there are stains on the ceiling.
1 This is by far the worst place I have ever lived in my adult life. There is absolutely no communication here what so ever!!!  The water has been turned off twice this month with no advanced warning so far. And when I've called the office they are either clueless or they don't answer the phone at all.    The on site management is a very bad joke. He doesn't answer his door or texts when there's an issue.   If you want any peace of mind at all in a place you call home I strongly, strongly suggest you go elsewhere.
