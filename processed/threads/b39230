5 being a runner, it's all about training and races.  but races get expensive and training can get tiresome when you're not able to judge your results.  so i was quite excited when i found out that there was a weekly FREE and TIMED 5K i could run held by the very popular Park Run group.    the edinburgh park run is great, it's a mainly flat course that has a lovely scenic view out to fife running along the Crammond promenade.  it's completely run by volunteers which is amazing as this has grown from just over a hundred runners to almost 400 runners weekly.    it's easy to sign up online and all you have to do is arrive before 9:30am to get behind the start line with your barcode for scanning later.  the marshalls positioned along the track are great and really encouraging as are all the runners that attend!  it's a friendly and fun environment that's great when you want to gauge your time but not be in a race.  i've only been 3 times, but i definitely will keep coming back to watch my times (hopefully) continue to improve!
5 Free, timed runs and a note of your PB (personal best) - what is not to love!  As Alex and Robyn have noted Edinburgh's parkrun (always little p) takes place every Saturday down at Cramond promenade. Toilets are open from 8am and there is free parking if you arrive sharpish.  Intro talks are given for newbies and you need to register online and bring your printed barcode so you get your time texted/emailed and registered by parkrun. As Alex noted you can join the 10, 50 and 100 club with regular parkrunners wearing their milestone t's with pride.  Its a friendly bunch with people cheering you on as you slog it out to the finish and a decent flat run. If you are travelling, your barcode can be used at any parkrun so just check your desired location on the website to see if there are any runs that week.  Well worth checking out if you like running for fitness or are training.
