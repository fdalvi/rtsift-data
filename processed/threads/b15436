4 McDonald's drive-thru is the girl who's in her pajamas and in for the night but decides she wants a Manhattan and realizes she is out of ice's best friend. $1 for an 8 lb. bag (2 for $1.50) and you don't even have to get out of the car!!
2 This is the worst McDonalds i have ever been to. (period)  Actually I go there quite often, and every time I have been there the food always has dries up particle of mustard ketchup and other food items. I don't think i have ever been inside this restaurant and I'm 99.9% sure i never want to.  I went through the drive thru and some "est√∫pido extranjeros ilegales" were deliberately switching mics and speaking Spanish then switching back and laughing while trying to take the order.
2 This place is more miss than hit, I stop by here for breakfast on rare occasions and the food usually comes out more than slightly mangled.    The food is usually edible and the customer service at the window is always friendly.  I've never had the experiences that Phoenician C has but I will admit that this can be one of the lower end McD's that I've been to in this town.  Curse you McGriddle!!!
1 Another filthy Mc nasty. The ice machine had no ice and and the girl taking my order seemed pretty slow and there was a ton of purple smoothie on the counter where I placed my order. So I asked the manager for some sauce besides ketchup for my fries and he states the sauce is usually .15 and acts like he's hooking me up...I tell him we're even for the ice situation. Anyways, with the playland in its current condition,  this place is doomed to be an accident waiting to happen.
