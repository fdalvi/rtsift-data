4 Had a great experience with the staff there. They are friendly and are great at what they do. Doctor really takes interest in your personal concerns and does her absolute best to address them.
5 This was a great experience last minute appt. Very Bad Tooth Ache the kind where u can't catch your breath. Spoke with Stacey at 10:30 she got me in at 1:30 met Dr.Reddy who was compassionate n gentle. Within 4 minutes tooth was out !! And I was on my way home. Dr.Reddy is my new family dentist and my Kids. Looking forward to getting back on track with my Dental Health.
5 I always feel I get the best care on the planet at Ocotillo Family Dentistry  In 2009, I started a quest to track down Dr. Suneeta from her previous office because I felt she was an amazing Dentist.   Little did I know I would find her even closer to my house than the previous office AND with a staff of professionals that absolutely blow my mind with their service.  I am 100% confident in the care I receive here. I never feel rushed, every important aspect of my dental health is communicated to me with NO B.S. (in other words, they never try to get me to spend money on things I don't need) Dr. Suneeta is meticulous in her analysis of my needs, (she even saved me from possible disaster when discovering a previous root canal had the potential for infection and thereby referring me to a quality endodontist for correction).   I don't particularly enjoy dental care, but Dr. Suneeta Annamareddy and the entire staff from the front office to the dental hygienists absolutely make it as delightful as possible. I recommend them to everyone when the topic comes up. Thank you Dr. Annamareddy for being so awesome and thank you to the entire team over there for always being top notch.  Also, thank you for the referral to a great periodontist. You guys are amazing.
