4 They were friendly and helpful.  We had just moved to town and were able to set up our AAA accounts and do our title & registration for the car.  We even walked out with a license plate!
4 Thank goodness for AAA. We signed up so that our son, a new driver would be covered- just in case. And boy have we gotten our money out of our membership! Plus I love getting the movie tickest cheaper there!
5 So worth it. I was really scared after a major blow out and Chris was very understanding and nice. He followed me to discount tire and even helped me back my car out of a narrow alley. That's how shaky I was. I could not even deal with it. This is a great service to have.
4 I've been a longtime member of AAA but I didn't renew my membership last year, so it's been on my list to renew so that I'm not stranded on the road. Sadly, the AAA location closest to me in Scottsdale closed down, but I found my way to the Greenway location and had a very nice experience! The girl at the front happily helped me renew my membership and update my information. She also gave me a free North America Atlas (score) and a list of all the discounts and benefits for a Triple A membership. It was a very friendly and seamless experience and I will definitely return until a location opens up closer to me!
