2 Got a cheesesteak and regretted it immediately. The meat is tasteless and floppy. At least I didn't get sick!
3 Unbelievable find at the Las Vegas-NORTH food court. I always get my Subway, but decided to go a different route that day. To my surprise, this Las Vegas Great Steak & Potato was pretty good and super bang for the buck. I never really seen a Great Steak & Potato serve such a big sandwich. So, a LARGE great steak sandwich is $10, but it is like more than a foot long. So if you are resting your foot from a marathon day of shopping at the Las Vegas-NORTH outlet, you can re-energize with a LARGE great steak sandwich and order of fries. If you need more flavoring, you can sprinkle their extra seasoning.
1 Bad service with very bad attitude. We don't own anything don't give me a strange look.
