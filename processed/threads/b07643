3 Prob better to keep some things a mystery in your life.  Nevermind "WHY", -- whether it's trouble in romantic paradise and it beats the doghouse, or if it is more illicit things that are your forte -- but every once in a while, a person may find themselves in need of a roof over their head that is not their usual abode, or a seat under their butt that is not their usual comode.  When you would simply be throwing money away to pay for a bunch of amenities you will only sleep (or ?) right through, a cheap ass motel fits the bill way more appropriately than a posh resort.  Bell Hotel is a fine and adequate cheap ass motel.  Tidy and clean enough, properly stocked and seemingly well-maintained, considering this place has to have been there a little while longer than the 25 years I've known it to be there.  Just because you're in NoPho, though, doesn't mean you're off the hook watching your back vs. undesireables.  I mean, there is a Waffle House right around the corner, so, you know ...   Incidentally, they seem to have dropped their affiliation with the Best Western chain, as they no longer use the BW logo as part of their signage.  .
4 Great room, wifi was ok, great pool area, breakfast was included. Location was great (not far from Phoenix Downtown) and there are a few restaurants close
1 The best thing I can say about this hotel is that the staff was friendly. The hotel room wreaked of cigarette smoke and looked like there had been a bar fight resulting in a hole in the bathroom door. The breakfast provided was mediocre.
