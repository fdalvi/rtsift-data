3 Located next door to the 24 Hr Fitness I workout at, I've been to this location a few times now.  The lanes are very wide here and there is a convenience store.  However, the gas prices are above average and the car wash is a bit confusing....it says "Get a Car Wash for as low as $5"....yet, the Car Wash options shown starts at $6.......???  Unless I really need gas, I probably won't be stopping by here too often.  Return Factor - 10%
4 $0.15/ gal off if you buy a car wash. The basic wash is only $6, so, yeah, do the math:  if you get 14 gallons of gas and a basic wash, it's like getting the car wash for $3.90.  That's a win in my book ;)
1 Don't walk away from the pump at this station! I know you're not suppose to. But who doesn't run in for a quick cup of coffee or snack while you wait every now and then? The pump is suppose to stop automatically. Well not here. I saw a guy spend $107 on gas overflowing out of his tank while he was talking to the rude attendant. Bad day for him.
1 Skip this place. horrible derive
2 Skip this station if you can, they have the most expensive gas prices in the neighborhood.  I'm not sure if it's on a busy street, Scottsdale Road, or right by Scottsdale Airport, but the prices here are usually 10-20 cents more than the nearby stations.
