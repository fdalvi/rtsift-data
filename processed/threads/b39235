1 Silverscript Medicare Part D is basically a scam. For $29 a month, they advertise  prescription drug coverage with 0 co-pay and 0 deductible. When you try to buy prescribed medicines with this fake insurance, either they tell you the medication is not covered or they ask for a huge price. Does $104 for a tube of skin cream sound like 0 co-pay? For one of the most commonly needed medicines for seniors, the anti-inflammatory for arthritis, they offer only one medicine and one dosage, the 200 milligram  hydroxychloroquine, which happens to really be for malaria. Not a lot of seniors who bought this fake insurance need malaria medicine. The ones we need are not covered. The ads are lies.  I  doubt any real doctor would prescribe this for the typical senior with arthritis.  http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a601240.html#why
1 I complained to Silverscript about their false advertising. In response I got over 200 pages in three mailings of stuff I already had, and a letter that said, "Based upon our review, your grievance was due to your dissatisfaction with the level of coverage you have..." In other words, they drowned my well founded complaint in irrelevant paper. If you like idiot bureaucracies, you will love Silverscript. Just don't expect them to do as they advertise.
1 Do not enroll in silverscript!  I have had trouble with Silverscript from day one.  Although I met my deductible they claimed they had no record of my drug purchases before June 1. I told them I bought from CVS (their sister company) and to check with the pharmacy for my records.  They said they could not do that. Long story short:  I am into October and still paying full price for my meds.  Silverscript is the worst company i have ever dealt with.  Please look elsewhere.
