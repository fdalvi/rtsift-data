5 Ok So  These people make vegetarian dips, salsas, chips, and tamales.  AND THEY'RE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!!  They sell them at AJ's in the refridgerated section.  They're pricey and have black lids.  My personal favorites are the - pineapple mango salsa (so unique and refreshing, and sweet and hot all at the same time!) - the spinach con queso.  OH MY GOD IT IS SO GOOD!!!  So yeah. These people rocks my socks off.
5 I've recently discovered Vegetas hummus at Whole Foods.  It's the ones with the black lids.  I've tasted the Kalamata Olive and the Jalapeno flavors.  Oh my, were they good or what!  I really should try some other flavors but I have gone back two more times and got the same ones.  If you like hummus, this brand has to be one of the best out there.
5 Great Local Hummus (particularly the Jalapeno variety), I found it at the Tempe Farmers Market... Awesome stuff, I can't wait to try their other products!
