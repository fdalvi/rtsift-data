5 In the building with all the rest of the Phoenix natural medicine spots, corner to Lola/Pita Jungle.   Was greeted by super friendly people and encouraged to discuss what I like and dislike in juice so they could help me pick one. While I was waiting one of the other business owners popped in and was very friendly & encouraged me to take a tour of the other business.    They open much later now, around 9a, so I won't be able to come here often, but I think it's a great local business with good fresh juice!
5 Found this place on Yelp.  Was unable to make my juice last night for today.  So I stopped in for a juice from the Juice Bar.  I was greeted by a very nice lady that made my juice for me and gave me some great advice that I will follow.  I am so happy to have found this place.  Funny thing is, I have driven by this place 3 times a week for months and never stopped in.  So glad that I did.  I went about 9:30 and it appeared that they may have just been opening.
5 Very good. They know what they are doing. They sell loads of herbs too, if that's your thing.  I will warn you that if you park behind the building and try to go in from the south entrance, it is very confusing because it doesn't look anything like a juice bar. You have to go through the healing center to find it. If you go in from the main entrance on the north side, you will have no confusion.
