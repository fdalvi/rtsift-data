4 Convenient, reasonable prices, fairly cheap gas.  I really only go for the fountain drinks.. any size for 0.79 cents so it's a steal!
5 This is where we get "Big Drinks" 44oz for 79cents and workers here are super friendly.
3 I love the selection here. The fountain drinks are cheap, they have great food and soda selection. The gas prices are reasonable, but fair warning: all circle k gas in town seems watered down and doesn't last long.   The staff is where it is lacking. They have had a lot of problems keeping people. And it is hard to get a cashier that is friendly, fast, and helpful all at the same time.  Don't get me wrong there are some people that work here that are amazing people and love doing their job. But there are some workers and even managers that I have had problems with in the past big time to the point that I don't bother going to their register anymore or even acknowledging them unless I absolutely have to.
