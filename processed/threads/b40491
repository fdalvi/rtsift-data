5 You want a tattoo?   Go see Boston, great tattoo artist...  He can design anything you want!
5 Boston Rogoz is exactly whom I was looking for, for many years. Not only did I have an awful tattoo from my time in Korea in 1992, I am a breast cancer survivor.  When you are finished with all the treatments from breast cancer, the scars remain, and are a constant reminder of all that you went through. Not just the physical scars, but the psychologically ones as well. Both fade with time - but the physical ones can be rather unsightly, and detrimental to your psyche. Between the biopsy, lumpectomy, bilateral mastectomy, and then the reconstructive surgeries (x3) my boobs looked fantastic...when clothed.   After my mom died last October, I knew I wanted a tattoo to represent her and my dad. It didn't take long for me to decide that after 19 years, it was about time I did something for myself as well.   So...I have Swallows represent my parents, and the pink ribbon that they are holding follows the line of my scars. No longer are they red and ugly, and no longer do I feel as though I am damaged goods. Thank you Boston Michael Rogoz for your gentle demeanor, and for building a fort for my private sessions.
5 Boston was an awesome tattoo artist for my daughter's first tattoo for her 18th birthday! Another artist at another shop cancelled last minute, and with a few phone calls from another customer of Parlour 7, Boston came in on his day off to accommodate us. He was courteous and considerate that this was her first tattoo, and really went out of his way for us. The tattoo, a phrase, came out just as she wanted and healed just fine. The shop is clean, professional, and the other artists including the owner, were also friendly and cool to hang with during the tattoo. Thanks Boston and Parlour 7!
