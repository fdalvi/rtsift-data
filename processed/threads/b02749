5 Best oral surgeon ever! I have all these annoying and complicated dental issues and he has been patient and professional through years or surgery. His staff is knowledgeable and courteous and I never have to wait too long for an appointment. Surgery is scary but I completely trust Dr. Fish. Apparently others agree too as he always wins "Best Oral Surgeon" in Phoenix Magazine every year.
1 Rick W is correct; Dr. Fish is an excellent oral surgeon.  However, his office staff was very unprofessional, if not unethical.  My daughter needed her wisdom teeth extracted, and we received a referral to Dr. Fish.  At the first visit to the office, I handed my dental insurance card to the receptionist, and mentioned that I would like to have a pre-determination of my out of pocket expense for the work.  She said that costs would be discussed. After Dr. Fish completed the examination, he discussed the procedure with us.  I then asked Dr. Fish for a pre-determination of our out of pocket expense.  He said the finance person would discuss it with me.  A short time later, I was in the finance persons office, and again asked for a predetermination of costs.  She said that would slow down the dental work for several weeks, and assured me that everything would be OK.  I told her that I felt very uncomfortable not knowing how much I would be having to pay out of pocket.  To make a long story short, it turned out that Dr. Fish was "out of network" with our insurance company, and I was now expected to pay for the entire bill!  I had requested a predetermination of costs a minimum of four times, with three different people, and never received an answer.  Recently, I was told by another staff person at his office that the financial persons original notes stated that we were out of network, and she simply refused to divulge this to me at the time.  I would never have expected to be treated so unprofessionally by a doctors office.
2 Dr Fish is an ok oral surgeon.  However, his financial practices are shady.  He gave us a high estimate for surgery, 6k; we had to pay 4k before the surgery.  He then lowered the estimate after the surgery but refused to credit our card; we had insurance that paid 2k.  Two months later, we received a check for a small amount of the overage.  Their office person told me they dont do credit card credits.  I then called our insurance company and learned Dr. Fish had received $1800 more from us than the insurance co allowed in Dr Fish's agreement with the co.  Now we have to go fight him for the refund. His office person said, oh, insurance co's dont like to pay.  Hmmm--why contract with them then?  I would say, look elsewhere!
5 Recommended by my dentist, I read the Yelp reviews in the waiting room to get a sense of what awaited me.  **Begin aside.**  Have you ever bit your cheek.  Usually it becomes sensitive and grows back into your cheek.  My protrusion was not all that sensitive, and I kept biting it.  It kept growing out and I needed it removed.  This requires minor dental surgery.  That was all I knew. **End aside.**  I didn't know the cost, what the surgery would entail, nada. The waiting room seems to be about an average size and includes a fish tank.  The rest of the office includes a vast array of rooms.  I had a quick preliminary examine by Dr. Fish.  By the way, I was expecting a woman, but obviously Leslie is also a male name.  He gave me the diagnosis and treatment plan.  Next, I was ushered into another room and was told the price and the surgery was scheduled.  The price varied by the anesthetic.  I opted for the cheapest option, local anesthetic only.  Adding laughing gas was an extra charge, which means you are still awake, but a little loopy.  The third option was to be entirely knocked out.  In addition, the protrusion that was cut out of my mouth was sent to a lab for analysis to determine whether it was benign or malignant.  This was an extra charge, and I still don't know what the cost will be.  I arrived for my appoint still a little unsure of what was going to happen.  I had scheduled it for 7 AM on a Monday morning.  There seem to be set times for surgeries and set times for examinations.  By the time I was shown to my room, there were ten to twelve other people in the waiting room.  I had a nurse?? take my vitals.  I was connected to a machine that takes your blood pressure every fifteen minutes or so.  I was given a topical anesthetic to get the numbness going.  Dr. Fish came by and used a pinching tool to inject the rest of the local anesthetic.  Then we waited for the numbness to take over my right cheek.  Dr. Fish came in later, asked for another nurse, and started the procedure.  I could feel some punching from tools I assumed were used to keep my cheek open for cutting.  I saw some bloody on tools, but didn't feel any cutting.  Apparently, there was a smaller protrusion starting to grow next to the main protrusion, and Dr. Fish cut that one out as well.  It took under ten minutes.  After the procedure was over, gauze was inserted into my mouth.  I bled for another three hours and had to change the gauze every half hour.  After the surgery, I was shown to the recovery area that had alcoves with beds.  One women was asleep.  I guess she took option number three.  I was given a goody bag with the extra gauze, a prescription for penicillin and a heavy duty pain killer (I think it was percocet), and a pillow case.  I was also given the talk for someone with stitches in their mouth.  No alcohol.  No mouthwash.  No solid foods for a few days, and then keep it soft, etc.  I was supposed to come back the following Monday, but was leaving for vacation on Saturday, so I came back on Friday instead.  In the end, although I didn't know what to expect, everything went very smoothly and professionally.  Despite the reviews I read on Yelp, the price was explained up front with several options.  I also had to pay for the penicillin, (I didn't need the pain killer, just used some Motrin) and the analysis of my mouth tissue.  But such things are to be expected.  I could have refused to have my mouth tissue analyzed and prayed that it wasn't malignant, but I like sleeping at night.  I wouldn't want to have oral surgery again, but if I did, I would go back to Dr. Fish.
5 Dr. Fish is a very thorough and excellent surgeon! I did not even feel him put in my IV!! he is such a caring doctor and even called me the night I got my surgery done to make sure I was feeling okay. you will not find a surgeon better than him! I recommend him to everyone! Most of my friends got super swollen and bruised after they had their wisdom teeth removed and I am not even that puffy... seriously, Dr Fish is amazing  and has a great staff there to help him!
