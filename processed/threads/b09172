5 30 days until 50th and had this gift idea for kids. Thanks to Sarah at Anton we are getting a great lasting gift. Also their design for our 2 year old grand daughter is fantastic. And to top this we interacted with Sarah via the internet. As you can guess this is from and old far* who says these people rock.
5 T-shirts: I've had them design and print shirts for me.  Their artist was great. He really came up with a fantastic design and the shirts have held up really well after multiple washes.    Embroidery: We already had our logo for embroidery, so they just had to get it onto the hats and clothing.  We sometimes change the colors of parts of our logo (depending on what color the shirt is) and they always keep it all straight.  They helped us make the embroidery the right size so it would look good on the polos (we were going to go too small and after seeing it all done, they were totally right....they look perfect.)  We are very happy with all the orders we've had done here.
5 I have placed 20+ orders through Anton Sport for club shirts and other items and they have always surpassed our expectations. Always pleasant to work with, timely and professional. The product always turns out great!  I recently had a misunderstanding where we missed a few e-mails seeking approval for a shirt design from them, we needed the shirts for a meeting THAT NIGHT and it was 2PM! We approved the shirt design and they had them done by 5!   Absolutely incredible customer service, I'll be switching all of my printing needs over to Anton Sport.
