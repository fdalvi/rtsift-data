2 Hit and Miss!!!   I love the ripped java I add peanut butter!! So yummy when its done right!!   most of the people who work the juice bar are nice... one girl she is a which and looks like she is always having a bad day...  maybe she acts like that so you will want to go work out harder cause your pissed cause she was so unfriendly and rude...   I love the ripped jave and not having to run home all the time before the gym to make my own smoothie... but $7 gets a little expensive so I just treat myself a few times a week! :)   love working out at lvac 24/7 even holidays is awesome!
3 this place is great unless you come late at night.  the old guy that works there is super slow and unbelievably rude.
4 First of all, I love the fact that they are open every time I go to the gym, which can range from 2-4am.   I always order their paninis and wraps and they taste absolutely great! The one downside (which I knocked a star down for) is that I haven't seen any nutritional facts about their menu items. Not a biggie if you don't care about that stuff but I do. Another peeve I have is that sometimes it takes 10-15 minutes just to get a bottle of water when they're busy. But that's to be expected I suppose.   They do have an incentive program where if you activate (deposit into your LVAC card) with more money, they give you a free smoothie and more credit in your account. Lots of smoothies and food to choose from. They also have rice bowls and salads as well as pre-packaged foods like parfaits, sandwiches, and hard boiled eggs among others. They also sell protein shakes, pre-workouts, quest bars (yay!!), and jerky. Great after or before workouts!  Overall, very convenient place to grab a snack or lunch to go after hitting the gym.
