4 Good food and great service. Stopped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. Will definitely be back. They have a limited menu but everything on it looked good, I would definitely recommend them.
3 Stopped by for lunch a few weeks ago. The location is notorious for the changing restaurants, so I hope this one has better luck than the previous establishments. My mother and I ordered some ribs and a salad! The salad was okay, nothing to great, but the ribs were tasty. They had a certain kick to them! They were a little bit pricey, but their a hometown/small business so I don't mind paying the little extra.
5 Stopped in for dinner and didn't expect to be amazed but the ribs were amazing and the BBQ sauce was on point! I will be returning to satisfy my next BBQ fix.
5 Have eaten here a couple of times, and the ribs are awesome!  I would describe it as really good full service restaurant quality BBQ food in a counter service/quick service restaurant.  Great for a good quick dine-in lunch and would be awesome for take-out food for dinner!  Nice local family owned place, I eat here just about every time I'm in Casa Grande.
5 This is a store front steak and rib joint. Wow and wow! Loved the ribs salad and potato. Cute little dining area, the servers are so nice. My daughter had the ribeye excellent. Really didn't expect that. It's tucked away in a unexpected place. Glad I found it.
5 Ribs are fantastic!  So tender & the BBQ sauce is awesome...actually best BBQ I've had.  Restaurant is locally owned and no frills...just really good food!
5 One of the town's best little secret,  the ribs are too die for. The meat just melts off the bones. Heaven
