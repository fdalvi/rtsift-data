4 new place.  2 doctors and one assistant.  staff is nice and very clean inside.  good service.  some of my kids have had last minute needs and they have been able to get them in and take care of them.  beats hanging out in an ER for hours.
4 A review of their 'work in' program. From 1-3 they offer availability to see people without appointments - I came in as early as possible today and was the 2nd work in appointment of the day. I was told there would be some wait.  What I wasn't told is that there was going to be a 2 hour wait as I didn't even get into pre-doctor for 1 hour 50 minutes and didn't actually see a doctor for 2 hours 15 minutes.    The whole time in a warm waiting room the without any available water or food. Fantastic.  Total for this part of their program - 0 stars.  But beyond that process - The building is new - a doc and a couple of PA's work there - and a onsite lab. My doctor was Michelle who really was fantastic - it seems like she would sit there with me until i didn't have any other questions.  Didn't seem like i was a number to them, or just someone to rush through.  This part of it - i would say 4 stars.  So if you do go - have an appointment - should be better than my wait :)
1 I went here for a 3rd class flight physical. The facility itself is nice and clean, but that was about the only good thing I found about this place. The front desk staff was nice to patients, but I heard them saying rude things about other people. Additionally they were very casual about their demeanor and not professional. The assistant I had who ran my tests was not in a great mood and was unclear with her instructions. Dr. Germaine, although a good doctor, seemed very stern and needed to lighten up. He also seemed a bit unprofessional as well given he answered a phone call in the middle of my exam. Lastly, my wait time was over 2 hours for a simple 3rd class medical. The only redeeming quality about this, beside the facility was a good price, $75.
