4 People seem to love Sammy's. They have quite a list of salads and single-person-sized pizzas on their menu, among other items.  If you check out the photo on the website the place seems to have a nice, warm and cozy feel, but I didn't find that to be the case at all- at least at this location.  Instead I found the decor to be extremely faux and the hearth-like atmosphere to be superficial- no warmth at all for me.  But the space is clean and inviting, the food is good and the service was fine.  No real complaints.
2 Bad service, no knowledge of the menu, and the meat on the pizza had freezer burn. Good for a chain, but not the gourmet experience they strive for.
1 If you get the chance, don't eat there.    I had  the BBQ pizza - eh.  My wife had the chipotle cheese chicken tacos - which were disgusting to look at, never mind eat. The cheese was huge chunks, not melted and the colors of all of the ingredients were muted (not and adjective I'd like to use when discussing food).  Out waiter was just plain awkward - making jokes that were playfully sarcastic, but inappropriate for any dining environment - chain restaurant or not.   The experience furthered my belief that chain restaurants should be avoided at all costs.
4 Sammy's Woodfired Pizza in Henderson sits along the back of the shopping center that holds Joe's Crab Shack and Barley's Casino.  Walking in, I get the feeling that this is definitely a family kind of restaurant, where you spend a simple dinner out with the family on Sunday evenings.  We both decided on their pizza for dinner.  (But did start off with bread and butter, it's upon request.)  * Vegetarian Pizza "Grilled vegetables including eggplant, onions, zucchini, bell peppers and red onions with fontina cheese, roasted garlic sauce and roma tomatoes." ($9.95) - It was a good pizza, although I wished the garlic sauce was heavier, it was only faintly there.  Some mushrooms would make it that much better!  * New York Style Pizza "Our homemade tomato sauce with sauteed mushrooms, pepperoni, salami, and Italian sausage." ($10.95) - The Husband tried to order this with their Artisan thin crust for $2 more, but the waitress didn't really suggest it.  She said it was cracker thin, so he decided to order it as is.  It came out just fine, and the thinness was good too.  His pizza was saltier than mine, and definitely had more kick.  I overheard a couple of neighboring tables order this same pizza too. It must be a favorite!   Service was good.  The waitress refilled the Husband's soda without having to ask, although I could have used a refill on my water. She did come by and check on us and she was friendly, so we didn't really have any issues with service here.  3.5 stars.  They have a happy hour daily from 4 pm to 6 pm; at the bar only on Fridays and Saturdays.  Half-price tapas and house wine.  They also have a Tasty Bytes club.  A kids' menu is offered for those 10 and under, with items under $6 (and that includes a soda or milk).
3 Sammy's Woodfired Pizza is a reasonable choice for salads and pizza.  Also a good option for families.  I generally have had good service here, and this restaurant offers options that will appeal to a wide range of people - somewhat middle of the road - solid food and service, but nothing unique or remarkable.  The salads are particularly good in my opinion (chopped salad and green salad with walnuts, chicken and balsamic vinegarette) and they are large, a large salad can easily be shared by 4-6 people, a small by 2-3 people.  Pizzas are good but not spectacular - again - solid but nothing groundbreaking.  Some good options for variety here.  Good restaurant for families and kids.  Outdoor seating here is nice, weather permitting, although a bit loud as this location is right under the flight path from McCarran Airport.
2 We tried this pizza when they offered take-home valentines packages for $6 a piece. It was pretty good, so we decided to go in and eat. We fell for the fancy pizzas which for me were good but I wouldnt order it again, if that makes sense.  I ordered the Sun Dried tomato, with pine nuts and basil with goat cheese. Sounds a lot better than it tasted. I guess I expected it to taste as good as it did when we made it at home with pep & basil. Sometimes you just need to stick to basics. Surprisingly enough the salads everyone else in the restaurant had ordered looked way better than our pizza. If i go back I'd def. go with the salad.
2 I have visited Sammy's locations in California and Arizona. I am not sure if I forget that it was just okay or if there is a lingering hope that I will have a meal that changes my mind. But, alas, I had the same experience at the Henderson location. It was simply okay - a little bland, nothing special.  My husband had a pizza and the amount of grease on it and the plate beneath it was simply astounding. Now he eats a lot of crap and thinks that greasy is good so when he started soaking up the grease with a napkin, I knew there was a problem.   I had a Chopped Chicken Salad. The chicken was lacking flavor and the olives were so pickled that they made it difficult to taste much else. The other items on the salad - lettuce, tomato, mozzarella - did nothing to make up for the mediocre chicken.   We also shared the Garlic Cheese Bread. The seasoning was odd and uneven. So, some pieces tasted really nice and then other pieces left a bad taste in your mouth.  On the bright side, the waitress was attentive if just a little stand-offish.   I am glad that we decided to visit Sammy's when we had a coupon for a free entr√©e. Even with the discount, the food was overpriced. So, unless you are just visiting Sammy's for the Messy Sundae, find another pizza joint.
5 This is the best place ever !!! Other that it's a very beautiful and comforting place to come and eat pizza with your friends or family, it's one of the best places to have a birthday party for your child.I had a birthday party for my daughter and the staff was extremely professional and nice.Everything was ready on time, organized tables. They even helped us to entertain kids with doing messy Sundays . Kids had a blast ! Pizza taste great, fresh and hot . A lot of varieties.I would recommend it to anybody.This review is for a Green Valley location in HENDERSON .Manager is the best !
5 Very good gluten-options. Sammy's is a classy pizza joint with affordable prices. Join their email club and get free stuff. They usually feature coupons in the Entertainment Book.
5 Went to Sammy's wth friends that came to visit from out of town. We wanted to go to a quality restuarant without the prices The Strip has to offer. We landed at Sammy's Woodfire Pizza. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, we were catered to perfectly by the staff. Service, to me, is just as important as the food. I had the angle hair pasta and my friends shared a pizza. I tasted all that was present at our table. Everything was tastey and our served, Sean (?), was amazing. He filled our glasses when needed, he talked with us for a small time to get to know us and he made sure anything we needed was provided. I most certainly will be returning.
3 I enjoy Sammy's. It's a good, casual locals place. It's like a Chili's or Applebee's without the poor food and bad decor. And they have decent happy hour specials.  My three favorite things are the hummus (so yummy!), mac 'n' cheese, and goat cheese pizza.  The main thing here, obviously, is the pizza. And I have never been disappointed with any of the pizzas here.  The service has always been pretty good. And they've been quite accommodating when I've gone in with a large group.  The food isn't a culinary revolution or anything, but it's good.
5 I love the LaDou's BBQ chicken pizza, the balsamic grilled chicken salad and the messy sundae. They have an amazing tapa's menu with Baba ghanoush, duck tacos, chicken satay, etc. I have dined and carried out at this location since 2002. I have never been disappointed by the product or service.
5 The food at Sammy's is terrific. The woodfired pizzas are excellent, the pasta dishes are delicious, and even the more traditional items like hummus and kobe beef burgers are great.  They truly have something here for everyone. The service is always good even when they are busy.
3 Food is pretty good but the serve is horrible!
5 My bff and I were especially excited to find out that this place offers vegan pizza options. I'm not just talking about some dough with tomato sauce and a few veggies sprinkled on top...they have actual vegan cheese! The tasty kind that melts and all! The kind that you find on a freshly baked Whole Foods vegan pizza. Yes, very exciting indeed.  We went there for happy hour and some pizza a couple of weeks ago. We had the hummus as an appetizer and some red wine to compliment our meal. The hummus was quite delicious and warm pita bread with olive oil and basil atop was served along with it.   It wasn't very crowded, so the service was terrific and the servers were friendly and attentive. Liz(bff) ordered a margherita pizza and I ordered a pineapple pizza, both vegan stylie. We were on cloud nine. Needless to say, this is one of our favorite happy hour spots.
5 While the vegetarian pizza is my absolute favorite, save room for a nutty, fudge sundae! yummmmmmmm
4 I've been to this locatio several times and even though it's a pizza place, i have yet to try any. On most occasions i have split a sandwich and salad  with my wife. Here is what i have tried.. -Steak sandwich-grilled steak on a baguette with carmalized onoins topped with a mayo-mustard spread. Served with fries or coleslaw. Very tasty but a little expensive. -Fish Tacos. Pretty good for a pizza place.Slightly fried with corn or flour tortillas. I would get them again. -Chopped Chicken Salad. A nice mix of greens, chesse but the kicker is the kalamata olives, they really stand out. -Lobster Bisque- not bad, i'd say average. I am going back just for a sundae soon. Several tables got them around us but i've always been full.  A bit expensive but always something good to eat, very consistant.Was going to say 3 stars but the service has always been pretty good so four stars is accurate.
3 Duck tacos. Duck tacos. Duck tacos.  I know, it's a pizza place, but duck tacos are the only thing I order when I come here. I find Sammy's to be hit or miss most of the time. Besides this location I have also been to the one on Sahara once. However, I spent a birthday dinner at this location in Henderson a couple years ago.  Besides the duck tacos (I know I just confessed to only eating them) I have also had their pizzas. Well, of course I had to considering the place has "pizza" in its name. But alas, I have always come back to the duck tacos. I've never had them and not loved them.  Service is typically decent. I've never run into a down-right rude server, but some have been kind of stand-offish.   The place can turn into quite a family magnet during certain times of the day or on weekends. I usually go during off-hours when it's not as busy and I won't be bothered by large crowds.
3 **Summary**        - Flavor - The pizza was average. Nothing gourmet.        - Price - It just seemed from the menu that they were trying to squeeze every last penny out of you. For a pizza they had the following options: $1 more for whole what crust, $2 for artisan thin crust, $3 for gluten free and $2 for vegan cheese. It just seemed excessive. **Ordered**        - $12.50 New York Style Pizza - The pizza was decent but it just seemed over priced. It tasted just like domino's with the same toppings only greasier (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MW6hyPt6Xz6cIVyp_r1yLg?select=Pip7KP3jfZao0cKK_eK0EA). **Recommendations**        - I wouldn't really recommend this place. It's ok food at above average prices.
5 This restaurant and this location in particular is my favorite place to eat in the Las Vegas Area (that is since the closure of Quarks). The tapas are incredible. Being a registered Duck-a-holic, I am a huge fan of the duck tacos. I also enjoy the creative pizzas. The happy hour special can't be matched, half priced tapas, beer and wine from 4 to 6.   Sammy's helped me out with a fundraiser dinner last year as well. They have an excellent community outreach program. They gave me fliers and a percentage of every meal served if they had a flier. It was raining and the staff together decided to allow all of the meals ordered into the percentage for my fundraiser. The Crohn's and Colitis Foundation was the recipient of their generosity.
2 I ordered a Hawaiian pizza here and was unimpressed.  I got thin crust ($2 extra, BTW) and it was so soggy, it was almost like a tortilla.  All the ingredients slid off and it was a mess to eat.  I ordered the same thing at CPK a couple days ago and it was much better, so I know it can be done well.  Kind of pricey, so I won't be back.
4 Sammy's Woodfired Pizza is a good place to go for pizza (duh) and tapas.  It is located in a very safe neighborhood.  Parking is easy.  Service is a hit or miss.
1 The night that I came here was relatively slow. Nice music and ambiance. The servers, I will say, were there the second we were done with a course to remove our plates and to refill our drinks. My one star is primarily based on their food.   For appetizers, we order the Parmesan Crusted Artichokes.  First off, the presentation was tacky. Shredded cabbage? Lame. The artichokes weren't crusted in parmesan, they were buried underneath it.  Once I took a bite, my mouth dried instantaneously. There was waaayyy too much parmesan. The "creamy herb dressing" was just ranch.   For the entree, I ordered a Sun-Dried Tomato pizza.  The crust was flavorless. It tasted more like hard tack than anything.  I don't know if sauce doesn't come on their pizzas or if they just don't put enough on it, but the lack of sauce was depressing. Sauce really binds a pizza together and gives it that extra kick. In fact, the sauce can make or break a pizza. No sauce = No bueno. The only flavor on the pizza was the sun-dried tomatoes, and there weren't enough of them. The pine nuts didn't enhance the pizza in any way. It just tasted like it was thrown on there just for the hell of it. The basil that was supposed to be on the pizza was so shriveled that I didn't even recognize it on the pie. Despite its small size, the pizza had an abundance of grease. The grease made the pizza taste extra bland and oily, which only added to the level of distaste I had for my meal.   I couldn't even go for dessert because I knew I would be thoroughly disappointed. I ended up going to Cold Stone where I knew I would be happy.
5 came with a group of 6  people and were pleasantly impressed by the food, decor and knowledge of our server. My appetizer was great. The asparagus was SO good. I tried my friend's chili and it was absolutely AMAZING!  I will definitely be back!
5 In the past 3 or so months this place has gotten a lot better. The staff is always friendly the food taste great. You can always find a manager now and the service is one of the top notch they have really stepped up their game. Keep it up they have a great happy hour 7 days a week as well.
2 Service was super slow, and it was not a busy night.  Pizza was not exciting.
3 I've been to Sammy's a few times. It isn't my go-to place but when I'm in the area and we are all craving something different it will do. The menu is very eclectic. On my last visit I ordered the sliders and fish tacos and split both with my daughter. The sliders won hands down. I would not order the tacos again. The wine list needs to be updated but the service is always good.
3 I was really hoping to order one of my favorite salads but since we were at a different location, different menu items. Not everything was different, but it forced me to try something new, which wasn't bad.   I ordered a Thai Chicken Salad (I think) which was really good and my boyfriend order a hawaiian pizza with sausage and jalape√±os. We both enjoyed our food very much.  The strange thing was the service. It was kind of on the bad side. There were probably 4 groups outside (including us) and 2 inside, so it wasn't very busy. And we waited a long time to get our waters, get our food, refills, and our bill at the end, we became impatient and got up and handed our waiter the bill as we were leaving. Eh. They were nice, but slow.  Luckily the food tasted good.
3 This location is definitely not the best. I'm on E Sunset Rd a lot and you can totally miss it. I like the southwest location on Arroyo Crossing or Sahara much better.  As for the food and service, I'll honestly say I've always enjoyed what I ordered. They even have a decent kids' menu for my son. A good variety of salads, pizza, and pastas. I love their pizza dough and appreciate that it's not greasy.  I'm very happy if I'm there for happy hour, since their tapas are half off and very creative. However, during regular hours, I think paying full price is a bit steep for appetizers, averaging around $10. Even their serving for only edamame is $6. I've paid much much more for appetizers, but for a pizza place, I don't think it's worth the regular prices. I'd definitely recommend going during happy hour!  I'll definitely come back to Sammy's, even if it's going to the other locations..
1 My girlfriend and I are both big Sammy's fans. We live on the northwest end of town so our usual location is Elkhorn and Durango. We found ourselves in Henderson running some errands and craving Sammy's.  The location is a little difficult to find. Upon entering the restaurant most of the people were outside, however we wanted to sit inside. We were promptly taken to a booth per our request. We waited at least 10 - 15 minutes before our waitress came over and took our drink order. They took so long we were ready to order food as well.  Once we ordered drinks and our food the drinks came quickly. The food followed a few minutes after. Our drinks went empty for prolonged periods of time. I found myself continuously looking around the restaurant for a waiter/waitress. There were approximately 4 waiters/waitresses. The restaurant was mostly empty. The manager was outside sitting with friends. She was completely oblivious to what was going on in her restaurant. There was another table with a gentlemen waving the check he was waiting so long.   Out of the entire wait staff there seemed to be one girl trying really hard to cover the tables, everyone else wasn't concerned about the guests at all. This was a very disappointing experience and I will definitely not be going back to this location.
3 The regional manager for Sammy's Woodfire Pizza contacted me based upon the unpleasant experience I had. I can proudly say she went out of her way to correct the problems that occurred and make it up to me. I was really impressed at the dedication to improving the customer experience. It is rare to see that these days, thank you!!
3 Met up with a high school friend who now resides in Nevada.  We had just finished a tour of Hoover Dam (because we're nerds) and decided on grabbing dinner in Henderson somewhere.  So we were left with Sammy's Woodfired Pizza.  I don't know how this came to be the only choice.  But seeing as to how I've never had it before, I was a go.  Had the LaDou's BBQ Chicken pizza.  Not bad at all.  In fact, I finished the whole pizza minus one and minus the crust.  I think I may need to give this place a second try in California.
3 What I enjoyed the most:  Barbeque chicken pizza on wheat dough - they're perfect together  Other dishes were delicious too but not my favorite: New York Style pizza - needed more mushrooms to balance out the salami, pepperoni, and Italian sausage Grilled shrimp salad - very good salad that accompanied our pizza, will definitely order it again!  What dish they can improve on: Duck tacos - go easy on the sour cream!  Service: We came in a few minutes after happy hour had ended but our waiter was gracious enough to give us our first round happy hour prices!    Why they didn't get four stars: No beers on tap!
5 After several bad experiences at another Sammy's location, we have finally found one that makes up for past issues! This location has a wonderful staff that seem to work well together and don't mind helping each other out. We have had several delicious meals here (with a 2 year old) and have always been very pleased. It's nice to see good customer service is still out there. Keep up the good work!
4 One star up!  After my most recent visit to Sammy's, I believe they are deserving of a better rating.   As far as the food, we ordered the Kobe Beef chili, the kids' pepperoni pizza, LaDou's BBQ Chicken Pizza, & the Brie & Truffle Oil pizza on gluten-free crust. My boyfriend said the chili was tasty, but thought there wasn't much beef. All three pizzas were great. The Brie & Truffle Oil pizza is a new addition to their menu, and it was DELICIOUS! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it...  I still don't care for the location, I wish they had more visual marketing to show they're back there with all the offices. I still think that the tapas are pretty pricey (unless you get there for half-off happy hour). Regardless, we loved the new revamped menu (labeling all vegetarian, vegan, & gluten-free items), and service was awesome!   Thank you for replying to my previous review. We'll be back. Hopefully during happy hour!
4 Had my two grand kids with me and wanted to grab something we all could enjoy. Ordered the sun dried tomato artisan pizza and I had the BBQ chicken pizza, we were hungry so I also ordered fried. everything was delicious.  the amount of sauce was just right, unlike other places that put so much sauce it overpowers the pizza. The sun dried tomato pizza was very flavorful with the goat cheese. this is good considering I am not a big goat cheese fan. the flavors seemed to be perfectly balanced. the grand kids loved the pepperoni. Even the fries were better than most. cooked in fresh oil and seasoned well, we really loved them.
4 Close to work so how can I pass this place up. I frequent this place and really like heir food. Went today with a colleague. We split he duck tacos and I had a Caesars salad with grilled shrimp. As always food and service were both stellar! I still have not ordered pizza, just doesn't jump out to me when looking at the menu. Someday...Maybe!
5 Great gluten-free pizza! Fast service and friendly servers, Greek salad a must!  Lots of seating indoors and out.
5 Oh me oh my! Delicious. Went to this restaurant and this location for the first time about two weeks ago and I am beyond pleased. They have Gluten-Free and Vegan options. Oh AND they use natural and organic products when possible. Absolutely amazing. I have had their Gluten Free Vegan Pasta and their pizza and oh my goodness, mouth watering good. The manager Dina is such a delight. There was a teeny issue with my order ( nothing to get upset about) and she immediately fixed it without asking me. I was beyond surprised and pleased. Been there twice since and both waiters were fabulous. The most important thing for me is the service then the food because I can not enjoy my food with eeky service. The service A+ and the food A+. The patio area is such a nice place to sit at night when the weather is nice. They also offer Herbal Teas that my taste buds truly appreciate. Yum, Go visit. Great place!
2 I've been here several times and the pizza is always very good.  But...since the new Galaxy Luxury plus theater has opened and they've started to get really busy the service has fallen off a cliff.  On our last trip it took about one hour for our pizza to arrive and our drinks never got refilled even once...very upsetting to say the least.  Maybe they're in the process of staffing up, because if not, they're going to need to staff down...all the way down, if you know what I mean ;-).
1 We were excited to have a salad and pizza for dinner and we were  quite disappointed in  the food quality  and service .   Sammy's does not offer Sweet & Low or Equal  as sweeteners , just Splenda and Stevia, both of which I cannot tolerate . So I had to send my iced tea back :(   The Cesar salad took 30 mins to arrive  and it was THE WORST Cesar we ever had ...Drowned in an awful dressing ( way too much of something) , limp lettuce , croutons that could break your teeth , and served on a non chilled plate ...We barely ate a few bites.  Our pizza was served literally 2 minutes after our salad so we had to send it back . We waited 15 mins before someone had the thought to bring it back to our table  . Oh, we added peppers to our NY pizza   and were charged a $1 for 6 juliiene strips , SERIOUSLY!!! And the pizza was COLD when it was returned to us .  Do not even get me started on the lousy waiter !!!  I used to like Sammy's Woodfired Pizza but it would take a miracle to get us to return anytime soon
5 My boyfriend and I visited this restaurant for the first time tonight, with my parents and my six year old daughter. Our server, Brandon, was one of the best servers we've ever had, anywhere! The service was so good that even if the food had been lackluster (which it definitely was not) we'd chalk it up to a bad night and give it another shot.  We had an Asian chicken salad and a New York pizza. The salad was absolutely delicious, with a slightly spicy dressing that was very flavorful. The pizza, which we ordered on wheat crust, had mushrooms, sausage and pepperoni, and the sauce was terrific!  My parents shared a Hawaiian pizza that wasn't terrific, but as I'm not a huge fan of Hawaiian pizza, I may not be the best judge. They also got a pepperoni pizza to go, and I peeked into the box... and almost tried to sneak out with it! It looked and smelled FANTASTIC.  We will definitely be back to Sammy's. My only complaint is that we didn't discover them sooner.
1 Menu not filled with foods that sounded good to me.   Service sucked   Chopped chicken salad boring all lettuce  Mini burgers not even worth 11.50  I will never return to Sammy's!!!
1 Never. Again.  About twenty of us were here for dinner last night.  It took a while for all of us to arrive, and when they took our orders, I was one of the last people at the end of the table to order. I asked for a barbecue chicken pizza, no special crust or anything.  A while later, they started to bring our orders out. It probably took close to 10 minutes with all the people, starting with the opposite end of the table. After they got down to my end of the table and got everybody else their orders, I was still waiting for mine. A few minutes later, I asked the server what happened to my order. She went to the kitchen to check, and apparently they didn't start it. OK, I guess. Everybody else is already eating, but I can wait a while longer because they may have missed my order.  My friend had ordered the same pizza, but with a gluten free crust. She offered to trade me a piece now for one of mine later, and I gratefully accepted. At least five minutes later, the server brought out a pizza. But I realized that it was gluten free, not the standard crust. This second mistake was absolutely not acceptable.  Yes, they did finally get my order correct on the 3rd try. But at this point, everybody else had either finished or almost finished eating, and I upset and embarrassed that I had yet to start. The pizza didn't taste as good to me as it might have tasted normally, although I found the slice from my friend to be just average anyway. On top of this, all I got was an apology from the server, not an apology from the manager and definitely not some sort of coupon or discount to make it up to me. That would have saved them at least another star on this review.  Moral of the story: Do not take your large group here. Maybe one companion or a small group is fine, but look somewhere else if you want to make a large group happy.  It's a real shame. I wanted to try their duck tacos during happy hour some time, but it's not going to happen now.
4 We had the same experience as Jennifer D.  We enjoyed our meal of Hawaiian Pizza, salad with the nonfat cheese making it somewhat healthy.  But I am not writting about the food as the server, Brandon, he was excellent.  He cleaned the tables, swept the floors, worked as a hostess, knew the menu well and made several helful recommendations.  He created substanial added value for the restaurant. Lucky GM Dina.

3 Pretty darn good pizza and great appetizers.  The staff was friendly and the place was clean.  I enjoyed the atmopshere.
1 Its not the food that made me not want to eat here ever again, its the service. Twice Ive been here and they f@*k up my order every time.  The first time I went, I asked for the glutton free crust pizza. We basically ate the whole pizza and found out later we got the regular crust. The place was pretty much empty on a week day for lunch, so why was service so slow? We had to ask several times for water and basically didnt get any. When I asked for a box, he took my plate of leftovers and never returned. A new server came out and I asked her where is my leftovers? She said "Im sorry they threw it away" Because I like the food so much and the alternatives that they offer I decided to give it another try.  We went again for lunch and asked for the pizza with Vegan cheese. A long dark haired woman with fluffy eyelashes was polite and cheery. But her pleasant attitude didnt mean much when, again the cheese was wrong and we ate a whole pizza with the wrong cheese. I was dissatisfied with the salad drenched in dressing that it was just overly saturated and soupy from the dressing.  After explaining to her that I was experiencing a stomach ache and was upset she gave us the wrong cheese, she didnt call for a manager. Instead she hands me a coupon for a free appetizer with a purchase of an entree.   Why do you even offer alternatives for people who have food allergies when your servers dont even pay attention to things that are serious like that? Take it off the menu if your servers dont seem to give a rats ass.
5 Wonderful pizza!  Great gluten free crust.  Will come back for sure!! Megan our sever was awesome as well!
3 The duck taco's are amazing, THE best thing there. It's a little pricey and it's decorated like my aunts house from 1992, but otherwise a really nice experience.
4 My vegen buddy claims this place is good for his "veganess".  Tasty!.  Dinner here tonight was very good.  Megan provided excellent service and was a pleasure to deal with.  Thai pizza, no longer on the menu, was still available and was delicious.  The Mediterranean appetizer was excellent, the asparagus with balsamic and almonds was outstanding, and the portions were generous.  Great food, the only beef is that they were out of several beers due to being in the process of moving.  Sometimes the garlic at Sammy's can be overwhelming, but tonight it was just fine!  Excellent dining for the whole family, reasonably priced (a bit higher than a typical family joint, tho) and a cool place to kick it with friends.
5 We love the Balsamic Grilled Chicken Salad, wonderful flavors and always delicious, big enough for two. We always get the Cheesy Bread with it which is actually like a white cheese pizza, fabulous!  And if you go between 4 and 6 pm the appetizers are 1/2 price. We've been coming here for years and have always had good food and service. They have a sign on their front door that they will be moving to Green Valley Pkwy and Pebble Sept 26th. I would follow them anywhere!!!
2 Pulled up to this location yesterday, and besides what YELP, and even the signs in the shopping center say, this location is no longer open, and has moved to Pebble/Green Valley. They will be open in late September.
5 We went here for the first time tonight and it was an awesome choice! My husband and I both got pizza. It seemed like they had a little bit of everything on the menu. the pizza was amazing! Really unique flavor combinations, which I love! Not your mama's pizza! My husband said it was the best bbq chicken pizza he's had and he tries that almost anywhere we go! We were impressed and will definitely be back again and again...and again!
1 We are never going back! We ordered the crab cake. It was cold in the center. We also ordered the rachlette, bacon, potato pizza. There was no rachlette on the pizza. Potato was the dominate flavor on the pizza. The service was poor as well. We asked for a Bellini and we got champagne with peach schnapps inside.
4 Maybe its because I went here to eat a pizza and not save the rainforest or the cow that I enjoyed it!  (You have to wonder about some reviewers)  Been here several times and always enjoyed the cozy atmosphere and friendly servers.  Just need to make sure you never get a booth or a table near the restrooms.  If they try to seat you to the right as you walk in, refuse... The bathrooms are there and the chemical smell filters back in that area.    Against the windows is excellent to see the kitchen the people and outside.    I had the new York Pizza and my GF had a salad.  The pizza was crisp and spicy, yet flavorful.  Not the chemical spicy, but spice from the ingredients used.  I like that.     The salad was large, fresh and filled with what was promised..  Something you don't always see elsewhere.    We both enjoyed the meal.  They were busy but did not rush you out the door once you got down to the last bites.  I liked that.  Able to sit and relax after the meal and enjoy the company.
3 I had the Margarita pizza, chopped chicken salad, and the crab & shrimp appetizer. I wish the appetizer would have come before our meal. The service was fine. The manager came to see how everything was, we told him great, except for the Trance Music which was playing too  loud in the background. That was irritating, not relaxing.
2 Ok, since they have moved to the new GV location, the service has been APPAULING. Personally, I've seen Sammy himself at the new store everytime I eat there and he needs to get on the ball with the servers (the new ones, not the old servers from the Sunset location).  I absolutely loved the servers from the old location, especially Megan!  Everytime I come in, she knows my order by memory and is an efficient server.  Now, I cannot believe the lack of professionalism from the new staff. Everytime I come during happy hour, once I receive the check,  the server forgets to take the discount off of the half off tapas... Every time. The are terrible with refills and more over, I have more personality in my left shoe than 80% of these girls. Please Sammy, get your shit together because Ive been coming here every week for years now I don't want to come back!
1 Ok. Round 2 and the last round for me at this joke of an establishment. So from the get go, the wish-washy manager/host's confusion as to who to seat was an atrocity.   Next, it took 10 minutes after we sat down to even see our waiter. Now, I don't know about how the stations are ran/numbered, but 2 different times a runner or a manager would deliver food to which wasn't even ordered at our table.  The one time the runner just left the plate at the end of the table, left and asked the waiter who the food belonged too.  First of all, do the tables not have numbers on the receipts? The lack of professionalism AGAIN was disturbing. Now finally, we come to the check, where the half off happy hour tapas were YET AGAIN not marked down.  The service here has finally taken it's toll over the delicious food.  I'd rather make my own pb and j than endure the simpleton staff!
5 They accidentally put cow cheese on my pizza (which I am allergic to), but then they felt so bad they comped out whole meal for a party of 9. Super hospitable and accommodating! Thank you Sammie's crew.
