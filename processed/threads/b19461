5 I have been the patient of this office for the 2 years and obtaining best dental services The front office staff is very professional, friendly and pleasant. They maintain great discipline in appointment time and procedural duration. The dentist is awesome. She gives a good detail of the treatment procedures and you will know whats being done to you in great detail. The assistants are very friendly. I highly recommend this place for best dental treatment
5 Dr.Sonji (not sure on spelling) and Sonya made my two kids feel so comfortable. I was impressed because we were quickly seen and I was kept in the loop about what was happening. Very friendly staff and biggest perk is I could walk to the office from my house. Overall great service and minimal wait time.
1 Worst dentist I have been to! I came in for a check up and first they scheduled me at 3:45 pm when they close at 4pm. When he walked in he didn't say hi or any other greeting just asked for my name and read my X-rays. He then proceeded to tell me that I had a lot of cavities (I haven't been to a dentist in a while) and then he told me that I must like my candies and my soda! Yes I am a little over weight but that does not give anyone the right to look down or talk down to me. I walked out in tears and nobody in the office said a word to me after they took my copay. I will never go back to this dentist nor recommend this dentistry to ANYONE that I know!!
