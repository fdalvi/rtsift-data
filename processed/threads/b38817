5 We went here today for our first studio family portrait. Priscilla, the photographer, was great and she made sure the kids looked great in the pictures. The kids had fun with her. Bridgett, the salesperson, was really nice and helpful as well. She explained things clearly for us when we were picking out our pictures and package. Overall it was a pleasant experience today!
4 Not to expensive awesome deals and great pictures.  Bridgette rocks.  She did our engagement pictures and they came out so good.  She convinced us to bring out 7 month old. We came back a week later and she was so patient with him. Especially since these were his first professional pictures since he was first born.  We received a great deal and we got our pictures archive for 2 years with the Target portrait card and free sitting fees. We will be back next month for family pictures. Check out Groupon before you purchase pictures.
