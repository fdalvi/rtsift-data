5 Dr. Wareing is absolutely the best doctor I have ever encountered in my life! She is so nice and you can definitely tell that she loves her job. She is so good at explaining all things in plain english instead of "doctor talk" and has never, ever made me feel like she was rushing through an appointment. I know her office is always very busy with patients, so it is nice that she still takes the time to make you feel important. I have since moved quite a ways away from her office, but continue to drive across town whenever I need an appointment. Thank you Dr. Wareing!
5 LOVE Dr. Sally.  She is always so great with me and the questions I ask. She explains things in plain English and does not talk over your head.    I never feel rushed and I always feel like her priority.
5 I really love Dr. Wareing. We just found out that my husband is getting a job transfer to Tucson and I am SO sad that I have to switch OBs. I had the same experience as the other reviewers. Dr. Wareing is super kind and attentive. She tended to ask a couple of times during the appointment, "Do you have any other questions?" She wanted to make sure I wasn't sitting at home worrying about anything. Great doctor, very good communication skills. The office staff has always been very kind in my experience as well.
5 Dr. Wareing has taken care of me with both of my babies, my second one just so happen to have a little bit of extra love (T21) & I seriously can't believe how supportive she was of everything I was going through which seriously is what I needed. The absolute best! I recommend her for all new moms :-)
