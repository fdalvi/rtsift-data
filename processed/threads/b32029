4 Wonderful way to get around Maddy and for 10.00, you can ride as much as you like, just have to check in the bike now and then during the 24 hour period. We didn't drive the rental car once during our stay.
5 Visited from out of town for a conference, staying near the Capitol, but had events down near Union South and Memorial Union.  And wanted to explore campus and town a bit and run some more errands, so I needed to carry some supplies for the conference, as well as beer and cheese curds.  Rented bikes for 2 days and rode at least a dozen times.  Bikes were great!  Small inconvenience when one location (Charter) had zero open docking stations, but Union South nearby was sufficient.
