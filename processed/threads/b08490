1 I didn't even want to give them one star.  They ripped me off, charged me two times on my credit card and have yet to refund my money.  The technician forgot to turn on both units to activate the heat and then said the system was faulty.  In actuality it was just the inexperience of the technician.  Its difficult to get through and they rarely answer their phone.  This place is a scam and a ripoff.  Give me back my money now!  Stay away.
5 I have used them 4 times in 14 years, tempe, mesa, and phoenix, phx, az, they provide service through out the valley az, arizona  ALWAYS GREAT service. Always been same day , fair and reasonable pricing.  They have never tried to sell me anything I have not needed.  It is really important to find a good honest repair company and that would definitely be these people. I have always requested Ken, he is very nice, personable guy. Obviously I only see him every few years and it is fun to "catch up" with each other. I really feel as though I have a "friend in the business".
5 Always do a nice job and are reliable.
