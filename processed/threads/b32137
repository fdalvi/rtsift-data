5 Visited 11/09-11/10 weekend. Booked our rooms through our timeshare, but they booked the wrong day. So when we got to the hotel we didn't have reservations. The women at the front desk (Marie) was more then helpful and super friendly, very good customer service! She made our trip.   The rooms where good & I would definitely  return.
3 We went during spring break everything else was at least $69 more than this hotel in the area we were totally happy. Clean rooms, freshly painted building, pool and hot tub we're clean, great for the money. The two things that may be a deal breaker for some are that the building is old and noisy. Our neighbors across the hall poked their heads out the door when we came in late and we were not being loud. The showers are weak as well. would go again
