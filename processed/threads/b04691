5 Awesome pizza & wings! Great specials and great prices.
3 They have great pizza and wings. My only complaint with this restaurant is you can order wings medium one time and their great, the next time there really weak, and than you get the medium that's too hot to eat. They need consistency in their wing sauce!
1 If customer service issues are important to you, you will leave this establishment alone.  I called to file complaint to manager at the Surprise location only to be called a FUCKING BITCH.  Wow, I still cant believe this happened.  He not only called me this once but 2 times before hanging up on me.  apparently he didn't like me complaining.   Their staff has always been very unprofessional at this location, but never did I think that the manager here would behave like this.  My advise to you is give you business to some one who appreciates it.
