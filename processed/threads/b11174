5 This little hole in the wall offers the BEST fluff and fold service and same day! The two men that run the place are super sweet and very attentive to detail. Affordable and quick service. The plaza they're in may be questionable but your laundry will be amazing.
4 Owner present at location and very helpful - retro galore :) including old pacman machine and of course rock solid machinery !
5 Used the fluff and fold service once on a long cross country trip with the kids.  Owner remembered my name when I returned for laundry. Same day service, exactly what I was looking for at non-strip price.
5 Place was clean, every machine working and friendly staff. We were able to do some quick laundry in a pinch. Very reasonable and quick access.   Last load is 8pm.
