4 This is a character shop in a great location. If you are coming along the Apache trail then this whole area is worth a stop for a gander.  This store in particular I remember well because (1) it wasn't that long ago when we were there and (2) as the other reviewer mentions, prickly pear fudge. It's sickly sweet and supposedly the only place to get prickly pear fudge. This of course meant I had to get some to try. We had 1 block and it's super sweet. Super yummy as well.  The lady helping us out was very patient and friendly. It was a very nice start to our trip.
