4 Nice people friendly atmosphere. They did a very nice job on my nails and the spa pedicure with callus remover and sugar scrub had a beautiful result. They have many styles of hand painted artwork and jewels for nails. Reasonably priced.
5 This place does awesome work and the prices are awesome too. The ladies here are all very nice and make you feel comfortable. I recommend this place!
5 Amazing staff!! I have been going here for 2 years now and won't go anywhere else. Friendly, great price and great work they do. They are always willing to make my nails as requested through photos etc..
5 Very friendly, relaxed salon. Great value and artwork from these ladies. They're always willing to please the client. The prices cant be beat in the area and theres hardly ever a wait. I get my pedis on a regular basis here and have been pleased with the eyebrow waxes too.
1 Worse $15 I have ever spent.   A joke of a pedicure. Little to no massage and the buffing of my feet was terrible.  They might be worse now.  Save your $15 for the delicious sushi next store.
2 Pedicure was ok .. Don't waste the money on the leg message could even tell she was touching me.. Pretty weak effort on her part reflected in her Tip!
