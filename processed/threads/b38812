4 Not what I expected, Better. A wide selection of toys LeLo and the like with tons of lingerie and shoes! Body glitter and bindi; fun fun fun. Reasonable prices. The outside is plain and does not do justice to what they offer inside.  Think 50 Shades meets Victoria's Secret. Yes they have movies and magazines but their selection of books (instructional) and body lotions, potions, creams and lube is larger than their movie collection.  What I was not expecting was their selection of gag gifts! Too much fun!!  Deff worth a shopping trip. They do parties and I just might have to invite the girls out for a great night.
5 Clean store, friendly and knowledgable staff, and great selections. Variety of plus size lingerie. Out of the way but would definitely return!
2 Ya, OK, it is a adult toy store right.. Sometimes I want to go look at things I might buy on Amazon.. Seriously. This store is a bit over priced, they all are in my opinion, anywho.. I just want to snoop around in stores like this, I have no interest in chatting it up with the sales staff. SERIOUSLY, if I need your help I will ask.   So I walk in and the sales staff says hi, I say hi and move on in.. now she is following me.."Is there anything I can help you find?" Nope, I'm good... She is still on me, "Well we have x and y and this and that" Uh, ya thanks I'm good.. SERIOUSLY? I have a rough idea of whats in here, leave me alone sheeesh!  The sales staff is inappropriate and nosy, unless you like to feel like you have stepped onto a used car lot from the 1980's... come on people a bit of decorum! UUGGHHH.. Will not be back..  However, if you have zero idea of what to do with the things you find in here, I am pretty sure the sales staff could give you detailed instructions ANNOYING..
5 Friendly and Knowledgeable staff. This place has high quality products and fair pricing for this type of retail store. I highly recommend them.
4 High quality, comfortable place to shop. I recommend it.
