5 Had to drop off our rental at this location and it was nice and easy!  Great customer service, in and out in 5 minutes, no extra charges that we weren't aware of and that was it!  Easy to find and they are inside the Triple A repair center. If you are coming from the 101, turn left on Thunderbird and go behind the Walgreens is probably the easiest way to get in. Kinda tricky.
1 Rent a car here HERTz few time but this time I rent for a week Sat to Sat $271/week and decide to keep the car Extra Mon n Tues and return on Wed morning and they charge me 4 extra days which is another $183. How do you count that is 4 days when I only use it Mon n Tues .????? Sun CLODED. If I know they count like that I rather keep it till Mon n it only double the rent which it $542. Total. Now I have to pay $454 for only till Wed MORNING.  I rent a car alots for business trip and other occasion but other company never like that. This rental place is rip off so make sure if u decide to keep another 2 day mine as well keep for another week. Becareful when you decide to keep extra day ppl.
5 Ryan took care of us, staying in town nearby for the week, he got us another car without a nail in the tire, and set us up with an SUV upgrade for the 9 hour trip home
