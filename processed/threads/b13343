1 They lie to you! They tell you that you can bundle Direct TV with CenturyLink, get you to sign a 2 year contract. They get the Direct TV hooked up immediately, but nothing from CenturyLink. After getting jerked around for a couple of weeks they finally tell you that CenturyLink is not available in your area! They knew this all along and even try to blame CenturyLInk for not telling you! The owner won't return phone calls and pushes everything off to his uniformed secretary. HORRIBLE! The Direct TV works great, but get it anywhere else. I HATE being lied to!!!
1 this the worst company to work for mike is the owner and Krystal Jacobs is management, they don't pay there techs and lie to there customers
1 They are lucky to even get one star. Promised to come between 8-12. No one showed. When I called to see what happened, they had no record of it. Horrible customer service! Previously had Cox for years with no issues. Going to cancel direct tv and go back to cox.
