1 Very nice new Hospital and the staff is actualy pretty nice, but .......  Even though there was not very much going on because I checked in my wife and she was quickly seen, but the staff seemed very unorganized, we got a visit from the Dr and he asked what was wrong and he checked her, told her what was wrong and what meds he would give her and he was on his way, but then another Medic came in, asked the same questions "What's wrong?, what brings you here?" and then he went on his way. Then another medic came in and same questions, then a nurse came in and same questions, and then another .... I kid not we had to explain to at least 8 people what was wrong, 3 nurses entered some info into the system and each time one of them came in they woud keep asking and asking, it's like there is no communication between them and it's like none of them had anything else to do so they would see "Oh someone is in that room over there I better go and look and act like I am busy doing something".  Again, it looked ike not many people were being tended to and they still held us for over 2 hours, I understand they had to keep my wife for some time just to make sure she wasn't coming back again but the Dr that visited us first told us it wasn't anything serious and he would give her some meds for it, but yet it took 2+ hours for it.  I am never, ever, ever, coming back, now I understand why it was so "empty" when we came in, I guess other people knew about what we went through.
4 I had a great experience at Florence Hospital.   Pros:  1. Quick door to doctor (I didn't even sit down and I was already talking to a doctor). 2. Very helpful staff 3. Portable X-Ray machine is very convenient  4. Doctors are knowledgeable and presented the correct diagnosis  Cons: 1. They are out of network, and considered a private hospital. (Not an issue in the event of an emergency, but something to take into consideration)
