2 It's one of the Sprint Stores that has technicians on site when your phone is having a problem.  That's nice.  Too bad every time you see a technician at a Sprint Store, they seem to always have the same solution.  Reboot the phone.  It's like a bad IT department.  I lost my phone for 90 minutes to do something I could've done on my own.  The technician was kind enough to backup my contacts on the memory card, but didn't take the time to put them back on the phone.  It actually appears the problem was my charger, not the phone, so was the reboot even necessary?  Also, If you don't have Sprint's insurance, you may have to pay for any repairs even if the phone is under warranty.  You have to deal with the manufacturer if it's under warranty.  Thanks for standing by your products, Sprint.
4 Not really sure why everyone are all giving bad reviews about this store.  I enjoyed going to shop at this store as the employees won't rush me into making a decision right away on any products.  They actually listen to what I need and offer any help I asked for.  I would definitely go back to this location whenever I need help with my Sprint phone.
2 It seems like whenever I go in to this store what should only take 5 minutes to do ends up taking 20. It doesn't help that this company has the worst customer service year after year.
