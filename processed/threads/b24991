4 "6 inch tuna on white bread, with everything including spinach, but NO pickles".  Not even joking, this THE only subway that ever gets my sandwich right. Thank you for the $5 meal deal, it beats the other chains in this shopping plaza as far as price for lunch.
3 They make your sandwich the way you ask for it.  Plus, they're fast and gave me a free cookie card for being in the health profession.  Three stars because I consider Subway to be an average chain and not gourmet food.
