4 As convenience markets go, this store is one of the better ones.  Generally the employees here have a better attitude and actually show some concern for what they are doing. You see the same employees here, not much of a turnover. The store is clean,  well organized, and rarely is out of anything. You are not likely to be accosted by someone asking for money on the lot.  The only thing your really need to be concerned about is that the outside could have been arranged better.  It is busy so you do have to watch for people coming in and around the gas pumps.  They could have used more room there but you can't have everything.
5 A frequent stop for me. Great service, Great Employees. One of my favorite stores in the valley.
2 I have to say they have the friendliest staff but one of the dirtiest soda fountain areas EVER!  The store is easy to navigate and it's never a slow process when you want to get in and out of there.  I just suggest they invest in a few cleaning supplies.
