4 MISSION: TO FIND THE TASTIEST TACOS ON LAS VEGAS' STREETS  WHO:STREET VENDORS AROUND LAS VEGAS(Brick and mortars like Los Tacos and El Gordo DO NOT COUNT!) Open for Just two weeks now, Tacos Estephanie has a bunch of fans. Why?....They're some of the cheapest tacos on the streets($.99-$1.25) and best of all, HANDMADE TORTILLAS ON THE SPOT! You can definitely taste the difference.  We stopped by after revisiting Tacos Cancun(and on our way to Tacos La Carreta) during our street taco scramble, and when you see "Tortillas hechas a mano" it automatically deserves a visit. Three nice ladies are holding it down, pumping out order after order serving up everyone and definitely convincing alot of people to get 2-3 rounds of their tasty tacos. I tried 2 each of their Al Pastor and Tripas, along with a Mushroom and Cheese Quesadilla ($2)  Although there was no Al Pastor carousel, the tacos were pretty flavorful as was the quesadilla. After handing the lady a"You've been Yelped!" card (as I did with all the other vendors) we were on our way and definitely happy we discovered another tasty spot...  PROS:  Fresh Tortillas  Great Value  Great Service   CONS:  Tacos can be a little greasy for some   Stop by and give Tacos Estephanie a try!

5 I stopped here yesterday afternoon and glad I did!   Since I moved to Vegas my love for tacos has reached a whole new level. So naturally I like doing a little research and trying new places. This place is just west of Maryland Parkway on the north end of Charleston.   Everything on the menu is priced cheap. All tacos are $0.99, except the Lengua and Tripa ($1.25). I started my meal with 2 tacos and a burrito, both Pastor. For a total of $6.00 this was a steal. The tacos are a little small but for $0.99 how can one complain about size when it tastes so dang good? When served the pastor was on top of a perfectly made tortilla. As for toppings, they have a full salsa bar with many options. I made my tacos with some pico and pineapple salsa, bomb. Next came the burrito. Inside it contained pastor, rice, beans, cilantro, cheese all wrapped in a warm tortilla.   I'm not gonna lie, I was pretty hungry and ate these with ease and had room. So.. I got 2 more tacos for Round 2.   This time around I tired the Asada with cilantro, onion, and their red salsa. These were also very good! Both meats I tried were moist, tender, and very good. The tortillas speak for themselves.   I'm already making plans to come here again once I'm in the neighborhood.
