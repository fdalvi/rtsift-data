4 Great place lots of options for pedicures all include mini massages and scrubs and everyone is very nice. One girl actually recommend some nail colors I didn't consider before but it turned out great and still within the theme I wanted. Mainly tho I come for the pedis they have citrus, pumpkin, yogurt, and a milk and honey one to name a few they all sound so luxurious! Definitely recommend
5 They did a beautiful job on my nails nice and relaxing place all very nice. Even did a fantastic job on my eye brow wax I love this place will go back for certain!  Made an appointment and got there early they helped me right away :) Nate did amazing on my bubble gum mickey nails :)
4 Best place I've been to in the 3 years I've lived in Las Vegas.
