4 Salad late at night- No greasy slop for bedtime. Light and refreshing.   Okay, so my Haiku skills suck, so next time I'll figure out a creative rap that can take those youtube suckas to the cleaners.   In seriousness, a salad (Pecan Apple Chicken Salad) and a small frosty hits the spot  at 1am.   Sometimes grease shouldn't be king of the night, but something a bit lighter and easy on the stomach so I can go to bed.
4 Those spicy nuggets hit the spot.  I used to live off of side salads and chicken nuggets when money was tight.  This place still has all my favorite side items for a good price.
4 My Grandson loves it says burgers are bigger and better then other fast food places but I find the price you pay for a meal you could go to a restaurant and get full service for the same price or less.
1 I used to work here as a manager about 20 years ago and boy, has it gone down hill! I remember that when they cook hamburgers, they always have to have a few on the grill, even when it's slow so the customer doesn't have to wait. Once they have been on the grill for awhile, they put it in a holding pan and use it for chili. It has almost a rancid grease smell to it in the pan, but once it is boiled down, it tastes fine and is virtually grease-less. Once it hits that pan, it should never be served.  We went about 3:00 in the afternoon and ordered 5 single combos. Three of the five tasted like they took them out of the chili meat pan, the other two tasted ok, although dry. Did they have only two burgers on the grill (and overcooked)? Did they take the other three out of the chili meat holding pan? I guess we will never know for sure. I never complained to the restaurant manager, but did email corporate. I never heard back from them.  Avoid fast food, but...AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST!
