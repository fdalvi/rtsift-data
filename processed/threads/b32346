5 I recently had a slab leak which is about the worst news you can get as far as plumbing problems.  I first had a plumber out who misdiagnosed the problem and proposed cutting up te wall in what ended up being the wrong spot.    I researched online and called Amazing Leak Detection.  Terry was prompt and very courteous.  He found the problem quickly and repaired it efficiently with no surprises or unexpected problems.    The problem was fixed and for a very fair price.  He was very consciensciouss about helping me get the work done well while not costing any more than it had to.  This will be the first place I call for any other plumbing needs.
5 I have an elderly client who had a leak out by her pool. I saw the other good review that Amazing Leak Detection, called for pricing (lower than others I had found) and decided to recommend them to her. They came out right away and detected and fixed her leak and she was VERY pleased.
5 Joe did a great job of isolating my pool pipe leak and fixing it without digging up my entire patio.  I couldn't be more pleased with the entire process.  The work was done quickly, professionally, accurately, and at a very reasonable price.  I hope my pipes never leak again but if they did I would call Amazing Leak Detection in a heartbeat.
2 These guys looked like they had good reviews so I hired them to address an issue with my pool.  The issue was misdiagnosed twice with repairs being done on other items along the way.  In the end we had to hire another company to fix the issue for us who had the correct diagnostic equipment.
5 Ted came out an spent time getting the correct results.  I think he did an excellent job.  I recommend his service .  they have a printable coupon and good pricing.  Very friendly.
