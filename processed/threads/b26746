5 great place to live! i've been here almost 3 years and LOVE the staff and the neighborhood. my building is super quiet, neighbors leave me alone and its very well maintained! Maintenance guys are always so so so helpful too!!
3 I lived at the Verona Apartments for a year and a half. I lived on the first floor and I am guessing due to thin walls and insulation I could always hear my upstairs neighbors! The ground were always kept up nicely and the complex was always very clean.  One draw back is having to make a u-turn or go to the next exit to avoid it since it is located of Boulder Highway.  But overall it was a good experience.
1 We have lived at the Verona for two years and for a little more than a year of that it has been pleasant. We live in a downstairs apartment and the upstairs neighbors are extremely loud. They both work out of the apartment, one during the day and one at night. So for 24 hours a day we have to put up with a child running throughout the apartment, jumping off of furniture, kicking who know what ( and this goes on for 1, 2, and even 3 hours at a time), furniture being drug across the floors, stomping, hammering, banging, etc. we have complained to know avail. We were told to contact Metro, they laughed and said they were the wrong ones to contact. Call security which we have numerous times, still they can't hear a thing. Now we are being told that we may be too picky about quiet and without third party confirmation they won't do anything. Well if you like noises from your neighbors waking you up all night and management that turns a blind eye to it because they are "so nice" move hear. Don't be fooled by the pretty exterior.
