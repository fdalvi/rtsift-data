5 Green Leopard Graphics on a scale of 1-10 is beyond a 10.  I don't even know where to start with this company.  1. They are very professional, reliable, and very well priced for the outstanding quality of work you receive.   I have gone through a lot of different printing services who lag on time, say they will have a proof to you my a certain time, or date, never hear from them, etc.  Green Leopard has helped my business get amazing exposure with designs of business cards, fliers, they are currently working on a design for an A-Frame, and a design for a wrap.  I strongly recommend this company to anyone who wants a quick reliable and honest service.
5 Hether at Green Leopard Graphics designed and printed my business cards.  She was so professional she pointed out to me I had been using business cards that had wrong info on them.   She made us C.A.T.S., inc. a more professional, good looking and useful business card and did it in such a quick, professional manner.   We love them and she will always do our business cards and anything else we might need done.
1 I called today the woman who answered the phone did not use the business name or even her first name. The conversation was confusing. It seemed unprofessional. I just said I thank you and looked for a real company.
