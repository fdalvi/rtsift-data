1 WORST nail salon I've EVER been to (and believe me, I've been to ALL kinds)!  Las Vegas native now in NY, have gotten nails done all over the US and other countries and I have definitely been to GheTTo ones but this one beats them all!  Place is unsanitary.  My nail person had the nerve to straight up put acetone in the nail polish bottle I chose because it was glunky and old. No Top Coat and just wack!  Was about to get up and leave in the middle of service.    DON'T WASTE your time!  I would have rather bought my own bottle and jack up my own nails than spend $12 for a crap job.
2 it was ok, no music or anything fun going on. He re polished my toes which lasted a long time. :-). Manicured my nails ok
1 My husband and I both went here for a manicure and pedicure while in Vegas.  The place is very dirty and they did not clean the manicure table between clients.  This was one of the worst manicures/pedicures I have ever receievd.  The french tips were not even, my nails were not cut (only filed), and there were bubbles in my polish after it dried.  I would recommend going elsewhere.
2 It doesn't look like they get a lot of people in here at all. It was like a ghost town. The old guy did my nails. They looked okay but when you look closer you can see the messy paint job. The place could use a cleaning. The prices are average. Overall, this isnt a place I would go out of my way to get my nails done.
