3 Just a carwash.  Has DIY stations and a drive-thru option.
2 I love the coin operated car wash model. It is usually cheaper than a regular car wash, you get to do it yourself, and there are no brushes. This location leaves much to be desired though. First, their pricing is a little more than other locations and is not as clear (i.e. not posted). Finally, I think the quality of the chemicals is not as good as other locations. My car never looks as good when cleaned here and the difference is very apparent.
4 This is a pretty good place to go if you don't mind putting in a little elbow grease.  I used to use the soap and brush, but for the shoddy finish on my car, I now just use the spray soap and rinse.  I can detail the car in a bay around the corner just after the vacuuming.  The price is fair and if you're fast, you can get a wash for about $1.75 minimum or so.  Vacuuming cost $1, I believe, again only if you're fast.  There's an attendant that walks the grounds during the day, so you can feel reasonably safe here.  The attendant is a nice guy, but don't break his rules.  There's a couple machines that'll exchange your green for tokens.  Your can buy towels in the vacuum lanes.  There's a small office where the attendant hangs out who'll, I assume,  take your money for an automated wash or provide other accessories like air fresheners.  Very old school place, but I like it.  You can't go wrong here, so get off the couch and clean your car.  If your lucky your may get serenaded with some authentic mexican music from the guy vacuuming his car next to you.  Have fun!
