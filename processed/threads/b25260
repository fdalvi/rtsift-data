4 No need for me to be pretentious about my dry cleaning.  These guys were cheap, efficient, and I had a job well done.  My new go to dry cleaner.  Remember though, cash upfront is the only form of payment they take.
1 Omg, I got here at 701pm and begged the 2 kids that were counting their drawers to let me get my dry cleaning. I had 24 shirts over $ 60 worth but no girl just waved her hands and said sorry dude. In my opinion if you are running a dry cleaners, service has to be the 1 thing that differentiates you from the others. Get it together.
1 They lost my pants for two of my suits and refuse to reimburse me or replace what was lost.     The owner repeatedly screened my phone calls to avoid speaking with me about the issue. He would never even let me get a word in during our first phone call and kept insisting that I had misplaced it.    Now I have two, nicely tailored suit coats sitting in my closets without pants.  Don't use this company.
