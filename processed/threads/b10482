1 Simple order of Spicy Chicken Nuggets and a small Chili.  I get a small chili that is so runny that it's like broth and to top that off I was given no crackers. If you don't have enough chili and your giving someone the bottom of the pot then at least give crackers. :(
3 While I don't review a lot of fast food places, I felt the need to talk about this one as it brings forth a point that I make about any and all fast food restaurants.  But first....  I'm not so much a fan of Wendy's burgers.  Flavor wise, they just don't do it for me.  I am, however, a fan of their chicken nuggets.  And I appreciate the variety on their dollar menu.  My recent discovery, the Cheesy Cheddar Burger is decent.  Not great, but certainly decent, and doable when you need a quick bite.  The place also gets points for having a nice staff.  I've had good experiences with the staff through every transaction here, and they are helpful and friendly.  I don't ask for a lot, but they do a fine job.  So what is this "point"?  I don't eat fast food vegetables.  Period.  And I was reminded this when I tried their value menu Chicken Caesar Wrap.  I guess you could point out a "Well, what do you expect for a dollar" comment, but I DON'T expect brown, wilty lettuce.  So I turned my meal into a chicken wrap, minus the caesar.    Heh.  I guess you could say that I came to bury caesar, not to praise him.  Come on.  Groan all you want, but I had a great opportunity to add that.  How could I not?  Well, Wendy's, we'll always have chicken nuggets....
1 Meh. Gross location poor service, rotten drive-thru. Had to repeat our order like seven times. Food was fine I guess.
2 Saw the waffle ice cream cone on the window and rolled in on impulse.  FAIR WARNING:  don't get it.  It's like they poured a milk shake into a cone.  Unhappy camper :/
