5 John and his crew are great! Good service and very convenient!
5 The staff here was so helpful to me with my divorce. I highly recommend them for any of your legal needs.
1 The ladies who work here are super nice. BUT the man who works here is dreadful! Every time I encounter him I leave wishing I had never gone there. Which is why I have decided I will no longer bring my business to this location.  He is rude, condescending, and acts as though he is doing me some huge favor by providing me with his service. I think not- sorry but someone else can have my money.
5 John, Carmel and the entire staff are always great. They did an excellent job on my divorce and John is always helpful when my family regularly uses them for mail services. John is retiring soon and I hate to see him go, but will continue to patronize NV Legal Forms for all of my shipping needs.  Carmel did a thorough and professional job preparing my divorce paperwork and even made suggestions on how to get the paperwork done more efficiently. She was kind to my now ex-wife when we had to go in and sign papers as well.  Highly recommend!
5 Carmel is always so helpful and knowledgeable, and the rest of the staff is just as great!
5 This place is awesome. Every time I go in there we are either next in line or go right up to the counter. I hate going to the post office and they can handle anything I need to do. The ladies who work there are very helpful and friendly. They definitely are a pleasure to talk to.
