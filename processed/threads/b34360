5 On the money! The store was clean and organized.  The location is easy to find.  The employee was friendly and fast.  Will definitely come here for all my shipping needs!
5 Joe is awesome. I have a mailbox here. As I pull up he gathers my mail and boxes and helps me load my car. Always smiling and helpful. Thanks Joe!
5 Kinda funny giving a UPS Store a 5 star review... Well, they were by far the friendliest and most welcoming people I've ever interacted with in a place of business such as this. I'd go out of my way, and did, to utilize this store's services.
5 Great store, I have my mailbox here.  The owner is a nice gentleman.  Joe provides personable and professional customer service.  It is conveniently situated next to an Albertsons.  The only drawback is that the parking lot does get quite full at times.
