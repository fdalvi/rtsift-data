3 For eleven months of the year this place is one of the Edinburgh Uni's Student Unions, but during the Festival in August it's a really popular and well-used venue for comedy and music shows.  It's a small venue, I'd say it seats around 20-30 with more room for a standing at the back, so if you're going to see a show here you should get there early! That said, the reason I gave it 3 stars and not 4 is how cramped it is. Even if you do get there early enough to be far enough forward in the queue for a seat, if you're bigger than the average hobbit you'll struggle with the lack of leg room.   And this is also where being small is a disadvantage - although you get much more intimate performances here, it'll also be 30oC and really smelly by the time the interval comes around.  Which is just as well - there's a bar adjoining the theatre so you can cool down with something cold and alcoholic, and not even have to walk more than a few metres for the privilege. If that bar is full, during the Fringe there's always a beer garden set up in the courtyard outside which is a gorgeous suntrap during August.
4 Pleasance Theatre is THE place to be when the Edinburgh Festival is on in August.  For most of the year, Pleasance is used as a student union for Edinburgh University and it is good place to have lunch or to go to with friends for a drink.    When the festival comes to Edinburgh in the August of each year, the Pleasance Theatre comes alive and it is always absolutely packed.  Although the venue is relatively small in comparison to the other Theatre's in Edinburgh, with a capacity of about 30, the queue's for going to see a show at Pleasance always stretch far back.  This could be in part due to the intimacy of the Theatre which makes it so popular with the festival goers.  However, with the intimacy comes one draw back - the place tends to get rather cramped and so it is a fairly sweaty experience!  But luckily there is a bar nearby to get drinks during a show.
