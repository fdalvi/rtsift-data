4 In lieu of my ongoing scrapbooking addiction, I am always on the prowl for new and exciting places to shop. I heard about this place a while back, and finally made it up to check this place out.   Its located off the Greenway-Hayden loop and Frank Lloyd Wright blvd in Scottsdale in a business type complex. its not your typical shopping mall store, and if you didn't know it was there, would probably never drive by it.   I checked the website out, and its a nice site. Hours, location, classes, etc. They have a nice selection of stamping stuff, stickers, and scrapbooking supplies to make any scrapper or stamper happy. its not the biggest store, but definitely carries quality supplies. They offer classes and workshops, which is standard for most places these days.   Something I noticed about this place was they didn't seem to have a Saturday night crop....only Friday night crops. That's surprising to me as most scrapbook, okay, all the scrapbook stores I know do Friday AND Saturday night crops. I'm not sure why they would do that, as most of these classes are very popular. That's something that's a bit of a turnoff to me as I enjoy going to weekend crops, especially during the holiday season to get caught up on my own stuff, AND do other projects as well.   Also they have a lab upstairs here. I don't know how that works with getting supplies, but for as cool as it is, I don't know that climbing stairs 700 times to get supplies really excites me. I know its out of their control, as its not a custom built location for them, BUT it could pose issues to those who may have walking issues or whatnot. For me, its more of a general observation and could be a problem for others.   Overall, I enjoyed my time here, and will likely return for supplies in the future!
1 This store is closed as of 2/10.  Another one bites the dust!!! Damn this economy thing....
