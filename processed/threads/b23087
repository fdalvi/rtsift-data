1 This post office provides the worst customer service! I know that's not saying much for any government run organization, but honestly...I thought postal workers had to pass a test or something in order to qualify...Basic Listening Skill trainings need to be implemented immediately!   I recently moved and submitted my change of address. I have been in my home for a little over 3 weeks and I have yet to receive 1 piece of mail. I called in to figure out where my mail is and the lady who answered the phone (after a wait time of 30 minutes) says, "oh that house is vacant" Um...how can that be if I'm calling about my mail not arriving...wouldn't that mean I'm living there now? "Oh, well you will need to find out where your mail is being sent." Uh, yeah, that's why I'm calling the POST OFFICE - It's not like my mail is being sent to another location as this is the main post office for my area, and it's not like the loan documents have the wrong address...they want me to come into the location - which conveniently closes before I get off work and fix the problem. I just hope when I come in I can get it all straightened out...   Where is my freedom to choose my own post office location? I hate government workers...no offense to the competent ones, but you have to realize you are the minority...
