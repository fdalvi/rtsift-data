4 Hidden away at the end of Rossie Place off Easter Road is a rather useful food wholesaler. It is all the things that in the supermarket like nearby Sainsbury's Meadowbank would be classed as world foods. Big bags of rice, lentils and spices and a stock of canned goods that would keep any oncoming apocalypse believers happy. There's also a good selection of fresh fruit and veg some very ordinary and some quite exotic.  I was told about it by a friend and admittedly took a while to find it. Ignore google which is slightly wrong, its not actually as far north. Simply head down Rossie Place, last exit on the left then first right. It looks like a large warehouse but you will soon see the large boxes of fruit and veg.  I find it useful for stocking up on ingredients for curries, reasonably priced veg and occasionally getting something I wouldn't normally eat.
4 I love you, Razwan! Great deals on fresh produce and spices, paneer cheese, yogurt and Asian-style snackfoods. There's a halal butcher at the back but I don't eat meat. The prices are extremely reasonable. Two punnets of strawberries for a pound? A whole box of tomatoes for Â£2.99? Yes please! They are friendly folks too. Enjoy.
