3 Walk away with plenty of bargains at this wholesale shoe store. But fair warning! Blink and make you might miss it. This little bargain shoe store at the intersection of N. 16th St. and E. Camelback Rd. is tucked away in the corner of a tiny little strip mall.  On the day of my visit everything was $9.99 and some were even $4.99, despite the "and up" disclaimer on the sign out front. Almost everything I looked at was made of synthetic fabrics, though with modern styling. Their biggest issue right now might be the limited stock of sizes. Catch it on a good day and you might find a cute pair of foreign-made, synthetic fabric shoes.  I would use the clich√© "don't walk, run." but the truth is you might be better off walking. Parking is tight and you'll probably have a new pair of shoes on your feet, anyway.
4 Need a deal or a steal this is the shoe place to come bare foot in. All items in the store are $9.99 or less. Majority at that bargain price but the shoe sales are as low as $5.99.   Now you get what you pay for. There tall, short, flat and trendy but the quality is not going to be top notch but we as women often where a pair of shoes for a special occasion and then we toss them in the closet. My shopping experience here and in the past has been for Summer wedges. I score each time finding a cute pair of the perfect summer wedges each time. They do the trick and service the purpose. I mean it is not Summer all year round so it is worth the visit.   Customer service is not bad. Your greeted as soon as you come in and that is about it. This is not a store you really need help in. Everything is out on the floor neatly stacked under a display table. Pretty simple as that.   Now let me add this is a ladies and young ladies shoe store only. Sorry guys you'll have to stop in to by your sweetheart a gift.
