4 Great Service! Came same day I called.  Explained everything that he did. Charged me exactly what I was quoted. Excellent!
5 I was so scared when I needed to find someone to fix  my garage door. I found Calvary on the BBB website and cross checked here. I am very happy I called.  I set up a time for them to come out and they gave me an hour window for the arrival. They not only came in the window they also called to say they were on the way. Randy was friendly and explaned every single thing that was wrong. He was able to fix everything and gave me a good price.  I am so glad I called AZ Calvary and would recomend them to anyone.
5 I am very VERY pleased with the service and professionalism and pricing I experienced with Calvary Garage Doors.    My tenant in El Mirage had a garage door that was off the track and needed new springs.  The tenants called another company (beware of scammers!) and they went out and charged a $29 service fee, then got on the phone with me and wanted $700 for the repair and spring replacement.  While on the phone, their price dropped from $700 to $600 to $500 and was going lower, but I didn't want to deal with those people.  Randy went out and did the job in the low $200's.  He charged me a fair price for doing an excellent job, and I would recommend his service to anyone needing garage door repair, installation, etc.  THANKS!    Terri
