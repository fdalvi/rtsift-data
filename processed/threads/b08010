1 Creepy customers.
2 One of the scarier gas station's I've been to in my day. Not in the best neighborhood and the clientele is evidence of this. Was harassed by not one but two homeless men as I walked in. While I usually wouldn't fault the store for this, these men where standing directly infront of the front doors in clear view of both employees and their manager and were not asked to leave. While waiting in line two men behind me got into a very loud verbal altercation which must be commonplace because the cashiers and manager didn't bat an eye. Yikes. The reason I give them 2 stars is due to the fact they're equipped with more gas pumps then your typical gas station and if that's all you need its betted than going across the street to AMPM and paying a 35 cent service fee for lesser quality gas.
