4 I've been going here for a couple of years now. They recently redid the place, painting the walls a nice shade of purple, got all brand new foot spas, and hung some new art.   They offer all the usual services, nail sets, manis, pedis, waxing...  It's a great bunch of women who work here. They're all very nice, gentle and polite. I've never had a bad experience.
4 I had a great experience here! I came in as a walk in on last Thursday morning and I only had to wait 10 mins before they could start my fill. Lisa did an amazing job! I am always worried that my fingers are going to get beat up cause they always tend to slip with the drill and cut my fingers but here that was NOT the case. They took very good care of me and my sensitive fingers, my nails look perfect, and even though its been a week they look like they were just done yesterday, no lifting by the edges or anything! As if my experience wasn't good enough, they even gave me a bottle of their mani/pedi lotion as a gift when I left! I love that stuff! I most definitely will be coming back!! Perfect first visit!
4 The girls at Splendid are the best and very professional. The experience was totally pain free in a warm and relaxing atmosphere. Would recommend them without hesitation.
