3 I would definitely say that New Look store in Edinburgh has changed a lot from what it last looked like. Before it was very hidden away but now its more open and light and refreshing looking. The staff are helpful and friendly and they sell lots of different types of clothing from short mini skirts to suit wear. They have mensware, womens and childrenware. I really like the accessorise range from bags to jewellery to scarfs. There is a carpark near by so good easy access. Very clean looking store, definitely a nice place to shop for clothes.
2 today was bad. seriously pathetic. I've eperienced better service from this store and others.    1. when trying to look for someone on the shop floor - NO ONE could be seen.  not even at the doors.  2. I was looking at the inspire range for belts and they only had one after i enquire at the till after standing in LOooooooong queue.  3. not once, not twice but three times the lady at the till buzzed for other staff members to come and reduced the queue and even after a forth buzzer no one came - pathetic.  Really felt sorry for the lass as i've been in that situation and it's not nice.    I did get a belt though rather please with myself.   The store did need a tidy up though.
