5 Sarah Butterfly attended my third child's birth which was the first homebirth I've ever experienced. Throughout my care she was available 24/7 to answer questions and sometimes just offer a pep talk. At 41 weeks, 5 days my third baby decided to come. I didn't think I was in labor but Sarah somehow just knew to come. Her and her birth assistant and midwife in training, Ada, were amazing at just knowing what I needed when I needed it with little direction from me. Sarah is very non interventionalist, and trusts the birth process and the mother's instinct like nobody I have ever met. I can't imagine how I would have gotten through the pregnancy without her calming presence, reassuring words, and complete faith in me and my body. If you feel your ob/gyn isn't listening to you, or you're tired of being pressured into certain "norms", Sarah is the perfect choice for you. She is amazing and I cannot say enough good things about her!!!! I could have had a hospital birth and zero out of pocket expense but I chose to switch to her and never looked back. Its a decision I could not be more happy with, and I'm sure you'll feel the same!!!
5 Sarah Butterfly (and assistant Ada) attended both my sons' home births. I felt supported and safe throughout my pregnancies, labors and postpartum. When met with obstacles; like unexplained bleeding, questionable ultrasounds, three days of labor, trouble nursing, Sarah was always there with knowledge, guidance and encouragement...and I have two beautiful, healthy, happy babes to show for it!
