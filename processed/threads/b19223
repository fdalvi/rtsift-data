3 Nice patio, for the summer. Often times they have live music both inside and outside, the menu is typical pub fare, nothing out of the ordinary. I would say the pricing, is a little high up, and a little to much for beer/ liquor.
3 Decent food. Ice cold beer. Chillin atmosphere
4 This place is great and a Kitchener classic bar.  For sports they have the big games on all the LCD screens. The Food is always good and they have great deals everyday.
