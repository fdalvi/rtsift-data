5 Really nice atmosphere and decor. I was driving around and found this place. The people are so nice and they do a good job too! Would definitely come back, i've recommended this place to all my girlfriends =)
5 I've tried a number of nail spas in my area, but I always return to Bliss.  Tina and the girls are always pleasant and do a very good job on the pedicures.  Comfortable 'spa' chairs massage your body as you relax and read a magazine supplied by the spa or a book you've brought.  I've been going here for 3-4 years and will continue to give them my business.
4 Nice, clean, relaxing nail salon. I was a walk-in and they were pleasant about it. Good selection of magazines and they played spa music in the background.   I would have given 5 stars, but I really had a hard time picking out a polish for my pedicure. The colors were so dark!  There were hardly any bright colors. I wanted something that was fun and cute, not dark and serious.   I'll go back, but I'll bring my own bottle of polish with me.
