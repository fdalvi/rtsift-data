5 Tess Emerson is an awesome stylist. I found her on groupon and have been seeing her ever since for all my grooming needs. She found the color that suits me best and maintains my color and cut perfectly. She is extremely talented, and I always love her recommendations, haircuts, color, and styles. I've never had a bad experience with her and trust her with my hair care. I've only ever had 2 stylists in my life that I've seen routinely and she is one of them. I would definitely recommend her to anyone looking for a stylist that will help them find their beauty protocol. She is very flexible with scheduling and services and is my go to for haircare!
5 Tess is an incredible stylist. I was so impressed by the care and precision she took while doing my hair, and I'm picky! She made sure my color and cut was perfect so I left happy. I will definitely be back!
5 Tess is an incredible stylist and too sweet!! I'm so thankful to have finally found a great stylist, she takes her time and truly cares.
