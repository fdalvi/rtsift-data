2 I was forced to finish my contract with Terminix once they bought my smaller pest control company last year. I can tell that Terminix is a HUGE company which has its pros & cons. One very annoying shortcoming is that the company highly advertises their termite program which is extra. Even though I continuously inform their Reps that I do NOT own my home, they are adamant that I pay for termite protection to the point of out right harassment. I receive phone calls every two weeks trying to get me to pay for termite protection. I will not be a returning customer once my contract expires.
1 Apparently there was a closing bill on a home I had lived in before the one I am living in now.  I used Terminix at both homes.  Apparently they are not bright enough to send the final bill to the new address they were servicing.  The bill went to collections and the collection agency figured out my new address within a month.  I paid the bill promptly upon receipt and filed a dispute with the credit agencies, BBB, and FTC.  They dropped my service at my new home (even though I had no "payment issues" with the services provided at my new home).  Which was fine, except I was really looking forward to firing them once the billing issue was resolved.  During all the drama I endured from this, a lady at TERMINIX told me that the service system had been updated but not the billing.  I am not sure how that's my problem.    Here's a little advice TERMINIX, when a customer moves you may want to update the billing address, especially when you are continuing service at their new home.  As for the quality of the service, well, I still killed 13 scoprions on my own last year during Terminix's service tenure by hunting them at night and deploying my own poison.    Not impressed
1 One star is much too generous for this company!  We have had a contract with Terminix since 2008, that we are cancelling today.  Their service is terrible.  The technicians show up unannounced, do not knock on the door or ring the doorbell, spray the front door and the garage door & leave.  Our back yard needs to be sprayed!!!  The last "service" they had documented never happened.  We live in a guard-gated community that logs when anyone comes in or out.  Terminix said they were here March 1st, but they didn't leave a slip in the door, and our gate has no record that they were anywhere on property that day.  I spoke with a technician today that said my phone appeared to be disconnected, or they had the wrong number.  The guy did not dial the correct area code!!!  Worst service ever from the pathetic managers to the technicians!!!  The only thing Terminix is good at killing off is their own business!!!
1 Find another company!  I went online and registered. They gave me a Monday morning 7-9 am appointment. I waited on Monday until 10:00 to call the "local" number of 702-802-0150 only to be transferred to the "national call center." They saw the "problem" with my appointment and stated they would transfer me to the local manager.  After 15 minutes they could NOT get anyone so they stated they would leave a message and have them get back to me.   This is BS. This is NOT how you do business. When I call the local office, I expect the local people to answer and take care of me.  I will find another company since Terminix obviously does not want my business with this kluge of a system that does NOT work.
