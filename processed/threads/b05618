5 I was in Las Vegas for vacation when I was told that my tail lights were not working. Since I didn't have first hand experience with any local mechanics or repair shops, I looked on Yelp and a couple other sources of online reviews. At the first place I went to, the owner said that they were completely booked up for the next two days. He referred me to another shop which also turned out to be too busy. The next place I went was GAS Auto Electric. They told me that they no longer do auto repairs but they referred me to Moore's Superior Automotive which was right close by. The address says Wyoming Ave. but the shop entrance is around the corner on Fairfield which is the cross street.  These guys were absolutely great. They immediately got to work on the repair and in less than fifteen minutes the problem was fixed. They also checked all the other external lights, front and rear to make sure everything was working correctly. No BS, just good, honest service. And their prices were more than fair. Based on my experience, I can confidently recommend them for the next time your car needs repair.
4 Just had an oil change and a tire rotation done and it was great friendly service.  I was referred by a friend and I am glad he referred me.  Seems like a great shop to get some basic work done at, with good service and good rates.
