3 It's a typical smoothie place you find at a mall. Nothing spectacular and by no means is it a Jamba Juice. It's good, but average.   They use fresh fruit in the smoothies, but I've also seen them use powder. I always go for the coconut pineapple orange smoothie with a protein add on. It's a good meal replacement and I'm always full after finishing it. A lot of their smoothies have bananas in them, which I hate, so I just stick to my norm. However, I have heard from my coworker that the strawberry banana smoothie is quite tasty and the banana flavor is not overpowering. I might try it one day if I'm feeling adventurous.  The staff that works here is a hit or miss. Some of them are nice people, but I've seen them get rude during busy times. And some of them are just rude. I come here because it's convenient and it's good. 'Nuff said.
3 Friendly and fast. They used real fruit. It was a refreshing change from soda.
4 I have been a fan of Surf City Squeeze since before I moved here from California, and seriously cannot remember if I've ever had anything other than the blueberry banana smoothie. I don't come that often, but when I do I can't stray from the most delicious blueberry concoction on the planet. A small size is perfect, and a medium is generous and filling enough for me to never order the large. I tend to buy it whenever I happen to be at Meadows Mall or going to Cardenas, but if you like blueberries try it. It is a foodgasm in your mouth. Based on how delicious it is I'd imagine the other things on the menu to be decent at the very least. But I'll let you find that out while I go have some more blueberry banana goodness...
