5 If I hadn't made an effort to visit a friend on this street I would have never known this place existed. It's a small underground furniture store with great surprises and amazing bargains. Most of its furniture are antiques and there is always a good deal to pick up.  My friend got this GORGEOUS old trunk suitcase she uses to keep her clothes in. Beats the plastic container boxes by far. They are constantly changing their stock and it's almost like a hidden treasure trove.   Well worth a look in if you are in the area!
4 Steptoes is really a cheap furniture shop and you can pick up a good number of decent items at very little cost to your pocket from here.  Whatever you want, be it a chair, table or desk you get a wide variety of choice from bog standard to slightly more special and all the way up to something a bit unique.  For example, they have a desk with a green fabric top like those old bank managers used to have as their desks for Â£100, which would be quite an item if cleaned up a bit (and by this mean a bit of polish and elbow grease).  Some of the items could use a bit of a polish and a clean, but the prices reflect this so a quick clean by your own hand will give you a bargain.
