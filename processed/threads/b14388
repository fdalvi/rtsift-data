4 When all the employees are wearing bright orange shirts it's never difficult to spot someone who works there.   There's always plenty of employees on site and prices are fair and sales are even better. I've gotten many, many shirts-both t-shirts and otherwise-for $6.   Sales differ throughout the season but I've found great deals Thanksgiving time and after. Better selection on clothing than the Anthem store too.
4 In AZ, this Nike store is only second to the Anthem store as far as shoe selection goes.  This store has more inventory as far as sizes go, but less variety.  The workers here are top notch.  I've never had any trouble asking for assistance when I needed it.    They also have great sales about 3-4 times a year.  Why pay full retail for Nikes at other places when you can get them here at a discount.  Make their clearance section your first stop when you walk in..
5 I buy about 3 or 4 pairs of j's a year just for hoopin... You can always find a pair for half the original price
2 Not much of a Nike Factory, I've been to better ones!
5 Sweet deals here! Mostly everything we bought was an extra 30% off the lowest ticketed price! Also spend over $100 get a $25 off purchases made on 1/1-2/2 spend $200 get $50 off! Sweeeet!! They had my size for shoes (7) which is hard to find when there are sales because it's so common, but they were fully stocked here! Got shoes for every member of the family! Love it when my budgeting works with sales in the store! The sales people were nice and were very helpful and lines weren't super long and moved along very quickly. Also if you don't want to walk a long ways this store is in between JCp outlet and Ross! Will definitely be back to use that $50 off in January! Yay! :-)
4 This use to be a Nike Outlet, now they ha e turned it into a Nike Clearance and have added a ton of merchandise. It is awesome to get my favorite rinni my pants, Nike Legends for 24.99 instead of 90+. That being said some prices are still stupid.
