1 This is company is terrible. Their tables and chairs are in atrocious condition. They delivered 7 hours late and brought chairs covered in dirt. They did nothing to rectify the issue. Please do yourself a favor and never use this awful company.
5 This company was very helpful with our event that we recently had. The owner was very friendly and gave us quotes on everything which beat the other place that we had tried. The items were delivered on time without any issues. I would highly recommend them and will be using them again!
5 There are tons of companies doing rentals in Phoenix and I've used a few before but were never really that impressed. I contacted AZ event rentals and was treated great with getting quotes and making sure that they had the right equipment for my party. The tables, chairs and devices were in good working shape and dropped off on time. If you're looking for a good company that doesn't BS around give AZ Event rentals a try.
