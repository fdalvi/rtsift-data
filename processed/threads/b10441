4 Good pizza and it was ready in 20 minutes, as promised. I ordered via phone, so not sure how well they take online orders. I didn't use a coupon, although I wish I had one. It cost me $23 for 2 large 1-topping pizzas.  Pizza was good, as always. This location is recommended.  Note: It's in the Target shopping center.
4 Their online ordering system is extremely easy. I see advertisements at these Holnwon pizza places for eight dollars and nine dollar large pizzas we can't really go wrong if the pizza hut pizza is $5.55. The food was ready by time I got there as promised.  The old lady at the cash register was really nice. And I feed my family for under 10 bucks and look like a champ while doing it.
5 I decided to order Blake 's smokehouse BBQ pizza. Because I wanted to try it.   So I waited 15 minutes. And I'm glad I ordered it,  the pizza was so good.   I love how the BBQ sauce melts with the cheesy pizza. I would definitely come back.
