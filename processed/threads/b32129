3 OH YES I DID!  I have to give this Aliberto guy some credit. While your favorite brand of engineered beverage, personal hygiene liquid, or processed food snack is proudly helping you through the recession by offering 11.5 oz of product in the same 14 oz container- this guy sticks to the game plan.  You can still get the original 3,500 calorie taco salad for less than six bucks, and the Beef Chimichanga STILL comes with a heart stalling wad of shredded beef, fajita vegetables, and fried tortilla smothered in alarming portions of sour cream, guac, and cheese. They are just too legit to quit.  This Aliberto's is also family owned- Mom, Dad, Uncle, two son's and a daughter all work here. And the place is squeeky clean inside. All of the ingredients in the requisite Burrito fixins' bar are always fresh- sliced cucumbers, limes, carrots, red and green sauce.  ...and you can get the ice cold bottles of Coke from Mexico that have real cane sugar. So, it's (ahem) actually healthy.
4 Darn good Mexican food in huge portions and a reasonable price. Although the staff might not all speak fluent English, they're always polite. It's a family owned and operated business, too!
2 ya wife likes the place, i found it to be funky tasting chicken beans not good   mama not that friendly she was more friendly to my wife
4 I had the rolled tacos. Heavenly!!! With ample guacamole and sour cream and shredded cheese.  And the price can't be beat.
