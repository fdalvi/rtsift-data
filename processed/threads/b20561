3 Located in Ocean Terminal, this branch of Fat Face is very well organised, bright and airy with friendly staff which makes all the difference. I feel like I've grown out of shops like Fat Face but I did notice a good selection of bikinis, swimsuits and other holiday wear that was excellent quality.   The prices are quite reasonable for the quality and they often do good sales too.
