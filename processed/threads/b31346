2 Let the Buyer Beware!  I went here because I found a bunch of posts and pics of nice looking furniture on Craigslist.  I picked out a used bookcase for $60 and negotiated to 50.  When I got it home, I noticed quite a bit of water damage and within an hour, my office smelled old and musty.  When I called to ask about a refund, I was told that the piece I purchased had another bookcase in the set and the other one didn't smell.  I was told that all sales were final.  So, add that to the fact that LVAT charges $1.25 to swipe your credit/debit card...I will not be back nor will I ever recommend this company.  Spend a few extra bucks and go somewhere else.
1 The thing about it is.... albert is a crook i bought a very high priced desk and he said it would take about a week to get here. (charged my card that day) a week went by no desk no phone call to even say that there was a problem. Albert then let me know there was a problem that it will be next week. Meanwhile my employee has no desk. So we patiently wait another week again no desk no phone call. At this point I just wanted my money back. Albert refused to give me the money back. Finally, I settle with the floor model at the same price as the new one but my employee will have a desk. Albert then delivers the desk (no keys says he will mail them ya right)  and he accidently brought the hutch with it, I was assuming that it was for all of our troubles and not getting a new desk. He then blows my phone up wanting his hutch now or he will get crazy in our office (wow). This is still going on please please don't by anything from this guy
