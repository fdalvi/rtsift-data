5 For the full effect see my review on Palo Verde Animal Hospital in Phoenix.  I took my dog to Dr. Grant after a very bad experience the day prior. Let me tell you guys: Jesus himself couldn't sing higher praise for Dr. Grant and his team at Glenfair. That man and his assistants have a way with animals that is unprecedented in this city. And the best part is their incredibly reasonable prices.   My verdict? This is the only place that I will be taking my animals to. They really are that good. When you factor in the incredibly reasonable prices, you have the recipe for one of the best kept secrets in Phoenix!
5 The people at Glenfair Veterinary Hospital are fantastic. The price for any service here is easily one-third of anywhere else, and the service you receive is genuine. They truly care about your pets and you can feel it the minute you walk in the door. I live in East Phoenix, but I'll drive the 30 minutes to give Glenfair my business.
5 Great vet and assistants.  Made Jock comfortable this was his first visit.  Will return again.
5 I can't say enough amazing things about this vet. Dr Grant is amazing. He has been seeing our dogs for a couple of years, today we had to make the tough decision to put one of our boys to sleep. Dr. Grant was so informative and willing to do whatever we chose and not milk us dry financially. I would highly recommend this office and Dr. Grant.
