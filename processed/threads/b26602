1 Canceled my service in Feb 2, 2011 They kept charging me and took money out of my bank account. Called them to fix it and they couldn't. Something was wrong with their system. My account is frozen with an error and no one can overwrite it or fix it. They kept charging me until JULY, that's 6 months. Call almost every month and wasted 45-60 mins with them on the phone trying to get my refund. Been transferred so many times I think I spoke with the whole damn company. Finally after almost a full year in Jan 2012 got my refund. With no apology and no interest for having my money for 11 months. Some F up shit. HATE this company. STAY FAR FAR AWAY~!
1 Worst company I have ever had the misfortune of having to deal with. A salesman told me internet would cost $30/month. They called back 2 days later to offer me internet for $45/month plus the cost of a router. Finally, a few hours later I was told it would be $50/month. I will never deal with century link for anything due to the incompetence of their employees.
1 I was conned into Centurylnk service.Lied to in every way imaginable. Paid for 10M and only got 1 at any given time.THEN they charged me $250 to cancel my service. ASSHOLES
