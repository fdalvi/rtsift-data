5 Tasty, somewhat gourmet sandwiches.  Hot.  Cold.  You name it.  Great little sides as well.  Subway this place is not.  Also, doubles as a respectable little deli.  If you didn't think you spending enough money on cheese, stop in here and buy some $14 havarti.
5 Simply mah-vo-lis. Divine sandwiches and deli salads. They can be a little slow with the hot sandwiches but are well worth the wait. Besides, you get to play Trivial Pursuit while you wait. And I always buy my cheese there...and then buy some wine down the street at Barriques.
4 Just had my first lunch here.  I chose the avocado BLT and a cup of their squash soup. $6 and it hit the spot.  The soup was a little too sweet and I couldn't finish it, but the BLT was perfect.  I didn't try the cheese, but will next time.  Service was prompt considering there wasn't an empty seat in the house. 4 stars.
