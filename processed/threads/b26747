5 Very impressed. I've had this company do landscaping work on a few of my rental properties, and I've never been disappointed.  They're prompt, professional, and I have yet to get any unexpected "extras" on my bills.  Another plus? While they do have spanish speakers available, they speak English! In this day in age I totally appreciate being able to actually talk to the owners of the company I'm going to place my trust in.
3 Out of the 11 landscape companies I called, Clean Sweep was one out of two that actually answered the phone. And out of the 2, they were the only company that called me back after I asked for a quote. They would have gotten 4 stars because they did really good work in a short amount of time however, It was like pulling teeth to schedule a time with them. Their office seems a little disorganized as to the fact they did not follow up with me as to this each time I called.  So overall good work (see before and after pics) but a little slow on the follow through.
1 if I could give these people no stars i would.  they are bunch of liars and  con artists.  DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE!!!  i started monthly service for lawn and pool maintenance  with them 2 weeks ago they and promised e they will service that thursday.  I called them and asked if they did  they told  me yes since i live in LA i sent my brother to check what they had done and they had NOT touched a thing! I called  them back i told them they didn't service anything and they said ohh we made a mistake we will be there wednesday and still no service again i called the they tell me they have serviced my pool and lawn but not even one leaf is touched!!! then he proceeded to insult me by saying that they did service and he will cancel my service because he didn't need my "little house" These people are unprofessional and don't deserve to be in business
