3 This is just another casino bar that has two sides to it. The reason I am reviewing it is because of the Thursday Pub Crawl. Its the 2nd stop of the night from 8-9 you get any drink for $1. Well we already had a few at Mermaids but we were still not quite where we wanted to be yet buzz wise so we ordered a round from the nicest bartender. He was great at what he made and easy on the eyes. We ordered several more drinks from him and had a blast at the bar. It was a festive mood & everyone was enjoying the drinks. The Silverton is wise to have such a great weekly event!
4 I've come here on a few occasions, usually while waiting for a table at Twin Creeks or just to sit and get a drink with friends after having getting our fill at one of the restaurants and having an after meal drink. The bar stools are a nice change of pace. Comfortable and welcoming. Always happy to have a comfortable seat while having a drink. The service is pretty good as well. Silverton always has great drink specials and this place doesn't disappoint.
4 Love this poker bar when it's not teeming with smokers. The decor is funky and the color changing lighting is awesome. Big, comfy chairs guarantee you will be here a while. The draft beer selection is decent- Anchor Steam, Stella, Blue Moon.  Years ago when this bar opened, they featured speciality cocktails that were very good. I always forget to ask if they still serve them. The bar is 2 sided, with poker machines on both sides. And it's centrally located within the casino.
