5 Dr. Tenby has been our twins doctor since they were born. I am very satisfied with the care he gives. He is also understanding to all my "could they have..." and does a great job answering our questions and explaining what is actually going on with our kids both health wise and in development. (When one gets sick... we just wait for it and in a day or two they are both sick).   If you're searching for a great pediatrician, then you, in my opinion, will be comfortable in visiting Dr. Tenby.
4 I take my children to this doctor's office, They see Dr. Tenby.  I love him as their doctor. Makes you feel very comfortable and easy to talk to when you have questions or concerns and doesn't look at you like a crazy person. The office and exam rooms are always clean and the nurses are always pleasant & helpful. Especially, when I have to hold down my daughter for her shots. Great prices for office visits. Since I pay cash and have no insurance, it's a great place just in case you don't. Would recommend this office and Dr. Tenby.  And it's always very easy to get an appointment, even last minute.
5 Dr. Tenby has been there for our family for 9 years.  From premature birth, to major car accident recovery, to chronic conditions and typical childhood illness, Dr. Tenby has helped get our kids healthy with compassion and competence.  His sense of humor is also a big plus!
