5 This place just opened up in my neighborhood so I decided to give it a try. I just got a "swedish" massage, though they offer acupuncture, craniosacral, and a number of other therapies. I must say that it was one of the best massages of my life! For days I really felt like I was healthier, somehow. I know, it sounds weird, but its true! There are many therapists here, each with a specialty.
5 I have been to AZ Therapy Center 4 times already for acupuncture. It is a relaxing, soothing environment that  promotes your mind and body to heal. Just walking in you feel less stressed out! The staff is great and very friendly. I would recommend this place for anyone that has an open mind to natural healing. They do massage, and all sorts of homeopathic treatments. (The prices are extremely competitive too!)
5 Unfortunately a-z Therapy Center no longer exists but I am still practicing Acupuncture and Asian Medicine at Kai-Zen,  a Creating Wellness Center.  480.941.2147.  We have a team of excellent practitioners in the fields of Medical Massage, Chiropractic's, Physical Therapy, and Aesthetics and we also accept Insurance.  Come check out our relaxing and healing environment and let us restore your body to optimal functioning! Annette Raddatz L.Ac
