3 I went to try this place since the Review Journal listed it as a Dallas Cowboy bar and let me tell you this place is tiny. The place sits right in front of  a motel and seems as though it was meant for truckers and those staying at the motel. When I say this place is tiny, I mean maximum occupancy of 12, and that's counting the bartender. You could probably wash your hands in the bathroom from the bar stool if you reached far enough j/k. If you just want to grab some drinks during the game, this place has $2 shots of Jack and cheap beer, just don't expect any food because honestly they barely have enough room for an extra bar stool, let alone a kitchen. The bartender was friendly and the random truckers that come in are sometimes more entertaining than the game itself. A good spot if you're looking for some cheap Jack.
5 I love this place. The new owner Mike is pretty awesome. Great local dive bar. I highly recommend this place.
4 Fun if you are into a divey weird joint w a good jukebox where you for sure won't see anyone you know!
5 Should be voted best local dive bar!!! Awesome bartenders,  excellent service,  great ppl to hang with. Sometimes a laid back country feel,  sometimes cool classic rock... Really chill, fun place,  COME ON DOWN Y'ALL!!!!
