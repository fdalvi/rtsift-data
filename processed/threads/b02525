5 Love this place.  Ask for Shane he is awesome.
1 I cannot comment on their products because I never made it in the nursery! The way that I was treated on the phone was horrible! I was placed on hold for 6 minutes and 31 seconds and when she came back to the line, she had forgotten why she put me on hold in the first place!
5 I went into treeland looking for something they didnt have and they kindly pointed me in the right direction!  THey could have easily turned me away and left me bewildered but they didnt and i REALLY appreciate that.  Even though I never actually purchased from them I WILL in the future when I am looking for a new outdoor plant.  Thanks guys!
5 So far all of my experiences with Treeland have been great.  If I've ever had questions about a certain type of tree not common to the area they have been able to help me out when other nurseries staff lacked the knowledge and interest.  Treeland also has great prices for contractors and consumers.  I've had a hard time getting other nurseries to match their prices... which only came up since the other nursery was right by the job I had.  If I'm putting a new tree in the ground at my home, it's coming from Treeland!
