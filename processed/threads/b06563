5 No pushy sales BS and a good price on the front-loader that we bought - went to Menards after and found the exact model for $300 more.
1 Bought a washer/dryer and refrigerator from the store on Stoughton Rd. (Madison) in spring of 2012.  Shortly after purchase, the washer door was not latching properly.  A service technician came out and "fixed" it, but it took a return trip to get the job done.  A week before the one-year warranty expired on the refrigerator, the stainless steel handle on the freezer drawer snapped off.  Because I called *3 days* after the warranty expired, Brothers Main wants to charge $95 for the service call, plus the cost of the replacement part.  These were not low-end appliances, nor do I believe we've been particularly rough on them.  We expected better quality and better customer service from a store that prides itself on not being one of the "big boxes." :(
