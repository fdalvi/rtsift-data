4 A parade is a parade is a parade. I love a parade.  The City of Henderson always orchestrates a great party. The parade lasted about an hour then the events plaza has been converted into a carnival midway with all the games,rides and food stands.  The El Dorado has set up a stand with corned beef & cabbage plus green beer. There's more than a dozen beer & food stands selling all your fair staples.  The main stage has live entertainment throughout the day and everyone is having a grand old time.  Bring the kids and head out to Henderson-Sunday is the last day.  If you missed it check out the parade & more @ http://offthestripdining.blogspot.com/2009/03/st-patricks-day-festivities.html
5 Went here this past weekend and it was a great time! lots of cool things to see and do here on water street. Started the morning with some kick-ass Danish and coffee from Flemming's Bakery, grabbed a spot on the curb and watched the parade go by...  Politicians, pageant winners, local businesses and organizations, FOX 5 News Team, car clubs, high schools, dance troops, and even characters from Star Wars! Something for everyone, and great fun for the family....ALOHA!!!
2 The annual st. patrick's day festival on water street in Henderson. The thing about a lot of these festivals is that they all are the same. You have a mini carnival for the kids with rides and booths of funnel cakes and hot dogs. There is a whole lot of vendors peddling stuff. And there is food and live music. The reason why this place only gets 2 stars is that I wish everything would have been more St. Patrick-esque. I get that you have to have the carnival stuff for the kids. But, as an adult (or so I believe I am), when you go to a holiday festival like this one, I would like to see places selling celtic gear and corned beef and cabbage. I don't want to see native american jewelry and gyro's. Just saying... On another note, the rage hard rock music was awesome! I felt like joining the IRA after a couple of songs!!
5 I've been going to this festival for the past 8 years. It's great! Now that I have a child it's 10x more fun. This is by far Henderson's best event. There's a parade, food, rides, and games. There's all types of fun! We look forward to it every year!
