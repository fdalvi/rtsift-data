5 Great service!  Good place to get your i-Phone screen replaced!!  Talk to Donald - he'll take care of you.  Lots of accessory choices too.
5 Best place to go for any tech problems or accessories! Great selection of colored iphone screen glasses and iphone cases, as well as ipad cases and accessories. Donald can repair your phone for just about any damage that has occurred. I definitely recommend checking out the store and it's a great location, right off the 101!
5 What a life saver! The guy running this place, Donald, is an absolute gentleman. You should definitely go here and only here, regardless of how far away from it you are. It took him all of 8 minutes to bring my phone back to life. I wish I could rate it 10 stars.
