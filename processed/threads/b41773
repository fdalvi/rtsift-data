5 I've done a review of this place 3 times and they never show up.. But I want it to stick around because the food is amazing the smoothies are great and the prices are better. My entire work has sort of flooded this place with business lately and I can't tell enough people how awesome it is. Keep your eyes peeled it's sort of tiny tucked between two other stores.
3 The smoothie I had was delicious.  The salad was terrible.  But who orders a salad at a smoothie place?!?  I should have just stuck with the smoothie only.
5 Great smoothie shop!! One size and good deals. It's a nice change from all the trendy smoothie/juice shops that charge an arm and a leg for a small drink....ugh I'm a sucker for those drinks! All their smoothies contain turbinado (sugar substitute) so I always request to leave it out. The fruit itself makes the drink sweet enough...Enjoy!!
1 What a horrible experience! Went to grab a peanut butter cup smoothie after a movie. The smoothie tasted like nothing but chocolate, banana and ice. There was no peanut butter flavor whatsoever! While scooping with a spoon, I discovered a large clump of peanut butter the size of a fist. I brought the smoothie back to the counter and asked them to re-blend it. The girl said that she would remake it for me. She still could not get the peanut butter to blend, then asked for assistance from the other employee, who decided that pouring tap water into my smoothie was a good idea to solve the problem. At that moment, I was done and asked for my money back.
