4 As the name suggests, this is quite a traditional pub. And if you're into your whiskies, then you'll be in heaven here as they have over 20 different types, ranging from the Highlands to as far afield as Japan.   If you're more of a real ale drinker, the good thing about this place is the constantly-changing selection of guest ales to choose from, alongside the two resident ones.  But there are lots of girl-friendly drinks to choose from too: their house wine is definitely among the nicer ones I've had a pub recently and the white is always nicely chilled.  The main thing I love about this place though has to be the food. If you're a student you get 10% off, and the portions are really generous so it's great value for money. Don't make the mistake I did though... you will not be able to finish the nachos on your own. Not if you plan on doing anything other than sleep for the rest of the day, anyway.   They also do really good burgers, and you build the exact combination of fillings yourself so you're bound to end up with one that you like. I've never had the sunday roast myself, but that's what i'll be having next time I go here, as my flatmates rave about it.  Why not five stars then? The music. The jukebox is purely punk/metal/gothic, and although it's not blasted really loud like most metal pubs, I just find it a bit of a weird combination with the traditional décor and mainstream food.  Don't let that put you off though... if I could have rated this 4 1/2 stars I would have.
4 I can't add anything to Fiona's review, she nailed it. Good place and the burgers a famous around these parts.  But The Edinburgh University Goth & Rock Society need to stop meeting in here, they've killed what was a perfectly good jukebox!!!
4 The Auld Hoose is excellent.  Located just off of the bustling hive of student frenzy that is the main streets of Newington, it offers a great alternative for those who often find themselves craving a change of scene from the mainstream unions and bars.    One of the things that dramatically stands out about this place is the music.  The jukebox is full of metal and rock, allowing a more subtle means of enjoying these genres than the more extreme establishments such as Opium on the Cowgate.   The choice of drinks here is vast, lots of ales and wines are available including Hobgoblin on tap! This offers a welcome relief from the common draught lagers that are usually prominent elsewhere. There is a great variety of wines, and the choices are handsomely presented on blackboards located within.    The food is great, and the large portions offer excellent value.  A particular highlight for me would be the nachos, they are HUGE. I went with three of my other guy friends, all of whom are large loons requiring a good feed, and we struggled to finish it. They come lashed with chilli, sour cream, guacamole and a generous quantity of cheese. Delicious. I haven't tried any of the other meals on offer but scrolling down the menu there are many traditional dishes such as fish and chips and steak pie.  I guess the main downside of this place is that it can sometimes seem a bit dark and claustrophobic when it gets busy. Finding seating usually isn't a problem unless you leave your arrival until quite late on Fridays or Saturdays. However, the music can sometimes be too loud and not to everyone's taste.
4 The Auld Hoose is a great pub, and despite being a off the beaten track, once found is a keeper. It is one of the few rock pubs in Edinburgh and this is immediately obvious upon entering and seeing the bar staff and customers. This is an advantage though, as there is always a community feel in there and you get very few obnoxious lads so it all lends itself to a pleasant drinking environment. This is only let down by the Jukebox; The Auld Hoose prides itself on having one of the only goth and rock jukeboxes in Edinburgh. I do love my punk and hardcore, but the music is just too loud, especially as the pub has a sit down and chat kind of vibe to it not get up and have a mosh. When the jukebox is turned down a bit though (very occasionally) it's a really good place to have a natter.  They also are proud to sell real beers, not just lagers. Yes you can get a Tennents if for some unknown reason you would actually want one but they have good ales as well and one of the best pints of Guinness around. There are good bottled ciders and also Crabbies.  But the jewel in the crown is that as soon as they heard Sailor Jerry was taking the Vanilla out of its rum they bought up a load of the old style bottles so it's one of the only places in Edinburgh to get the good Sailor Jerry before it turned rubbish. You will pay a bit more here than most places for a pint but as long as you go for a good one and not just some crappy lager then it's worth it.  The food is immense here as well. Students get a 10% discount but the reason it's so great is that it is huge. The plates are massive compared to other pub portions. The burgers are great as well, as is the Sunday lunch. They have platters which can easily fill two people and all for a reasonable price.   Overall it is a great pub, the only downside is that the music, whilst great if you like rock and metal, is just too loud. If you get there on one of the few days where it's turned down a bit then you will find yourself in one of the best pubs around
5 The Aulde Hoose is a hilarious combination of old man pub meets metal heads. In the best possible way. There are quite a few awesome things about this pub, one of them being that it's massive, so there's pretty much always a place to sit. Another being that it has a very very good selection of ales and cidres. And and and! They serve Cairn O'Mohr by the glass, though I normally go for the whole bottle (with friends!). Ahem.  Even though it's a massive space, relative to all the other good pubs in Edinburgh that tend to be quite tiny, it's not overwhelmingly huge and doesn't get obnoxiously loud. On tap, they've got a delicious cidre, the name of which escapes me, though I remember it being rare and tasty. They have Fraoch and Hobgoblin, too, which aren't that easy to find on tap anywhere in Edinburgh.   Definitely stop by the Auld Hoose if you're looking for somewhere full of delicious ales to have a drink. Especially if you're in a larger kind of group.
4 It was convenience that drew me to the Auld Hoose to start with, being as its located very close to a friend's house but boy am I glad it is.  We wanted somewhere close by to get something quick and easy to eat, and despite initial fears upon seeing the menus at the Auld Hoose, being both sparsely populated and plastic coated, there was really nothing to worry about.  The menu proudly claims that the nachos are "probably the biggest in Edinburgh" and four of us feeling adventurous chose to take on the challenge. Fortunately another two people turned up because these nachos... were HUGE. Seriously - go and check the picture I added. They happily fed six people. SIX GROWN PEOPLE! That;s ridiculous.  Happily it wasn't just quantity over quality, as the toppings on the nachos were pretty delicious, particularly the chilli itself. People at other tables seemed to be enjoying burgers and other assorted pub grub, and I'd happily come back to try any number of other things from the menu - which ranges from the aforementioned burgers to classics like Stovies and Haggis, Neeps and Tatties.  The Auld Hoose is first and foremost a bar though and there were a good deal of beers and ales on offer - not to mention an awesome metal jukebox and happily you don't need to be tatted from tête to toe to fit in - having come straight from work at the time I was *slightly* overdressed, but no one batted an eyelid in my direction. What a lovely place.  More places with HUGE food and less attitude please.
4 I had done a little research in my quest to try out some Real Ale pubs.  Any beer fan from the US and probably all of North America will understand the novelty and interest in cask conditioned beers.  The Auld Hoose came up in my research to be within walking distance to my hotel.  So, of course my first night in Edinburgh I made a beeline straight for this establishment.  It was early on a Wednesday evening so the place wasn't packed.  There were a few tables occupied and at that moment it was nice and quiet.  As I had expected, I had several real ales available to try.  Since I'm not local, I asked the bartender about my options and he happily helped me with my choice.  My group and I were only a little hungry so we thought we'd have a few items to share while enjoying our beers.     Ok so I'm from Texas which is arguably the world epicenter for tortilla chips, salsa and nachos.  Please don't laugh when you learn that yes I did order their nachos.  It was part curiosity and part frustration with my group's different eating preferences.  So yes, the Texan in Edinburgh kicked off his first night with...nachos.    If you've ever played Jenga, that's what these nachos reminded me of.  The sizable plate was stacked dangerously high.  Fortunately, the mass did not collapse and fall on the floor while we strategically snagged bites to eat.  You know what?  These nachos  were also pretty good.  Definitely not Tex-Mex, but still tasty and better than I had expected.  The other reviewers were spot on with the music played here. It's definitely not easy listening but it also wasn't being blasted either.  It was easy to have conversation.  So even if you're not a fan of heavier rock music, I don't think you'd be too put off visiting at this time of day.  My only complaint was the name. Every time I said the "Auld Hoose" it sounded like I was trying to speak with a very bad Scottish accent.  Actually, I secretly loved that part...hehe  This place delivered what I expected.  I got to relax for a bit, enjoy some real ales and snack.  This is a place to visit and visit again.
4 Of all the metal/rock/alternative bars I go to this is likely the one I nip into most. It is close to my work and next door to possibly my favourite Indian (Kismot) so it has an added convenience factor.  Recently repainted a more gothic inspired purple outside the Auld Hoose is also a proper pub, keeping good beer (Hoegaarden and real ale) and cider (Addlestones) and spirits.  The Hoose also provide some proper "Man Vs Food" style portions of tasty pub grub. The nachos clearly stand out but even the steak pie or chili will fill you to the brim. I also like the jukebox, it is the proper CD playing kind and has a little sign requesting that folks don't repeat an artist/tune meaning the music (while all industrial, rock, metal or goth) is ever changing.  So there we are, good drinks, food and music, go on give it a try.
5 Well kept beers, both regular and guest ales. A fine whisky list too.  Simple pub grub but in large portions for very reasonable prices. Beware, if ordering the large nachos bring friends, lots of them... A great metal/punk/industrial/goth juke box keeps the alternative crowd and student regulars happy.
5 This was my regular haunt while studying at the University of Edinburgh.  Couldn't be beat for a pint or a dram, and above all else their Mega Nachos.  So good they deserved capitalization.  I miss this place just thinking about it.  The bartenders felt like friends and the atmosphere was relaxed but upbeat.
5 No. I'm not a lagerboy  Well...more likely, not a "lager-auld-boy", if age still matters :)  My intention, going to the Auld Hoose, was to try a genuine and traditional Scottish Breakfast. The place looks happily aged and the people at the tables on the left of the entrance, under the direct daylight looked happy (and chatty) as well.  I went on the rightside (where daylight looked like an exotic promise) not because I love the cosy darkness, but because there I saw some smaller tables, good for a single tourist like me.  Before I was able to understand how the ordering policy was, a very friendly bartender was waving his hand asking me if I wanted something to drink (now I know that I should have ordered at the bar desk :/). Firstly I ordered the desired Scottish breakfast, then I asked him for an advice about beers and ales on tap. His answer was effective and tasty. He simply took two glasses, describing the flavours of a couple of hand pulled nectars he kindly pushed towards me. Both were delicious. I chose the Hobgoblin because I thought it could be the best option to drink with the breakfast. This choice made me desert the field of the lagerboys :)  The food was less memorable, but good enough. The slice of haggis was the best part of the dish, in my opinion.  Haggis has been a great surprise and a wonderful one. I never suspected that from those ingredients it was possible to create such a flavourful "delicatessen".  Great beers, good food, friendly atmosphere, music not too loud it's all what I was hoping to find, and I found it all.
4 Beer rocks  Never knew there was an awesome rock bar so close to my flat, and my life is better for it! So on the pub crawl with my Aberdonian chums, this is pub two, and it was a bit of a suck it and see approach. I knew it was somewhere near us and luckily we found it thanks to dumb luck, we were pleasantly surprised.  It's a traditional decor, dark wood with wee stools and archaic lamp shades. A long island bar with a glorious single real ale pump, serving nuclear craft ales, this session was Tiny Rebel's Hadouken, and it was like a drop kick in the face. The staff were suitably punk, and I'm not talking brew dog hipster punk either.  Now, the special thing here is the jukebox, its jam packed with some of the most awesome rock and punk albums ever, and one of my drinking companions could have spent a fortune on it. Lucky for him we were on a strict 2 beer max per pub rule.  I want to go back to this pub on a Friday night and meet some of the locals, I think this would lead to some great drinking stories. Awesome selection of shots etc also...
5 Nachos as big as 5 Yelpers faces!  On a Yelper Nacho-crawl, we ended up here. My first question was 'why had I not been here sooner?' Y'see, I was a total wee mini mosher in my day. I only didn't go to SOAD concerts for fear of being literally crushed in the mosh pits. I rarely indulge that side of my any more, but when I step into a bar and hear some good rockin' tunes on and some really ace staff who are friendly but chilled out, I feel at home.  A group of 10 of us descended to feast upon their epic sized nachos. I thought I had seen big food before. But nothing compared to the big nachos. For £10.95 they say they'll feed 3 - 4. Ha. I'd reckon 5 - 6.   The photos don't do them justice. Literally the biggest mound of nachos I have ever seen, heaped HIGH with chilli, and sour cream and guac. Cheese (really really GOOD cheese) melted across almost every layer. We ate for 20 minutes and it looked like we hadn't made a dent.  As David S said, Man V Food proportions. I can normally eat a hefty amount and feel fine, but I actually had flashbacks to being 5 years old and giving myself tummy ache from eating just a little too much.  Great value, and not scrimping on quality. Good beers and cider, friendly staff, and a kind of chilled out rock bar (rock music and rock staff, but not super loud music or super exclusive).  I'll definitely be back.
4 Is student friendly... Good prices on single malt... Don't miss the nachos!
4 Went to the Auld Hoose with a group of Yelpers in search of nachos.  Well, it wasn't much of a search, we had previously been informed that this place has the biggest nachos ever - seriously see the pictures!!  So I came armed with a hunger to match.  3 of us shared a bowl of these Mega Nachos that are suggested for 3-4.  They came pretty quickly and looked amazing when they did.  Great ratio of toppings to nachos, as so often there is just not enough.  Chilli beef, guacamole, sour cream and cheese throughout.  It took us a good 20 minutes or so to make a serious dent in the mound and start to get to the underneath layers, which were still hot.  After eating about a quarter of the bowl myself, I really should have stopped, but as I hate wasting food and the other 2 had had enough, I just kept shovelling it in....literally.....using the nachos to shovel up the toppings.  Big mistake.  When I finally finished all the toppings, apart from some jalapeños which are a little on the spicy side for my mild palate, there was a only a handful of nachos left.  About 15 minutes later, when I got up to use the bathroom, I realised just how full I was - serious muffin top and struggled to do my pants back up.  Walking home was not at all comfortable, more of a waddle.  Then I seriously needed to lie down and stretch out.  I don't hesitate to say that these are the best nachos I've ever had.  I just wish we had a 4th person to help us eat the monstrosity.  As for the pub; it is quite small, but with character.  Laid back staff, heavy rock playing in the background, not your usual pub music.  Would definitely go back for the nachos alone, but I might give it a while!
4 Un pub típico con una gran selección de cerveza y cider - tanto de grifo como de botella - y whiskys - por supuesto!, buena música rock/alternativa/metal de fondo.   Los camareros son muy amables y te aconsejan muy bien sobre las bebidas... te preguntan sobre tus gustos, te recomiendan algunas cervezas o ciders e igual que en la mayoría de los pubs también te dan 2 o 3 para probar y decidir tranquilamente. En este pub me sorprendieron los camareros con sus conocimientos de cada una de las bebidas que venden - Cervezas con notas sutiles de lúpulos, fondos de cítricos y con no sé qué tipos de espumas...  Con los ciders pasó lo mismo... parecía que estuviéramos en una cata de vinos en vez de un pub normal y corriente (ya me gustaría que algunos camareros de restaurantes selectos tuvieran tanta sabiduría sobre sus productos).  Igual que en otros locales hay "resident ales" de grifo que siempre son las mismas, y "guest ales" que van cambiando cada par de semanas.  La comida en The Auld Hoose es la típica comida de los bares escoceses - auténtico "pub grub", aros de cebolla, hamburguesas, cosas para picar... nachos...   LOS FAMOSOS NACHOS! Son famosos primero porque están muy buenos (con jalapeños, sour cream, carne picada, queso) y segundo porque las raciones son GIGANTESCAS!  Acabarlos es realmente misión imposible, lo tenemos comprobado - la ración para 3 a 4 personas es suficiente para 5 o 6  (bueno, o para 3 a 4 Yelpers valencianos muy hambrientos que cuando lean esto saben que me refiero a ellos :-)
4 Really GREAT local pub and dog friendly! winner! They play good music, serve proper beer and the wine is alright too. Now the food is real pub grub but the nachos... oh my word what a portion! (we ate it all though) Really oddly they didnt put any salsa on them which left me a little heartbroken but they were a treat.
4 As locals go, this one is probably hard to beat. I liked the vibe and clientele (mostly students but good craic and atmosphere) and the bar looked well stocked and plentiful.   Where this place excelled was its food. I ordered a veggie burrito and it was damn fine. Daaaaaamn fine. The plate was rammed with a massive burrito, loads of rice and sauces to boot. Hugely enjoyable pub grub.   Pals ordered a plate of nachos and they were the largest mountain of chips and topping I've seen for the price. They looked amazing!   So in short this is the place to come to catch up with pals and get fed to bursting. Yum!
5 A cosy Edinburgh pub with friendly staff, whopping nachos and a nice vibe. I like it!   I visited for a covert meeting of which I cannot reveal any of the details ... let's just say there were lots of hungry people who'd ordered two portions of nachos between 8 people before we'd arrived. I thought this was pretty optimistic when I saw the size of the nachos - these are indeed as gigantic as you've heard.   Large doesn't always mean good though (ahem) but I'm happy to report these were excellent. The tortilla chips were plentiful, obviously, there was LOADS of topping and the beef chilli was super tasty. My only suggestion would be a side plate to eat off as it was a little bit messy at times.   I wasn't drinking on this visit but their orange and lemonade is well tasty, and not too expensive either. There is parking right out the front if you're driving through from Scotland's best city for a visit, and the staff will make you feel both warm and welcome.
