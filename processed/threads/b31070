4 We have taken our jack Russell mix here twice for grooming. They are awesome!! Grooming is awesome & pricing is great !!! I recommend this little "hole in wall"!! Clean & easy to get an appointment!
4 I found a coupon from the 3 O'clock club for this groomer. I have a 4 month old Miniature Poodle and this was his first time for a grooming. He was really fluffy and although he was super cute, he didn't look like a poodle. We took him here and left him for about 3 hours and the change was dramatic. He looks like an adorable poodle instead of the fluff ball he was. I am happy with the work done, although she did say he didn't like it at all and had some difficulty but she got a close to perfect with the lininig up of his head. Looks great too me, didn't notice any imperfections. I definitely plan on going back. With my Certificate for 25 dollars that I purchased for 15.00 I only had to pay 15 dollars additional. so a great job for around a 40 dollar value. You will definitely want to call ahead and make an appointment since it seems there is only one groomer there. Very nice and cares for the pets that are brought in.
5 I went here to use their do it yourself dog wash stations and I'll be going back every month.  For just ten bucks it definitely beats trying to do it at home!  They provide all of the shampoo and conditioner, brushes and tools - and the best part is having a dryer to use.  I have a big dog that doesn't need grooming at all...just a regular bath.  Doing it at home takes forever, I end up with water and dog hair everywhere and a wet dog that takes hours to dry.   The doggy wash is a great idea that I will definitely recommend to others!
