5 I like to come on Tuesdays mornings when they first open because it's not busy and they can focus all their attention on my car.  They consistently do the BEST job cleaning my car.  I drain all my cash tipping these people. My car has never been cleaner.
2 I'm literally staring at the guys right now who are suppose to be washing my car and they are continuing to stand around and talk to each other (this has been going on for 5 mins now). The only reason I gave this place a 2 star is because the receptionist is so pleasant. Hopefully, the inside looks good.....
3 Pretty good quality for what you pay. They try to sell you everything they can think of when you get there. That's a huge pet peeve of mine.  This used to be Arizona Auto Wash I think but Francis and Sons bought it. It beats Danny's I will say that.  An interesting note, they had the Taming of The Shrew on TV inside.  Little Shakespeare shows some class.
2 They do a good job but it's like walking into a used car lot. They try to sell you EVERYTHING! Prepaid detailing - no thanks, $50 Ultimate Wash - no thanks, just a regular wash. I can give you a $5 discount if you upgrade to this one. Really annoying! I've been here about 5 times because it's close to my work and convenient to pop over during my lunch but I've had it with all the up selling! Will be looking for a new place after today.
1 This place is awful! Told the obnoxious attendant I only WANT A BASIC CARWASH 10 TIMES!!! Wanted to sell me "future" services! Pulled out and went somewhere else.
