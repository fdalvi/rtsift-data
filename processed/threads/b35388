4 I really like this Library, is big, spacious, has lots of computers available for the Avondale residents to use. There are computer "pods" near the kids/teenagers reading section, that they can use to either play games or do some research. I like it that they have a separate room where they have the toddler reading time, also, once a week, I believe, they have just Toddler playtime, which is not guided by the staff, but there is someone from the Library staff present to keep everything running smooth. Plushy toys, board books, and different puzzles are available for the little ones to play with. They also have conference rooms that you can use to study, or maybe reserve for a group meeting and such. I like the diversity of books they have available, DVDs, and CDs that you can check out. Recommend it!
5 Good place to go to get out of the summer heat. the only draw back is it looks more like a internet cafe than a library most of the time.
3 Bright - very sunny.  Good for studying if you don't mind a little noise.  Study rooms - only two, and they are often booked so make a reservation.  Free wi-fi.  Pleasant and courteous staff.
