3 Really 2 and 1/2 stars but I'm rounding it up to 3 because it's a spacious, bright and clean restaurant in a nice area, the salsa bar is a nice touch, and the food portions are relatively generous. The food I had, though, was far from memorable. I ordered the carne asada platter; the meat was dry and tasteless, as was the rice; and the guacamole side was watery. Definitely room for improvement here.
4 Filiberto's has always been one of my favorite stops. I would not say it is the most 'authentic' mexican food I have ever had, but the food here is good, very inexpensive and the portions are huge.  I can drive by this location at almost any hour and there are customers inside. If you hit them around dinner time or when the Gym Grill & Bar closes, expect a line of people.  My personal favorite is the carne asada burro with pico, sour cream and cheddar cheese. Some call it a gut bomb...I call it nirvana. Decide for yourself...
3 Been here tons of times. I've had no real problems. They have forgotten some of my sides a couple times
3 Its decent Mexican food.  A couple years ago my wife and I got bean burritos and they used way to much lard and my wife hasn't had another since.  That's the only negative and it was just one time but once is enough to turn someone off for good.  I love their red salsa at the bar but it could be hotter
2 **HAD TO EDIT REVIEW**  *FIRST REVIEW*I am finding it is hit-or-miss with this location. Although, things have been better there since the new ownership. It is definitely much cleaner than it used to be!!!  Sometimes the food is really good, and sometimes it is okay. I guess it just depends on the cooks. Sometimes the service is good, and sometimes it sucks.   Just plan on a long line in the evening on Tuesdays for $1 taco night, the chicken taco is Muy Bueno!  **EDITED - NEW REVIEW** - This place is going downhill again, FAST! Food consistency is crap. Either the chicken taco's are too spicy or very bland, or the green chile burrito is too hot or barely spicy. The dining area is getting gross and dirty again, and the staff is rude again. They also raised their prices. A bean burrito that used to be about $2.50 is now almost $4!!! For a BEAN BURRITO! I give up on this place........
2 If your expecting high quality Mexican food this place isn't it, but the food is decent. I would have given it three stars but the last time I ordered food here when I got home and opened my bag's our order was completely wrong.
5 This place used to be horrific. We'd stand there waiting to order and the order-taker guy would be having some long conversation with his friend at a table, completely ignoring us. Or he'd answer his cell phone in the middle of us telling him what we wanted to eat. It was nuts. However they recently(ish) came under new management and it's been FANTASTIC service since then. Super speedy fast, they get the order right, and they're ready and waiting for us to order the second we're in the door. We had stopped going there because it was a major ordeal just to get the guy to take our order (and then another 20 minutes for them to make us a Super Nachos) but we saw the big yellow sign out front saying "under new management" so we tried it again and...FIXED! The new owners know how to run a business.
4 The carne asada fries are great and they give you a ton of meat for just $6 you can't go wrong just add some of the fresh hot sauce from the salsa bar and your good to go.
1 Awful food. Soggy taco shells and staff are not very friendly.
5 Great late night Mexican food!!!  Quick service:)
4 Great carne asada  burritos.. They're Big enough for at least 2 meals
