3 It's a CVS. It treated us right. Got what we needed. Clean overall.
5 It's great that they text you when your script is ready! Makes life so much easier, and that alone is worth the 5 stars! It's CVS, not much more to write about!
4 I have never really been a fan of either CVS or Walgreens locations in my area, but this CVS has just turned that all around.  Honestly, I do not know how they got so much better but the first thing I noticed as a customer is that their staff actually knows what is going on and how to run a store.  They are not miserable at their jobs, and they actually have some personality.  I think this proves the case that good people make all the difference.    CVS photo-lab via the Shutterfly web site was good as well.  Prints were done quickly as promised.  Overall, very happy here.
5 My cvs! Only one i go to :) love it
