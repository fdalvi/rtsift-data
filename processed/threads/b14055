5 Subway is so great.  I try not to eat out too often, but when I don't want to feel guilty about going to Mcdonald's or Chipotle, I usually choose Subway.  This location is within walking distance from my home.  Plus, they always have these deals going on.  For the rest of June, there are three 6" subs that you can get for $2 each.  How great is that?  Those subs are the Cold Cut Trio, Meatball Marinara and the Veggie.  Yummmmm.
3 Convenient location to my hotel.  I like the healthy choices that Subway serves and their frequent deals.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Location clean and well kept.  Good choice for healthy fast food.
4 If you read my review of the Subway in downtown Phoenix, this clean, friendly, well run location is everything that the downtown location is NOT, and I mean that in the most complimentary way.  The location is clean and the staff are all friendly, clean cut and professional. I know we're talking fast food here but it's clear that the management here hold the business and it's employees to high standards.   I don't usually write reviews on fast food places but the service I get here is so good and it is such a marked contrast to what I have to endure at lunch hour downtown, that I had to give the guys on 16th street a holler and compliment them on a job consistently well done.
4 Good fast service, friendly employees. I'm a fan!
4 Clean, well-run Subway.   Limited number of seats...more suited for take-out...or "take-away" as my UK colleagues would say.
