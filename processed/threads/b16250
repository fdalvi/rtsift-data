5 Heather at this Supercuts is awesome, she always gets the blend perfect and makes sure every detail is spot on. If something is not quite right she will see it and take the time to get it right before she lets you get out of the chair.  My hair grows fast and I like to keep it short, so I come in here about twice a month.   My only complaint is that sometimes Heather goes on vacation and I have to walk around with a shaggy mop for a few days, but all is fine when she returns.  Get the tea tree treatment after your cut, it's well worth the extra $7. Your hair and scalp will feel tingly clean and it's super relaxing.
4 Friendly and efficient with convenient hours and within walking distance of my home.  Prices trend a bit higher than some of the other chain salons in the area but I've been quite pleased with my last three visits here in all but one regard - the horrendous pop-music playing far too loudly.  Never faced by more than a fifteen minute wait for a walk-in and with my bank, post office, and Smith's just down the way suffice it to say I'll be a regular here as long as I live in Las Vegas.
