5 Awesome prices, great service.  We went back after we bought some paint to see if they could make it a little darker and they did it for no charge.  Also offer 0-VOCs paint in ANY color they have for a really good price!  This was huge, b/c we're about to have a baby and I didn't want to be breathing paint fumes.
5 You know you are getting old when you are excited about finding a rad paint store!   The guys here are always super friendly and extremely helpful.   I've always been pleased with my paint purchases.   The hours kinda suck they close at 5 during the week, however they open super early. So I just called in my order in the afternoon, I needed 6 paint samples, and drove by at 645 in the morning the next day and they had them ready for me. They are open on Saturdays, but again for a limited time. That's my only gripe.   The products they sell are top notch and the color selection they have is vast.
