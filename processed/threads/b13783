3 Basically the only place around. There's a banner outside proclaiming it's under new management (for what it's worth).
4 Was a little questionable from the outside, but the food turned out to be surprisingly good.  Four of us had the chicken and beef chimichangas, chicken burrito enchilada and the carne asada plate. All were good and well priced. Will definitely stop in again if ever passing through.
3 I can't speak for the rest of the menu but the carne asada tacos at this desert joint were delicious. My daughter and I were heading on I-One-Oh from Tucson to Frisco and we stopped here because the food options decrease dramatically as we course the wide Sonoran Desert. What makes the tacos really special are the amazing corn tortillas, which are made there! The horchatas were also sweet and tasty. It's a small family run business. Not pretty to dine in but worth the visit.
5 Any place that will make a breakfast taco from scratch off the menu and be so nice about deserves a shot and the home tortillas were an awesome addition!!!
