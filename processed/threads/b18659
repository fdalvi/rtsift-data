3 This place saved me!  My belt broke on my way to Blondie's, and thank god the mall was still open when I got there.  I searched for a cheap belt, and Journey's won with a $12 belt that has been holding my pants up since.
4 I find myself here with my guy if he's looking to buy something casual. The staff is pretty friendly and helpful here. They definitely have a bigger selection compared to other Journey's ( of both apparel and shoes).   I came here to buy my guy one of his anniversary present this past Saturday. Even though they were pretty busy, the staff still found time to assist everyone in need. The same guy who we normally dealt with, helped us with our purchase and my guy couldn't be any happier. We left the place with a pair of Nike's he's always wanted to get! Yay!
4 I have a problem. Although I always say that I will stop shopping, I have yet to live up to those words. Instead I go and buy more stuff. Do I regret any of it? No, why else do I work other than to support my lavish lifestyle and my continual addiction to Yelp.   I saw a pair of boots that I was hesitating on when I went out to lunch with a friend. After a week, I was still thinking about these boots. That was a sign that I needed them. I went to another location to find out that not all Journeys are created equal. Eventually I came back here to find my shoes and a staff that was ready for me. I was in and out in 10 minutes. It was fantastic.
