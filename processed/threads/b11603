5 Signature Smiles, Doctor Suarez & Staff, Simply amazing!!
5 Dr. Suarez and his staff are the best!!  I'm am not a fan of sitting in the dentist chair by any means, but he and all the staff have always made me feel at ease and do amazing work. I've had fillings replaced, cleanings and major work as well and I couldn't be happier! My son loves them as well.
5 Dr. Suarez has been my dentist since 2001 and is the best dentist I have ever been to!! So gentle, extremely personable, has an eye for making the smallest corrections/enhancements that leave you with an incredible smile!! His staff is wonderful and Dr. Suarez is a gem! I've referred many new patients that feel the same as I do :)

5 Dr Suarez and his team are absolutely amazing! The service they provide from the phone and text reminders, to the way you are greeted at the front desk, to being in the dentist chair, you are handled with care and compassion and most importantly like family! I recommend Signature Smiles to everyone!
