5 They have everything here like your average walmart. This place is huge!  They have great deals all the time and you can often find items for less than what they're priced at other stores.   Great selection of meats and produce.  Staff is friendly and ready to assist you with all your needs.  The men's restroom is surprisingly clean compared to other supermarkets.  Decent furniture at decent prices.  I really enjoy shopping at this Fry's location.
2 I don't know why Fry's Food & Drug bothers to stay open past 10PM as they are so limited on what they can do for you after that time.  We went in to buy some laundry detergent and get a roll of quarters ( Have to wash clothes at hotel ) and acourse they didn't have any.  I guess its not that big of deal but its just frustrating especially since Winco has entered the market and is far superior even against Wal-Mart.  Fry's is lucky they are basically on every corner because once Winco builds out across the valley Fry's will be hurting.
4 Bank of America located inside. Rose, the deli manager, is fantastic and all about customer service.
4 I'd have to say this is my go to Fry' s. After living near Arcadia and the closest Fry's was 44 st and Thomas the Fry's is like walking on clouds. This location is always kept clean and stocked, staff is friendly and willing to help you, and most importantly to me there are not screaming children running around with breads sticks as swords. I would say the only down fall is the parking lot, it was not build in relation to the building and it is also small for the size and the amount of people that visit.
