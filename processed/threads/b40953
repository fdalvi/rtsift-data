4 Honestly, I hated this location and swore to never go back there after the way I was treated one day. Out of desperation and in a time crunch, I went to get my brows done quickly and met Huma.  She. Is. Amazing. My brows look perfect every time. She always remembers me and is so helpful. All of the women there are great, I've never seen the guy I had trouble with again. I'd highly recommend going to this location.
5 Love this place! Huma always takes care of me. There's never usually a long wait to get in. This is the only place I'll go for eyebrow threading.
5 Quick easy never have to wait. Place is clean and staff friendly! It's an awesome location.
1 Wow!! 20minutes till they close and the lady didn't even give me the chance to sit when she told me come back another day.. F.. Rude .. I actually wanted to give this place a chance but after today I will never step foot in this place.. Wish I could rate them less than a star
1 went there three times because it's closer to my house and each time my eyebrows looked the same as when I walked in. The girls there don't know how to thread eyebrows. Drove to Eyebrows R Us on Marks street this last time, what a difference. Will travel to that location from now on. Totally worth it. I would give this location no star rating if that was an option
