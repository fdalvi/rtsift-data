4 I typically like to go to NAPA, Carquest, or BAP for auto parts. But I have to say that this AutoZone has saved my ass more than once, for the sheer fact that it is ALWAYS open (literally, 24/7!), and it's close to my house.  I also use their website pretty often, for the repair info section, when I don't have my shop manual nearby. It even has diagrams of systems and such.
4 This Autozone is open 24hrs & close to my house. It seems like they are always running some kind of special on Motor oil & filter the main reason I shop here.
4 The customer service here does lack as you can expect to be waiting to check out for awhile.  It's very rare that you can be in and out.  However, the store is open 24 hours a day and that is the reason why I am a fan !
4 This autozone is pretty rock solid. The staff is very knowledgeable although you may have to wait awhile in line to get anything. It's also very convenient that they are open 24/7. I'm not some crazy person who is there at 3am to get anything but when me and my buddy need something for my car at 8 or 9 it's nice to go to the autozone right down the street. Only getting 4 stars due to the wait time that you may have to go through. Be careful idk about anyone else but this is a place I can definitely blow the budget.
