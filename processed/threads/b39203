5 Can't go wrong with A salon setup! and prices are $30 up to $150 Flat rate!!  I Highly Reccommend the MicroLink individuals! ( the little bead and i-tip hair method) it comes out really natural  AND: the prices include Cut and Blending woot! woot!!  the hardest method only takes 2 hours! others are just 1hour!! fast..very fast!!!  The website has lots of pictures and info!  the prices just dont include hair, you need to buy the hair you want installed. but then you know exactly what you are getting AND you can make it work with your budget =)  Grand Finale: she can even help you save money buy re-using hair if you keep it in really good condition!!
5 Microlink full installation only 2 hours and only cost $150!!  The pure Cinderella keratin: 1 hour and only $125!!  Both had complimentary iPad/ wifi and CUT & BLENDING of the  Hair Extensions
5 I am very picky. I tell her how I want my hairs extension to be install because I have very fine thin hairs:( and she produce an amazing result so here I am all the way from Los Angles CA just to get my hairs done right:) thank u Nat!! For making me Beautiful :) :) :)
