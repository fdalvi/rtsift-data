5 Love at first sip! Foodies and Beer lovers beware your wallets will empty upon arrival to Imbibe. It Awesome. The menu isn't super extensive but has some great dishes, including some vegetarian options. The service was awesome, our server had tons of knowledge as far as the menu goes and great beer knowledge i love everything i drink here. They serve local wines and craft beer only from Ontario. The server let me know they change beer almost everyday and often only buy one keg per beer.  All i want to do is come here everyday. I would live here. Imbibe is spot on. Just what downtown Kitchener needed!  I love you Imbibe.
1 Awful food. The beer selection was local, interesting craft stuff. My meal was clearly mostly prepped by a robot or possible undocumented immigrant in California, as it was machine perfect square sliced and aged to sourness. Bitter, sour salad, dry machine cut chicken on my flatbread.  Go for the selection of half a dozen craft beer, but be prepared to wait for service. And for the love of god, eat elsewhere.
5 i'm From Atlanta GA, stumbled on this little jem. Best fish tacos i've had and better caesar salad i've had in long time, got the dressing just right. HIGHLY recommend
5 Great food and local beer collection. Friendly staff! All around solid vibe. Lobster bisque soup had really big chunks of fresh lobster and cheesecake (made in house), is phenomenal.
5 Great atmosphere, delicious food. The poutine wasn't exactly traditional, but it was great nonetheless.
