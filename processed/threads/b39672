5 This barber shop is up & coming in Surprise, AZ. I really appreciate the "common courtesy" as they do their job very well. And the cost is EXCEPTIONALLY LOW for what you get groomed up for !!! Lee is very professional, as well as his clergy ! They not only have a pool table, but I hear they will soon be having a chess table as well (in which I HAVE NOT SEEN in a barber shop in the West Coast as of yet, only in the East Coast). Even Theresa, a female barber and stylist, is very good and holds her own with her skills in this shop ! I do think other barber shops in Surprise are overrated, and the waiting is extremely long as well... But not in Executive Cuts... They are on the $$$ ! Thanks again... And I will spread the word (for word of mouth is the best advertisement anyway).  !
1 My son walked into this barber shop, no one bothered to greet or acknowledge him. They looked at him after already being in there for five minutes and told him to sign in. Not welcoming, terrible customer service.
