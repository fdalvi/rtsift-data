3 The staff here are very nice. They really try to help with any financial issue one might have. I'm new to IRA's and Mortgages but they were able to answer all of my questions and gave me their personal office line for my outside lenders to contact them in case I needed help. I really appreciate the extra help, finances can be extremely overwhelming and good help and education is hard to find. I have been a customer since I started working and NSB has always been an amazing bank.
4 First time at this location. Very friendly and not very busy at all. Older building, but still very clean inside. Not as many tellers as some NSB's, but like I said "not very busy'"
1 Friendly group, but the fees they charge are out of this world.
