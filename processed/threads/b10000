2 This place is ok if you live near by.  Mostly generic brands of feed at brand name prices. So no bargains here! They claim most of their stuf is Purina off labled branding...  Besure you smell the feed, bought some rancid smelling rooster mix the other day. Also they charge extra for credit cards, which is against visa's merchant policy, so not much integrity at this place! and sometimes they charge tax on poultry feed, sometimes they put its tax exempt, so watch your receipt. They are very nice at this place, just be careful! they know what their doing...
5 I went to this place to purchase second set of puppy vaccines . The staff was very knowledgeable . Gave me step by step directions . I recommend . No goin to vet or pet store waiting in line. And to top it off I only paid 7 bucks for the complete kit ! If it's near you it's worth it .
