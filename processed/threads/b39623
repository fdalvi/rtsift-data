2 The atmosphere was nice. I ordered a Carbonara and it came out not creamy at all. It was also bland and as if they didn't add any salt.  I told the waiter that it was not creamy. He took away my pasta and added a scoop of alfredo sauce (or some kind of orange-color cream sauce)  it was super salty!  and that is not how you make carbonara!!! *facepalm* I dont think the chef knows how to cook. perhaps some cooking lessons from online blogs or even allrecipe will help. Even I can cook better carbonara at home than here.
1 Horrible. Waited roughly 1 hour after ordering for the wings to come for their 39 cent wings on a Tuesday. Wings were tasteless and bland. Never again.
