5 I wish I had done it sooner!  Had "Shelves That Slide" installed in my older kitchen cabinets.  I had noticed their ad for years and decided it was time.    Working in my kitchen is so convenient now.  Just pull a shelf forward for easy access.  Their salesman/installer came to my home & took shelf measurements.  He brought along a sample shelf so I could see what I was ordering.  A few weeks later he was back with the shelves built to order.  Installation was smooth.  He was a real pro - it took less than a couple of hours to install my 12 shelves.   This is a quality product - made of hardwood with a melamine finish on the bottom, and all metal shelf glides. A lifetime guarantee.  I am 100 percent happy!
5 One of our neighbors at Pebble Creek had "Shelves That Slide" installed in their home.  They loved them.  So, we ordered them.  Wow!  What a hell-of-adeal!  We have been here ten years and we really would have had them installed much sooner.  The sales rep/installer was clearly a pro - no problemo!
5 Ahhhhhhh-mazing!!!!!! We had sliding shelves installed in our kitchen as well as in-cabinet garbage cans.  I lost one cabinet for the trash, but still netted out 2 extra cabinets of space.  I love that with the pull of a shelf, I can see what I have at a glance.    The salesman is also your installer, so there are no "translation" issues.  I couldn't be happier and cannot wait to do our bathrooms next!
