1 I had been a patient of Arrowhead Dermatology (Peoria) for over 9 years (before they moved over to Deer Valley). I saw a variety of docs and P.A's over the course of time as a patient with them and I was never impressed. After two pregnancies, I developed Melasma (brown spots all over my face, also known as Pregnancy Mask). NONE and I mean NONE of the doctors I saw there took any time to help me fix the problem. With nearly every appointment, I'd wait 30-40 minutes PAST my appointment time, only to have the doc run in, BARELY look at my complexion, throw a Rx at me and run out. Nothing ever worked and when I'd go in for the melasma, they'd write a rx and it would cause my face to break out SO bad and I'd go back in and they wouldn't tell me it's from the Tri-luma...I did my own research and it says it can cause breakouts. They wasted my time and money for a long time and led me to believe nothing could be done with my condition. This past summer I discovered an incredible derm on literally the other side of town from where I live who helped fix my problem in 3 weeks. She did for me in 1 appointment that Arrowhead Dermatology couldn't do in 7 years!!! She cared and Arrowhead Derm did not. My face is now restored back to looking wonderful and I am so happy that I left Arrowhead Derm.   The final straw was when after consulting with the doctor who recommended I try a chemical peel...I called their office to schedule an appointment with THEIR estechian to have the expensive peel done. I was told I had to consult with her first and that would be $75 and could not be used towards the cost of the procedure. Even though I had just met with THEIR doctor who referred me. Forget that...I didn't feel like I should have to pay for the consult with a woman who cleans skin even though I had just met with their PROFESSIONAL doctor.   Their practice only cares about pushing botox and removing moles. Not one of their doctors cared enough about me to help me and it seems like all my friends and neighbors who I've talked to have very similiar stories with them. Stay clear of this practice. They are not worth your time! They are terrible!!!!!
1 I was a patient of Arrowhead Dermatology for 8+ years. I now drive nearly 1 hour across town to a FABULOUS Ahwatukee dermatologist who did more for me in 1 appointment than multiple Arrowhead Dermatology doctors could not do in 7 years.   The wait time in the waiting room is ridiculous LONG. They are NEVER on time and in fact 15-20 minutes late.   Each time I felt the doctors ran in and ran out BARELY looking at my skin or even remotely helping me with my concerns.   They wrote rx for me that caused my problems to get worst but never told me it would. I did my own research on the matter and took myself off what they prescribed.  After all of our methods were exhausted, they recommended I see one of their estecians for a chemical peel. I called to make the appointment and was told there would be a $75 consult fee. EVEN THOUGH I had just met with THEIR doctor and had been seeing their medical professional. I was told the $75 consult fee would not be used towards the cost of the $150+ chemical peel. What a joke and a waste of money. That was the final straw.  Multiple doctors cared less and knew nothing about helping me fix the melasma I had developed. No joke my new derm was amazing and put me on a whole regime and it was clearer in less than a month and is now nearly GONE. 7 years I messed around with Arrowhead Derm and they did nothing. Multiple friends and neighbors have had the same experience. I

1 Arrowhead Dermatology deserves 0 stars but I was unable to give it that rating due to Yelp's review procedures.  At all costs, avoid this place.  The doctors are on a schedule to get you in and out as quickly as possible.  Don't ask questions or it will throw them off their timing.  They  don't ask questions either for the same reason.    I scheduled 2 procedures as recommended by the doctor with a PA because the doctor was not able to perform minor surgery for more than a month.  PA was the most rude, disrespectful person I have ever met.  When I stated 2 procedures had been scheduled, she commented that I don't tell her what to do.  Refused to do both procedures and charges nearly twice what the doctor does.   Like the doctors, she stated she had a specific schedule to keep.  I was informed she did not have time to discuss my procedure and if she didn't get started right away, I would need to come back another time.  Assembly line surgery!!!   I walked out.    Zero customer service, Zero etiquette, Zero ethics, Zero common sense, Zero patient focus.  It appears to be all about making money!  Shame on Arrowhead Dermatology for treating patients so poorly.
1 Worst experience I have ever had! The doctor was rude and annoyed with my questions. When she saw a wart on my leg she acted like I was a mutant. Then I had a mole check, and I asked her about my acne. She told me I should have made 3 separate appointments!! Seriously?!! Trying to get more money?? She recommended accutane. She didn't even look at my acne or face to see if I needed that strong of a drug.  I have gone to a different derm and I am acne free and I didn't have to take accutane.   I was more knowledgable than her. No joke.   Don't ever go here!
5 I love Dr Haar.  He is very professional, knowledgable, thorough, takes time to listen and explains everything to me.  Jordan, his assistant, is an absolute doll.  They both make me comfortable, take any fear out of the procedures and follow ups.  I feel like they are my friends!
1 If I could give ZERO stars I would.  Dr. Julie Jacobs is honestly the worst doctor (and I use that term loosely) I have ever been to.  She stands and stares at you and doesn't really answer questions directly.  Honestly she acts like she doesn't even know what she is talking about when she does answer.  She did a biopsy on my daughter and dropped the scalpel and the dripped blood all over her skirt!  And prior to the biopsy she wasn't even going to test my daughter for MRSA but was just going to prescribe meds without knowing what was growing on her leg!!!  Isn't that what started MRSA in the first place?  Over prescribing antibiotics?  When we thought my daughter was having an allergic reaction to the numbing shot she just stared at us and said "that has nothing to do with this....do you have anxiety??"  I almost died!    And just to add to this she also makes you schedule an appt for every "issue"....you can't go in for acne and a skin lesion.  You need separate appts (and do pays).  They also make you come in every 3 months to write you a new prescription so they can charge you a co pay as well.  Beware!!!!!!!!!
5 Love them! I never went to a specialist before so I had no idea that the copay is 60 verse the 30 I usually pay at the doctors office. I only brought 40. I was absolutely mortified. But they were so awesome and just told me to bring the rest sometime that day. Even though they've never met me before they were so trusting and sweet. Luckily my husband was in the area so he could come by and pay the remaining. But I was so thankful! And Becky the pa that did my exam was awesome!
2 Nice doctors and, staff but watch out for hidden fees. I went in for a botox consultation and asked a question about fillers which cost me an additional $50 that I dint find out about until I checked out. I don't mind paying for services, but it's kind of like restaurants that charge for refills...tell me about it so I can decide whether my question is worth fifty bucks.
