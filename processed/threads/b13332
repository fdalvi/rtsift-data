5 Donna, you said it all!
4 This ACE has friendly service like an old "mom and pop" hardware store from a generation ago.  They're usually good with the greeting on the way in and rarely am I not asked if I need assistance with finding something.  They have more than you think in here, and it saves me a trip to Home Depot with their arcane split enter/exit doorways.  Whether it's a new set of keys, moustraps, or a garden hose, ACE is your place.  Located SE corner of 67th Ave. & 101 adjacent to the 99 cents store.
5 So, the prices are a little higher on most items in the store. The trade-off is that you can ask anyone who works here where to find something, and they will walk with you to the item's location. They'll also ask if they can help you look up some obscure part number for your sprinkler system. The girls working the registers are always friendly and helpful, too.  If you need a key made or some paint matched or something for your yard or a tool, Ace is so much more convenient and well organized than warehouse stores are and the service just wins.
