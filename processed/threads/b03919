4 I've gone to Great Clips a few times in the past, but this was my first experience in Arizona. I was willing to give them a try, especially with a coupon on hand.   I waited about 5 minutes before the stylist saw me. Upon entering, I thought the wait was going to be longer as several folks were waiting. Fortunately for me, all the stylists wrapped up their customers at the same time..  I was seated in the chair and the stylist asked how I wanted my hair cut. She promptly did what I asked. She did a great job and was very happy with my haircut. The stylist was very pleasant and had a nice conversation, but not to the point she talked my ear off.    I was in and out within about 15 to 20 minutes. I'll take that anyday!
4 Very nice people, helpful,did exactly what I needed.
5 AWESOME!  Need I say more?  Cindy is rockin'!  Great lady, great stylist and a great haircut.  The Great Clips iPhone app is excellent and very easy to use plus it tells you about how long the wait is before you even get there.  I'm a bleiever!  thank you Cindy!
1 Went in to get it cut, as I was waiting for 20 minutes at least 6 people who must of "checked in" got their hair cut before me. After waiting 40 minutes, I left and went down the street to this new place called best cuts off of Broadway. They was no wait and I left with the best haircut I've had in a long time and it was only $2 more!! Needless to say, this is my new place and should be yours.
4 I came in on July 3rd, 2014 in the afternoon. I was in kind of a hurry and needed a moderately complex haircut. I was called in by Gayle I believe. that was the name on the receipt she was the Asian American women. I was not being particularly pleasant at the time and she was very patient with me.  Definitely would not mind getting my hair cut from her again. Even ended up getting a more than decent haircut in the process even though we had a minor tiff in the beginning. Glad that this great clips has some good stylists in its employ.
