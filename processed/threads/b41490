5 Had a wonderful experience working with Myra. Came across her website online and was looking for a home in my price range in the queen, creek, AZ area. Myra worked really hard to find my family the perfect affordable home. She kept in constant contact and had professional communication skills. It was an absolute pleasure working with Myra and I highly recommend her!
5 Myra is a one of the better Real Estate sales people in this area. Her thorough knowledge of properties, the area, including finding great pricing on remodeling supplies is tremendous. Her honesty is unparalleled and her keen insight into saving money and time are much appreciated. Will do business again.
5 If you are looking for an individual who has knowledge about the Real Estate market - look no further.  Myra is a consummate professional who looks out for her clients best interests whether it is in purchasing or buying a home, or assisting in finding that right person to rent your income producing property. I wouldn't trust my business with anyone else but Myra!  I will do business with her again.
