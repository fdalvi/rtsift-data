5 Killer smoke shop right beside my house! Everytime I go it's always busy, probably because the prices are low.  They just started adding a vaping section to the store so all the vape heads can get their fix too. And one of the main reasons I go as well.   Nice selection of glass, hookahs, and various niknacks. Check it out if you get a chance, owners are user friendly.
5 Very large glass selection and vape section. The e-liquids are very good and  relatively cheap price. The owners always seem to  offer us a great price on all their products. I would efinitely recommend this place.
