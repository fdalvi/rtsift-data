1 Maybe the blandest and most unappetizing Mom and Pop Chinese restaurant I've ever eaten at.  I had the displeasure of trying this place once during lunch for work, and once for dinner before a Suns game. Both times they offered cheap combination platters that ran about 7 dollars for an entree, soup, fried rice, and egg roll. Everything from there I would probably rank a step or two below what you even get at a Panda Express.  The Ma po tofu dish I picked last time for dinner was particularly awful and bland. Some cheap store bought tofu lightly fried with some soy sauce. If it wasn't enough, I got somewhat sick off of it too. How do you poison someone with a tofu dish? I guess this place is good at sucking every way possible.  At least its cheap.
2 Holy crap this food is bad.   I'll not give it one star because the people are friendly, the menu is inexpensive, and they serve combonation plates during dinner times. Most of the time it is hard for me to get Chinese because everything is a la carte after lunchtime, and when you are dining alone, that sucks.   They close at 8PM nightly, and don't have much foot traffic after about 4pm. The food sucks and it seems like everyone knows it.
3 The place isn't have bad.  I got a sweet and sour lunch combo, and it came out fine.  Their menus pretty thurough, and prices are really fair.  Its chinese food, and if your in the area, it should get you where you need to go.  Place is clean, staff is friendly.  Would return for lunch here again soon.
