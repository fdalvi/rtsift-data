1 Horrible service the guy there was not helpful, I asked simple questions, and he walked away refusing help. I will not be returning. Do not come here ever.
1 Crappiest service ever! If they is even a remote chance you may return something go somewhere else or look at every bit of fine print on your receipt. Never shopping at a Radio Shack again!
4 I had no problems with this location.  The young man who helped me, Allen, went and got the products I asked for, described them to me with knowledge, and showed me the choices I had.  I bought two products and would have gotten three except they were out of one.  I think I've been coming here since 2007 off and on and I'm sure my father came here for years also. I'll be back next time I need what they carry.
1 For starters, the employee was busy on his own personal phone and then decided to help me while he was still on a personal call, on his own cellphone. Really, that happen.   I just needed to return a powerbank that failed. I was doing it before the 30 day policy. Didn't need a refund, just replacement.   Long story short, I wanted to replace my powerbank. My options were stupid. Option 1. Let the employee trade it out for one in his inventory and he will  put it as "defective"  but I don't get receipt so I'm screwed if this one fails as well. Or option 2.  I can pay 3 or 4 dollars for him to do an ACTUAL return in the system. In doing so I would have a receipt but would have to pay the difference because the taxes between Chandler and Gilbert (where it was purchased) are different.    The employee said " I'm trying to just do the easy way for ya"      More like for him. No wonder he works at RadioShack.
