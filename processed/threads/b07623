5 Union Hills Ace Hardware is really great.. the staff is knowledgeable and if by chance they dont have an item they will help you by calling another Ace and checking for you.
1 Not sure who I spoke with, some supposed  manager.  All I needed was to get a pipe cut for a ceiling fan.  This person said they only cut and thread pipe they sell.  Fair enough,  I kindly offered to pay for the service.  All I got was a repeat of what he initially said.  I will now drive to Home Depot every time I need something even though this store is a half mile from my new home.  Great way to lose a brand new homeowner with many needs in the future!
4 For a local, smaller hardware store they really pack the merchandise in!  Always someone to wait on you and really helpful too.  There is a pretty large assortment of stuff you never knew you needed!  While smaller than a huge mega warehouse I always enjoy going here because of the excellent service and really competitive pricing.  AND it's a quick drive down the street!
4 Normally I would give 3 stars for these typical chain conglomerates. The negative side of Ace Hardware is they are a little pricey, the upside is that they are super friendly and eager to help you find what you need quickly. Since I'm from Wisconsin and I know the value of a good root beer I was pleasantly surprised to find my favorite brand here. Sprecher root beer & other flavors all the way from Wisconsin! Of course I'm going to have to bump the star rating up a notch on this one folks!
