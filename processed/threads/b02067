1 I ended up paying 1k for a crown that they said would be covered by my insurance. Then they billed me $50 for not going back to them.
5 My family and I have been seeing  Dr. Bazilus (Dr. B) for a few years now. He is a great denist and recommend him to all my family and friends. His office manager Deborah is very helpful and sincere.
5 I am a patient of Dr. Bazilus', and he is the absolute best!  Dr. B is always very honest and makes me feel so comfortable when I come for my appointments.  I've had a few cavities filled and also did the Venus whitening last year.  The front office staff is so friendly and Megan always greets me with a smile and makes me laugh!  I feel so welcome there and never am afraid to go to the dentist anymore.
5 I recently came here for the first time and loved it! The staff at the front were so kind and helpful. I only had to wait a few minutes and then I was taken back into the dental rooms. Everything was very modern and clean. I felt really comfortable here, and I really think it was because everyone seemed to like working there. My hygienist Brigitte was sweet and patient. She also gave me a good cleaning with the cavitron and regular instruments. Dr. Mayer was my dentist and he was nice and answered all of my questions thoroughly. I felt like he really listened to me and cares about my teeth. I will definitely stay with this dentist and am so happy I came here.
1 This practice sends out junk mail and there is no way  to get off.  From now on I am going to write a negative review about everyone who sends me junk mail
