1 This one rounds out my selection of pizza shops in Laveen.  They all get one star, although I think I will now go back and modify my rating of Duner's, which is the only locally owned place for za nearby, to reflect that it's at least better than Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Little Ceasar's.  The only redeeming quality about Domino's is the ease of ordering and delivery.  Thank goodness I won't have to change out of my snuggy to get pizza at home!
4 Honestly, I used to HATE Dominos. Their pizza used to be complete and utter crap. Then they went through that little revamping stage (you remember the commercials) and good lord, they've turned themselves around. The pizza is not my favorite delivery pizza in the valley.   They've begun using good quality ingredients, and my favorite part; the crust is brushed wityh butter and has garlic and spices sprinkled over. I adore Dominos now, they've won me over after a long hiatus of hating them by finally producing a superb pizza.
3 Don't get the wings. They are gross. Pizza is pretty good as well as the chicken pasta. Delivery is fast.
4 Domino's has improved dramatically over the past couple of years.  The Handmade pan pizza is really at or near the top of the pizza chain pyramid.  I agree the wings need some work, but the stuffed cheezy bread is a great side.
4 Their hand tossed pizza is out of this world.  I love it but unless you get double on the toppings they're too sparce.  This time I had double on the tomato.  I was very surprised that they used a roma tomato and was very happy.  I'd order again without hesitation.
