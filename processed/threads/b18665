5 I wanted to let you all know,especially all the ladies that Ivan of Ivan's Chop Shop is a great hair stylist.  His haircuts are great, and he is a color genius.  His prices are also very reasonable. He is a perfectionist and artist at what he does.  Try him out and let him know that Belinda sent you. :)  You will not regret it.
5 We have visited Ivan for years now.  He does a brilliant job on color and such great haircuts.  He is really remarkable and has so much passion for hair!  Myself and my 2 daughters go to him.  See you soon Ivan!
5 I just had my haircut by Ivan, whom I'd lost contact with after he switched shops. He's the best stylist I've been to in Las Vegas, and I've been to quite a few! Highly recommended.
