1 Why am I seduced by fast food sometimes? Is it because I work in a full service restaurant and can eat wonderful food anytime I want? Or because I crave something processed that's laden in grease and riddled with sodium? Or is it because my bf texts me and says hey, pick up arby's? I order the number five for bf and see a delicious looking sandwich staring at me. I mean what a photo! Who took this photo? Annie Leibovitz? It's perfect looking. Turkey and Swiss on some fresh looking bread with plump tomatoes and crisp lettuce. How bad can it be? Well. Hmmm. So bad. You spit it out in a napkin and scrape your tongue with a pumice stone. Gargle with Listerine and vow to the heavens to limit your fast food to In N Out and the Philadelphia Sandwich Company. Arby's Shmarby's. Gross.
4 I have no idea what the Hell that stuff is that they try to pass off as "roast beef" ... but Damn I LOVE that crap!  Yummy.  But seriously ... what the Hell is that meat mulch?
2 It had been a lot of years and I was thinking, you know, some questionable cow and fake horseradish sauce might just hit the spot.  Their signature roast beef sandwitch comes in 3 sizes: small, medium, and something approaching the size of your head.   I think my meal had enough salt in it to pay a Roman legion with, but since the legions today are paid in Federal Reserve fiat greenbacks, the salt goes to Arby's. Maybe I'll try it again after I time travel into the future a few years.
