5 I've been to this location twice.  This is the only Prada store in AZ.  The service here is great.  Super friendly and helpful.  I was offered a beverage like many upscale stores do.  It's nothing major, but just nice that they want to make you comfortable while in their store.  This last time I went in, I was looking for something specific.  Even though they did not have it at this location, they were able to find it for me and have it shipped to my home(the color I was looking for is not available online).
5 Prada is great in customer service and this location serves up some great customer service both in person and over the phone It has a good men's selection but I know that it could be a little bigger Sizes can be a little issue but the staff will surely help you find something and have it delivered to your house or into the store So that is no biggie at all Anna provides great customer service and she is so friendly I will continue to go back
5 The staff here is so friendly and helpful. Unlike some upscale stores where they look at you, deem you unworthy and ignore  you, at Prada they wait on the sidelines with smiles and a helpful attitude.   And the quality of Prada bags goes without question. Though I didn't buy anything this time, I still love this store.
