5 I love this place.  My son loves to play at Jump & Shout.    First of all, it's so cold in there, which is lovely for summer!  Secondly, a lot of the parents wore socks as well as their kids and went up into the tunnels with their children.  I loved that if you wanted to you could be an active participant, or you can sit anywhere and watch your kids, or you can sit in the cafe, which is in a separated a bit from the play area.    I brought a book and read for a while, which was a lovely break.  I'm thinking about getting a monthly membership because it's such a great place to spend an hour or so a few times a week.  WONDERFUL!
3 was my 4 year olds favorite place, but closed suddenly just before spring break 2011.  Owner does not seem to be offering any communication at all - facebook posts have mostly been deleted, voicemail box is full, sign on door just says closed permanently.    I am sure they are dissappointd to be closed but a little more communication would be nice - especially to those people that had memberships (ours was good through the end of June) or others who had parties planned (and paid for!)
