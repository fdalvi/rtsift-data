3 Went into Office Depot for the advertised special they were having on blank CD-R's and I was quite pleased with the experience.  Place was easy to navigate and shop. Checkout was fast and curious Prices were nice and low :)
4 To be honest, the only reason this place is getting four stars is because Yelp says that I am a fan... which I am since I really do not know where else to go to pick up office/school supplies other then Office Max (to far down the street) or Walmart (Which I avoid like the plague at all hours of the day or night unless I am feeling adventourous)  Anyway, I have been going to this store for years and they have served me well with just about everything I need. Other then that though, its your average office supply store.
3 There are not that many Office supplies stores anymore, so you kind of have to give them at least 3 stars, just for sticking out the recession
3 We found a chair on there web site for a great price, well it wasn't the price in the store, but they did match it.
