4 1 word. PIE!!!!  they have really good pies here, traditional, and some not so traditional...but still really good.   food is ok. nothing that will blow your socks off. i find it better in my freezer section then in the restaurant. pot pie is pretty good too
2 As Arik mentioned in his review, this place can make some good pies. If you're looking to pick up a pie or grab some dessert, this spot can be a good option.  As far as dining here for lunch or dinner, it's nuthin special. American cuisine with no real surprises. They have an ok salad bar & can have some good soups (cheesy potato!) on hand, depending on what they made that particular day.  They have just about zero vegetarian entree options on the menu. If you're a veg head dragged along to this place for a meal, you'll probably have to custom order some pasta with veggies or get creative in another manner. I'll be trying my best to avoid the place for meals, but meat-eaters might find something enjoyable...
3 Here's Marie Callender's all-you-can-eat Soup & Salad Bar Buffet.  Now they charge 10.49 for it, which is too much, so what you want to do is order a sandwich or light entrée & add the buffet for only $2.99 more.  I got together with Norm R. today to give this place a try.  They had three soups out, & I tried the chicken breast & vegetable soup, & the Potato & Cheese Soup.  The chicken soup was especially good.  For the entree, I ordered a Cuban Sandwich, of course.  (¡Yo soy media Cubano!)  It was served on a very fresh bread roll, with thin-sliced ham & pork stacked on, topped with swiss cheese, mustard & pickle slices, & the whole thing pressed down to where you could get your mouth around it.  It was good!  Cuban Sandwich & fries $7.99 + Soup & Salad Bar $2.99=$10.98
4 Hooray for cozy, homey family restaurants with good comfort food. I like the relaxing family atmosphere, the friendly staff, and the menu that makes choosing your orders both easy (very well illustrated) and difficult (too many tempting items to choose from). Rand H. and I met here today for lunch. I ordered the pork loin and it was delicious - nicely seared, with savory mushroom sauce with crumbled gorgonzola and a hint of burgundy wine, all on a bed of piping-hot mashed potatoes. The side of steamed veggies and the hot cornbread complemented the dish perfectly. The pies were extremely tempting but after the filling meal, those are something to look forward to for my next visit(s).
