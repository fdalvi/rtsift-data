1 Um...if you think Vista is bad, try 922 Place.   Where to even begin. I'll keep things simple and brief.   For $100 less that the monthly rent at Vista (which costs and arm and a leg as well) you get: 1. A free underage hungover girl sleeping on your mattress in the middle of the living room when you walk into your apartment for the first time 2. A broken bed frame that you have to get the student workers to replace 3. Plaster everywhere 4. Sticky and gouged floors 5. A weird musty smell? And cigarette ash everywhere.  6. Beer salt all over the counter 7. Random clothing everywhere 8. Dust bunnies to put petting zoos to shame 9. Roommates who may or may not have mental issues/parents who pay for their immaturity  10. Liquor bottles EVERYWHERE 11. Dirty fridge so I can't even use it until I get it professionally cleaned unless I want to eat E. coli for lunch 12. No wifi or electric. You have to get those yourself.   That's just a couple of the issues right off the bat.   I will take a video of the current situation and post it if management doesn't get back to me on the laundry list of work repairs pending that I submitted to them this morning. If anyone else has had this experience, feel free to do the same I will do.
1 This place is worse than hell. First off, when I moved in, it was dirty and damaged. It took an entire year for the "maintenance" crew to come fix everything. The bookkeeper is ignorant and will try to weasel any dollar she can out of you because the occupancy rate is so low. The location is convenient but that is the only compliment I have to give this place. Drunken freshman roam the halls and people have no consideration for the residents. I've never been so disgusted with  a complex and management in my life. I highly recommend that you do not live here. Save yourself.
