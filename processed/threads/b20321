1 With 4 staff on it still took ten minutes to prepare a bacon roll at breakfast time, £1.75 for soft drinks struck me as expensive and I was short changed by £2. All in all not a good experience.
3 Came here with a group of friends after getting off the night coach from London. They took a while to open up and let us in but the cashier lady was nice. Ordered a salmon sandwich which came with greens and tried a ham sandwich from my friend. Sandwiches were nicely sized but there wasn't anything that really stood out. We really wanted to try a scone but since they just opened scones wouldn't be available until later.   Three starts because there wasn't anything that really stood out to me and the servers that were setting up weren't very friendly towards us and we felt pretty unwelcomed. But, did find their giant teacup pots amusing.
2 We stopped by the Deacon's House for some breakfast (and to get out of the rain).  The two of us went for the standard breakfast which was mediocre.  Its hard to screw up some eggs and bacon and sausage but they gave it a good go!  The eggs were scrambled but seemed like they were sat in a puddle of water!  The food was edible, but only just.  I don't know what it is but it was hard to find a decent breakfast in Edinburgh!  I did however like the coffee and also the cafe itself, which used to be the workshop of the Deacon (who's real name I have forgotten) and the story behind this guy.  Although a respected cabinetmaker, he was also a thief and he and his friend and co-crook were hanged on gallows that the cabinetmaker built!  I'll bet the guy wished he didn't do such a great job on them!
4 Great!
