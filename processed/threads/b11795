4 I gotta admit, I love Taco Bell! Remember how everyone loved Pizza Hut when you were a kid? Well, I liked Pizza Hut, but preferred Taco Bell. I know, weird right?  Back in the day, they used to have the Taco Bell Grande, which was a bigger version of the Taco Supreme. I loved it! I think I like Taco Bell because their food is simple, tasty and cheap. Here are my favorites:  -Taco Supreme -Chicken Supreme Chalupa -Nachos -Mango Frutista (They are oh so addicting!)  I have never dined here, but the drive-thru is always fast and friendly. They have screwed up my order a few times, but I guess you sort of expect that from any fast food place. Now that the weather is starting to heat up, I'll be back often for those Frutistas!
2 First of all, I am not much of a Taco Bell person. The only things they have that I like are their Doritos Taco and the Mexican Pizza. That's the only reason I would give them two stars.  What I came here for was to try the Cantina Bowl. I decided on steak and anticipating it to be good. NOT! It is basically a knockoff of Chipotle's steak burrito bowl! The steak itself was flavorless and it had the pre cooked taste to it, meaning all they had to do was heat it up. There was rice, beans, lettuce, and some kind of chipotle sauce (kind of ironic since it was a ghetto imitation). Immediately after this review I am going to contact Taco Bell to tell them to either make it better or quit making it and just stick to making the Doritos Taco. If they take the Doritos Taco away, then that will just erase another star on this review.  Service was ok and the cleanliness of the place was decent as well.   So if you are reading this and are thinking about getting the Cantina Bowl, DO NOT GET IT unless you want to ruin your apetite! I had to go to Chipotle that night for dinner just to satisfy my steak bowl craving!
1 Service sucks. They are always messing up orders and are rude to customers. One of their workers was just yelling at a kid for bringing in his skateboard and told him to have consideration. So rude and unprofessional.
5 I got here quite a few times each week on my way to work, its never super busy.  My order is always right and it some of the best drive thru customer service I have ever had.  Will continue to come here.
