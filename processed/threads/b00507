5 Very convenient and close by when cooking just isn't going to happen. Love the tacos and grilled sandwiches. There loyalty card is the bomb. Something free for joining and something free for your birthday. The service is awesome most of the time.
3 Sign up for the card, you get something free when you do. Okay that's all I have to say about a Jack in the Crack restaurant.
2 Jack?! What the heck? You weren't on your A-game last night.  I hastily ordered seasoned, curly fries and 3 egg rolls yesterday evening after a rough day at work. Okay, and a cheeseburger. And, Sprite. I had a bad day - don't judge!  I arrived home in Fountain Hills and tore open my grease-splattered, hot bag of treats. My eggrolls were not in the bag but yet I was charged. Grrr - hate when that happens. Drive-thru lady was friendly but needs to double check bag orders to not piss off drive-thru patrons.  Plus my fries tasted like they were sitting in the warmer for awhile. Dry and crunchy. Don't be lazy staff - dump and start again. Please! :)
