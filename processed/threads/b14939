5 Pretty standard Subway, clean and reasonably efficient staff. What sets this one apart from about ten other ones I've eaten from Surprise all the way through to this area is that they opted to stock the veggie patties. NONE of the other Subways I've tried have these. Which opens up two new items on their menu - the Veggie Patty sub and the Veggie Max salad. I just posted a pic of the latter. I'm quite a fan of the veggie patties, although they're apparently fairly high in sodium. The veggie max salad is just the right size to take the edge off your hunger at lunch and see you through to a 3pm linner. Not many people know about the veggie patty, often the person behind me will look at my sandwich being made and ask me "what sort of meat is that?" *8-)  Since I'm not a vegetarian, one day I might try the veggie patty with a coupla slices of meat like ham maybe. Might taste pretty good, especially with the spicy buffalo sauce. Anyway. Five stars.
2 As far as the sandwiches go, the place is fine but just thought I'd mention that if you are trying the broccoli-cheddar soup late in the day you may find it "overcooked tasting" bordering on acrid and burnt like we did.  I guess they assume everyone is going to order a $5 footlong because pricing for six-inchers is not quickly established by looking at the overhead menu.  Meatball Sub Note: $2 six-inchers and $4 footlongs seem to be offered here all the time.
4 Had foot long ham on wheat.  Sub tasted really fresh and was really good   Service was prompt and courteous.  Nice experience.
4 Great customer service and a quick in and out.  Ordered 2 foot longs to-go and was out the door after 5 minutes. Store was clean and I based the visit off yelp which was a good choice.
