5 Awesome food, big portions, cheap price. Its pretty decent looking in there and its clean. Only negative thing is parking is somewhat complicated. Mhmmm steak breakfast burritos :)
1 Avoid this place! I had some beef tacos and they have to be the WORST I've ever had in my life! I have never seen taco meat like this? It looked like they first boiled a steak and then chopped it with a claw hammer and seasoned it only with black pepper. My wife had the steak buritto and encountered the same lousy beef.   I went to this place because I was nearby and a yelper had given it 5 stars?!? I can't even imagine how drunk this person must have been to give it 5 stars.   Did I already say? Avoid this place!!
5 Great food very clean price r righ exelent services i'am back again good steak love it
4 They make a good Steak Burrito at moderate prices. The guy behind the counter was really nice too.
4 I work down the street from el steak burrito, so for lunch I alwayse order from here. Food is actually pretty good here believe it or not. I'm not a fan of the steak burrito,  but all my coworkers rave about it, I prefer there chicken burrito instead. I love how they make there burrito here with rice, beans, pico degallo, and cilantro. Every time I order I usually request for extra cilantro and less on the rice and it comes out perfect.       There papusa is good here also, I like the cheese filling but the other variety are good as well. Make sure you order 2 atleast cause the portion is small, I could probably eat 5 of the papusa alone but I wont lolz, it's hella greasy. The only complaint I have here is the location, horrible parking especially during afternoon. But if you work in this area, el steak burrito is worth the visit. Good food and good service.
4 Not bad for Las Vegas, Coming from the bay area, its going to be a tough review but holds its own for a mexican joint. The prices are amazing and the burrito holds its own.
4 Great steak burrito. Friendly service. Like a cross between fast food and traditional sit down. A little warm inside (A/C could be better). Great salsa! Delicious lunch spot :)
