5 I chose this shop from a handful provided by the insurance agency handling my claim; I was concerned that the chrome accents on my (relatively new) truck would not be replaced correctly by just any shop.  These guys gave me a fair estimate, and called regularly with updates about the work.  It turned out that the entire side panel of my truck had to be replaced due to the damage from the collision, but even with this work, they still had my truck ready for me three days before their estimated finish date.  The chrome and the fender all fit perfectly, and the new side of my truck is indistinguishable from the original (other than the glossy coat on the paint).  I am incredibly grateful that they took such great care of my vehicle.
