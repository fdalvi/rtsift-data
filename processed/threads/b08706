1 Worst experience I've ever had. The older woman with black hair  who either owns or works at this establishment was extremely rude and condescending to us when we were trying to view her gallery. Not even a hello upon entering the gallery, and to top it off she slammed the door and called us names upon leaving because we took one pic without knowing it wasn't allowed, can't believe this was how we were treated. I recommend not visiting this establishment. Viewing art should be a positive experience I wouldn't want to buy art work from such a negative rude person behind the creations!!! Look at other galleries on marshall way everyone else was extremely friendly! Don't visit udinotti gallery
4 Really interesting spot with a four room space featuring the works of many local artists.  Friendly staff and a truly rustic feel not nearly as scrubbed or sterile as other galleries in the area.  While I personally would have preferred actual prices on the works as opposed to a number requiring me to request more information from the staff this is a small quibble as the prices were actually rather reasonable for the quality of the worksmanship.
