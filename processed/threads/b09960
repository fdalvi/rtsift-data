4 Nice little drive-up in Boulder City. In business 12 years. Sources beans from a great roaster in WA. Delicious americano!
5 I am a former barista so I am very picky about my coffee. Nothing can touch this place - the love, care, flavor, and aroma is in every sip. Best coffee I've ever tasted in my life. On only our second visit not only were we remembered, but so was our drink order! The effort is in every sip!  The prices were a pleasant surprise and they even had soy milk!!
5 awesome! great owners and great coffee!!!
