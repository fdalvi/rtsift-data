5 Great service and food!!! Been a customer for years...  Chicken Parmesan sub... And there pizza sub are so yummy!!! always Fresh ingredients...
5 First time here. Food is fresh. Place is clean. Great customer service. Got the number 1 and my gf got the number 7. We love it. We'll be back for sure.
5 Hands down this is among the best sub shops anywhere. All the food is great but I am partial to the Sicilian pizza. The owners and folks that work here are all super nice.
