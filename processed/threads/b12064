3 Downtown Madison is undergoing a bit of a revamp as of late.  New luxury condos are popping up all over the place and once dives are bought up and turned into swanky bistros.  Cocoliquot is one of those places.     Located on the first floor of a new condo building, Cocoliquot serves admittedly tasty french cuisine and cocktails (pleasantly surprised by my peach manhattan) in a fashionably dark decor.  However, I can't jump on board with this type of dining.  Dainty plates of cheese and handmade chocolates, while nice, aren't exactly what I'm looking for a Friday night.    But neither is $500K condo.
5 Hooray for another place in Madison that satisfies my love of French cuisine!!  I ate at Cocoliquot with a group of 6 friends.  It was perfect for us!  We each ordered a couple of the "little plate" dishes and passed them around.  Basically this amounted to us trying almost everything on the menu.  The whole philosophy of the restaurant is small, appetizer-sized plates, which I like because you can try so many things!  Prices range from $4 for a tiny cheese platter to $12 for foie gras.  Even though I don't feel like I ate a lot, I was definitely filled up...that's the beauty of French food.  I'd recommend the chevre (I'm obsessed) and the mussels.  It was about $20 per person including tip for two items and a dessert per person.  I would recommend this for a large group of people or a romantic date where you don't mind using your fingers or feeding each other!  5 Stars.
3 I very much enjoyed the modern interior but was slightly let down by the food.  I thought that it didn't quite match the presentation (which was excellent).  I could have just been the dish that I ordered that night, so I'm going to have to try it again.
4 People, people...  If you want french cuisine, go to Nadias (or, gulp, L'etoile - even if L'etoile and I have a hate-love-hate relationship that inhibits me from even writing the review).  If you want DELECTABLE desserts, full of sugary goodness that makes you thank the Flying Spaghetti Monster (or whatever your Deity may be ;) for Chocolate then THIS is the place.   Hell, this is the one place I'm VERY content in letting the Chef decide for me (I once dumped a guy for trying to order, what am I, 5 in the 1950's?), and I contently tell him "Give me the Tasting Delight".  I swear EVERY TIME 'dang, I should just order this for me', after saying to the table 'Oh don't worry, we can share".  And everytime at the end, I"m glad because for some odd reason, 5 sushi like desserts are a TON, and easily eaten by 3 people.  But, in the grand tradition of french cuisine, the FLAVOUR is so bright and bursting, you only need one tiny bite to feel COMPLETELY satisfied with the taste and the texture and the flavour of the dessert.  And the chocolates.... WOOOOOOOAAAH the chocolates....   Passion fruit vainilla...... Chocolate Cardamon... Hazelnut... Macademia Nut... Pine nut.. (Ok, that's Christopher Guest's Best In Show channeling)... One tiny bite is SERIOUSLY orgasmic.    I highly recommend going to dinner somewhere else, and going here for desserts.  Because frankly, everything "washed down" with a Ma vie en Rose (Pink Wine, Orange Liquor and Bubbly) makes you feel as giddy and happy as the first time you strolled down the Champs Elysees watching the Eiffel Tower....  THE ONE COMPLAINT I WILL HAVE (YES I'm SCREAMING) is their !@#$#@#!#@#@$ no Saturday brunch, but Sunday brunch.  COME ON.. Saturday is also a day that people need food.  ESPECIALLY now in the summer, after a long arduous walk around the Farmer's market.  DO YOU KNOW how much pushing I had to do so to evade the masses of strollers in the square????!!!!   *****  UPDATE  ******* If you go just before the kitchen closes (at 10:00pm) and order a plate of fries (Super Moe tradition) they will hook you up and give you a bucket's worth.  I'm serious.  However, their fries are not the salty goodness that I expect from this food category.  I mean, they were hot, the aioli served was pretty good, but frankly, I'd rather the fries at McD's.... Again, reaching the conclusion that Cocoliquot is THE dessert place... Nothing else... ******* END OF UPDATE********
3 This is a French wannabe restaurant, but oh well, it tries hard. It's like if an ordinary Peter changed his name to "Pierre," put on a berret, but forgot to fake the French accent.  If this review sounds snobby, it's because I've been spoiled by bona fide New Orleans restaurants for years.   Let me start with the good, first though: The banana chocolate dessert bursted with flavor, and their cinnamon donuts were to die for. To give the restaurant credit, they also had a lovely, fresh chive cream cheese you can tell they made from scratch on the premises. But the waitress looked at my aunt like she had just asked to "peel her a grape" when she asked the bagels be cut into quarter sized pieces. Ha ha ha.  When I ordered a Croque Monssieur, it came with a white sauce that it "said" was bechamel, but come on: it's supposed to be more off-white and not be so bland.  My aunt made fun of the fact it was not on a french sort of toast but on white bread. Tacky. Perhaps Wonder? ;) Le sigh. Can you really be ALL that discerning about Parisian cuisine when you are in the land of beer and brats?
4 I haven't been here for dinner yet (I'm still working on that) but I have been here for brunch twice.    The first time we sat outside on the patio.  It was nice and relaxing but a little too windy (we had to hold our mimosas (yum) tightly on the table for fear they would go flying into our neighboring table - next time I'll bring my crazy glue).  We had the asparagus frittata with Gruyere cheese with a salad and cinnamon donut as a side, the Croquet Monsieur (ham & cheese sandwich with egg) with salad and a side of their Bacon Bread Pudding.  All very yummy.  They serve small portions which is great (for me) but if you're looking for a hefty brunch this is not the place to go.    The second time we came for brunch we sat inside by the window and had the Poached Eggs Smoked Trout Casserole and the Pan Perdu (french toast) with rhubarb, orange & creme fraiche compote with a side of the Bacon Bread Pudding.  All very good, but I didn't finish the bread pudding since I already had my fill of the french toast.  I wish they would have had a choice of fruit on their "sides" menu.    On to the chocolate: like little pieces of beautiful art served and displayed on a cool slab of marble.  Fresh and delicious!
3 CocoLiquot has closed.  Per the CocoLiquot web site (http://www.cocoliquot.com/), their space will be taken over by Restaurant Muramoto. Happily, their chocolatier is opening his own chocolate shop, David Bacco Chocolats, in Hilldale Shopping Center in May 2008.
