1 Do you wish that you could give no stars to review a place? I think this is the first time I have written a review for a retailer and unfortunately its not going to be pretty. Where in the hell are all of the employees? Seriously, where are they? Did I happen to come in on the day they got the cool new video game delivered and all of them were in the backroom playing it? I literally could have walked out with arm loads of merchandise without notice....several times. There was one....ONE.....employee working at one register.  After I spent what felt like an eternity finding the one item I came in to buy (again, no one on the floor to help me) I arrived at her counter.   "PHONE NUMBER?" she demanded loudly and with authority but did not make eye contact. I didn't even know she was talking to me so I said "what? are you talking to me?" She responded with "YES, PHONE NUMBER?" I had it with this place and so I said "No, you do not demand customers phone numbers when they arrive at your counter. You need to be pleasant and ask them if they found everything ok which, by the way, I DID NOT because you have ZERO employees out on the sales floor. Now lets start over shall we? Hi, how are you today?"  This did not go over well at all. She told me her manager had instructed her to ask customers this question first. So apparently the manager is an idiot. Whatever. I paid and left and won't go back.
1 Worst business ever award. They never answer the phone. Their.customer service is terrible. The store is disorganized and looks like black Friday is everyday. Go somewhere else if you can.
5 I had such a great experience at this location yesterday! I went in to get a Nabi tablet or a leappad2  for my son. I wanted some hands on usage before I spent so much. They did not have the Nabi, but the clerk (Merissa) spent a lot of time explaining what they did have, comparing different kid-friendly tablets and when they would be available. She was busy in the electronics department and had others with questions waiting, and she did a good job of juggling all of our needs. She went the extra mile and actually found the tablet I finally chose altho she did not think it would be available for several days.  I was also helped by another friendly employee, who located a hard-to-find item for me but I did not get his name. I will visit this store more often because of these encounters.
3 This place just feels really cluttered to me compared to other TRUs.  With that said, We've always been able to find what we want here.  The staff is generally friendly.
4 Toys R Us is helluva expensive compared to other stores but you know what when you want that super cool toy for your child Toys R Us is the place to go.  I have no complaints I mean my son today bought a super sized power ranger like as tall as a toddler that is way cool.  If you ever want cool toys Toys R Us is the place to go.
2 When i was a kid toys r us were nice!! This is a dumb!!!!!! Gross old dumb!!
2 I went in here for the first time in around 12 years. It was ugly and cluttered and not well lit. I am also thoroughly disappointed that they do not do any discounts or donations for nonprofit organizations that are centered around kids.
1 Employees are rude, store is a mess, no one knows where anything is even when it says they have 30 in stock. Worst run store i have ever been too. Demeanor on the phone is also horrible. Calling corporate is also worthless because they will either not answer the phone or do nothing about the issues.
4 It's a maze of toys that you won't find at most department stores.   I like the organization. It makes it easy to go the the area you want. All toys in their proper spot, divided into Toddler toys, board games, stuffed animals, learning toys, dolls, sports toys, action figured, cars, etc.   I was serious about the maze thing, lol. There is 1 entrance and 1 exit and they are not interchangeable :) When you first walk in, because they know children so well and their ability to walk in a door and then break out into an all out sprint in all directions, you are guided through a few isles that curve around (they are chalk full of toys, of course) and THEN you get to the main isle.   My check out experience was awesome. The lady actually noticed that I was hiding something my nieces view and she made sure to scan it when she wasn't looking and to double bag it :D I love her.   Prices range, but the toys here do seem to be pricier in general compared to most department stores, but like it said, they have a much wider variety.
1 Okay so I went in here today and I need to do couple of things I cannot find help anyway the employees were rude they said don't be right back and they never come back meanwhile I stand there for 15 minutes I continue looking from my things and not once did I get offered any help to start his big gigantic chaos mess stores dirty and no employees around to help you find things, also the parking lot is fairly small so you do have to park farther away into someone else's parking lot but they're all touching itches so many mom I would recommend going earlier in the morning but not in the afternoon. But it is Christmas and it is a mess.
