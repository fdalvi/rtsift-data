4 Well I just called to ask what time they closed. Kathy answered the phone and told me they were about to close. So I asked one question. The next thing I know she helping all over the place. What a great employee. They should be glad to have her.
4 They usually have only 2 employees working so it may take a little while for you to get some service but they have one of the best selections of frames that I've seen. Pricing is mid-range, although you can usually find coupons on their website
5 First off the very best thing about this place is the extremely friendly and helpful employees.   The store itself is dominated on the left by a fairly good sized and well equipped framing department. Compared to other framing shops, their prices are good and they have a good selection of archival glass and acrylic to choose from. I have not actually used their framing services (yet) so I can only comment on my impressions from talking to them and looking at their set up.  The shop itself is a mix of art supplies, including what looks like a decent selection of canvas, pens, paper etc., as well as "crafty" stuff and some straight up nick knacks. Their selection strikes me as a cross between an old school classic art supply store and and "Arts and Crafts" store like Michaels. If you need art supplies, there's a decent chance they'll have it.
