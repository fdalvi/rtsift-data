3 Stopped in for a LARGE iced coffee and a breakfast biscut sandwich.  The iced coffee was much larger than most coffee shops and hit the spot.   The drive thru was busy but the restaurant inside had a small family enjoying breakfast and me.  I found the location to be clean and the service friendly.  Oh yeah and the bacon for my breakfast, real bacon, I'm impressed.
2 Don't like fast food, but sometimes you just have to settle.   They added lettuce when I said not too....  spicy chicken wrap tastes ok for fast food
5 For a Wendy's, I really like this one. Everyone is always really nice to me, and the store is super clean. No complaints.  Also, these chains need to start posting their hours!
2 Positive: fast and accurate service. Close to my office.   Negative: Nothing ever tastes right. The fries are limp and the frosties have an odd taste and texture. The chili is served the wrong side of warm.
1 Wendy's is no luxury dining experience in any case, but this one is exceptionally bad.  The ketchup dispensers are broken, but the staff doesn't care.  The cashier used more obscenities than I would like my six year old to hear.  The dining area was dirty.   Worn paint and damaged seating everywhere.  The bathrooms have a gas station feel to them.  The food is low quality, even by Wendy's low standards.    If you must eat here, get it drive through and keep your expectations low.
3 Wendy's.  It was raining today in Phoenix!    Flatbread sandwich. With medium fries and dp.  Medium is like 20 oz of soda.  I ate the food - it was fast food quality.
3 Thus Wendy's is usually pretty good.  Busy location. The food is always hot and fresh.
3 Always had good food here, just went in for a frosty float and the lady at the window barely spoke to me. I got my order pretty quickly considering the long line ahead of me, but no line is long enough that you can't say thank you or "have a good evening" to a customer.
