4 Got a pizza and a 15 piece wing sampler of all three of their flavors (Lime 'N Pepper, Buffalo, and Garlic Con Queso)  Loved it all.  Especially the wings!   It's nice having some place good to eat when you work on this side of town.  It's BRAND new at the time of writing this, so my only complaint was the relative cluelessness of the staff. But they were friendly, which is good enough for me.  It's gonna be a regular place to eat lunch for me...
2 I can't really tell if having a pepperoni pizza tasting like popcorn was a good thing or a bad thing.  It was even more odd because I know that wasn't intentional.  For a $5 pizza, it is what you would expect it to be.  But I would actually prefer going to Little Caesars over this.    I more than likely won't be coming back here again.
4 I come here alot especially for there wings damn there so good.  What you dont believe me come on down and try some and if you dont oh well more wings for me lol.
4 Absolutely LOVE this place. 4.99 wings and 1 topping pizza! Used to like the square pieces better, but now have switched to normal triangle cutting. Love the service and prizes! Prefer Patron over Ceasers any day! :)
