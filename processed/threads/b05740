5 news, entertainment, online, one of the only papers with color comics everyday!!
5 This review goes out to the Paper Route Delivery Drivers.  There is no more  one reliable group of people anywhere.  Did you know that they NEVER get a day off!!! Not even the United States Post Office can say that. So if it's raining, or cold, Christmas Day or Easter Morning, disaster by man or mother nature, alien invasion or the likes, remember your paper delivery person and know that they are out there doing the best they can to make sure that your paper gets to you.  Instead of calling to complain about a missed paper, why not give a shout out or the other 364 days that you did???
2 My one big suggestion is to make the on-line service for the Obituary section more clear, and concise. Unfortunately, I didn't find out until I had already submitted my loved one's obituary that the photo I uploaded was not accepted due to an additional $100 charge that was not in writing on the package I selected. There's a photo upload option when you are filling out the info, but at no point does the page explain this price difference. Either way, I find it a bit much to charge $100 for a black and white tiny photo to be printed in the Obit section.
1 This "newspaper", if you can call it that, is absolutely awful. Articles from this paper are full of  inaccurate statements and the paper's editors are absolutely ridiculous. Very low-quality journalism. Truly, you would be far better off reading basically any other paper about events in Las Vegas or just any other paper in general.
