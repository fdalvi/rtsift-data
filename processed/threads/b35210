5 Kirsten was very helpful. My boyfriend is getting back into working out again and she was very knowledgable about the products at the store. We will most likely be coming back and would recommend people to visit this location.
5 Verdict: Friendly service + Fully stocked shelves = Best GNC in the area!  I only come to this location to pick up what I need because they always have everything in stock. Usually I'm here every week to pick up a box of Quest bars (Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough), and they've NEVER let me down! *knock on wood*  I purchase all my supplements online now, but if I need something right away, this is my go-to spot.
5 The staff here is incredibly friendly and will help you out with whatever you are looking for.  They also help out greatly with price matching with local competitors along with having a really good stock amount of products.
