5 I have been searching for a computer repair place to upgrade my tower PC from Windows XP to Windows 7 and migrate all my Outlook Express files to Outlook.  Apparently this sounds too involved to the 5 or 6 companies I approached only 2 ever even gotten back to me but quoted me open-ended service charges I never went.  Anyway, just when I was desperate to get this done, this new store opened up right next to the UPS Store where I rent a box.  Joe at the UPS Store told me how great Matt & Dave helped him with this laptop so I decided to give them a shot.  Boy am I glad I did!  A "simple" job took from 6/13/14 to 6/24/14 but they kept at it despite how involved it got.  Others would have long given up but they honored their word and their price.  I am now typing this review on this "new" computer.  I am soooooooooooooooooo glad I bumped into them.  Give them a try and you will not regret it.  They fix PCs, laptops, phones, TVs, tablets, etc..
5 Couldn't be more pleased! Friendly employees and great service. My fan to my laptop was making a horrible noise and driving me crazy. I bought a new fan off ebay so my boyfriend could replace but it was too much work. I called them and they said it would take an hour, turned out my 5 year old computer's fan was running poorly because it was so dirty and getting stuck. $80 was so worth my sanity and how fast it was able to be done. Other places were asking $150 for a starting price. Thank you!
4 This place is great. They are courteous and polite.  We took our laptop there and it was fixed the exact date and with the exact charge that was stated.  I would recommend them to all my friends.  I will be a returning customer.     H. V. B
