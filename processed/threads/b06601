2 Good quality work, but you can tell that the location affects the prices they charge.  Over $80.00 for adjusting the length on three pairs of pants?  No thank you.
4 Have had alterations and repairs done here a number of times.  Always good quality and they've made some repairs that I thought couldn't be done.  Occasionally have used the weird thread color so that's the only knock.  Prices seem reasonable to me.
3 I don't want to be too negative, because this is the only experience I've had with a Madison tailor and from the other reviews I've seen, there aren't any great alternatives.  That said, my experience with Mary's was just okay.  I moved here from NYC where my local midtown tailor was much  friendlier, cheaper and faster.  Mary's charged me 19 to replace a zipper in a pair of jeans (it was a side zipper, on the seam, with no fly, hence a very easy job).  It took a little over a week to do the replacement.  I was scheduled to pick up the pants on a Friday.  I was planning to be in the neighborhood late Thursday afternoon, and so I called (18 hours before my scheduled pickup) just to check to see if they were ready.   The woman I spoke with told me "if they are scheduled to be done tomorrow, you must pick them up tomorrow."  No "let me check" or "I'm sorry but we haven't gotten to them yet."  They did a decent job with the zipper but for nearly 20 bucks I would have at least liked a more pleasant experience (could they manage a smile or a thank you?).  I am commited to supporting local businesses but Mary's doesn't inspire a lot of loyalty.  For a simple fix, next time I'll just do the work myself.  For bigger jobs, I guess Mary's will do.
5 Mary's is the best for alterations in Madison.  The young woman who works there is super friendly and a talented seamstress.  They are consitently quick with their alterations and friendly.  When I am in Madison I will only come here for my alterations.  Price is average for their alterations.  I remember giving them the difficult task of making a "bell bottom" jean into a skinny leg jean.  The alteration looks flawless, you can't tell it was once a retro jean, and the cost was $20.  Support local businesses!  We need Mary's in Madison for a long time.
2 They did a good job hemming some skirts that were too long, but I gave them two pairs of designer jeans that needed patching because they had ripped in the inner thigh area. This happens to most of my stretchy jeans/jeggings and have had them fixed in other cities several times before. They are never like new but many places I've been to have patched them well enough that you can't really tell. Not here. They completely ruined the two pairs of jeans by patching them with colors way too light and on the outside. It looks like my 92 year old grandmother did it. Actually, she would have done a better job.   I'm going to try other tailors. In a pinch I would have them hem something but I will never trust denim to them again.
