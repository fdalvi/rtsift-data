5 If you like raw oysters that are not small and have great flavoring and meat on them... This is the place... Order Louisiana Oysters and be prepared not to share... LOL... They have big flat screens to catch the game or great creole food to have lunch.. Don't forget to ask for the flat bread...amazing
3 I'm an oyster freak.  Yes, I'm talking about oysters, the food you actually eat and nothing else.  The thing is, I love oysters so I'm always looking for the best oysters in town.  I didn't like their oysters too much.  There seemed to be a very bad after taste to it.  My taste buds weren't too impressed.  For the price to pay, I wouldn't go back unless it's the last place where you can sit down and be served.
4 This place was amazing. I was there with my family  for the first time for dinner and the service was great, I had the oysters and they were delicious! As for my entree I had the Pan Roast with rice. It is to die for =) Im definately coming back again!
1 I just stayed @ the Red Rock (6-15 to 6-17) and I think (sadly) that The Tides is no more. I didn't ask, but I couldn't find it! Settled on Salt Lick BBQ- yeech.
4 We had dinner at Tides Oyster Bar using a 2/1 coupon from a locals mailer.  Tides is a spacious restaurant offering both table and, the more traditional, counter seating.  Ms. Westie ordered a cup of New England clam chowdah (we are from CT and know how to pronounce chowder) and a seafood Cobb salad (micro greens, tomatoes, crab, avocado, carrots, shrimp and blue cheese).  My entr√©e was a super sized piece of parmesan crusted red snapper over an almost spicy tomato sauce.
