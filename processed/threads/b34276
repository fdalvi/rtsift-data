2 "It tastes like something you would get on an airplane..." - that's what The Man said of the croissants we had at Blackwood Coffee this morning.  He then went on to say "...which would be fine because it would be free and it would fill a hole, but even then you wouldn't finish it."  But, having paid £8 for two dense, stodgy croissants and two flavourless (other than bitter) flat whites, it wasn't fine.    I couldn't help but think of Artisan Roast and their tutorial about pulling the perfct espresso, and how if any of them came in here they would probably have refused to drink the coffee.  First of all, at £2.25 it was served in the tiniest cup I've ever seen.  I realise flat whites are smaller than lattes but this was ridiculous.  Mostly though, it was the taste.  Rich?  No.  Toasty?  No.  Bitter and somewhat reminiscent of an IPA (not kidding)?  Yes.    I hate myself for saying this, but I would have had a better coffee at Starbucks.  Yes, I said it.
4 New Year's Day walk lead to a stroll along morningside way took me and Steph here. They were one of the only places to be open so expectations were not high.  Saying that it was actually really good. We had a tea and a coffee as well as a scone, was less that £6 and was good home-baked standard. Well worth a visit I would say.
3 Great cakes and good coffe. Fairly limited menu though but it is perfect for a quick break or treat on the way home.
