4 I had always sworn off chiropractors. I think it was the popping sounds that make me nervous. I decided to go to Cottingham, who was recommended by a coworker, as a way to lure in my fiance who was in constant pain. I gave Cottingham 4 stars as this is my first experience and I really had nothing to compare it to. But I do think Jeff is a 5 star guy. On your first visit he will do an exam and take xrays. On your second return he will go over the xrays and plan of care. Being in the medical field, I think Jeff is very good about explanations and helping you understand things visually and physically. His knowledge comes across and made me feel more comfortable with the whole process. I didn't feel he was trying to push me into any unnecessary treatment plan. I'm just sorry I waited so long.
1 Never made it to the office because the male phone operator was so incredibly rude and had SUCH awful phone manners that I opted not to go in.  For example:  Me: can I send you my insurance information in advance so that I know if you accept my policy? Him: Ummm, I don't know when I will have time to check into it.   Me:  I am in quite a bit of pain right now, I guess I will find someone who has time.  Goodbye.
