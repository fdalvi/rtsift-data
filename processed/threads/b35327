4 This Circle K Just opened, and it is definately a valuable asset to this area.  Gantzel Farms store no longer has a monoply, and local competition in the conveniance store department is always a good thing.  Everything is new, so the store is obviously nice - Bathroom is clean, staff is friendly.  VERY busy, since it is new - A bit of a wait each time I am there, but the low prices make up for it.
5 So glad that Circle K came to our area. I fill up here at least once a week. I am happy to see many others doing the same. The Chevron across the street has been raping us out here for years, so I am happy to give someone else my business.
5 Thank goodness for this new Circle K!  The other 2 were filthy and disgusting and management would not do anything about it. I complained about the one on Hunt Hwy so many times. There is slime on the ice dispensers. It is so gross!  Also, nice to see that the Chevron has a little competition.
2 Have been back to this Circle-K numerous times since my initial review, and I must say that it has really gone downhill fast!  Very slow service, constant waits, and pretty dirty-looking countertops, food area, etc.    Staffing always seems minimal, and I think this explains all of the above.  Now this is just another Circle-K.....  Go to Gantzel Farms Country Store across the street for better service, cleaner facilities, and similar pricing.
