5 Great people and a very good selection at this classic style hobby shop.  Lots of consignment items so the selection is different every time you go.  They also have better R/C helicopter selection than any other area shops.    Fun place to go and hang out as well as shop.
4 The best hobby shop in town. Lots of parts  and if they don't have they can have it the next day in most cases. The staff Is very helpful and they will help you out on anything you need done.
5 In the past Viper Hobbies was a place I tried to avoid. Mainly because of the poor customer services and lack of experience by the employees. Today it's a whole new story! I don't know if the store changed owners or if the just stepped up the services but the change was for the better. Now they have a very helpful and knowledgeable staff willing to spend time with customers. The store is jammed packed with products and most of the time they will have what you're looking for. Good job guys!! Keep it up!
