5 Great great service, I dropped my Wii off on a Wednesday morning at their shop in Las Vegas and was able to pick it up the same day. David and Eric and the whole staff at Video Game Repair were extremely knowledgeable about Xbox, Wii, Ps3, Iphones basically everything it was quite shocking. They definitely were a bright bunch that truly cared about helping their customers, and I will definitely be recommending all my friends to their shop. A+++
5 I was in Las Vegas with my kids and PS3 stopped working.  It became a problem because my kids spend hours playing with it everyday.  I did not want to use Sony's expensive, unreliable repair/replacement program and I decided to take the PS3 to A Video Game Repair.  I contacted them and left a message and within a few hours  they called me back and gave an estimate, I told them to go ahead and fix it and within 2 more hours the PS3 was working again and my children were so happy.  I thought it was going to take more time to get things done and of course I thought it was going to be more expensive but Video Game Repair gave me an excellent price to fix it.  I am very happy with the services they provided, thanks a lot for so much professionalism.
