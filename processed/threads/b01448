5 They are always so friendly at this location. They are also very knowledgeable and will tell you how it really is. At some other pool stores, I have felt like they are trying to sell you on things you don't need. We had an expensive piece of pool equipment break and thought we would need to have it replaced. We dragged it on down to Leslie's and they repaired it for about 1/2 of the cost of replacing it. I refer anyone with a pool to Leslie's - especially this location.
1 My 76 year old mother went in to buy replacement pads for her pool vacuum and was treated extremely rudely by Bob. He was the only person there, busy, and spoke in an ornery tone. I was on the phone listening to him yell and just talk like a jerk to my mom and other customers. Bob needs some anger management classes. And this store needs to ditch Bob in place of someone who can be polite and knows a thing or two about customer service. NEVER patronizing this store again.
5 I moved into a new house and we now have to take care of our own pool, I know a bit but Daniel and the team here really know their stuff.   They have made it really quick and accurate with the WaterLink Spin machine-I had been to another pool place that used the traditional fluid test and besides it taking a while to do the test and get results it just didn't seem accurate. This works! My pool is clear and the family is happy to swim in a once greenish and algae tinted pool.   Thanks guys-knowledgeable, friendly, fast and fair service. Not a buy and try this-these guys know customer service and you will be with them long term because they recommend only what's necessary.
