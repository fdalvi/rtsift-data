3 The staff was friendly and service was provided in a timely manner.  It was also a great place to sit out the "snow storm".  I might not ever get back to this location, but it was a clean and pleasent location
3 Pros: consistent food. New and clean. Nothing tastes like the Whopper. Onion ring sauce.   Cons: waited in the drive thru for 15 minutes at 530pm. Way too early for dinner time crowds, right? Not fast food! Why can't I stay away from Burger Kings? I always give them negative reviews for service.
4 The helpful female behind the counter casually taking my double whopper meal order just a few mins before closing with a  friendly smile on her face was enough to forget your in a sketchy area late at night. I very much enjoy my endless options at the soda machine and the clean tables in the dining area.
3 Not a bad place. Service is good with friendly employees. The food, although not the beat does taste good and is fresh.  While there I had the angry whopper. Im not a fan of thick french fries, but theirs was still good.   What I liked most was their choices of soda. They have "orange coke" flavored soda. I never even heard of it before, so I had to try and and wow. Was it good.    Sadly the whole time I was thinking there they never swept the floor that needed it. Yeah its a small thing and I am not going to eat off it, but visually it is not appealing. The same is true of their bathroom floor.
