4 I love the lightness of cakes from all parts of Asia. So, naturally grabbed a slice of pandan and saw that there was a special posted - buy a slice and get coffee at a discount - yum. Well, the gal at the counter was confused at my request for the coffee and cake combo, but we worked it out. I prep my coffee and have a seat in their dining area and...wow, the coffee had a richness that I was not ready for; so happy! The cake which is good on its own, was taken to new heights accompanied by that strangely delicious cup of joe.
