4 Was there on Jan 10, 2011. Haven't got a haircut from super cut forever!!! The two last girls running the store during the few mins of closing were awesome! And pretty cute too! Just wish super cut lowers their prices again.
2 Slow and impersonal. Decent prices but I will not bring my daughter back to this location. If you're not happy with your job, do something or go someplace else.
5 If you're stopping in,ask for Madison. She cuts my hair every time I'm in and she's fantastic! Super personable and friendly as well.
