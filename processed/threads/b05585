4 This Subway is really tiny, but the service is always good and food is always fresh!
1 This is practically a drive-thru Subway and I decided to stop at this one because I didn't wan't my ass to explode from eating Little Caesars so I stopped here with my lovely lady.  I am 9999% sure the cashier was on acid or completely baked.  But when you stop mid order to make the sandwich and forget to ask what you want on your sub until it's completely made, it's pretty ineffective.    In a span of 10 minutes the phrases, "whuuut?" "Hold On...whut?" " Wait..." "Huh". "Um...ooh yeah" were used at least 3 dozen times.  And they didn't toast my meatball marinara subs.  #firstworldproblems #IwasGonnaMakeASubwaySandwich...ButThenIGotHigh #DoNotOrderDoNotLetThemCollectYourMonies
2 Only reason I give this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because its a drivethru!!!! I've been saying for years how awesome it would be to have a drivethru subway. But this place had like 4 tiny tiny tables to sit at inside, the lady who helped us had a crazy attitude AND they didn't have the veggie patty!!! What?!? That's the only thing I get at subway! So I ended up just not eating. Dumb!
