4 My friends and I finally got to experience a ridable miniature railway. On a whim while driving past the entrance of Wet N Wild water park, we decided to go into the Maricopa Live Steamers Railroad Heritage Preservation Society's complex across the street from the water park's entrance.  Members and volunteers run this fun little family ride from mid-September to early May. During the season, public rides are free every Sunday from 12 noon to 4:30 pm. The train setup provides four different half-hour tours that run on different routes utilizing13 miles of track. We were amused at the sight of the miniature bridges, houses, mines, and other model southwestern "scenery" along the route. We noticed that some of the scenery elements that have been exposed for so long to the hot Arizona sun needed replacement. That, and the fact that the volunteers also continue to add to the tracks and maintain the compound, should remind you to give a donation at the end of your train ride; there's a donation jar near the exit of the train ride station.

3 Being fair, I have to realize that there isn't a lot of cash flow here. I'll admit the little train ride was fun. Decorations really do need some work. I understand it's just meant to be funny but if it were as nice as some of the scenes in the mini model railroad building it would be a lot more interesting. An elephant and toy dump truck in the little western town?  The mini model train building and the scenes they create around them are really neat. It's fun to look around at the details and see things like little crime scenes near the tracks.
