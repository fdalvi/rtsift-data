3 It's selection of vitamins and supplements is huge. The walls are absolutely packed with bottles and boxes! Not only that, but the staff were incredibly knowledgeable about what they had and what I needed. Great place! I've even seen them offering samples of their B12 pills, which I have personally found really helpful on those depressingly long work days.
3 This store had a nice selection of stuff. It's not the best store, and I certainly won't drive out of my way to buy my supplements from here.  I was in the area and needed some extra B12 and some preworkout powder (I use Jack3ed). They didnt have the stuff I use, so I was about to leave, when I saw a sale on resveratrol. I bought some because I know it can pump you up. And also prevent cancer. I hate cancer.   In any case, the guys working behind the counter were your typical meatheads. The kind who work out a little too much. They are bursting out of their dress shirts. Probably take their workouts a bit too seriously. The kind who go to the gym with workout diaries and call eachother "brah". Not really my thing.   I'd come back if I had no other choice, but I'll stick to my GNC's and Max Muscles.
4 It's my "go to" place to pick up Vitamins and Supplements.  They have 100 mg 7-keto DHEA here, 30 ct at a decent price.  I also like to browse their discounted items basket priced at $1 and up. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vitamin-world-tempe?select=81SC-c6dGDGJPQ1KfBEQhA#81SC-c6dGDGJPQ1KfBEQhA  The only thing is that this store is far from my house, otherwise I'd come more frequently.
