5 Karen is the best.  Her specialties include therapy for individuals, couples & children:               Anxiety and Depression             Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)             Chronic Illness             Betrayal/Divorce             Grief and Loss             Major Life Transitions  I added her business to yelp because this is something people SHOULD be yelping about.  Great food reviews are nice, but Karen is actually helping me become a better person - which is pretty cool.  I was a complete "Doubting Thomas" prior to spending time with her, but she's sweet, and I would recommend her to anyone.  GREAT JOB KAREN!!
5 Karen has a gentle and easy way of making you understand the patterns in your life.  She helps you turn these patterns into positive paths.  I love her energy and she has helped me in my life in amazing ways. I would highly recommend her.
