5 Today we found a fantastic consignment store right in the Las Vegas Premium Outlet South Center. They have a great variety of clothing, jewelry, shoes, and accessories for women. Bonnie and Judy are an absolute delight to shop with and they are a great help. Lots of name brand and brand new items at a great price.  Open daily from 10-6 and they also have champagne Saturday the last Saturday of every month where they do 50% markdowns on selected items and 25 percent off if all jewelry.  Where else would you find Two pairs of brand new shoes for 37$?? I'll be back here for sure!  Check them out you won't be disappointed!
5 Oh my and lucky me to find this jewel in the dessert.  This boutique is one of the loveliest I've seen with great prices.  The apparel and accessories are unique and GORGEOUS!  They had everything I needed from Vegas Bling, belts, bags and beaded gowns to Vegas casual chic...and it's all posh.   I thank you so MUCH Bonnie and Judy for your help and kind attention.  My mother and I had the best time shopping and will be seeing you again soon.
