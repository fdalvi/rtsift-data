5 Dr. Martin Rocks!  I have been to several chiropractors over the years and the care I received in this office is exceptional.  I trust Mr. Martin with all my healthcare decisions and I refer friends and family in for his expertise.  Stop suffering form pain and go see him you won't reget it!
5 As a golf professional, I am in continual need of adjustment. I have had many chiropractors and physical therapists work on me and none have  displayed the knowledge or thoroughness that comes easily to Dr. Martin. Choosing a chiropractor can be a difficult decision, Dr. Martin's expertise makes the decision much easier.
5 I would highly recommend Dr. Martin to anyone who is looking for not only quality chiropractic care but also a neurology background that provides a totally different insight to my health concerns. He takes into account your overall body and mental wellness, which means he finds solutions for complete systems, rather than isolated symptoms.
