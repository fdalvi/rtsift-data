5 Saw Rodney at a convention, at first glance I thought it was some sort of rock star or a-list celebrity since there was a huge crowd surrounded around him. As I weaved through the crowd and inched closer, I saw Rodney completely blindfolded with his hands out borrowing objects like a drivers license and credit cards as he named the exact names on license and birth dates, he even got the exact numbers on the credit cards! Simply Amazing! He's an auspicious performer with charisma and great humor! A MUST SEE
5 Rodney Reyes is the real deal! When you think of a magician you think of a person capable of doing the impossible. And let me tell you Rodney was doing the impossible at this private event held a at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, Las Vegas in a gorgeous suite. My friend who works in the biochem industry invited me to this event, where I met Rodney. He borrowed my signed quarter and right in front of me, concentrated as it melted in my hand. IMPOSSIBLE! Then he took my cellphone made it vanish and re-appear in to a sealed box that was in full view the whole time. I've seen all the big vegas shows and all the tv magic but nothing can make give your an experience so visceral you'll be talking about it for years! Fantastic magician worth while finding his shows or booking him for an astonishing experience!
5 Book him now! We hired him through a mutual friend who recommended him as a traffic stopper for our booth at the convention and Rodney's a total lead generator!  We always hire fun entertainment to help capture attention and create leads. Over the years our entertainment has consisted of  beautiful models, musicians and high tech gadgetry but Rodney was an ultimate attraction. He's funny, witty and has a great energy about him that knows how to make his clients happy! Great job, great magician!
