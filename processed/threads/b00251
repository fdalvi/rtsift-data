3 In August we had 4 new tires installed.  Whether tires, brakes, or other mechanical issues we have received satisfactory service over the years.
5 The manager and mechanics are kind, honest people who provide phenomenal service. I went in to have my muffler and center pipe replaced due to rusting issues.   They saved me $600 over the dealership service quote, had the required parts delivered within the hour, and finished the maintenance itself in about an hour.    I felt entirely comfortable trusting my car to them, and plan to have all of my future servicing done here.
