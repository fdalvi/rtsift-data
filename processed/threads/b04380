3 I had skipped breakfast and this was the first place I saw on a route that had been changed this morning.  So with my morning coffee I also got a breakfast sandwich.  At 500 calories it did the job but I am not sure I would pick QT again by choice for breakfast.  This particular location had a higher mix of business folks to gardeners than most I have been in.
5 Air for your tires is free, awesome. QT does things right.
5 Favorite QT! Employees always greet you right as you walk in the door and they are super fast at checkout.
4 Get gas, coffee snack just about everything you could ask for. I'm surprised they are not selling clothing yet. That will probably be next year.   It is what it is.  There's only so much you can  write in a review.
