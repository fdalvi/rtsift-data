5 Shabnam did an amazing threading job on my eyebrows! I will definitely be coming back! :)
1 Never coming here again. Worst customer service experience I have ever had. The lady that was cutting my hair yelled at me for correcting her mistake and she did not even fix it. The Workers here really need to go back to cosmetology school  to relearn  the basics. She kept saying "not finish yet don't worry" just to shut me up! With this place you get less than what you pay for. I came in hoping for a great deal came out disappointed and angry. Don't waste your time in money your better off going to Fantastic Sams or Great Clips.
1 Went here to get my brows done.. NEVER again. She over waxed one brow, and left the other with random hairs sticking out. EWWW! She had NO clue what she was doing. Also, the place wasn't particularly clean.
5 My good friend introduce the place to me. I think Tian is the best!!! He is very friendly and professional.
