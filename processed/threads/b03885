4 I go here every time I need a new dress shirt or pants. Their prices are very reasonable, and the clothes are high quality. The last pair of pants I had were worn 5 days a week for 2 years before they wore out.
3 The accessories - wallets, purses, eyeglass cases, sunglasses, satchels, and  the like are great here. Prices are always reasonable. The clothing is not so hot, the selection is slim both in size and amount. The shoes for women are a little skimpy but the men's selection seemed to much better.
4 Holy CRAP! I found theeeeeeeeeeee most comfortable professional work pants here ... they look great (no freakin' pleats, thank you very much!). AND the hidden ingredient is a very small amount of Spandex entwined with the cotton giving them just a little bit of elasticity to make them insanely comfortable.  I'm thinking about buying a pair to use as pajama pants (well not quite but still .... ).
