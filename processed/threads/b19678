4 They may not have the biggest selection of clubs here, but they get a high rating from me because of how quick they regrip clubs.  The store is always pretty slow when I go in and they seem to be dying to do anything so it's the perfect place if you want your clubs regripped in a hurry. They did a whole set of irons within a couple hours and if you just have a club or two, and they aren't doing anything, they'll take care of it right then. Good prices too.  Like I said, they don't have a massive selection of clubs, but what they do have is good. I sometimes lustfully browse the irons and they always seem to have several sets on sale for a good price. They have a good selection of shoes, gloves, hats, etc too.  I'm not sure what other club repair work they do there, but I noticed that the area they have is pretty small so I don't know if it's much more than regripping.
4 I'm not a golf connoisseur and a very new golfer at that, but after a recent visit to Van's, I meow know where to turn when I need to find some golfing essentials. Van's is an intimate shop located off of 32nd and Camelback and not very large in size, however, they pack in a whole lot of merchandise! During my visit, I saw racks of golf shoes, rows of golf bags and golfing knick knacks galore. They even have a virtual driving range for golf lessons! The staff was friendly and helpful and it's obvious that they know their product and the sport. The store is tucked back in a small shopping center, so it wasn't very crowded when I went which means it's perfect for some one-on-one attention!  This is a great store to visit if you're looking for a good gift for a golfer because they have items that range in price. They have everything from golf books and gloves, to full golf sets and golf bags. I especially enjoyed the amount of UA Wildcat gear they carry! They also carry items from "the other school," but that's not worth mentioning because it's all about BEARING DOWN!
2 Let me start off by saying I love the vans metro location, but honestly this one is not up to par. I walked into the store today with full intent of purchase and was ignored for over 40 minutes while I browsed. I feel it was because I look young and older seasoned, more rich looking customers were coming in. I was skipped over at least 3 times and never even greeted or asked if I want help. The store is crammed and not well organized and the staff seemed pushy to the customers they were talking to. Eventually I walked out, and that hurts being the avid golfer I am. I will stick to the Vans Metrocenter location from now on and suggest it to other Yelpers. They did not stock the Club I was looking for but some assistance would have went a long way.   On a good note the store did have some good deals going, and seemed to be helping the regulars just fine...
4 Friendly service to an out-of-towner.
