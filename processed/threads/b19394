4 Favorite Sub Sandwich shop in Las Vegas.  I like their turkey & stuffing & cranberry sauce sub sandwich.   Small seating area.  Take-out is better.  Mostly good folks working behind the counter.
4 I am sure everyone has heard of Capriotti's but I have to add my two cents. Their sandwiches are so good, and a nice alternative to the chain sub shops. My personal favorite is the Bobbie, while my boyfriend always goes for the capistrami with double meat (ugh, why?). But here is my question, why are all of the staff beautiful young boys?! I have only seen one girl ever behind the counter at Capriotti's. The rest are these cute young things with a knack for making great subs, and girls sweat while they wait! I am in love and completely happy, but I am always begging my boy to go to Capriotti's. I think he is starting to catch on, but I don't care. Girls, Capriotti's has awesome sandwiches, and awesome eye candy while you wait...what could be better for lunch? (Caution: order in advance by phone, or you could get stuck waiting a bit...actually, this could be a good thing!)  Recommended sandwich: The Bobbie for a Thanksgiving-leftover-style sub.
1 Poor quality food, always dry and unpleasant... A lot of employees enjoy talking trash about their employer in front of customers. Sandwiches made incorrectly often. Would not recommend.  The owner has resorted to writing poor reviews for her competitors businesses, now reducing their business rating down to 1 star, in my opinion. Extremely childish.
5 The hype is real. Is this worth a $20 cab ride from the strip? Come on, it's just a sandwich. Let's not go crazy here... That being said, if you have a car/friend/etc, this place is incredible.   What makes it so special? You know that slimy deli turkey meat stuff they serve at subway and well almost everywhere? They don't use that here.. they use real turkey that tastes like leftovers from thanksgiving. As everyone says, the bobbie really is thanksgiving on a bun. I thought stuffing, cranberry, and turkey would be kind of sick, but honestly it's incredible and you must try it. If you're looking for a sandwich place that's different than your everyday deli meat place, try here. The Cran Slam Club is also incredible (if you have a fear of stuffing or feel it doesn't belong on a sandwich), as is the cheesesteak if you're some freak that doesn't like thanksgiving turkey.
4 Capistami Sandwich all the way!  YUM!  There's also a elvis look alike that works here - very entertaining.  Kicked back atmosphere inside.  Local magazines to browse while you wait to take out or eat at their bar.  (no alcohol served here though).
4 In Vegas for 3 days, ate here twice and took 2 home! The Capistrami is outstanding! We also had  the Slaw Be Jo I think it was called? The meat was a bit dry, but the Capistrami and the service made up for it!!!
5 My parents lived in Vegas for awhile and introduced me to this FANTASTIC sandwich place. Now every time I am anywhere near a Capriotti's, I have to go. I absolutely love the "real", Thanksgiving style turkey on it! No compressed mystery turkeyloaf here! The cheesesteaks are excellent too, just avoid the hot peppers unless you have a hankering to burn off a few of your tastebuds. YUM!!
5 Been loving Capriotti's for years. Fresh cold cut sandwitches. They have the best hot n cold subs in town.
4 I'm so glad other people like the Capistrami here, I'm hooked on them!  Everytime we order them at work, I always get the Capistrami.  A lot of people don't like cole slaw, but I love it, and when it's on my sandwich, it's a win/win.  Their slaw is good typical, it's got a nice sweetness, but not as bad as KFC (whose slaw is just insanely sweet for no good reason).   The Capistrami is this-  Pastrami, Swiss Cheese, Russian dressing (1000 Island) and cole slaw.  It's simplicity in it's best.   And it's by far one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.
4 Well, wouldn't you know, I just wrote a review and now I get to enjoy one!  Delicious, peppery/sweet, but not too sweet slaw.  Flavorful thinly sliced pastrami, just enough cheese and russian dressing.  I'm in heaven.
5 one New Year's resolution is to write more Yelp reviews, so here goes...  In Vegas for NYE & gave this place a shot per other Yelp reviews. I had the Capistrami & the girlfriend had the Cheese Steak, which I had few bites of. Both were absolutely delicious in an awesome-deli-sandwich-sort-of-way. The shop is no-frills with only some bar seating, but the sandwiches are really reasonably priced. So if all you're after is a fantastic deli sandwich, definitely go.
5 The last time I went to Vegas was the first time I had Capriotti's. We had to go twice that weekend because it was so delicious. It's few and far between when you find a sandwich place that offers imitation meat for us vegetarian folk.   The vegetarian philly cheesesteak sub is my favorite. The flavors are magical and the imitation meat they use is superb. The turkey sub is also very delicious, tastes a lot like a real turkey sandwich, comes with delicious veggies and served on a kaiser roll!
5 #1 in Vegas for a reason.  Everyone has their favs.... the capistrami, the cheeseteak with mush...  Mine is definitely the Bobby.  In case you haven't viewed their menu yet, the bobby is thanksgiving leftovers in a huge sandwich... yeah, exactly.
5 I just had Capriotti's and their turkey with cranberry was one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time. I hope a franchise opens up in Orange County, CA because I would be there every other day!
4 Had the HOT ITALIAN SUB (Genoa salami, ham and cappicola). The meat was piled high with pickles lettuce tomatoes and mustard. It really hit the spot. You can rely on this place to satisfy any sandwich craving.
2 This review is for the location not the food. It seems kind of rough to me...including: the ex worker who came in and stated that if she was still working there no one would be smoking... they would be back here doing the dishes and cleaning the floor to the overall cleanliness or lack there of everything else. The window, walls, door, etc...need to be cleaned. I would think with the corporate headquarters in Las Vegas you would not find a store/location in this condition...it didn't get this way overnight.
2 It took like 20 mins for my sandwich, I asked if they had cappacola and they had no clue what that was... kinda strange but whatever. I didnt understand why it took soo long for my food, I order 1 small sub and I was the only person there... plus there were 3 workers! wtf?!   I was like sooo super excited because I heard great things about this place! So I get to work and unwrap this mystical creature and bam! Its like my hard on went away! I asked politely for no tomatoes or onions... what do you think I see?! So I was like ugh. I sat there and poked out all the yuckiness and took a bite and almost choked because of the insane amount of pepper!   I will not return, Ive had wayyy yummier sandwiches from 7-11.
4 Mmmmm, not usually a fan of coleslaw but theirs is good!! Went here 2-3 times and got the Capastrimi every single time. Now this is a sandwich that I can't finish since it's huge but it's delicious! I've only ate here when we have cars in vegas and when I'm not on the strip!
5 Best sandwiches.
5 best capriottis in the valley!!!!! have had a few if the subs but you can not beat the bobbie. its like a thanksgiving feast without having to deal with your crazy family. but this shop is on there A game, some of the shops i have been to cant seem to put the sandwich together so it will not fall apart when you eat it .   dont be a cheap ass, Tip them. go there enough and do it and you might get expedited service during lunch.
1 The thing that frustrates me the most about yelp reviews is you don't know the level of taste from the people who are reviewing. This place was gross. The pastrami, which was one of their signature sandwiches was terrible. Soggy bread. Too much sauce, of course to cover up the quality of the meat. If you're a true foodie don't waste your time.  I did want to mention, to those foodies in search of something special, there is an Asian market in the same mall that has an off the hook hot food bar with homemade egg rolls and incredible Asian delectables.
5 The best cheese steak and pastrami sandwich in Vegas. this is a place for take out. They have a sitting area but its small and not to comfortable. But the sandwiches are great!!!
5 I have always loved Capriotti's and found they have the best philly cheese steaks in Vegas (and beyond).   However, I decided to try the Tuna Sub yesterday and all I can say is WOW. Best Tuna Sub ever.  I never thought I would have to leave a great review for something as simple as a tuna sandwich, but after eating that one, I had to tell the world - lol.  So, I will continue to spread the good word about the great food at Capriottis and continue enjoying the best sandwiches in Vegas.
2 Capriotti's is a very popular sandwich/sub shop in Las Vegas...  I have tried several locations and i do like their food... This location however, sucks my ass.  The steak sub was not filling as they usually are at other locations.  I asked for easy on the hot peppers, well they kinda over did it, completely making the sandwich un-edible..  Perhaps the saying easy on the hots, is beyond their comprehension. Their staff, what a bunch of tools...Food may be decent but the service, to me is a key factor in eating at a restaurant even if it is just a sub shop...  I recommend Capriotti's but not this location...   Hope this yelps
3 Love this place, ordered a large italian, and a large steak and cheese. Very nice and fresh, hot and spicy.   Little pricy but worth the money in my opinion,.  Order it for pick up. It was ready on time and good to go.
5 I give this place 5 stars because it is by far the best sandwich shop of it's kind.  Subway and Port of Subs aren't even worth mentioning in the same breath.  The sandwiches are delicious and huge.  Unlike the other sub places, this place actually has a fair amount of meat and other items in between the bread.  Not like some places where you have to pay extra dollars just for enough meat to actually taste it.  For me, it's all abou the spicy italian, with lots of these tasty chopped peppers.  Sure it's not $5 to eat, but I would rather pay a few extra dollars and get a sandwich that is filling, and taste way better than all others.  There is a Subway pretty much in the same parking lot as my job, but I would rather drive a few miles down the road any day to get Capriottis instead.
5 By far the best sub shop.  I haven't been to anyplace that had better tasting subs.  Just today I ordered a philly cheesteak with nothing but meat, cheese, and hot peppers and it was like an orgasm of the mouth.  The cheese was so melted into the spiced beef that it was almost like the beef was stirred in some sauce or something, hard to explain.  The peppers were hot which I loved.  I usually get the cold spicy Italian which is phenomenal as well, but today I tried something else.  Very happy with the service especially if you call it in ahead of time (no wait).  LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!
3 My 2 favorites are the Mushroom Cheese Steak and the Cole Turkey. I would eat here more often if they would get different rolls. The French bread is horrible. We have even bought whole wheat rolls from the store and remade the sandwich. The Cole Turkey really does not need the Mayo as the Cole Slaw and Russian dressing are enough. A large 20" feeds 3 adults and is a great value. Please get some new rolls.
1 I was visiting Vegas and we originally ordered from Capriottis on Warm Springs and Eastern but they constantly run out of roast beef and don't tell you until you are ready to pickup your order.  Again disappointed by this specific Capriottis we cancelled our order and went to JJs.    The sandwich establishments are in different classes but JJs is reliable.    I would have rated this review a 5 star instead of a 1 star if they would just tell me that they ran out of the specific ingredients before I drive down to be told they ran out of roast beef again.     I'm a fan of their other locations to include the one in Dallas as they never seem to have a supply shortage.
4 I love the Italian sub and the Bobbi's at Capriotti's. The sandwiches are huge and the meat is delicious! I always have the other half for lunch the next day. Check this place out!
1 I have to say first that I love Capriotti's. The sandwiches are delicious and the options are terrific.  However, this location's service has been poor to put it nicely. I let it slide the first time as a fluke, but the second time was nearly the same experience. The first time I called in an order shortly after 11 to beat the main lunch rush. When I arrived, they weren't exceptionally busy, but there were a few people there. I let them know I was there to pick up my order and I paid and started waiting. My bag was ready with 3 sandwiches and I was just waiting on one more. I literally waited 20 minutes for that last sandwich. I was asked several times what I was waiting for and I let them know, but that did not help.  The second time I decided to avoid the call-in debacle, so I ordered three sandwiches and brought two friends along to order 2 more each (we were picking up for our office). We were one of three orders they had to make at the time, so again, they were not slammed by any means. After a few minutes, my friends received their orders, but mine was waiting on ONE sandwich. I was asked again what I was waiting on and then informed them. Several minutes later and after 5 other groups got their orders, my sandwich was ready. I proceeded to the register and was ready to pay when they handed a call-in order to the person behind me and asked me to step aside so that they could pay.  What a slap in the face, I'll never return to this location.
5 Awesome sandwich.  We had the Bobby on our first visit.  Thanksgiving on a bun!  Delicious.  Nice people too.  Good value.
5 With all due respect's to Jarred's July 1 review, I decided to test them and place a take-out order... Bobbie with extra mayo and cranberry. When I asked, they said it would be ready in 10 minutes. So, 10 mins later my sandwich was already waiting for me, (and well-made). Staff was cheerful and friendly. No complaints!
1 Came here yesterday while I got off from work, their was a few people ahead of me, both parties had their orders done wrong and while I was waiting in line after 15 mins and the line grew bigger I said I want to place an order, she told me I have to go in the front of the store to place the order. I waited 15 mins for the lady to fix peoples orders, and the line grew bigger and she had the nerve to tell me that? I walked right out. I was more embarrassed then anything as well. I heard people even wispering on how i stood their for that long to be told to go in the back of the line. So rude, she could have kindly still took my order and take it too the front line cooks as she did with 2 parties in front of me.  I will never go their again. All other Capriotti's will still take the order where ever you go inside the store.
1 Their food is always very good, that is not the issue. This locations is a shit hole. It is so filthy and gross, if it were not for the fact that I was starving and the guy wore gloves so that I could watch him cook my meal, I would have left. Many of the Capriotti's need to get their acts together wtih cleanliness, namingly: Capriotti's near Anthem, E. Sunset Rd.and Stephanie St. Cesspools, everyone of them and I think that they are all the same owner. Shame on you all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2 The sandwich was great!!!! But my concern was about the fact that is no restroom over there so I couldn't wash my hands,  and instead of eating over there I went home, );
1 I was just about to place my order,  when I looked over the counter and saw how filthy it was.  The grill was black and food debris all over the counters. I immediately left and went to the Cappriotti's on Sunset and Annie Oakley. They are extremely clean. Thank God!
3 All the workers seem like they were hungover and take 30 minutes to get a sandwich made wtf.  But the sandwich WAS good. haha
2 1.5 - 2 stars  Yelp reviews say this place messes up your order a lot - didn't happen to me, however, it took the workers 15 minutes to make 2 sandwiches.  BF also says the grill was also yucky because it had a lot of junk on it.  Won't be back to this location due to service - but will be back to Capriotti's.
