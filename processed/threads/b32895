5 You won't find another workout that kicks your a$$ like HYBRID. One hour of sweat, weights, ropes, keg swings, rock throws, tires flips, sprints and of course state of the art sound system and projector.
5 Hybrid class!! Did it a few years back and to this day it's the best workout I've ever had. Will be going back FOR SURE
5 The bar fitness is the best place I have worked out ever, the members and the staff make it feel like it is a fitness family. It's hybrid trainer Ryan is my favorite trainer, and will push you to your best no matter how fit or unfit you are u will reach your future goal. I would recommend this to all my friends and family.
