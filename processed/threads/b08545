2 The price out on the sign for gas is the cash price. Its 10c a gallon higher if you use debit or credit. There is also a $5 minimum to use debit or credit in the store. I realize it costs money to utilize credit cards but that's the cost of doing business, Because of this extra fee for choosing not to carry cash, I will go out of my way to avoid this store and spend my money where they want my business.
4 It's actually the Shell Station now, not sure why they have this. Either way, this is a good place to get inexpensive and quality shell gas.

1 some how this place is a "shell" station, Its really a bodega/smoke shop that happens to sell gasoline. stay away unless you are out of gas or jonesing for some strawberry e-juice for your killer vape rig.
