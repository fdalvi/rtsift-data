5 I had the most AMAZING experience at this store.  Decy (pronounced Daisy) was absolutely wonderful.  So helpful and knowledgeable.  She was friendly and really made me and my bridesmaids feel important and cared for.  I would HIGHLY recommend this store and this consultant to everyone!
5 Adore Bridal is an incredibly cute little boutique. It is a consignment dress shop so it doesn't have a large selection but there is a wide variety of different styles. Decy is incredibly sweet and spent hours helping me try on dress after dress. I didn't find my dress here (given it was the first store I went to) but would recommend this store to everyone!
5 Such a great experience!  Decy was wonderful, and patient while I searched for THE dress.  The selection was awesome, and the prices were affordable.  I highly recommend!
