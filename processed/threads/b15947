4 Dr. Christensen isn't closed...I just saw him today for an exam. I was referred to him from Anthem Pediatric Dentistry and they were spot on. He was very nice, his staff couldn't have been more efficient and pleasant, Erika, his dental assistant, was very cool and didn't make me gag when she did the x-rays (always a plus in my book).   He took the time to answer all my questions and gave me some helpful suggestions for the mommy who has little time to do the extra stuff to take care of herself. All in all I am excited that Dr. Christensen is going to be my dentist. The only drawback is that he costs a good chunk of change if you are paying cash but he is well worth it. Dentists are like everything else in life...you get what you pay for....and you only have one set of teeth.
5 I've used Dr. C for several years. He is calm, and fast.  A great dentist. Cleanings are great. Staff is very pleasant. Can't go wrong if you are looking for a competent, relaxed dentist who knows your mouth :)
5 My wife and I have been seeing Dr Christiansen ever since we moved to Henderson more than 5 years ago. We have nothing but praise for his professionalism and the way he runs his business. He is also very personable and easy to talk to. He recently moved to his current premises on Jeffreys and bought with him all this great staff. I highly recommend Dr. Christensen for anyone looking for a dentist in Henderson area
