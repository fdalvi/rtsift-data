5 Funky antique goodies. I always find something cute and reasonable when I stop in. Great vintage linens, costume jewelry, furniture, knick knacks and some new items mixed in as well. Cards, balloons and great complimentary gift wrapping. The merchandise is constantly changing and so are the fun displays.
1 the lady smokes inside the store.  it is not an antique shop, just has a handful of old things mixed in. most stuff is shabby chic knock-offs--and a lot of it--stuffed in crannies all throughout the store.  she charges arbitrary prices for old photographs that are tossed in a drawer. when i suggested a bulk price for the many photos in my hand (most of them $0.75) she wouldn't go down on the ones marked $1 or more even though they were as curled and ill-treated as the rest of them.
2 Ew, no. This place stinks! Both the store itself, and the collection. I am a huge fan of vintage kitchen wares, and though they had a few items in the window, they were incredibly overpriced. I saw some cute aprons, but they were ripped and still $20. What?   St. Vincents down the street has some cute pyrex and other vintage mixing bowls and such for $2. Go there instead.
3 This store is now closed!   But before it was, it stocked a variety of retro jewelry, kitschy knick-knacks, and home goods.
