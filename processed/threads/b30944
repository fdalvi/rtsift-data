3 Three stars because the waitress was really nice.  However, this sports bar doesn't really measure up with some others I have been in.  At least it wasn't super crowded but would have been nice if they served food.
3 Their service was good. I wasn't all that impressed with their beer selection. Being from the Pacific Northwest, I have an abundant choice of breweries everywhere I go. They do sell pretty large beers for an alright price though! Naturally, its packed on game day but its a nice spot to sit & sip a beer if you are looking to relax for a few minutes.
1 extreme price gouging..1-tiny small Rum & Coke $13.58cents.  Watered down sewer water. Do people actually tip the bartenders at this rate???   its called ripping off the tourists. Wow...
