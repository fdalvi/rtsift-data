4 This is my GP practice for over 8 years now.  It is very conveniently located just of Elm Row in Stockbridge. The building itself is in need of upgrading but it is not that bad as it is a recent enough build. Accessible for wheelchair users. The Medical Center is occupied by 2 GP practices. mine is Dr Tolley's one. The GPs in this practice tend to stay a long time (2+ years or so). I feel really taken care of and listened to. The doctors I have consulted really take time to hear me out and find out what is wrong.  They also have medical assistants and practice nurses, whom are efficient and very friendly (bar 1 or 2 occasions). As I have a chronic condition I require repeat prescriptions. Which they let me order by email.  Opening times are until 6pm which makes it good for when you finish work and still need to visit them - saves taking time of work!  Good job Dr Tolley!
