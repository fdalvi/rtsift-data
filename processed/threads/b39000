5 This beauty supply is quite awesome. I got some Bobbi Boss for 30$. Score, right? I guess that's good even though I've never tried Bobbi Boss before. They even have a clothing store. I'll definitely be back again. They're friendly & helpful. Most beauty supply stores I've been to don't greet you & ask if you need help; they do! I really appreciate them!! Go by today!! I may even get some clothing next time. :) happy hair care shopping
