5 I wanted a pair of Chanel eyeglasses and Sharona Optical had just what I was looking for.  Not only did they have my Chanels but they offer the highest quality in lens options and the optician was very knowledgable in helping my choose lenses that work with my prescription.
5 Great selection of frames. Very knowledgeable and friendly opticians.
1 Slow, disorganized, and it felt like they were more interested in selling glasses, contacts and all the add-ons than the health of my eyes.  I've worn glasses and contacts for 20+ years, and this experience was noticeably different.  I'm sure the eye doctors are probably good...of my two hours in their office, I saw him for 5 minutes.  The rest of my time was spent in the waiting room, with an intern, and being up sold for all the add-ons around my contact and glasses (like a used car dealer selling you the sealer wax).  Pros:  solid selection of designer glasses, coffee while you wait in their lobby. Cons: slow, disorganized, limited time with actual eye doctor, seemingly focused on sales volume and turning patients.  Your mileage may vary, I have definitely come to expect more from my eye doctors and their staff.
