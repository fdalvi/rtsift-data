5 I am very happy with the haircuts my two boys received on two different occasions.  This proves to me that they can be consistent and do quality work.  The stylist was nice and patient with my sons.   I had forgotten to get my card stamped, so I called after leaving and although I normally would have lost the opportunity,  Katie (who was the boys' stylist) was very kind, understanding, accommodating.   Now, THAT is customer service!  So hard to find nowadays.    I would not hesitate to recommend the place and Katie to anyone!   Our family has found a new place to get haircuts.
1 I took my two year old here to get his hair cut and was basically told in a polite round about way to leave because they didnt want to cut his hair... They don't care to have my service and I don't care to go back
3 They took 1"-2" off the tips off our girls hair, no big deal. Did a complete wash before the cut. Twelve buck each, guess I can't complain.
