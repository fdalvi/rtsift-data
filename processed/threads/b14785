5 Danny and the others here @ Alphagraphics were AWESOME! We were up against a ridiculous time crunch and needed posters, flyers, line cards etc printed and they rose to the challenge and exceeded our expectations!  Everything turned out perfect and we will definitely use them again in the future!
2 2 stars only because they had done a satisfactory job for me last year.  This time they said they would call me back with an estimate for a job and never did.  I called back a couple of days later and the same woman said she'd get back to me as soon as her estimator got off the phone with another client.  Never did!  Can't see how they would be so busy if they don't return calls from potential clients.  I won't call them again!
1 I won't be back. Really bad customer service. I tried contacting the manager for a resolution and he basically said no. They ruined an item I brought to them and then they refused to replace it. This would be fine if I had agreed to that but I did not. The employee at the desk basically handed my ruined item back to me and said "sorry".  That was it. I am not impressed.
