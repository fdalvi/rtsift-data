5 Love! Love! Love! Dr. Pressley is FABULOUS! I haven't had an eye exam in over 6 years! The doc and her team tool their time and explained everything. I felt very comfortable! The team was knowledgable and helped me maximize my vision coverage. I am so happy with the treatment I've received and can't wait to pick up my new glasses! I highly recommend this office.
5 I had not had an exam in a couple years so I found Dr. Pressley's office and made an appointment.  The staff as well as Dr. Pressley  were very nice and helpful.  Everything was explained as it was being done.  They explained what all my benefits would cover and helped me find a new pair of glasses.
5 This office is amazing!!! I came in when they had just first opened their doors and man they did such an amazing job! Took care of everything with my insurance and had me in n out pretty fast (i came on my lunch break). Very efficent and i will always come back here !!!
