5 It's funny how I find myself at Costco whenever they can be found. I came here to find a huge case of Smart Water for my sister while she was recovering from a tonsillectomy. Of course, like any good Costco shopper, I left with a basket full of items I truly didn't need.   Costco's have standards. And they all are identical in style, form, and function. Their customer service is also eerily robotic, never faltering. There's no way I can complain about this Costco, because they do everything right. Heck, I've seen people returning used Christmas decorations after the holidays and they STILL take the stuff back. Their customer service is unreal.   It is pretty far West of central Madison. But I can understand their location is probably due to proximity to suburbanites and large family dwellings.
5 Not busy like the locations I'm used to on the east coast so I'm really happy that I can enjoy perusing the aisles in peace.   For some reason the samples still always run out by the time I get to it though :(
5 This review is for the pharmacy only.You do not need to be a member to use the pharmacy. I am a self paying user of generic Plavix...Cost for a 90 day supply is around is about $25. Contrast this to $45 at Walmart,and $200+ at both Target and Shopko. Price difference is unbelievable!! Begs the question of what price are health insurance carriers forced to pay!?? No wonder premiums are high should they be charged the 200-220 prices. It does pay to shop for prices..
3 I would give this Costco a better rating if they had not treated my mom like a criminal when she handed over my card because she forgot she needed to get her own upgraded card. The woman at the register acted as if my mom had committed a capital crime, when in fact, my mom is getting older and more forgetful. At customer service when it turned out my mom is in fact on the account and she had just neglected to get her own card as instructed a couple months earlier. An apology or at least losing the attitude would have been a nice treat from the cashier, but apparently that was too much to ask.
3 Given the choice between Costco or Sam's, I'll take Costco everydamntime, no exceptions. That said, there are a few dislikes:  - Long lines at checkout. Please, please, please open more checkout lines?  - Sample-pushers: There's normally a huge line of vultures/shoppers looking to pillage your free samples; if I walk past you because I'm either (a) not interested, or (b) in a hurry, please don't (all but) harrass me to try your product(s). If I'm curious about a product, I'll consider a sample.  - Variety/stock doesn't change too often.  - Christmas items out and on display for sale in August? Come on. Really??  - Fuel prices aren't much better than most local gas stations. You'll be lucky to save $0.02 or $0.03 per gallon, which on a 10-gallon fill equates to around $0.25... annual membership runs around $50, right? So you'd need to fill your gas tank 200-plus times to offset the membership cost (if all you bought was fuel; some of my friends do this, believe it or not!)  - Certain items aren't any cheaper than they are at Woodman's or elsewhere. Watch what you're buying - don't just assume everything is less expensive. Also, several manufacturers make products specifically for warehouse stores - for example, the 30-packs of soda. It's sorta' hard to compare prices "on the fly" when you're not dealing apples-to-apples.   And now for the pros:  + Kirkland products ROCK. I've never found anything to be substandard.  + The bakery and deli are fantastic. My coworkers regularly order birthday cakes from the bakery here and they're always delicious and a tremendous value.  + Carryout pizza, already cooked and ready to roll for $10? Yes please. And it's a massive 18" pizza that's better quality than the majority of the chain delivery places.   As a single dude, I don't purchase a ton of stuff here for me. I'd struggle to use 3.5-pounds of chips or 7-pounds of strawberries before they go bad. But, I do use Costco to purchase goodies for my coworkers, as well as to grab vitamins/supplements/protein drinks and a few other non-perishable things.
3 This a a nice Costco.   I went in for a quick lunch.   A buck 50 for a hot dog and soda....then 75 cents for some chips.   The service was quick and friendly.   One person took my order and another made the hotdog and had it ready immediatly.
4 Costco is the absolute bomb for saving money.  Being able to buy   A few tips:  The Kirkland Signature alcohol is actually made by the major labels.  The vodka?  Made by Grey Goose.    There are two membership levels for non-business owners.  Executive and Gold.  Get the Executive.  Even though it's more expensive, you get cash back on all your purchases which, if you spend more than $100/month at the store ends up paying for itself, so your membership is effectively free.    Arrive around noon on a Saturday and prepare for lunch.  If you don't fill up on samples, have a cheap pizza or hot dog and soda.  Fantastic.  Get. The. Rotisserie. Chicken.  Seriously.  $5 begats a meal for several people or for several days.  Perfectly cooked as well.  It won''t disappoint.    Overall Costco is a great experience.  The employees are friendly and helpful, and the prices make it worth the journey.
5 I love Costco! It has really helped me save money when shopping for my big family. The employees give excellent customer service and they all seem so happy. Even when it is busy the lines at the registers move fast. I would highly recommend Costco to anyone wanting great savings and good service.
4 Very strange to review a store like this.  Seems obvious - you go in, you buy stuff, you leave.  Pretty simple.  I've been there many, many times.  And I must say, EACH time I'm there, the employees are very helpful and friendly.  I tip my hat to Costco for taking care of their employees - I know they pay more than the average store, give good benefits, etc.   And still, somehow, they make money.  Sounds like a win-win-win for all of us.  We need more of that in this world.  I REALLY love the fruit here.  I have no idea how they do it, but they get the "good stuff".  Their raspberries, while being super cheap, are also the biggest and best berries you can get.  Each berry is better than the junk I get in town for twice the price.  The strawberries are consistently good as well.  On weekends, you can have lunch just by cruising the sample stations.  Oh, and those stations work - I often end up buyin' what they're sellin'!  The kiddos also like to try stuff there (yay).  Need a quick lunch?  For around $2 you can get a slice of pizza and a soda (with refill).  Boom!  The Costco gas station used to be a deal on gas, but has since come even with all the other places around them.  Not sure why, but no special reason to stop there anymore (unless you have the executive membership and get cash back).  I won't go to Sam's.  I WILL go to Costco.
