5 Amazing clothing boutique downtown LV. Customer service is exceptional. You cant cash your checks, but you can surely spend them!
5 absolutely love this place.  Great fashion options (which Vegas SORELY needs) met Hannibal, the owner's brother and he is so chill!!  They encourage you to come in and just try on!!!!  Or even just hang out!!!  So easy to find a complete outfit, everything compliments each other as if you were in a stylist studio.  Will continue to come!!
5 Las Vegas is certainly not short on selection when it comes to shopping but get yourself out of the malls and casinos (and the malls IN casinos) and come downtown to Coterie if you want a well-edited collection of clothes for men and women that you won't find anywhere else in the 702.  I went with three (two men, one woman) friends and everyone found something. I scouted out two tops and one skirt all deeply discounted on the sale rack in back. I also saw a sage and leather etched mini dress from 12th St by Cynthia Vincent on sale and wished it fit me!  Coterie closed whilst I was still in the dressing room and I didn't detect a whiff of annoyance from anyone working here. They kept the music going and made jokes while ringing up purchases. Some members of my party may have also been loud and rowdy and the staff handled these shenanigans with aplomb.  I'm definitely coming back to Coterie.
