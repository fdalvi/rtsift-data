4 Love the service and quality!! Amazing work they will give you whatever you want!
5 I can't believe no one has reviewed this place yet! It's set back in a strip mall and looks a little sketchy from the outside, but the inside is clean and really beautifully decorated. I came here for a pedicure because it's close to my house and I wasn't disappointed. Really good prices ($23 for a standard pedicure) and the leg/foot massage was awesome! That's most of the reason I get a pedicure anyway :) I would recommend this place for sure.
5 I had a standard pedi. The cost is great and affordable. The service was awesome. I'd recommend calling for a appointment because this place is always busy. The service was great and the staff was super friendly. I'll definitely be back.
