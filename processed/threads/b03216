1 Absolutely the worst mani/pedi place in town.  The owner was extremely rude.  They continuously spoke in Vietnamese, and they were obviously speaking poorly of their customers.  VERY unsanitary!  I will NOT EVER go back.  Poor service and very disappointed with my mani/pedi.
1 Don't go here if you care about customer service.  They are rude and only want your money.  I've gone here a few times and I've left here feeling disappointed.  I was getting my nails done when the tech just started breezing through, I've noticed this before.  They rush their work if they have some one waiting.  They only care about quantity and not quality.  Nails are expensive so take your money somewhere else.
1 Horrible customer service , they are either not payig attention and rush or talking on their cell phones while doing your nails !! There are way better nail shops close by who actually care about the customer.
