1 Stay away unless you have all the time & money in the world!! After over three weeks and numerous excuses, and unreturned phone calls my estimate arrived only to be incomplete, incorrect & missing the sketch that was promised. All of the above was coming direct from the owner; I can only imagine how incompetent the staff is if this is how the leadership acts.
5 We have been using The Lawn patrol for the monthly maintenance of our personal residence for over 6 years and our lawn is one of the greenest lawns in the neighborhood.  They actually do more than just cut the grass like some lawn service companies do.  The employees are always very friendly and the owner is AMAZING.    When we wanted to do some major landscape changes she was very knowledgable in what plants and trees would work best to achieve what we wanted.  The price was very reasonable and she gave us a few options.
1 I made an appointment for someone to come out and give me an estimate.  Waited for over an hour for them to show, then called numerous times.  Never showed, never called back.  At this point, my experience coincides with Joe P. much more so than Ella W.
