5 This is one of the cleanest, nicest studios I have ever seen. The people are very friendly and helpful. The artist are the best in town. Could not say enough good things about this place.
5 This shop is awesome!! The entire staff is so friendly and helpful. I've been going to Liz for two years now and I have never been disappointed with any of the work she has done for me. She's a very talented and professional artist and her work is truly amazing. I also had a nasal piercing done by Kendra and I must say it was absolutely painless. I was very impressed.  She did such a great job!!
5 Liz does beautiful, elegant tattoos. I would highly recommend her to any 40-something soccer mom searching for her first piece of permanent body art.
5 Very clean studio with friendly staff. Their piercer, Kendra, was very professional and gave thorough instructions to care for the new piercing.  She was very informative and sweet during the entire process.  Overall a great experience!
5 Awesome shop!  Liz is absolutely AMAZING.  She is so awesome. I love every one of my tattoos from her!
1 may of been good in the past but current artist suck. missed 2 appointments for me. fight to get what i wanted with the artist who was obvious not wanting to do my tattoo. suppose to be designed when i got there it wasnt not prepared. spoke before hand what i wanted and then when i got there informed me he was out of pink. really. my 3-4 hour tattoo was told needed 2 sessions to finish. owner was rude defended artist and belive what i  said about his artist.
