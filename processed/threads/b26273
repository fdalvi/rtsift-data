3 BEST Value EATS in #Vegas!! @cicispizzavegas $3.99 All-You-Can-Eat Salad,Pizza and Pasta Buffet!!! Celebrating 25 years!!!  A GREAT place to take the kids-CHEAP $2.49 each and there's an arcade plus lots of open cafeteria type seating.  The place keeps the pizzas coming so every time you go up there's a whole new variety of pizzas to choose from. I tried spincah pizza, macaroni+cheese, Veggie,Hawaiian, Traditional meat+cheese. Pasta and breadsticks, salads and cinnamon rolls. plus they have SWEET TEA:)  I'm not gonna tell you this place has the best pizza or even good pizza but you can eat ALOT and the TEA is good and its CHEAP at under $5!!! Gie it a try and decide for yourself ;)
2 Had lunch here with friends on Tuesday. Food was okay. Good variety of pizzas but not great. But what can you expect for $5.99 ATCE? I was looking forward to the cinnamon rolls that everyone raved about but they sucked. Not fresh at all. Really disappointed!! The mac n cheese pizza was interesting. Don't think I'd go back. But for the money, it's alright. But ordering fresh from the people behind the counter is good, fresh decent tasting pizza! Overall clean and cheap, but foods not great.
3 People at my office drag me here once a week. Is the pizza awesome? No, but that isn't the point. It is a pizza buffet...a dream come true. Now if they would just add an ice cream buffet! They recently started doing a sort of apple strudel pizza for desert. Almost as good as an ice cream buffet...almost.
3 Good value.  Buffalo chicken pizza is amazing when fresh (but there's better).  And that's it. I liked it the first two times but after that it got kind of lame.
3 You can literally go all the way to value town here with the lunch buffet for $5.49. I had at least 10+ pizza slices today along with pasta and salad. One of the more "interesting" pizza slices there was the macaroni & cheese. It tastes basically what it sounds like. =)  I found the majority of the pizza slices to be at least okay. The pasta did leave a lot to be desired though.
3 What can you say. All you can eat pizza buffett for under 6 dollars.  They do have the most excellent buffalo chicken pizza. It brings to mind the joke. Sex is like pizza, when its good its great. When its bad its still pretty good.
2 I don't know what all the fuss is about CiCi's pizza?  Finally gave it a shot and wished that I had not given it a second thought.  It's not even that cheap, if you consider the total after drinks are added.  The quality is just not there of course. Not going to find anything gourmet in their AYCE buffet.  I guess I am one that prefers quality over quantity.  The $18 bucks or so we spent for two was not worth it by any means.  I am not a fan of cheese covered cardboard which is their version of pizza.  Oh well I tried it, now I know what it is all about.  Life will go on without ever consuming their cardboard cuisine again.  Enough said...
1 Back when I was living in Cali, I would occasionally see commercials for Cici's Pizza and thought, "this looks delicious. Wish I could go here."  Now that I've moved to a state that has Cici's all around town I thought, "finally."  UNTIL....I came here and tried this place for myself. Perhaps I came when they were 2 hours into closing time but their pizzas are NOT fresh. Even though it came straight out of the oven, it tasted like cardboard. I was disappointed. =( And the pasta...don't even bother. Very unflavorful and their sauce didn't taste fresh either.   Even though it was about $5-6 per person (not including beverage), I WILL NOT BE BACK.
1 Ehh...
3 Yelp 100 Challenge * 63/100  Not too big a fan of pizza buffets but this place is one of nostalgic value to me and one of my good friends. Plus, $5 for a buffet isn't bad at all. Since she's leaving Vegas away for good, we thought it'd be great to give this place a go for old time's sake.   My favorite was the pork with tangy barbeque sauce and shredded cheese pizza. It was probably the most sought after too, because whenever I went for a round of it, a new serving was placed - hot from the oven. That and the spinach with creamy alfredo pizza. For dessert, my friend and I munched on a few brownies and called it a day.
2 You get what you pay for. When it only cost $5.99 don't expect gourmet.  This wasn't my 1st, 2nd, or 3rd choice, it was the BFs pick. He can't resist pizza. He can't even resist frozen pizza. So the big PIZZA sign got him. It's not terrible for $6. It was pretty much what you'd expect. It has a tiny salad bar, soup from a can, pasta, a bunch of so-so pizzas, dessert pizza and YUMMY cinnamon rolls.  As part of your $6 they will make you a custom pizza. I say order a custom pizza that way you know it's fresh, grab a little salad and a cinnamon roll.
1 Ketchup on Dough! They basically serve cooked dough with what they call sauce and very little of it! The soup was eatable but cold! The sauce for the pasta, well I had better using Ragu out of the bottle (nasty!) To top it off I was overcharged by a very arrogant nasty cashier/manager! I wrote directly to them twice trying to resolve the problem with this nasty manager and got no results! I will definitely NOT be going back there! Their are way to many places to eat that have much better food and treat you a lot nicer!
1 Don't eat anything that didn't JUST come out of the oven. The pizza on the counter is truly horrible, but right out of the oven is fair to middlin.
3 So just like: SONICS, DAIRY QUEEN and GOLDEN CORRAL... living in Los Angeles, for years I've been subjected to commercials about CICI'S PIZZA (endless pizza buffet) ...even though there are NONE in L.A. Finally saw one in Vegas and had to go.  ========= LOCATION =========  Not nearly as big as I envisioned in my head. Their website listed 24 varieties of pizza so I imagines a looooong buffet line. Nope. There's like 10 pizzas out and every 10 mins they rotate new ones in and out. There's also desserts, salad and pasta on the buffet.   ========= THE FOOD =========  ~ MAC 'N CHEESE PIZZA - The best item on the menu. Your basic pizza slice with with Cheddar sauce on top instead of mozzarella. Mac n' Cheese atop... so bad for you but so good. (4/5)  ~ CINNAMON ROLLS - Decadently delicious homemade cinnamon rolls topped with icing. They weren't cinnabons but REALLY REALLY good nonetheless. (4/5)  ~ ALFREDO SPINACH PIZZA - A creamy alfredo sauced slice, topped with mozzarella spinach and herbs/seasoning on top. (4/5)  ~ CLASSIC CHICKEN PIZZA -  Diced chicken, fresh sliced mushrooms with zesty Parmesan ranch sauce topped with shredded Italian pizza cheese and Parmesan oregano seasoning on our traditional crust. (4/5)  ~ ZESTY VEGGIE - It's a veggie with WHITE sauce. Pretty good. Freshly sliced mushrooms, red onions, green peppers, diced tomatoes and black olives with our zesty Parmesan ranch sauce topped with shredded Italian pizza cheese and Parmesan oregano seasoning on our traditional crust. (4/5)  ~ BAVARIAN DESSERT PIZZA PIE - Really good. Rich Bavarian cream filling served with sweet crumb topping on our dessert pizza crust. (4/5)  ~ APPLE DESSERT PIZZA PIE - Surprisingly good as well. Warm cinnamon apples and sweet crumb topping drizzled with icing on our dessert pizza crust. (4/5)   ~ DEEP DISH PEPPERONI & JALAPENO - It was surprisingly decent. (3/5)  ~ BUFFALO CHICKEN PIZZA - Diced chicken, zesty Buffalo sauce topped with Italian pizza cheese and drizzled with Buffalo sauce for that extra kick on our traditional crust. Closer to a 2.5, it's hard to make a mediocre Buffalo Chicken pizza but they managed. (3/5)  ~ OLE - It was "supposed" to be like a taco, it's a big mess of whatever. Beef crumbles and fresh lettuce with spicy red sauce topped with shredded cheddar cheese on our traditional crust. (2/5)  ~ PEPPERONI - It was "whatever." (2/5)  ~ PASTA - It was pretty bad. (1/5)  ~ BREADSTICKS - They "looked" good but they were terrible. Waaaaay too salty. (1/5)   =================== THINGS I WANT TO TRY ===================  HOG FEST - Crisp bacon, Italian sausage, sliced ham and pepperoni with classic tomato sauce topped with shredded cheddar and pizza cheese on our traditional crust.  BBQ CHICKEN - Diced chicken, zesty Buffalo sauce topped with Italian pizza cheese and drizzled with Buffalo sauce for that extra kick on our traditional crust.  ZESTY HAM & CHEDDAR - Sliced ham and sharp cheddar cheese with our zesty Parmesan ranch sauce topped with shredded Italian pizza cheese on our traditional crust.  GARLIC ITALIANO - Diced tomatoes, sliced red onions and black olives, garlic butter sauce topped with Italian pizza cheese and garlic oregano parmesan seasoning on our thin and crisp Italiano crust.   =============== FINAL THOUGHTS ===============  There's a $5.00 all of July special going on which was awesome. All-in-all it's not the best BUT for $5 I can't complain. Some of the pizza was horrible, some was decent... a few items were good. Just googled... there is one in Ontario and one in Compton. I'll probably check out one of em soon.
2 Diarrhea city brehs.  So I swore to never eat here again. When I first moved to Vegas 3 years ago we came and ate here. I got a really upset stomach and was on the pot for quite a while after. Fast forward a year and I go to the one that used to be opened on Charleston and Durango; everything was fine, that place closed so now we go to the one on Cheyenne. Never had any problems with those 2 locations, but here, hell no.   The customer service is really great and the place is not too gross, but its def huge!   If you are constipated and need to release the demons, COME HERE!  YAY?
3 I just seen a girl(teenager) walk over to the dessert line, scoops up a piece of brownie & instead of putting the brownie in a plate like you supposed to NO she grabs it right off the spatula with her nasty bacterial hand!! That's disgusting & I'm sure one of the employees seen that..TERRIBLE MAINTENANCE!!!
5 Always happy to be back at Cici's. My son loves the cinnamon buns and the brownies..Also the pizza slices are good for kids too.
1 All i can say is i wont be going back to this location .... the worker was makeing sexual comments and i didnt even want to go back up to the buffet so we just left ..... i will be tring another location in the future !!!!!
3 It's not amazing pizza by any means. But it's all you can eat! The workers are really good about keeping lots of different kinds of pizza available and they'll make custom pizza for you. The cinnamon rolls and brownies are really good and I like their Alfredo sauce too.
5 This place is great for families and large groups. Also great place for quick eats for lunch or dinner  They always have a variety of pizza on the buffet but if you do not see your favorite pizza they will make it for you.  The employees are always friendly and helpful at this location.
5 Always a treat to come into a family friendly restaurant.  The pizza being buffet style is always hot and fresh, and the staff is always friendly and helpful! We are here at least once a week!! Specialty pizzas like mac n cheese, spinach alfredo,  all available for me being a vegetarian is spectacular.  They also have large party style tables set up in back and an arcade for the kids!!!
5 This place is not bad for the price. A group of 20 friends and I ate here and they were on top of their pizzas. What's cool as well is that if you want a pizza that is not on the table you can request and order one.   Eat all you can eat pizza for $7ish (lunch) with a soda. What else can you ask for?
3 This is an all you can eat pizza buffet. I mean come on. What more could you ask for. This location wasn't the best which is why only the 3 stars. They didn't have as big of a buffet as others have and some of the things looked like they had been there for a bit but they started bringing fresh stuff out and it started to be okay. The staff was really friendly as well.
5 Great food for a great price!! Everything was fresh and delicious. They have a decent variety of pizza choices. Will definitely come back again!
