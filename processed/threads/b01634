5 I've received great service every time I use their drive through, which makes getting my clothes less of a chore.  I believe they have coupons inside the location, and some on their website as well to save a little $.
1 I dropped off a brand new pair of slacks to be cleaned and pressed.  When I picked them up, one of the hooks on the front flap had been torn off and the flap was ripped beyond repair.  I brought the pants back the next day they apologized and then denied responsibility.  They said, "how do we know you didn't bring them to us that way or that it happened after you picked the pants up".  Never, ever go there.
1 After 14 years of taking my clothing here I am starting to notice a trend that's brought much unhappiness.  For the past few months, Pat's on greenway and Tatum have ruined a few articles of clothing. The first was a new white shirt that had come back with black grease all over the bottom of the shirt. Its the kind of grease that looks like the stuff you would use on a machine to lube the working parts. The second garment was a Tommy Bahama silk shirt. Again with the grease, but this time large bleach spots all over  the back. Lastly, a few if my wife's dresses... bleach spots all over. I really wish this cleaner would figure out their issues or else I need to go somewhere else.
