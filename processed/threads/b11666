5 They were hired by our property manager to clean some spots on our new apartment. I mentioned how I really hate how dirty the stairs were. He offered to clean it for me for free even though he's only getting paid to fix the spots. It was so kind of him. He did an awesome job. My feet used to get so dirty just from walking up and down the stairs. I'm happier with their service than the carpet cleaning company I actually hired to clean my previous apartment. If I ever need to clean the carpet in my car, I would definitely call Joe. They do other services, and they give free estimates.
5 Amazing quality service.  I had them do my rental property and they did a fantastic job.  I also had them do my two rooms in my home and they were great in getting all the dirt an stains out.  There pricing was perfect!
4 Carpets still wet, but it looks great so far!
