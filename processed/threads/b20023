3 Good old Greggs, the food here can taste like the best lunchtime meal ever if you're in the mood for it, or it can just taste like cardboard. I think everyone has a love/hate relationships with Greggs.   This is one of two in Rose Street and when I did the search on Yelp it came up with 1 or 31 Greggs in the area so they really are everywhere.  I guess for convenience Greggs is always going to be a winner, their sausage rolls and oval bites are my favourites and I'm rather partial to a chicken bake now and again even though it's innards look like regurgitated cat food. Yum.
3 Greggs is a good solid place to come for lunch and you know what you can expect from it, so there's no risks from coming here. They are as Eleanor says dotted all around town, so there's really no escaping from them when you are out and about.   This particular outlet does get pretty busy during the afternoon as hungry shoppers and hungry workers are drawn here for a tasty bite to eat. They do some pretty good baguettes that are freshly made there , and if you get a packet of crisps and a drink, you can qualify for their Â£3 Meal Deal. There are loads of  pastries and cakes., my favourite has got to be their sausage rolls which are decently priced at 58p.
3 I've never been a great fan of Gregg's they seem to be taking over the high street where ever you go.  I don't think a lot of baking goes on in these stored these days just defrost and serve unless you count the pie section, defrost, bake, serve. When I've come to this store on a Sunday there only seems to be two staff members working, one making the sandwiches and the other serving and taking payment. I find the juices expensive here but what l do like is consistency, no matter where you go you will get the same standard no matter what store you go to.
