5 I took my classic 1987 Mercedes 420SEL into Colors on the Run/Elwood Body Works for a bumper repair/respray and some minor body work on some dents/dings and deep scratches.  The work was excellent and performed on time and without any surprises.  The shop is spotless and modern, which is a key sign I look for when evaluating an auto repair vendor.  The service was courteous, knowledgeable and professional.  I felt like they took a personal interest in fixing my car.  Great job.  I will definitely use them again for any future body work I need and recommend them highly based on my personal experience.
5 These guys were fantastic in restoring some major damage on my recently acquired Infinite . The body work and paint was perfect, shined like polished glass. Both my wife and I am completely satisfied  and happy with our 'new' 2008  Infinite G36x We would definitely recommend them  to anyone who wants courteous, professional and detailed work. We will definitely use them again . Thanks again for the great work!
5 Had my rear bumper caved in on my 2012 Ford Fusion. Used Tom Mortensen and his brother of "Colors On The Run" to repair it. They came right to my garage and did an unbelievably FANTASTIC job!! They repaired the caved in bumper and painted it and it looks as though they put a brand new bumper on it! Can`t rave about these guys and the job they did enough!
