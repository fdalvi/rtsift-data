4 Ah, the smell of books, so comforting and homey. Bent Cover is large and filled wall to wall, floor to ceiling with great reading material. Way too easy to spend hours shopping here, checking out their massive selection. My hubby loves the huge sci-fi selection. I like the graphic novels, but the selection is minimal.   Bent Cover offers a great trade in or cash program. They also have a very small coffee bar with decent brew and a small rare book selection at the front. Staff is always friendly and informed.
4 It's mostly a paperback exchange. Seems like a fun and friendly place if you like to read a lot and trade in your books.  It's also one of those bookstores that never throws anything away. They've got 70s textbooks (for set dressing?). They've got trashy romance novels. They've got old childrens' book series. The place is crammed, but there's enough recent stock that it doesn't acquire that decrepit air.
4 Looking for an out-of-the-way place for a quiet mocha or a peaceful little get-together with friends?  There's a little known coffee house right here, tucked back in the corner of this popular used bookstore!  They serve a variety of soft drinks & light snacks in this cute, cozy little place, & also host various get-togethers & live entertainment from time to time.  It's nice!
4 A great place to get lost in books. The selection and prices impressed me. I can't wait to return and try their coffee shop.
5 I went back and tried the coffee shop - wonderful! Excellent quality, prices, and service :)
