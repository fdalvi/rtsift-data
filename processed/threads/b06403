5 I love the asiago ranch chicken sandwich with a spicy chicken. The bun was fresh and the chicken tasted like it had just been made. The salads are fresh and un-wilted. The employees are helpful and smile. I like this location a lot.
2 There was no one in line before or after us and we only ordered one thing, yet the lady still managed to be a bit rude and dump our fries upside down in the drive thru bag. How hard would it have been to not mess up? Just yucky.
1 Wendy's has gone waaaay down hill.  Ever sunce they changed the menu to sweet pickles, frys and red onions its hard to enjoy a meal here. Wendys change the menu back!!!!!
4 Fast service, whether you're inside or in the drive thru. Once I order, I usually have my food in less than 3 min. Food is always fresh and doesn't seem like it's been sitting, like other fast food places.
2 Sometimes I just need a French fries and frosty fix. But most of the time, this is a good chain to hit up for chili for lunch. Or their portabella melt, that was actually surprisingly delish.  But this location, man. I ordered one of their over-priced fancy entrée salads, and the portion was more of a side salad than an entrée but still set me back like $5. A little ridiculous considering they don't offer hardly any other "healthy" options on their menu.  Luckily I'd added on several dollar-menu options for the BF, so I wasn't totally screwed out of a meal. But this is pretty much cementing my decision to steer clear of fast food places- or to just resort to this place for the chili in emergency lunch situations.
