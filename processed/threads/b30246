5 I did some remodeling in my condo and had Scott and his team replace about 10 sheets of drywall then foat all the surfaces "Santa Fe" smooth. The quality of workmanship is Amazing, I would highly recomend them.
5 I had a leak from my roof that caused my bathroom ceiling to cave in. Scott was able to replace the drywall and had it paint ready in one day!  Cleaned up after himself and did a great job for a decent price!  Thanks Scott!
5 Scott was great. It was easy to schedule an appointment and he showed up on time. I had a hole in my ceiling from an upstairs water leak. The repair was done quickly and it looked great. He even did it for cheaper than what I was quoted by someone else. He is very professional and made sure to clean up after himself. I would highly recomend and I will definitely call 1st Choice for any future drywall repair.
5 Scott recently fixed a number of cracks in our condo ceilings. We were extremely impressed with how quickly he scheduled us, and with the excellent job he did. Bonus- his rate was extremely reasonable too!  I would  highly recommend Scott and will call him again should the need arise.
5 Scott just finished three days on my laundry room, and, wow! He did an amazing job. My handyman and painter came over today to start the second round, and they were impressed with Scott's work, and they have seen their share of projects. Scott removed painted over popcorn ceilings, and skimmed the remaining walls. They look fabulous, and are now ready to paint. Scott is communicative and shows up when he says he does. I recommend Scott and his company, 1st Drywall, for any projects you're needing drywall installation or repair to. Thanks much, Scott, and my popcorn-free ceiling thanks you, too.
5 Scott did an amazing job in my drywall repair.  I had a water damage and he cut out the ruined drywall and fixed it up like new. Cleaned up the area well afterwards too.  Very professional, got in, got out, job done.  Fair price.  Highly recommended.
