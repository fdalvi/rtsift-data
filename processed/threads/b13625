5 Can't go wrong with Starbucks. They make your drink till they get it right.
5 This Starbucks is clean. The employees are friendly. The manager Janora is fantastic! I liked it so much here I wanted to work here and got hired!

5 Went here to fill up our SHINEY new Starbucks tumblers with fresh Christmas drinks! I could not believe how busy it was!! The staff handled the massive amount of people with Speed, accuracy and a smile to boot!! Stephanie did an awesome job navigating my SIX confusing drink orders! A big thank to the Starbucks crew for such a great job under such pressure on Christmas Day !!!!
1 Has to be the absolute slowest Starbucks I've ever been to... One lady goes back and forth like she can't think of what to do next... They carry on personal conversations instead of focusing on getting drinks out... Watching people standing in line and looking at their faces looks like a bunch of zombies...but what can you do when their isn't another one to go to??
