5 I highly recommend using this company! Vegas has an infinite amount of choices when it comes to air conditioning /heating services; however,  not many will leave you satisfied. The technician that came out was knowledgeable,  professional,  well spoken and fixed the problem.  Oh, did I forget to mention I still have my arm and my leg!? Very affordable pricing!
5 This company serviced my ac unit today yayyyy Thanks Richard and his trainee I think Steve? great professional techs came in did the job and left. Did not ask to check out our bathroom or have a drink. In which I offer cold water all the time hey we live in the desert and they are working their butts off. But on the real give these guys a call. Thanks again Air Squad
1 I give them no stars these guys are thieves ..... They sold us a used unit they gave us 1yr warranty the unit broke in like a month tried  to contact them many of times no answer we even left voice mails and nothing ...so we ended up going somewhere elese .... Stay away from these guys
