4 Ok, a 7-11 is a 7-11. But when I grew up there was an video arcade machine in the 7-11s. Less one star for no streetfighter arcade game.  Besides that nothing crazy or new about 7-11s. They have drinks, snacks, and misc grocery stuff. I always thought that 7-11s were convenience stores without the gas station. Well I've been proven wrong about that now since there are 7-11 gas stations... Who would have thunk it!?
3 Its a 7-11 has the basic amenities that most convenience stores have but its tucked into a strip mall parking lot and is facing away from the street making it a hard loop around a back side street to get in from one side and a short back track if you use the other direction.  The store has always been clean and the employees friendly.   I've stopped in for a Slurpee after visiting my dry cleaners and will continue to do so as long as the temp is triple digits.
5 I love Slurpee's .. what can I say?
