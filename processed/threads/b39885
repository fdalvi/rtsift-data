5 Big W is the clearance outlet for all the Woolworths in the area. You can pick up real bargains here. I once got genuine Dolce and Gabbana sunglasses here for 8 quid. They stock loads of clothes, especially good value are the kids clothes. They still have Ladybird clothing, I remember when this was considered a designer label back in the sixties. The toy section is great value and they have a reasonable DVD section. Huge houseware section which has evverything from a tin opener to a chest of drawers. There is a Burger King which charges normal prices. Fab sweetie selection including a huge pick and mix bar. No pharmacy, it's now closed. The massive carpark is full of potholes so take care in the dark.    This store will close on 5th January 2009
