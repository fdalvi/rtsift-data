5 Come check out All Dolled Up Studio!
5 I love this salon.  Sally is always able to accomdate my scheulde and get me in.
5 Took my woman to Sally at All Dolled Up to cut off her 20"+ hair,color, and create a new short style for her. Sally is wicked cool, treated my woman like she was her sister and best friend! Sally has skills and experience that resulted in the best Salon appt my woman has ever had. She is going to be a regular!
5 Sally helped me in in doing two brides hair for a bridal photoshoot. She was wonderful to work with (their hair turned out amazing!) and the brides looked great for their pictures! Sally not only did their hair but also came with us on the photoshoot to make sure the brides hair looked great for all locations and photos! The brides were really happy with the outcome of their hair and Sally's work! Thank you Sally for a great day and for your wonderful talent you shared with us!
5 Sally is amazing! I have been to dozens of stylists who all did what they wanted with little regard to the various pictures and comments I provided as to what I wanted. I would leave always unhappy. That was not the case with Sally- she not only listened but met my expectations the first time and not with promises of giving me what I wanted months later- I can't express how pleased I am that I can finally stop searching!
