5 I brought my daughter to Dr. Nagy two years ago when she began complaining of feet pain. Dr. Nagy is you old style Dr. Doctor that gives you his full attention, listens to your concerns and takes the time to answer your questions. His amount of years gives shows on his thorough all assessment of his patients. I will recommend Dr. Nagy to everyone!! His staff office are helpful and very nice.
5 I have been needlessly suffering with foot pain for the past six months.  Dr Nagy was very thorough in his exam and his complete explanation of what was going on, physiologically.  He explained the treatment plan thoroughly, set my expectation appropriately and here I am, a couple of days into the treatment plan and I'm significantly better, ahead of schedule.  His office is efficient, clean, and pleasant and he is a delightful man who knows and takes pride in his trade.  He's a rarity among doctors these days.  I highly recommend him if you're having any issues whatsoever with your feet.
