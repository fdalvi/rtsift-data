5 I would highly recommend Sam and Wyman Mortuary. We looked at another one first but his family owned business was a much better value vs. the corporate run organizations. His personal attention to detail and prompt return phone calls eased our anxiety during the loss of my father. Prices are affordable. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Everything went smoothly and this is the only place we will be recommending for years to come.
5 We used Wyman's based on a recommendation. It was a good recommendation! The owner Ken Wyman was nothing like what you hear about in the funeral business. My Dad passed and Mom and he had discussed exactly what they had wanted years ago. When we went in she said what she wanted and he obliged us and did not try to up sell one bit. We even noticed from a previous experience elsewhere that his Burial Urns were substantially less expensive than we saw elsewhere several years ago. Accommodating and professional. They would get a sixth star if it were available. I'm pretty sure that you can't do better anywhere than Wyman's.
5 The staff was professional, kind and everything we hoped they would be. The Wyman staff showed compassion and utmost sensitivity, we did not feel pressured or taken advantage of. Their prices are clear, concise and without hidden fees. I felt that they were an honest company and their website clearly communicated their services and pricing.
