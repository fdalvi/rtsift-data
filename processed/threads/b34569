5 Ask for Lupi she is a great stylist. Has been cutting my hair since I moved to Vegas
5 Doesn't get any better. Ask for Allison. Go BEAVERS!
3 All in all, not too bad. It was a litte busy due to our poor planning, but the service was good and my daughter was pleased with the haircut. Other similar places are a little less expensive for the same service. Nothing was really outstanding, but there is also nothing to complain about either.
