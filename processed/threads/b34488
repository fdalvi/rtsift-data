5 The best!
5 Really good music school that kids can learn music & dance lessons.  The Teachers are very knowledgeable in their field.  Would highly recommend this school.
5 The Anderson Institute of Music  is a very unique and special place to take lessons.  The teachers are great hard working musicians, the staff is very friendly and care about their work, and the students are inspiring.  The school offers a lot of opportunities to the community and the students. I highly recommend checking this school out and trying out some lessons.
5 Situated in the heart of Buckeye, the Anderson Institute of Music & Performing Arts has by far the best music and performing arts instructors and equipment I have seen. I've been to several different music schools and performing arts academies.  It's been awhile since my last lesson from AIM but I recently had the opportunity to tour the new various studios and their different locations. What was very impressive were the diversity of the studios. For people who want a creative environment that instills self-confidence, self-esteem, and teamwork without sacrificing the core values of dance as an art form, the AIM studio is that place. The AIM studio nurtures students of all ages, provides, high-caliber dance instruction, and creates a family-friendly atmosphere using the mediums of dance, music, and performance.   As far as music is concerned, the instructors and staff are extremely friendly and helpful. My skills as a musician developed, as did my confidence, my abilities and taste in music. It wasn't long before I was able to not only understand the notes I've been playing but also read the music. I would have to say that deciphering the hidden messages in the music was like winning a secret war I never knew was there.   I hardly ever give a business 5 stars but being able to understand, and play music as well as I do now is truly a testament to the equipment and instruction i've been given. I hope that one day, AIM will be able to provide instructional videos (at a low cost) as I now live hundreds of miles away and lack the instruction that i've been given at AIM.
