2 During the first visit I was treated very well, the staff is very friendly and professional But on subsequent visits the doctor is very cold and if you have no money for treatments make you feel that there are no other options, recommend expensive treatments and offers no alternatives.
5 Most certainly the best dental work and staff. They make going to the dentist and getting a crown almost an enjoyable experience (let's be honest, it's still the dentist...).   The little touches help the experience - lip balm application mid-procedure, bottled water on arrival, superb magazine selection (but minimal waits mean you'll likely not get far), pillows, post visit calls to make sure everything has gone well.   Scheduling is also super easy. They've always been able to fit me in very last minute for whatever my needs are.   Bottom line: quality work, including cosmetic dentistry, in a nice modern setting with professional and friendly staff.
5 I work professionally with Dr. Snider and his staff. They are a wonderful group of people. I can tell how much they care about their patients and the quality work they provide. I would highly recommend this dental practice to anyone!.
5 I've had good experiences at this dental office. The staff is nice and the treatment was quick, painless and high quality. I'll be returning for regular checkups every 6 months. I'm glad my teeth are in good care here!
