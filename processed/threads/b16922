3 I enjoyed these courts very much so, and for being a pay by the hour set...  I was happy with the reasonable rates... The one thing I didnt enjoy was the not so friendly cashier in the club house who advised us without saying anything that we were interrupting his personal conversation.  i realize that the place was dead and you probably wanted to go home... but you are on the clock... and customers are in front of you.  Put on a fake smile AT LEAST and build a solid rapport with the customer..   Thank you.  Otherwise, spot on time.... lovely court quality.
5 This place, the instructors, and the players make me love tennis even more.  It's a great community to learn the game of tennis whether you are a beginner or a more advanced player.  The instructors, Marco and John are very supportive and are quite the characters on the court (that's a compliment).  They make learning FUN and funny.  Make sure to ask about their 30/30 special.  For $30 you can attend as many tennis classes for 30 days.  You will be hooked.
