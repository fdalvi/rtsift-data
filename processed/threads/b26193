4 Dr. Leslie Westfield is a great counselor. The only things I have to complain about is when she overloads her schedule and trys to cram everyone in at the same time. She is very sincere and passionate about helping people.
1 Dr. Westfield was a great counselor when she showed up. After 4 times of being a no show I said goodbye. How unproffessional not to show up because something happens ever heard of a phone call? My time is valuable and not to be wasted.
1 Wish there was a "no" star rating. This " so called"  professional doesn't show up!!! My niece is trying to get herself into regular therapy. She has been blown off in so many ways. Appointments set up. And, a no show from this therapist. No shows, regularly. Not sure how she made it to her regularly scheduled classes to pass her exams to be in this role. Geeeez
5 sometimes has trouble with appointments but i feel like that's a front office/secretary thing more. She is an amazing amazing psychologist. she's helped me with transgendered issues and helped me deal with my marriage as well.   amazing person, she's in it to help. not for the money.   i've never had a serious problem with no shows. all it took was a phonecall and reschedule. sometimes stuff happens.
