5 Came here as part the of the Phoenix First Friday walk and was really impressed with the space and quality of work. Located on the corner and next to Bikini Lounge and Trunk Space, it was a simple open space (at least when I was there). We walked into the bustling gallery and immediately started flipping through the pin-up photography books displayed on the table to the left when we walked in. My brother and I worked our way easily around the space, he was showing Travis Louie, Mark Elliot, and Brendan Danielsson at the time and I was impressed by how the artists tied into one another for an amusing time. After the artwork 'stops', there are display racks for books, zines, and local artists. More shelves display limited print small works of art, jewelry and other assorted goods. It loops to a large desk where the owner was easily chatting with attendees and he had lots of promos and goodies to take on the road. The crowd was diverse, esp. in age, and I felt super-comfortable here.   (Note: will post more and re-write after coming here a couple times, but I liked this place so much I wanted to get its name out there!)
5 Amy=the best. Doug=also the best. One of the many reasons why I stay in Phoenix. I've purchased art here and have been regularly impressed with the individuals they choose to show and represent. Utterly delightful.
5 Perihelion has done a lot in the way of bringing cutting edge out of town artists to Phoenix.  This really adds in such a positive way to the great art scene that Phoenix has.
