5 Fast friendly service. Ordered and programmed my mini van's keyfob quickly.  Highly recommend their services.
5 Our new office needed to be re-keyed. It's a ten year old building with many interior doors. Acme's service rep was punctual and had the work completed as promised. Very reasonable cost and excellent service. We will definitely use Acme Locksmith in the future.
5 I called around looking for good pricing on someone to reprogram a keyless entry and these guys quoted me a great price and were very friendly on the phone.  I came in and there was no wait time, the staff was knowledgeable and professional  and it was all very affordable!  I'll definitely be returning here for any other key needs I have.
5 Had great service and reasonable price.  Mike did my work and is good.  He arrived when he said and had a complete mobile shop to meet my lock needs.  He fixed an antique lock with a hard to find part and worked on about 4 other locks with great results
