4 Nice little cafe.... A good place for brunch and lunch... Afternoon tea too!
3 Coming to Scott's for lunch made for a great outing to South Queensferry. Armed with a Groupon voucher and expecting a ho-hum cafe in a nice location by the Firth of Forth bridges, we were pleasantly surprised to find this great place! The interior is modern and spacious with nice artwork on the walls. The food is reasonably priced with simple calzones for £3.95 and a whole afternoon tea for only £6.95. We had calzones and salad (which were fine for the price point) and had great mochas and a chocolate layer cake that looked amazing but definitely had a tad too much sugar in it. Scott's is a nice place and prices are good. It has a good location right on the main street but unfortunately doesn't have views of the Firth of Forth. It is definitely worth a stop in for afternoon tea, coffees, or ice cream and is perfect for a little outing.
3 A newer addition to the landscape of the Queensferry High Street, Scott's is a decent little lunch spot. Service is a bit lacking (tables didn't get bussed, orders were delivered in confusion, etc.). 4 of us popped in for a light lunch. Sandwiches and drinks all around. 1 drink order was brought out totally wrong, but the rest were right. Yummy sandwiches and while we didn't have ice cream, lots of people were enjoying it and it looked tasty. 2 stars for service, 3 stars for food. I'll give them the overall benefit of the doubt, though :)
3 I had a very nice lunch here, groupon deal including 2 courses plus a sundae. I feel like this place actually deserves 3.5 stars but since this was my first visit, I'll settle for an A-OK 3.  Scott's is a good sized cafe where they also sell ice cream and chocolates and you can even buy a painting or two if you wish!   Orders are placed at the counter and the food will then be brought to you. For starters I had a bowl of carrot, ginger and lime soup which was served with some bread on the side. It was tasty and  can't fault it really.  For main course I chose the 'Croque Italienne' which was served with granary bread, ham, mozzarella, sundried tomatoes and black olives. It was accompanied by a little side salad. It was delicious and I ate it all.  So, two courses down and one to go... At this point I was quite full so wasn't sure if it was a good idea to have a sundae as well. But, I rarely say no to dessert.. The waiter kindly advised that it was okay to swap the ice cream sundae for an affogato or a cake. I chose the affogato which was nice though I thought the espresso could have been more hotter, but it was still tasty.   All in all, a nice little cafe with good food and friendly staff.
