5 North Beach Italian Bistro is the new restaurant in Northwest Las Vegas serving traditional Italian food at moderate prices with outstanding service.  Owned by Ozzie Montano, who formerly owned and operated the North Beach Caf√© in Vegas many years ago, his new restaurant is a well addition to the dining scene in this area.  Have eaten there twice in past two weeks and have not been disappointed with the selection of dishes.   The walls are decorated with artwork by renowned artist Aldo Luongo is a similar fashion to his old restaurant.  I highly recommend this restaurant.
5 outstanding new Italian restaurant in NW vegas. The best restaurant in the area. Excellent service, food and nice atmosphere. The Caesar salad is one of the best, eggplant parm is fresh & wonderful and gnocchi with pesto is outstanding. Homemade desserts are fantastic. Ozzie the owner and the wait staff are very helpful and cordial.All foods are homemade, no frozen anything, every ingredient is fresh, no microwaves in this restaurant!
5 Great food, great service, good Italian restaurants are hard to come by in Nevada, everything we had was really good, will be back soon, thanks
5 Wonderful food!  Saw this place had great reviews, decided to give it a try and we were not disappointed.  The sea bass was excellent, the Linguine with clams was fresh and the clams were huge, not like the little things that are in so many other resturants linguine dishes.  The meatballs were fresh and my daughter loved them.   Definately give this place a try, well worth it and reasonably price.
4 Decent, had sea bass piccata style was good a bit salty, tiramisu was outstanding, service good. Wine list could be better need some moderate priced Italian Chianti & Tuscan. All pretty low end wines on list. Will come back to try some other dishes.
