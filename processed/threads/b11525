5 lots of interesting things in this store, good prices...
4 I love coming to this store to buy cheap kitchen utensils that I use for cooking.....sure grip, teflon utensils are my weapons of choice in the kitchen.  They have them here for decent prices.    Sometimes I buy stuff I use once because it's cool.....like an electric Deli Slicer.....that got used maybe 5 times and is sitting in a box in one of our kitchen cabinets.  Whatever, it's still a fun place to shop.  Will I return?  You bet.
4 OK, I admit to being a kitchen toy (tool!) junkie.  Probably the 5th or 6th time I have been in this store over the years.  I swear I was only going to window shop this time but I found an insulated drink mug that would fit in my console and not interfere with the parking brake lever that I could not pass up. :-)
4 Every time I come to the outlets, I have to come to this store! Even if I'm not buying anything, it's always fun to look at all the kitchen stuff. They have everything you need. From pots, to knives, to blenders, they have it all. I've bought a few things in the past. The prices are decent and the staff is always friendly. Although it is a little awkward when you are the only customer in the store and there's dead silence since there is no music playing.   P.S. I think all the mini kitchen stuff is so freaking cute! I want it all!!!!!!!! (Especially the mini bread loaf pan)
