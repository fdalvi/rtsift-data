5 My fave Grocery stores in Vegas! i'm reviewing markets today, so i'll say Albertsons is great. very clean, good service, nice people... the prices are a tiny bit on the high side, but i don't mind at all because its a classy store and conveniently located in just about every area of Vegas i've lived around... i totally prefer Albertsons over Smiths or Food-4-Less, though Food-4-Less has great prices - but not as clean. Yay Albertson's!!
2 This place is horrible.  There is no way to check out and I've been waiting for 15min. It's 12:30 am total BS  DO NOT SHOP AT THIS TIME.
4 When we work in town, and stay down the street at The Orleans, we usually shop here in the morning for lunch supplies.  Store is kept well stocked and very clean.  I like to shop Albertson's most anyplace I find one, it tends to be a store you can count on.
4 A good grocery store in Vegas. The place was very clean, they have a lot of selections in terms of everything, and the staff is friendly. However, it can be considered a bit on the pricier side.
4 Yesterday I went for a smog test for my car, spent about 10 minutes withs a lovely old guy, who as so bored ( I was his only client all day) he not to tell me the story of his life, no that was not that great, he learn his lessons a little to late, but I learn right in time that I can renew the registration of my car in less that two minutes!  I have no idea who deserves the credit, but what a great idea this was! A DMV kiosks right inside a very popular store!  Sorry I don't shop here, but I will see you again next year to renew my registration without waisting a day in line at DMV :)
4 Very good grocery store the people at this location are friendly it can be considered pricey but I always find what I am looking for and I love there fried chicken if I had that kind of money to shop here all the time this would be my go to store plus it doesn't hurt that there is a wells fargo inside so that is a plus.
