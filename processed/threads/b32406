5 I can't stop raving about this place and have no idea how there is not one single review for Love Empanadas.  Scroll over to the Fantastic Indoor Swapmeet at Decatur and Oakey (only on Fri-Sun 10am to 6pm)....You'll have to pay a dollar for admission but trust me, it's worth it.  Plus you can check out all other spots.  Head over to see Jorge and his amazing emapandas.  He serves chicken, fish, beef, and other specialties.  Each emapanda is 2-3 dollars and the crust is just perfect.  The fillings are individually crafted and has so much flavor.  There's a technique when you eat it.  Jorge will show you and is very enthusiastic.  You take the first bite of the crust and then he spoons some of his GOD-like chimichuri sauce inside so it seeps through the filling and as you bite through, you get all of the tasty goodness.  Jorge is so awesome.  You can tell he's really passionate about his craft.  I hope he gets more deserved attention.  I could really see him killing it at a Food Truck.  Someone with some skrill needs to invest in this man.  HIs emapandas are amazing and you'll feel better that you're supporting a class guy.   Don't walk....bike, drive, run your tail there now and check it out.
5 The food is amazing here! And, it doesn't hurt that George is actually from Argentina either. The empanadas come in three different flavors: chicken, beef, and fish. The pastry is perfectly flaky and the seasonings inside of the empanadas is delicious. The garlic chimichurri sauce is also very tasty. My dad also orders the Italian sausage, and while I've never tasted them, I doubt my dad would continually eat bad food. So if you are ever at the Indoor Swap Meet stop by George's booth for some awesome Argentinian food and interesting conversation with the owner!
5 Found this place by accident at the fantastic indoor swap meet. Now I can't get enough! I live across town and drive each weekend to enjoy the empanadas. Totally worth the drive, and George is always happy to serve you. Also try the most amazing chimichurri sauce!! If your looking for a great hidden food find, this is it!!!! I love, Love Empanadas!!
5 If you haven't tried George's empanadas, you're missing half of your life! Definitely the Empanada King of Las Vegas!
