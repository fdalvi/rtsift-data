5 Pink box doughnuts is a KILLING THE DOUGHNUT GAME!! far from the traditional doughnut shop! Every flavor is amazing.. I highly recomenned trying at least one dozen In your life
1 Pink box has great donuts but this location is unreliable. We went in on Sunday at 9am and were told they had no donuts that day. I'm not a donut expert but I imagine Sunday is a good day to make sure your stocked. Wasted our time driving there. Stock up kids!
5 I love pink box! But I wish they didn't run out of donuts so quickly. They definitely need to restock throughout the day.
1 I concur with Shilo, I just got back from heading that way and no one was there.   This location is unreliable, call ahead of time or just head to Summerlin.
2 For a while now I've heard of how amazing Pink Box Doughnuts are but if any of the other locations were like this one amazing would be a stretch. I've never been to those locations so I have to review my experience here.  This one's located inside of a Fabulous Freddy's Car Wash, Lube Shop and Convenience Store. The setup wasn't that great, you know how Krispy Kreme serves doughnuts at various gas stations and convenience stores its was more like that except with a larger counter and a live person. There were two small glass display cases on the front counter with one of each of the doughnuts they served. It was all for display though cause they'll grab the doughnuts from pans on the roll-in rack behind them. There's a couple tables and seats but they're shared with those waiting for their car's to be washed.  I had the Fat Elvis, it was a doughnut stuffed with peanut butter and topped with chocolate, a slice of banana, and I think brown sugar. It was enjoyable but not great. The rest of the selection go from the basic glazed and chocolates to more creative ones like a maple bacon bar, s'mores, almond joy, etc. I'd probably be back to try those but for now since it was both good and bad it's going to have to be OK at least until I try more.  This is more of a convenient spot for the people in the SW to get some Pink Box Doughnuts without the drive up north. You can order ahead of time via online or calling it. They range from $1-$1.75 a piece or $8.50-$12.50 a dozen. And they serve coffee too or grab something from the convenient store.
1 So we are so excited to have Pink Box so close to us! BUT this is the 2nd time we show up and it's closed. 1st time on a Saturday afternoon, which I get, but who wouldn't want a treat on a Saturday? So we went today, on a Sunday mid morning before 11am. Nothing! Closed! I called the summerlin location and was told they are sold out. They have them from 6a until they sell out. I get the donuts are good , but not willing to go at 6a to make sure I get a donut . Stock up guys, you are leaving money on the table and sending your customers to other shops. Dunkin here we come ! May not be gourmet, but they are open friendly and fully stocked! Reliable service vs no service ?!?
5 Good donuts and excellent employees working here.
5 I'm not a huge donut fan but I am a dessert fan and these donuts ARE dessert level treats.  These are not your typical dunk into coffee donuts.  These are dessert masterpieces which just happens to sit on a donut.  Faves:  S'mores, Boston Creme, Raspberry Filled, Lemon Curd.  I'm sure there are more flavors but by then I'm pretty much in a sugar coma and can't remember the rest of what I ate.  I just wanted to mention a few words about one of their most popular flavors, Date With A Pig, or something like that.  It's an unusual flavor combo and not one I would go back for.  Just bc you CAN do it, doesn't mean you SHOULD do it and in my opinion, this flavor combo shouldn't be done - blue cheese, bacon, dates, sliced almonds on a sugary cream stuffed donut.  Give it a try, just to satisfy your curiosity and then decide for yourself if you want a second one.
4 You guys know that I like a lot of my food to be original...which means I guess I may be a little boring when it comes to my palette. Anyways, Pink Box has been on my list to try. I finally made it down to this Durango location and they had almost everything except the Tutti Frutti. I don't think I've had a gourmet donut before so it was definitely a new experience.   There were two people ahead of me but the lady in charge was quite efficient. I ended up having extra time to ask her what were the most popular and well liked donuts since there was no one behind me. I ended up getting the strawberry shortcake (seasonal), NY chocolate cheesecake, maple bacon, green tea, Bavarian cream or is it boston cream and a plain old sugar donut. $8 for half a dozen...not too bad right?   I was starving so I got home and chowed down on the sugar donut with my tot. I'm not sure if I was just really hungry or if it was really good but I liked it a lot. The donut was moist on the inside and perfectly sugared coated on the outside. One of my friends came over and tried some of the other flavors. The green tea one didn't really taste like green tea but the Rice Krispies gave it a nice texture. The maple bacon or bacon maple? was a bit too sweet for my liking and I just didn't enjoy bacon with my donut. By that time I was in a sugar coma and I couldn't take another bite.   Overall, customer service was excellent. They do close up shop when they sell out and on the weekends the lady told me they sell out fast. I did like it a lot but some of their flavors I wouldn't be able to eat. I definitely will come back if I am in a donut mood.
5 Best donuts in Vegas! Tons of creative donut options. This store is a little less reliable than the Lake Mead location, but the products are just as good.
4 Got a dozen donuts but I couldn't try them all!  What I did get to try:  Maple Bacon, What-A- Joy, Campfire Smorez, Apple Fritter and raspberry filled is what I was able to try so far.   Maple Bacon is good, just like it sounds.  It has a maple top filling with bacon bits on top.  I didn't care for the top filling of the doughnut, but the bacon bits make it work.  Still wasn't bad, just wasn't my favorite out of the ones I tried. What-A- Joy, it's very chocolaty - which nothing is wrong with that just makes it all the better :). This was my co-worker's favorite. I believe this is made to mock the Almond Joy candy...well not mock but to mimic.  I don't like coconut usually but this surprisingly good.    I LOVE the smores...it tastes like smores.  It has a marshmallow filling that is soooo yummy, I had to dip some of the What-A-joy donuts in there because I like the filling.  Probably will get another one next time I stop by.   Apple Fritter- this was the least sweet out of the ones I tried.  Still good, I didn't taste chucks of apples or anything...I've never had this kind of donut before so wasn't sure how it's supposed to taste but it's a little sweet like some cinnamon but wasn't overwhelming. The Raspberry filled donuts is just like your regular filled donuts.  Looks like they use real preservatives though because I see the seeds in the filling of the donuts.  Yum.  It's sugar coated instead of glazed as some places make their jelly filled.    Definitely worth checking it out.  I tried mostly their Gourmet Doughnuts.  The two that weren't were the What-A-Joy and raspberry filled.    The location was in a gas station which I felt was a little old, but it works.  It seems clean..  There was only one staff member there, and she was very nice and helpful, suggesting some doughnuts to try as it was my first time there and giving me what people usual order and what her favorites were.    Overall great find, glad there is one near me and I don't have to drive to North area to try these!!
1 I'd love to try this plate but 3/3 times they've been closed or just sold out of doughnuts. Especially on Sunday mornings...what's up with that??
4 Every other post on my Facebook newsfeed yesterday was a picture of a box of donuts, celebrating #nationaldonutday. We woke up early today to go on a hot air balloon ride and decided to stop by Pinkbox on our way home to celebrate a day late. Usually we come too late, and they run out of donuts and close early. We were there around 8 and they were almost out!   My favorite donut is the Fat Elvis, because I love peanut butter. I got a dozen donuts and tried a tiny piece of each. That's the best way to keep your waistline from expanding and trying all the flavors at once. :)
4 During baseball season, we live at Desert Breeze Park which is across the street from this location. We come in from 'old' Henderson so sometimes the trek all the way across town at 6am to sit and wait around a baseball field leaves much to be desired. That is, until a cute little Pink Box Doughnuts sign caught my eye one early Saturday morning.  My daughter and I walked in and couldn't believe our eyes (and soon, we wouldn't be believing our taste buds either). Because we got there early, the assortment was plentiful, so we tried a dozen of their gourmet specialties. NONE of the dozen we sampled tasted bad. In fact, it was quite the opposite. A strawberry shortcake DOUGHNUT? our minds were confused but satisfied at the brilliant variations of famous dessert combinations being put  into doughnut/donut form.   Every time I plan to be in the area, I make sure to get there before 11am to assure that I'll have a choice of donuts/doughnuts. I can only imagine this smaller location gets bombarded, and with limited space, I imagine the doughnuts/donuts being swooped up pretty early in the day.   I've been there twice. Once on a busy Saturday, once during a slower Monday, around 11am. Both times, the same young woman was there. She was more than knowledgeable and friendly. She seems to thoroughly enjoy her donut slanging' job, and it was refreshing to get such excellent customer service.    Now, the question ISN'T about whether you prefer to spell it donut/doughnut, the question is when will YOU try this place?
5 Best donuts I've ever had! I'm so glad they  opened a store near me because I'd have to trek to the northwest to get my donut fix! My favorite so far is the s'more donut, but everything else is pretty amazeballs. It's sooooo worth it on cheat days!
1 7/8 times I go to this location it's closed. Went on a Thursday at 1030. Sign said be back in 15 mins.  I left at 1100.  Terrible business model.  I concur with all the other 1 star reviewers.
1 Their donuts might be amazing, but I'll never know. Not only is this place annoying to get to - it's inside of a car wash and there's no parking - it's NEVER open. I've tried twice now because it's so close to my house, but it's been a total waste of time both trips.
1 I tried one donut from their place at the town square location and when I found out that there was one located right by my house I had to stop by to try more! Well, unfortunately, I'm not the only who realize that they are closed half the time. They had no donuts out or anybody in the store! What a waste.
