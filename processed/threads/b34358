5 Great service!
5 Fantastic service, very helpful! I will continue to use them for all of my related needs!
5 No more vibrations in my Jeep at slow speeds or on the Freeway. Increased top speed and accelerates so smooth now! Any lifted vehicle most likely needs to stop here! Reasonable prices for custom jobs.
5 i had a custom one piece drive shaft mad for a project car that another driveshaft shop in Phoenix couldn't seem to get right. once it was finished it was amazing and reasonably priced for the work. not much later after having the custom one piece made i had to take it back to have it remade for a different transmission. they where very helpful with rebuilding it again and even gave me a discount for repeat customer..... i don't know if that was because i was just there 3 months before but who cares. they did an awesome job!
