5 Jim and his staff are top notch, honest, and reliable. If you don't take your car to them, you are just stupid.
5 Jim and company are great mechanics and good people, but most importantly they are HONEST! You can find competent mechanics most anywhere, but honesty is the rarest and most valuable thing you can find in auto repair! They get my complete and unreserved reccommendation!
5 Jim and his staff at United Car Care of Sun City will always  have my business. They are fair, reliable and have saved me from having unnessary work done that was recommended by another Sun City shop.
5 I'm so impressed and satisfied with the work and service of Jim and his staff that if I ever got stuck, I would rather pay got the towing service back to Jim's shop than let another person lay hands on my truck. Always personable and honest! 3 generations of our family are faithful to United because they are just that good!!
5 5 stars are not enough for Jm and his staff.    By far the very best mechanics  I've ever used.  Honest, reliable, pleasant  and they don't take advantage of little old ladies or anyone else for that matter.   I highly  recommend them unconditionally.
