5 Highline Import Auto is the place to go for your auto needs and more!!
5 I won't take my car anywhere else! Friendly, efficient staff, and prices work well with my budget. I highly recommend Highline Import Auto.
5 Helpful and friendly service ! Would come back again and recommend !
5 I agree with all the other reviews. Wes, the owner, is a honest business person focused on customer satisfaction.  We are new to the Phoenix area and besides trying to find a doctor and a dentist, a car mechanic is a tough search.  Well we are searching no more. Wes will be maintaining both of my vehicles here on out.
5 Highline Import Auto is the BEST! Quick and friendly service. My car was up and running in no time! Couldn't be happier. Will definitely be coming back here in the future! My 3 year old even knew how happy I was and said " You guys are the BEST fixers ever! Kids are honest and great judges of character. My daughter couldn't be more right.
5 Competitive price and quality work. It's the cleanest shop I have ever seen! Wes, the owner, is honest and very customer focused.  Took my 2000 Subaru in to replace the steering rack and, not only did I spend 15% compared to some of the competitors, but was completed in less than a day and my car feels like it did when it was new. 3 months have gone by with about 10,000 miles and no issues whatsoever.  These guys are great!
5 Wes was recommended to me by a friend who told me about the quality work his shop does. I called Wes and spoke to him about what I needed done to my Civic and he was incredibly helpful, even giving me an idea of what I had to look forward to without even seeing my car first. He was courteous, honest, and very easy to work with.  I took my car in and they took care of everything quickly, at a really great rate. He asked me to inspect everything before I left, willing to make any minor tweaks that I needed on the spot. I think he even vacuumed the interior of my car, because I don't remember it being so clean when i dropped it off...  All in all, I recommend him to anyone who's weary of getting ripped off by other places. He's the real deal, and I don't trust anyone else to do an equal job, let alone a better one. In fact, I am taking my car back to him next week for a couple other things i wasn't able to knock out on my first trip.   Thanks for all the help Wes!
5 I have an "odd" car- a 2011 Smart ForTwo-- so maintenance on this car is a bit of a challenge- as most people don't get how to turn the car on, let alone service it.  After absolutely being DONE with my dealership auto shop ($500 for an OIL CHANGE and basic tune-up?  I think NOT!)-- my husband and I decided to take our business elsewhere.  I use Yelp to check out most places before going, and I saw that Highline had great reviews, so I thought, "What the heck?  Can't be as bad as my dealership!"    Try- best auto shop I've EVER been to.  Honestly, as a woman, I think most mechanics are kinda sleezy and try to take advantage of the fact that I am a woman.  Not Wes or Highline.  They are the epitome of professional.  I've been there three times now, and I've never once felt like they were trying to pull the "wool over my eyes" or rip me off.  The prices are more than fair (especially since they regularly run the $75 for $100 certificates on Yelp), the service is fast (in fact, they can usually get me in the same day!), and they are so patient, honest, and kind (as I usually ask a thousand questions).    Bottom Line: In this life, you need a few people: a good hairstylist, a good banker, and a good mechanic.  Wes and Highline are literally the BEST in Arizona.  I cannot recommend them highly enough.
5 I went in for an oil change and to have my A/C serviced as it was not blowing cold. They told me that the hose was leaking and would need to be replaced. I asked about the compressor/condenser because Firestone previously told me those needed to be replaced, but I was told that they would start with just the hose. That could potentially save me hundreds of dollars. Good start. He also quoted me a worst-case scenario (replacing the compressor/condenser) price that was about $300 less than what I was quoted by Firestone. And he only charged me for the oil change! ($35, I believe.)  I took it in before class a couple days later and dropped by after class. I was told they did have to replace the compressor/condenser, but it would only take a little longer to do so. I waited in the shop, and they offered me access to their TV and WiFi. Wes told me he would help me out with the price. I ended up paying about $200 less than what he quoted me.  Everyone there was friendly, truthful, and helpful to me throughout the entire process. It was easily the best experience I've had with an auto mechanic to date.
5 Ladies....if you need to take your car in for whatever reason but are afraid of getting ripped off....go to Wes. High quality care, personable and honest. Great at what he does and is very meticulous with his work.  I highly recommend!
5 I really wish I found this place years ago, but glad I have now.   I had to change the rear brakes on my Honda but didn't want to go back to the dealer to have it done.  The Honda brakes are too soft for my model.  I did a quick search on yelp and found everyone gave Highline 5 stars over a long time period.  I figured I'll give 'em a shot. Couldn't be worse than the dealer, right? They are amazing!  The shop is super clean and all the staff is professional and courteous. Instead of tacking on unnecessary services, Wes and his crew are straight up and advised that they would double check the dealer recommendations before changing the brake and power steering fluids.  The cost of the job was fair and reasonable and they offered a $100 off promotion on yelp for $75.  My brakes are feeling great, ER brake adjusted and there's no squealing.  I definitely found permanent shop my Honda.  It has been a few weeks since they did my brakes and no issues.  I'm a very satisfied customer!!!
5 I took my car in because I had the check engine light on.  So I went Highline import auto and met Wes.  And right from the beginning I felt comfortable as I felt that Wes was very honest. Within five minutes of being there he took my car and diagnosed it and said it was the cam sensor.  He then replaced the sensor within a few hours of my next visit and I took my car home. Later that day that check engine light came back on. And since I've had so many bad experiences with mechanics I thought oh my gosh. But I called and I talked to Wes and he said no problem come on in and I'll take a look at it again.  He then realized that my car needs "two" cam sensors. So he ordered the other one and installed it for free!!! And on top of that he cleared out the gray fuzz that was on my headlights without even mentioning it!!! I'm super impressed by this place and Wes... I'm definitely going to come back.  I highly recommend it.
5 I took my BMW to the dealership for a door lock issue and they "found" other issues that needed immediate service. They quoted me over $4k for the repairs they recommended. I held off and only had the door locks done because a friend had recommended Highline Import Auto. I figured it couldn't be any worse. So I took it in and gave them the quote from the dealership. They ended up not having to do all those repairs as they inspected everything the dealership quoted and it turns out I only needed to replace the rear brakes and recharge the a/c, everything else was fine.  I was able to get a loaner car from them while my work was done, which only took 1/2 a day. I highly recommend you give Highline Import Auto a chance. Wes and his crew were friendly and professional. I ended up paying only a fraction of what the dealership quoted me for the actual repairs that I needed.
5 The team at Highline has been extremely helpful and honest. I've called in to schedule most appointments, but they've been able to get me in last minute numerous times too. Everything from basic oil changes, to brakes and a/c. You know your auto shop is trustworthy when you can start sending your family over there!
5 Wes and his company are awesome!!! Have a 2011 honda accord and brought it in after getting a quote from the honda dealership that to replace my ac condenser would be $850! Took it to Highline and got it repaired for 1/3 the price. Hands down best auto shop I've been to!!
1 I have replaced 2 CV axles on 2006 Honda Odyssey last only 4 months then had a leak I brought my van back for repair then told me it's loose on the clamp they will re tight the clam but, They never re tight on my 2006 Honda Odyssey. Never go back that place again. the worst auto service every see in AZ.
5 What a refreshing experience to have a mechanic that cares!! We have used highline many times  The price is always right and the service is top notch  I would highly recommend anyone to get a second opinion here  I had an AC replaced, brakes, many oil changes and a fuel pump replaced  Like I said their prices are right and they completed the job fast, they even had a loaner vehicle for me to use for my convenience
5 I took my Volvo in for a clunking sound thinking it might be an issue with the axles or brakes. Wes and his crew diagnosed the problem as worn-out engine mounts. They checked all the mounts and told me which ones needed to be replaced (all without charging me a cent). I ordered the parts and a timing belt replacement kit and went back a few days later. Long story short, the cost of replacing all the engine mounts and the timing belt was beyond excellent, and the work was of great quality. It's great to have my Volvo running tight and normal again. I'll be going back here for all my automotive work.
5 I took my Subaru (09 Forester) in thinking I needed a new steering pump. They tore down the old pump and replaced o-rings, fluid and belt. Good as new. Much less expensive than a new pump. Great service, fair price, nice people, and a loaner.
5 It is extremely difficult finding a honest, knowledgeable, reasonably priced mechanic. You will usually get one out of the three with most being dishonest, money hungry scavengers trying to fulfill a quota, IMO.  Highline has been and continues to be an awesome experience each time.  Strange for an Auto Shop right?  I was referred to Highline Auto by a fellow Officer after I shared how I went to Midas and was advised that they were unable to do my oil change because the oil pan or cap was damaged? Or they couldn't unscrew it? Confusing right? It should be noted I went in with a coupon for a $16.99 oil change.  I am now sure that this was the ticket to get me in the door, to be followed by a super duper up sale on items I didn't need.  Suffice to say, I then took my car to Wes, didn't mention what happened at Midas and he proceeded to change my oil without a hitch! That set the tone and I have been taking my car to Highline Auto ever since. Highline doesn't need coupons. Wes and his mechanics treat you fairly, are knowledgeable, honest and friendly. You just can't beat that in this day and age! Highly Recommended
5 Brakes were squeaking, so I found this place on Yelp with a lot of good reviews.  I figured it was worth a shot since it's close to home.  My first impression was how clean and organized the garage looked.  Kurt was very friendly, had my Honda Fit brought in relatively quickly, quoted us a reasonable price, told us it would be an 60-90 minutes, then offered a vehicle for us to borrow while the work was being done.  The waiting area isn't very large and they have a TV in there, so we took the vehicle and got some errands done while waiting.  We came back to get my car with the new brakes installed, used a Yelp deal to save some money, and not once was I offered an upsell on anything while I was there.  They did what I asked and were honest about what they would do and how long it would take.  I'll definitely be back.
5 I called Highline after seeing there great reviews on Yelp.  I spoke to Wes there and explained we were looking to purchase a used car near this company and were in a bit of a hurry to have it checked out as we needed to purchase the car soon.    We had heard a strange noise that sounded like it could be the transmission.  Wes said to bring it buy and they could listen to it to see if he felt there could be a problem.  We were to be there by 4:15 but my husband and daughter took a wrong exit and did not show up until nearly 4:45!  However Wes still took the car out for a drive and came back and let us know it sounded fine and he did not feel there was any issues with it and we still hope there isn't but at least he took time out even though they were closing to check it out for us! My husband said Wes was great to talk with and appreciated his time and help!  Thank you Wes and Highline Auto!
5 I love my car. I may not give it the love it deserves, but I truly love my car.  Recently I have had to do some maintenance repairs to it and having moved so much in the last 4 years has made it difficult to stick to one mechanic. Seems every time I find a go to guy I end up moving away. In the spirit of saving some money I went back to my hometown of Douglas, AZ to have some repairs done which I was quoted in Gilbert and were more than my wallet could shell out. Well, turns out "lo barato sale caro" (cheap ends up costing you more) and the shop in Douglas couldn't do all the services I needed, after I had already paid them the money to order the parts and waited 2 days to have my car fixed.   So I drove back to Gilbert somewhat defeated and wondering what I would do with those car parts in the trunk of my car. I looked online for a week or so and kept coming across reviews for Highline Import Auto. I was skeptical because most reviews were from yelpers that had few reviews and also almost everyone referred to the owner by name. There were a few reviews from established yelpers (at least 20 reviews in my book) and a couple of ELITES, so I decided to call them and give them a try. Here is why they deserve 5 stars:  They were able to get me in the same day I called and use the part I had previously purchased at the other shop. They knew exactly what I was there for the minute I walked in (no need to explain again) They called me within an hour to tell me what the car needed done, and not only that but they were able to tell me what was causing the problem and what needed to be done to avoid future problems. They had my car ready in reasonable time. The price was, in my opinion, fair. When I picked up the car, it looked cleaner than it did when I dropped it off, no grease stains on my door or even worse on my steering wheel and maybe they vacuumed it? The problem I was having has disappeared. The car is running great!  I would highly recommend these guys! I dealt mostly with an older gentleman who was very professional and helpful. I met the owner Wes when I went to pick up my car and he was very nice, so now I get why all the name dropping on other yelper's review.
5 The mechanics at Highline have gone out of their way to help us with our aging Volvo sedan. Their customer service can't be matched and although it is a bit of a drive for us, we totally trust their work. Couldn't be happier to have found them.
5 i have a old beat up 92 dodge dakota pick up truck, that i just cannot part with for some unforgiving reason. my old engine blew out on me and i have been searching high and low to find a honest mechanic to help me save my truck that i love so dearly, and to my demise i have been taken through the ringer with mechanics. as we all know shops love to take advantage and gouge people ESPECIALLY if your a woman. i am totally fed up with insincere and morally incorrect customer service. i am very serious about saving my truck and restoring life to it. i happen to stumble upon yelp and reviewed a few shops and for some reason i was totally  gravitated to highline import auto. i reviewed some of their yelp reviews and checked out their website. it took me a while to call but something kept nipping at me to give it a shot. and  to my surprise charlie was as sweet as pie.A very friendly atmosphere. and although my truck may need a little bit more work then anticipated. charlie was honest and sincere with his advice vs a professional decision to make more money.  due to charlie's amazing willingness to help and honest opinions he has earned the shop a new faithful customer. thank you charlie :)
