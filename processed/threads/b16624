5 Gas is expensive but where can you find cheap gas now a days. Great customer service with everyone that works there. Will talk and chat and if they know you they tend to know what you want. Great place.
5 If you're in the mood, the coffee brewed here isn't too bad!! Good selection of snacks, (Beef Jerky, Chips, Donuts, Candy.) If you like to play slots, they always offer you a drink or free snack. They have both Coke and Pepsi products for fountain drinks, which is nice! Personally, I've always had good service at this Speedee Mart location...
5 This has been my quick stop store for a number of years as it's right across the street from where I live.  It's always been quick and friendly.  A great corner store.
