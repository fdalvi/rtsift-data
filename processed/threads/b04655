5 My Acura hit 30K miles recently....could not believe the price the dealership was going to charge me for the recommended maintenance and service that was needed!  I had a friend who recently took their car in to AAMCO in Surprise and had good luck, so I thought I would see if AAMCO could get me a better price, on the same services.  They absolutely did!!!!  I left my car with them for the day and they took care of all my required maintenance and service for my Acura MDX at a fraction of the cost the dealership was going to charge me.  I was impressed with the customer service Ron the manager gave me and how I got in for an appt quickly.
1 This is the summary of my review: Can I give NO stars? Hubby's car was not blowing cold air so we printed an online coupon for Aamco to get an AC recharge. The Aamco people called after having the car half a day and said we needed a new compressor and new hoses for a total of about $1300. We declined the repairs and took the car to our real mechanic in Peoria. He told us our compressor is fine and all we needed was new hoses. $655 and a couple days later (after ordering parts) we had our car back. Thank you HANS for saving us almost $700. We'll never go to Aamco again, even for routine maintenance.
4 Great service, great prices & professional staff. Ask for Ron
