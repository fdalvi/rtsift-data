4 Great little shop and cafe. They do scrumptious toasted marshmallow milkshakes, just choose the  flavour youd like!. They  have beer marshmallows too! Nice for gifts too & not expensive.
4 Definitely should go and give them a try. Considering the work,thoughts and effort the owner had put into these lovely softies..  They are very airy fluffy and yummy. What real marshmallows should be. With characters also gluten free and low fat!! Not just any high street confectionary sweeties that's packed with chemicals and flavoring.   Got to love the earl grey and thr coconut ones...was hoping to get my hands on the key lime ones but they didnt have it today. .  Yes they are different from our usual marshmallows. .its a way higher standard but it is quite pricy...Â£3.+for 6 to 8 bits of marshmallows...  Other than thr price. .no complaints. . Worth giving a try.
5 Point the first: the shop is a working shop devoted to marshmallows and also stocking the finest in local artisan confectionery (Pinnies & Poppyseeds shortcake, Edward & Irwyn chocolate) - no longer any cafe element to it. Kitchen visible. Packaging stacked neatly on the shelves. Icing sugar tramped charmingly from till to window over the otherwise pristine shop floor. Point the second: it's vintage and cutesy without being kitsch or saccharine. The colours are very slightly brighter and more vibrant than the oh-so-trendy macaron/candyfloss shades you're seeing everywhere at the moment. Point the third: They have a framed picture of Mr StayPuft. Point the fourth: Sean, aka Mr Toontrait, the chirpy fun chappy who served me, seemed to be 100% in love with the shop and I could have stuck around chatting about marshmallows and his illustrations (he did the logo) for hours. Point the fifth: those marshmallows though. UNFFFFF. Uh. May. ZING.
5 I confess; I haven't visited the Marshmallow Lady. But I just had to write a review because I have tried her wonderful, dreamy sugar-puffs of heaven. All those other marshmallows you've had...Those aren't marshmallows! THESE are marshmallows. Believe me, you're going to want to buy packs for all your sweet-toothed friends just to see their faces when they taste these perfect light and fluffy squares and take a one-way ticket to sweet, sweet mallow heaven.   Thank you to Brown & Co delicatessen in Bridge of Allan for stocking such a delicious  product. Of course, I want to share the joy of these sweet heaven-sent bouncy mallow-pillows with everyone. But I also want to keep them all to myself. Such is the yum of the Marshmallow Lady's produce, and what a predicament to be in!  I want to try all the flavours and I want to visit the fine Lady herself.   Marshmallow Lady, I commend you. Keep working your mallow-magic and I'll forever be a fan!
