1 Just moved out after 8 months. Broke the lease which cost $2000 which was fine. The kick was, a couple weeks later they tried to charge over $4000. They had us pay for carpets and pay all the discounts back and then some. Living with loud kids always stomping around above us and having to park on the other side of the complex was enough to leave and invest in my own home. Settled payment with under $3500 but really? That was way more than the $2500 we expected to pay.   Note: Sure Deposit is a joke. It doesn't cover anything but they are sure to take your deposit. Plus pet rent is just wasted money because they will still charge for carpets when you leave.   Staff was friendly, but I don't extend that comment to corporate Mark-Taylor.   I don't recommend this apartment.
