5 I have used this company many times over the last three year's. The owner personally does the work himself.I have older carpets and a dog, when he leaves my carpets look new and smell fresh. I recommend this company highly.He's not the lowest priciest,but the quality of work is top notch.
5 Wow.. What a great job !!... A very very good job... Highly recommend! They were able to get all my stains out.. and the carpet was dry and good to use asap...will use over many times
5 They did a great job . Excellent carpet smells like new carpet ! Alfredo is so nice - he cleaned my rug top and bottom ! Very quick  ! Great customer service .
5 Alfredo has been taking care of my office and home for over 2 years and my carpets still look brand new. Always accessible and on time.  A+ in my book.
5 I called around town and no one could give me final price. They advertise $99 any for room and then final price for house $300-500 . Mr champion was able give price out door w/ no surprise . I call on Friday and Sunday he was on time. After our walk through he got equipment ready and I left the house to pick up my kids while he work. It took about 3hrs for 1360sq house not bad. The carpet look brand new after 6 years living there.
