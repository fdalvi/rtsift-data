5 This store is very well stocked and maintained as you can see by the pics I uploaded. The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable about the merchandise in the store. I asked an employee how much the pinatas were. She asked which one? I told her my son wanted the Angry Birds green pig and she said that one is $19.99 without having to go to the actual aisle. I like the fact they have the balloons behind the registers unlike other party city stores where they are usually located elsewhere and it causes more wait time for someone to help you. This store is the best.
5 I've been shopping at Party City for what seems like forever :) this is a very cool store, the go to not just for birthday parties, but pretty much any kind of party you can think of :) they've always got the best costumes and accessories for Halloween time and cute little dress up items for kid's parties :)
4 The place to go if you need supplies for any party or event.  They have everything from balloons, napkins, toys and party favors, to wedding supplies and costumes. They have everything well organized by events and themes.  If you want a Spider-Man or Disney princess themed party, they have everything you need.  WARNING...You may catch yourself playing with all the little party favor toys they have in bulk bins!
