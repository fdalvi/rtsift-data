5 Best Chiropractor ever!
5 I have been to several chiropractors over the years and, frankly, was never too impressed with their "move 'em in, move 'em out" mentality.  Dr. Mike Martin is SO far away from that; he really knows his stuff, combines massage with manipulation...I've NEVER walked away from here without feeling anything but amazing.  HIGHLY recommended, especially for those who have their doubts about chiropractors!
5 I would highly recommend this chiropractic practice to anyone. Michael Martin really listens to your areas of concerns and focuses on getting you in and getting you better, rather than making you come back again and again. You will never want to visit another chiropractor again after coming here.
5 I am a pretty big guy and have had bad luck with chiropractors in the past. Dr Martin made me a believer.  He's one of the few chiropractors who listen to your problem and doesn't just give you a generic pre- patterned treatment.  He knows how to manipulate to get the job done (not always easy to do on a guy my size)!  I always and will always recommend Driftwood Chiropractic to every body looking for a good chiropractor.
5 Can I seriously give this Dr. 10 stars please? He's awesome in every way. I was his last appointment of the day and he literally spent an hour and a half assessing my back and neck issues, and then treated them on the spot. He took so much time with me; I never felt rushed or hurried . . . I didn't leave his office until after 7:00 pm! I felt amazing when I left the office and will continue to see this Dr. until I am pain free!
