4 A really great, large, branch. A half dozen inside tellers, four outside drive-up tellers, a couple ATM's, one drive up, one walk-up, etc. They are unfailingly friendly and polite, always seem eager to help during each of my dozens of visits there. The ONLY reason they don't get that fifth star is because they wouldn't help me retrieve my ATM from the outside ATM.  They could have asked the Brinks folks to bring it in next time they emptied the machine, but just resisted and resisted. Caused me a huge financial hassle because I had a Wachovia account that hadn't been converted and it took me two weeks to get a new card, and I had to change lots of auto-payments.
5 This is my local branch, it just happens to be within walking distance of my house and it just happens to be awesome. Super clean and warm inside, staff that jump out of their skin to help you, a local business center, notary... everything you need in one location. I haven't had a single unpleasent interaction here.
5 I do a lot of banking here and I even had to make a stop at the branch on my wedding day in my gown! Long story.  But most of them have not forgotten me since.  When they took over Wachovia, I was quite unhappy because I had switched from "Broke of America" in order to do business with a smaller bank.  Though WF is fairly large, I still get that small bank feeling when I go there.
