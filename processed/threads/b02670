3 The manager was nice and people were happy to be making free DBacks tacos. It had a party - like atmosphere with happy customers and employees. Very clean and well kept. Good for a Taco  Bell.  I enjoy the somewhat healthier Fresco Tacos over the original.  I think the biggest difference is the lack of cheese and the addition of pico de gallo.
3 Tried the Cantina Burrito with chicken, man it was delicious! I usually don't frequent Taco Bell, but this was worth the time. The counter person was friendly. He saw that the sun was beating thru the window when I was eating my meal and offered to drop the blinds. I didn't even ask. Point for this Taco Bell!
1 So I came here last Saturday and tried the Cantina chicken burrito and loved it. I came here today and ordered the same thing, and seriously thought I was eating a veggie burrito there was hardly any chicken in it. Boo... not sure what gives
