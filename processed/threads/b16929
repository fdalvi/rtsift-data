4 In a city where there is a convenient store or coffee shop on every other corner this is the place I go for my morning Pick Me Up before work at least once a week. The Pick Me Up is not just the coffee caffeine fix. It's also Rocky, the cashier with a big smile wishing me a great day. He ALWAYS wishes me a great day. It's not part of his work script like other stores, either. He even knocks on the counter when he says it which I don't really understand, but still think it's cool.   The store is always clean. The coffee station is always complete with several hot coffees and the sugar free syrup is waiting for me. Also they have an assortment of sweeteners to choose from and creamers which come flavored and nondairy as well. The coffee bar just rocks and you can't beat the price. Don't EVEN get me started on the Mocha Iced Coffee which tastes just like the milk left in the bottom of the bowl from Coco Puffs and probably has 700 calories. No, I know absolutely nothing at all about that goodness.....  Overall it's a legit 7-Eleven and definitely deserves a shout out. They aren't doing rocket science here, but they are doin' their thang and doin' it right. I'm gonna keep comin' back.

3 This 7-11 is near my house along with another one one block away. Unfortunately this area if town isn't what it use to be so getting out if your car expect to be approached, hopefully only by somebody asking for spare change.  The other day I drove up and the lady that works there was outside shoeing away some guy, thanked her for that cause I wasn't in the mood. This 7-11 is really well tended too and I feel  more at ease going here than the one down the street  Keep up the good work I hope the owner pays these employees good cause there is more to their job than just being a cashier
