4 Nice people work here. The place is always clean and the gas is Shell.
5 Always friendly and clean
4 Stopped by to see if they have cash back option cuz I wanted to try out the Purple Penguin. When the attendant  told me no, I was about to walk out without service. But I queried that along with a 3rd degree which would have forced some on a smoke break, but she stood strong and entertained me for 10 minutes. So I bought something, just anything to show my appreciation. She may have been genuinely interested or just a good actor, but some regulars had a rapport with her so her politeness and smile was more than enough to establish my "go to place" for gas when I travel Horizon Ridge Pkwy.
3 Store is generally clean and the employees are nice enough.  I hate that gas is 5 cents more a gallon if you use debit instead of cash.  That is silly, most people don't carry much cash.  If it weren't for that it would be a 4 star.
