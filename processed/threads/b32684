1 Make sure that they are Open first! Stopped by the day before Thanksgiving, the day after, and the day after that. Had to buy the Chicken Parm sandwich as my third choice, since my first two options they were out of! Not sure how long in this world this place will be here, I wish them the best
1 I have literally never seen this place open and I live two blocks away.
1 Avoid if at all possible. Not worth your time, $, or caloric intake.
