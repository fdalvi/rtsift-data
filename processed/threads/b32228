5 I'm super happy to have Emerald in the neighborhood!    They have a full stock of pool chemicals & accessories at reasonable prices, a new construction/remodeling design center and a full service department.    We've been using Emerald to test our chemical levels (free) and make any necessary recommendations.  Every employee has been completely honest, expedient and extremely helpful without any of the annoying sales gimmicks you would expect from a pool supply store.    Sweet!
5 Super great staff with lots of knowledge that keeps my pool system working wonderful.  They have our parts, chemicals, toys, cleaning parts.  Have been coming to Elevate at least once a month for 12 months, every time has been five stars!
5 Great company, thanks for all your help. Larry
5 We're in the process of buying a house with a GREEN pool in the area (we live in CA at the moment). They came by last minute, and acid washed our pool, fixed it up for our inspection, and sent us pictures. The pool looks amazing now, and they totally helped us out in a bind! Everyone that works there is super friendly and helpful! :)
1 Poor service, stay away.  Too bad as the store does well with supply and advise.  The service department is a mess.  Basically was told to find another pool company after teriible communication and service.  Took weeks before they just told me to find another company.  Called a local guy and he had the problem fixed in 15 min.
