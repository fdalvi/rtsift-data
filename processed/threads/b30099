5 I started going to Desert Bronze when my other tanning salon shut their doors in the middle of the night.  Clare the owner of this salon made the transition easy.  And her shop is spotless well maintained bulbs are actually changed it looks to be on a regular basis.  They have my business....and highly recommend!
1 Do not get an airbrush tan here. It was very pricey...not very dark even though I made this request very clear....and it lasted about 3 days. I am sure their other services are wonderful but not airbrush tanning. Go elsewhere.
