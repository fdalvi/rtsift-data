1 Ordered Heartstrings arrangement for valentines, went to pick up. Person at front was yelling at phone to shut up, finally get service and the arrangement was all wrong (not Heartstrings arrangement), was charged double and didn't have everything advertised. They didn't tell me they didn't have the vase or things that went with it, didn't offer more flowers or return. Will never go back!!
1 I received flowers on Saturday from a friend to congratulate me on my new business. I sent him a picture of the flowers and he told me its not the one he ordered. My friend called the florist and told them that they delivered the wrong arrangements. The florist said they didn't have the one in stock he originally ordered  (the florist should have called him back to let him know).   The florist said they will delivered the correct one the following day. When the florist got to my home they wanted the original arrangements back. I had the flowers at the shop I just opened. Long story short I had to have them come back so I can exchange the arrangements. I'll never use this company.
1 NEVER. NEVER. NEVER. NEVER. we ordered birthday flowers and they never came on the day promised.called the next day spoke to Leeanne ( the owner ) three times the next day and she promised they would be delivered they NEVER came. Finally we called the fourth time and she refused to make it right so we asked for refund and she stated that she didn't have the 80 dollars to give us back.. what?? then the flowers were delivered two days late by accident but they came back to take them from us because we asked for a refund.. unprofessional and completely disastrous
