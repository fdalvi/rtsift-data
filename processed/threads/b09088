5 These guys did a radiator flush for me a few days ago - The manger was the one that helped me - he was fantastic!
5 I always go to this Jiffy Lube because the staff is always so helpful and friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for great people and great service.
5 I used to change my own oil before moving to Arizona. Now in this heat; Forget it. So I was a little leery about trying one of these quick lube places. Last time I tried one, they stripped my drain plug and I was forced to buy a new one. But to my pleasant surprise, these guys are awesome. Talk about A+ service.They  made everything easy to understand and DIDN'T try to upsell me things I didn't need. I highly recommend them on their service alone.
5 This the the best jiffy lube by far.  I was treated like I was at a 5 star resort.  They did not try too hard to over sell.  Will be back for sure. It's worth passing by two jiffy lubes that are closer to my home to come to this one.
