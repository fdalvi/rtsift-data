5 Just got my hair cut today and what a great experience. Charming building, Great cut at a terrific value. I got my hair cut a little shorter for the warmer weather and Patrick got it perfect. I was on a break from work and time was critical. I was in and out and most importantly got a shampoo after the cut so wouldn't have hair down my shirt! Saving the best for last...shoulder and back massage afterward, then on my way back to work much more relaxed. Top notch salon. I highly recommend it!
5 Love this place! I have been going to Kelsa for two years now and I won't go anywhere else! She even squeezes me in for a style  when she is booked!
1 Went to him twice. First time, I ignored the dirty comments and sexists remarks, thinking perhaps it was "something I did" to give him the wrong impression. Second time was enough!     If you go here and wonder if something is "off" with Patrick's demeanor and professional conduct, take it from me and trust your instincts!!!  Any professional who talks to you the way he does has no respect for himself, his family or his clients.   There are many other places to get your hair done in the valley.   Do not let someone disrespect you and don't disrespect yourself by putting up with crappy, sexist, perverted and down right dirty conversation that makes you uncomfortable.    I give it ZERO STARS. Sorry Patrick:(
