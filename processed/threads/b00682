5 Lebowitz Dental Associates serves the residents of Phoenix, Scottsdale, Paradise Valley, Mesa, Baltimore, Chandler and Arcadia. Some of our patients even drive from as far as Gilbert or Surprise to experience our most comfortable approach, modern technology and comprehensive, friendly, highly personalized care.
5 The staff and Dr are very friendly. The office is very comfortable and inviting. They explain the procedure, so there are no surprises. Didn't feel any anxiety. Great and wonderful experience!
5 My dentist is Dr. Michael Lebowitz and my dental hygienist is Debbie Ziton-West. I highly recommend them to all my friends and family for their excellent training, their professionalism and their all-around niceness!
5 My favorite dentist and team I've ever had. Have used them exclusively ever since we moved here 10 years ago. Even as we've changed health insurances, we stay with them because the experience is so good. Debbie is a wonderful hygienist -- friendly and thorough, and Dr. Lebowitz is terrific. They always explain what they are doing and why. Comfortable office and uber-friendly staff. Always on-time. I recommend them to everyone I know (and to anyone I don't).
