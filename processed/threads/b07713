5 This review is for 1 thing only.   The Frito Chili Wrap Jr  This thing was a buck, it was freaking good. I will be getting the larger one next time.
2 Went for lunch and wasn't impressed.  I had the double sonic burger with bacon.  The fries were just mediocre and the burger really wasn't anything impressive either.  The only thing that gave this review a second star was the Cherry Limeade.  Honestly a great drink too bad the food couldn't be on par.
5 Great service, fast, and friendly hops. Love the happy hour prices before 11am, and 2-4pm. Also their coupons are always a good way to save. I just reloaded a sonic card for $25 and got a free burger coupon!
3 When it is blazing hot in Phoenix, get a ice cold beverage which they have lots of.  One block away from the office I work in when I go to Phoenix so it is pretty sweet.
4 Drive up menu busted had to move car to another car port.  Food, however, awesome!  Also credit card machine broken car hop took transaction and unfortunately there are no free refills.  Their fountain drinks are so good and the crushed iced is just right.  Great spot for a quick bite to eat without getting out of your car.  I wish we had these in Los Angeles.
4 Clean, friendly staff.  They have never messed up an order for me.
5 Always have to go to sonic when in Arizona! The food is very cheap and good,however my favorite thing on the menu would have to be the fresh banana shake.
