4 I was planning on doing a little trout fishing in Oak Creek Canyon, and was in need of Powerbait. I was in a hurry, so I pretty much ran in and ran out, and didn't have much of a chance to check out the shop. My impression was that it was smallish, but had all the essentials, and was very neat and tidy.  I also remember that, with no prompting from me, the guy who directed me to the bait called a friend of his up in the Canyon to ask exactly what trout were biting on at the moment. Now that's customer service!
5 I work near here, so even though I live down the street from Bass Pro Shop, I still come here where they know their stuff! I can get better deals and find hard to find items.
5 A bass fishing mecca. More fun than a big box joint. No little annoying kids, no carnival atmosphere. You walk in and the dude behind the counter is a fellow bass fisherman, like you. If you are a local, or just visiting, swing by. You will find something you need!
5 Closed forever. Sorry, FC. Gonna miss ya! Support your local tackle shop.
