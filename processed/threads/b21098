5 I love Scoosh!  If the quirky exterior doesn't entice you in, then the colourful displays will. They have the coolest umbrella's in Edinburgh! I always get complimented on my scoosh brolly, I love it when it rains.  They do really nice small things, ideal for quirky stocking-fillers. They also have a specialist jeweler who makes really different bracelets and necklaces with odd bits and bobs, but were a bit pricey - about £30-£50 for a bracelet. They sell really cool cards - if I have an important birthday coming up I would always go to Scoosh to get it.  All in all, it's just a really nice shop in a lovely area. I love wandering around places like Scoosh!
5 I could only agree with Emily T I love Scoosh as well!   It's quirky, funky and everything that an independent boutique should be. Accessories, clothes, cards, it has it all and despite the slightly steep prices you will love the unique pieces it sells. I haven't got the foggiest idea of how to look cool in clothes but I always get compliments for my belt I got from here and the ladies who work here are absolutely lovely.  Great even just for a browse!
5 I love independent little boutiques and Scoosh is no exception. This quirky little store stocks glamorous dresses, stunning heels, jewellery and little gift ideas. The whole shop has an air of glamour about it and it reminds me of ladies who lunch.   A very cute shop with incredible attention to detail, if you're looking for a bit of glitz and glam in your life pop in here!
4 I didn't know too much about Scoosh other than it's a marshmallow delight of a shop!  Like getting hot chocolate with coffees and cream on top, Scoosh Ladieswear sell some secondhand garments with a little bit extra. The nearly new designers can be exchanged through a clothes swap of your own clothes for some of the stuff in here! How novel!  It's light, airy but well stocked. They are great at showcasing their most delightful items and are really helpful if you are having trouble choosing.  As Eleanor said it's an absolute must for ladies who like to lunch and then shop off what they've eaten! Great to look around on a relaxed day off, Scoosh is girly goodness at its best!
