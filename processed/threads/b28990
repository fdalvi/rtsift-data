5 Dr Sabeeh and Renae are fantastic. They made me feel very calm and collect about my decision. All details were carefully explained and they took the time to address any and all questions I had. My procedure was successful and Dr Sabeeh called to make sure I was good after. The follow up was top notch as well. I highty recommend Forma for anyone considering plastic surgery.
5 I learned about Forma through a client when I noticed how wonderful her procedure turned out and I couldn't wait to make my consultation appointment.  Upon arriving I realized the office is impeccable and the customer care is amazing, thank you Renae. Dr. Molly Walsh was full of all the information I was after and made me feel great about my decision,  from picking the right size to after care and everything in between,  I never thought twice. The surgery was exactly as explained and she has been available without a question for the whole experience.  I couldn't be happier with my result and the care I received. I would go back to Dr. Walsh in a heartbeat for any future plastic surgery.
