4 I spotted Sugarhouse Sandwiches when on my way to Wedgwood, the other day. It looked worth a visit, so I was glad to get an early chance to give it a whirl. Sandwiches are very good and the soup is also very tasty, so I'd recommend it for a lunchtime pit-stop. Their meal deal of soup and filled roll for Â£4 represents decent value.  Overall, we said: "Sugarhouse Sandwiches served me very nicely, today. The walk up Jacob's Ladder, to get back to my office, did return the burn to my legs for the first time since our little Brighton escapade, so I'm not sure it will be an everyday place, but it will go somewhere on the regular rota."
5 We were so lucky to find Sugarhouse while staying on the Royal Mile. Not only were the prices reasonable, but the food was delicious and the staff friendly! We returned because it was so great. What a gem -- highly recommended.
