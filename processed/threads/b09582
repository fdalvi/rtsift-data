5 The staff here is great.  I got into a fender bender with a State Farm customer so I went to one of State Farm's preferred auto body shops.  I went in on a Monday afternoon to just get an estimate done and they were able to take my car that day with a promise it would be done by the end of the week.  I wish I had gotten a call a little earlier than half an hour before they closed on Friday (since they are closed through the weekend) but bright and early on Monday morning, I was able to pick up my car and it looked great.  I don't have a single complaint about the work done here or the staff
2 They replaced my bumper  from a fender bender and it did not properly match the rest of the car.  I did purchase the manufacturer's bumper and not the after market, cheaper bumper because I wanted the car to look as good as before.  Some sections where the new bumper met the car were smooth and others there was a gap and the bumper stuck out more than the rear panel.  I had them re do it and it looks acceptable now but I feel like it could have been done much better overall.   Also, upon closer inspection I noticed that the bumper was missing a screw that would keep it on the car.  This lack of attention to detail, which in my opinion is absolutely essential when repairing and restoring a car to it's original state, left a sour taste in my mouth and I would not recommend them.
