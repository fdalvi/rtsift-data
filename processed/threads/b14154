5 dr Brian and his staff are simply fantastic! if you want to get to the root of the problem and not just cover up your symptoms with a pill, then going to an NMD is the way to go, as they will help give your body what it needs to take care of/heal itself!  both dr Brian and dr Elton are the picture of health - you know they practice what they preach!   they have helped me more than any western MD ever has!
5 Dr. Archambault provides very professional, thorough, and personalized patient care. His approach is holistic. He is knowledgeable when to utilize other forms of medicine. I have been a patient for close to two years and I have referred several friends and family members here.  I have also begun to find out that many of my friends already are members of what I like to call the West Valley Naturopathic Family.   If you are looking for comprehensive,  preventative or care for an auto - immune disease West Valley Naturopathic is the place to be.  I have never had such control over my allergies and homeopathic remedies thay actually work to keep away my re-occurant sinus infections. I have also had the pleasure of seeing Dr. Jennifer Elton who took excellent care of me as well.   If you seek a family atmosphere with top notch patient care, look no further!
