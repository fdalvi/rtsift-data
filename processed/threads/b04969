2 I took pictures while at this location last week. Its a ok store didn't care for the staff attitudes tho so I give it 2stars.
2 The shoes are disorganized.  Often the wrong size in the wrong box.  The staff is pleasant enough but do not seem to know anything about the shoes.  There is no one to help get shoes down from the top of the shelving and sometimes no employee to be seen for 5-10 minutes at a time.  The prices are mostly reasonable which saves this place from a one star rating and the shoes last a decent amount of time especially the kids shoes.  The selection is severely lacking.
3 I agree with the staff review...very plain and robotic. Payless has come a far way. I never used to shop for shoes here because they were such cheap quality but have gotten a lot better!! I come here mainly for the jewelry! Great prices and cute styles!
