5 Absolutely love it here!  One of the doctors came highly recommended by our pediatrician back in California and we're so glad we found her.  The facilities are very clean, bright, and welcoming.  The doctors and staff are friendly and accommodating.  Although there are many other offices closer to our home, we're happy to drive over half an hour to have all three of our children seen here.
4 I saw Amy the PA she was wonderful. Very supportive of our more natural approach to treating our son. Answered my very long list of questions without ever making me feel rushed. I wish the after hours was a little better but so far I'm really happy with this provider
5 We followed Dr. David Ciminello from Pueblo Pediatrics in Mesa to Desert Shores Pediatrics.  Dr. Ciminello is an outstanding pediatrician in all ways.  He has a wonderful bedside manner that allows him to connect with kids and his diagnosis's have been accurate.  He takes his time with patients and parents.  He thoroughly explains things and is prompt with follow-ups.  I have nothing but great things to say about him!
5 Great Pediatrician
