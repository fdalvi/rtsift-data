5 With so many lawyers in this town, while I was looking for a legal counsel, I focused on three factors: price, expertise and knowledge of the local government. All three factors lead me to the law firm of Reed and Mansfield. Their fee is reasonable as well as affordable and they've been in Las Vegas for a long time. This means I can be assured that I'm getting help from the people who know how to expertly navigate the legal system.   I like the fact that I was able to talk to an actual attorney within the firm and not a legal assistant. Daniel was super helpful and answered all of the questions I had for him. His knowledge in regards to various legal matters really impressed me and that made my decision to go with Reed and Mansfield an easy decision.   There is no reason to go elsewhere if you are seeking legal help that falls within their realm of specialty. I highly recommend this law firm!!!
5 Good experienced law firm. Personal injury and probate attorneys who give you personal attention at reasonable rates.  I have referred many of my clients to these lawyers and thay have all been pleased with the results.  These attorneys do the work themselves and don't delegate tasks to paralegals.  They return calls, texts and e-mails.  Gr8 at negotiation as well as litigation.
5 My wife and I were interested in creating a will and trust.  We called them up and they were professional from the beginning to the end.  Very knowledgable on all aspects and we felt like they gave us great advice.  Great father and son combo!  We will go back for sure.
