4 Great place for all your tobacco needs.  Friendly staff and very helpful when it comes to advise.  I would recommend this place to my friends and family.
4 Being new to the hobby I found Marty to be unbelievably helpful and ALWAYS friendly. I like the selection and customer service. I agree with Jim that $300 per year for the club is a little rough.
5 This place is utterly fantastic--I'm so glad I went.  The staff is very nice and extremely knowledgeable. The prices are quite competitive and the ambiance is relaxing. There are plenty of places to light up and kick back if you buy a cigar there.  By far the best part of the place is the private club. As mentioned by other reviewers, it is $300/year. But, you get your own locker where you can stash cigars and some of your favorite bottles. The club areas are very nicely appointed and clean--the perfect place to sit down and forget about your worries for a while. There is Direct TV, internet access, a small kitchen, and other perks.  I hesitate to call it the ultimate Man Cave, because they are clearly very welcoming to women.  But... it's the ultimate Man Cave.
