5 Attentive, humane attention. My son's knees were hurting him something awful. He listened carefully to his symptoms, observed him walking, and found the perfect solution shoes. Thanks!
1 Showed up about 4:30pm on Saturday after getting off work...they close at 5pm. Was made very clear that I was going  to put $145 towards a pair of boots they didn't even have in stock (and wait 7-10 days for delivery...are they coming from Russia?) or they just were not going to deal with me. Then I get the explanation of custom orthos and how it can take weeks to get accustomed to them...sorry, but the idea that pain equals solution and healing is archaic and lame. I'll spend my money somewhere that my comfort comes before their profit...you made it all about your profit, that came across very clear...now you have hundreds less.
5 Went here because my feet were painful and I just could not find comfortable shoes. The staff was very knowledgable and helped me pick out some great shoes and an orthotic to help with my foot problem. In 2 weeks my feet feel great and I will never go any where else for my feet and shoe needs.
