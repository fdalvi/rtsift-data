5 We have been using them for about 4 years now. We only use Blaire. He's amazing. Does such a great job and really takes his time. None of this 5 minute spraying and done. Highly recommend him!!! I am wickedly afraid of any creepy crawlers and he always makes sure the problem is taken care of. :) Blaire is the best.
5 To my horror we purchased furniture on Craigslist & there were bed bugs in the recliner. Luckily after calling several pest control companies & receiving estimates & inspections, I called Senske. Their service personnel was very knowledgeable & helpful. It took several weeks & repetitive treatments but my problem is solved. I would highly recommend this company. Thank you Eric.
4 Today was our second visit from Senske.  I don't remember the name of the guy who came out today and 2 months ago, but...I REALLY like this company.  I hate bugs.  Any kind of bug, it really doesn't matter.  Roaches, spiders, beetles, or even crickets...no thanks!!!  They freak me out.  We live in an older house, and have 5 people total living in the house, which makes having pest control SUPER affordable.    The first time he came out, he sprayed the whole house, and then did a "power spray" outside.   With the exception of 3-4 dead roaches in the doorway, I haven't seen ANY bugs at all.    He came by today for maintenance, and was super nice and polite, making sure he hadn't blocked me in, as I was on my way to work.  Affordable, effective, and very friendly, I highly recommend this company. :)
