2 This location is about a year old and last year they had amazing employees...just last Friday I came in and two guys just talked to each other the whole time.  No hello or anything.  He just went through the motions...it was quite bad.  Love my new boots!!
4 Im giving them one more shot. The employees are nice and helpful. They offer you popcorn. And it doesn't get any better with the prices especially when one pair is half off. They have lots of wide width sizes in men and women's.
4 My feet Love Sketchers!! However to get the shoes that love my feet I have to pay more. Yes they have sales, which are great for the most part if there is only you. But buying for a family does get pricey. I have always been able to get assistance, the employees are great and know their shoes. If you walk run or exercise these are the shoes for your feet.
