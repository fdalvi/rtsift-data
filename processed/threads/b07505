5 I bought my Lance camper from Arizona Campers in 2008 and have really enjoyed it.  Jim and Kyle were great to deal with and gave me a great deal on the camper.  I recommend them hands down as the best hometown dealer in the valley.  They also have an excellent service department to help me keep up with maintaning my camper.  I also had all of my truck accessories put on such as nerf bars, camper shell, and air bags. Anytime I have had questions or any needs that had to do with the camper they are always available.  They are family business that operates with integrity and friendliness that can still give you a great deal!
5 Family owned and operated. Nobody works on commission!
5 I found Arizona Campers on the internet, called and talked with Jim, the owner.  He told me he had two campers that would fit on my 2007 Dodge short-bed pickup.  He gave me the prices on each and also explained what was on each one.  The following morning we talked with Kyle to see if he would hold the campers for us until our arrival the following day.  He agreed to that.  We live in the Central Coast, CA area, so it was a long drive, but we are very happy that we drove the distance for our 825 Lance 2013 camper.  They had the camper looking  like new when we drove away, and we felt as if we not only dealt with an honest, family-owned business but also felt we were friends.  I felt as if the owner was working for me rather than for himself.  The truck/camper drives like a dream.  "Thank you" Arizona Campers.
