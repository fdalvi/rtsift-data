5 I have the most amazing experience with this company!!! Professional ,Extremely Friendly and right on point .I  recommend them  to everyone that needs appliance services of any kind   I needed my dishwasher fixed and after I called Katanny the scheduled appointment the same day and the job was done the same day  LOVE IT !!!!!!
5 Our He washer decided it wanted to break on us the Saturday morning before Memorial Day so we called Katanny because they had a cpl positive reviews & they were close to the house. The woman who schedule the appointments was able to get us in that afternoon & when the gentleman got there he was able to determine the source of the problem within about 15 mins.   Unfortunately since it was so late I the day he couldn't get the part & since it was a long weekend he couldn't get it to the shop until the following Tuesday. That said, Tuesday evening about 7PM I got a call from him saying the part had just arrived & that he could come over right then to install it. By 8:45 we had our washer back in service.   The whole time Katanny made sure to keep us in the loop with regards to what was going on & I couldn't have asked for a higher level of professionalism from an organization. I highly recommend them & will definitely use them again if I have another appliance failure.
