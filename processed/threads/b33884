3 This is a great place to come and take a look at Rolex watches and the people who work here of course know a ton of info on each watch. I wouldn't buy a watch here because you'll only get the retail price so after you try on the watch you're interested in and want, go to a grey market place and get your Rolex and you may save a few hundred bucks.
5 The service is outstanding here!  We were dressed like bums.  Actually, tourists wearing flip flops and sandals and were still greeted by Mike with a great welcoming attitude.  I was surprised b/c most of the time when we go into luxury/high end stores, we don't even get a hello unless we dress the part but we were on vacation.  So we were definitely not dressed to impress.     My husband knew what he wanted and asked about the New Submariner Date.  They had it in stock.  Mike showed it to us and told us all the great and new features it had compared to the old models.    We had to think about it and Mike was so patient with us.  He gave us his card.   We even called our local store to compare prices and their price was about $1,500 over this stores price for the same watch.  About a few hours later, we decided to make the purchase since we would be saving some money and went back to Mike.    Mike gave us a brand new one, never been touch or opened by anyone else.  He knew his stuff and have been with the company for 10 years.  This is the only Rolex store I would trust and he's the only person I would purchase from.  We'll be getting our next one with Mike.   If you go there, ask for Mike!!!
