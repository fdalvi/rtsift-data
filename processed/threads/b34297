5 Okay, this is my first review on Yelp. I'm an airline employee and have moved coast to coast. I always redo my flooring on all of my homes. This is the first time a company had showed up on time and worked non stop  9-10 hours each day. The attention to detail is amazing and they were courteous at all times. The sales manager Quoc Luu is a pleasure to work with and is a true gentleman. The floors, staircase and base boards looks so beautiful. I will tell everyone that is looking for flooring to look up Vegas Flooring Outlet. Oh yeah,  the pricing of install was $1.50 a sq ft. everybody else charged $2.00. I saved so much money and I could not have better results!!!!  Thanks, Johnny
5 Vegas Flooring Outlet rocks!  Just got done doing my entire house and I couldn't be any happier.  Their team was there to help me every step of the way.  Let me put it to you like this, if you want to get taken care of and not jerked around go see these guys.  Very knowledgable and personable.  They are family to me now!.  Thanks
5 I worked with Jimmy.  He and Vegas Flooring were excellent in every respect.  They did my stairs and upstairs.  The installers (Jesus and Ramon) were outstanding. I only have positive things to say about the whole experience.  I couldn't recommend them more highly.  Call Jimmy and give him a shot!
5 AMAZING!!! I had horrible floors when I bought my house, I now have the most amazing floors an baseboards! The price was more than fare and the result is beautiful. Now that the downstairs of my house is done I will be scheduling the upstairs. They do the best work I'm so excited for our next project
5 I went here needing help with carpet and they helped me out so much!! So many places to choose carpet from here in Vegas and I would come back here. Hands down. They exceeded my expectations for sure! Thanks guys!
