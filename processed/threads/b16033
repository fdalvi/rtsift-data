5 Great to see a Coffee Bean on the strip - got my no-sugar-added mocha on and ready for another few hours in Sin City.  Free WiFi too if you can't get service for your device through cellular, which is often the case on the strip . . .
4 Great coffee and tea shop.  So many teas to choose from and free wifi.   They have a couple of tables out front in the mall that I did some homework at but it  was quite loud with all the foot traffic in the mall.    Good little coffee joint on the strip.
4 I normally don't like coffee shops on the strip but I do like this one.  The place looks clean and smells great. Staff is friendly. I'll be revisiting it.
4 Inside the Planet Hollywood mall area, this location is ok. Not as friendly service as im used to but they do make a good coffee. Less hassle then the starbucks in planet hollywood casino.
4 I really like this location because you get a lot of coffee for a cheaper price than most other coffee shops on the Strip; however, if you get almond milk, they charge a ridiculous $1.25-$1.50 and then another $.50-$.75 for a flavor shot, if you want that, too.  Considering the choice to have almond/ soy milk is more for health-related reasons, it really does stink to have to pay so much for that option, but since it is Vegas and I already expect to pay more for all food, I just dealt with it and paid.  I agree with others, though, in that this place has friendly staff, good people that come here, and it is in a great location across from the City Center in the Planet Hollywood shops.  Definitely come by!  If you don't care for almond/soy milk, you can get a 16 ounce beverage for between $5-$6.  :)
4 Very good coffee. But I would skip the pastries and muffins. Not that great tasted stale.
