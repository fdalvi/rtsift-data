4 This is a great smoke shop for hookah smokers. They carry a wide variety of shisha (Al Fahker, Starbuzz, etc) for a great price, especially if you pay with cash. Family owned, very helpful.
5 If you smoke hookah, this is the place to buy your shisha! They've got a great selection of flavors and brands at fantastic prices. They also have high quality accessories (hoses, bowls, coals) and hookahs available too. If for some reason you don't see what you want, let the staff know & they'll do what they can to get it for you. Tell Koba that you saw this review on Yelp! Oh yeah, there are also cigarettes & fragrances here too ;)
5 Love this place! Cheap, close, & very friendly!
