4 Great place to go for a quality car wash.  It's located on the east side and even though the appearance at first could change your mind. Don't be afraid to give this place a chance!  You drive up to the side and there's workers ready to help you for whatever you want to get done to your car. They have a big menu posted and you get to choose what service you want. I personally choose the $17.99 value wash which includes vacuuming, polishing, waxing and washing. You head inside afterwards to pay in which the cashier gives you a card with a stamp that will verify the workers outside if you paid or not. The wait time depends on what time you go and if no one is ahead of you. I went recently and had no one there.. Then suddenly 3 minutes afterwards 6 people walked in! I probably waited a total of 10-15 minutes for my car.  Some people may think $17.99 is expensive for a car wash. That itself is true, but this does not only include a car wash but vacuuming, polishing and waxing. I think that itself is well worth the $17.99 - plus my friend who introduced me to this place informed me that they do a guarantee re-wash if within a certain amount of days we get rainy weather. You might want to check up on that though.
4 I started coming to this car wash a couple of years ago off a recommendation from my mother-in-law. She comes here all the time to get her oil changed. Now I do the same. The appearance of this car wash is not the best, but the service has always been good and I haven't had a bad experience here yet. Although I can go to other places to get the oil changed in my cars, I like coming here because the oil change comes with a car wash. So coming here is like hitting two birds with one stone. The crew here does a great job to make my cars look extra clean and I don't think I'll go anywhere else for a car wash unless I do it myself. Aside from the things I've already mentioned, I have had windshield and headlight repairs done at this location and both repairs were reasonably priced and done well. The only gripe I have is the wait time because they can get very busy at times. Anyway, kudos to you guys! You have a loyal customer and I have already recommended this place to my friends and family.
1 I have been going to this car wash for years with good service until yesterday. I was treated rudely and disrespectfully by the Owner's Brother (unfortunately the Owner was not there and had left his Brother in charge) what a mistake! After this experience (whereas the Brother wouldn't even take time to speak with me about me concerns) I will NEVER give this place any of my money again and certainly would not recommend this place to anyone! It's a shame.
