4 Great store. Staff is friendly and helpful. The only thing I probably won't use again is their dog grooming service. i've used it a few times (two Shih Tzus) and I can't say I loved the cuts. They looked a bit rushed and uneven. They do have quite a volume of dogs so I'm not sure if that's a contributing factor. No problem though. I get my supplies there and a dog groomer closer who has a little more time to do a thorough cut.
5 The whole staff at this place is AWESOME!! They are very helpful and friendly.  I love that they offer so many services.  My puppy is doing training right now and she love this place.  She says two paws up to this Petsmart.  Kelsey is our trainer and she is very knowledgeable.  The ladies at the groomers are wonderful as well.  Don't hesitate to use this Petsmart if you live close to it.
5 This particular PetSmart is small, however the grooming salon is awesome!  The groomer Alice has been taking all 3 of our dogs for almost 2 years.  She knows our dogs by name and sight and they just love her!  She does an amazing job every time!  I would recommend this location and particular groomer to anyone.
5 Competitive prices and great selection items for our pets.  Had return that I thought I was going to get a lot of grief about with no receipt.  The manager Donna helped me out and did not make me feel like an idiot for not keeping the receipt. She was also helpful with cat litter recommendations. Kudos to Donna!
3 Visited this location on Saturday for supplies for a lizard cage and a toy for my pup. This location is nice and my dog had a great time meeting all the other dogs wandering around the store.
5 Went here and the trainer Anthony was awesome he was so friendly and really help us train our dog at home taking his training class really helped us  Our puppy is now a star :) thank u Anthony
