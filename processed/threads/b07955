4 Very clean store and friendly service. This is a smaller warehouse type of store that you can shop at with no membership card requirement. I go here when I need to buy in bulk for my classroom goodies, staff in-services, school parties, and for my teacher appreciation treaties. I do not have the need to go very often. However, when I can't get a friend who has another "warehouse" membership card to shop for me, I drop by here. They have limited items of course but it is great when I need fifty 100,000 bars. lol
5 In a neighborhood where there isn't much around beside a small complex with a few restaurants but mostly fast food. Their price are awesome, clean store and friendly staff who are always happy to help you with anything. Got anything you need here but I is more toward business items and wholesale products. Come here often and will recommend.
1 Normally my family has had very good luck at Smart and Final.  However this time after purchasing a 17.5 lbs of Tri-tips I got home and started getting them ready for the next days grilling and literally trimmed of over 5 lbs of fat.  This is totally unacceptable.  Not  sure what to think, I understand there is going to be a fat cap but 5lbs is very excessive.   See photo's.
