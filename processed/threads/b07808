5 I have been a patient at Kimel Chiropractic for 6 years and can't say enough about the care I have received.  I have had several surgeries and procedures for various female and stomach problems, all of which were never conclusive or able to be fixed without heavy medication.  After starting my care at Kimel Chiropractic I live a completely different life, which is not dependent on medication and actually feeling healthy!  I am no longer burdened with constant pain or problems!  I recommend Kimel Chiropractic for your entire family, my husband, and 2 year old and I couldn't be happier or feel better!
5 I have been going to Kimel Chiropractic for 16 years.  They are a great, family-owned business who actually cares about my health and well-being!  They've helped me through many back issues I had in high-school from being an athlete, a car accident I had in college, and they've been with me during two of my pregnancies helping my body stay aligned and adjust to the changes taking place.  My husband, two kids (ages 2 and 6) and I go there at least twice per month to get regular adjustments.  We all are much healthier since we've been going to them on a regular basis and we feel great!
5 Wow, just got back from here after having middle back pain this morning.  I called and they took me right in with no wait.  They did a full test and used this awesome external EMG test that can see the muscles in the spine and show where I need work.  I thought this was the coolest thing to see.  The bench they work on you with moves up and down while they work and it's pretty cool.  Nick worked on me and I can tell you that I am glad I went since it was not to aggressive but very effective.  I have been to chiropractors in the past and left in more pain but not today.  They did a great job and I will most definitely go back.
