4 Ice Blended!
4 Winter Dream Tea Latte! Yumm! The staff is really cool! This coffee shop said they ran out of the WDTL. Since I bought the WDTL tin they opened the tin for me, and made the coffee for free! Very kind of them.
5 This place is the perfect spot in the new terminal at McCarran. The fact that it is an offering that is not Starbucks is awesome. Not that I don't like Starbucks, but variety is the spice to life!  The space is efficient and has plenty of seating. It is open to the main walkway of the terminal, so you can people watch while sitting at a table.  I've had numerous drinks here, as well as bagels (which they will toast for you yay!). Anything I've gotten has been good, hot, and served quickly.  Overall, for a place in an airport The Coffee Bean is surpassing most others.
3 Great coffee, I've had it when I've flown out of the airport in Vegas, Phoenix and I found out in a neighborhood in Hawaii.  There mixed drinks are really sugary, so if you are into sweet coffee drinks this is the place for you!
5 Blended ultimate hazelnut with ALMOND MILK! First Coffee Bean that I've found with this option. Awesome!
3 I was stuck at LAS for a couple of hours due to a delayed flight, and figured I'd pick up a chai and a bagel while waiting.  The cashier was super outgoing and friendly (almost painfully so, given that it's an airport), and my order was filled quickly.  However, it was almost nine dollars for a small chai and toasted bagel with cream cheese, which was also a bit painful.    I'd probably go to Starbucks next time, just because of the rewards program, but kudos to the cashier for great customer service!
4 This airport is a hellhole. It's like MCO (Orlando) in that you have a lot of people who don't travel often and don't know what they're doing or where they're going. But unlike MCO, most of them aren't kids, so when they're terrible at walking there's no excuse. Dudes: do not stop walking in the middle of a busy through way. Walk over to the side, just like if you were driving. Also, there's bright, ugly slot machines everywhere. The food is even more ridiculously overpriced than you might expect.  All that plus an early morning, and feeling adrift in time and space thanks to sleeping on the plane. I'm usually not this cranky at airports. I don't mind layovers, especially not short ones. But I felt like a zombie and was miserable.  Luckily for me, I stumbled into this place. The baristas were kind. The coffee was excellent, and quickly delivered. The prices aren't nearly as exorbitantly jacked up as other places in the airport.
2 Of all the coffee specialty chains, this one has to be toward the "least tasty coffee" end of the spectrum.   Before I get to the coffee let me mention the olfactory ambiance of Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf stores. There is this sickeningly sweet flavored coffee smell in each of these stores. Personally this dude cannot abide with the smell. It borders on nauseating. And even in a mall like situation the smell comes through loud and clear.  Back to the coffee....  So we were on our way back to Philly after visiting home (California) for Thanksgiving. We had a plane change and instead of going to Dunkin Donuts to get their "jus de chausette," we thought we would get a better cup of coffee at The Bean and Tea Leaf.   Oy, were we wrong! We got  BURNT "jus de chausette."  Now what is "jus de chausette?" It translates as "sock juice." Back in the day before Mr. Coffee and Bun-o-Matic coffee makers, people in France used to use socks as coffee filters. It doesn't make the best coffee but that's what they did. It tended to produce a weak coffee (think American coffee like at Dunkin Donuts or a generic diner.) that was not flavorful.  Now of course we have Carte Noir, Philz Coffee, Peet's Coffee and Italian coffee pots that make tastier coffee.   Go elsewhere if you want something tastier than sock juice.
2 It's your average coffee bean: decent coffee with simple flavors, and their signature iced blended drinks. They also offer chai teas (non authentic), and two flavored teas: blood orange and agave nectar.  It's good in a pinch, but the airport is often hectic and takes a while to get drinks. Both myself and another customer's drinks had to be remade - my iced blended coffee wasn't sugar free, and another drink was downsized.  But the ladies took the time out from our drinks to make one for another employee as well as chit chat.... And were MUCH nicer to the other airport guy than to any customers.  I guess it's just an airport cafe, right?   Next time I'll try to find the Starbucks.
4 Had a layover in Las Vegas airport, and decided to check this place out. Decided to get an iced tea instead of coffee. The lady working recommended the blood orange ice tea -- it was really good! Not too sweet, and it was an ice tea that was unique and different.
3 I remember seeing Coffee Bean in LA first and now it seems to be everywhere. I grabbed a quick breakfast and drink after landing in Vegas from here.
1 This place is horrible. They nickel and dime everything. I asked for an extra cup and they charged me 64 cents. That's why they never grew up to the stature of sbux. Sucks.
3 Living in Northern California, I miss Coffee Bean coffees. We have a few shops out here, but there aren't nearly as many of them available as there are Starbucks, Peet's or even Philz. So anytime I get a chance to grab a Coffee Bean, I'll take the opportunity.  The clerk at this location was friendly and helpful; however, service wasn't good in the sense that there's only one person working this entire kiosk. Fortunately, I wasn't in a huge rush, as she had to first take my order, make my beverage, then collect payment. Probably not the most efficient, but the best that she could do given the resources.  In the end, all I wanted was a yummy tasting beverage, and did, indeed, get what I was craving for!
1 I havent written a review for years but these two young ladies were so rude that i had to.  Early flight out this morning, needed a fix.  Customer service is not in thier vocabulary!  Ordered a caramal machiato which I ended up throwing away.  Save your money and go to Starbucks!!!
