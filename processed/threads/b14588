3 Free fries?  Came here for free fry promotion.  Wasn't crazy about the new fries.  Service was adequate and fast through drive through.
3 I tried one of thier new breakfast sandwiches with gouda cheese and having never had it before, wasn't sure what to expect.  To my surprise it was better than I thought it might have been.  The store was slow so service was quick and pleasent.  No reason for me not to go there again.
4 I work nearby and have nothing negative to say about this location. They don't screw up your order which is always nice (ordering in or at the drive-thru). The staff is polite and unlike a lot of places no one is yelling or cursing at each other. Loses a star because it could you use a little facelift.
