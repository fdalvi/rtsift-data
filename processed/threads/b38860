4 I've only been here once, unfortunately, as I discovered it right before leaving Madison, but hopefully I'll go back someday!  The bookstore is large - there seemed to be another room off each room I entered! In the back they had a ton of mysteries, including pre-owned books. I could have spent hours there.   The staff was really friendly, too. You can also order things online, which is great when what you're looking for isn't in stock.
5 I had a great time browsing this store.  They had so many books to go through.  This store is really big and around every corner seemed to be another room filled with books.  The store is laid out in an easy to explore manner with all the books clearly organized by subject and author.  If you like browsing through bookstores like I do I would tell you this is a must visit store.
