5 I'm in Vegas on a girls trip, of course shopping is going to be part of the adventure.  While walking through the Forum we stumbled into Tadashi.  The display is so BEAUTIFUL and since it's in the Forum our first reaction was that it was ridiculously expensive.  No one wanted to venture in and I said LET'S SEE.    SO happy we walked in here.  The dresses are stunning, they look like they cost $1000's but were all under $400 AND they have a 50% off clearance area.  Of course we went shopping.  The staff is super nice and if you have your husband along there is a beautiful sitting area near the dressing rooms for their comfort.  This is a MUST stop shop if you are in the Forum.  It's upstairs near the Planet Hollywood restaurant.  From now on when I have a formal or cocktail event to go to, this WILL be my first stop.
5 We had a wonderful, relaxing, low pressure experience here thanks to Samantha, the associate who helped our niece. Samantha was very knowledgable and tasteful, ensuring our complex set of needs were met.  I highly recommend this shop for the best dresses possible.
