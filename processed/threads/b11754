3 nice timeshare with all the amenities you would need for an extended stay. a good sized living area, dining area, kitchen, bedroom (with walk in closet!) bath and washer/dryer.  there is also a workout area, pool, barbecue area and free movie dvd rentals.  i really enjoyed my stay here and would recommend this place for someone looking for peace and quiet.  this is a bit away from the strip.. about a 15-20 min, depending on traffic.  the free shuttle to the strip is great, however, can be a little inconvenient (it only runs through a certain time each night).  if you're looking to party in las vegas, you probably want to book a location closer to the strip. if you're looking for some time away to relax (with side trips to the strip), this is the place for you.
2 Pretty decent condo-style resort / timeshare to spend your week.  I had a spacious 1,000 sqft 1 bedroom unit with an in-unit laundry facility, which was very convenient.   Everything was very clean and there was plenty of bath towels.   Only 2 negatives: a)  $50 per week fee for internet access which wasn't even that fast, only 300-500 kb/s, not suitable for streaming videos, just good for emailing and light surfing, AND b) units around the pool area will be able to hear a low generator humming noise at night. Unfortunately, my unit was next to the pool area, so I slept with earplugs on.  Lastly, annoying kids with squeaky high pitched voices seem to wake up early in the morning and frolic in the pool, so I couldn't sleep in no later than 8 am.   Also, you'll need a car if you want to get around from here.  It's about 25 minutes to the strip, but there was plenty of stores and eateries within 5 minutes.  Would I stay here again? Only if I don't get a unit near the pool area and internet connectivity was faster, preferably 1 mbs+.
3 Pretty much they are like mini apartments, the Cliffs at Peace Canyon are decent and come with an almost fully equipped kitchen. The amenities like the gym and game room were okay nothing special. The only things that I did not like about the place was one we found a cockroach in the kitchen that wasn't at all sanitary. And I personally like the rooms cold when i sleep because it makes it easier for me and for some reason the master bedroom would not get cold so me and my boyfriend had to sleep in the guest bedroom which was okay and the the temp was just how i like it.   so all and all it was a pleasant stay nothing to over the top its in a nice area so it is very easy to go shopping and a lot of restaurants near by.
4 Nearly perfect place to stay. Two things that were dissappointing is old tube tvs and all that space in the bathroom and no jacuzzi tub. Kitchen was perfect had everything I needed. The best was the free shuttle to and from the strip for free. Steve is the best driver!
1 DO NOT STAY HERE!  I would give half a star if a could.  1. Everything is small! The kitchen, the rooms, the living room, the tv, THE POOL is SMALL.  2. Its a $50 cab ride ONE WAY from the strip. (shuttles stop at 11.) 3. They charge extra for "cleaning". We checked out and they charged an EXTRA $150 because there was "trash not in bags". The maids are only suppose to "wipe counters down and make the beds". What kind of cleaning service do they have?!  4. They expect you to walk your trash to the dumpster out in the 100 degree weather.  5. Everything is outside. They are mini outside apartments.  Don't waste your vacation/money here. There are MUCH better options.  HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND!
3 We have stayed here a couple of times using our time share.  The Cliffs are a long distance from the Strip.  It is much closer to Red Rock Canyon than to the action on the Strip.  If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Vegas Strip, then this might be the place for you.  For my wife and I, we prefer staying somewhere other than right on the main strip.  Each time, we stayed at the Cliffs, there was family staying with us.  We had a 2 bedroom unit so staying here made for awesome family quality time!  The kids really enjoyed the pool which did not get very crowded during our summer time stays here.  We were able to use their Bbq grills to cook food for dinner!  We went hiking at Red Rock Canyon nearby.  Our times here have been very relaxing.  The rooms have always been huge and comfortable for everyone.  The one time that we had an issue, management was able to resolve it.  The fact that the issue took a few weeks to resolve is the reason that I can only give them 3 stars.  We have not stayed there again since.    Would we stay here again in the future?  Yeah, if it was the only place available for our timeshare.
4 This place was cool. Nice furnishings. Comfortable bed. Loved the shower!
4 Perfect set up for an extended Vegas stay **off** the strip. We had a nice 1 bedroom set up, with a full bathroom, dining area, kitchen and living space. Clean, neat, friendly staff. Nothing to complain about at all.  If you are looking for a luxurious strip setting, keep looking, If you are looking for a clean, safe, affordable place to use as a mini home away from home while in Vegas, this is the place for you.  (side note, I rated sleep quality average, but that wasn't the hotel's fault. The last 2 nights of our stay we had someone with a small child and an extreme lack of manners in the room above ours, Their child was allowed to stampeded thru their room very late into the evening, to the point where I had to call the front desk at 1am to ask them to get us some relief. They scrapped their chairs constantly and seemed to be intentionally stomping their feet . Again, not the CLiffs fault, but annoying nonetheless.)
5 We came to Vegas for reasons like few others - we hit all of the Savers thrift stores in Vegas and Henderson.   Due to this we didn't need to be near the strip. The Cliffs were quiet, clean and spacious; for those that care, about a 20 minute drive to the Strip and a few minutes from the Red Rock Casino if you wish to drop a dime.   We loved the peace and quiet and wouldn't have known the complex was sold out if not told that at the front desk.   The size of the units are large, I'd say more than double the size of your average Vegas hotel room. The spacious balcony was awesome - in the early mornings and after sundown the temperature is perfect and there's a nice breeze. The kitchens come fully stocked with everything you would need - glasses, plates, silverware, cooking utensils, pots and pans, can opener, bottle opener, wine opener, etc. etc. and the washer and dryer came in very handy to wash loads of newly purchased thrift bargains!!   Regarding the shared use options, there is a billiard table and a nice community room, neither of which we used. We did use the fitness center and found it clean with the machines in very good shape, water dispenser, towels and TV with remote. The pool and Jacuzzis were both nice and were used at the end of the day. Some have mentioned the noise around the pool with children - since we were busy finding amazing deals at air conditioned Savers stores during the hot hours of the day, we didn't notice the noise at the pools.  The only thing that could possibly make it better would be having a restaurant/bar on site but that's really no big deal as we just bought/brought our own libation and food.  We are 40 and 45 years of age and childless and this property probably caters more to families but we don't really care, we never saw any; in fact we rarely saw anyone...anywhere! But all the parking spots were taken so it was obviously full up.
3 We are Grandview owners and this is a sister property so we expected it to be the same. It's not.   Beds are hard and lumpy. Pillows are cheap and worn out. Stinks of smoke despite being non smoking. The room drapes and furniture smell of old smoke so I dont think they get deep cleaned often.   The place is over run with pigions which are noisy starting about 2 hours before sunrise.   The pool is closed for renovations and despite calling several times they never Mentioned it. We specifically seek out places with heated pools in winter so my whole party of 12 were disappointed. Not discount or comp was offered.  They claimed to be inside Summerlin but they are not, near the furthest edge but if you need to be in Summerlin it's 20 to 30 minutes from the center of Summerlin wasting a lot of our time.   If I had more time I'd go off on the annoying and aggressive sales people but that's for another day.
5 Enjoyed ourselves. No complaints. We're still here for a few days and don't expect that our feelings will change. The accommodations are lovely.   Close enough to the strip to get into the action of Las Vegas, but far enough away to feel what else Vegas has to offer. We'd definitely come back!
4 -1 star for the annoyance of "getting a parking pass". You check in and have to go to a different counter to get your "parking pass" at which point you are solicited for all these "freebies" to take a tour/survey. A few affirming No's will get them off your back, but the whole song and dance routine is not needed. Overall a great property, at a great location. If you stay in a bottom unit be prepared to hear thunder when the people above you come in. The ceilings are thin.  ***The pool is great, heated well and the hot tub is spacious.   ***FYI the wifi is only good for two devices and it is pay per day or discounted for a week. I did not use it and just set my phone up as a hotspot. Great 4gLTE reception here.   Had a two room unit, and it is spacious and comfortable. The bed could be better, its easy to tell its low quality, not a big deal to me though.
2 My folks and I bought at the Cliffs years ago and have made it a tradition to reserve our time annually between Christmas and New Years. We have a two bedroom unit and I have relatively few complaints about the rooms themselves. I do, however, think it's time for them to take care of a few simple things. 1) New Cardio equipment: The equipment is run down and approaching the status of ghetto. The last four years I have gone to 24 hour fitness on Tropicana just to get a good morning of cardio because the elliptical, treadmills, and are pretty tore up. The nautilus weight equipment is decent but the rest needs replacement. 2) Wifi. There should be free wifi for ALL guests. Because this is our home location we were given a 1 week prepaid card good for two users. This is nice and all but when my wife, myself, and my father are there with our smartphones and laptops 2 free users isn't enough. Starbucks, LAX, and almost every restaurant where I live have free wifi.
2 We booked our room and were told it was 3 room and sleeps 6. When we arrived we were given a 2 room apartment with a fold out couch and we were told that there was nothing bigger available. There is no free WiFi...even the $26 a night dives near the strip have free WiFi. 2 of the lights were burned out. The tv's are still crt and cable service is spotty on many channels. They chill the pool outside to 83° (which is way too cold in my opinion). There is no view outside our windows and not much sunlight through the windows as well. We can only see allyways outside our first floor apartment and hear the people thundering over our heads as they walk. Overall, I am not satisfied.
3 We are coming back to Vegas and were going to stay at the Cliffs again. We usually stay somewhere else on the east side of the city but wanted to focus our visit on the west side again since we loved the Cliffs so much.  Unfortunately the Cliffs has now contracted the Vegas bug of implementing RESORT FEES. Out of principal we just don't pay a fee for staying in a hotel where we're already paying an overnight charge.  To the guests of hotels that charge these resort fees, it gives the appearance that you are cheap and nickel and diming us to death. Often these resort fees aren't even known of by the traveler and then the guests are doubly angry when they find out about them on check in or check out.  Why not just raise the room price $25? Another plus for your guests if you do this is when they are using reward nights from frequent booking programs like hotels.com they can then have the total cost of the room covered by these reward hotel room nights, otherwise they have to not just pay the taxes as an extra cost but also another $25 resort fee.
4 This was a very nice place to stay. It is far enough off the strip to be family friendly and is close to the freeway to provide easy access to any place in Las Vegas and Henderson. I would have like to have had better WiFi, but we brought our own hotspot that proved to be more reliable and faster. We had a one bedroom. The rooms were clean, modern, and well equipped. The staff was friendly and attentive. We especially enjoyed meeting Danny! He was always full of energy and put a smile on our faces. We look forward to our return. If you stay here, you should try Juan's Flaming Fajitas!
