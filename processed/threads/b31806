5 As a military veteran I am very fortunate to have the VA medical services. The clinic on Rancho is new and beautiful. The staff is very respectful and extremely helpful. People are always thanking us veterans for our service but please remember to thank the people who serve us veterans!
4 Just moved here from out of state, took 3 months to get my first appointment , then they canceled and rescheduled, a month further out.  A month out from my scheduled appointment they canceled again and pushed out 6 weeks further.  Had to go to the ER at the VA hospital to get my meds renewed since the VA only gave me a 90 day supply for moving.  Finally the ER doctor got me into see a doctor inside of 2 weeks.    I give them a higher rating since I was referred to specialty clinics at the VA hospital.  The doctor ordered tests and follow up appointments with him.   The doctors at the VA hospital actually treated me like crap, and yes appointments were canceled and changed there also.  I would think they would have a better system.  I am rating the hospital on a separate page.
5 Once you get past scheduling the appointment the clinic itself is an awesome experience. It runs like a well oiled machine and you can't see a frown in sight. All the staff is friendly and helpful. The volunteers do an incredible job at making you feel welcome and comfortable. The waiting area ambiance is very relaxing and its designed that way on purpose. They have stacked vending machines with plenty of choices and reasonably priced items. Free coffee is offered through out the day until the early afternoon and its fresh till the end.   The Doctors are skilled and helpful and do everything they can to meet your needs. The waits are not usually long unless they are short staffed or are running behind which is something you'll find anywhere.
