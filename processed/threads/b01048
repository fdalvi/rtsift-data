5 The salon is nice and inviting, has always been a pleasant experience.  Katie is a coloring master!  She definitely knows her stuff and I've always walked away from her cuts and colors a happy customer.  I know at least 20 other people who won't let anyone but Katie touch their hair...she's that good.  Highly recommend her!  Oh yeah, they have goodies to eat and drink while you're there, always appreciated. and some great jewelry...!
4 Was gifted a facial to this lovely salon in Phoenix.  I've been here several times before for other services, but this was the first facial I have received.  Jen Huston was the esthetician and she was very nice and friendly.     As we went through the facial, she explained every thing she was doing and why we were doing it (ie. I'm using a pumpkin enzyme on you because it helps break up the dead skin cells, it will feel tingly).  It was really great!  She also gave great skin care tips and never pressured you to buy any products.    Plus, she didn't leave the room while you are getting your mask.  Instead, she gave a great neck and shoulders massage and scalp massage.    My skin looked and felt great afterward!  I'll definitely check her out next time I'm in town.  Plus, the price is great.  She also works at their Chandler location.
5 one day i was shopping in one of my favorite stores, LUSH, and i noticed one of the employees had GORGEOUS curls. i complimented her on them and started in with the usual styling product questions. she briefly told me what she used but credited her amazing curls to her stylist, lauren williams at leidan mitchell salon.  i took down the number, but i held on to it for a while before calling. i was loyal to my current stylist. after a few times of inability to coordinate an appointment with her, i gave up and decided it was the perfect time to try out someone new.  it took me a few tries to get in with lauren because our schedules are pretty much opposite, but when i finally did it was worth it. i told her i needed a change and basically gave her free reign over my hair. i went from blonde to red, and i never thought of myself as a redhead but i love it. i don't think i've gotten so many compliments on my hair in my life!  my next trip she chopped my hair (at my request) and gave me amazing bangs. i never thought i could even wear bangs with my coarse thick curls, but she showed me how to style them and make it work.  lauren is amazing! she even texts me to follow up a few days after my appointment to make sure i'm happy with my hair. i highly recommend her.
5 Lauren continues to amaze me with her hair knowledge and skills. She consistently educates herself on the newest techniques and products. I don't have to worry about keeping up with everything because she lets me know about what new products I should try for my hair. I think she knows my hair better than I do!   I used to hate getting my hair done, but now I look forward to it just so I can see Lauren! She is the perfect balance between friendly and professional. I've had stylists before who adopt that friendly demeanor, but then they think they can cancel your appointment at the last minute or quadruple book you and leave you waiting for hours. I've never had to wait for Lauren, and she will perfectly time a haircut to be finished while my color processes. It's pretty amazing now that I think about it.   Lauren is fabulous. She schedules her appointments on her cell at 602-435-6199.
5 Annette Garcia fixed a major mistake of another salon on my hair - Yea Annette to the rescue. I walked out looking sassy and feeling better than ever. Then she suggested getting a new lipstick and the make-up lady found a new color that popped. Go here if you really want professionals that care about their work and how you look and feel!
5 This salon has the most professional staff. Cynthia is my stylist and she is always on time and always has given me great cuts. I know my hair will looks its best when I leave this salon.
5 Lauren Williams is a curly hair expert and continues to provide amazing service. She is now using an organic color line which I LOVE! My hair has never looked better.   I have never stuck with a hairstylist for this long, but Lauren has me hooked. She is the best, and I get compliments on my hair every time I go out.  She also does not overbook, yet she always gets me in when at the time and date I request. She really provides superior customer service which I greatly appreciate.
5 The place is a nice backdrop for Jennifer "J" that does my hair. She is a fantastic colorist.  I won't go to anyone else.  Definitely worth the thirty minute drive.
5 I saw Jennifer Houston for a Dermaplaning treatment. I was impressed with the salon, the atmosphere and Jennifer's knowledge and expertise. The service was performed perfectly and I wouldn't hesitate to refer her! It's obvious that she is a very skilled aesthetician, but it's her warm and friendly personality that really puts you at ease immediately.
5 Since I recently moved I was in the market for a new stylist closer to home than my previous residence in Scottsdale.  After searching on Yelp, which never disappoints, I found this salon 5 minutes from my home and on my route to work.  Perfect location with a recent review for a particular stylist (Lauren) and her impeccable skill with curly hair.  I made an appointment and I am impressed.  She did an amazing job, really listened to what I wanted which did change throughout our conversation and I am in love with my new hairstyle.
2 I hate to leave negative feedback, but I just was not impressed!  I was wanting a salon closer to work/home, but I think I will just go back to my stylist in the west valley.  I was there on a Saturday and is was very busy, which I took as a good sign.  However once I stepped out of the reception area, I was instantly uncomfortable.  Its hard to explain what made me uncomfortable...maybe just me?  The salon is nicely decorated with an antique theme.  They use great products.  What I really didn't like is that I was in and out in 1 hour with color and cut!  Their prices reflect quality work, but I do not feel I received this.  You want me to spend over $100 in 1 hour?!  Un, no.  The consultation was 3 minutes at best which resulted in me not getting what I wanted and my stylist answered a personal call on her phone.  I do like my hair color, but not the leftover on my forehead.  I don't know if it was my stylist or if all the stylists have time limits for services, but it was just rushed.
5 "Erika is the best professional at making my hair behave & look good!"
5 I have been going here for about a year. I found this place online and called to make an appointment because they are close to my house. They scheduled me with Ashley Nelson. She is super sweet and amazing. She always gets the color perfect and the cut always looks great. I will not go to anyone else. My suggestion is to make your appointment in the morning as parking gets a little crazy closer to lunch time because its a busy plaza. I would highly recommend this place.
5 Love this salon. Very clean and all of the stylist are very talented. If you are looking for someone new ask for Hannah, she is also the best at extensions. Great local business to support. Very convenient location no matter where you are located in the valley
3 I have been going to this salon for a few months. They seem to have good hair products but are a bit expensive.
5 What a great location. I saw THOMAS MARTIN. What a great stylist! He listens and did an excellent job of getting me what I wanted for my hair. The cut was precise and the color poppin! Will def be coming back!
5 Julia is amazing! Not only is she super nice, but she is great at what she does! My hair was a mess. I don't know how she did it, but the girl worked magic!
1 Would recommend to not offer a Groupon if you can't answer your phone or return a bloody text message. 3 attempts and nothing. Even went in there to make an appointment. Was given a card and told to call for an appointment. Sure, that worked,. This was counterproductive and a colossal waste of time!  Perhaps you can extend some professionalism and honor your offer. Fortunately, Groupon credited my account. Buyer beware!
