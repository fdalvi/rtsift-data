1 Never enter this place unless you're looking to get ripped off!  No refund/return policy on your receipt.  Biggest buyers remorse ever!
1 This place is horrible! I called to see if they carried an Olympus TG-130 in stock and the employee on the phone put me on hold for over 30 minutes like its BestBuy or something. I had to repeat TG to her about 4 times before I had to give her phonetic alphabet so she could know that T=Tango and G=Golf...No! I had to dumb it up for her, "T" for Tom and "G" for go! After another wait to see if she carried it in stock, finally they did carry it. I asked for pricing and they told me they could not give out prices over the phone! WT****...so I asked her "really? so you are telling me that I have to drive out from Henderson, over 25 miles to know the price?" she said "yeah." Un-freaking believable!!! I bet anything it's one of those places that does not tell you how much things are so when you visit them you find out an item that is $100 is $500 there! Anything to fish you to try to make you come out. Would not do any business with them. Very poor customer service!!!
1 I was ripped of by this Hector/Jose sales associate when he sold me a canon dslr package that would have cost me between $1,100-$1,400 but charged me $2,697.00 instead on 4/26/2014...i had reported them to BBB, FTC, Las Vegas Consumer Affairs, State of Nevada Office of the Attorney General, local police and my credit card company...never ever step foot in this store for anything...
