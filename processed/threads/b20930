3 I came here to get some filling for some new pillowcases I bought. They had a selection of pillow fillings, from harder ones to softer ones, and the guy was helpful enough to give me the small quantity I needed and at a reasonable price.   It's nothing fancy inside  or outside in any stretch of the imagination, but has bed fillings and mattress fillings as well and well gets the job done which is what you want form a shop like this. Plus if you are ever going to as adventurous as my flatmate to make a giant beanie then this is the place to get the filling.
3 What can I say - this place is called the foam centre. It does foam. And seat recushioning. I'm not going to be able to make this review cool.  Honestly, I came here because the sofa in my flat had collapsed and we were trying to make some bodged repairs. The foam centre is the place to do this - its kind of what it specialises in, along with things like matresses and lots and lots of those tiny little polestyrene balls that get everywhere for bean bags.  I dont know what else to say. It wasnt expensive (at least, i dont think so - i really have no other referance) and it was pretty quick (again, no reference). Service was good as well.
4 I was so curious about this place, was peoples desire for foamy products enough to constitute a Centre?  The place was mobbed.   I saw 2 women debating in the corner wither to buy the cream or the white foam, for the INSIDE of the mattress. The man at the counter was a foam god, answering every silly question I had. I wonder how comfy his bed is...  I don't know if there is a genuine market for a place like this, but they seem to be doing well.
