4 My son and I always go here for lunch! I really like it, but you know like any other typical PE wha are you gonna get? Orange chicken, haha. The girl server is super nice and hella quick, and the cashier is also sweet.  The lo mein is yummy as is the chicken with green beans! Jyst thinking about it right now is making me hungry!   We will go back whenever we're down there!
5 Just love this place as do my kids. Servers are super friendly and fast :) :)
3 Usually empty on Saturdays for lunch. Quick and easy service and the kids love it. There is certainly better Chinese to be had, but for a simple and quick lunch, this place is clean and efficient.
