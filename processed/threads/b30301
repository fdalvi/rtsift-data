5 I've been going to Dr. Chen for over 10 years and can enthusiastically recommend her. She is capable and caring and is a consummate professional. Going to the dentist isn't usually anyone's idea of 'fun', but she makes it tolerable. That's about as good as it gets.....
5 Love Dr. Barbara Chen and staff.  We've been her patients for years and she's always taken great care of us.  Definitely recommend her as your dentist.
