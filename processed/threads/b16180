5 Ok, I have to tell you that EVERY time I come to Vegas I stop here before I even check into my hotel! Ben the owner is amazing. He always has something new to share with me and give great recommendations. He has liquors in sizes that you can't find everywhere for awesome prices and his accent is as lovely as his customer service. He always gives me something complimentary although I usually end up spending upwards of $200 each time I go...what can I say I travel with a group! It's VEGAS!!! Enjoy!!
5 I was in Vegas the week before Christmas for a birthday party/girls weekend and I was the first to arrive so I made the liquor store run.  I just happened to find this place and I was more than happy with the selection, price, and customer service.  Ben (the owner) was the sweetest guy and he suggested a more inexpensive brand of flavored vodka that was actually way better than Smirnoff, which was what I was going to buy.  After making my purchases, he even carried everything out to the car and loaded it up for me.  (I bought the Vodka, a 12 pack of corona, mixers, and energy drinks).  He was super nice and super honest and I will definitely stop at this store every time I am in Vegas!

1 What a rip-off!!! Bought a bottle of Kraken Rum, paid $10 too much. $28.99 for 750ml whereas one can buy it for $18.99 at the Wal-Mart on Eastern Avenue next to the airport. Lesson learned!
5 I'm giving this place primarily 5 stars for the honest and outgoing owner and this place deserves to stand out above other nearby liquor stores. He went out of his way to make sure we got what we wanted without getting ripped off. He was extremely friendly and tried to make sure we got a good value for our money. He even told us when some of his products were above average price and what a good alternative for the money was. I looked up the prices online and he was not lying. It was great to have an honest salesman!  The prices are pretty average for the country, but better then you will find anywhere else this close to the strip. Unless you are planning on spending spending over 100 dollars you will probably save more by going here than the gas and time alone to drive to your next best options like Total Wine or Costco which are over 30 minutes from the strip.  Be warned there are inconsistencies in pricing vs the average. Some things are a great value, like Tito's Vodka. Some things (as you can tell from the earlier Kraken review), not so much. My advice go here and talk to the man. He genuinely seems to want his customers to get good bargans and only carries products he has to sell above market so that he can have the selection everyone wants.
5 Great service. Knowledgable owner Huge selection Fair prices
4 I don't know the gentleman's name that was working on Saturday, 4/12, but he was the kindest, most informed liquor store owner I think I've ever encountered. He was all about saving us some money while ensuring we got some quality liquor for our fun in Vegas. His service was worth the time of leaving this comment. Kudos!
