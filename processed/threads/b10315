3 Used the coupon for the free roastburger at this location and the manager let my coupon slide even though I guess I didn't print coupon the right way.  She was telling me some guy walked in there earlier and tried to use 8 coupons for himself.  Was he planning on eating 8 roastburgers and 8 soft drinks in one sitting?  Crazy bastard.    Its just a roast beef sandwich dressed up in burgers clothing.  Ketchup and roast beef don't taste that great together imo.  Bun was good though.  My wife got the bacon and cheddar and thought it was fantastic but I felt pretty unsatisfied with my All-American.
3 We frequently visit this Arbys. At  least once a week. Drive thru is quick and painless. It seems like the jr roast beef get smaller and smaller every week. We still love the roast beef and this arbys never screws up my order.
4 I stop by a lot when I need a quick meal. They never get my order wrong, or it never takes very long to get food here. It's always quiet and clean inside the dining area.
4 The only problem with this place is the need to make Betty the manager
1 If I could rate 0 stars I would overwhelmed and overworked staff management obviously pinching pennies by not having enough help in an obviously busy store resulting in no service which is horrible customer service walked out without ordering and will not go back their corporation spends millions advertising a new sandwich but you can't order it whats wrong with this picture
