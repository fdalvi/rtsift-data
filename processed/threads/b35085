4 My new favorite place for some good ole' fashion fried chicken. Good flavor, and cooked just right. Chicken combos, tenders, honey butter biscuits, red beans and rice, jalape√±o poppers, french fries, onion rings, fried mac and cheese wedges, mashed potatoes and gravy.
2 CLOSED. Went by and it is no longer there, called headquarters and they have no active locations in AZ.
