1 Don't go here they tried to charge me 300.00 for one day and they only had mini vans. I told him he didn't take in the fact that I was between the ages of 21-24 and he said that he would waive that fee. Of course he was going to waive the underage renter's fee because he wanted to make me pay 300.00 for a gas guzzling mini van.They were also going to try and charge me an extra 150.00 because I wanted to drop the car off in Reno. They said it was because they had to put it on their fleet. Yea right better believe I walked out their doors with the quickness.   This place is a straight joke! Don't go here.
5 Returning my car, great experiance as usual.
