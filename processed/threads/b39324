5 My new favorite dessert place! Money well worth it. Reminds me of Chikalicous in East Village, New York
4 Opening day of Sweets Raku was pretty great. Love the simple, modern decor and that you get a high end experience, for a somewhat reasonable price. You can tell that they put a lot of thought into everything, and I love little details like the curved glasses, their utensil holders and that they made a spoon rest out spare wall tiles.  Servers are incredibly attentive and friendly - she actually remembered me from the day before when I popped in since John Curtas (mistakenly) said they were unofficially open and serving from the 5th.   They got their liquor license quicker than expected, so they don't have wine available yet (assume that's coming soon), but they do offer yummy Illy coffee and some tempting tea selections. I went with just an iced latte $4.50, and the coffee ice cubes inside were a nice surprise since the drinks stays cold without getting watered down.   For now, your only option is to do the three course $19 prix fixe menu w/ an amuse, choice of 3 main desserts, and petits fours. FYI maybe this will change, but it's currently an additional $12 to share - you do get a 2nd amuse and petits fours with a shared dessert. Instead of sharing, I'd suggest just paying the extra $7 so you get another main dessert as well.   The menu is entirely edible - printed on rice paper and served with a raspberry sauce for dipping. Even the holder ring is made of pretty pulled sugar. Honestly, it wasn't particularly delish, but it's a cool concept to be able to eat your menu.   Amuse came out quickly - it was a really refreshing mango sorbet with mint jelly. It was smooth and basically like eating a fresh mango. The jelly was minty enough that you could taste it, but not overwhelming.   My neighbors had the strawberry/banana dessert and loved it, but I can't resist chocolate, so I went with Apollo for my main - chocolate and framboise (raspberry) mousse. The desserts are assembled to order before your eyes surprisingly quickly.     The signature for Japanese desserts seems to be that they're never too sweet - it may end up being bland to some people, but I really like that you can focus on the flavor vs just tasting the sweetness of sugar. I love mousses, but they usually seem so heavy and rich that you feel like crap after having them. This was somehow really light with the chocolate and raspberry perfectly balanced. I kind felt like there was too much going on w/ all the other components, but it made for a beautiful dish - almost too pretty to eat.   The petits fours was a mini chocolate lava cake w/ little raspberry and passion fruit marshmellows on the side, and some random raisins too. It's pretty small, about 2" diameter but it's a petits fours, so you should kind of expect that. Don't expect your typical lava cake, because again, they go light on the sugar so it seemed super chocolatey to me. Kind of like a good quality dark chocolate vs a cheap hershey bar. It was a great way to end the meal. The timing of that last course was a little off - it took a while to arrive since they had to bake it, but she did mention up front that it would take time.  I actually went by myself because nobody wanted to spend $20 on dessert, but it wasn't awkward since everything came out relatively fast and sitting at the counter has kind of a more communal feel. So I did end up chatting with strangers a bit. It was overall a fun and fancy dessert experience without being the least bit pretentious.   I can't really say these were mind blowing desserts, and if you prefer really sweet things, this may not be the place for you. But for the service level, and the fact that they're basically making art before your eyes, I think it's worth the $19 price. It's about the experience, and it's definitely a great date spot. The server even chased me down in the parking lot to give me an opening day giftbag with a chocolate cake, mini madelines and an almond cookie. She was too cute.    I don't know that this is really a negative, but I was a little surprised that there was really nothing asian about any of the desserts - I kind of expected more Japanese influenced flavors like matcha and yuzu. But the menu is supposed to constantly change, so  who knows for the future
5 I love Raku and it holds a special place in my heart for many reasons...and now a Sweets Raku? Cuh-razy! I went on the second day they opened thinking they'd be extremely busy on opening day.  It's in the same parking lot as Monta, Raku, Trattoria Nakamura-ya, Big Wong and the future home of SnowFlake Shavery (FKA Frost Bites)...it's unmarked and right next door to the unclearly marked Kabuto.  If you find a big silver spoon, you've found Sweets Raku!  My Asian GPS got me confused last night so I hope that helps.  The place is nice, bright, clean and modern-looking...I love it!  There's a "wall" of bottled water separating the entrance from the dining area.  I'd recommend sitting at the bar so you can watch the magnificent angels of dessert heaven do their thing. The oven is right in front of you so you can watch them bake. At first, I thought it was just a prop because it's soooo clean.  The sole unisex bathroom (marked by a red and a green apple) is so cute. I spent a lot of time in there admiring the kawaii-ness of it. The servers and chefs were in all white with Marimekko aprons...and they have Marimekko drink coasters too. Reminds me of a Crate and Barrel catalog.   So, you want to know about the food?  As somebody with such a sweet tooth celebrating my birth month, I had no reason not to love this place.  The drink menu alone wowed me.  They have Illy coffee and Lupicia Tea (Japanese for awesome flavored tea!!!).  I got a pot of Strawberry & Vanilla green tea...oh my, I can drink this all day and all night.  Shawn tried the Champagne Rose black tea...it was ok.  We were enjoying dipping our edible menu in raspberry sauce...good thing we already placed our order before we ate the menu! "I ate the menu now I don't know what I want. May I have another one?" The $19 prix fixe menu includes amuse, a choice of dessert (Marriage, Apollo or Veil) and petit four...for an additional $7, you can do a wine pairing with your dessert.  We got a glass of Rosa Regale with our Marriage and Apollo.  Amuse: Strawberry sorbet with mint jelly.  Nice contrasting colors of red and green.  The cold strawberry sorbet was mildly sweet and very slightly tart - cleverly meshed with the cool taste of mint jelly. 5/5  Apollo: Raspberry mousse and a thin layer of custard in between two layers of chocolate mousse topped with fresh raspberries and Earl Grey tea ice cream.  Also on the plate: chocolate ribbon, raspberry puree, chocolate ganache,  chocolate rice squares, meringue and crushed pistachios. 5/5  Marriage: Strawberry mousse, banana custard, sponge cake, fresh berries, white chocolate and whipped cream with gold leaf. My favorite part of this dessert was the banana custard. 5/5  Petit Fours: Chocolate lava cake lightly dusted with powdered sugar, raspberry marshmallows and passion fruit marshmallow. Warm chocolate cake with hot chocolate gushing out as you poke the middle with a spoon...everybody has had this before but what's different about this were the fruity marshmallows.  4/5  For coming in on opening week, we got goodie bags with madelines, chocolate cake and almond brittle...which I ate for breakfast! All the desserts are very Japanese: mildly sweet with contrasting flavors but has an element that somehow makes it a happy union...beautifully plated.  I'd have to come back to try Veil (stuffed custard pie) next time.  Also, service was very friendly and attentive.  It was definitely the perfect way to end my evening.
2 Let's make this clear before I begin...I LOVE RAKU...LOVE!  That's why i was so excited to hear about this dessert bar opening.  I thought it was a fresh idea to have in Vegas.  Like the other reviews the restaurant itself is spot on.  All white...great plates, glasses, tea pots, tea cups, silverware, they have a modern twist on them all.  I was so close in snagging a spoon for my ice cream at home. LOL!  Restroom was very cool, but I don't know how long that remoted controlled toilet will last and I figure someone sooner or later will think the sink is a trash can, but whatever it's still very cool.  Now, let me get to the part why i gave it 2 stars.  Lets get to the desserts...  Amuse: Strawberry sorbet with mint jelly.  This was a strawberry sorbet you could get anywhere nothing spectaculor about it.  The mint jelly had no flavor and I feel was simply there for texture.  Not impressed.  Apollo: Raspberry mousse and a thin layer of custard in between two layers of chocolate mousse topped with fresh raspberries.  Again, I did not see anything great of this dish just a typical dessert you can get anywhere.  Marriage: Strawberry mousse, banana custard, sponge cake, fresh berries, white chocolate and whipped cream with gold leaf. This looked awesome, but tasted again like any other dessert.  Truthfully the sponge cake was dry and not that moist.  Petit Four: Chocolate lava cake lightly dusted with powdered sugar, raspberry marshmallows and passion fruit marshmallow. Cool idea with the flavored marshmallows, but the chocolate lava cake was too bitter and nothing on the plate to balance it.    I must add that I did think making the menu being edible was fun and creative.    I did receive the goodie bag and I have to say that I was more impressed with the goodie bag than what I had in the restaurant.  The madelines were kinda of dry, but the almond brittle was really good and the chocolate cake was very moist...tasted like there was fruit or something inside and the chocolate top had a nice snap to it.    Based on the quality of Raku I had extrememly high expectations and maybe that's where it all went wrong.  Presentation is great, but is the flavor or presentation better than say going to Jean Phillip...No!  These were really just typical french style desserts.  I was expecting something more creative from Raku using more inspired japanese or asian ingredients.
5 So good we ate the menu!  I've always wanted to say that.  Except in this case, we actually DID eat the menu! Cuz it's edible....there's even a dipping sauce for it!  This is a very special place where dessert are treated like a complete meal.  Fixed price. 3 courses. Complete with wine-pairing.  Needless to say, the deserts are works of visual delight, and inventive flavoring....just look at the photos. The service is very gentle and attentive with every course clearly explained.  And if that isn't enough, I'm told that foie-gras and other decadent goodies are coming to the menu soon! Can't wait for that.  The strip mall where Sweets Raku is located is now the Asian culinary-center of the universe, with Raku, Monta Ramen, Japanese Curry Zen, Big Wong, Nakamura-Ya and Kabuto.  You get the idea: eat at one of those places, then stroll over to Sweets Raku to finish off a memorable evening.
4 Sweets is a bit of a conundrum. The service is fantastically friendly. The decor is super nice. And the desserts are carefully and entertainingly prepared pieces of food art. I was happy throughout, but in the end I left feeling underwhelmed.  If you go, you will likely enjoy yourselves and experience tasty delights. And you should go. If $20-ish for a three course dessert meal doesn't make your wallet/purse cry, then you should definitely go and have an enjoyable time.  On the other hand. If you've experienced other high concept "dessert bars" like Chickalicious in New York (let's not kid anyone, Sweets is nearly a direct emulation of Chickalicious down to the amuse bouche and the white walls) then you might find yourself a bit underwhelmed at the end like me.  But all in all, Sweets is a fantastic addition to our town's growing oeuvre of culinary experiences. But, I probably won't be going back. Confused yet?
2 Not impressed.  First of all, finding their place is kind of a dilemma. There is no sign whatsoever that indicates "Sweets Raku". After sticking my head in the door and asking if this was Sweet Raku, was only then that I was at the right place. Heck, I even took a pic of the giant shiny aluminum spoon to the right of the entrance door so I can remember where they are. What really stands out are the many bottles of different water with ph levels I assume? I forgot to ask them about it but you cant miss it. The place is small, I would say good for about 20 people?   Now for the menu. You get it rolled secured with a bracelet type ring. Your server comes around, pulls the menu out, unrolls it, pours some type of raspberry sauce on your plate, and says you can eat the menu and the holder with dipping it in the sauce as an option.   At the time of this review, it was a pre set price of 19 dollars for a set appetizer, choice of a main course, and then another set dessert. Our server said you couldn't share unless you added another main course for 12 dollars more. Can we say, ripoff?  So we went with the Apollo and the Marriage. I would have loved to describe all what we had but I am kind of shocked at the amount of money we had to pay just to have dessert. It was decent but nothing to be excited about.  The total of our bill came up to 33 dollars and some change. All for just dessert? Our original plan was just to share the already ridiculous price of 19 but was forced to order another main entrée for another 12 bucks? Sure the décor and the bathroom was nice but overpriced dessert was definitely not our thing. I don't think we'll be coming back any time soon.
5 I'll join the hype! 5 star for this unique dessert experience alone.  We hit up Sweets Raku during their opening week - specifically on Friday evening.  It was about a 30 minute wait for our party of two.  We were already invested, and decided to hold out...especially if we were going to be seated at the counter.  (This is the place you want to be seated at, by the way.)  The menu is prix fixe at $19 - you get an Amuse, a Choice of Dessert, and a Petit Four.  You can only share with another person by adding either another entree (Choice of Dessert) or an Amuse and a Petit Four.  We opted for another Choice of Dessert.  An additional $7 if you would like to do a dessert wine pairing.  One of the things I love is the attention to detail and care.  Even before we were seated, the staff are certain to make sure everything is in place before they will allow you to sit down.  The hostess was bent down on the floor sweeping with a dustpan even!  Besides the obvious water bottle display as soon as you walk through the door, it's actually a wine cellar if you can believe it!  They didn't expect to get their liquor license in time, so they filled it up with the different color labeled bottles of water in the meantime.  But ultimately, it's supposed to be displaying wine.   The waitress hands us a menu wrapped up in a ring and you can immediately tell there's something different about the menu.  It's edible rice paper and a ring made from pulled sugar.  This isn't your average dessert joint.  They pour raspberry sauce for you to dip your paper in to enjoy, so don't start chomping on the paper just yet.  (We even got a new menu and ring to take home.)  Even the cutlery and water pitcher is something to take notice of.  * Amuse: Mango Sorbet with Mint Jelly - Our first thought about mint jelly was rack of lamb and we were a bit concerned about that.  This was far from the case.  The mint was very subtle and the mango was full of flavor.  A nice way to start our little journey.  * Choice of Dessert: Marriage "Strawberry & Banana" - Looking at the little masterpiece in front of you, it's as if have a miniature candy showpiece has appeared.  Delicious white chocolate, flecks of gold, fresh berries, banana cream, strawberry sorbet...it's just pretty and yummy to eat.  * Choice of Dessert: Apollo "Chocolate & Raspberry Mousse" - Another showpiece before your eyes, this time with this wonderful Earl Grey ice cream that rests on top (Oh how I wish I could order a huge bowl of that!).  Little accents like the meringue and the chocolate rice cookie squares were among my faves of the dish.  * Petit Four - Chocolate molten cake with marshmallows made from passion fruit and raspberry.  I enjoyed this dessert but this third part was not the favorite of the Husband's.  He really enjoyed the other courses more.  One of the best parts about sitting at the counter is watching the actual pastry chef up front and center.  Yes, she's one of the young girls working so hard to make every dessert look absolutely beautiful.  She's straight from Japan, having only arrived in the States a couple of months ago and apparently she's been trained by some of the best.  We asked how often they plan on rotating the menu and ultimately, they said they hope to do every week.  But for now, we'll see.  They also hope to have five entrees to choose from in the Choice of Dessert section.  We also got a goodie bag with yummy desserts to take home during their opening week, so I got to enjoy Raku all week long at home.  We're liking Sweets Raku and it'll be one of those places we recommend and take out-of-town guests.  This kind of experience isn't for everyone as it's quite drawn out and there's a reason they ask, "How was your experience?".  (Be sure to experience the restroom too!)  If you aren't into desserts, especially ones that take time and detail, this isn't your place.  They get busy in the later evenings but are slow when they first open in the afternoon.  So come early if you don't want to wait since this place only holds about 20+ diners at a time.
5 Should get 6 stars based upon the overall experience and tremendous attention to detail.  Another huge winner for the plaza.  This place could easily be in the best neighborhoods of London, Paris or Tokyo.
5 I have been waiting for sweets raku to be opened since a year ago. I visited this place with my husband on the second week after grand opening. We came here with full stomach and high expectation after dinner. I have to say it was worth the wait! We shared the pre-fixed menu ($19) and ordered momo (peach) and champagne rose tea ($6). (FYI, they charge $5 additional for sharing pre-fixed menu and $7 extra for dessert wine pairing !) We had seating at the desert bar and got to see how the magic happened. It was quite a show to see how pastry chef assembled all the pastries into art.   Amuse - Mango sorbet with mint jelly and leaf I never had mango with mint together before. I was surprised how well these two flavors went together, Sorbet had a thick texture, and I felt like I had real mango in my mouth. Mint jelly kinda refresh my palate in the end.  Marriage - sponge cake with banana cream and strawberries I liked this dish a lot! Sponge cake tasted really moist and soft. Banana cream has just right amount of sweetness.   Apollo - Chocolate and framboise mousse cake I loved the earl grey ice cream on top of the this chocolate mousse cake. It was definitely the highlight of this dish. Also, the strawberry rice stick was very airy and delish!  Petits Fours - mini lava cake lava cake was super chocolatey and went very well with raisins and passion fruit marshmallows.   Our waitress told me that we have the option to order a la carte and it would be $12 each dish. It would definitely be a good option for people just want to have little sweet ending after a full meal from other restaurants. She also told me that sweets raku is gonna change their menu next week. (new items like apple pie and chestnut cream cake... and maybe foie gras dishes) I got really excited after hearing that!! Everyone knows me knows how much I love foie gras hahaaa!! Next time, I will come back to try their cheese plate with dessert wine pairing (illiskillin ice wine) and maybe foie gras dishes!!!!
5 Great place!  Staff was very friendly and very helpful explaining the intricate desserts.   I have been there twice already, and they've only been open since August 6.  I was there a couple of days after they opened and they even gave me a dessert bag to take home!  I went a second time with friends from Boston and New York and they enjoyed it also.  The guys in Boston are jealous that there's no place in Boston like this.  The place is pristine white.  If you go, try to get a seat at the bar so you can watch them assemble your desserts.  Yes, desserts.  Three courses that they tell me will change seasonally.  They are flavorful without being overly sweet.    I was speaking to the manager and she told me that getting a seat is easier in the daytime.  When it gets busy in the evening, expect about a 30 minute wait.  30 minutes is acceptable for such a unique dining experience.  I'm expecting a few friends to visit Las Vegas in the next few months and I'm bringing all of them here during their stay.
5 HATE  Nothing.  DISLIKE  Bottles of water out front were never offered as an option.  LIKE  The location (next to other local faves). The wine pairing. The water container. The service. The edible menu. The first (sorbet with mint jelly) and third course (petit four).  LOVE  The clean design. The presentation. The dessert prix fixe. The Marriage. Mt. Fuji. The Ringo. The bathroom.
4 This place is great for foodies. very unique and cleaver. you start off by eating the menu. This place is only three weeks old and last night on a Wednesday it was pack.  Everything is poetic, and very Japanese, which is very cool . I had the apple pie , very good, I was just wishing there was more apple in the pie. The chocolate mousse that my girlfriend  had was perfect.  I give this place 4.5  out of 5 .
5 A few weeks after my first visit, I went to Sweets Raku again since they have new menu items.  I took my sister here so we can try Mt. Fuji, Veil and Ringo. As for the tea, we tried Tokio (sweet berries green tea) and Sakurambo (Japanese cherry black tea) with our dessert prix fixe. I have officially tried all their desserts, yay!  Amuse: Mango sorbet with mint jelly.  The mango sorbet was a little bit tangy but very delicious with the mint jelly. I had the strawberry sorbet the first time. Both flavors are very good since they're two of my favorite fruits. 5/5  Mt. Fuji: Spongecake, chestnuts with chestnut cream, chestnut tuile, chestnut and chocolate. I grew up liking chestnuts and chestnuts in dessert isn't common in Western cuisine so, this was a no-brainer.  5/5  Ringo: Apple pie with honey ice cream, white chocolate dusted with cinnamon. There's a sugar candy shaped like an apple that has cream inside. An American classic got exciting again. Break the candy apple with your spoon for cream to put on your apple pie. The apple pie itself isn't sweet so eat it with honey ice cream. 5/5   Veil: Stuffed custard pie is what i says on the edible menu so it doesn't sound so interesting. I really was hesitant to order this because how exciting is custard pie? But I must say, I saved the best for last. What you get is flaky pastry with custard on top and in the middle...on top of berry cream swimming in compote all wrapped in a web made of sugar. The Apollo (chocolate and raspberry mousse) is a safe and obvious choice for chocoholics like me but I stepped out of my comfort zone and I'm glad I did. This is the best item they have on their menu. Confetti and glitter! 5/5  Excellent service as usual and our server, Kazue remembered me from my first visit. I'm still in love with this place. It makes me feel like a kid again. Genius! I think I might be addicted to this place now. The best way to end my birth month. Remember to join their e-mailing list.  Sit at the bar (if it's available) so you can watch the action and talk to the chefs. It's $19 for the prix fixe menu (sorbet + your choice of dessert + petit four) or $12 for just dessert (Apollo, Marriage, Veil, Mt. Fuji or Ringo). If you get Apollo wit your prix fixe, you'll get cheesecake instead of the lava cake. For descriptions of the other dessert items, read my previous review.  *Please do not copy and paste any parts of my review - write your own. Kthnxbye!
5 Omfg. This place was so much fun. Like Japan's version of willy wonka's delicious factory. The menu is edible and comes with a dipping sauce. Everything was beyond delicious and the whole place smelled like what I hope heaven smells like. I'm quite certain I will be going to heaven because I am awesome. Until that day comes, I will be going here. Often.
5 Sweets Raku is the brainchild of Mitsuo Endo of the Abriya Raku fame (a 3-time James Beard Award nominee). The concept of this restaurant is a dessert bar, where you come in, order off a prefix menu, or order the desserts à la carte. Being a dessert bar, you will be served desserts only (but I've heard that they also have a cheese plate). After hearing some interesting comments about this dessert bar, I went with a buddy after my SnowFlake Shavery fix to get some dessert.  SR is located in the Seoul Plaza on Spring Mountain Road and Jones. It actually sits across the same building complex as Raku. Walking inside, you'll notice an amazing display of bottles of water and other refreshments built into a see-through wall. The clean, modern, and white interior give you a sense that the people who created this restaurant really wanted to give you an unforgettable experience. There is an open kitchen, and around it sits a bar with around 15 seats where you can watch all the desserts being made right in front of your eyes! There are also tables, but if you have the opportunity, sit at the bar and enjoy the show.  The pastry chef is Mio who is in charge of the kitchen. She's been a pastry chef for over a decade in Japan, but you would never guess due to her youthful appearance. The server dropped off a menu that was rolled up in a sugar ribbon ring. After ordering our drinks and the prix fix menu, we waited for Mio to start. The menu is also edible, and I thought that was a real neat and fun idea to be able to eat a menu!  It didn't have a taste at all, which is good because I would have gagged if it tasted like paper. The server then brought us our drinks.  - Americano coffee: They use the Illy brand coffee, and it was bold and well made.  The Amuse/First course came up first:  - Strawberry and Mint: A strawberry sorbet with mint jelly, with a fresh sprig of micromint. The strawberry sorbet had a nice strawberry flavor. The texture was sort of weird for me, it wasn't icy... but I guess it wasn't as smooth as I would have liked.  It's hard to describe. On the other hand, the texture of the mint jelly was well done, but I couldn't really taste the mint flavor that much.  The main entrees then arrived:  - Mt. Fuji: This was a play on the classic French dessert, the Mont Blanc. This was my favorite dessert of the night. The chestnut cream was amazingly light and had a smooth chestnut flavor. The cake was moist, and the chestnut glace complimented the whole dish. The presentation was also pretty cool.  - Apollo: Chocolate and raspberry mousse on top of chocolate cake, Earl grey tea ice cream, raspberry meringue, chocolate bases, and raspberry sauce. I thought the mousse's were all well made and so was the chocolate cake. The chocolate squares around the plate and the Earl Grey Tea ice cream were my favorite part of the dish. The ice cream tasted exceptionally well with the pink peppercorns that were ground on top. I thought the meringue and raspberry sauce were O.K. This was my least favorite dessert, I thought, flavor wise... it was just too safe.  The petit fours/Last Courses arrived:  - Parmesan cheesecake with oranges: I loved the concept of this dish. It is like eating two different courses in one dish. By itself, the cheesecake is very savory, and I thought that this would make a nice appetizer on a restaurant menu. But then, after eating the cheesecake together with the oranges, it complimented the savoriness of the cheesecake perfectly, and it became a dessert again! I found this to be absolutely fascinating.  - Chocolate Fondant with marshmallows: The warm chocolate molten cake was well executed with a cakey outer shell, and a warm molten interior. It was a well balanced cake. My favorite accompaniment of the night had to go to the lemon marshmallows. They had a bright, strong,  lemon flavor, and they tasted just like a lemon curd! I thought the raspberry marshmallows were lacking in raspberry flavor, but the texture was good.  The service throughout the night was top notch. The server knew when we needed drinks refilled, and cleared our plates at the right time. She was super friendly and knowledgeable and engaged with us enough, but not overly smothering.  Dining at Sweets Raku brought an old smile to my face. It brought me back to those pre-"Great Recession" days. I remembered when the properties on the Strip were in competition with each other... not money-wise like they are now...but quality wise. Back then, F&B programs were trying to think of ways to create unforgettable experiences to their guests. Now, it's all about the bottom line, which is why we only see now burger joints, bars, and steak houses popping up, with inconsistent service everywhere. There are some flubs in this place, but you can find flaws at Raku, Joel Robuchon, The French Laundry, etc. But, this place deserves 5 stars, because.. it's the thought that counts.   Kudos to Chef Endo and Chef Mio, true artisans of their profession!!!
4 During the visit to Raku in Jun, I was so excited to know the owner of Raku would open Sweet Raku in August. So when i went to Vegas for Labor Day weekend, Sweet Raku was on my top list to visit.  I got there around 5:30 pm, no customers except for 2 of us. The decoration is very nice with white carrara marble for the bar and the wine cellar. It's nice sitting on the bar and seeing the chefs making the desserts.  They didn't have Ringo ( pie apple) so we ordered Marriage (Strawberry & Banana) and Apollo ( Chocolate & Raspberry mousse).  It was delicious. Apollo is definitely for chocolate lover, it has very strong chocolate taste. We both got wine to pair with the dessert. Mine was kinda sweet. I should have got the tea instead.
5 Cool experience...good food, excellent presentation, fast service!    The only complaint could be about the prices IMO, but if you come in knowing you are going to spend $20 plus tax, tip, drinks etc on dessert, it's not TOO bad.  Teas are around $5, and most flavors are very exotic.  The Rosa Regale ($7) was pretty light handed...I've had this wine many times, just WISH there was more in my glass @ $7.  First of all, Cool presentation with the menu...all edible!  The "paper" itself and the holder are all edible lol.  Started off with the Strawberry Sorbet and Mint Jelly...simple and clean taste. Definitely a palate cleanser...good overall.  The Apollo: Chocolate and Raspberry Mousse, Raspberries and Earl Grey Tea Ice Cream. Yummy flavors and cool presentation.   Really liked the mousse and ice cream combination.  Marriage: Strawberry mousse and banana custard hiding inside the sponge cake, fresh berries, white chocolate garnish with gold leaf and sugar decorations. I thought this dish was the best out of the bunch, with the light fluffy sponge cake and custard combination.  And to finish, the Petit Four: Chocolate Lava Cake with Flavored Marshmallows. This was good as well...you can smell these as soon as you walk inside! LOL.  So overall, it is a little spendy for dessert, but if you sit back and look at the presentation and the love put into the food combinations and flavors, it's money well spent every few months or so.  Pics!  :
5 All you need to know is that you can EAT THE MENU. No literally, it's made of rice paper. Boom.
5 Friend of ours hosted a late evening (well middle of night) dessert experience.   I'm not much of a sweets person but I have to say this place does it very well.    Each dish was like a work of art.  No one wanted to actually dig in and we often just sat there staring at it until our waitress have us a little encouragement to just eat it.   I enjoyed everything I ate as all the flavors were very subtle and unlike anything I've had before.     If you're ever in LV and want to venture out - I'd recommend stopping in
4 This place is really adorable. I love the décor! It makes me feel like I'm in an anime spot! The bathroom is also pretty fun to just visit. The sink is really interesting! I love artsy type of cool and confusing décor. It is confusing as I noticed someone threw garbage into the sink. LoL! The service is very attentive and friendly. our waitress explained and answered all of our questions with a smile of her face. My bf and I ended up sharing a tasting. The menu is edible....and it tastes like paper. For some reason I thought it would taste like white chocolate...I don't know why, but it was far from it. It was seriously like eating paper and raspberry sauce. The Amuse was pretty good, and Veil was really delicious. The Petit Four with the Lava Cake was interestingly good, No complaints. In the end this place is just really great for the experience.
1 Dessert was good.  Plating was excellent.  The experience was novel.  This could have been easily a 4.5 star review, but the restaurant policy turned me off.  One of my friends that dined with us was full from dinner and did not wish to have any desserts.  She ordered a glass of wine and declined to order anything else.  We were then told that the restaurant REQUIRES the patron to order a dessert.  She was then practically forced to order something (a cheese plate) in order for her to stay, even though she physically could not eat anything more.  It was not like she didn't order anything.  A glass of wine (equivalent of a 1.5 shot) for $10 a glass isn't cheap.  The tea was too strong, over steeped or too much tea leaves.  I've never had Jasmine tea that literally overpowered my taste buds.  In any case, I will not be returning there.  I will definitely not be recommending anyone to this restaurant.
5 Wow, just wow. I have never left a restaurant feeling so happy before. I will start off by saying this is out of this world! Everything is edible. Everything. The menu comes paired with a delicious raspberry sauce! Amazing.  My boyfriend and I went with the three course dessert option and it was fantastic. The first course is a delicious mango sorbet with mint jelly. Incredible. The second course is entirely up to you. Mine was the Mt. Fuji and while it was a large serving size, I could not bring myself to put my fork down. It was so good. The cream that comes on top is something I wish I could keep in my pantry and eat all of the time. My boyfriend got the marriage and it was a twist on strawberry shortcake. The cake was moist and the berries were very fresh and juicy. Finally, the last course is a fresh baked chocolate cake with a liquid chocolate center. YUM! It comes with raspberry and passionfruit marshmallows and they were the more fantastic marshmallows I have ever had. I would go back just for those.  All in all, this place is the most unique and wonderful restaurant I have ever had the pleasure of visiting. It will certainly become a place I frequently visit.  Ps, the staff are so sweet and friendly. I felt so welcomed and it was a great atmosphere to enjoy some of the most delicious desserts I have ever had.
5 Well I am beyond impressed. The wow factor here belongs to the exec pastry Chef Mio from Japan, who creates the delicious works of art! Both Mr. B and I were in awe with the work she did on a wedding cake that she was working on when we walked in.  We knew right then we were in for a treat getting to sit at the counter and watch her make our desserts.   This innovative restaurant focuses on dessert only that is served in courses thru their set Prix Fixe menu (1st amuse, 2nd Entree/main dessert, 3rd petit four)  or you can order the feature dessert items ala carte as well.   Rant: We witnessed some guests that had an issue regarding the price ($19) + no sharing on Prix Fixe menu. Seriously you're going to squawk forking a couple dollars more? For what you get, that's an exceptional deal!  If you dine at some of the upscale restaurants you will pay the equivalent for just a single dessert. (Mr. B reminded me about the time I dragged him to MO for the tiny cupcakes and 1 pot of tea $50..lol) Too bad for the people that walked out because they couldn't get around the no share policy. Your date missed out on an awesome dining experience. (and you lost your baller status Mr. I Drive a  90k+ car)   Back to raving:  Even though we were full from dinner and shaved snow as it was,  I managed to get the Prix Fixe with Apollo as my choice dessert and Mr. B just got the Veil ala carte. Dessert was superb!  Especially made us much more appreciative of it when we got to watch Chef Mio carefully prepare each of the components and details of the desserts with such precision. Watch the procedure when she makes the bird nest topper for the Veil. It's crazy!  This place was a bit difficult to find. We came here initially to have shaved snow desserts over at Snowflake Shavery.  I knew this place was close by but couldn't see any sign glancing around Seoul Plaza. Finally we spotted the silver spoon to the right of the storefront. Thanks to Roger T for replying to my SOS quick for that visual cue . Ambience calm and clean, quite a contrast from the hectic parking lot. Our server was really sweet and friendly.  She also helped with being my translator when talking with Chef Mio. Loved our dessert dining experience here. Pretty unique. I would suggest this place for date night! We will  definitely will return as well.
5 Being a long time fan of Chef Mitsuo Endo and Raku since day one, I eagerly awaited the arrival of its sister, Sweets Raku, which a few people compare in concept to ChikaLicious in NYC but I must say I was hesitant about visiting right away, as I was under the impression that desserts were gonna have a more Japanese influence such as the flavors of Suzuya Pastries and Crepes, but that was not the case. The first reviews and pictures didn't really convince me to try Sweets Raku just yet, so I decide to hold out a little longer until menu items changed to see what else was in store.  With the recent addition of new desserts and a few supplemental items: Cheese Plate $9.00 Quiche $12.00 Foie Gras Pate $18.00 White Sturgeon Caviar $30.00  I figured it was finally time to check it out. As you step inside, you notice a few cool things: The color scheme of dominantly white(Dining Room, Kitchen, Staff Uniforms) and silver with little splashes of red and other colors and the minimalist approach of the restaurant-glasses, plates, and  excess equipment are cleverly stored away from the public eye.  High end Kitchen utensils, equipment, and gadgets in this white custom designed kitchen would make any pastry chef envious! (I know I was!) Pacojet for all ice creams and sorbets, All Clad pots and pans, German engineered Rosle stainless steel utensils, Flexipans, Silpats , Deco-Relief sugar molds and even that Matfer sugar pump from France($150) that Chef Mio uses to create her blown sugar apples are all high end pastry hardware. Like how Raku's bathrooms are a must see, so is the one here. Just go check it out!  It is also a mini art gallery in here! All of the tiles from Japan, artwork along the walls and in the bathroom, and even Chef Mio's edible sugar art of transforming hot sugar (170C/338F) into spun sugar nests, pulled sugar rings for your edible menu and blown sugar apples for the Ringo Dessert. That is truly an art in itself that requires lots of practice.  The servers here give some of THE BEST service ever, explaining to you what to expect, going over each menu item, offering drink suggestions, clearing and replenishing utensils promptly and discreetly and one of the servers even wrapped my menu so I could take it with me!  Our first "amuse bouche" is the edible rice paper  menu after you have placed your order, served with a raspberry coulis.  We continue with a quenelle(football shape) of  the Mango Sorbet with Mint Jelly and micro mint which awakens our taste buds of what's yet to come  If you're a TUF guy like me, or a TUF gal (lover of all things Truffle, Uni , and Foie Gras) The Foie Gras Pate is a great start before your dessert prix fixe experience. four pieces of foie gras torchon are served with two pyramids of chevre, fresh honeycomb, seasoned puff pastry sticks, and toasted pecans. Rich, decadent, and OH SO GOOD!  We decide on both the Mt. Fuji and the Ringo which are both classics with an updated feel to it. The Mt. Fuji is a take on the classic Chestnut Mont Blanc featuring sponge cake, whipped cream, candied chestnuts, enclosed in velvety smooth chestnut paste. The Ringo is a take on the classic Apple Strudel finished with a delicious honey ice cream. The blown sugar apple acts as an edible vessel for whipped cream and caramel sauce. Both plates were very delicious without being too overly sweet which we both enjoyed. Delicate flavors and textures are  very common in Japanese desserts which are artistic in presentation, and seasonal in taste.  Witnessing Chef Mio and her assistant construct each and every course is like watching a show right before your eyes.(ENJOY IT!!!) They have brought what goes on in a typical restaurant kitchen up close and personal, even making it interactive, answering any questions a diner may have. They both work together like a well oiled machine never skipping a beat, skillfully timing each step, moving in a synchronized manner building each and every dessert component meticulously coordinating as well with the servers and the diner, going more at the diner's speed to ensure each course in a smooth, timely pace.  The Petits Fours plate is our last course which is a mini bittersweet chocolate fondant which comes with rum infused raisins and raspberry and passion fruit marshmallows which are interestingly made using agar-agar powder instead of gelatin with a punch of their natural flavors to end your dessert dining experience. Here are some tips to make the most of your evening at Sweets Raku:  Sit up at the bar to see all of the action-ITS LIKE DESSERT AND A SHOW!!!  If you rather chat with friends, grab the tables behind the bar  Sweets Raku is not for you if your idea of dessert is under $5  Sit back and take in all of the action...Let your senses take you on a journey-sights, sounds, smells, and tastes will make for a memorable evening  This is NOT fast food! Savor each bite and ENJOY!!!     ALOHA!!!
5 I love the creativity of Sweets Raku. First and foremost, this restaurant has no labels, signs, or advertising; just a glass wall, revealing an illuminated white restaurant and silver spoon, that turns a curious eye and allures the adventurous.  If your sweet tooth can handle it, you must do the Prix Fixe.  You'll get a very satisfying three course dessert meal that'll keep you coming back for more.  We came here in search of a new place to satisfy our sweet tooths and boy did we succeed!  With the Prix Fixe, we ordered Apollo, Mt. Fuji, Amuse (Raspberry Sorbet)...and I honestly can't remember the rest because I couldn't concentrate so I stopped taking pictures of the desserts.  Mmmmm mmm delicious!  Even though the Amuse was a small portion, it was more than enough to give me a good fill.  I can't tell you enough how amazing our experience was.  Just about everything is edible, including your menu.  The best place to sit is at the bar, so you can watch them carefully sculpt and craft your dessert.  The service is great and all the servers are very "sweet."  The ambience is modern, calm, and very clean.  I highly recommend Sweets Raku for a date night.  You'll be talking about the desserts all night long.  They're absolutely divine!  Enjoy!
4 I went there during the opening weekend. The place looks so cute! The desserts tasted delicious and well presented. The edible menu was a nice surprise. Pretty expensive, but what a cool concept. You should definitely try it once though. There's a minimum charge per person; if I remember correctly, it's $12 per person, drinks not included.
5 O M G to die for! You must try this place, period. Get the fixed menu, it's worth every penny. Mount Fuji was delicious (roasted chestnut. Warm apple pie with honey ice cream and a cream filled candy apple.
5 I'm not a big fan of desserts but this place blew me away. U definitely have to do the prefixed course menu and the caviar platter. A few bottles of Rose will make any chicken head's panties drop. That's word is bond!!
5 Wow! I wish there was a Sweets Raku in LA.   From the edible menu to the petit four, the whole experience was very unique and tasty.   My suggestion is to get there early as they do run out of items. We were able to try the Marriage but they were out of Mt. Fuji. =( Ringo comes with a candied apple made out of sugar and marshmallow!   There is a $5 split charge.
5 I am a dessert snob. This place takes the cake (literally) on having all around appeal. I love that you can sit at the counter bar and watch everything being prepared. It was my first time here, so I decided to try the pre fix menu, and Sarah Marie did the same, with the intentions of each of us getting something different so we could try both. The standout for me had to be the Apollo (chocolate mousse) and the Mt. Fuji (hazelnut). It was so fun to watch both of these being prepared, and even more fun to eat. I like the different flavor combos too such as parmesan cheesecake.   This is such a unique place, I would love to bring out of town guests here. Who doesn't love coffee, wine, cheese and fancy desserts?
5 Nice place to hang out. Great dessert. Pastry Chef is from Japan and she made great dessert. Very friendly staffs. Open late. Had wine collection.  Very clean.  Would come back again.  $19 for 3 courses dessert. Same plaza as Raku restaurant
5 I took my out-of-town friend here one night since she said she wanted to experience Vegas outside of the strip. What better spot then to take her to a dessert bar where you can supposedly eat the menu?! I've never been to a dessert place where there is actually a set menu with 3 different courses of dessert... faaa-annn-ccyyy!   - Decor & Structure -   Everything is covered completely in white - white tables, white counter top, white work space. Okay, I guess it''s just safe to say I pretty much stepped into heaven.   There's about 2 4-top tables and 1 2-top table that are available to sit at (it may be just 2 total) and the rest of the sitting is at the bar that runs around the working area where you can watch them do their magic. We got there at 8-8:30PM ish on a Friday. I guess we came just in time because as soon as we were leaving there was a line looping around to the door.   This may sound weird, but if you get a chance.. check out the bathroom!! I'm not going to tell you why, just do it.  - Service -  Service was exceptional, as I would expect nothing less. When you first sit down, they give you a hot towel, of course like traditional Japanese custom. They will come back repeatedly to your table always checking to see if your glass is full and is very accommodating to anything you may need.   - Menu -  They offer 3 different kinds of specialty water that is shipped straight from the mountainous waters of Japan. No joke. One that is filled with ions to aid this, minerals to aid that, and one that is just the purest form. It comes in a large bottle that they take straight from the 'refrigerator window display'. It's about $4 a bottle which really isn't that bad when you compare it to the small tiny bottles of Dasani you buy in casinos on the strip, or even Starbucks. We started with all 3 bottles and to me it tasted all the same, except the purest, but hey if you're a water connoisseur you might really enjoy their selection.  Now for the important part, the desserts. To start, as you probably already know, they place a menu in front of you and because I read from other reviews that it's edible, I already began tearing pieces off and putting them in my mouth. Well, it tastes exactly like what you think a menu would taste... like paper. It was coiled and wrapped with a thin candy cane like ring. That was delicious! It's pretty much hardened burnt sugar, so it reminded me a lot of creme brulee. Well the server came back and saw that we had already began chomping away and gave us what we're actually supposed to dip it in had we waited. It was a raspberry syrup that honestly didn't make it taste that much better, but definitely very interesting!  They offer a set menu for $20 or you can order a la carte. Each dessert a la carte is ~$12. The set menu didn't really sound too appealing to me since I figure the first and last course would probably be more of a tasting experience. I was just interested in the main course which is the option you can order a la carte. I wish I could go into detail with each dessert we ordered (total of 3) but they were so fancy and I feel like the menu changes often so you really have to experience it yourself. One thing I can say is that if there's a strawberry shortcake on the menu, you can go ahead and skip that. It's nothing too spectacular. If they still offer it, go for the angel cheescake (?) - as cheesy as it sounds, it tasted like it was made in heaven. Hehe see what I did there?   Anyway, this is something I never really experienced before and would definitely be a place I'd recommend for anyone looking for a date night, or just a sugar addict!
4 I was excited when this place opened and was pleased from the minute I walked in. It's  small, but modern and it's fun to sit at the counter and watch the desserts being plated and sugar being blown. If you are looking for over the top sweet decadent desserts, this is not your place. The desserts here are Japanese style and are delicate, light and not overly sweet. I had the Mt. Fuji which is really the Mont Blanc which you find all over Japan. I think I could've eaten 5 of those.
5 Great experience-Great Desserts with an option of wine....even a cheese plate and foie gras tourchon...the staff at RAKU could learn a thing or two about geniune, friendly service from those who work at Sweets Raku and stop trying to hustle the round eyes with their ME LOVE YOU LONG TIME wait staff...think I am kidding....when you hit the door at RAKU watch the wait staff genuflex in their supercilious manner
5 Best dessert place to go after dinner. My wife and I went two times on our last visit to Vegas in October. What can say, had wonderful time talking to chef and her staff. We will back in January for another visit.
5 This restaurant is an experience.  It is not a, "Hey, want some ice cream or something?" place; it is a, "Let's have a culinary adventure!" kind of place.  When I first saw the menu, I was a little shocked by the price.  It's $19 for a three course prix fixe dessert tasting, plus a $5 split plate charge (since my husband and I wanted to share).  But, after watching everything that goes into the dessert, I see why it's that price.  Let's go back to the beginning: when you walk in, it is a stark white, modern restaurant with this way cool wine rack/display.  I really dug the decor.  You sit down and in front of you is pretty much the coolest silverware you will ever see in your life.  A menu rolled up in a napkin holder thing is set in front of you.  You order, and then.....HOLD UP....the waitress pours some sauce on your plate.  What am I supposed to put in this sauce, you ask??  YOUR MENU.  The menu is freaking edible.  And so is the napkin ring holder thing it came in.  Oh my God, I would pay the money just for the experience of eating the menu.  The first course we had was a pumpkin and green tea pudding.  It was like a creme brûlée and very light and tasty.  For our second course, we ordered the Mt. Fiji cake, which is apparently very popular in Japan.  It was a sponge cake with chesnut cream frosting on top.  Last, we had this mini lava cake with fruit flavored "marshmallow" type things.  The whole menu was excellent, but one of the best parts is that you get to watch the chefs make these beautiful pieces of sugar art right in front of you.  The detail in the desserts is awe inspiring.  Sweets Raku is a place I would take to impress people, and it is definitely a special occasion place to eat.
5 What an experience! As a huge dessert-a-holic, Sweets Raku is heaven with a twist. Hella fancy. I enjoyed sitting at the bar and watching the chefs create their magic in front of us. I'll be back to try the rest of the menu!
4 "My boyfriend ate my menu."  Fortunately, the menus at Sweets Raku are actually edible. That's right, you can EAT your menu. Although it's not that tasty, it still makes for a nice photo op!  Onto other things...  My boyfriend and I shared the prixe fixe menu. We ordered Mt. Fuji for the main dessert. The first course was some sort of green tea custard, which had a nice light flavor. It was a very small portion, but just right. Second course was the main dessert, Mt. Fuji (chestnut cream cake). It was awesome to watch them make this one. The texture was so soft, hence the "cream cake" description. It almost tasted like a tiramisu, but better. It came with a few chips stabbed into it, which was nice for dipping into the outer layer and eating. The third course was a mini lava cake dessert with homemade marshmallows and alcohol infused raisins on the side. It was soo rich and soo good. The perfect ending.   Pros:  -the place is spotless -service is great. They are very attentive and even open the door for you on your way out  -dinner and a show: you get to watch your dessert being made right before your eyes! Of course, most of it is already premade, but you get to see it being put together in a very artistic fashion.  -the bathroom is incredible!! It's something you have to see for yourself -you can share the prixe fixe menu at an extra cost, which I highly suggest (I don't think I could've finished everything on my own) -I don't know what kind of milk they use, but its sweet and delicious!   Cons: -the bathroom door doesn't close all the way unless you give it an extra pull. Someone actually walked in on me. Luckily I was already done with my business! -the waitress took my coat, but forgot to give it to me on my way out. I almost forgot about it completely  All in all, I think this is a great place for dessert, especially if you're trying to go somewhere different with a great ambiance.
5 Items selected:  Sakurambo - Black Tea with Japanese Cherries Edible Menu with Raspberry Sauce Strawberry Sorbet with Mint Gelatin Foie Gras Pate with Croissant Sticks, candied nuts, honey comb, 15 year balsamic, goat cheese mousse, raspberry, mango Ringo - Apple ladder with Honey Ice Cream and candy apple filled with apple mousse Molten Chocolate Cake - Passion fruit and Raspberry Marshmallows, Raisins  A firm believer in Ernestine Ulmer's quote that "Life is uncertain, Eat dessert first" and more than aware that Vegas darling Aburiya Raku had recently opened the 3pm-12am desserts only location in the shopping center Mecca on West Spring Mountain it was with a bit of surprise that I arrived at Sweets Raku at 5pm to find myself the only restaurant's only patron - a feeling that lingered as I sat down at the small counter and one that bloomed into amazement as the evening progressed.  Small and intimate despite the brilliant white backdrop and with excellent service that is formal yet friendly the basic format of Sweets Raku is that of a three course dessert tasting with a few supplemental savories and after ordering the Sakurambo suggested by my server the evening proceeded with the clever candy menu paired with rich raspberry sauce before proceeding to palate cleanser of light strawberry sorbet amidst refreshing mint gelatin and then a supplementary course of creamy duck liver brilliantly paired with items sweet, savory, and acidic plus buttery laminated pastry made to order in the open kitchen.   Progressing next to the main course, one of five selections on a frequently changing menu, I can only say that if a picture is worth a thousand words then the combination of presentation and flavor displayed by "Ringo" was exponentially greater, the candy apples hand-blown before me and piped with apple mousse resting besides a perfect apple ladder and creamy honey ice cream made in house.  A beautiful night already in motion long before heading to dinner with friends it will not be long before I return to Sweets Raku and next time it will likely be without plans for afterward so that I can further explore the menu, or at least linger with coffee to accompany the sizable molten chocolate 'mignardise.'
5 In Las Vegas you're always dining on a strip. If you're not dining on The Strip, you'll most likely be dining in nondescript strip malls in neighborhoods that you don't want to be caught walking at night. Still they are worth the drive/cab fare because the local foodie scene can be just as a fun experience as any Strip eating experience, as well as being a bit more reasonably priced. You just have to know exactly what you're looking for.  I wanted to take the No1DP out for a meal to celebrate his belated birthday and my appreciation for him being such a wonderful boyfriend by letting me tag along with him this trip.   --- CAB FARE: ~$14 to the Palazzo base fare.  VENUE: Located in a strip mall off Spring Mountain, the restaurant is very small with about half the guests being in tables and the other half sitting at the bar. If you are a foodie, SIT AT THE BAR. You'll see two dedicated and passionate pastry chefs make your desserts with such care and attention to your dish. Walls are almost bare so as not to distract you from the desserts - part of the experience is to watch them make your dessert.  As it's a small space, call ahead for approximate wait times. They do not take reservations.  SERVICE: No1DP may be used to Japanese waitstaff but I thought the waitress serving us was very cheerful and polite. Her accent was so thick that I couldn't get the descriptions of the desserts so I had to ask the pastry chefs to explain again as I scrawled it on a napkin.   PRIX FIXE ($19, $7 with wine) No1DP noticed that the menu was made with a type of paper that you could actually eat and tore off a piece. This was confirmed by the waitress; after placing our orders she brought a plate with a raspberry sauce for us to dip our menus. The menu tastes like edible paper that is best dipped with the raspberries. The ring that holds the menu is also edible, we saw more rings being made in the counter.  The 3-couse prix fixe consists of the following Amuse Both of us started with kabocha pudding (green tea sauce, chocolate and kabocha chip). Texture is similar to black sesame pudding I've had at another Japanese restaurant. There is a mild but evident sweetness in the dish that is offset by the pumpkin. This was also the only dish we didn't see made.  Mains No1DP had Apollo (chocolate and raspberry mouse mousse, chocolate cake, earl grey ice cream). Japanese desserts are not known for their richness though you could still taste the chocolate and raspberry. No1DP liked his dish and wine pairing enough that he was willing to risk getting a migraine to enjoy his dessert wine. As a fan of earl grey tea, he also enjoyed his ice cream.  I had Mt. Fuji (chestnut cake, chestnut paste, custard creme, Hennessy syrup). I got to see my dessert being made from start to finish. Apparently they use some contraption to make the chesnut cream take shape, followed by refrigerating the dish to let the cream hold. Chesnuts were slightly crunchy and chesnut cream and cake were light and fluffy. My wine was a slightly tart white wine to add but not overload the chestnuts.  Petit Four As the No1DP's dish contained chocolate, his petit four was a small piece of cheesecake that contained REAL cheese on the top. No1DP notes that the portion was light, delicate and small enough for him, otherwise he would have had a dessert overload.  My petit four was the traditional small lava cake with raisins and raspberry and passion fruit decorated on the side. I saw how committed to perfection the chefs are as they erased any imperfections with a napkin and redid the decoration. Raisins and marshmallows were light. Lava cake was small enough as a finishing dish yet contained all the components of a good lava cake - fluffy yet firm cake with hot molten chocolate in the center.  As we left the waiters noticed that we were from out of town and thanked us wholeheartedly for stopping by. Considering that I rarely go off-strip to eat anything seeing warm genuine service with a smile was much appreciated.   Final word: Go here if you want a new meaning/experience to eating desserts, which in most instances are often rush and shoe-horned at the end of meals. Don't go here if you just want to grab a quick sweet or if you like your desserts rich.
5 Science lab meets fine dining! You start off with reading and selecting what you want and drink. Then EAT the menu. The whole place is set up as if you are about to embark a culinary experiment. I rarely use the word "innovative" when describing a dining experience - Sweets Raku deserves that description. The desserts are delicious to both eyes and tongue. The layers and attention to detail is wonderfully executed. Right down to the utensils. The whole experience of Sweets Raku embodies everything Japanese but does not overwhelm the visitor. And just as a quirk, the bathroom has a bidet. The proprietors of Sweets Raku are bold and inviting. I can't wait to visit and experience it all over again.
2 Came here with my ladies (and gentlemen) and I think 5 of us opted for the pre fixe menu while Kristina ordered a la carte. I asked for the apple pie to go with the sorbet and molten lava cake. While everything was good, I find the items to be rather typical dessert items that one can get in a bakery anywhere. The three-spoonful sorbet was good but really, it's just sorbet. Nice and unique take on the apple pie, that I have to give it to Sweets Raku. Finally, the molten chocolate cupcake, really? I can make that at home using my microwave in less than 5 minutes. How disappointing.   Just a note on the utensils: I know the knife and fork look very eclectic but they definitely were not easy to use. I could barely cut my apple pie with the knife and the fork was so awkward to handle I think it gave me finger cramps.   As for the service, the waitress serving us had such a strong accent I could barely make out what she said. She was really sweet and nice but if I couldn't understand what the heck she was saying.    At $27 including tips, this was a "meh" experience.   One time was enough. I'm not planning on coming back.
2 Sweet Raku should be Secret Raku-oh the difficulty finding this place! We were running around like it was a black ops mission. One person went to one corner the other was looking around the block, another was in the middle of the parking lot trying to get a GPS signal for location. We finally found the place which is next to Big Wong. *Phew wiping sweat off forehead*  1 point...The presentation of the food was fancy but the taste was not a wow factor. I had the apple pie with no ice cream, so they substituted white chocolate square instead.   1 point...Friendly staff and very accommodating. Our group of 6 wanted to sit at the counter and they made it happen.  First and last time coming here. It's to expensive and the service is slow and I'm lactose intolerant. Most of the dishes have heavy cream.
4 totally worth the hype.  this haven away from the strip provides delectable treats in a modern, artistic setting. you'd be hard-pressed to even remember you are just doors down from Ozzie's Poker Bar.  slick white tables and walls hidden behind stacks of some of the best top-of-the-line champagne. the storefront is logo-less so just look hard to find it right next to the italian japanese restaurant.  $19 dessert prix fixe - worth it. don't be like me and bypass it because you think "it's just dessert". at Sweets Raku - it's not JUST dessert.  $12 individual entrees if this tickles your fancy. not the traditional sickly sweet desserts either. everything is well rounded in flavor and acidity and so shockingly beautiful, you won't even want to eat it. don't worry though, you'll get over that sensation quickly.  the Marriage is the fluffiest of sponge cakes with a banana custard, whipped cream, and strawberry sorbet (?? - didn't taste like sorbet, but sure looks like it). look for the banana.. it's there, and it makes tons better.  the Mt. Fuji is a masterful concoction of chestnut. chestnut. chestnut. and more chestnut on top. but so subtle and light, it doesn't even feel like you're digging into a beautiful mountain of cream.  yes, the menu is edible. don't be like me and eat it alone though. wait for your raspberry sauce. so yumm. I ate it all. no shame.  Sweets Raku was the main reason why I got the Vegas itch again, and it was beyond worth it. so happy I made the trek out to this dessert oasis & I absolutely cannot wait to return.
5 this place is the bomb!! I love desserts, especially the kind that just have that right hint of sweetness! Not sickeningly sweet, but just perfect.   So you can guess that I LOVED this place because this is exactly what it was!!   it is the dessert extension of Raku, so we had very high expectations!!  If you can't find this place...I'll give you a hint...look for the red nearby in the same area as Raku.   AMBIANCE: 5 - the place is neat and tidy. Everything is clean and completely white! anything placed on the white surface becomes the focus, and it's a striking, powerful, and beautiful dish every single time.  the utensils are retro. everything that I saw was modern and really chic.   There is limited seating: a bar area and three tables. being seated at the bar is better, you can see them prepare dishes!!  SERVICE: 5 - They were extremely polite and answered every question that we had. They also explained every single thing that was on the plate in detail. they were extremely responsive and catered to everything that was asked.  btw, they can talk quiet and be hard to understand!  FOOD: 5 - This must come in parts.  1. there is a long, nice list of expensive alcoholic wines and beverages. 2. the menu is edible. try to eat it and they will offer a raspberry sauce, which made it better. It was a nice, tasty starter..but not really my thing! 3. their dessert menu changes every month. 4. they offer a full 3-courses of desserts called a Prix Fixe. ($19) Separately desserts are $12 and there was also side dishes!   I chose Prix Fixe. It was delicious. it wasn't too sweet. First came Mango sorbet with mint jelly. A nice, light starter. Main Course, I chose Mt. Fuji, a light chestnut cake. It was just heavenly. Last, a molten lava cake with marshmallow and another raspberry mousse on the side. Angel Creme is also very good!!   it was like a light sweet dessert-dinner, and I loved it. Everything was amazing!!  you have to remember that you're paying for the Raku name and the presentation and the desserts. I thought it was beautiful and worth the money. A truly unique experience!
5 Dessert Art at its best!...Think Mondrian not Pollock here though.  Yet another dessert review from the guy that loves savory items...I first came here when my sister had a molten lava cake urge that needed to be satisfied and I refused to go to Chili's.  We were fortunate enough to run into Cathy C. (maybe you recognize her form her S.R. ROTD fame--the duchess herself).  Cathy offered some suggestions and we were on our way to a blissful experience.  Sweets Raku is as much about the experience as it is the dessert.  The food is presented masterfully with an eye for composition.  Most of the seating is at the bar--allowing not only for a pure, open feel, but also for a wonderful look into the art of plate presentation...a Vegas show worth checking out!   The ambiance is angelic.  I was waiting to hear Morgan Freeman or James Earl Jones' voice welcome me through the back door of heaven...instead the door at the back leads to one of the cooler bathrooms in Vegas...and yes, this is still part of the experience, so be sure to check out the bathroom while you're here.  The desserts are well above average, but play on the clean/delicate side as opposed to the ooey gooey/decadent side of tasty treats.  While quite nice, the short of it is that I would not give out 5 stars on the desserts alone.  When paired with the preceding paragraph, I am all-in!  Sweets Raku also has one of the better selections of dessert wines...dessert wines are not my cup of tea...err...glass of vino, but I did enjoy the dessert wine pairings...they're worth a shot to those moderately open to the idea.  They also have a few nice Reds and Whites...so you're safe if you despise dessert wines...in fact they offer a couple pinot noirs that are mellow enough to pair with many of the the deserts.   Speaking of pinoits, they offer a few savory items including a cheese plate that is asking to be paired with a glass of pinot or balanced red wine.  Stay away if you are afraid for paying a little more $$$ for a little less in dessert quantity, but put Sweets Raku at the top of dessert list if you are looking for great experience and a break from the norm.
5 WHO: For the love of Magnificent, Decadent, Magical (I can go on and on) Desserts!!  WHERE: On Spring Mountain and Decatur, in the same plaza as Raku and Monta Ramen.  WHEN: They are open on Monday through Saturday from 3pm-midnight.  WHAT: What to do when your friend and yourself are craving something sweet at 10pm? YOU TAKE THAT CRAVING IN YOUR CAR, AND HEAD TO SWEETS RAKU!  My friend and I GPS'ed Sweets Raku with excitement on a cold night. As we parked, we were looking for restaurant sign, but couldn't seem to find it. We ended up walking to their sister restaurant, Raku, and the lovely lady came outside of the restaurant to point to where we should have been. Fyi, if you are first timers, look for the red carpet and or huge spoon right beside the DOOR TO HEAVEN!  When we walked down the red carpet, and through the doors, it definitely felt like HEAVEN ON EARTH. We were greeted and sat at a table, our server came up to us asking if the seats we had were okay because they actually recommend you sitting up at the bar as first-timers. So we ended up moving over to the bar so that we could observe the dessert chefs making our desserts.  The menus were brought to us... COOLEST THING EVER... The menus are edible! (For all of you Asians who remember the White Rabbit candies where they had a second edible wrapper, it is similar to that!) The server saw me chewing on my menu, and offered raspberry syrup do dip it in. ;) EVEN BETTER!  Prior to devouring the menu, I made the choice in ordering the Prix Fixed desserts, where there are 3 desserts for $19.  The first is a Mango Sorbet with Green Tea jelly, the second you may choose from the desserts in the A la cart- there are normally about 4-5 desserts you are able to choose from, and then lastly, the Petits Fours, which is a Molten Chocolate cake with marshmallows and raisins drenched in goodness.  For the dessert of my choice, I had their Angel Cream. It was absolutely amazing, and shaped into a Yummy angel. NOTE: I LOVE HOW ALL OF THEIR DESSERTS ARE NOT CRAZILY SWEET. They are all filled with LOVE, and not too much sugar! (Diet friendly). My friend also chose the Prix fixed dessert, and chose the Chestnut cake. It was also a light dessert, amazingly PERFECT!  OTHER THINGS I LOVE: The ambiance is just so soothing. The decor is a very modern chic, with white on white furniture! Simple, yet Beautiful! I love the utensils and their setup! I love the wonderful and cheerful chefs and servers. I just love this place and will be back every single month! I want to go back just writing about it! Sigh... Lol.  To conclude: No matter what mood you are in, dessert is always the way to go, but always remember... STRESSED is DESSERTS spelled backwards ;)
2 After dinner desserts with friends on a Saturday night. We wanted to try this place because of all the great reviews that people have been posting. It was a bit confusing finding the place, since there is another restaurant in the same lot with the name, "Raku". There was a line to get in when we arrived, so we ended up waiting about 15 minutes or so. Ask to be seated at the counter, so you watch them prepare the food.  Edible menus - ok, cute. After looking over the menu, decided on "pre fixe", since one of my dining mates recommended it.  Pros:  - Great presentation of the desserts; so 'artsy'! - Clean, almost sterile appearance - Clean restroom with a toilet that has a proximity sensor (opens automatically) - Friendly, smiling staff  Cons:  - the price: $40+ , (gratuity is automatically tacked on), for dessert for 2 people (no drinks) - WHAT??? Ok, I see gold flake in some of the desserts that were served to us. Does that make it worth it? Well, It looked nice, but I was still hungry when I left. I don't remember anything particularly special about it. Plus my wallet was a little lighter. - Ok, restroom was clean, but it took me a few seconds to figure out which object was the sink. It looked like a barrel of some sort. - I could barely understand what the server was saying (see below). Perhaps they should use pictures? - It kind of feels like you're in Japan... in a bad way, which means, it is small and cramped, and feels over-crowded. - Get a sign, for Christ's sake! I know the giant spoon in the front is a visual cue, but how many people know to look for that, and how visible is that from the street? It's like going to a rave in an undisclosed location. You won't know that you're there unless you ask one of the other people waiting in line to get in. - If you are lactose intolerant, cross this place off your list. It seems like everything made here is made from milk.  Summary (IMHO):  Bang for the buck?? Nope. Not here. Not to me at least. Hey, that's great that they can get away with charging almost $20, for something that I can probably figure out how to make at home for less than $10 and still have second or third servings. I don't think i'll be coming back here - unless somebody else insists on footing the bill.
5 Still ranking a dessert tasting at Joel Robuchon amongst her favorite meals of all time a visit to Sweets Raku was a foregone conclusion during my mother's visit to Las Vegas and again taking the dessert before dinner approach but this time electing a table as opposed to the counter results would prove no less stellar, a three course tasting of almost entirely new selections as Christmas music played overhead to compliment the fir at the entry and festive, edible menu.  All clean lines, brilliant whites, and lovely service with Jasmine tea for mother and an Illy Americano for myself the meal again began with sorbet and mint gelee, this time mango, and with palates prepped the plates that followed were again equal parts beauty and flavor, both the Mt. Fuji and Angel Cream presented ornately and impossibly light with variant textures throughout, the roasted chestnuts the highlight of the former while a buttery biscuit juxtaposing soft pears anchored the white chocolate winged cream.  Clearly a space never lacking for creativity it really should have come as no surprise that 'mignardises' would prove equally impressive as the rest of the evening but with a duo of options again presented with great attention to detail I will simply say that while the chocolate fondant cake sampled on my first visit was again excellent I would strongly suggest making a request for the parmesan cheesecake, a savory riff on the classic rivaling the works of Shawn Gawle's Tarte at Saison and Gabriel Kreuther's Cheese Souffle at The Modern for my favorite things done with cheese in 2013.
4 For my last review of 2013 what better than to review a desserts only restaurant?    I arrived at Sweets Raku at about 7 last night and I was the only customer for about 10 minutes.  I chose the prix fixe 3 course dessert menu along with a pot of peach tea.  I sat at the bar because I wanted to see the pastry chefs doing their thing up close.  For the three course prix fixe, you only have 1 choice--the second dessert.  The first, the amuse, and the last, the petit four, are fixed depending on the day and season.  For the first course last night, the amuse was an oval of mango sorbet with blue ice as Yuka, my server, described it to me.  It was mint jelly on the mango sorbet and it made a good pairing of flavors.  Course two I chose.  I had read the Yelp reviews and I was sure I'd go with the Mt. Fuji.  Yuka told me the Ringo (apple pie) was made that day and was excellent.  I finally decided on the Baton which was a tall thin chocolate mini-tower with chocolate and pistachio mousse and some fresh mango cubes.  It was excellent.  It was a little tricky to eat because I tried to peel a piece of the very thin chocolate tower to dip in the mousse but the tower is so fragile, it sometimes breaks away.  Regardless, it was tasty and lots of fun.  Course three, the petit four, was a delicious parmesan cheesecake with tangerine pieces.  The cheesecake was excellent.  None of the desserts was sweet which was very appealing.  It's not that I don't like sweet--it's just that it isn't needed in every dessert.    Service was excellent!  Yuka was a gem. We did have a bit of a language problem but then I don't speak Japanese and she speaks English.  Do yourself and sit at the bar and watch the ladies work magic with preparing these delightful pastries!    For those of you still trying to find the place when you arrive at the plaza, it's just south of Big Wong Restaurant.  Look for the wine rack through the glass windows.  At night, you won't see the spoon hanging outside.
5 Japanese desserts and pastries are very special in Japan. During holidays, special events and occasions small intricate desserts are presented as gifts. I haven't seen or felt anything in the US that reminds me of that feeling- until Sweets Raku!!!  The service and ambiance is so warm and inviting. The white counters, tables and china are expertly designed to compliment the colors and flavors of the desserts. Even the menus and items on it are carefully thought out to have that wow factor. I think the $19 Prix Fix is perfect! A cheap cup of factory made gelato is $10 on the strip and Sweet Raku desserts are made delicately by hand to order!  My first visit order consisted of:  *Strawberry sorbet with mint jelly- lightly sweet with a great texture contrast with the jelly. *Ringo (Apple in Japanese)- a strudel like apple dessert with lattice top. Served next to a ruby red sugared apple filled with caramel and cream and perfectly sweetened honey ice cream! Superb! *Chocolate lava cake with rum raisins and berry/passion fruit marshmallows!  I ordered the cherry tea which came in the most perfect tea cup with cute tea pot. This helped compliment and add contrast to the meal although water would probably do just as well. I love their tea cups!  This was an amazing experience! I was here for about an hour. Perfect wow moment to bring friends or a date. I also like eating at the counter so I can watch the process and the small detail the chefs add to make each plate edible art.   It is a small space and does get busy here and sometimes there is a wait. I love that this is a hidden gem and has no signage. Makes it feel more special and intimate.
5 FINALLY I got to try Sweets Raku. I loved loved loved Raku so I had no doubt in my mind that I would love Sweets Raku too. We had to wait about 15 minutes on a Saturday night for our group of 6 which was split up, but later on we were all together again after a couple had left. My husband and I both got the prix fixe menu and it didn't disappoint! We got to sit at the bar and see all the action which was pretty neat. I decided on the Mt. Fuji, because I saw the "noodles" and I knew that is what I wanted. Turns out it was not noodles but awesome deliciousness. My husband ordered the Apollo and I just remember it being very chocolately. I did order a peach tea....but I should know that I am not a big fan of black tea. I loved the smell, but I needed honey or something which isn't the correct way to drink the tea anyways.   Service was awesome. I could probably sit there all day and watch these ladies work their magic. It was a bit hot in there, but with the steamer and oven constantly working that is expected. My friend in our group just ordered the apple pie. I think that is what I will order next time I come back! I loved everything and the details of it is exactly what Raku is all about.   P.S. Parking sucks here. =)
4 Willie Wonka, eat your heart out...no really...just grind em!  Especially after a wholesome night at Tratorria Nakamura Ya.  If you can't find the place since the signage is discreet, look for the spoon on the wall.  Afterwards, upon entry, if you run into a wall made of wine bottles, you have just entered the back door to heaven.  I ain't even got a sweet tooth, however, any place that offers a edible menu on wafer paper, served with berry dipping sauce...count me in!  It's like being given a top secret mission before destroying the encrypted message via consumption, I love it!  The plan was easy, devour all the extravagant sweets in sight, take photos off everything, laugh with strangers and comment about how we would all slap the spit out of our mama's since everything was soo Damn delicious, all the while acting bujee as a mofo.  Mission accomplished, and some.  We stayed with the amuse that included Mint jelly on fresh strawberry sorbet followed by conquering Mt. Fuji.  The dormant volcano erupted with a concoction consisting of water chestnuts topped with a stringy looking covering that resembled soba noodles, very interesting.  The Ringo just might be the best apple pie I ever had.  The fish came with cream encased in a sugar casing shaped like a candied apple, the design was immaculate.  I washed everything down with a Cappuccino and glad I did.  A friend got the iced coffee that used ice cubes ice cubes made of coffee! It was placed on a Lego coaster just as the movie is coming out soon, nice.  You gotta end the night on the cheesecake adorned with tangerine chunks.  The decor was magnificent and you could enjoy it with orchestra music.  The best part of all was the bathroom, I ish you not!  I had to check it out after our friends went I there and came out exhilarated.  Once I got in there I didn't see anything that initially stood out, until...The toilet seat cover automatically opened on me at such an elegant speed.  But this was no regular toilet, it was a black futuristic bidet!  Not only was it finished in a bold onyx black, it came with a massage feature, say what!?!  As if having dessert bliss wasn't enough...you get to shoot water up where the sun don't shine...  Afterwards, the faucet came out of the wall and poured water into what looked like a bucket filled with faux greenery and vines.  I had to video IG my memorable experience here at Sweets Raku.  Worth a bite!
5 Sweets Raku is a destination dessert place. Want a quick dessert or not a fan of dessert, this isn't the place for you. But to those that love creative and fun sweet treats this place is a delight.  It's a small space so you may have to wait especially if you are larger group. We walk right in and were seated at a 9:30 on a Thursday, there were folks waiting most of the time we were there. It's all white space including the kitchen and bar. Seat at the bar if you can and watch them make the desserts.  There are only 5 dessert choices and the best way to have them is in the prix fixe. Each one has a theme and they are marvelous. The angle cake is a round mound with a edible halo and wings. The designs are simple but playful.  the prix fixe consisted of- the edible menu dipped in raspberry sauce, an amuse of sorbet & gelee, a choice of dessert and a tiny chocolate molton cake with tiny marshmellows and rum raisins. The apple pie was shaped like an apple, another dessert looked like a meatball covered in spaghetti.   We also got the caviar service which was good but not top notch. They use farmed caviar and didn't mention it until we were served. It has a weaker flavour than real caviar. But it was delight to layer the egg, onion and caviar on the tiny bread puffs.  They make excellent cappuccinos. They also have wine pairing for the desserts.  The space is wheelchair accessible, very good lighting. The servers was very sweet if rather soft spoken.  Truly a magical place worth the trip off the strip.
5 OH. MY. GOD.  This is the happiest place on earth. Forget that Disneyland nonsense (even though I do love it there).  This place is now joke. It's so clean, well-lit, happy, friendly and fun.  From the moment you walk in, you are greeted with a smile and a prix-fixe menu. The menu is edible, so once you make your selections, go ahead and eat it. Maybe instagram it too.  I highly suggest you sit at the dessert bar. This way you can watch the dessert magicians hand craft your desserts.  It's a three-course menu. I believe they change week by week.   I won't go into more details because there are plenty of photos on Yelp that will do it justice.
2 I know EVERYONE and their Momma's are raving about what a WONDERFUL place this is.  If you want a great waste of hard earned money, sure! Honestly, any dessert place on the strip will knock this place out of the map when it came to taste.  The funniest thing is that almost every review of this place only talks about how the desserts look and how they are prepared, barely any of the review tells you how the food actually TASTES.  And if you're going to put ANY sort of food in your mouth, TASTE is pretty damn important. (DUH!)  The GOOD: The ambiance and the posh-ness of the whole place (very IKEA-ish). I think the BATHROOM takes the cake for me (pun intended).  It was the most exciting part of the whole thing. AND the preparation/presentation of the food was pretty cool.    THE BAD: All smokes and mirrors in this place.  When it came to taste, it wasn't even up to par with basic desserts you can make yourself.  HONESTLY, the only thing this place has going for it, is that THEY MAKE THE FOOD LOOK GOOD. So, if you want to impress your friends on Instragram or Pintrest or your social medias, by all means, $25 + tip is not too much, I guess.  But if you want to satisfy your cravings for sweets and dessert, THIS PLACE IS NOT IT.    ETC: The flavor, texture and the complex of their menu items is very bland and I felt like I was eating a bunch of flavored fondant, except they left out the sweetness and delectable aspects of a dessert. There's no comfort in it.  No warmth in the dessert.  It was just plain and simple, OKAY.
5 This hidden little gem has no signage,but I believe is the second store in from the street and next to a sushi restaurant. You can see a huge wine display in front with a very white clean interior. I took two friends here on a friend's suggestion where "you can even eat the menu." That alone sold me. What intrigue! And the idea of a prix fixe (~$19) dessert menu for a dessert lover like me is a match made in heaven. I highly suggest going with a couple people so you  can try their desserts, too. ;]   Menu- a scroll of rice paper with a pulled sugar ring, with a raspberry sauce dip.   First course was a strawberry sorbet with mint gelee.  Second course you get to pick 1 of 5 choices. Though the waitress described all the desserts quickly and thoroughly, I could only catch a few words here and there. But she had such enthusiasm, that I didn't want to make her repeat herself.  -angel cream: light, airy, not too sweet, lots of cream, mango pieces buried beneath, wings of white chocolate, and a halo of pulled sugar.  -apple pie: a little too sweet for me, fun to eat, lots of components...  -mt fuji: looked like spaghetti with mocha flavored crisps, had a mature taste, would go great with hot tea.  Third course was a petite four: chocolate molten lava cake with dried fruit and fruit flavored soft squares. I don't know how else to describe them.. but it was good and I finished the whole thing..   I loved sitting at the counter and seeing them make everything right before my eyes. It was cool seeing them prepare for the next day as well. The service was great, almost ninja like as I never noticed when they refilled my water. The bathroom was pretty neat, too. Check this place out! You won't be disappointed.
4 So I took 2 friends here and after we ordered I started to piece off some of the menu to eat when my friends started laughing asking what the hell i was doing.  I told them the menu was edible and they looked at me like i was crazy.  The texture didn't really seem like it was edible and a couple seated next to us started laughing.  I thought....damm those Yelpers steered me wrong or maybe i read it wrong but a few minutes the raspberry sauce came out and the couple next to us laughed and said.........now....... u can eat your menu.   I wanted to jump up in victory teasing my friends that i was right.  Yelp would never steer me wrong!  The desserts here were excellent.  All the desserts are delicate and not overly sweet typical of Jap desserts.  For $20 it s a great value with the preparation and overall experience.   Honestly i would prefer 3-4 desserts from suzuya but u cant go wrong here.  Definite must try for tourists or looking for a fun date spot.
5 Sweets Raku is as serious about desserts as the cookie monster is about cookies. The desserts are absolutely exquisitely crafted. The prix fixe menu offers three courses starting with an amuse, a choice of the day's desserts, and a petit four. Wine pairings are offered for an additional $7. Prior to ordering, we were presented with an edible rice paper menu. It was a fun way of showcasing some of the thought and skill that goes into all the desserts here. It was served with a delicious raspberry sauce.   The amuse was a strawberry sorbet with mint gelée. It was a simple, yet refreshing starter. For my next course, I got the ringo ("apple" in Japanese), which was apple pie served with an edible caramelized apple with a side of honey sorbet. The most aesthetically-pleasing and impressive component was the apple. The flavors were reminiscent of a creme brulée with a nice candied shell protecting the cream inside. The flavorful honey sorbet was made without any sugar.   Other main courses included the angel cream, which was light  and enjoyable. The Mt. Fuji, the most interesting of the bunch, was a chestnut cream cake that depicts the most well-known peak in Japan. It looked more like a ball of spaghetti, but the chestnut flavors dominated the dish. Our tasting ended with a mini chocolate molten lava cake with dried fruit and marshmallows.   The unique counter seating gave a great view of all our desserts being prepared. One last note. Whether you need to use the restroom or not, check it out. The sink and faucet are one-of-a-kind. Sweets Raku is definitely worth a visit the next time you're in Vegas.
5 PRIX FIXE for the experience! Great service! Nice, attentive staff! And delicious desserts! MUST GO!
4 Sweets Raku is a dessert bar in the same shopping center as it's sibling, Raku. I didn't see a sign for the shop so it's a bit hard to find. Sweets only serves desserts and the occasional cheese fare along with a nice selection of teas and alcoholic beverages. I don't believe they take reservations and it's a small space (around 20 seats) so a long wait time can be expected. To get a better experience, try to get a seat at the bar so you can watch your desserts being made. Each dessert is a lovely piece of art. From my experience, the flavors were not out-of-this-world good, but good nonetheless.  Overall, Sweets Raku is a unique dining experience that won't break the bank (unless you order and drink a lot of alcohol). How unique? Even their menu is edible.
3 I was torn on how many stars I should be giving to Sweets Raku. In the end, I decided on a 3 star rating.  A total of 4 of us decided to go to Sweets Raku for dessert. I've been dying to try this place and because there were a lot of us that went, we got to try a good portion of their menu! Sweets Raku does a prix fixe menu for $19 and it has a total of 3 courses. The first course and the third course is the same for everyone (kind of) while the second course, you get to choose one from a list of five choices. So let's get started!  Menu: Yes, yes, the menu is edible. When they first bring you the menu, it's rolled up and secured with a ring. The paper is edible and so is the ring. Was it good? The ring was. The menu, itself, was like a sheet of styrofoam almost. There was no taste to it and the texture was not pleasant for me. Of course, later on, they give you some raspberry syrup to dip it in and even then, I still did not like it. The ring, on the other hand, was fine. It's just sugar after all.   First course. Amuse. It was a mango sorbet with mint jelly and decorated with a piece of mint. I liked the mango sorbet because it had a strong taste of mango. It tasted like real mango ... with a tinge of tangyness to it. It was refreshing to the senses.   For the second course, we ordered 4 different types of dessert and was able to share it all.  Baton. Chocolate and pistachio mousse. HOW DO YOU EAT THIS THING? It was a chocolate cake bottom with pistachio mousse wrapped with chocolate wafer and decorated with candy on top. Yeah, can't say that I tasted pistachio in that. I actually didn't remember what it was made out of except for chocolate so pistachio never crossed my mind that night. I think my favorite part of this dessert was the chocolate wafer surrounding it.   Marriage. Strawberry and banana. This dessert, to me, was one of the better ones. It was light and fruity. Can I taste the strawberry? Yes but that's probably because I ate the strawberries. Can I taste the banana? No. I still liked it because it was light and fruity. It wasn't dense or heavy. But it's not great enough to write anything home about.   Mt. Fuji. Chestnut cream cake. This was, by far, one of the favorites among everyone. I love chestnut and I love a chestnut dessert done right. However, this may have been a favorite but I feel that there may have been somethings that could've been executed better in this dessert. Compared to the other desserts we had that night, Mt. Fuji ran a flat line for me and it held no range. There was nothing particularly different about it. I could buy a chestnut dessert at Suzuya and it could be potentially better except smaller in size. It would've been better if they had a harder crust like bottom, like they do in fruit tarts. Speaking of the bottom, the bottom of this dessert was odd. Half of the bottom was cake and the other half was something else -- I forgot. I would be eating one side, talking bout how good the chestnut bits were and my friend, who was on the other side, would look at me like, "Where are you finding this?" In the end...good, but can be better.   Ringo. Apple pie. This dish is very interesting because they have a piece of apple pie on one side. Then next to it is an apple shaped candy with cream filling. Then next to the apple is a honey ice cream. If the apple pie was replaced by something else, this particular dessert would've won it all for me. However, I'm not an apple pie person and I understand that apple pie fits the theme to this dish. The candy apple and honey ice cream was great. The sweetness of the candy mixes well with the cream inside of it. The honey ice cream was not too sweet. It had a hint of sweetness but it goes so well with anything and everything.   Now the third course is a petite four. It's typically a lava cake but if you had ordered the Baton, you get a cheesecake instead. The lava cake is decorated by fruity marshmallows and alcoholic raisins. Funny thing .. my friend tried the raisin and said it was good so I popped one in my mouth. Hilarity ensues. My face scrunches up and I automatically look for a napkin to spit in. No, just no and WHY? The lava cake is ... a lava cake. You know, when it comes to Japanese made desserts, I expect it to be light and fluffy. Nope, not the case. The lava cake was dense and so very rich in chocolate. No go for me.   Now the cheesecake version..it was decorated by pieces of grapefruit, which I'm VERY thankful for. I like grapefruit and I know they did not soak it in alcohol first. The cheesecake? Dense and heavy. It was like eating a block of cheese -- no joke.  Was it a good experience? Indeed it was. This is the first time I've done a prix fixe menu for DESSERTS. Did I have a good time? Absolutely. My friends were there with me every step of the way. Would I go to Sweets Raku again? Most likely not. I absolutely cannot justify the price tag of $19 for 3 desserts that I didn't fall in love with. I don't even miss it.
5 Excellent service. Excellent dessert. Excellent atmosphere. Everyone was so polite. The cream puff is my favorite. It melts in your mouth. All the desserts are not too sweet. Very tasty and light. The pound cake chestnut is also very good. I'll bring my family here for sure.
4 "We don't fit in" says my poker bud.  "What are you talking about" I say.  "Look around, everyone in here is Asian" he whispers.  "And what are we?" I answer dumbfounded.  "No, I mean they are like Wong Fu Asian.  You know, guys in skinny jeans carrying around stuffed animals for girls who weigh 90 pounds or less and take pics with whisker fingers" he continues.  Laughing uncontrollably "Shut up and eat your menu".  Sweet Raku is about hand crafted, refined, JAPANESE desserts; delicate flavors and natural, subtle sweetness.  This is not the diabetic sugary desserts most Americans are familiar with.  A fresh fruit would have the same amount of sweetness as their offerings.  Tip: Opt for the three course tasting.  Widest selection and best value.  Standout examples:  Mt. Fuji - A neutral chestnut sponge cake topped with lightly candied chestnuts robbed in ribbons of airy chestnut cream.  An ode to the chestnut.  Ringo - Modern take on the apple pie.  Barely sweetened apples sandwiched between flaky, slightly salty crust atop white chocolate.  A blown sugar apple filled with cream and an aromatic, slightly bitter sweet honey ice cream, all dusted with powder sugar finish the plate.    Good selection of coffee and tea drinks.  Well chosen wine list.  Great off Strip prices.  And yes, the menu was delicious.
4 This place is a hidden gem in Vegas. Its a trendy atmosphere with exceptional service. The desserts are yummy (however not all had a wow taste) and you get to watch them make it in front of you. There is wine, beer, and tea to choose from for drinks.
5 I can't believe this place open till midnight!!!  I thought I was already full, but still I could finish full course desset!!! Fantastic experience :)
5 Sweets Raku is becoming a hot ticket in town! With a 2013 Pastry Chef of the Year award by Desert Companion, and a tie for best desserts(with Art of Flavors) by Mr. Eating Las Vegas, Chef Mio is ON FIYAH!!!! While Chika Tilman at Chikalicious in NYC may have started this concept, Sweets Raku has definitely elevated it...  We arrived at about 8pm to an already PACKED house and endured a 45 minute wait which was perfect because the spots that cleared up for our party of four were dead center at the bar, so we could see all the action! There have been some changes lately...a couple of pastry cooks have been added to assist Chef Mio and her assistant behind the scenes, especially during crunch time. The menu has undergone some changes too. The Marriage and Mt. Fuji desserts are still there...gone are the Apollo, Veil, and Ringo Desserts. They have been replaced by:  THE ANGEL CREAM-Fromage and Pear with white chocolate wings and a pulled sugar halo  THE BATON-Chocolate tuile cylinder filled with  chocolate cake, passionfruit gelee, chocolate and pistachio mousses and a pulled sugar ribbon.  RED ROCK(The newest dessert)-Raspberry and white chocolate fondant(or lava cake, whichever you prefer ;) with streusel, vanilla and pistachio ice cream, yuzu marshmallow, and vanilla tuile garnished with spun sugar.  We decided to share the Baton and Red Rock Desserts since at that time, they were out of the Angel Cream dessert,( which was back on the menu by the time we were finished). Again, we enjoyed both desserts which were artistically presented with great flavors and textures while not being tooth achingly sweet. I also enjoyed my Iced Latte which never tasted watered down thanks to a genius idea of a coffee ice cube!   Finishing out our sweet journey, the Chocolate Fondant has also been replaced by a crisp warm cream puff made to order with your choice of vanilla or chocolate cream flavored with your choice of ganache, black currant, or strawberry filling. I will repeat again that this is a DESSERT EXPERIENCE, and if your idea of dessert is off a dollar menu, or "$20 can feed the whole family" at places like Mickey D's, Wendy's, Jack in the Crack, or Sonic, don't even bother coming here, and step aside for those who seek this type of adventure.

4 Sweets Raku has a very calm, refined, and delicate atmosphere to it. This could be a turn off for some looking for a casual place to relax and chat it up with friends.   The menu is simple, light, and did I mention edible? Espresso is ok, but I was expecting something to wow me a bit more seeing how it coexists with their nature of business. Desert was never a big thing for me and this place just didn't quite excite my palate. I ordered the baton which was a new experience to me pistachio cream with a chocolate and fruit base all wrapped in a light delicate cookie. The flavors were subtle and weren't too overpowering, but I think I'll leave this place to the dessert lovers. The service here is exceptional although communication could sometimes be an issue, we had difficulties understanding the waitress when she was describing the menu.
3 They say to try everything once right?  Finally made it over to Sweets Raku with a few of my buddies to check out what the "red carpet" out front was all about.  First off, I like the decor of the place.  You are immediately greeted by a wall of wine, which looks fantastic peering in from the outside, and a few pieces of novel art work on the wall (and in the bathroom.. very neat) that sets the tone of the evening: relaxed and inviting.  It was a little warm for my taste but they were baking stuff right in front of you so I quickly disregarded.  Now, the food.  I like the concept of the menu in that once you order off of it, you can eat it.  They even provide some dipping sauce (raspberry on this occasion, I believe) for you to dip and munch.  Pretty cool in my book.  Opted for a cheese place because we came from an edomae place before we hit up sweets and I wasn't ready to grub anything too big.  Also divulged in a few glasses Sav Blanc to keep the party going and for pairing purposes as well.  Not too shabby and the cheese plate was a pretty good way to keep me at bay over casual conversation.  The part I liked most about the cheese plate actually wasn't the cheese.. it was the spiced pastry sticks that came with it.  I would've just snacked on that for the evening if I could order just that!  Easily the highlight of the culinary venture here.  I also tasted some pistachio ice cream, mango and yuzu marshmallows, and a little bit of the Red Rock cake to get in on a few of the flavors that they had to offer.  Everything was alright but nothing to write home (or Yelp) about.  I definitely liked the fact that it wasn't super sweet as I am not really a fan of overly sweet desserts, but, again, it was an ok experience with nothing that really stood out.  Service was good and I liked the fact that I can see the staff divvy up some dishes right in front of me.  I think the prices are reasonable and probably worth the experience but with everything factored in, I just wasn't feeling it.  Note: I'm a bit more partial to the other "face" of Raku around the corner but just couldn't hang with this place.  Probably would bring my wife to try it out and see if she would like it but it's just not enough to coax me back for any other outings.
4 Super cute location. Friendly & attentive servers. Delicious desserts! Definitely a change from the average. Great for date night. Not good for large parties since the place is tiny! We sat at the bar & were able to watch the desserts being prepared. Very cool experience!
4 Wow.  You know its special when the waiter says its time to eat your "menu" as she pours a splash if raspberry sauce on your plate.  Sweets Raku is so fabulous.  The course dessert prepped counter-side is such an amazing experience. Our citrus starter sorbet was a nice light intro to the main course dessert.  We tried the pistachio mouse, strawberry banana cake, angel cream and hazelnut cream cake.  Everything was spectacular.  Coffee was good as well.  I added a wine pairing for $7 (port) it was just as good.  For a lighter drink option - order the "apple green tea."   So worth the trip to Chinatown - especially if you are looking for non-touristy joints outside the strip. This whole strip mall is full of foodie options that you need to try.  I'll definitely be back.
5 That was the greatest find ever!! We went for valentines dessert and split a "trio" which is $24. An hour of desserts, entertainment (watching them bake) and cookies to bring home was very worth the money. I left thinking I should tip more, that was delicious, entertaining, and the workers are super sweet. I will definitely be going back!
4 Finally made my way over to the dessert destination in the city. And I do have mixed emotions, but for the most part this place is over-hyped! Yeah seriously I think you are just paying for the experience.  All the things they do in the open air kitchen is jaw dropping, which makes you think the dessert that will be served to you will be phenomenal. I came on a Saturday night with a friend and we waited about 45 minutes to be seated. We had dinner prior to coming, so we opted for the Ala Cart but we did consider getting the full course since you get more of your money's worth I guess. Thankfully we didn't because the desserts were nothing spectacular and to be honest they were average at it's best. I had the baton while my friend had the marriage. The baton was basically tasted like whipped pistachio with a chocolate shell. No flavors really stuck out. My friend described the marriage as those cake rolls with sliced up strawberry and banana, also another desert that was a let down. Yes, the ambiance is pretty amazing and sitting at the bar watching the open air kitchen is like a show in itself. Other than the desert they have everything going for them. I did hear the apple pie was pretty delicious, but unfortunately is no longer on the menu. Price is justifiable for overall experience and quality of desert, but I don't think I'll be coming back considering I can get pastries at bakery that are better tasting and for cheaper too. I'm just glad to get this sucker off my bookmark list and say I've been here to check out what the hype was all about.
4 - Just look for the big spoon a couple of doors down from Big Wong.  - Be prepared to wait.  - Try to sit at the bar if it's your first time.  My friends & I came here after dinner around 10:30PM on a week night during the holiday season. We were seated a little after an hour wait. It's a nice little setup.. you can sit at the bar & watch the girls make the desserts or you can sit at one of the 2-3 tables of 2-4 seats. Our party of 5 was lucky enough to snag a spot at the bar. We were entertained by the girls plating the desserts.  Once we were seated, the menu was explained to us. It's a prix fixe menu where you get 3 "courses" for $19. You get a starter, an entree (5 options available), & petit fours. OH! The menu (like everyone else has shared) is edible with raspberry dipping sauce. Nothing too exciting, but how many places can you say you've eaten the menu, right??   The amuse was a raspberry sorbet with mint jelly. Light, refreshing, can barely taste the mint. For our entrees, since there were 5 of us & 5 different entrees, we all picked one & tried each.   - Marriage: this was my favorite out of the 5.. a spongecake with banana custard inside and strawberry mousse on top with fresh berries.  - Baton: this looked like a chocolate silo filled a chocolate cake, topped with chocolate & pistachio mousse with a cute candied ribbon on top.  - Angel cream: fromage pear.. super pretty presentation! Delicious & light.  - Mt. Fuji: chestnut cream cake.. tasty, but too much cream for my liking.  - Ringo: another beautiful presentation! My second favorite: it is basically apple pie with with a candied apple filled with cream and a side of honey ice cream.   The petit four was a chocolate molten lava cake with dried fruit and marshmallows on the sides - would skip the fruit.   Overall, super cute dessert place where you don't have to feel bad about taking pictures of your food because everyone else is. ;)
5 This was one of the most unique dining experiences I have ever had! It is a bit pricey but the ambiance and the presentation makes it worth it!
4 This is very similar to an experience that you would have in Japan.   Even more so than Pâtisserie Chantilly in Southern California (which is my current japanese favorite).    So lets go to the review...  We had the prix fixe.    Loved the sorbet with muscat grape jelly (very popular in japan), mont blac with chestnuts (tastes home made), and cream puff was fresh with berry sauce.   Very well executed.   It is an experience.      If you want the best dessert experience in LV, this is it.
5 Sweets Raku is the Apple Store of the dessert world. Except I actually like this place.  Everything is white and clean. Your table is set with purpose and design harmony. You can watch your desserts being made at the counter (usually). You can take pictures of your food without feeling any shame - everyone else is.   You'll be handed an edible menu. This menu says you have two choices. You can do the pre-fixe 3-course dessert, or just order a la carte. Chances are you'll do the former. At least your first time.  For our visit, we sat at the bar - which is highly recommended. It's a fun place to be because you can watch the creation of art. Usually it's the second course you're going to see made. It's the second course you get to pick.  First course - a Japanese white peach sorbet with riesling jelly. So light and delicate in flavor that you'll start to savor each spoonful. You won't even make a spoonful anymore. It's a precious amount that is gone too soon.  Second course came in two flavors for two of us. In one corner, the "Baton." In the other "Mt. Fuji." We got to watch both under construction. The Mt. Fuji is primarily chestnut flavored. Layers of various chestnut-flavored things like a chestnut cake, actual bits of chestnuts, chestnut mousse, and chestnut frosting laid in a spaghetti-like coating. Light but distinct flavor. Soft texture throughout, and very mild in sweetness as well. The Baton was a sort of chimney made of a crispy chocolate shell. At the bottom, a chocolate cake, then raspberry, then chocolate mousse, and finally a pistachio mousse. Again, not too sweet. I enjoyed the mix of crispy and soft in the center. I liked this more than the Mt. Fuji.  Lastly a cream puff. You have your choice of chocolate or vanilla cream, and three different flavors of jam (that I can't remember). Both are injected into the fresh puff. Served with two flavored marshmallows - raspberry and passionfruit. I'm not a huge fan of cream puffs but the cream itself was very tasty. The marshmallows a bit out of place.  I really liked the absence of sweetness in pretty much everything. It's often too easy to make things "delicious" through pounds of sugar. Luckily, in their OCD nature regarding quality and perfection - this did not happen.  We also had two pots of tea. Both more fragrant than they were flavorful. But flavors were subtle enough to compliment the desserts.  Nothing overpowering.  There were a couple of hiccups. For example, we were half forgotten at first. We didn't get our first course for a while, and instead jumped to second. However, as soon as they realized it they fixed their mistake. Everything else was fast after that.  We'd certainly be back but probably not to do a pre-fixe deal. Price is a bit steep but it's kind of an experience more than a "value."
3 I have to say that I'm not a huge dessert person. I came here because I've heard so much about it and had to check it out.  first, the place is not very big. it had two tables and majority of seats are at the bar which is nice because they make all the desserts right in front of you. I had the fixed menu which is three courses (one of which you pick). I chose the hazelnut dish which looks like soba noodles. I have to admit that it looks pretty awesome. I thought it was ice cream but it's not which was a bit disappointing. it's really cool to see how they make it and I think that's part of what makes this place special... It feels quite intimate but it's really not.  the dishes aren't spectacular or memorable. would I recommend it? I would if they were really into desserts. would I go back in my own? probably not.  the staff is friendly and the place is super clean. the bathroom is an experience in itself, but if you've been to raku you'd know what I'm talking about.
5 Incredible tasting deserts presented in a beautiful artistic form.  Greatly thought out and executed.
5 Any place where I can eat the menu gets an A+ from me!   Such a neat little atmosphere with seating at the bar and three small tables. Be sure to sit at the bar so you can watch the chefs create amazing desserts from sugar and other delicious ingredients.   When you sit down, you are given an edible menu with a sugar ribbon. Don't eat it quite yet because they will give you a yummy raspberry plum sauce to dip it in.   First time here? You must get the three course dessert! It starts off with a yummy sorbet followed by the main course which is almost to pretty to eat! The last course varies on the season. The first time, mini chocolate cake or cheesecake and the second time was a stuffed pastry.
4 What a fun experience! I highly recommend it to anybody over the age of 8 or so. First of all, the ambiance is super cool. Is this what it's like in Japan? Not sure, but I like to think so. It's a small room decorated all in white, with about 10 seats at the 'bar' where you can watch a few of the desserts being made, and about 10 table seats. Warning: there is no signage! It's located between Kabuto and a massage place. The food menu (which is edible!), includes a 3-course prix fixe option or a 1-course option. The drink menu has an extensive selection of champagne and dessert wines, but unfortunately, these are all quite high-priced and there are very few by the glass selections. In addition, you can order from a wide variety of teas and several types of bottled Japanese water of various ph's. We tried the 'bicarbonate' one, which is supposedly for athletes. I could taste a slight difference from the tap water, but I'm not sure if it was worth $4! On to the main thing, the desserts! They were all delicious. Our amuse was a white peach sorbet with sparkling wine jelly and it was sooo good. Usually peach-flavored things are cloyingly sweet, but this was so light and delicious! The small beads of sparkling wine jelly perfectly complemented it. I could have eaten about 10 of these. For our 'main' dish we had the 'angel' (cookie with pear gel on top and covered with a pear foam) and the 'red rock' (raspberry molten cake with vanilla ice cream and yuzu marshmallows and some other stuff!). The angel was really good - light, with just a hint of pear - but the red rock was awesome! Seriously, I usually don't like 'molten' cakes because they're goopy and too sweet and the cake part is heavy, but THIS.....this was so good. And of all things, the yuzu marshmallows really stood out! It was disappointing that we only had 2! Our last dish was the cream puff. It was good and all, but small, and nothing too special. I would highly recommend everybody check out Sweets Raku at least once - it's a perfect date night! Add a bottle of dessert wine and you could even skip dinner! At $19 for the prix fixe menu, it's definitely more than you'd spend on typical dessert, but it's perfect for a special occasion. So why, you may ask, do I not give it 5 stars? Simply because it is waaayyyyy......toooooooo.....slllllloooowwww. Seriously, we were there over an hour! I appreciate that every dish is made by hand as it's ordered, but could you maybe hire another cook back there? At a pace like that, it's not really even good for kids. Ours held out to the end, but we ended up scarfing down the cream puff in 1 bite each since it was way past bedtime by that time.
4 Pastry chef of the year !!   Impressed with the immaculate service and keeping everything neat/clean/tidy. Sitting at the counter was like watching a harmonious symphony in action. The edible menu is definitely a interesting and unique start of the prefix menu. The amuse was refreshing and the desserts itself was pretty straightforward. They are generally on the lighter side of sweet catered to most people who favor less sweet desserts. wish they have more of these places. *smiLe*
5 This is my dining highlight of the past five years, and I am a food snob. Serendipity brought me here and I'll be talking about it for the rest of my life. Superb staff, their desserts are heavenly, the ambiance was perfect, the bathroom had me giddy with laughter, and you have to just applaud how they have taken a suburban parking-lot mall storefront and made you completely forget where you are by the artistic and lovely way they separate you from the outside world by a transparent wall of nice wines (including some Opus One). My dessert was not on the menu - they made is especially for me upon request because I had just come from dinner at Raku and was told that the dessert I ordered following dinner had been discontinued for some time but that if I came to Sweets Raku and asked them to make it they would know what I was asking for and might be able to accommodate. They did, and what a delight! To make this even better, since I am a coffee snob, I can report that the Americano they served me was excellent. The staff were all cute, perfectly dressed, and intimately knowledgeable about every ingredient that is part of their intricate dessert compositions. I reached a level of happiness while dining there - let's call it elation - that I carried with me well into the next morning. In my experience, that's rare and good cause for a five-star rating!
3 Oh how I wanted to love this place.   I love the concept. The kitchen is beautiful and contemporary. They're very organized and meticulous.  Definitely try sitting at the counter "bar" area to watch the action. Watching them use the different tools and equipment and technique was probably better than the actual dessert course.   I think the service needs some working out also.  Also the pace is super slow! Really how long does it really take to 1st course: scoop out some sorbet and ass champagne garnish and 3rd course: heat up a premade cream puff?   They could really do themselves a favor by adding another server, adding a host or hostess, or something. Either I went on an off night or I'm just missing something.  The girls tried to be sweet and tried to explain everything well but it didn't work for me. There was so much inconsistency with service.   Example: how about explaining the edible menu before the first course is almost coming out?  The sauce they serve with the rice paper menu is awesome.  I liked the price for the prix fix 3 course dessert tasting. I liked the desserts. I like the restaurant itself.   I wouldn't return any time soon. The whole "experience" was disappointing to me.
5 Loved our time at this place although we had a hard time finding it after eating at the excellant Raku (we didn't realize it was in the same plaza!). The place is kind of set up like Chikalicious in New York where you can order a three course dessert and watch them building it in front of you if you are sitting at the bar. The suprise starts when after ordering, they ask you to eat the menu with some delicious sauce. Desserts were delicate and beautifully presented. Will have to return to try more items.
4 You had me at edible menu.  Even if you aren't the biggest sweets fan, you will appreciate the experience. Nothing is obnoxiously sweet, my main dessert (angel cream) was light and subtle.  Price is very reasonable for the experience and presentation. To be honest, the restroom was one of the highlights for me.  All I'm going to say is there is an automatic toilet..  Service:  -Our server was so sweet and gave us in depth descriptions of each item.  -We sat at the bar to watch the pastry chefs do their thing.  Not only do they make everything look effortlessly artistic, they do so with ten customers staring intently at them!  Ordered:   -3 course prix fixe.   -Favorite was the amuse (first course) a melt-in-your-mouth strawberry sherbet w/ mint gelée. -Last course was a cream puff.  Not a big deal right? WRONG. It was the perfect temperature and you watch them inject fresh cream of your choosing into it.
5 I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! This place. I went once for something new ... Loved it. Then I went back to show a friend. The week after I took my sister. Today I took my other sister for her birthday and fell in love all over again. The service is EXCEPTIONAL! Someone is always attending to. They do a very good job explaining everything step by step. I am so thrilled I get to show my family and friends a unique place to eat for dessert. Also not be to inexpensive is even better!
5 Wow!  Spectacular.  This restaurant rivals any great place you'd find in NYC!  I appreciated the fun, whimsical, cool details like oversized wine glasses, crooked plates, red lego coasters, giant Raku spoon, and transparent wine bar.  I loved watching the desserts being made.  They are works of art.  Also, they tasted delicious and not too sweet.  I will be back!
5 Fantastic desserts. Between 5 of us we tried 4 of the desserts on the menu and they were all excellent. The chef is a true artist.
5 I'm not sure where to begin but to say OMG I LOVE YOU.   You enter, and there is a cute display of wines which is like a little wall separator. It was a Tuesday night, so they weren't too busy when we came so we were immediately seated at the bar. Awesome because you get to see the chef make everything (not from scratch of course but she puts it all together in front of you) You can even see her make the crystallized sugar as each order comes up! How cool is that?   Service is a little slow, but with such sweet girls serving us and a show in front, it was ok with me. You're given a plate with a scroll on it to unwrap where they'll explain the menu for you. after You've had time to look over the menu, they come around to pour their TO DIE FOR raspberry sauce to dip your EDIBLE menu with. this sauce...was heaven. I swear.   My BFF and I decided to go with 3 main dessert entree's instead of the 3 course meal just because we don't care for cream puffs much. But really, the 3 course meal is a score so it's your preference, we're just fatties like that.   I loved every dessert we tried. EVERYTHING. Each was amazing in their own way, but the Red Rock (lava flow) was one of my favorites and tops it on my list of favorite desserts. This surpasses Roy's Chocolate Souffle and if anyone knows me, you know I die and go to heaven with each bite of his souffle but this lava cake was the perfect mix of sweet and sour and light.   FYI: Mt. Fuki (chestnut cream cake) seems to be something thats always on the menu and their #1 seller. The couple next to us told us it was the most amazing dessert they've ever had (next to red rock) so when i'm back in Vegas, i'll be there to try this dessert.   They don't take reservations here but if you're going on a weekday, they'll most likely have a table open or the wait isn't that long. But it is wroth the wait. Also, the desserts are $12 for just the entree and $19 for the 3 course. The chef is from Japan and if anyone knows anything about the Japanese, they're talented when it comes to food and what makes it perfect for my palate is that they know how to use sugar and not let the sugar be the main object of the piece. (it's not overly sweet, but just perfect. I really hate desserts that taste mostly of sugar and nothing else because that's how most people in America like their dessert)
5 This is must go for dessert in LV!!! The desserts look so beautiful and taste sooooo wonderful!! I must go every time when I back to LV!!
5 This must be the definition of 'culinary arts'. Our party of four was heading toward a table when the staff suggested that we sit at the bar around the open prep area.  This was good advice - our conversations trailed off as we watched the chefs at work.    From the delicate candy thread-wrapped edible rice paper menu (raspberry dipping sauce served after ordering) to the plating embellishments (placed Just So), the charming details were executed with intense precision.  The desserts themselves were layer upon layer of harmonizing texture and flavor.  Consider the $19 prix fixe / $12 a la carte pricing as an entrance admission for edible performance art.
4 Love the interior of this restaurant. But didn't like that 1 order per person or sharing charges apply policy. I ordered 2 a-la-carte cake for us and enjoyed both. It was baton? (I believe so) and Mt.Fuji. $12 for each piece and it's just little bit over priced in my opinion but since it's unique style dessert cafe in vegas, still being loved well ;-)
5 It is nothing new, I had something similar in NYC and Tokyo, but this place is a bit better since they offer a wide variety of wines and teas!!! Their desserts are originals and creatives. For those whiners, the place is small with a limited space, you go there to enjoy the chef's creativities and the food, you don't just go there and sit to take up their space and not allowing other paying patrons to get in, so the surcharge for your non eating plus 1 is reasonable. Highly recommend for take your date there to impress them! Get a seat by the counter to watch the dessert chef making your edible artworks right in front of you is mesmerizing!
4 I really think the whole experience of this restaurant was dulled because I knew what to expect from reading the reviews. This would be the first time I have ever wished I went to eat without knowing anything about a restaurant. It was good, not the best dessert ever, but I would go again to take out of town friends for the experience.
5 Sweets Raku is awesome and such a unique dining experience! I came here with a few friends for dessert and we absolutely loved it. The dessert was beautifully presented and tasted beyond amazing. Also, the service was impeccable! I will definitely return!
4 This place is absolutely a treat.... Great dessert section portions are perfect bite. I had wine paring with mine
5 The dessert shop where you can (literally) eat the menu.  What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said?  This is THE place for gorgeous and delectable desserts.  It's literally dessert and a show.  I try to come back as often as I can.  They've started selling Asian style cake rolls (Swiss rolls) to go, a different flavor each week or so.  I got the Japanese cherry blossom flavor and it is TDF.  Even their to go dessert was expertly prepared to order and wrapped with care.  I love this place and try to bring everyone I know here.
5 This place is amazing !!!! If you live in vegas you gotta come here at least once it is so cool and amazing. Great service and great food.
5 Why does this place deserve 5 stars? Because it's an experience you won't forget.  From the moment you walk into this stark white establishment with cool decor to watching the pastry chefs prepare your 3 course dessert menu (if you don't go a la carte) to using their funky bathroom, this place is just very unique. I can't compare it to any other place.  I got the pre fixe menu ($19) which comes with AN EDIBLE MENU that you dip into a raspberry sauce, an amuse and petit fours for just $7 more than getting is a la carte. I picked the Mt. Fuji chestnut cream cake because I was so mesmerized by the way the chefs were making it. It looked like ice cream spaghetti. But it was cream...which was good, but it definitely would have been better if it was ice cream.  My husband chose the Baton which had chocolate and pistachio mousse over a chocolate sponge cake and red wine sauce. The outside was made out of a thin chocolate layer. It was beautiful, really hard to eat, toppled over, and attacked. Taste wise, I thought it was better than the Mt. Fuji.  The Sorbet amuse was a good palate cleanser but the cream puff petit four was seriously so amazing. The cream puffs were heaven. I barely took a pic of it before it disappeared into my mouth.  Of course out of all these things, the most impressive was the edible menu. As soon as they present it to you, you know you're in for a nice treat for the rest of the dessert experience. Could it all have tasted better? Yes. But because it was a unique experience that just makes people happy, I think it deserves 5 stars. I dare you to bring a sour puss in here and see if he/she doesn't come out with a smile on his/her face.
5 Pretty little place with great dessert! Good coffee too! Totally new experience for dessert. :)
5 This is not just a restaurant it's an experience! From the amazing and beautiful desserts to the lovely staff and the clean environment ! My favorite dessert has to be the angel cream. It is a very light dessert with just the right amount of sweet with out being overpowering. The cream puffs are also some of the most delectable I have ever had. They are so light and airy with your choice of chocolate or vanilla cream and strawberry or raspberry jam. Everything is prepared right in front of you and the staff is just so great and attentive. I have yet to be disappointed when coming here.
4 Eating here was such a unique experience. Since I'm a huge fan of Raku, the dessert next door was a place I had to check out. I went here not expecting anything much, except to be at a typical dessert cafe. Boy, was I wrong.   The decor is modern and hip, with a glass wall of bottles along the entry way. Everything's in white and the open kitchen that's set up with the best tools from All-Clad and the cutest utensils resembles my dream kitchen.   I got the pre fixe menu ($19). If you share this pre-fixe menu, they bump up the price. So for whatever, reason the calculations added up so that it was best for my bf and I to get one pre fixe menu plus 1 a la carte item.   First, the menu was edible. Without having read the reviews, my instincts kicked in, and I asked the waitress if the menu was edible to which she responded, "try it." I smelled it and licked it and then thought they were playing some practical joke on me so I stopped, feeling really embarrassed. I'm glad I was wrong.   I ordered the Red Rock. I for some reason expected a chocolate flavor but it was something else. The cream puff was just an OK for me.   The other additional a la carte was the Mt. Fuji (chestnut cream cake) which is one of the most popular cakes in Japan. Since I've grown up all my life eating this cake, I was a bit disappointed in the flavor. Normally the chestnut cream is yellowish as it's more condensed. Here, I think they use less and I couldn't taste the chestnut as much.    i think the best part of my dessert dish was the yuzu marshmallows. I was so amazed by the taste as well as texture.   The tea was awesome. Can't remember which one I had, but I don't think you can go wrong. I'm still curious about going back to try the other chocolate tower cake as well as the water that's imported from Japan.   In terms of creativity this place is a solid 5 star. I knocked one star off just because the taste wasn't up to par as the appearance/presentation of the desserts. (I hear the booing. Forgive me, but I'm keeping it real)
5 Awesome dessert place... My and my husband couldn't think anywhere else beside this place when it comes to dessert. A must try one
5 Fellas, your Date Night will not be all it could be without ending at Sweets Raku. Girls love sweet things and they love fancy stuff. This is both and happily it won't empty your wallet!  You are greeted when you come in and everyone that works there is super nice! There are only a few tables and seating at the counter - and they do not take reservations FYI. They have real food like a few sandwiches and quiches but you really want the dessert. Either the 3 course prix fixe for $19 or a solo dessert for $12. A little expensive maybe but it's worth it based on the artistry, experience, and obviously the taste.   I got the Angel Cream and would highly recommend it. It's light but flavorful with pear and other goodness I can't really explain. Like all the others it's really fun to look at before you eat it!
4 Loved the decor of this little dessert restaurant!  It was very difficult to pick a main course because everything sounded so delicious. I recommend going with a couple of people so everyone can order something different and share. That works for indecisive people like me! Everything I tried was wonderful.
5 This place was amazing because of the staff, design, and food. I enjoyed the attentive waitress and concept art of each dish. Sometimes these places would be somewhat creative and unique and the food wouldn't be that impressive, but this wasn't the case. I was awed when I walked in because of the intriguing design of the interior. Overall I enjoyed it to go again.
5 I feel like they've thought of everything. The décor is so bright and clean. The staff are so friendly. They make the desserts in front of you and are smiling the whole time they're making them. There are about 5 desserts to choose from...just wish there was more than one chocolate item to choose from. You can also order a wine flight with your dessert. You can choose from a single dessert or the 3 course dessert. I highly recommend this place. Great place to bring out of town guests.
5 Boyfriend surprised us with this dessert place after sushi dinner. This place is a hidden gem! Literally, you would walk right by it if you were in this plaza. Definitely a place only locals know. Once you go past the dark doors and walls you enter this amazing bright white room, with a massive wall of a fully stocked wine cellar!  The staff were super friendly and diligent. The menu is edible! I don't want to say too much and spoil it for those who haven't been but this place is definitely an experience!! Great dessert place!! Check it out!!
5 Unbelievably cool concept .. dessert creations from a decorated Japanese pastry chef .. We enjoyed the prix fixe menu (yes, the menu is edible) which included mango sorbet, strawberry tiramisu, chestnut cream cake, and a puff pastry ..all went amazingly well my illy cappuccino .. vibe is very artistic with all food made directly in front of you, this place has to be tried at least once
5 If I had to pick one place that I would take my friends visiting Vegas to, I would name Sweets Raku. And I actually did.  The experience here is exceptional. Starting with the famous edible menu, you get to see the pâtissier Mio at work in front of you from start to finish to prepare your meal. Yes I just said it a meal, you could just skip the dinner for the dessert here, it's that good!  Competitors? Practically none, but pâtissier at top-notch French restaurants like Joël Robuchon might be said comparable. At least personally I can't decide.  Also they recently began savory menu for lunch weekends, and as you might expect, those dishes are stellar as well.  Highly recommended would be an understatement - a must try!
3 I really liked the concept / presentation of this place and it was definitely a good experience for date night. It was fun to sit at the bar and watch the ladies prepare all the desserts.   My boyfriend and I both ordered the prix fixe menu, which included an amuse bouche (mango sorbet), a main course (we chose red rock and the stella), and a cream puff (cream + jam of your choice).  Service as alright. When we came in there weren't many people there so they seated us promptly, but then we had to sit there awkwardly for a little while. A drink list was brought out. They asked us what we wanted to drink, but I ended up not ordering any wine because I wanted to see what the desserts were before I decided. There's a $7 wine tasting pairing that you can get with the dessert, so I ended up doing that since they had already taken the drink menu away. Since only one person is preparing the dessert, my main course came out well before my boyfriend's. Since it had some ice cream / gelato / something frozen on the side, I wanted to eat it before it melted. His came out after I finished. They also forgot about my wine pairing, so they comped it. I think the entire glass with wine had also been in the refrigerator.   The dessert was also alright. Nothing phenomenal, but very pretty. Good for an occasion, but I won't be rushing back here just to eat.
5 By far my ALL TIME fave place for brunch and best of all DESSERT! Definitely a recommendation to anyone who loves dessert or not. Grade A+ from service, to ambiance and most importantly the food! I could go on and on about how awesome this place is but I think it's best that you go in and check it out yourself! Seats are limited and no reservations, walk-ins only. :)
5 A great spot to take a date after dinner. I took my wife there last week after dinner. It's a small intimate place in a non-descript strip mall (which interestingly has a few other great finds: Raku sushi, Monta Noodle shop).  Definitely have the prix fix menu. It changes monthly so be prepared to go back again and again. I won't give it all away but the desserts are wonderful!  Definitely sit at the counter and watch them make everything in front of. They have a great selection of wines that pair with each dessert. If I wasn't so full, I would write an even more elaborate review. It's a must go to in the city that has so much to offer!
5 Awesome! Thanks Dad!
5 Really fun place.  You can eat the menu!  The desserts are soooo good and not too sweet.  Desserts are also beautiful.  If you sit at the bar you can watch them make the desserts.  Service is great, really nice.  Decor is very clean and nice.  The bathroom is super clean.  Made me so happy to use such a clean bathroom.  Definitely check out the bathroom.
3 Presentation gets 5 stars, taste more of a 3-3.5 stars. Was hoping the flavors would blow me away more, but the experience was still great.   This is in the same shopping center as Raku the regular restaurant, but Sweets Raku is towards the front of the parking lot! We were confused at first and didn't know they were difference restaurants.   FOOD: Red rock (4 stars): Raspberry and white chocolate go so well together. The raspberry sauce is really good. My favorite dish out of the ones I tried. The sauce in the cake part is nice and warm too. All the textures work really well together.   Baton (3.75 stars) Couldn't taste any pistachio in the dish. The chocolate cake with what tasted like a raspberry or wine like sauce at the bottom was really rich and good! The passion fruit gelee bits were also good. You can't taste all the individual flavors together though, I had to specifically look for each component to get that flavor. But I did like the chocolate wafer it was covered in.   Stella (3 stars): My least favorite. Definitely not a tiramisu. More of a strawberry tart.   Calbri (3.5): If you love fruits and mango you should get this one. Very pretty dish and great presentation. The most fun to get because they poor a sauce over the chocolate covering the glass. But the dish is not so pretty once you start eating it because the glass starts getting smeary and you can't see what you're eating from the sides of the glass anymore. It had a lot of components but you mostly taste mango.   Such beautiful presentation. It's a great experience, makes you feel fancy in Chinatown. I love food art so I had a great time seeing the beautiful dishes come out. The flavors just didn't live up to the presentation. Each dessert was $12 and each person needs to order one. I just didn't feel like all the flavors in the description came out in each dish. I have the biggest sweet tooth and I love desserts, so I am a little more picky about them being perfect.   ATMOSPHERE: Very pretty restaurant. You can sit at the bar and watch them make the desserts. They first come out with edible menus which was really cool. They give you a yummy raspberry sauce to dip it in. And I had to check out the bathroom after reading reviews on here. It is a really nice bathroom, haha, so check it out as you wait.   SERVICE: Our waitress was really nice. I noticed when someone was about to walk in the door they say something out loud to let the waitress know to come out and greet them. So service is important to them. They also put a cute chocolate sign that said happy father's day on one of the desserts for a father when we came in on father's day, so nice.
5 Awesome place.  Clean modern and fun.  It's tiny but nice.  The dessert chefs are so skilled and fun to watch!  We loved the teas they offered and the desserts are great.  Not too sweet and very innovative.!
5 I'm a huge fan of Raku so it was only a matter of time before I would stop by Sweets Raku to check out their confectionery creations.  This was by far one of the most impressive culinary experiences I've ever had in Vegas.  Although you can order ala carte here, their 3-course pre-fixe menu is the way to go.  Here's how mine went:  Edible Menu -- http://bit.ly/1mhBL8B First off, this came as a surprise to me.  What an interesting concept for a quick appetizer.  They provide you with a raspberry dipping sauce.  Just remember to make sure you order first before eating your menu.  Daily Iced Tea with Muscat Ice Cube --  http://bit.ly/1p0YITQ Another twist!  The Iced Tea was good but the Muscat Ice Cube made it enjoyable.  I actually couldn't wait for that whole cube to melt down.  Pineapple Sorbet with White Wine Jelly -- http://bit.ly/1tNghV9 Amuse Bouche course.  This was a good start to the sweets meal.  Not overly sweet and had a refreshing taste to it.  Stella - Strawberry Tiramisu --  http://bit.ly/1p0ZDDH Main Course.  I'm glad that they provided pictures on their menu because this looked amazing on the pic, but it was an even bigger treat watching them create it from scratch.  I've never had a Tiramisu with strawberries before so this was a pleasant surprise.  The presentation was very creative and of course it was delish!  Creme Puff with Vanilla Cream and Black Currant Syrup -- http://bit.ly/1mhGvek Petit Four course.  I'm always a sucker for a good cream puff.  So I was glad to see they made this the final course.  You do have a choice of cream and syrup and I thought my choice of Vanilla and Black Currant went very well together.  Again, spot on with the presentation!  If you enjoy Raku like me, I'm pretty sure you'll be thoroughly impressed with Sweets Raku.  Like its older sibling, the service, presentation, and quality desserts are impeccable and as stated earlier, it's always a treat just to see the desserts being created right before your eyes.  Definitely worth another visit!  5 Stella Stars!
5 The entrance is hidden and tucked away. Once you enter there is a monumental wall of assorted dessert wines. The decor is white and crisp with bright lighting to accent the colorful creations. The furnishings are very chic and gives me a sense of elegance. Immediately we are greeted politely by the staff and seated at the bar. The venue in itself is very small reminiscent of a home kitchen but it's perfect for a sweet craving. We are presented the drink menu which is quite extensive from bold reds to sweet sparklings. I was very impressed with their assortment of mineral and sparkling waters. Not to mention, they also have tea and coffee service on their menu as well. Pretty SWEET, I was already infatuated by now. They have a set menu in which is seasonal and also prix fixe menu. My group and I opted to order the set items since we wanted to try the main items. The prix fixe menu is indeed edible accompanied by raspberry purée. Out of the seasonal items: angel cream pear fromage and the coco Caribe panna cotta were the standout items. Presentation was beautiful and it just melted in your mouth. None of the creations were heavy and each flavor was accented and unraveled with each bite. The strawberry tiramisu was pretty mediocre but everything else was quite the indulgence. It's off the strip and quaint, perfect for a summer night date!
4 Presentation and experience are amazing! Small quaint place with a very clean modern décor. The staff and service was very friendly and interactive.
2 Me and the wife have been wanting to go here since they opened and yes finally we got there. First of all this place has no damn sign so it's nearly impossible to find this place. We were looking around for 10 min in the plaza until we found it.  I have to say the place is very nicely put together reminds me a little bit of Bottega Louie in LA but that's where it stops.  It was pretty cool to eat the menu.... yes they are edible.  I could not understand 80% of what the waitress was saying now that's a problem so I let my wife handle it. We ordered the pre-fix dessert which was 3 courses.  I have to say I was truly disappointed by the flavors. They just add too much ingredients for one item. They should use simpler the better method. It looked like confusion and tasted like confusion.  All four of us didn't like it so we won't be going back!
5 This place is in the same shopping center as monta and raku, but it's on the west side of the three corners and is under no signage until you get to their door you will see a big silver spoon.  Just a heads up because first time I ever went I was confused if the GPS took me to the right place and couldn't find it immediately.  Ok now that is done, this place is such a wonderful experience! They don't just have desserts, but also have appetizers, quiches, and sandwiches.  I have had the crab quiche and the salmon croissant, I prefer the flavors of the croissant I had the best.   The salmon is cooked perfect and has a great sauce, nice greens, and ikura!  Both came with a soup and dessert.  I got the lobster tomato soup each time, it's served in a tiny cup and so yummy.  Salad is greens in a light citrus dressing and potato salad.  The desserts are wonderful to watch being made, and if it's someone's birthday they will malwnit extra special.  I have had the red tiramisu, and the Carib served in the big wine class.  My favorite was the carib it had so many flavors and textures that meld together into something amazing!  The foi gra pate is also amazing and I highly recommend it.  Their bathroom is pretty cool, but I do wish there was a purse hook, and while the sink is cool it kinda splashes every where.  The restaurant itself is super clean, modern, and fresh.  I can't wait to got again!  Oh and heads up if you bring someone who doesn't plan to order, regardless if they share food, there is a 5 dollar plate sharing fee. Probably to cover the edible menu at the beginning.
5 ** AMAZING DESSERT **  = LOCATION = SWEETS RAKU is located inside a small plaza in Las Vegas Chinatown.  It's located in the same plaza as RAKU (the ramen spot), but it is hard to find because they do not have any signs up.    = AMBIANCE = I love the simple and clean feel to this location, white tiles, white walls, white chair, a nice display of wines, and a beautiful open kitchen where you can watch Mio Ogasawara (2013 Pastry Chef of the Year) and her assistant create the desserts right in front of you.   = DESSERT = As noted by many Yelpers, their menu is edible, and I love dipping it into the raspberry sauce and devouring my edible menu after I made my selection.  The 3 course Prix Fixe is $19, and you can choose the main course from the 5 choices  given.  Alternatively, you can choose just one dessert for $12.   I ordered the Prix Fixe with Strawberry Tiramisu, each course was beautifully decorated and made in front of us.  Everything is perfect and not too sweet.  = NOTE = * Sharing Fee/ Split Fee is $5 * The dessert is on the light side, if you are someone that like stuff that is extremely sweet, this might not be the spot for you.
4 We dined at Herbs & Rye and made it a point NOT to get dessert there. That's usually very out of the question, but on this particular occasion, an anticipated three course dessert was reason enough.  Three courses of dessert?! Yup.  I had only imagined the concept in my fondest of thoughts.  My girl friend had been here before and was excited to bring me. I think I was really way more excited than she was.   We came in and got lucky there was a spot for two at the bar open. The place itself, it's very clinical and contemporary with its stark white walls and decor. The ladies manning the fort were friendly and kept up with the diners' oohs and aahs. Oh and endless photo-taking.   We each opted for the three or maybe four course dessert which came with dessert wine. Even the menu was edible. I surely loved that little touch! Each course was meticulously prepared and artfully presented.   Now these aren't your fattening, carbloady desserts. Surprisingly each course was light, airy, but still satisfying that sweet tooth.  Each course was a curious surprise waiting to unravel.   We both had an amazing time and I can't wait for a similar concept to be brought to CA.
5 Very Cool experience! Great nightcap for a date. The desserts were delicious! We had the red rock and the Carib. The staff was fun and inviting! I can't wait to go here again! Absolutely delicious! Even the menu is edible!!
5 It doesn't get much better!  The experience from edible menu to watching the sugar webs be spun was awesome!  We split two main course desserts (2 people) and they were amazing.  Everything else we saw our neighbors order looked equally enjoyable.  This will be a regular spot for me.  Wait to sit at the bar, you will thank me later.    Highly recommend!
2 In a word.... NOPE!   Katie M's review was EXACTLY how i felt about this place after i read it on my phone after departing from this place. Of course i noticed all the good reviews first, and i am a little disappointed and find it hard to believe that this many people really think the flavors and execution here was worth the money and hype.   Here is a hint for people going that are planning to share the pre fixe menu it says that its $19..but if your sharing then its $24. Your better off getting two of the main desserts at $12/each and not taking the 1st and 3rd items from the pre fixe given that they are not large portions or really anything special. Same money but you get more for the money..   I don't want to repeat the same thing that few others have said... yes the place is clean, yes the desserts "look" nice, and its a nice concept...yada yada. But the flavors just do not jive, and in some cases it seems there is just too much going on to really appreciate the dessert.   What i will add that not others have said is that i don't see the passion in this chef when making these creations one bit. Im very big on taking my business and money to a place who really enjoys what they are offering to their customers, and although the presentation is lovely, i don't see the chefs heart in the finished product. She is not very delicate, nor interactive at all, and i wasn't even enjoying watching her work since the look on her face wasn't as if she was even enjoying herself. She looked more of like an assembly line worker who was just "going through the motions" and throwing something together to get an end product and not a work of art or beautiful creation. I wanted to like this place... but it falls far short as i have easily had better desserts for a 1/4 of the cost and from a restaurant and not a dessert specific location like this.
5 Prix Fixe, $19  1. Amuse (Mandarin Sorbet with Raspberry Jelly) 2. Today's Dessert* 3. Petit Four (vanilla cream puff with black current)  Strawberry & Vanilla Green Tea Angel Cream (Fromage Pear)*  Muscat Black Tea Red Rock (Raspberry Fondant)*  I am just so very impressed with Sweets Raku. It's a fantastic experience and definitely makes for a special night, whatever the occasion. The restaurant is comprised of thoughtful, detailed designs. The spoons, the tea cups, everything is pristine without feeling sterile. Maybe it's "all the good smells" (as my companion says), but you feel welcomed.  None of our desserts were on a heavy-sweet side, which is something I prefer. We were super fond of our tea choices. The flavors were true to name. A funny thing, we thought the Strawberry & Vanilla tea tasted like the instant oatmeal!
