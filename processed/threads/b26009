5 The front person is great! And if you want an excellent cut, ask for Jodel. He's hard to book but definitely worth it.
3 This place is located inside of Seafood City which was an alarming surprise for me. It's definitely not a glamorous salon. But I desperately needed a haircut so I sucked it up and went with it. My hair was cut by Nemi who was entertaining and, like every hair stylist before him, appalled at the length of time I wait in between haircuts. He didn't subject my hair to the trauma of a flat iron, which I appreciated, and worked hard to make my hopelessly unstylish self look a little bit more styled.
