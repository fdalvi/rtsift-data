5 I couldn't be more pleased with ProFitness! The facility is clean and non intimidating. Jason is tough and will push you (safely) to your limits, all the while keeping you motivated to be the best you can be.  He tells you like it is and will have you doing things you would never, ever do on your own.  He's really helped me take control of my life - both physically and mentally for optimum fitness, health and overall well being.  Final word - Jason is a top notch personal trainer who's happy, but never satisfied!!!
5 I have been working out with personal trainer Jason Ingram for over 3 years now. I really appreciate the fact that he takes the time to get to know what fitness goals I have for myself.  He then creates workouts and meal plans to help achieve those goals and is encouraging each time I go through a session with him. I respect the fact that he lives his fitness life the way he expects you to live yours.  In other words, he doesn't just talk the talk, he walks the walk as well. He continually encourages you to make your best even better! I feel I am in the best shape of my life at 40 - thanks Jason!  He is also great at helping to train for marathons & triathlons as well as sports & endurance training for pre-teens & teenagers.
