4 This is my favorite Taco Bell location. I am obsessed with Taco Bell and their Baja Blast.  The employees are always so nice and efficient which is hard to find at a fast food joint. Love it!  Five stars on customer service.
1 This is the worst Wendy's i've ever been to
5 I come here about once a week, and the employees are always courteous.  The food is great!  I lost it when I found out that you can no longer order Baja Chicken Chalupa's off the menu, but this place will custom make them for you, no charge, and you can even keep the sour creme on it if you're into that sort of thing.  Five stars for keeping the customer first priority!
