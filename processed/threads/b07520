5 I have been a customer of this location for some time and the food has always been great. The thing I want to mention here is how they handle things when something is wrong. Recently I went through the drive through and ordered two steak Tostada salads, my mom's favorite,  when I got home I discovered that they had been made as chicken tostada salads, I called back and spoke with the Manager,Francisco, and he was very apologetic and took my name and told me to stop in whenever I wanted and he would buy my mother and I replacement salads at no charge.  A week went by and I went in and could not get over how pleasant The manager was and how he really cared that a mistake had been made and that he wanted to correct it.  this place is great and they really do care that their customers are Happy, something i think is valuable in this modern world.  I will continue to go here knowing that if a mistake is made i will be taken care of by a staff that makes me feel like I matter.
2 This is no Pollo Feliz from Tucson.  The chicken had a good flavor but the beans and salsa left little to be desired.  It is another run of the mill chain that cranks out orders of already prepared stuff...boring!
2 slow, slow, slow!
5 I have heard of this place a few times, and always thought it was fried chicken. I was wrong, and it was good! I came right at close, (Sorry guys, I know you all hate that.) going using the drive-thru. The woman was polite and courteous.  The chicken tasted like regular rotisserie chicken, no mexican flavor. The mashed potatoes were creamy as well as the gravy. (Reminded me of Church's Chicken mashed potatoes.) Corn on the cobb was good.
4 Happy and friendly employees and great food.  The best chicken anywhere.
2 The food was not what you order. As my sister put it, "the tacos weren't tacos, they were soggy burritoes." Also bathrooms did not provide soap which worries me that staff may have not been washing their hands before working.  -AWMRA
