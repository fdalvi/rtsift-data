5 I highly recommend specialized flooring. We went to several stores around Phoenix including Costco and their prices did not compare. Also the other stores could not get the carpet in for 4 to 6 weeks. Specialized flooring installed my carpet within 10 days. They worked all day to get it installed. It looks and feels beautiful. Please check them out.
5 I met with Mike a few months ago and he helped me choose some flooring for my home.  Their prices are great and because they are in the NW valley it was easy for me to check out their selection at their showroom nearby.  They delivered when they promised and got the job done quickly.  They even took good care of a repair for me while they were onsite.
5 This is the third project I have done with Specialized Flooring. To say I am thrilled with the results is an understatement. Granite countertops, tiled inside and out and next month a new shower tub/shower. Can't wait. Everyone showed up when they said they would and were very careful installing the new products. You can't go wrong with Specialized Flooring!
5 Great company to work with. Installation was quick, on time and craftsmanship perfect. Will be back for other rental property upgrades and my own home. The installers this company has are artists and perfectionists. Totally satisfied. Thanks for a great job Specialized Flooring.
