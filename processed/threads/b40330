5 WOW, talk about a gorgeous gym!!! You have to check this place out, you will be glad you did!!! This is one of the best crossfit gyms I have seen. Phenomenal coaches.  Checkout their free Saturday WOD if you want to check it out first...
5 Beautiful box! Coach Adrian was great. Everyone was so welcoming and helpful. I strongly recommend this place!
5 WOW! Where to start?! I did my homework and visited a few gyms before deciding on one. Power In Motion was the next one on my list, and where I stopped my research. y You will not find a better place to workout!!! The coaches are experienced coaches, not just instructors. The foundation with mastering techniques is like no others, so injuries are prevented. The camaraderie has changed my world. The workouts are perfectly adapted for all levels, in and out of the box. Proper diet is also part of the training, They even have therapists on staff. This is a gorgeous place, always clean. I LOVE IT!!!! I absolutely recommend it!!!
