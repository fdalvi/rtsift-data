1 horrible company, do not do business with this company!!!!
1 Went through my home warranty. They were so rude. When they called to contact me I was only contacted me once. When I called to reschedule I spoke to a girl Aileen or Eileen who was extremely rude to me. I asked her to reschedule for me, and she asked me when was good for me. I said tomorrow. She said "Well u didn't answer your phone so now were booked all day tomorrow." Okay well then you let me know when u guys are available. Don't ask me and give me a rude answer. I hung up and went with another company. What ever happened to being friendly. Never doing business with them again.
5 Moved to Vegas Aug 2013 and A/C wasn't working - talk a bout HOT - well this company came to my rescue - fast response - determined the problem and after getting the parts - worked FANTATIC -  Winter 2013 - ok talk about freezing temps in Vegas not what I expected - and furnace went out - you guessed it - called Ice Cube Air - again FAST response had it up and running same day.  Ran into the tech at the store asked me how things were - was great to be remembered so just have to give them a GREAT YELP
5 what an awesome experience !!! i was expecting the worst when my heating went out recently, and to my surprise the tech that arrived at my house was very professional, and explained things very thoroughly to me in a way that i could understand. his name was jesse and i said that if i ever needed to have service on my heater or ac again i would certainly request him.. and the ladies that i spoke with in office are all nice.
