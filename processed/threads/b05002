4 Hair salons are based on hair stylist. I like this hair salon since it has over the years good quality hair stylist. My last experience was great, to be honest I though my stylist was having a bad day. She was rough with my hair and her body language screamed I don't want to be here but I can be wrong and she was definitely pleasant. The mood seemed to change when the owner walked in which happens to a lot of businesses. In the end though she cut my hair and I love it. Its a new style for me but everyone who has seen it loves it, much better than my long Darth Vader helmet I have been rockin'.   Past experiences were not so great. I am not kidding but I had a hair cut that took 5 minutes. She didn't even do anything. She didn't do what I asked and overall I wasn't happy with the style and I have had my hair cut from her two times and both were terrible. She is still their at the salon but I was fortunate she wasn't there. I will definitely go back but I will try to avoid her. From now on I am going to call ahead and wait for Nina, she was awesome and in the end her work was incredible.
5 Went to style 5 after searching hi & low for a hairstylist that cut African American hair.....nina cut my hair she was really nice & friendly.....I was in & out....definitely will be coming back.....thanx Nina......prices are really good too!
4 I moved here in 11/2013 and was concerned about finding a talented person to trim my hair.  I was fortunate to go to Dori on my first try.  She trimmed my hair exactly as I requested and the results are great.  Next time I might be more adventurous and ask her to be free and use her imagination.
