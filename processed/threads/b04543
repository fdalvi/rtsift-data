3 Located in the old Bashas shopping center on the NW corner of 67th ave. & Deer Valley.  This is one of the cleaner DQ's in the valley, and it always has an upbeat feel because of the jukebox playing music constantly.  Service has been alright each visit, though some of the patrons are a bit difficult to look at.   I know, I know, it's just a DQ but this one isn't so bad.
3 Great for a quick Blizzard fix. My son loves the burgers I haven't tried the food besides the blizzard
3 What I like about this DQ is they have a machine with rubber balls in it for .25c and my six year old niece always asks to go so she can add a few balls to her collection. Love the blizzards.
1 Had a bad experience here. We ordered 2 small dipped cones and one of them was EXTREMELY small. When I told the girl at the window, she just took the cones with an attitude and closed the window. Another girl came to the window and I explained that one of the cones was really small and she said that they "weigh" the cones. We were regular customers so we know what small cones are supposed to look like...and this cone was even smaller than a child size cone. They didn't offer to re-do the one cone, so I just offered to pay extra to upgrade to a medium. The original girl came back to the window, charged us for the additional amount for the larger cones and handed us the two cones...and one of them was STILL much smaller! She just handed the cones to us with a pissy look and closed the window. No apology, she didn't say "thank you" like most drive thru staff would do....just an attitude. She clearly had no social skills and shouldnt be dealing with customers. As she was closing the window, I told her that she doesn't need to have an attitude. At that point, she opened the window and told me that she doesn't have an attitude. I'm usually very tolerant, but being in customer service myself, I just cant tolerate rudeness.
