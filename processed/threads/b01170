2 I kept getting suckered by the coupons, but I've stopped going here since whenever they "fix" something, I often find myself at 25th St Automotive a few weeks later getting it permanently fixed.  But, they do free brake inspections and if you make sure they install OEM brake parts instead of advertised specials which WILL squeek badly then BM can be a good option.  For that service alone I wouldn't write them off.
5 brought the 4Runner in @ 2 on a Saturday, had it back @ 5:30. I knew the roters were warped, i needed an oil change, and I had a brake light out. They called with a few options on the brakes, changed the oil and brake light, and didn't try and sell me a bunch of other add ons. Friendly service and did what needed to be done.
5 great shop...manager Craig is fair and knowledgeable....saved me a bunch of money!!! I've had all three of our BMW's in there for service..!  Mike
4 Went there for an oil change recently.  Didn't know if there's going to be a wait time so I called ahead and make an appointment.  In and out of the store in under 30 minutes.  Great service and friendly staffs.
4 Fast, efficient and honest service. A bit pricey, but the shop nearby would have taken three hours minimum and cost more.
