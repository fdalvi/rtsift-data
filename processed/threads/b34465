5 Kelly was my hair stylist for 3 years and was not only professional and talented but took the time to get to know her clients and what they wanted from their hair appointment. Kelly was always able to give me the exact shade I wanted and was able to do my hair exactly how I wanted she was also super Helpful when wanting a huge change and she's wonderful person SHE IS AMAZING!!!
5 Kelly is down to earth and realistic. I have never walked out of her salon with a bad hair cut, color, or style. She listens to my requests, recommends styles and products that work for my hair type, and I enjoy our conversations while in the chair. I would highly recommend Kelly to anyone!
5 Kelly is awesome!  I recently met her at a wedding for a friend where she was the hairstylist for the bride and bridesmaids!  She was so sweet and knowledgeable I immediately booked her to do my hair extensions!  The extensions look awesome and best of all she was quick, efficient and very reasonably priced!  I will be traveling back to Phoenix to get my extensions done from her every time!
5 Kelly is awesome! She took the time to hear about what I wanted and did a precise job. Love it.  Thank you Kelly
