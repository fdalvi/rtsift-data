4 Soccer fields, softball fields, and a playground in a big safe area! Love it!
2 I am NOT a fan of this park.  At this point in the fall, the grass is completely dead.  It gets everywhere when you walk on it.  I am sure that the kids practicing here who fall on it are not enjoying it at all!  I am not sure why, but they are putting fences up around and through the park.  Why would you purposefully divide a park?  It makes no sense.  The only thing, and I mean ONLY thing, that I like about this park is that in putting the fencing in and making changes, they have flattened out some of the dirt lots, which make it easier for driving.  If someone asked me if they should have their sports practice times there, I would tell them that there has to be a better place out there!
1 As of today Clark County bureaucrats have raped this park, and stolen it from the people.   Just a few days ago, New Silver Bowl Park was a 150-acre open grassy field in which you and I were free to run, play frisbee, play tag football, walk your dog, play the drums, have a picnic. But the idea of a unfenced park is intolerable to bureaucrats. Today, at a cost of $1.2 million, they are installing menacing 9 foot high metal spike fencing around the entire park -- not merely chain-link fencing but the kind of fencing you would expect to find at a prison, military base, or the Berlin Wall.    At best, if you are physically challenged and can't walk long distances you'll have to hike hundreds of yards to find an opening in the fence. At worst, you'll have to use the park at a time and place when your civil masters deign to unchain one of the few openings in the fence.  None of the photos on this page reflect current reality at this park. When the fence is complete maybe I will post new ones.
