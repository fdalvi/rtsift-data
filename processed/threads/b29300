4 This Hospice of Hope is in a good area, so there are good bargains ahoy.  As with all the charity shops near Raeburn Place the stock is of good quality. There were loads of ex high street clothing brands for guys and girls, not to mention the usual array of old china, ornaments, photo frames and books.  The staff were friendly and this well kept charity shop is for a good cause, so can't complain!
5 Romanian people have come in for a bit of bad press around the UK of late, as sharp-witted critics, usually the type who watch Big Brother, complain about "Them Romanian Gypsies whit nicked ma handbag."   Without nit-picking, the light fingered foreigners they mention are actually Roma people, and rarely anything whatsoever to do with the country of Romania. It's down to this display of mass ignorance that I view this charity shop with an extra degree of sympathy and respect, and I can only hope that they've not suffered a negative impact due to the narrow minds of some poorly informed locals.   And as for the Roma, well to be honest, sometimes I admire their ingenuity. My pal's dad owns a factory and they once managed to nick every last drop of diesel from his fleet of trucks during broad daylight. Even he was sort of impressed.
