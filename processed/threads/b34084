1 This restaurant is horrible!  In particular, the service was totally lacking.  The restaurant was staffed by comatose teenagers who apparently have not been properly trained OR they just don't care.  One sandwich was wrapped in a dirty juice-splashed wrapper.  The food was tasteless and the service abysmal.....I won't be going there again!
1 Worst service and sandwich I've ever had at a Subway.  Jared wouldn't come here!
5 Nothing wrong with this Subway.  Fresh and fast!  I've been here 20 times since they've opened.  My favorite Subway.
1 2 strips of bacon on a six inch sub for a breakfast sandwich??  Also you need help that talks!  The guy that helped me this am had the personality of a slug!
