1 I wish I had not hire them. The way they cut my grapefruit tree allowed the sun to kill it. Now I have a dead tree. Not worth the money.
5 Excellent service.  Extremely polite crew, timely and reasonable.  Removed 10-15 shrubs/ bushes and trees in perpetration for updated landscaping.  Cleaned up all areas,  replaced rock to the point you would never know a plant was there.  Couldn't be happier with the job they did.
5 I don't give that many 5-stars.  I'd give this company a 6!  Very friendly, fast and as others said, they cleaned up so well I really don't think anyone was here.  Took a big sissou down in one hour (including cleanup).  Wow!
1 Well.  They did a great job removing our tree - fast, efficient, affordable, and cleaned up well.  Would recommend from that perspective.  What I am NOT happy about is that when cutting down the tree a huge limb broke off a roof tile and caused minor damage to our sprinklers main valves.  Their son, who performed the work, said they would take care of it.  I had before and after pictures and promptly emailed the owner, Allison, later that day reporting the damage and asked how it would be remedy.  No response.  Called her and spoke with her and emailed the photos again.  No response.  Emailed through "contact us" directly on their website.  No response.  Emailed again.  No response.  Funny thing is they received my ORIGINAL emails with pictures of the tree.   Long story short.  Yes, I was very happy with their work.  However, their follow up is not professional in the least and very disappointing.  So for a mere $3.50 fix for the roof tile, they are getting a bad review on Yelp.  The point is not the $3.50.  The point is that they damaged something, promised to fix it, and then completely ignored my requests to have it fixed.  Good thing I don't have any more trees to remove.
