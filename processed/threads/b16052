4 This is an EASY to get to, walk up atm. No deposits are accepted here, at the drive up stations, only withdrawl services.  There is one walk up atm on the opposite side of the building that does accept multi-deposits. i think this is the one closest to and from the strip, B of A anyway.
5 I've went to a couple other BofA's in Vegas and this is the only one I go to now. Despite almost always being fairly busy, they work through long lines quickly and the wait is never what it would be at other places. I'm drawing a blank on their names, but the 2 guys that help with more complicated transactions are very very helpful and caring. When my father came and visited and got his card stolen, they were awesome in helping him work through it quickly and efficiently.
5 Came into this branch to replace a debit card. Kevin was very helpful and had great customer service. Will come back to see him with all my banking needs for now on! Thanks Kevin!
5 Great service!! The tellers were very helpful and super nice!! The BoA in Belmont could learn a lot from this location!!
