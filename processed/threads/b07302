1 I had been coming here for years, not by choice its my boyfriends favorite place to get house fried rice. Today we decide to go pick up some of their soup. Once home I start eating the soup and find a bug in the soup. I was HORRIFIED!. But I figured hey maybe it fell in there while it was cooking. So I go to the container where the rest of the soup is and hold and behold another little critter. Looked like some sort of black maggot or something but it was just the most disgusting thing I have ever seen come from a food establishment. This is the last I will ever get food from this place again.
4 This is a place that has decent quality food. It's in a very small blink and you'll miss it place and has it own set of regulars that come. it's very small and quiet inside and there's almost no one at the counter until they hear someone come in. We come here every now and then. I love their egg rolls. I'd recommend their lunch specials. They are listed on the window and you get rice with your order as well as an eggroll in a medium size container for less than $5. Only until 3:30 PM each day. I love getting the beef and broccoli lunch special. It's much cheaper then getting the beef and broccoli  with rice later for around $8 with no egg roll :( Haha
4 I go there quiet often . Not super good but super convenient though.   This tiny place is OK.    I love the noodle.
