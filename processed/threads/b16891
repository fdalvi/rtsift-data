5 Dr Smith and the staff at Eye Care for Animals do a great job of caring for my 11 year old blind diabetic Italian Greyhound.  They are friendly and take the time to explain everything and answer all your questions.  I highly recommend they to anyone who has a pet with vision problems.
5 Excellent care. My dog was referred over by his primary doctor for cloudiness in his eye.   The clinic is very clean, there are refreshments for both critters and their chauffeurs. The receptionist was very sweet and friendly, as was the vet tech. Dr. Smith was very amiable and very affectionate to my dog. He swiftly ruled out some things we were concerned about and came to a diagnosis right away. While the combination of problems were unusual for his breed and unusual for both to occur together, he said the eye drops should clear up the problems in a few weeks with no permanent issues. Hooray!   I feel confident my animals are in good care here. Animal ophthalmologists aren't  a dime a dozen, so feel privileged that we have such good choices in our town! (And no, I don't work for these guys! Haha.)
