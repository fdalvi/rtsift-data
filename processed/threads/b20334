3 I'm not really sure if I like this place. Everything is just standard. Sofas, seats and group hugging booths ensure a relaxed and potentially cosy atmosphere and coal fire is quaint. The drinks and food are standard too, no unique ales or unusual concoctions to tempt me.  And the name? a total mystery...
3 For some reason I had such high expectations of this place - i think it might have been the really odd and unique name, but it just goes to show that you cant judge a book by its cover.  Frankly, i was dissapointed. It was just your average common or garden public house - nothing too special and not exactly offering great value for money. The staff were friendly enough and I did have an alright time in the relaxed and cozy atmosphere, but it was just a little bit of a let down that i couldnt ignore.
3 I actually wanted to give this place 2 & 1/2 stars, mainly because I can't decide whether it makes me go meh or if it's actually A-OK. The Illicit Still has always been my back-up Tollcross pub, i.e. I come here when the Brauhaus is jam-packed (which happens more often than not) and Cloisters is overflowing, and the Blue Blazer hasn't got a square foot of space to stand in. Yeah, that's kind of when I turn to the Illicit Still.   I mean, it's not all bad. There's free comedy once a week. The seats are comfy. I can't really remember my experience with the staff, but I'm sure they're decent. They have an OK range of beers and wines. I can't at all recall what kind of music they play, but they sometimes have a silenced film showing on TV with subtitles that don't quite match.   The goods are: they are possibly the only place in Edinburgh that doesn't charge you an arm, a leg and all your fingers and toes for a pint of Hoegaarden. At the Earl, a Hoegaarden is 4.50. At the Illicit Still it's under 4 pounds. Which is OK. For Hoegaarden. Also, they have an outside bit where you can enjoy a fag or hang in damp Scottish summer air. The best bit for me, though, is that they have board games. Some time ago I discovered the board game Frustration or something like that.   It's kinda fun to grab a pint over a board game. Calms the nerves. Less chance of objects getting hurled at your head.
4 When I was tired the other day, I nipped in here for a quick drink. I used to be quite insecure about drinking alone, but nowadays I relish the peace, and read a book if the settings allow for that kind of serenity.  Thus I liked the Illicit Still. Initially when I stumbled upon this place, I couldn't recognize it, although I had the vague recollection of being here before. As I contemplated why I recognized this region, I remember that not only had I been to neighbouring restaurant My Big Fat Greek Kitchen a few months back, but also my ex's sister used to stay round these parts (basically in "the pubic triangle" - lucky her).  So it was nice reflecting on a bit of nostalgia as I sipped my decent and cheaply priced pint of beer. I had spent a few good nights out in this area when I was a bit younger, and this pub seems like one of the better ones to visit in the area if my memory serves me right. I can't remember how long this palce has been around, but these days it's a fairly modern, laid back kind of place. They have an alright selection of booze on tap, it's nicely decorated inside and they do free comedy once every week.  I can see why the other reviewers can't make up their minds about how much they like The Illicit Still - it's doesn't blind you with unique booze or decor - but places like this are very necessary for a bit of downtime. That's what I acheived, and would recommend it since it's a bit more authentic than the tourist traps towards the high street!
4 Reopened as of 2007, the Illicit Still is a pub "contemporary in nature but with traditional standards", serving the busy Tollcross area.  Not as popular as the likes of Cloisters up the road, I walked past the Still many a time before actually popping in, and I always thought it looked a bit unappealing. However I've now been in on several occasions as this place has become a common place for my Kung Fu school to drop into after class on a Friday.  The Still might not offer anything fancy or unique, but its a decent and honest pub. I've always found everyone to be friendly and the staff helpful. Other than the bar, the seating can be quite intimate, with quite a lot of room, but all based around a few tables.  I used to visit Cloisters quite a lot when I lived locally but I became fed up with the sheer volume of people and knowing there was always a high chance I would never get a seat all evening. The Still doesn't have quite the same atmosphere, but it makes a perfectly adequate alternative.
