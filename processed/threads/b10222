5 This tour rocks, and it's FREE! Make sure and call ahead and book a time. The tour was quick, less then an hour with a video about the history and a look through glass windows of some of their packing rooms and freezer room. Every single staff member was inredibly nice and the ice cream is awesome!!! We went to the store that night and bought some...so good!!!
1 Yeah, the tour might be great, but the product is horrible. Bought a gallon of the full fat milk 3 days ago, it's supposed to expire 7 days from now, and it's going BAD! I've only used 2 cups! I hate when a substandard company costs me money.
4 This review is specific to the Barnyard Buddies tour.  A friend arranged for a group of us to take about a twenty kids and parents on a tour recently and it was a huge hit.  Now, they do give away free ice cream at the end so I'm sure that is the reason some people like the tour but my kids loved the main room they used for the tour that was decorated in a farm theme with large scale animated puppets.  The kids also like going through the facility and seeing the production lines.  Anderson does lots of little "extras" to make the tour cute. As an adult and a Vegas transplant I really enjoyed the historical aspect of the tour.  They facility has lots of old photographs explaining Anderson history and various locations in the Valley and then the video shown at the end goes more into the history.  The video was a little bit long for my 2 & 4 year old but not bad. The entire "tour" which included two stops in the main barnyard room and enjoying our ice cream was about 45 minutes so a good length for little kids.  We also had teens with us and they enjoyed it as well. It's free and definitely worth calling to reserve a spot!
