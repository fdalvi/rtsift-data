5 It's in a small, shady looking complex on the Southwest side of town, but its a great store.   They have trophies, plaques, & acrylics. Very cheap prices and the owners are great. It's a husband and wife that own the store - and they're very fun and personable and help you out with what you need.  Service is pretty damn quick as well. I ordered five plaques and they were done the next day. We've also ordered trophies from them as well - and they came out great. Marble bases make the trophies heavier and look nicer.   Great place to go if you need trophies and such.
5 My Fantasy Football League (FFL) decided to get a trophy last year on our annual pilgrimage to LV. On a whim, my cousin took us to this trophy store. They had a wide selection of trophies to choose from but their FFL package caught my eye. For what works out to be a couple bucks a year, you can have a bronze football on a giant wooden base; a trophy worth displaying. I reside in California, and for a moment I debated if the hassle of shipping the nameplate back and forth would be worth the cost. That's when I had the pleasure of meeting Steve, the owner, who explained how easy the process was. He was very friendly & funny.  A year later, I called the store to follow up on the engraving process for the trophy. To my disbelief, Vicki, Steve's wife, remembered exactly who we were. I think this attention to detail demonstrates the store's quality customer service. As promised, getting the engraved plates was expedient and expertly done.  If you want a trophy, and have fun picking it up, this is the place for you.
5 Awesome! I came here to get name tags for my nursing program. They offered five for $27 plus tax, which made it under $30. The woman who helped me was very nice and asked me when I wanted them ready. I said, whenever, As I wasn't in too much of a rush. She called me in an hour to let me know they were ready. GREAT service! I will go nowhere else for my name tag needs.
