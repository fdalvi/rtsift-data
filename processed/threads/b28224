4 I'm not Polish. But if I was and living in Edinburgh, Polish Mini Market would be a good pit stop if I needed any convenience food from back home.  Although it's not that big inside, it sells a wide range of Polish delicacies, Polish brands and Polish biscuits. You can pick up anything from bags of pasta to microwave meals and Polish fruit and diluting juices.  The staff are really friendly and they have a supply of Polish newspapers and magazines.  A handy newsagents for people who have moved here, but also seems to attract a number of Edinburgh locals. Why? Because it's a well priced newsagents and *whispers* Polish chocolate is AMAZING. Keep that info to yourself, you don't want their supplies to run out.
4 This place doesn't look much from the outside, but once you get in it's well stocked with a good variety of products.  It sort of doubles up as a newsagents, yet still retains its claim to being a specifically Polish shop.  It not only sells the normal British newspapers and magazine, but Polish ones too.  Further, it provides real Polish vodka and other delicacies, including pre-packaged makowiec which is a pretty tasty looking cake with poppy seeds.   The service is friendly and welcoming, and the shop, although relatively small, has a light and airy feel to it.  In my opinion, Polish Mini Market's main virtue is the balance it attains between being an accessible newsagents and a unique provider of Polish produce.
