5 I've been using Automated for a few years now and they have provided us with great solutions and service.  If your looking to automate your digital lifestyle give them a try.
5 Very good expertise! Very professional staff! Very well trained! Very diverse services! Very good customer service! Very good communication! They order, deliver, and install!  My family has used AUTOMATED ENVIRONMENTS for years. I remember their first location in a small office building. Now they moved a few buildings down to a warehouse that has impressive AUTOMATED ENVIRONMENTS! See a complete and working home theater showcase! And see them take home security to whole new AUTOMATED level, like locking your doors and setting your house alarm from anywhere with your mobile device and WiFi. It's really cool.   They have come to our home for things like repairing and upgrading our central vac system to installing our home security camera system.  For all things electronic, technical or AUTOMATED, call them first!
5 Great services for home or business A/V needs. Have used for many years. Randy, is a great tech and the company has terrific employees with minimal turnover. I've used them for project both big and small. From installing home security system to mounting an HDTV. Very reliable and knowledgeable in anything and everything A/V!
