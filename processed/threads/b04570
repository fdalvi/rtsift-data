2 This is one of our restaurants in PebbleCreek. I really love the building in which it is located and the decor of the restaurant it self. The staff is consistently friendly. But the food is just lacking. I think I have had one good sandwich in the many times I have eaten here. And dinner is no better, just blah food and real poorly cooked vegetables.  Too bad too as I want to support our own, hell I am paying HOA fees to help support these amenities.
4 So some friends came over to trim our trees, they know what they are doing better than I. As usual with friends they do not want anything for doing. But we feel they should be rewarded in some way so we took them to lunch here Toscano's. Having been so disappointed by my adventure yesterday with ordering a French dip I was still wanting a good one. So today I repeated my order here and it came out as it should, sliced thin and against the grain with a deep rich beef flavour. I was so happy I did not have to bitch once again. As usual the service here is friendly and the atmosphere and view of the driving range is nice.
1 Toscano's may be taking advantage of the apparent captive audience at Pebble Creek. My good friend & I enjoyed their patio over lunch but food was mediocre. Grilled beef, chicken & shrimp were nicely prepared but salad greens looked like supermarket to go, iceberg lettuce, salads. Yes, we do know our beefsteak tomatoes and they were not included in the salad as advertised. In truth, my girlfriend enjoyed the chicken cheese crisp and the ice coffee was quite good. Service was just above being ignored.
