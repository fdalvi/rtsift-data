5 Everyone is always welcoming and very friendly. They have a huge smoothie list to choose from. My favorite is the chocolate peanut banana, its really good and has bits of banana in it.   I also get a lemon iced tea with my smoothie.   Great place to run in to grab your smoothie in the morning if you don't have time to make breakfast, or lunch. It's very filling and satisfying.   Excellent work!
5 Great smoothies. Nice staff. Clean place. Tea is good too.
