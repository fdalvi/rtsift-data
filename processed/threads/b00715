5 Faced with the daunting task of cutting up a pile of leaves and shrub material the size of a mountain, I rented an Eleit chipper from American Equipment Rentals(AER). I had never used a chipper and was impressed with the helpful personnel at AER.They walked me through the operation of the machine and even had me bring in some of the shrub that I would be chipping,which they ran through the machine, so I could see how well it would grind it up.  The Eleit chipper is not for the faint of heart. This noisy beast(yes, wear good hearing protection) makes easy work of small branches(under 2") and dry organic matter. It made a mountain into a molehill in a matter of hours. I will rent it again.
5 I went here with my grandfather when I was a little kid so we could snake our drains. But I needed to grade my uncles front yard with over 30 tons of dirt and a few other things so I called and try said it would be around $225 for the small or medium skid steer and I got there and billy was great and talked me threw all the procedures and told us to get 2 different buckets (one for moving dirt the other for dragging the high spots down) it was very simple and there machines run great and I will continue to rent from here till they decide to close as I hope that's never and I will always give them a call when I need something for my construction business
