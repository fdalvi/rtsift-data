5 *Comfort Foot is a hidden GEM! I just needed some peace and found it here. The foot soak wasn't very long which is fine with me and my therapist started off slow so I thought, man, not another newbie, but then wham....he socked it to me. It hurt like hell but felt good at the same time. I put my earbuds in and listened to some music on my ipod and just let the foot reflexology commence. It was heaven and my guy really knew the points to hit. The best thing about this experience was how great I felt afterward! The only bad thing, if I have to give one, is it is a wee bit warm in there. If you want a cheap foot and back rub, you've found the best little secret in town! For $30, you get a bottl *e of water, a 70 mins full body massage called Happy Hour . Yep, that's a  minute rub down for less than a price of pizza at Compania!!!!  In all seriousness, if you are looking for the best way to spend a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, go to Comfort Foot.
5 It is a very  nice place. At first, my husband and I saw the ad on the local Chinese paper, and decided to give it a try. It turned out to be great! The massage was professional, and the environment was very nice. I love the background muscic as well. At the price of $30 for for 70-munites-foot-massage, it is well worthy the money!
5 Great massage for $30. I'd definitely recommend. Relaxing environment too. They don't speak much English, but don't let that stop you from getting a massage.
1 I asked for the 70 min full body massage n didnt get my legs or feet massaged. My massage lasted less than an hour and i wasnt allowed to take my jeans off.
