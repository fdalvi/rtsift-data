3 In 2005, when smoothie shops begun appearing on every street corner, I sneeringly predicted they'd all be gone by 2006. Four years later, I'm still wiping a bit of the egg off my face, but it must be said they are now slowly but surely disappearing from view, I think for a number of reasons...  1. All smoothies taste pretty much the same, regardless of content. 2. An actual piece of fruit tastes better. 3. People have realised that they were paying through the nose for what is effectively, baby food.  That pretty much sums it up.
4 I disagree with the fellow two reviewers, smoothies are here to stay.  Think about it, after a late night shouting over music and filling your body with a mammoth amount of intoxicants, the last thing you want down your throat in the morning is anything solid.  Sure it tastes the same like Gavin said, but it pretty much covers your 5 a day if you get the right combo.
3 Ever since I was given a shinny new blender, overpriced smoothies have lost their appeal. I can now make several, with just the right combinations and quantities of fruits I like, for the same price as one in Juiced Up.  Considering it's a healthy alternative to a coffee when flogging around New Town, Juiced up does offer a good variety of options. However, personally I don't like being bombarded with info about how amazing this smoothie will make me feel, as a lot of times it can just be plain old placebo. Fruit is good for you. Fact. Blend it up and down it all at once kills two birds with one stone. Fact. Make sure there is a toilet accessible afterwards at all times. Fact.
3 I came in here about a month ago when I was hungover, but thought better of it and didn't buy anything.  They offer about four or five fruits in each smoothie for about £3 as well as pure fruit juice.  The shop front and its interior are full of advertisements for healthy eating and how you can cram all your five-a-day into just one delicious cup. There are two problems with this concept as far as I can see: 1) We're actually meant to have about 8-9-a-day according to the experts. 2) In each smoothie you're practically downing a bowl of fruit in ten seconds - you're bowels are never going to like you for it.  Fair enough, Juiced Up probably sells some pretty tasty smoothies with good nutritional content.  But what's wrong with just spending half as much money and eating some fruit?
4 I first came across Juiced Up last month when a saw a woman walking down the street with the most amazing coloured smoothie and I felt completely compelled to ask her where she got it and she directed me to Juiced Up, and since then I have been a regular customer. The store is very bright and inviting on the outside promoting their smoothies.   They have a wide variation of drinks on the menu with different smoothies and juices, most of which are under £3. They make a breakfast smoothie which has blended fruits including blueberries and raspberries with muesli and yogurt. It sounds quite a strange concoction but it tasted unbelievable - definitely one of my favourites. They can also add "boosters" to your smoothie for 45p to suit your mood, such as 'energy' and 'stress relief' boosters which would be good to add to your drink if you had a lot on that day.   Juiced Up also sell wheetgrass shots for about £1 which I had the other day thinking I was being really healthy but it tasted quite disgusting so I think I shall be sticking to their more conventional juices from now on!  In addition to the drinks, they also serve sandwiches and pininis and have a small seating area indoors.
3 I'm from California and we had the smoothie craze hit about 10 years ago.  My first proper job was in a fancy smoothie/gelato/french chocolate joint and I pretty much lived off of smoothies and wheatgrass (and gelato and truffles... shhhhhh). I actually really love smoothies.  I love the kind of tastes you can put together when you are designing your own, I love how they are both filling and refreshing at the same time, I love how healthy they are, I LOVED the cute boys who worked at the smoothie joint near my high school and used to give us free smoothies.    Anyway, Juiced Up makes perfectly acceptable smoothies.  But, unless the fruit or juice is off, it's kind of impossible to screw the process up.  Their smoothies are good, if a bit too liquidy.  This place is, as Yelp calls it, A-OK.  There is nothing new or unusual about Juiced Up, it's your standard smoothie joint that also has wheatgrass, meal bars, soup and panini.    The price is what brings this place down, though I think their pricing is fairly standard for Edinburgh.  Especially considering my previous comment about the smoothies being too liquidy, that means they have a lower fruit to juice ratio and I've just paid £2.70 for OJ with a few pieces of fruit thrown in.
