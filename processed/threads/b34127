5 This place is awesome, even better than Elvira's and the service is just as good.
1 Made a stop here before heading back aboard the Stennis. Service was horrible! There wasn't even staff here to seat me! I had to come inside by myself and even cook in the kitchen by myself! By far the worst service of any restaraunt I've ever been to.
5 First time dining here and it was awesome!! If you are looking for fresh Mexican food at a good price this is your place!! The servers were helpful, friendly, and professional!! The restaurant and bathrooms were very clean!!! Great spot in AJ!!!!
4 Good food and super reasonable prices! We were a pay of five and had 2 pitchers of margaritas, a kids drink with meals and the total was $48!!
