5 When in Israel I miss Mexican foods, and in the US I miss good Israeli foods. While lamenting I searched online and found "Kosher On The Grill" and decided that I need shwarma! Yudi did not dissapoint. I got the shwarma lafa and my wife the pita. This is the meal I had been needing so badly! I felt as if I was back in shuk Levinsky but with a lot less noise. I will be returning often to this wonderful find that Vegas has been needing. The best of success to Yudi and his friends! I will spread the word too! (written by the husband)
5 New restaurant for Vegas.   Food was fresh,a lot of it and delicious.  Staff was friendly and accomendating.   Had one each of the chicken and beef tacos.  Meat was tasty and tender.  For those nonmexican lovers also has falafel, schnitzel, grilled chicken.  Will be back often.
3 Decent food and priced well. The service is a bit lacking but not due to lack of effort. The person working the counter is just not very restaurant savvy. He lacks experience. It made the ordering a bit rough but everything worked out. He is very nice but just was not so familiar with what came with each portion, etc.  You might want to consider eating here if you are then en-route to a hotel. Not straight to the airport. Might not be best to fly right after this meal. Just saying.
5 Delicious food - enjoyed the pita sharwarma !
