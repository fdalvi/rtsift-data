3 Grange Road is a handy little post office (on Grange Road) serving the busy Newington area.   This local post office provides all the predictable services you expect from a post office. I've only ever posted letters from here as well as ask for directions (which the friendly staff were very helpful with) but everything else appears to be in order.  Grange Road can get a bit busy sometimes for a post office that could maybe be a touch bigger. But given the unfortunate ever decreasing role post offices play in communities, you will never have to queue for long.
4 A local Post Office. Getting fewer on the ground. This is a place to cherish because, as we know, it's all about customer service. Here it's second to none. Friendly chat and good advice about the services you require. Sells all the usual postal paraphernalia and a good selection of gift cards. The grocery section provides everything from bread and confection to tins and toilet roll. Shop local, you know this Post Office will provide you a great service.
