5 Roses you say? This place has the most beautiful ones I've EVER seen in Madison. Every time I order from them, I'm not disappointed.Yes, I'm picky. I'm picky about what goes in the vase. No RED roses, leather leaf, babies breath, or carnations for this girl. When I called George's to place my order, they let me speak directly to a designer. The recipient of the flowers was thrilled and I was thrilled with the excellent customer service, and product. If it's Roses you want, in the most intersting, elegant, lovely, arrangement, or just by themselves, call George's. And please, no carnations, leather leaf, babies breath or RED roses. There is so much more out there if you just ask.
5 I went here to get a dozen roses for my 5 year anniversary: 7 red, 5 white. It was one of the most beautiful bunch I have ever bought. And! And, when I picked them up, the arrangements and other items in the store were equally beautiful and well put together. Go here before anywhere else in Madison. I've tried 4-5 locations and this is tops.
5 I had a bouquet of flowers sent to a very special friend that was in the hospital.  I told the lady in the shop that this was a very special friend and we needed our bouquet to say that to her.   My friend is enjoying looking at her lovely bouquet each day and her nurse told her, "I see an awful lot of flowers in my job every day and yours really take the award for the loveliest flowers I have ever seen."  The do awesome displays and they will always be my first choice for a florist.
5 I can't say enough nice things about George's.  I needed a special arrangement and got more than I ever dreamed of.  The designer listened to me and followed every lead I gave her.  If every business ran this way the world would be  better place.  Exquisite arrangment - truly a standout.  Thank you!!!!
