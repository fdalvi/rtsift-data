4 Awesomeness. I will never cut my hair and when I do cut it for split ends, I cut it myself. That said we brought my fianc√©s mother here the other day to get her hair cut. She has a hard time combing her hair so we wanted to go with a more shorter look for her. The girl patiently combed through her tangles and cut her hair very similar to the photo she picked out in their "idea" book.   Seniors get a discount so the cost was: $11 haircut+3 for a shampooing+tip. The Baseline South Phoenix location only charges $10 but they are really busy most of the time so we came here. The stylist even offered to cut her hair shorter for free if she wished to return in a few days if she was not happy with the length. Overall great place to get a quick cut or a cheapie massaging shampoo for $3. Who doesn't love cheap? You?
3 I took both my boys to get their hair cut. The lady that cut his hair seemed to be having a bad day or just hated life. Either way, she did ok and this place is cheap. Works for me. I can't really expect too much.
5 Charity has been cutting my short classic pixie cut for over three years now.  I am happy with the affordable prices.
