3 when i went to this improv i wasn't really sure what to expect, we went to the ten o'clock show and dispite there not being a big turn out of people in audence, the performers did a good job and made it entertaining. It would have been better if they sold beer there
5 I've gone to two Atlas Improv shows (both times, the 8pm Theatresports show). It's such a fun place to go with friends, family, or a date-- plenty of laughs, and a very talented group. Highly recommended!
5 Fantastic improvisational comedy. I usually go to the 8PM show on Friday or Saturday for more fast-paced improv games. The 10PM shows are great, too. They don't serve alcohol, but the restaurant next door does, and there is a connecting door, so you can bring your drink in!
