5 Great Value. My tires are old and almost worn out. One steel belt broke, so I went here to buy a used tire just to get me by for awhile (I don't drive my truck often, and thinking of selling it). I got a 31x10.5x15 truck tire for $40 (balanced and installed). The tire had a fair amount of tread on it.   Great Service. The worker dipped the inflated tire in water to check for leaks, and did a great job balancing. Another worker checked the pressure of my other 3 tires.  Cons: 1) They charge $2 for using a credit card. I guess they get a lot of cash buyers and don't want to pass credit-card fees on to them. It seems fair.  2) It's primarily spanish-speaking workers. A couple of the guys spoke English (plus the cashier lady in the small booth). The two doing the work didn't.  I liked them. Very diligent and fair.
5 If your car is worth less than $3-4k, there is no reason to put $600-700 worth of new tires on it. With that said, find a good used tire shop that is trustworthy, which is what Bob's is. For $80 I got two tires for my SUV and the owner Genaro took me back into the tire corral and let me choose the two I wanted. After driving it for 2 days I noticed it was pulling a little, and went back and this time let Genaro do his magic and he put on a different set = problem solved. This is where the trustworthy-ness really showed, didn't expect that type of service but Genaro knew what it would take to make a customer for life, and will be going back when I need to replace my rear tires. One note, a little bit of a language barrier, but if you have a problem with that you should probably should go pay $600 for tires and vote for Sheriff Joe.
5 I just can't imagine spending $750 for a set of new tires right now on my SUV when I can get them used with good tread, and at only $40 a tire, balanced and mounted! These guys were fast and the service was excellent and friendly. I recommend them highly.
5 I rolled up and even though they were busy I was attended to immediately. I was in and out in about 10 minutes, with a Goodyear tire that is in great condition and matches the wear of my other 3 tires (my vehicle is AWD so this was important). The price was beyond reasonable, and I will be recommending these friendly guys to absolutely anyone I know who needs a tire!
5 After surviving the donut tire life style for about a week while researching the best deal for 4 new tires, I decided to try a used tire for a while until my frugal self could find that deal.    These guys were very kind, friendly and were ready to work on my car as soon as I pulled in.  They gave me a great price for my tire and I was pleased with the quality.  No upselling, hidden charges etc.  It's a good honest company from what I understand and have seen.  The guy told me they get their tires from a resource in California by bulk.    Thumbs up.
5 Very professional, and honest. Nice shop, will be my regular check shop.
5 In and out in 20 minutes or less. Came in on a Sunday afternoon.
5 Awesome. I showed up 15 minutes to close. No problem. I was prepared to buy a new tire. The staff immediately told me that wouldn't be necessary because mine could probably just be fixed. 15 minutes and 12$ later,  they have a customer for life. Also checked and aired all my other tires and no labor fee.
