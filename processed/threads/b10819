5 I love the service, free samples and products here. I'm 44 with skin on the oiler side and used to use very pricey face products from England that were marine based but have switched to H2O because I think they are comparable at a FRACTION of the cost.  Sign up on line and take your coupons in and they will be super nice about honoring them. I did and I got some great deals.  They also give you freebies for "liking" them on Facebook.  Do yourself a favor and ask for Anna she is fantastic!!!
5 I love, love, love this company. I previously raved about my first experience ever in Chicago. For some reason, I have acquired two yelp accounts and cannot access the the other one. Anyway, bringing it back.   I had the best experience in Chicago. The employees were amazing and so helpful. So I was thrilled to find one in fashion show last year. Now I'm totally bummed they closed!! I walked into the store at fashion show and was immediately greeted by Amber and she gave me the same great customer service that I experienced in Chicago. She took care of my order and shipped it to me, for free mind you, to Hawaii!!! Of course I had to spend at least $100 but for the amount of products you get it is totally worth it. Can I just add that those things are heavy and Victoria's Secret never has free shipping to hawaii and their stuff is way way lighter. Brandy Melville also had crazy shipping fees to hawaii. And a lot of places don't even ship here either. So considering all theses things you can understand why I was so stoked.   She personally calls me to let me know when there's going to be a sale so I can preorder. She would also check up on me if I needed refills of anything. So when I got the call from Amber that the store was closing, the mix of emotions went from wait, 70% off everything to wait, where am I going to go now?   I have yet to visit this location but I can only expect the same great customer care and look forward to visiting soon.
