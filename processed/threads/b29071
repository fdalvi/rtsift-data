2 Well, there are only so many places to eat in Terminal 2, the oldest and smallest terminal at SKy Harbor Airport.   There are more since they remodelled it a few years ago at least.  When the young freckled red head that is "always fresh" and "always juicy" seems to be a little tired an old to you, you can opt for the Knights of the Round Table to fill your hunger. ROund Table pizza, that is.  1 combo #3         $5.75 1 slice cheese    $3.35 Total                      $9.95  I don't remember what the combo thing was. Soda and what?
1 Round table pizza is usually the bomb. In this case it is made by people who dont speak English and know nothing about making pizza.  Too much sauce, too much cheese, undercooked etc etc.    If I were the owner of this franchise I'd  get my act together cause this place blows.
4 Never been to the sky harbor location . The ones in CA are real good tho!
1 This was absolutely horrible. I got the supreme pizza with the mystery meats.  I threw it in the trash. I will wait until I get to my destination to eat. Horrible!!!
1 Airport dining options have come a long way over the past few years, sadly this Round Table Pizza is not part of that trend. After the server finished her cell phone call in the back room, I was treated to a slice of pepperoni pizza who's crust was almost indistinguishable from the paper plate it was served on. That and a domestic draft ran me about $8.50. Shoulda just gone with two brews.
