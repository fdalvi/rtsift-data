4 They sell Cirepil wax!
5 This store is always stocked with what I need and is always very cleanly. Heather, and Amy are always so helpful and friendly! They are always willing to go above and beyond to make sure their customers are always happy! I don't go to any other location!
5 Heather was so helpful. I stopped in without my license and Heather looked it up on the computer, matched the information to my DL, and off I went. This store is clean and well organized, and right on my way to work! Thankfully they are close enough to my Salon, if I had an emergency (hair dressers NEVER run out of color!) I could be there in minutes. FANTASTIC!
