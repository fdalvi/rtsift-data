3 Your regular small casino bar. Interesting people and a smaller selection of drinks. They also have one of those 1/2 yard drinks.  Found this place during our St. Patty's bar crawl of the strip. Located right between the Venetian food court and the shops with the gondola rides. Beers were cold but most of their selection is bottled. Price wasn't too bad from what I remember lol.
5 Heaven in a martini glass is a pineapple sorbet-tini at very Venice. Made with pineapple sorbet infused with alcohol (I'm guessing rum on this one), you get a big ball of pineapple sorbet (so delicious) in some rum.   They also have other flavors like watermelon and lemon, but the bartender recommended the pineapple. So glad I did, it hit the spot!  And by the way, this was my first drink of the night which means it really did taste good, it wasn't just something I chugged in a drunken casino stupor, although I did yell "OMG WHAT'S A SORBETINI?!" :)
4 I had only one martini... damn... it was SO GOOD...
2 Last time I was here everyone was so attentive but now this bartender is rude! Thanks for my beer, it tastes like it should.
5 Our bartender Liz was fantastic! She mixed me up a great Cadillac margarita and Lita a Assassino drink. Very personable and professional. We recommend this bar!!
