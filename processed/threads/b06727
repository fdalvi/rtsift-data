4 You can tell that RP's pasta is high quality...the taste is definitely superior.  We especially love their raviolis, with various fillings like the four cheese or spinach and ricotta.  I prefer to buy at the farmer's market,  where it is 2 for $10, though you can get it at different grocery stores for a bit more $.
5 Great restaurant style pasta. Delivered to your home or available at some local gluten free retailers. Nice option for a gluten free menu. Almost indistinguishable from wheat based pastas.
5 Thank You, RP's Pasta for refining and providing excellent gluten-free pasta!  I was exstatic to find your gluten-free lasagna sheets packaged for retail!  My lasagna is in the oven right now!   I choose to eat gluten-free.  i appreciate your tenacity in providing gluten-free, fresh pasta at an affordable price.   I also appreciate you for working with retailers to meet their needs!  I worked with you to source gluten-free lasagna sheets for my gluten-free customers at Hy-vee.  Your staff is always professional.  I appreciate your personal interaction.  I will always recommend your pastas, gluten-free or not because you are a company of integrity.
