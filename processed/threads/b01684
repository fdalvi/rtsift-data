5 I have been shopping at former NHL goaltender Randy Exelby's store(s) for more than 10 years now and I can't say enough good things about them. They have the best selection, best prices and best service.  The staff is knowledgeable and helpful and always willing to give you a great deal. There is no other place I would go. I wish that all retail could be this great and this cool.
5 I share Tim's sentiments about Behind the Mask.  In a hockey store starved town, BTM could really rake you over the coals for their inventory.  Yet I always come out of there paying $5-$10 less than the ticketed price.  I have even gone in there needing small replacement items, willing to pay $10-$15 for it, but somehow I never end up paying.  The manager, Brian, is a goalie like myself, and I could spend all day talking about random things, equipment, or the state of the game.  I don't even bother ordering from catalogs or websites and go directly to BTM.
5 Behind the Mask is the best hockey store in Arizona hands down. Randy and all of his guys that work their are very knowledgeable about hockey and all the new equipment. Last time I went in I needed some work done on my skates and a 20 dollar mouth guard, something that would cost about 80 bucks at the other pro shop in my area, only cost me 40 at BTM.
