1 DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.  They will take your money and your time.  We hired them to deal with weeds in front and back yard.  They sprayed front and back said they would come back to mow.  They did that.  After that is where the trouble began.  The weeds didn't die.  We called, they apologized said they would come respray.  NO SHOW.  We called again and they said someone would come out the next day NO SHOW.  We finally got a hold of Mike who at this point had a millon excuses and was very aggressive over the phone.  Talking over me.  Saying he had been by the property and it looked okay (so you were by the property but you didn't show up for the appt???)  He then said he would be by the next day.  First thing but he NO SHOWED.  Called at around 5 to say his mower broke.  Said he would come next day.  NO SHOW , this time his mower was working but he ran out of time.  Finally the next day he came, well not him but he sent someone.  hmmmm.  Mowed the lawn and trimmed back the weeds.  Didn't rake dead weeds in the rocks.  Also look at BBB, they have F rating for not responding to complaints
2 Extremely unreliable. Used this company for about six weeks. I never knew when they would show up, and quite often it was an hour before dark so they would have to come back another day to finish.   The winter lawn was a disaster. Don't know what variety seed they used, but I used more than double the water of previous years, and it barely came up. After two weeks with almost no grass sprouting, I bought a bag of seed at Home Depot and did it myself.  Other issues included blowing debris into bushes to pile up instead of raking and throwing away, simple trimming requests ignored, etc.  After not seeing Mike for THREE WEEKS and assuming he was not coming back, I gave up and hired a new service. Then out of the blue he showed up one evening and started working again. I let him know I had found someone else.
