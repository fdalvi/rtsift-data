1 Black cashier takes his sweet time and chats making a long line to purchase items. Was rude when I asked him to pick up the pace. Gave rude comments, was about to punch him in the face but was really in a hurry. I asked for his name and manager's number... didn't give the number.   I will go to corporate and complain to get his ass fired.
1 I live right across the street from the Speedee Mart.  A lot of the businesses in the plaza (and the apartments across the street) are pretty decent.  So why is it, then, that I always feel like I'm just waiting to get capped when I get gas at the Speedee Mart?    Maybe it's because I have been in this gas station right after a robbery (true).  Maybe it's because I have been accosted by thugs and told about my "thickness" in no uncertain terms ("oooh girl, you so fine...") (sadly, this is true too).  Maybe it's because the gentleman mentioned in Isa's review from 4/1 refuses to stop texting during a transaction and only makes grunting sounds when interacting with customers (I don't know if he knows any actual words).  Whatever the reason, I don't even feel safe getting out of my car at this gas station.  Tonight my fianc√© remarked, "oh, the gas truck is here refilling the pumps!  Good!  That means we might not get murdered tonight because there will be witnesses!"  And he was joking, but only a smidgin'.  There's something WRONG with this place.  Just stay away.  Seriously.   Take my word for it.
3 This convenience store is on Gibson at the 215.   It's really close and they have gas and car wash besides just corner store. But everything is just off a bit.  The car wash doesn't do as very good job and this store kinda has a grunge thing going all over.  Staff is shaky in more ways than one and again just one off  They would normally get a lower rating except I keep going here for my convenience when I am too lazy to go to a real store. Since I dont stop coming in, I cant bitch too much - its OK I guess.   Location location location matters!
1 Speed AWAY from Speedee Mart (you might get shanked if you don't).
1 As far as convenience goes, I should be buying gas and last minute essentials here on a weekly basis. I live right there and it would be the simplest stop to make. But I find myself driving out of my way to avoid this place at all costs. The people who work here seriously hate their job and hate me for pulling them away from their cigarette break to dare purchase anything. Try asking them a question and they mighty as well tell you to eff off. Give them a gift card and holy Jesus! Watch your back when you leave. It's the same two people I've dealt with almost every time. I don't understand how they are still employed here let alone anywhere else. Not to be mean but The owner obviously doesn't do drug tests. It's just a sad disgusting place.
