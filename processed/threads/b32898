5 The name is no exaggeration!  Like manna from above, this bowl filled me with light and joy.   My wife proclaimed hallelujah at the surprisingly low calorie count; a food this rich and delicious must be bad for me, but it's not!   With each bite I was reborn and left the store younger than when I entered.    Maybe it's the acai berries.  Maybe it's the guilt-free natural sweeteners of fruit and honey.  Whatever it is, it's magic served with a spoon.  Let your toxins be washed clean and try the Hawaiian bowl.
4 Great acai bowls and smoothies. If you're baking in the Arizona heat, head over to Bowl of Heaven and order an acai bowl to cool off and fill your belly.   Owners are really friendly and take great pride in making sure your food is top notch.
5 So delicious! It's a healthy alternative to frozen yogurt or sweets. So healthy it's perfect for breakfast! Tried 3 of the different acai bowls so far and they're all amazing. Cure your sweet tooth and load up on antioxidants - Win-Win.
