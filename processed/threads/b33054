5 Andrea is the best trainer!  My husband and I have been working out with her for 3 years.  She is very knowledgeable and SUPER motivating...even when I'm not so motivated!  She takes a holistic approach to nutrition, which is what I wanted, and  she varies our training routine so that it is never boring.  We do strength training, as well as functional training to keep us fit for the long-haul!  We workout in local parks, our house, the gym in our condo building, wherever is most convenient and depending on the weather.  Thanks Andrea!
5 My wife and I started training with Andrea over a year ago. Since then we have both experience noticeable improvements in our health and physique. Andrea is the perfect trainer. She really cares about you and designs workouts specific to your body type. Her personality and enthusiasm make even the toughest workouts fun. She is the best trainer I have worked with. She deserves more than 5 stars.
5 My husband and I have been working out with Andrea for about 4 years now and have not been at all disappointed. She is not only knowledgeable about training she is very knowledgeable  when it comes to advice in nutrition. My husband had been a poor sleeper for most of his life and when talking to Andrea about this she gave him some suggestions concerning his eating habits and now he is sleeping better than ever before. We received an e-mail from our Doctor that recommended some important facts about healthful eating and it is exactly what Andrea told us about a year ago. If you are looking for a trainer to improve your overall fitness she is the one. She not only will become your trainer, but you will have a very knowledgeable person you can count on for advice on your eating habits. If you look to Andrea for training you will not be disappointed and you will gain a friend Laya.
