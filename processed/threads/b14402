5 Not just good. GREAT!  They are thorough and very detailed.  We just moved to AZ from a different state.  With all of the expenses, house buying and selling and fees associated with different state tax plans Angelo and his team were a WISE INVESTMENT!
5 Have used this firm for reasonably complex tax planning and for preparation of personal returns for a decade.  I rate it as good as it gets -- speedy, accurate and personable to boot.  Reasonable rates.  Lee J.
5 My Wife used Angelo for years before I met her. We then moved to the East Coat and she talked me int giving him a try. This guy is amazing. His background with the IRS gives him great insight, and he always keeps me on the straight and narrow, but saves me so much money!!
