2 Dr Schoenrock does good work, however the appointments could be better taken care of. For example, if you don't make your next appointment while you're there, they will automatically set you up for your next one without consulting you until they try to call you to reschedule or remind you TWO DAYS prior. That's very inefficient, imho. I've been going to him for years and am finally giving up on how they run that office. They'll call you at home, when they know you have a job. They'll continue to call your home and leave messages. They just have no common sense. I refuse to go back and would NOT recommend him to anyone. They have no idea how to take care of their clients. He doesn't do a good job at cleaning, especially if your appointment is in the afternoon on a Thursday or Friday. I always felt rushed when I was there. Here's your hat, what's your hurry.  Isn't that how the saying goes?  Edited to update the inefficiency of whoever runs that office.
5 I wish I was able to give Dr. Schoenrock even more stars. He is without a doubt the best and most gentle dentist that I've ever had, not to mention a complete artist. He fixed the considerable crowding of my bottom teeth in very short amount of time and without any pain. All of his staff are just amazing, as well. Even though I now live in San Francisco I'm still seeing him here in Scottsdale. He's just that good. :)
