4 The Goose, as the locals call it is a fun place to grab some food and a drink. It is as much a landmark as Tag's is for Coolidge.   I've been here a few times to meet friends and always found the food tasty and service good.  It might not look like much from the outside, but it is really worth the stop (particularly, if Tag's parking lot looks full)!!! LOL
5 Went with a group for lunch. One of the best hamburgers I have ever had. I have been looking for a laid back place to grab some beer and food and I found heaven.
4 This is one of those small town hole-in-the-wall rustic biker bar and redneck places that are so fun to visit.  I guess they mostly serve beer, because I asked for a Margarita and the bartender said she didn't know how to make one ... LOL.  I had a hamburger and it was excellent, as were the french fries.  I also had an order of cole slaw and it was some of the best I have tried - definitely home made.  There is also a pool table and lots of seating inside and out.
