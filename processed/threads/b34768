5 When in the mood for food for my soul this is the place to go. The rice is absolutely fantastic and eaten with the shrimp makes it a satisfying meal. I definitely would recommend everyone to try this!
5 The tilapia, shrimp and rice were all amazing. Great flavor, nothing overdone. Just darn good food.
5 This place is awesome. Great food. Particularly the chicken and waffles. Everything I've had is very tasty but hard to stray from the chicken and waffles. Eat here every time I come back to Vegas.
