4 Such friendly staff and convenient, I never have to go to the post office and wait in line to ship anything. Also my packages always get to wherever I need on time.
2 They advertise they are authorized to ship FedEx but they do not ship FedEx ground. The staff is friendly.  Costly, but convenient.
5 I am never dissatisfied coming here! Living pretty far from my family, I mail a lot of cards, gifts, etc. I could take my mail/packages to the USPS office directly, but between the two, Postnet actually (somehow) gets it to my family faster. ;)
1 So I need to make two black and white copies off of a flash drive.  It's Saturday afternoon, and I walk into this PostNet.  Normally, I would go across the street to the SafeShip (on NE corner of Warm Springs and Durango), but it's a bit farther and I thought I would give PostNet a try.  What a disappointment.   First off, the staff wasn't very friendly (to myself and the customer in the front of me...but that can be typical for Las Vegas).  I get pointed to a computer to make the two copies.  A minute and a half later I am done.  Total cost....two dollars (well, $1.96).  Never mind that they advertise a copy as $.45 a page.  I ask why it's a dollar more and I am told it's because I used the computer, and they could charge me another $5 to do so.  Wow, so I guess I should be happy they only charged me $2 (instead of $7).  Yeah, but I'm not.  Makes the friendly guy at SafeShip (who only charges me like 30 or 40 cents) really awesome.  Never again to this PostNet.
5 I brought in two containers of vintage Apple computers...heavy, awkward....and homely. The nicest guy around, bagged, wrapped, boxed, taped, reinforced ..you name it. Always with a smile and kindness.  Can't go wrong here, full service and a great attitude!  You'll find this place towards the north end of Vons parking lot!
