4 For those who don't know, Edinburgh's Old Town used to have, and still has some, many old thing winding "closes" (basically alleyways) connecting main streets. These dark stone wynds have become an important part of Edinburgh's Gothic aesthetic.  One such popular close is Lady Stairs Close. Connecting the Royal Mile and the Mound, this close is named after Lady Stairs house, situated within the close, now housing by the Writer's Museum (look out for a future review). Lady Stairs has her own interesting tale of murder and marriage which if your interested I recommend you look up before your visit or wait to inevitably hear on your tour.  Many Old Town tours will take you to this Close, and if you're not planning on venturing with one, its really worth a quick peek. It shows a great example of 17th century town houses. It's also great if you like creepy old stone alleyways with a Gothic twist.   Lady Stair's Close also contains Makar's Court, a series of stones on the floor, with inscriptions from famous Scottish writers and poets.
5 Love this place. Love it.  Love the view of Princes Street, the Scots Monument, Waverley, the Balmoral and the Gardens. Love the quotations engraved on the paving stones. Love the artwork on the walls. Love the blink-and-you'll-miss-it Writer's Museum. Love the way it cuts itself off from the city in the space of a half dozen steps. Love the network of closes, and terraces that overhang and wind off it, reminding me of a hundred years ago. Reminding me of Labyrinth. Love David Bowie. Love the inspiration. Love the real taste of Oldtown.  Love it.
4 A great Mound shortcut...  Amazing views of New Town... A lack of tourists!
