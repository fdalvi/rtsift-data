5 Bought my engagement ring here. The sales woman was very polite and a true professional. She kept me within my budget and helped us find a beautiful ring. Also the application for credit was quick and discreet. I definitely would make another big purchase here.
2 I love the Helzberg Store at the San Tan mall, it seems like San Tan hires..... younger employees... I have been to this Chandler store 3 times to browse and look for wedding rings. They always seem to have a not so pleasant attitude. When your in the jewelry business you need to find a happy medium between giving your opinion and listening to what the customer wants.
1 Bought my engagement ring here and used the layaway process since we would be waiting a little while.  The whole process, and especially the customer service, was a huge headache.  We were given conflicting information from management and staff and no transaction was ever simple.  Even upon receiving the ring, when it was not resized as I was told it would be, I received attitude and blame from the manager.  As the customer of a huge, and what should be joyful, purchase, I was left feeling very upset.  I don't appreciate the manager being rude, short, and cutting me off when I have a concern.  I will not purchase from Helzberg again and regret choosing this company initially.
