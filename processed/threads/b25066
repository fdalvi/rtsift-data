4 Ive found that the only downfall of this Macys is the sales staff in the Juniors, Housewares, and Men's (designer) sections. you can never find someone when you need them and theyre a bit curt.  Otherwise, this location is laid out like most of the other locations (besides Fashion Square). Items are easy to find and get to. There are also price checks all over the place for those "how much is this really" sale items. I do have to say that the staff at the jewelry counters at this location are some of the nicest, most personable, and helpful people Ive ever encountered (get it? counter?).  Remember that this location has 3 floors: customer service, housewares, kids clothes, and furniture are all on top!
1 This Macy's is terrible.  This may sound ridiculous but it's worth driving across town to go to the one is Scottsdale.  The selection here is horrible, the staff are unhelpful and everything always seems to be out of stock.
1 This store is horrible. Waited 20 mins in line for a return and had my receipt,  they gave me the lowest dollar amount available and we're extremely rude to me. Will not shop at Macy's anymore. Dillard's is 100x's better!!
