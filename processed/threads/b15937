4 This is the BCBG inside the Venetian shops.    It's large and has an enormous sale selection, as well as the usual new offerings but what was really intriguing to me was that they had two racks of runway items when I was there.  I didn't see anything I couldn't live without but I thought that was pretty interesting, especially since all the items were more edgy and artistic.  Fun to browse if nothing else.     Customer service was great, as well.
5 I purchased a shirt here a couple of days ago when I was in Vegas. Love this store. So many nice things. One of the best shirts I've ever gotten. So comfortable and looks wonderful. I loved the service here, exceptional. Great selections of dresses and many other things. The sale rack was great, cause most of the other things I couldn't afford. Quite the high prices.
