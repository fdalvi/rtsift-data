4 The cocktails were 1 of a kind but pricey. Good thing for Travelzoo!!! Our mixologist was superb and he played GREAT music. The lighting and decor were amazing. I was happy to spend time there 2 nights in a row
5 Wow - fantastic!  We were disappointed the first night when we walked in at 10:45 and were told they were out of ice and had just had last call.  The second night a different bartender (Eddie) was very welcoming.    A friend and I enjoyed the Foreplay (shot for 2) - a decadent mix, the only thing I remember being Bailey's caramel cream, served in an edible chocolate cup.  Arguably the best deal on the menu.  When I couldn't find anything else I was eager to try, Eddie asked some questions and came up with a drink that included mango chile-infused vodka (hot, hot, hot!) and muddled strawberries and raspberries.  I can't remember what else he added, but it was awesome.  Be warned, this small bar has only 6 seats, and even standing probably can't handle more than 8-10.  It's awesome, cool and definitely a must if you're in the Palms Casino!
4 While it's not a "speakeasy" with a secret entrance and a convoluted process for gaining entry, Palms' Scarlet Bar does a fair approximation of capturing that hidden gem vibe.  Scarlet is an intimate 6-seat bar dedicated to craft cocktails and unique infusions set just off the casino floor and tucked away in the corner next to the Ivory Tower elevators.  Decked out all in red (or scarlet, if you will) and lit with red accented lighting and candles, the bar evokes a sexy, if not a bit gothic, feel.  However, Scarlet's draw for the fiancée and me was what it did with its spirits and not its décor.    I started off with the Rock & Rye ($16) made with Bulleit Rye infused with rock candy, roasted pecans and oranges and served over an ice sphere.  Boozy with subtle notes from the infused ingredients; it was delicious!  For my next go-around, I had the Scarlet G&T ($16) made with Bombay Sapphire East infused with star anise, cardamom, and citrus peels, and Fever Tree tonic.  The infused spices really fit like a glove with the botanicals already found in the gin giving it aromatics reminiscent of Southeast Asian cuisine.  I could imagine drinking it with a nice hot, steamy bowl of pho.    Hands down, Scarlet Bar does high quality craft cocktails exceedingly well.  While it's pricier than many of its craft cocktail peers in Las Vegas, I attribute much of that to the cost in money, time, and effort to execute its infusions.  I'll spend a little bit more for a well-made drink.  Scarlet Bar made a well-made drink.  4.25 stars.
5 I love interesting and well crafted cocktails that you can sit, enjoy and savor. This place did just that for me. The mixologist that was there (sorry didn't catch his name) was awesome. He answered all of our questions and gave his opinions on what might taste good. He made me this AWESOMELY DELICIOUS drink with the banana bread infusion that I highly recommend if you love banana flavors. It tasted like a banana chocolate covered strawberry. GET IT! It is no joke delicious. My bf got a drink made from the mango Chile (i think it was) that was also delicious. We are however, adventurous when trying things. The spice might not be for everyone. The setting was very intimate, with a touch of a Gothic feel. It makes for a great date night too. It was very small in there but you can take your drinks and walk around or go sit at the center bar.
4 Great little Bar! The key word here being "little". Six stools... that's it, but it really lends itself to the idea of Craft Cocktails. it also free's up the Bartender to provide outstanding personal service. One of the two nights we stopped in, we were the only two in the bar. Instead of feeling awkward, It felt like Eric was our own personal bartender. My favorite drink was the Rock 'N Rye.  Rock Candy and Roasted Pecan infused Bulleit Rye with a Dehydrated Orange Wheel served over an ice sphere. The coolest thing about this drink was how the flavor changed as the ice melted and the Orange re-hydrated.  Wheelchair access to Scarlet is convoluted, to say the least. Open an almost unnoticeable door in the hallway that leads to the Palms Pool. Go up a short, dimly lit ramp, through a door that actually enters the restaurant N9NE, exit through N9NE's front door, onto a landing above a staircase, turn left, enter Scarlet. Whew!!! You know I liked the drinks if I was willing to deal with that twice in 4 nights!
5 We had such a good time here. I got the pop rock shots and my husband had an espresso drink, and then switched to straight vodka. The atmosphere is so pretty. We actually went two nights, and the bar tender not only remembered us but remembered it was my birthday vacation. His name was Eddy and he was probably one of the nicest bartenders we have ever come accross. I can't wait to come back. Glad we came.
2 I was excited to try this place, and it has so much potential. I found it on a yelp search, I was looking for bars that serve Fever Tree Tonic. I don't frequent the Palms, so I figured a cocktail before depeche mode would be the perfect time.   This place is tucked in a corner near N9NE. It's really sexy inside, intimate, red lighting and a large red candelabra centerpiece. Only 4 stools at the bar.   I ordered a Gin & Tonic with Bombay Sapphire East. I watched him make it, it was one part gin and ten parts tonic. For $14 (plus a $3 tip) I basically paid for a bottle of tonic. Bummer. I really wanted to like this place, so I decided to give them another try after the concert, I chose the infused vodka flight. Mango Chile was really good, but the other two, Ginger, Cherry, Strawberry and Peppar Blanco were terrible. I couldn't get them down. Eddie, the bartender, asked me what I thought, I told him I liked Mango Chile, but the other two I couldn't drink.  A decent bartender would've offered to change out the two I didn't like. Sorry, I don't mind paying for a good hand crafted cocktail, but I didn't find that here.
5 This is a TINY bar, but my two friends and I had so much fun here (it helped that the drinks were so good that we kept on ordering more).  The bar probably seats 6-7 at most, but that means that if you have one of the few seats at the bar, it's easy to get the bartender's attention.  We were served immediately.  I started off with a drink off the menu, which was decent but nothing fantastic.  What was fantastic was when my friend asked for a fruity drink and the bartender made her a Passion Fruit Mojito.  It was so delicious that she ordered myself and her husband one...then a second one...and maybe a third for each of us.   He told us he mixed the fruit concoctions there, so it will be hard for me to find again!  The bartender also gave us a shot with house-infused vodka, which was also tasty (and spicy).   Overall I loved this bar and if I find myself staying at the Palms again, I will definitely re-visit this place.
5 This is one of my favorite bars. The infusions are hand made on premises and the main bartender, Daniel is ridiculously good at what he does. When you're in the bar, it is so small and intimate that after your first drink you keep ordering more as you don't want to leave. After a few drinks I couldn't decide what I wanted to order next and Daniel made me one of his own concoctions which was a strawberry mint drink with some spice. Holy crap, it was so tasty.   I would recommend this bar to anyone who wants a nice bar experience in Vegas, but who doesn't want to put up with the huge bar crowds and expensive, watered down standard cocktails. Live a little.
5 The Scarlet Bar was the high point of my recent stay at the Palms. A tiny little bar(about 6 stools) tucked off in the corner of the casino near N9NE Steakhouse that offer hand crafted and hand muddled cocktails made by a mixoligist. We happened upon Scarlet on a Thursday afternoon by mistake and by the time we checked out on Monday morning three of us had probably consumed 40 drinks from Scarlet.  These drinks are so good that even though we were gambling(alot) and could have got free drinks all day but we would keep walking over to Scarlet to pay full price for their cocktails.   They have a good specialty cocktail menu but they will create anything you want, I suggest having them whip up something special for you based on your tastes. Our favorite was something made with Pimm's, hand muddled strawberries and cucumbers, very refreshing.   Drinks are not cheap, about $14-$16 a piece but worth every penny in my opinion.
5 I can't say enough about this little gem. It's SO easy to miss walking through the hotel, but my friend and I bought a four for the price of two drink special so we thought we would just stop in for a little while prior to going to Ghostbar. We ended up staying here for a WHILE. There are only six or so chairs so we got there early to claim our spot. The drinks were fancy and a little overwhelming so we asked for recommendations from the fantastic bartender Daniel and he made us some AWESOME drinks. We even came back to Scarlet AFTER going to Ghostbar! Just a great place with excellent service.
3 One of the smallest bars that ever was, Scarlet Bar is worth checking out if you are in the Palms and looking for a craft cocktail in a sexy red dress...I'm just not sure I would go out of my way to end up here.  3.5 Stars for drinks, crimson concept, and vermilion appeal...a little less for the size and place.  Scarlet bar is the cardinal guy that talks a little too often about how it's not the size of the ship, but rather, the motion of the blood-red ocean that matters.  SB is tiny small and their drinks don't rock my rusty boat quite enough to make up for it.  They are however leaning towards the more elevated craft cocktail style that is vastly superior to what the ordinary bars in the Palms are spitting out.  They have a couple of inventive/playful shot combinations for couples looking to play around with sanguine, rose, cinnamon, or cherry drink options.  These are more about the idea of doing something clever with a significant other than anything else and I can certainly curtail my snobbish drinking tendencies enough to embrace this.    There are certainly better options around town though--even N9NE right next door has the ability with their wider variety of bottles to put out better drinks, but SB is a room as red as the female cochineal, that invites you in for an experience.  For the record I was told recently that it may take a while to get from New York to London in a large vessel, but it takes even longer in a rowboat.
3 YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(144/365) "Seeing Red..I Mean Scarlet"  Checked out this little spot next to N9ne at the Palms a while back. Little is right! I think 6-8 people in here is the maximum capacity. Any more than that would be a tad too many.  Now when it comes to mixed drinks/craft cocktails, you're speaking a foreign language to me(I lean more towards beer and wine) Don't remember what we got, but it was some kind of  shot infusion with pop rocks which was kinda fun and interesting. After chatting with the bartender for some time, he realized that we were locals and was kind enough to get a pass for us to check out both Ghostbar and Moon.  There are a lot of other options around town, but if you want a little privacy away from the norm with your date or significant other, This little cozy spot might do it for you. ALOHA!!!
