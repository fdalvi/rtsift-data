3 seconds away from my home, it's easy, fast, and convenient.   i did have an issue or two with different gas pumps not wanting to take my card, but it's not hard to pull up to the next one.   the area is kind of sketchy and i don't feel comfortable stopping there unless it's during the day. this is where the 3 stars come into play.
5 I work across the street from this gas station, and my "gas station buddies" as I like to call them, and myself, go to this gas station every single day.  The people that work here know us well, and we joke and laugh together.  They are super helpful.  Whenever our favorite soda is out, there are more than willing to run to the back and change it.  There is also a wide selection of snacks and other drinks in the refrigerated section.  They keep the store clean, and clutter free.  All in all, if you are looking for a quick place to pick up snacks for the movies, or a quick drink for work, run over to this location.  They are always willing to help!
4 This location is conveniently located in the same parking lot as Michael's.  I can stop and get a drink and snack or gas then go do the shopping I want within the center. The store is clean and the staff is very friendly.
2 Typical Herbst. Dirty and poorly stocked, but needed some gasoline....
3 Typical gas station in Vegas gas attendant rude. Dirty, grimy and filled with desert rats.
