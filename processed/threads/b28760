4 The Edge Festival has, since 2008, taken over from T on the Fringe and has cemented itself as Edinburgh's number one music festival! I loved T on the Fringe where I saw one of the best gigs I have ever seen in my life - The Raconteurs at the Corn Exchange!   Across August, bands and solo artists play at a number of small and larger venues in Edinburgh. Normally gigs are played at the Corn Exchange, the HMV Picturehouse, the Liquid Room, Cabaret Voltaire and the Queens Hall, but there are other much more intimate venues.   Edinburgh is absolutely buzzing in August with the festival season, and the Edge Festival manages to add to the already brilliant festival scene. The festival manages to fill the line up with major chart topping acts, with indie bands and new upcoming bands.   A brilliant music festival, however it is sadly probably overlooked currently due to the fact that it does not have the same name recognition as T on the Fringe. But who cares about the name!   Good gigs, good venues....good experience! Give it a shot!
4 I only found out about this festival through my work with Fest Mag. Which makes sense since I've only spent two festivals here and wasn't here at all last year. The year before that I was working too much outside the festival to keep track of everything that was going on, but this year I plan to attend it as much as I can.   The Edge Festival has a combination of big bands such as the Phantom Band, Phoenix and Eels playing this year, as well as many bands I've never heard of, but am looking forward to seeing live. Their gigs will also be held at a variety of venues, from the Wee Red Bar, to Cabaret Voltaire, and the HMV Picturehouse. Prices range all the way to 20 pounds, which considering the Edinburgh International Festival is not too bad.
