1 I came here when I first moved to Vegas needing a quick haircut. You get what you paid for is the lesson I learned. Service sucked the entire time. The hairdresser had this glub attitude about him. Avoid at all costs.
5 I have to vouch for this location because I get consistently good haircuts at a reasonable price. I'm a guy so it might differ for girls who want more complicated things done but they've never failed me and my only regret is that these women aren't available in LA where I go to school.  I recommend Tilly or ... this other lady (not the old one). When I remember her name I will edit this review.  Either way, try this place. It's fairly cheap and the ladies are nice. Just avoid the old one because I don't think she understands English and she butchered my brother's hair and had him walking out looking like MC Hammer. I had a good laugh though.
5 This is the only place I go to get my hair cut and not because it's cheap. Tilly is my stylist and I am never disappointed whenever I go to see her. She is friendly, makes me laugh and does an excellent job.
1 Great place for bald guys to go. Horrible location, employees can barely speak English, and they have no talent to cut hair at all. Going to be wearing this horror show around for quite a few weeks.
