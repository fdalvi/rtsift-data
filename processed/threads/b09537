4 Overall a nice store.  Clean, a good variety of products, and good meats and produce.
1 Second time in 6 months that I have had problems with meat department. First time was bad shrimp. Last Saturday I bought chicken that was super rotten. I smelled something in the car on the way home and when I got it into the house and opened the package I about fell over.   FAIL ALBERTSONS...
5 This is my favorite grocery store. The produce and meat are always fresh. The staff is super friendly. I much rather shop here than Walmart.
4 Really like this store, feel comfortable coming here.  Most of time they have enough cashiers which is rare these days, very friendly service.  I like their chicken wing spread.  Prices aren't as competitive as other companies but I'll trade that for a good experience.  It's also easy to find stuff in this store.
5 They don't have the best of everything but the meat quality is far superior to most supermarkets in the valley.  Another thing I like is that there is no club card which I find irritating. The guys in the meat department are very knowledgeable and the service is sufficient.
