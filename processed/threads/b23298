5 This review is based on my experience at Elements with Andy.  I had tried 2 other massage therapists there before someone recommended him to me.  They were ok, but Andy is the BEST.    I have had chronic back and neck pain for 15 years now, and have had many, many massages.  Andy is one of the best massage therapists I've encountered.  He is freakin' amazing...you just have to go see him and experience him.  I can't put into words how good he is. :o)
5 I'm on board with Julienne.  My 91 year-old Dad is a steady client of Andy and raves about him as well!  We have gone to this location 2-3 times a month for close to a year now.  Elements is a very consistent operation with very reasonable pricing.  The package deals are the way to go if you can swing them.  This location is very nice, clean and professional with friendly staff.  I've experienced several of the therapists and they are all first-rate.  I see Teresa because she has strong hands, a practiced technique, and a knack for finding the pressure points that need work the most.  I highly recommend this location if you are in far north Scottsdale!
5 Excellent service by Michele. First time coming to a massage parlor outside a spa. Price is very reasonable, ambiance really nice. Will definitely be coming back and sending the husband.
