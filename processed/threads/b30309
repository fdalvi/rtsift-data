5 I would definitely recommend Hector's automotive to my friends. So friendly and professional, without being overpriced. After bringing my car home from their shop, I noticed something unusual. They were so nice over the phone and even sent a mechanic to my house to check it out. Now that's customer service!!
5 I had taken my car to Terrible's to have an oil change and their bill stated that everything in my car was leaking.  My oil, transmission and also my power steering.  I had no leaks in my garage.  I took my car to Hector's and they told me that I had no leaks, but that all of the areas were loose and that they tightened them. That I had NO LEAKS!    I've put in a bad review for Terrible's and would suggest that NO ONE use them.   The  mechanic at Terrible's was mad because I would not be sold the "full service" when all I wanted was a simple oil change.  He lied thru his teeth about my car leaking.    Hector's is a very honest shop, they pay attention to your needs and try to assist you in any way that they can.  The best part is that their HONEST.  Not something you find here in Las Vegas for a Mechanic Shop.  I wold recommend them to anyone that needs work done on their cars.
5 Love these guys.  They have worked on all my cars.  Lexus, Porsche, Chevy Pick Up and they do a great job.
