5 I have searched for a good barber for years, I just found Omar. Best flat top in the Phoenix metro area.
2 Female was rough in my son after I said he was tender headed. Cut ok but I've seen better.
5 This is our go to place. I haven't found another barber shop that can cut my sons hair the way I like. Sometimes we get certain ppl and they don't do as good as job as the owner or others, but all in all, they do a spectacular Job compared to most barbers we've been to. The owner is really nice too, makes you feel welcomed.
1 Stopped by to get a hair cut, so close to the home I just bought thought this would be the barber shop I would start coming to. Lady that cut my hair jacked it up. Was supposed to be a fade, wasn't faded at all being uneven on both sides of my head. Never going again, ever...  Rather drive 30 minutes to downtown at least they will do a decent job.
