1 two years ago for Christmas I bought myself an iphone here. I was sooo excited about it. everything was fine until a month later when I realized I was charged for 9 more iphones!!!!! I had 6 over-draft fees plus the cost of the phones I called the store the guy I was talking to got nervous and said its not possible...I talked to the store manager he said he looked up the transaction and saw that there was a card swiped, he was sure about it and said call VISA and talked to them this has nothing to do with us someone stole your card or made a copy of it (I never lost my card) i called my bank they said the card was entered in 3 times. I realized that the manager lied to me. I did get my money back and I called AT&T told them about it....they didn't seem to care that much about it...I guess they made the sale they didnt care how. all that said I still love my phone and I am happy with my AT&T service, but I do recommend ppl not to do business with this store. there is another one on the same street a couple of blocks up
2 This att is always clean but the employees are Not that knowledgeable, and will make up anythinh as they go.
1 Never have I been more disappointed with this store. I've been coming here for 6 years and I'm done. They lack knowledge in the phones and lack care and understanding. Totally unwilling to help. They show no sympathy for their loyal customers. My advice is to stay far away from this store.
5 I'm not sure why this location got a low review, but I had a very pleasurable experience. I was there yesterday. Hessie was particularly helpful as was his female co-worker, who's name I didn't get. They put the screen protector on, recommended a nice Jabra hands free set, and paired the device with my phone.
