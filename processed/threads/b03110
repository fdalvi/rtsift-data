3 I haven't been a regular customer of Big Lots since, well, ever.  I had a few minutes to kill in this neighborhood recently and decided to have a look around this Big Lots.  It's a pretty big store with a pretty motley assortment of odds and ends.  I did pick up a few things here and they were a good deal.  I'd say about 15-20% of what they have is a good deal, the rest is average prices, poor quality or both.  I guess that's what you get when you buy big lots of odds and ends.
5 god i love mcfrugals.  why did they change their name? mcfrugals is way better.  it's hit or miss for sure, on items and prices. but holy moly! this store is HUGE. they have a ton of items seen at target for a bit cheaper.  i always like to check out their christmas decor. yesterday i scored a pre-lit garland for $6.   I also picked up a few jones sodas for $.70.   they have furniture which was weird/cool. nothing fancy or very attractive...but if you're desperate it's probably a pretty decent deal.   a few things i thought were cool: movie theater popcorn maker chocolate fountain jewelry armoires the candle and candle accessorie section (the best part in my opinion) name brand digital cameras $6 movies   I never really find anything I need but it has odds and ends and i don't ever spend more than $10 on an item. I didn't get to poke around much because the store was huge and I was on my way to somewhere else, but this store was awesome!
3 I like to check out the after holiday deals. Sometimes you find a winner. pricing isn't any better than the other guys
