4 Came here for some Ice Cream on Saturday night.  Location is in a strip mall at the very end.  Location is open late, with a great selection of ice cream.  Staff was fun and friendly, and I will gladly return!
5 I love love love Baskin- Robins. Again another place i grew up eating ice cream at ever since in Elementary school so definitely over 15 years.  I love their two scoop ice cream sundaes with whip cream, hot fudge, almonds and cherry.  I typically always chose chocolate chip.  They make it super fast.  So if you ever want just regular ice cream and not yogurt i would go here.  I've also purchased ice cream cakes for birthdays and they are sooo good.
5 On a sunny, winter day, there's nothing like a scoop of Baskin-Robbins ice cream. Seriously so many flavors to choose from. Now they even have frozen/soft-serve yogurt.  Two of my favorite flavors are World Class Chocolate (which I'll buy a pint or quart to go) and Mint Chocolate Chip.  I wish they had more flavors in their pre-packaged section.  The shop is clean and the workers here are pleasant.
4 The staff here are always cheerful and friendly, and while the items here are a bit pricey ($6 for a large smoothie or milkshake) you get your money's worth.
3 It's Baskin Robbins ice cream, what more could you ask for!    I would have given it five stars; but, I had my 4 year old with me and she had to use the bathroom and they wouldn't let her (employees only).  We had to go over to the Goodwill store.  For those of you with a toddler or a preschooler, you KNOW what a HUGE inconvenience that was.
2 Ice cream is always really good I like the low fat options that's why I have it to stars. The customer service is always horrible and they do not have a restroom for children!! It's basically like they want you to go in get ice cream and leave right away! They should be more kid friendly
5 What can you love about an Ice Cream shop? A lot I say. This BR has a lot to love. It is nice and clean, there is a lot of parking in the lot. The staff is friendly and the Ice Cream is divine! Lots of flavors, lots of choices. It is an old favorite that just keeps going. Thank you for still being around after all these years.
4 Went here on a Tuesday night and it was pretty busy! Only downside is that they got rid of their outdoor seating.. Which left us to sit inside of the freezing icebox that is the seating area. Our ice cream was delicious though! I will be back very soon!!! The ice cream cakes are delicious and my go to for birthdays!
4 We got there in the knick of time on a Tuesday night. The location could use a major facelift, but it's friendly, prompt and has the nice student working the counter. And it's ice cream. 31 Flavors and all.
