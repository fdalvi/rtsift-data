1 Lowes locally reps this line.  They lack local installers, at least when I wrote this, so lead times for quotes took forever.  And when they finally sent me a bid, weeks longer than it should have, their pricing wasn't competitive, nor worth the wait and hassle. I paid $35 for a hassle and worthless quote.
3 Went here for parts. They did have what I needed, and customer service is ok.
5 I have been dealing with Arizona Shower Door for over 15 yrs and have never been disappointed. There customer service is unmatched and they offer all of the latest designs. From a simple Sliding Door to the most custom Frameless Door...they have it all. We have several options when it comes to glass suppliers...but AZ Shower Door has more than earned our loyalty. Their Showroom is a must see if you are planning a Bathroom Remodeling project.  Jesse Bathroom Transformations
