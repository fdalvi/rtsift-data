5 I got the white screen of death of my iPhone, which the Apple Store said they could fix for $200, which I figured was a little too high for the LCD which you can purchase for $40-60 online.  So tucked away in Lynh Alterations next door to Metro phones is Vegas iPhone Repair.  It was hard to find, I asked at the Metro phone shop and the guy said he had never heard of an iPhone repair place but for $399 I could walk out the door with something better (a comment 2 other people said they were told as well once I was there)    The repair took 5 minutes and cost $60, I could not be happier
1 make sure you watch him while he repairs your phone. We have heard that sometimes, tech will take your original parts and replace it with copy parts.  we left it for him to fix and unlock. Took it home and it still didnt work. We called and  told the tech the issue, the phone is locked and we cant do anything with it at all. were advised to bring back to Apple to have them restore all, but before we bring back to Apple, we have to bring the phone back b/c there was a part that he forgot to put back. ( light went on in my head- out of all those phones and parts he has lying aroud on his desk, how does he knows which one he left out of who's phone- hmmm)  And months later I heard from a guy selling Iphones said that actually many of these places do that. I have only one experience with this shop. I do like the prices, so just be aware and watch him fix your phone.
1 I agree with Kristine F.  The lady who answered the phone is rude.  Unprofessional place...yelling questions to a coworker on the phone, cuts me off.  I ended up hanging up the phone...it's a sign of disaster.
