5 Great service. Very friendly & always on time. I wouldn't call anyone else.
1 Identified myself as a first time customer with a coupon they left at my office and instead of sending me the car they advertised, they called a cab from another cab company who drove a dumpy Crown Victoria. Never gave me advanced warning of the switcheroo and the substitute cab didn't even honor Euro Way's coupon. Way to impress. It's nearly imposssible to get a live person on the phone and they don't return messages. Left a message the morning of my ride to the airport complaining of my less than positive experience and still nobody bothers to call me back.
1 Don't count on this service - I recall them being pretty good 3-4 ago but things have changed.  They are difficult to get a hold of them and the rates quoted on their website aren't guaranteed even with a confirmed reservation.  Although their automated phone message says all calls are answered within 5 rings, the pickups are generally voice mail I've had much difficulty over the past few years in getting responses back.  Even online reservations are not responded to in a timely manner, leaving you hanging for a few days to even know if you've got an acknowledged reservation.  I just had a trip with them and I called to 2 days after making the reservation to confirm - quoted rate was $41 + $5 surcharge.  My flight arrival was delayed an hour but I was contacted upon arrival and notified that cars were ready to pick me up after I had retrieved my luggage.  When I arrived home, the charge was $81 before tip.  I contacted customer service today and was told they had to contract my trip out to another service which has different prices.  Euro Way's inability to fulfill a confirmed reservation shouldn't be the customer's problem - it's should be a business decision on their part.  They should either eat the difference or not confirm a reservation if they can't fulfill.  Find someone more reliable.
