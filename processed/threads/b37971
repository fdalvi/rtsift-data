5 Wow!  Incredible team of staff and doctors at this place.  Loved that they got me in on the same day I called.  It was great being able to see my doctor and then get right in for a chiropractic visit immediately after to work on my shoulder.  I actually felt better within minutes of my appointment being over.  Amazing team, amazing appointment.  I will definitely be going back.
3 I really liked the FNP I saw, but the Medical Assistant completely rubbed me the wrong way and tested my patience. We'll see if things improve--I have to return next week for follow-up.
