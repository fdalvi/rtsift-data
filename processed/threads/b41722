5 So very excited to have Oil and Vine at the District....Great selection of some amazing oils, spices, vinegars and soooo much more......if you love to cook and LOVE flavor, this is the place to go
5 Oil and Vine is AMAZING!!!  My best friend and I had a blast sampling all of the vinegar and oil flavors.  Absolutely delicious and decadent.  I bought quite a few of the flavors because I just couldn't decide on one.  The owner was super friendly and helpful.  It is a great store and you will LOVE the experience!
5 Really great flavored oils and vinegars, along with a thoughtful selection of complimentary foods and wine.  The store is set up for customers to taste the oils and vinegars and some of the spice rubs, sea salts, tapenades, chocolates, etc.  Great pastas including traditional, gluten-free and low carb.  They produce some great gift baskets and will do custom baskets as well.  Located in the District at Green Valley Ranch.
