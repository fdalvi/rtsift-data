5 I went to this salon for the first time just this week. The salon is clean and each salon is easy to locate. I saw Andrea Croci(who has been coloring my hair for four years) and Casey Fox(who has been cutting my hair for almost a year now). The atmosphere of the salon was very calm and relaxed which is a major change from what I'm used to over the years. I love my color and my cut and I will be going back.
5 Awesome highlights by Andrea and hair cut by Casey today. So glad I located them again. Very nice and relaxing Salon
5 So I'm back on yelp just to write this review. I was referred over to Andrea by my brother in law who had worked with her at Toni & Guy in the past. She was super cool and listened to what I wanted. She did an excellent job, even meeting my high expectations. I'm in love with my color and I'm so hard to please! Found my new color girl. Thanks Andrea!
