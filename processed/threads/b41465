5 This place is a gem! Was looking to get my BMW M6 lowered with H&R springs & get a front lip installed, was getting ridiculous quotes from other shops, I was recommended to call Jason at Parts Score, they got me in rite Way, charged me half what other shops were quoting & did an excellent job.  What impressed me with this place is the attention to detail they pay..Jason the owner takes great pride in his work.  These guys also do service on cars, I will be bringing my BMW here for all my service.   Thanks for the great service & reasonable prices.
5 Awesome people, beautifully organized shop and very reasonable prices for good quality work. Can't say enough good things about Jason, who is extremely organized and meticulous. If you, like me- are particular and methodical, this is the place to come to for your car.
5 What can I say.. Parts Score has earned my trust 1000%. Jason is an extremely detail oriented person. His followup and documentation is unreal. His shop and work area is spotless and his work speaks for itself. Leah the shop manager follows up to provide updates and even emails you pictures of the progress! They snapped some teasers of my car before I was able to pick it up! Very cool and personable touch!  Thus far he PartsScore has done performance mods for me: suspension (H&R coilovers), APR stage I/II, and some custom exhaust fabrication when aftermarket parts were not readily available . Also check with him before you order and European parts, he could of gotten me a better deal on some of my hardware.   He will also be taking over the general maintenance for my car as he cannot be beat in terms of service cost compared to the dealer plus its always awesome to see what else they are working on back there. I have seen some wicked BMW M's and even Audi R8's getting full performance treatments.   I recently learned they accept warranties too. Knock on wood I don't need it but if I do, Jason and the team at Part Score will definitely hear from me. Thanks for taking care of not only me but also my VW CC.   You guys are the best!
5 PartsScore built my fully custom Volkswagen Cabrio show car from the ground up.  Jason and Leah are a great team with such creative minds and are totally customer oriented.  Their pricing is very reasonable, the quality of work is truly exceptional, and the attention to the small details just isn't found elsewhere, especially in this type of business.  From basic maintenance to full customization of parts, PartsScore seems to do it all, in reasonable time and at reasonable prices.  Rarely do you run across small businesses that actually enjoy their work. PS definitely loves their work and the cleanliness and organization of their shop shows that.  I 1,000000% recommend them for your European car service needs or performance part installation.
