4 Meandering around the Mill Avenue District it's not surprising to find this catch-all type of store that caters to the local ASU student body.  Here you can find all sorts of chatskas - shot glasses, snacks and soft drinks, t-shirts and hoodies with the ASU emblem, change purses, etc.   Definitely not a boutique - but a functional place to get stuff.
4 My best friend collects college sweatshirts and has been begging me for an ASU one. As I was walking down Mill Avenue to get to the lightrail today I saw this place and wandered inside. It not only sells ASU clothes, there is also food, drinks, cigarettes, and pretty much anything else you could need as a college student. I found the perfect sweatshirt for my friend, for the fraction of the price you would pay at the bookstore and elsewhere, and thus left a happy camper.
4 A mix between a convenience store with everything you could possibly need and a retail shop stocked with ASU gear. I met the owner, Mike Jennings and he says he tries his best to keep the prices low. Great tactic for repeat customers. They have drinks and snacks if  you're in a hurry. I like the selection of ASU gifts and apparel. They've got it all!
