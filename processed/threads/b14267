5 Dr. Patrick is an exceptional dentist. He is a perfectionist and genuinely cares for his patients. My husband and I experienced this first hand. Having had 2 new crowns recently (which can be very expensive), we found Desert Oasis pricing to be very competitive.  Dr. Patrick always has a positive attitude and makes you feel comfortable. It is SO worthwhile to go to a dentist you can trust. Additionally, the office is beautiful and the staff is always pleasant and professional.
5 Dr.Patrick has a very gentleness about him that makes it easy to relax. I highly recommend him highly.
5 Dr. Patrick and his staff are wonderful! They are patient and kind with our children, and have always worked to meet our needs.  If you are looking for an accommodating, friendly and professional staff, Desert Oasis is the office for you.
5 I.just have to say this is the best dental experience I've had since moving out here!  They are very professional from the front desk to the healthcare team.  Kudos to them.
5 Wonderful staff and wonderful dentist! My boyfriend went in to have a tooth extracted and they offered us excellent service with a good price. I will be returning, they did an amazing job!
