3 Why doesn't this store change the title to Barnes and Nobles instead of Bookstar?? The B&N sticker is on the windows.. Very strange.   Found lots of clearance items when I entered the store. It was so exciting to peruse through calendars, books, and Christmas items. I bought a Christmas toy since it was too cute to pass up.  I went into this store at 8:30pm, and was surprised that it closes at 10pm. Anyway, lots of books at this store and the store workers are friendly.
4 The first time I went in, I expected it to be the Wal-Mart of book stores.  But it's actually nice.  No, there isn't a cafe, but I like that.  It's a pet peeve of mine to see people camped out in the store reading a book or magazine they haven't paid for, nor have any intention of buying.  Go to a damn library people.  If I am paying for a new book, I want it to be...I don't know, NEW maybe.  Staff is always friendly.  I called looking for a particular book, and the gal who answered the phone not only checked the stock on their computer, but OFFERED to make sure it was actually on the shelf and held it for me.  They accept Barnes & Noble gift cards and membership cards as well.
