4 A very good place to have lunch, it's made fresh and won't disapoint.
1 Don't get kids meal with chicken nuggets!! Gross!! The workers are not friendly and the chicken you can plainly see are pre cooked in uncovered, undated containers in their cooler!!
5 The super steak is amazing and if you haven't tried it your missing out. They are under new management for the last few months and everything is properly covered and labeled. -new employee
