3 Despite hearing rave reviews for this place and seeing that they have won loads of awards, I find myself feeling slightly underwhelmed. When it comes down to it, it is a very average Thai restaurant. That's not to say it's terrible, just nothing special. And for the prices they charge, you would think they think they are.   I will admit, I am obsessed with Pad Thai, and their version was good, not spicy enough for my liking but nice. The thing is, 11 squid for a average bowl of prawn noodles seems a wee bit steep to me. My friends also had a duck and lychee curry and their analysis was the same, nice but a bit boring, and not worth the price. If you are looking for a good restaurant near there go to Thai Orchid instead, it is the best in Edinburgh, and Spicebox offers a delivery alternative which is similar but noticeably cheaper. For me this is the Ruan-g Thai to go to
4 If you come for lunch or an early dinner, the pricing is good. Seven pounds ninety five for a two course lunch. I had the Thom Yum noodle soup. Spicy and tangy.  The thai conversation coming from the kitchen was a nice atmospheric touch.
4 Nice Thai restaurant, very friendly service, good food & moderate prices.
