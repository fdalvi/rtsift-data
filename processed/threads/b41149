5 She does AMAZING work! I only go here for my nails, and for the last couple years I've been going to her, now I won't go to anyone else. Her gel art is one of a kind, very unique  and she is very good at what she does. She doesn't stop till your nails are perfect and what you want. You may even think your nails look amazing and she might not agree with her work so she will fix whatever she thinks is wrong and perfect it. Very kind and humble and I always have a blast spending time with her while getting my nails done!

She treats her clients with the utmost respect and she makes you feel like you are #1. If you are looking for quality nails, whether it be gels, acrylics, or anything I highly recommend going to see Miss Tabitha. You will not be disappointed!!!
5 10/10 would recommend Tabitha as your nail artist. She is great at what she does and has a great personality to boot!. I have been coming to Tabitha for several years now and she never disappoints.
