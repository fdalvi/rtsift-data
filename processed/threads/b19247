3 Went here when I was in Kitchener, Ontario visiting an old buddy from back in the day. Food was decent, wings were breaded, not my preference. Hot though. Pricey for the quality, $15+ for a wings dinner in a little college town.
4 The wings here are of excellent quality. You have a choice of original (which I prefer) or breaded (which they tell me is the popular choice).  There are plenty of flavours as well; dry rub, such as west coast, and your usual mild, medium, hot. Then there is sweet Thai. I just mentioned the ones I enjoyed. You can also ask for them sloppy.  The Wings Up is expensive buy worth it for really great wings and courteous service.
5 Okay, I haven't eaten here in about 2 years, but boy, do I miss those wings.  Their medium sauce was perfect for me, didn't taste like the usualy "Franks Red Hot" but had a tangy-ness to it and it was hot, but not too hot that I couldn't eat them. Yum! I always ordered mine breaded and extra sloppy. I love the veggies and ranch they would give.  They are a bit pricey but trust me, it's worth it!
4 Love the wings - tried several of the hotter flavors.
