5 I highly recommend Dr Stratton. He has a great staff and they do great work. I have had cleanings, root canals and caps. They are very customer oriented.  So glad I found them.
5 I have been with Dr. Stratton since the very beginning of his practice here in Henderson and I have to say that I am extremely pleased with the care and professionalism of him and his entire Staff... I would encourage anyone looking for a GREAT dentist in the Henderson, South Las Vegas area to make a point to check out Stratton Dental... Actually My son and I are on our way for cleanings tomorrow morning!
5 Dr. Stratton and his staff truly are the best!!!!  Very friendly and caring staff. Going to the dentist is NEVER fun for anyone, but you are made to feel at ease when you walk in the door.  I am a very happy customer/patient and highly recommend Stratton Dental.  High Five......Stratton Dental Team!
