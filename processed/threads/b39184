5 Dr Swanic is everything you could want in a doctor. He takes his time, is extremely thorough and explains everything in great detail.  He is fairly young meaning recently educated making him knowledgeable and proficient in all the latest ophthalmology science.  It is clear he loves his work and that translates into a wonderful patient experience.     He did, on separate occasions, cataract surgery on both of my eyes.  His recommendation for interocular implants was perfect.   I had seen a different doctor at Westfield eye who completely mis-diagnosed the proper treatment.  I feel Dr. Swanic did what was right for me and perfectly prescribed the correct treatment.   Proof is in the result:  My vision is better than any time in 50 years.  He is brilliant and can't be recommended highly enough.
5 Doctor Swanic is awesome! He saw me for my red painful eye the same day I had the problem. His exam and his explanation of my problem was thorough. As someone who works on eyelashes daily i couldn't be going to work with a red eye.  Fortunately, I was back to normal in just 2 days!
5 Doctor Swanic did a fantastic job on my LASIK.  He made me feel very comfortable and at ease with the process by thoroughly answering all my questions throughout the entire process, including each step of the follow-up. It is very clear that he truly cares about his patients, loves what he does, and is extremely knowledgable in his field.  I recommend him to anyone considering having LASIK!
