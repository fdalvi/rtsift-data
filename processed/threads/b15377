4 The guys here are pretty awesome. We came in one day, and unfortunately we had forgotten to check the allergy info on line before we came in. The cashier was very helpful, had a pamphlet ready, and actually looked at another one as we checked ours as well, just to make sure there wasn't anything we missed. Thanks for caring!
5 Good food, friendly people, quick service. All the things I like in a fast food place!  Very seldom have they botched my order or forgotten an item. When they do, they are quick to correct the problem.   Looking for guilty pleasures? Look no further than Jack In The Box for their delicious items.
1 I had the most horrible service possible! The drive thru person Brandon was so rude! After each item I ordered he asked " is that it" you never say that ask if my order is complete or suggest something. Then he didn't verify my order on screen. The total on screen showed 10.78 to pay I get to the window and was asked to pay 13.36?!!! I am pretty sure that is why you are supposed to verify the order! I didn't get a thank you or come again my food was shoved in my face and then he shut the window! I will not return to this jack because of this or any for that matter. Rude employees should be dealt with if I am a bother to you then find another job don't work in the industry that requires hospitality!
