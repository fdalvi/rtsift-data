1 I guess this place helps some people with their 10-15 minutes fixes, but to me it's too impersonal and not in depth enough each visit--and I don't like going back again and again and again when I KNOW what is wrong could be fixed in 2 longer visits as I've gone thru this same problem before one time.  I guess if you don't mind wasting the time and the money to drive back and forth this place is for you.  Plus, if you add up the cost of say 12 visits = $150 you could probably get yourself into shape cheaper with 2 longer visits somewhere else.   I just do not get the popularity of this outfit...shaking head....
4 Went in for my 1st consultation and received a treatment from Dr. Rumage (possibly misspelled). She was smart and knowledgable and was able to pinpoint my areas that were in pain. Setup for future appointments were made.   Pros: Price ($49 per 4 visits), Dr. Rumage, quick & convenient.   Cons: no X-Ray setup, quick (more detailed session needed for some people) & no massage therapy offered.  If you're looking for a quick adjustment this is your place. The 1st Dr. was awesome and hoping all that work there are like her, friendly, knowledgable & gets to the point.
4 Love this place!  Both doctors are knowledgeable, and extremely personable.  Both my husband and I go at least twice a month!  We love the no appointments necessary.  With a busy lifestyle the Joint has definitely made chiropractic care more accessible amd convenient.
1 Didn't even get an adjustment and I'm still disappointed!   I can't move on a Sunday and them being "open" on Sundays was ZERO help at all. I called to find out if they take insurance or how the process works (I've never been to or needed a chiropractor in my life) and the woman told me if I could be there in 4 minutes then they could see me, since they REQUIRE you to be there 1 hour prior on your first visit. Clearly that isn't gonna happen so I guess they're never getting my business. Help a pregnant girl out, jeez!
