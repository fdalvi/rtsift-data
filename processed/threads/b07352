3 Am I a bad person? A gross person? I really do love Subway.. time for honesty, I eat here at least 3 times a week.  It's only a block from my work and maybe that contributes to my Subway habit, or maybe it's the fact that the lunch crew knows my name. I hope this confession does not make me yucky.
5 Walked into this subway with a list of seven subs all custom orders; right during a lunch time rush... People behind the counter knocked it out pretty quick, and with a good attitude. Can't really ask for more than that.
4 This was a late night stop, and my gosh I was hungry.  The very nice counter person, made an amazing roast beef sandwich, and it was wonderful.  Then he threw in  cookies that go on sale tomorrow for half price....for half price NOW.  I got three oatmeal raisin cookies!  YUM!  All about customer service, and this subway has it! The store was clean, and the veggies were fresh .  I always check the restrooms, pretty clean for a late night.   all in all bravo.
