5 I've been going to Cheynes for around six years now and it is usually really busy and quite tight to walk around when getting from the area to have your hair washed to where you have the cut. I guess this is a sign of the popularity of the place.  The staff are really friendly and are always chatty. It can be a little pricey but no more than you would expect for a city centre established chain.
4 Stylist Joe has a knack for short hair. Always looks amazing and easy to style!  Truly....I never had short hair in my life until June, when Joe gleefully chopped it all off. While (honestly) telling me that he wouldn't do this for anyone who asked for it. Would want the person to be happy and suit the look. Not everyone does. Obviously. I don't love the price, but I love the service, experience and overall feeling of fabulousness I get when I leave. That's what makes me a repeat customer.   Which reminds me, I need to book an appointment. My hair is getting long ;)
