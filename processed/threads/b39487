5 Convenient location with a great set up for a private treatment in a relaxing environment to energize and detox.  Flexible scheduling and super friendly - absolutely recommend giving Health Vibes a visit.
5 Far infrared technology was rather foreign to me before finding this place. But wow, it has been a great discovery for me! I came here on a groupon only because my naturopath has been encouraging me to use a dry sauna once a week for detox purposes. It just so happens this place was in my neighborhood and the groupon was a really good deal, so I went for it.   My first treatment was interesting, I definitely sweat!! It took a few minutes, but once you start, the sweating just doesn't stop! Basically, infrared works by forcing the body to heat up from the inside. Your heart rate does increase and you even burn quite a few calories! For this reason, the tempe true is slightly lower than normal saunas, but don't get me wrong, it is hot!   After my first treatment, I felt suuuuuuuupppperrrrr relaxed the rest of the day, like, I could have slept right through to the next day. Since then I have increasingly gained more energy after each treatment. Jared, the owner, explained that this is normal. Another benefit for me is that it helps calm the inflammation in my hormonal acne. I'm 31, and have been really battling this acne problem lately, so I really appreciate the calming effects in my skin from this treatment.   Jared is super nice  and has been very helpful and courteous. This is a very small company, but they are super nice and have excellent customer service. You gotta love local businesses who appreciate their customers.   All in all, if you are looking to detoxify your body, fight illness or simply want to de-stress a bit, this sauna treatment is  an excellent addition to your health regimen. The package prices are very reasonable as well.... I'm glad I found this place!
