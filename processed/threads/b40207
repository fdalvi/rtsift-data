4 Megan Hubans was very helpful.   The equipment isn't as nice as the 215 location, but this one is cleaner and there's almost never a wait!
5 Always had a good experience at this location. Clean facility, fresh bulbs, nice staff. Great deals & offers. I don't know if I have been lucky, but there has never been a wait! Hope I didn't just "jinx" myself.. ;) Will be back.
2 I used to come to this place before they took over, I couldn't remember why I stopped, and due to convenience I came back.  It hit me today that I quit coming because their beds are INSANELY UNCOMFORTABLY HOT!!!! Seriously like the heat from a thousand suns hot.  Like Africa in a record high heat wave hot. I cannot stress this enough. You pay for the comfort and luxury of indoor tanning and walk out drenched in sweat hallucinating from dehydration.   After expressing the discomfort the girl behind the counter nodded and told me when I could cancel my membership (which I will).   Two stars cause it's clean.
