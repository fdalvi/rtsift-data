5 If you are looking for honesty and integrity in an HVAC company, you should consider Tate Wanless and Fresh Breeze Heating and Cooling.  I used Fresh Breeze for HVAC maintenance and I couldn't be happier.
5 I've personally used Fresh Breeze for years as well as referred my friends and family also.  They operate with the utmost integrity and have always given me a very fair price.
5 I'm a  single mother of 4 and just bought this home. I woke up at 3am to the sound of water leaking onto my carpet (coming from my smoke detector of all places). I got up in the attic and noticed the air conditioner unit had a small leak.  I emptied the drip pan that was overflowing to buy time before I could get someone out to look at the issue. I called Tate and told him I thought the pipes were clogged and needed to be snaked. He had Ben come over SAME DAY and got it taken care of. Come to find out, it wasn't clogged pipes but it was draining uphill.   Both Tate and Ben explained how things work and answered all my questions. What EXCELLENT customer service!!! I will for sure be using Fresh Breeze in the future for any of my A/C issues and I will be reccomending them to all my family and friends.
