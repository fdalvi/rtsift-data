5 The only downfall is hours; 10-8 mon- fri,10-7 sat and 12-4 on sun
4 Cheaper then KFC and tastes better in my book.
4 Well I actually went to the burger king right next door but the popeyes is a great place also. Borne places have great customer service. If you want something cheap not a bad place to go, but I recommend going after the lunch rush or you might be waiting for a bit.
3 It is popeyes and burger king combined it was my last meal before I started my weight loss for the year. Thanks for a good last meal.
4 What more can you say?  One thing I wish they had here that they do overseas is breakfast.  The Popeye's on bases overseas to a spicy chicken breast fillet with egg and cheese on a biscuit.
