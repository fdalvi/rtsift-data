5 Joshua is a fantastic hair dresser.  Very professional, on time, and friendly.  Takes great amount of time to discuss what type of cut will compliment your face shape.  Also offered to let me come back if I needed help with the new style.
5 Absolutely the best haircut I have ever had. Joshua spent a great deal of time determining the best cut for my face shape, body type, lifestyle, etc. My hair looks amazing and has never been easier to style and maintain.
5 Josh is great! I have been in Arizona for about 5 years and have bounced around stylists, never particularly thrilled. I am someone who wants my stylist to have ideas FOR me.. which I know sounds lazy, but I never know what to do! I visited Josh for the first time a few months ago and was so pleased!  Josh was very thoughtful and informative during my initial consultation and has since always given me great tips and suggestions. He is excited to share his knowledge with you about how to take better care of your hair and really make the most of his work. He spends a lot of time really focusing on the shape of your face and how to make the most of your features.. what kind of look would be best for you. He's fantastic..can't wait for my next visit!
