3 I went here last night before going to the movies. I had heard a lot of good things about this place so I didn't mind at all when Tanja R. suggested to have something to eat there.  We were greeted warmly at the door and chose a table. I had a glass of red wine and we shared a small bowl of olives as a starter.  The menu isn't particularly extensive, nor interesting. It has the usual selection of starters, followed by main courses of pasta, pizza, chicken, fish and steak. They do have some daily specialities, one of which was a vegetarian risotto on that day.  I asked about the pizzas and the waitress said she can ask the kitchen to make the base especially thin, as that is how I like them.   From our table we had a partial view to the kitchen. Food arrived quickly and soon I was tucking into a pizza with mozzarella, prawns and rocket. It had a thin base indeed and tasted very nice. Really enjoyed the house red as well.  Staff at Mia Restaurant are super friendly and accomodating. I would happily return to try some of the other dishes on the menu.
4 Yelp review- Mia Italian Restaraunt in Dalry, Edinburgh   July 1, 2014  A truly splendid visit. I arrived 10.45pm. Needed a glass of wine and food. Anything. I'd tried a fair few places to eat late. Had a really hard time with the horses and worked the fields late......  The staff here were great! They were able to bring me olives, then some superb bread and butter.  The pis de résistance was the tiramisu. The wine was brilliant too a lovely rich montipolcino (sp?).  Great menu.  Lovely sea bass. Can't wait to go back.   They have beautiful comfy sofa seats too.   I just think they are great. The were closing but served me with great thought and dignity ..... I looked like farmer!  It's a fairly swish place.   Ciao Mia!!
5 Busy Saturday night but our visit tonight could not have been better. The restaurant was rammed full but the wait staff were super friendly and attentive. We both ordered fish and my tuna in a caper and tomato sauce was pretty sublime. People often talk about food "melting in the mouth" and, food the first time, I can say this was just that. Mia's chef is a talented man! For pudding, I couldn't resist the tiramisu - it should be good being from an italian restaurant and it was. Not to coffee-ish and very creamy. Highly recommended all round and it deserves it's TripAdvisor top three placing. Mia is popular, though, so make sure you book early.
