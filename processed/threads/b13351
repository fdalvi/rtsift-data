4 I love this asian style spa. The owner has an unbelievable memory.  I hadn't been there in over 6 months and when I went back he asked me how my grandma's kidney is doing. I couldn't believe he remembered. that detail.  It's very clean and has impeccable decor.  Also, they are fast and efficient. I got a manicure, pedicure and wax in 60 minutes flat. They do your mani/pedi at the same time on the pedestal style massage spa chairs.  I love the hot towel they use on my legs and feet after each pedicure. The wax is never too hot like some other salons I have tried.    The manicurist's are very friendly and gave me a awesome sculptured nail using white powder for the french portion of my nail instead of white polish.  I definitely recommend Perfect Nails & Spa.
4 I couldn't find anything to add to the previous review except I have never had a bad experience here no matter who did my nails. They are reasonably priced, friendly and one of the few nail salons I have been to that seem genuinely interested in the customer returning. The owners are friendly and the selection of acrylic colors offered is excellent. If your a magazine reader you might want to bring your own as they only have people and entertainment mags, however I've only had to wait once in nearly a year.
4 They got my daughters and I in for pedicures and we were treated very well. We will be going again for Daughter & Mom day very soon :)
5 This is the best nail salon I've been to; clean and efficient. I've been using this spa for about 5 years now. I love the owners. Highly recommend this place.  Susan L, Glendale, AZ
