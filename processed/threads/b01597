4 So there is not much difference from one to the other, but what the hell.  This is the closest one to me and is on the way to work.  I will stop by on occasion to grab a quick smoothie before work.  They are consistent each and every time I go in.  The kids that work there are actually friendly and personable.  Unlike a lot of places that hire the younger people in the workforce.  This place is OK with me.  The parking lot leaves a little to be desired.  You can only go right or you can wait an interminable amount of time to go left out of the other entrance/exit.  You will also be risking your life by doing so.
4 I love this location. Even though they've been playing musical chairs with the staff over the last five and a half years I've been frequenting this establishment, the quality of the product and the service has remained high. The fruits and vegetables are of a consistently high quality and new flavors and combinations are popping up on a regular basis. This is one of the best locations in the valley and if you're lucky enough to show up ten minutes before closing you might even get a free treat. Keep up the good work and happy holidays!
1 The respect from the workers there was flat garbage. I got a text saying you can get a buy one get one free smoothie. I go in there and ask them about the buy one get one free and the cashier denies it exists. I have the text and it came from Jamba Juice. He had NO respect towards me. Later, he completely ignored me. I used to come to this Jamba Juice a lot and now I'm not. If they get nicer staff that have better attitudes then I will consider coming back. But until then i will never come back. If I can give this place a negative 10,000,000 stars I would. Customers would be happier if Jamba Juice on Thunderbird Road got new staff. This is pitiful!!!!
4 Love this Jamba Juice.  The bo-go coupons come through so often that it makes it tough to go there without one.  I have to modify my order to make it dairy.  Pet peeve- it's "sherbet", not "sher-beRt".  There is no second "r".  If you're in the smoothie biz, please say it right.
5 Jamba Juice always does great! The store is always extremely clean and employees are very courteous.
5 Super friendly staff providing delicious drink and food options. I'm always greeted with a smile. This Jamba Juice is consistent with all the others. Same decor, drink and food options. They also sell pre made sandwiches that are sitting in a small cooler.
