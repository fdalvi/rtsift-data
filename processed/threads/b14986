5 I love Native New Yorker!  I frequent the Gilbert and Germann location usually.  Bartender Angela and server Victoria are my favorites :)  The wing specials on Tuesday and Thurday paired with a nice cold beer, make going out to eat super cheap and enjoyable.  I love the variety of sauces they offer for the wings also.  Friday nights are karaoke and that is a blast!
4 It's a sports bar. Well at least the side I go to. The other side is a restaurant but I wouldn't be throwing out 4 stars for their food!  Big HD TVs! Lots of them... That is what we want in a sports bar, right? Plus, they buy all of the sports PPV stuff. Cold beers, Big HD TV's, chicken wings and the game - this makes me happy!
3 Went there on Saturday night, wasn't that busy. We sat in the lounge and did like the amount of TV's with different sporting events. Waited about 5 minutes for a server (not ours) to come and take our drink order. About 10 minutes later our drinks came, then waited for another 10 minutes for our server to take our food order. All we ordered was an appetizer, which took about 20 minutes....point I am making is it took a long time to place and receive drinks/food. The NNY Combo Platter was good, not sure the wait is worth it though!
1 The crossroads of bad food and worse service. Some of the food was so bad that one taste made you spit it out. The rest of the food was cold. The server was never to be found. We had to get up and search through the restaurant four different times when we needed our server. Don't waste your time or money here. Your better off eating fast food.
4 Enjoyed quite atomosphere good food and great service
