5 The ONLY place to buy good beer for a reasonable price in Vegas.  So many great deals and so many delicious IPAs and microbrews.  The selection is always changing, and they usually have some deal where if you pay cash, a 6-pack of yummy nectar is only $4.99!  Some recent $4.99 deals have included Indica IPA, Full Sail IPA, and Fire Rock Pale Ale.  Why pay more?  They also have a ton of wine & liquor of course but I go there for the beer.  Cheapest place around and best selection.  I think this Rancho location is bigger than the others too.
5 This place is like the costco of liquer stores it has everything you need from beers to wine and all the booze you can think of and it is a good price also. we always stop by this place to get everclear and booze for the hotel room they also sell cigars there to.
2 There are many Lee's Liquors in Vegas. As a matter of fact, they have a chokehold the way Walmart has throttled a lot of mom and pop places into submission across America. They are best by virtue of being the biggest.   The Green Valley location is the best by far. But this Rancho location has something special. Employees who do the things that make ordinary folk not wish to step into this kind of establishment in the first place. Things such a chug a 90 proof slug ( super-sized, of course ) of bourbon that would make W. C. Fields roll over in his grave. I can't even put away that  much soda in a single gulp, let alone Wild Turkey in a day. These guys do love MEGA-sampling- I guess to be able to give "experienced" info to their customers. burp.  But to be fair, this location does manage to have a decent selection of choices across the board. Knowledgeable staff is another thing though. No, I don't need some 60ish biker "babe" drawl on about the wonders of JD and coke Been there, done that. Once,.when my tastes were a tad less refined. But do watch they don't double charge you. Happened to me on some mini's. Dammit.  Back to plusses. They sometimes have Rums such as Angostura 1919, Zaya, and will occassionally have a cash-only sale on items that really save you big. So all is not lost. If you live real close, it's not too bad if you can stand the tobacco waft, aren't offeded by vulgar language, and want to make a mad likker dash.
5 Good selection, great prices, friendly staff - what more do you want in a liquor store?!
3 I keep seeing these awsome commercials for Lee's discount liquor and decided to pop in to check it out.  I could not find the virtual bartender at this location.  Not saying they don't have one, just didn't find it.  I searched for airplane size bottles but didn't notice them until I checked out because they were stocked in a corner of the store.  Three bucks for one gulp doesn't scream "discount" to me.  I couldn't find the size bottles I wanted, but they did have a huge selection.
4 This is a really great place to buy all your liquior needs! Its cheap and most definitely a spot if your friends are out in vegas and need to pre game before heading out of the hotel. Theres a bunch located in vegas!
4 One of the oldest Lee's, it has seen better days, but they have recently made some improvement inside and being so close to the Draft House, helps as well.  Although not the best craft beer selection, they have a very good one, and I can usually find most of the Stone and other specialty beers.  My biggest complaint would be they run out of Anchor Steam too often.
4 Closest Lee's to the house and this has been the shabbiest one I've been to. Now, ambiance isn't too important since you're getting drinks and getting out but those aisles are narrow. I had to not move while I was looking at a beer shelve or else someone passing would get elbowed or I'd get a shopping cart to the hip. Makes it hard because behind you is the fridge so people are opening doors as well which block the way (see pic).   I give it a positive rating because the beers looked full and I don't think the craft beers have as heavy a turnover at this location (even though it's right next to a brewery) as a high volume store like the Lake Mead one or Green Valley. More beers= more for us.   We walked out with:  Rogue Dry Hopped St Rogue Red- which has been the BFs favorite lately.  14th anniversary Stone Emperial IPA Dogfish Head Burton Baton (I see people are buying the year round stuff because of the show which is pretty amazing to me).  Happy haul, so can't complain too much.
4 Always have what I need and want!! Those little shooter things are amazing and the gag gifts at the register are Hilarious and prefect for stocking stuffers,easter baskets and bachelorette parties!! you have to see what i am talking about!! hehe!! :D
4 Lee's Discount Liquor is exactly  what the name says... A place where you can get your liquor (and beer) for a discount. They have a much larger selection than your local grocery store for both wine and liquor, generally at a cheaper price. But don't expect to get a ton of help. I've been in liquor stores where employees can answer any question you have. Here, the only employee I saw was the cashier, who admitted to knowing nothing about the bourbons I was deciding between. Instead, I turned to my smart phone and got the answers I needed.   I was excited, as they have pear cider. Smith's only carries apple, and only 2 brands at that. The wine selection seemed nice, but I have a 2-buck chuck palette, so I can't speak to the quality of their wine selection. The price range seems to suggest many quality options but you never really know with wine.  Overall, I give Lee's a 4-star review. That they are locally owned is a plus, as is the sheer quantity of options. The lack of help was a bit disappointing, and the reason I cannot give them a 5-star rating. I will be back the next time I want to try a new liquor.
5 If I were to buy a home in Las Vegas it would have to be around Rancho and Craig because it's next to two great establishments, The Draft House and Lee's Discount Liquor.    But then again I'm not sure my liver would stand for that.     Lee's is awesome.   They have a great selection of beers, wines and spirits at very reasonable prices.    The staff has been friendly, but I've found it to be more fun to walk up and down the aisles to see what goodies they have for sale.    The last time I was there bought a Delirium Tremens and an Arrogant Bastard.    Mmmm mmmm...  good to find them both in the same spot.     Will I be back?  Of course I will.
3 Their prices are decent, and they have a relatively okay selection of beer/wine/spirits, but I was fairly put off by the fact that neither one of the employees on duty had ever heard of Lillet or Aperol. I realize that French and Italian apertifs are a little off the beaten path, but this IS a liquor store. No?
3 I was as lost wandering down the aisles of this Lee's as I am driving down the streets of this side of town. The aisle markers are not updated yet since they reorganized their wine section.   Other than that, the employees walking around the facility are all friendly and helped guide me in the right direction. Most of the time, Lee's is the place to stock up for any party. The prices are some of the lowest of any liquor store.
3 I frequent this store only because it's closer to my house than any other. The prices are low and the selection is usually ample. I have had to go elsewhere for the whipped cream vodka and the Godiva Liqueur when they've run out before.
4 A quick stop at Lee's and the weekend is underway. The selection is large, but the aisles are not. You've got to be careful walking through here or a serious party foul is in order. I was impressed with the friendly staff as I watched their interaction with the customers. They carry Tito's vodka, which was so highly recommended by a friend that I had to grab a bottle and give it go. The beer at Lee's is some of the coldest in town. A return trip is definitely in order.
5 PROS: This Lee's is pretty big and has a really good selection of all things alcohol! My favorite part about this location is that it has a huge selection of beers and a sizable collection of sake, and other foreign drinks.  CONS: Be careful, I've seen many a people knock over bottles in this place; it's so overstocked that bottles are practically hanging off the edges of shelves.
3 Years ago, when I lived in Las Vegas, I felt that Lee's was the place to go for all of my needs; pertaining to alcohol that is. However, on my most recent trip back to Las Vegas, I stopped in, hoping to grab some beer for a family gathering - only to leave wondering how I could ever have felt that way ...   The craft beer aisle was basically one row if you don't include what was in the coolers. Management must not have contracts with the breweries because the selection was very limited. If I wanted some wine or some of the "hard" stuff, that wouldn't have been an issue.   Prices were definitely better than the local grocery stores for the beer I could compare however, Lee's cannot compare to the stores I now frequent to find my adult beverages.   I will say, the staff is friendly and helpful. I was approached twice, by two different employees asking if I needed any help finding something.
5 Classic Lee's....superb quality, great selection, cheap prices. East side or Northwest it doesn't matter they always deliver.
