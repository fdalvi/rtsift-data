1 I almost choked to death on my free water when I saw the "Like Infiniti on Camelback" for Facebook. This was probably the worst car buying experience of my life with the exception of Pinnacle Nissan. These dummies let me walk from the bargaining table not once but twice. Unwilling to budge for under  800 dollars their negotiation skills are total crap. Best to stick with the smaller car dealers  for pre-owned vehicles. I was not surprised to find out that the company that owns Pinnacle Nissan also owns Infiniti on Camelback. Word of advice salesmen, don't let the customer leave angry. They will probably delete this post on their Facebook Page so I will also put it on Yelp.
1 Horrible customer service.  Their iPhone site says open on Sundays for service.  Well guess what this changed in march (3 months ago) and they never bothered to change it o. Their mobile site.    To top it off, some jerk salesman tried to joke around that he would do my repairs for me.  Then he told me that I was wrong, until I showed him my iPhone with the I correct information.  You'd be best off going to another dealership where they have an accurate Internet site and don't insult their customers.
1 I came to test-drive a car and all of the questions I asked the salesman read the answers directly off the sticker. Since I am a literate person, that wasn't necessary nor was it relevant as the questions I had about the vehicle didn't have answers that could have been found on the sticker. Yeah, I do my own research before I waltz into these places and when I ask questions I expect my "expert" sales guy to answer them as he is supposed to know what he's selling, right? I had to leave.  The next day, Salesguy Einstein called me. And then a few days later. And again, a few days after that. I'll give him that for at least being persistent. But he thought the price was the problem - not the car itself, which I decided I didn't like anymore after I drove it, and he was leaving me these ridiculous messages about selling me a "used Mercedes." It was all really annoying and embarrassing to listen to.
1 Will never buy from them again.  They are the worst. Don't take your car for service there either, and if you are looking for a warranty, don't buy it from them. Try some of the other dealers for a MUCH better price.
1 Will never buy a Infiniti again based on the experience with this dealship. I purchased my truck in April and the finance manager understood that the truck was to be registered in Michigan they gave me 90 day tag. I waited a month and called the dealership to find out what happened, come to find out that he registered the truck in Arizona, So I called the main Infiniti financial corporate offices and they said that they will fix the mistake and send the stuff over to Michigan. Again I called the state of Michigan and they said they never received anything. So once again I had to call the corporate office, they said they sent the original title and they would have to order a new one for AZ DMV. Well my tag expired so I went to the Dealership on camelback and after waiting 2 hours after they told me to be there for there finance manager to get there. He was able to print me out a 30 day tag. At that time I was parked in the service entrance and asked about the weather stripping on the roof racks, the guy that came out from service said he has seen this happen before and he needed to order new roof racks and when they came in they would need to be painted to match the truck. He took all my information and said he would call me when they came in. Its now 2 months since then, I have called service 4 times to get an update each time they could not find the order nor could they even find the VIN and asked me if I was calling the correct place and there's no way that I purchased the truck there. I have left messages with the sales manager RICK, the service manager BILL and talked with the salesman Brent who said he would look into it.   ALSO with not having the weather stripping the inside of the truck has water spots form the rain and car washes.
1 This dealership has the worst sales reps (Mark, Richard, Justin and the entire gang of scamsters). They called me thrice to the showroom promising a particular price when we spoke on the phone. The first 2 times I went to their showroom they backtracked on the price. In fact, I was looking for a specific pre-owned car which I had test-driven, and they phoned me multiple times (15-20) to strike a deal. When I finally agreed to their price, the fixed an appointment for the same day, but when I went to the showroom I was told that the car was already sold 3 days ago. Thats when I learnt that these are their business/marketing tactics to sell other cars to me.  The managers here have no courtesy at all , not even basics like offering a seat/chair to the customer. He made us stand in his cabin (while he was sitting on his chair) and was totally unapologetic for wasting so much time and for his sales reps being so unprofessional with us. He was behaving (and insulting) us if it is our own fault that we fell into their trap. Totally unprofessional. Stay away from this dealership and its fraudulent salesmen.
1 Just got off the phone with JUSTIN, who said he was the GM at this unethical dealership.  The slimy sales tactics that these guys use to gain interest in their cars are enough to have to share.  It's the absolute definition of "Bait and Switch":  Day 1 (10/7) - First Phone Call: Mark (Sales): "There's currently another buyer interested in the vehicle and they have placed a deposit on it.  But I will call you back with more information"    Day 1 - Second Phone Call One Hour Later: Mark (Sales): "There's been a misunderstanding, and no one has a deposit on the car.  But you better move fast"  Day 2 (10/8) - Phone call: Mark (Sales): "Turns out there was a buyer who has put a deposit on the vehicle and I have them on the other line (As I hear Justin coach him on what to say in the background), but if you make a higher offer we can sell it to you today!"  ME: "Let me talk to the guy coaching you in the background"  Justin goes on to tell me that I would need to offer $3,000 over the internet sales price to have the car.  I then ask him: "So what you're saying is that the person who has a deposit on the car chose to pay $3K over the advertised sales price for it BEFORE taxes and fees?  Can you explain that to me?"  Justin: "I don't have to. What price do you want to pay for the car?"  ME: "OK.  Based off the research I've done, you've priced this car lower than other dealerships in the area, but it's still far off from the actual value of this car based on it's true market value.  I would like to pay $XX"  Justin: "You won't be able to find a dealership within 500 mi that has this car for that price."  ME: "Of course I wouldn't.  If the true value of the car to the consumer was valued to be $XX, why would the dealership list it at that price?  They wouldn't be profitable."  Justin: "What do you do for a living?"  ME: "I work in sales"  Justin:  (Changes subject) "You do understand that even if we sold you this car for the internet price, you'd still end up paying a couple thousand in dealer fees?"  ME: "A couple thousand?  Can you break that down for me?"  Justin: "We upgrade our vehicles with wheels, window tint, paint protection, etc"  ME: "So you force your customers to pay for these upgrades that they did not even request so that you can tack on even more profitability at the end of the deal?  Is this legal?"  Justin: (Changes subject) "So is $XX your final offer?  I don't want to have Mark waste his time calling you back if it is."  End of Conversation.  All the while, what happened to that buyer you had on the "other line" for the past 30 min???
1 Tried to use a VPP number and the finance guy tried to tell me he was giving me a better deal than the VPP price! Sales guy was a good guy but won't go back!
5 SERVICE CENTER REVIEW ONLY:  I am a little intimidated writing a positive review considering those that have gone before me, but, from a service perspective, I have never had anything but a great experience.   I own a 2011 Infiniti that I purchased used from another dealer and have come to Infiniti on Camelback for all my maintenance and a couple minor repairs.  Shelby has been great to work with as a service adviser, which can make a world of difference.  For the items not covered under warranty, I feel their charges are reasonable (for a dealership) and never had unnecessary items pushed on me.    Getting a convenient appointment has always been easy and the service / repairs have been completed quickly.  A couple times I have waited for the vehicle and they keep you updated on when it will be ready.  Not that it really matters to me, but their waiting room is separate from the showroom and very clean and quite, complete with bottled water, an espresso machine and WiFi.
1 That was a terrible experience. Made an appt to test drive a car (q50 tech) which I confirmed they had in stock. Showed up, car is missing - and they lost the key for the other car in stock. Really? What's the point of making an appointment? Typical experience I'd expect at a ford dealership - definitely not one I'd expect from a "luxury" brand.
1 Ahhhh now I get it, look at the reviews people!  We stopped in to look at a vehicle there and 4 phone calls in 24 hours from Gary, who lacks complete professionalism, to hard sell us to come back in, is what your in for.  I asked him politely not to call me and he continues to do so.  Don't even drive on the lot, you'll be sorry.
