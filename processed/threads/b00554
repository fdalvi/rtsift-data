1 This is the second branch of this bank I've tried to go to (to help my Daughter cash a check) that has turned out to be out of business.  I'm tired of wild goose chases.
1 The customer service at the drive thru really is poor. I frequently go to this branch because it's the closest to my home, I go at least once a week. I've only been greeted and been told to have a great day once since May 2012 (when I started going to this branch). Today when I informed the teller that I was given someone else's receipt she didn't even say thank you or apologize for the mistake. Unfortunately, this is the only branch in my area so I have to ignore the poor drive thru service or tryout the inside service which is an inconvenience for me because I usually have my 1 year old son with me.
1 be warned!!!   from my experience if you bank with arizona federal you are opening yourself up to losing your money, potential identity theft, and many days full of frustration while you "become one of them".    * outdated technology- hard to find information on their website and limited self service capabilities * contacting a live person will take up to 5 minutes! * fees applied incorrectly and excessively by arizona federal * problems can only occur from monday - saturday 9 am to 3pm * criminals welcome to take all the customer's money in the evenings and during the weekends * rude customer service agents that do not respect "members" * "be one of us" brainwashing slogan should really say, "if you are stupid, rude, and like other people stealing your money and being blamed for it, then join arizona federal and "be one of us!"
