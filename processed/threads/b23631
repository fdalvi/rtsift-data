3 Everyone is very professional and competent, but I have not lost any weight. The surgery went well, and the coaching that the health workers provide is great, but delivered in a hurry to get patients in and out as quickly as possible.  Regardless of what True Results sells you, the weight loss will still be up to the individual.  The lap band makes you eat smaller amounts and much more slowly, but you can make up for this with greater frequency!
1 On line ad for True Results states they take "most Insurances". I have insurance but after having been seen by True Results for 6 months seeing the NPs, dietitian, Exercise therapist, psychologist and being told that my insurance had declined to pay for the lap band I found out by speaking with my insurance that True Results NEVER submitted the paperwork ! True Results evidently decided perhaps they didn't want to accept want my insurance would have paid. They push push push their "Care Credit" payment plan for the 10 thousand dollar procedure. Perhaps that is how they make their money, rather than accepting the discounted price the insurance companies will pay! Just beware and make sure if you do have insurance that it is submitted ! Or be prepared to pay for procedure out of pocket.
5 I had my surgery through True Results of Phoenix in Scottsdale back on August 16th, 2013 and I am currently down 72lbs. While I love the staff and tools provided for me, I must say it is my own will power that pushes me to be successful. I am the one that gets my butt up off the couch and I am the one putting in the work to change my life to be a better healthier me. My main goal is to be healthy for me. Thank you Lapband for being the key to me starting this new journey :)
