3 This food court has Starbucks, Dairy Queen, Subway, Wendy's, Panda Express, Del Taco, and much more. Some places like Subway may be a bit more pricey than other Subways (I remember getting 2 foot-long subs for almost $30...without a drink).
3 On the plus side. Fast food all in one place and open all night long... Down side? Everything is so bloody pricey? Okay I know you are Las Vegas, I know you are on the strip... But there is no reason a bloody tall drip at a Starbucks should be $2.95 before tax.   3 robs-ya-like-a-casino stars out of 5
3 A small food court located by M&M world store.  They have the usual food court vendors; subway, wendy's, Asian food, pizza and a Mexican place.  Not a bad place to go if you are in the area and need to grab quick and cheap food.
4 A hidden gem ! Our favorite late night stops on the strip! Hubby loves Del Taco, I love Panda Express... good place to go sober up after a heavy night of drinking and gambling!
