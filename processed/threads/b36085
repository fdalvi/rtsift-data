5 Brad and Joe are two great attorneys. Really I look at them as the skill and integrity guys for accidents and injuries. I have seen them working as a colleague for many years and highly recommend them. They are true litigators, meaning they don't just try to settle cases that need to go to court for justice. That says a lot considering how so many attorneys here in Las Vegas just seem to try to settle quickly regardless of what's best for the client.
5 I came to Brad Mainor after a car accident I was in; one of my friends had used his firm and said they were extremely professional and helpful. So glad I did, because even though my case was small he treated me with the utmost respect and fought hard for me in court. He was very thorough in explaining the process and made me feel at ease. If you're looking for a law firm that treats clients like family and truly cares about the outcome of every case, then this is the one to call.
5 Brad and Joe helped my grandparents settle their case after being involved in a car accident. Their staff was helpful and kept my grandmother informed every step of the way. My family is very happy with the results, as well as the care and professionalism shown by everyone at Mainor Wirth. I wouldn't recommend anyone else to my friends or loved ones.
1 Worst PI firm in Vegas!  Poor customer service and they did not help with anything on my case!  I felt as though I had to do everything for them...I thought I was paying for an attorney!  I went months without hearing from anyone, and my case was transferred to a new girl and she was amazing!  Tried to make my experience a little better, and did exactly what she said she was going to do!  The attorney I got never contacted me or met with me after my initial consultation!
