5 I really love the products and service I have received from Boxed Greens. The unique and delicious produce is amazing and I love the fact that I can order it all over the phone and have it delivered to my front door. They even carry my favorite cleaning supplies!!!!!
5 This is the way food should taste!!  I remember eating tomatoes right out of my grandmother's garden and the organic fruits and vegetables from Boxed Greens taste just as fresh!!  Things from the store just are not the same or as healthy for you.  The earl ybird option for us works great.  Like getting fresh milk "back in the olden days".  (not that I'm that old).  If there is ever a problem I can call them up and the friendly staff is willing to solve the problem right away. You won't go wrong by making the healthy   choice by ordering from Boxed Greens!!
5 I have been receiving 90% of my food from Boxed Greens every week. Everything is top quality and delivered cold and fresh. Boxed Greens has eliminated the need for grocery stores in my life.  Nobody can beat the selection, quality, or friendliness of the staff.
