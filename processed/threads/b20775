4 My boyfriend and I took the plunge... and got a hamster together.  Vic Mackie, as we named him, hailed from this store. Such a tiny little soldier, we picked him from his home filled with so many other hamsters. A nice member of stuff took as around the store pointing out things we needed. Who knew a hamster needed so much crap? Clearly it's all a big sales pitch, because if you don't go along with it and buy everything she tells you to then you look like a cruel potential pet owner.   The store is pretty big selling just about anything you need for your pet and more. It gets a little extreme in some cases, like how many different types of dog biscuits can it be? I like to look at the animals (rabbits, hamsters, mice and guinea pigs). There is a special section at the back for the eh... special animals which you can ''adopt''. I have never quite understood why they need their own section but I always feel sorry for them.
3 I thought the best place to go to stock up on the essentials for the new addition would be a big store.  Whilst I can't fault the helpfulness/knowledge of the staff & the range/selection of stuff on offer, the essentials are very expensive here. Kitten food is 30% more than the supermarket, that's not even with an offer on in the supermarket & cat litter is also cheaper in most of the big supermarkets. Good selection of brands & choice but needs to be more competitive on price to keep my custom.
