5 Charles at Agape Pool Service does such a great job at pool cleaning. He takes the extra time to do a great job and is not in a rush to move on to the next job. He is honest and reliable and there is no concern with him entering the property while away. He is also very knowledgeable about pool cleaning and always answers any questions. He is also very reasonable and his service included all of the needed chemicals. It is a welcomed change to see a pool cleaner that cares about his reputation and does an honest job. He also really loves to clean pools. Don't know how he does it in the hot sun. Always a pleasure to see him at work. I highly recommend him!
5 I would HIGHLY recommend Agape Pool Service. I am amazed at how much care Charles puts into cleaning our pool each week. He takes his time, is knowledgable, and the pool looks perfect every single time he leaves.
5 I had the hardest time keeping up with my pool having a small family. With 3 kids under 5 years old, I was not able to keep my pool clean and regularly fought the algae battle. There hasn't been a day since I had Charles take over cleaning my pool that I don't feel good about my decision. I always have a crystal clear pool and know I can trust Charles to maintain it to the highest standards.
