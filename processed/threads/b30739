5 Great value for down home food. THey have both filipino and italian food. IT's an interesting mix but they make it work. I like their chicken on skewers. Their adobo is also always good. I haven't tried any of their italian cuisine but i'm sure that's good too. I love their cheap prices and friendly service. This is just what I needed and it reminded me of home. Vegas is my 2nd home but it's more my playground. I needed that bite of HOME to settle my stomach from the previous night's libations
1 quite frankly this place is really NOT that good... This place doesnt represent the great quality of filipino food! where in the world do u see bell pepper nd cabbage in Kare-Kare ... but i guess if you are that hungry its okay :))
5 The place is secluded so it's hard for people to notice. It's located inside Aruba Hotel in downtown LV. Their food  is awesome though!  trust me, their sisig is way better than Cafe Moda's. Their Kare Kare is good too. I didn't see any cabbage or unnecessary ingredients in it. Their breakfast plates are served all day and they are good and affordable as well. They also serve Italian, Mexican, and American foods. They have Mahalo Fridays which is a Hawaiian theme but with awesome new dance music. All in all this place is not bad.
