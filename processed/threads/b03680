4 It's like Christmas threw up in there....but in a good way.  Sure, I could only afford about 10% of the items in there, but it was a wonder to walk around and see all the millions of items available for your viewing pleasure.  There were balls, balls, and more balls!  Christmas balls, that is.  I treated myself to some teal balls.    I saw Christmas chickens, odd high heeled stockings with faux fur, freaky bald statuettes with crowns, beds that looked like they were whittled by some extremely talented but extremely bored person, a lot of bling, and lots of other things I can't even remember.    Prices ranged from very reasonable, to expensive but understandable, to ridiculously -why would anyone spend that much money on decor- priced items.  The staff was very friendly, and not at all pretentious as you might think, going into a store like that.  Rustic STUFF indeed.  I'll go now and hang my balls.  :)
5 This store is pretty cool and I am not one to like stores like this--so that should tell you something about how cool it is.  Wife and I have visited about a half dozen times and they redo the store for each holiday. Halloween is sooo cool--my fave! Totally gothic setups and store is laid out to look like different rooms you walk through.  Some stuff is pricey, but I think they troll the world looking for items. But you search and can find some really unique, decently priced items for your house. The owners are very nice.
4 Nice store was not expecting such high end furnishings and accessories, but many items reasonably priced. I will actually be back.
5 AHMAZING store! Creative and stunning vignettes throughout the whole place. Not cheap, not even inexpensive, pricey is the word, but you have to pay to be unique sometimes. definitely a treat to see the store, smell the store, touch the things in the store and if you are lucky enough, bring home a special treasure.  It is magical especially this time of year! I love that the employees let you browse without bombarding you with tacky sales pitches. They are there to assist, but let you take it all in at your own pace.
