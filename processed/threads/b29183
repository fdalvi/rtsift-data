5 What gives Robert Graham's new Cigar Store an edge over other cigar stores in the city is simple: their passion for all things Cuban.   Alongside well known cigar brands like Cohiba, Partagas and Romeo y Julieta, they stock beautiful, limited edition boxes of 10 and 25 Montecristo Edmundo, Bolivar Petit Belicosos, Juan Lopez Seleccion Suprema and El Rey del Mundo Choix de L Epoque. To compliment the smokes, they also have a small selection of Cristal and Cubanero Fuerte beer, Havana Club rum and Mojito mixers.   The thing that makes me adore the store however, is the fab cigar box guitar in the window. A homage to blues guitars like Muddy Waters, Son House and Carl Perkins, its made from empty cigar boxes, beer tops, baling wire and tins.
4 Really fresh cigars... Excellent sprit parings... Homage to Cuba!
5 I actually had no idea this place was a cigar store. We were on the Royal Mile for only a day, and I wanted to buy some small bottles of whisky, but didn't want to get completely ripped off. I kept checking stores and kept being dismayed by how much the prices varied. Finally we stopped into this one and, unlike the others on the Royal Mile, the store was staffed by a nice friendly young man who offered my sister and me some tastes, and spoke knowledgeably about other offerings he wasn't able to sample. Their price on a miniature of Glenfarclas 15 was also the best I'd seen all day by quite some distance (£5.50 vs £8-10 elsewhere), so I felt comfortable buying from them, and the pleasant service helped to seal the deal. I don't know if I got the absolute best prices possible, but in a sea of tourist traps, I was quite reassured to not have gotten completely fleeced. Hope this helps other tourists!
