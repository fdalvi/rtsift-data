5 After moving out of my home of 9 years located in Scottsdale, AZ, I hired Momentum Brokers Property Management to lease and manage my home. I would recommend Ashley at Momentum Brokers to every investor or single-family home owner looking for solid support and solutions. My home received an application 3 days after being listed on MLS and per Ashley's recommendations, was priced just right. I continue to receive on-going support and know my house turned Real Estate Investment is in good hands. Great Job Ashley! Great Job Momentum Group!
5 Had a great experience selling our home and buying a new home through momentum brokers. Sometimes agents will "encourage" you to love every house you walk into just so they can get the sale done, this wasn't the case with MB. I would definitely recommend them and will use them in the future !
