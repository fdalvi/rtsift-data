5 I have only used this CVS several times for the storr only.  They always have items on sale in stock.  I have had the same cashier all the times I have been there, he so friendly and seems interest in your day.  Awesome young dude.  The CVS Bonus Rewards are a plus!
5 The pharmacists and pharmacist assistants at this CVS pharmacy are absolutely wonderful.  Super fast, very organized and they are all extremely friendly.  I am so thankful that we switched from another chain pharmacy to this CVS - the customer service level is night and day compared to our last pharmacy.  Way to go CVS!
5 I went into CVS last night because I thought I might be coming down with the flu and thought it would be a good idea to stock up on some over the counter medicine. When I arrive at the store I wasn't quite sure what medicine would be the appropriate medicine to take.  The pharmacist took the time to answer all my questions even suggested a medicine that would work best. I normally do not go to CVS for my prescriptions or over-the-counter drugs. However this will be the place I come in the future. You can't beat this type of customer service. In fact the customer service is so good and fast I didn't have time to walk the aisles looking at the random items you find in drug stores.
