5 Why do things seem to go wrong on a weekend?  and at night?  My tenant texted me on a Saturday night that their AC had gone out AGAIN!! This was the 4th time.  I had used another AC Service for the first 3 outages.  Frustrated and not understanding why we continued to have problems (was it the tenant?  was it the other company?) I called Honest Air -- referred to me by my brother who said he has used him often and felt it did great work for him always (2 different properties).  So I called on a Sunday and Jeff was out that morning.  Listened to the tenant describe a clicking noise he hears, (something he described to the former AC company also each time) - Jeff knew exactly what it was, made the repairs and was in and out in 15 minutes.   No Further problems.  Responsiveness is great!  Work is great!  Pricing $50 less than the other company's "standard" call pricing.
5 This is by far the best Air Conditioning people I've ever encountered. Their pricing was extremely fair. All work was installed quickly and without a glitch. They responded quickly on my first unit repair, so I gave them a chance when I finally bought a new one. They will be my air-conditioning people for as long as I live in Mesa, Arizona.
5 Called this place because my usual air conditioning tech was not available.  I am very pleased with the service I received. They technician was exactly on time and was professional, polite and courteous. They didn't perform extra work and didn't charge me for unnecessary repairs.  They gave me several suggestions for preventative maintenance and tips on filter changes.   I highly recommend!!  Did I mention they came out the same day I called?
