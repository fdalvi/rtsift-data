5 Fast friendly service with your choice of toppings on salsa, lime, and jalepenos. The fish tacos in corn are a traditional favorite!
1 They should have an ad in the paper food employees that should say, "must have teeth." Seriously, if you're going to run the registers, wear your dentures!! And the food sucked! I couldn't get a good meal to save my life that day. Geez!
1 I just ate here yesterday afternoon. I had 3 fish tacos. Today I am suffereing from food poisoning. How lovely.
4 since I work close by, I thought I would walk to some places for lunch.  One day I tried Rubio's. I had the gourmet tacos and thought they were tasty and seemed fresh.  I went back the next day and had the gourmet shrimp burrito, enjoyed it. The place was crowded which is good for the business and everyone seemed nice and friendly.  The owner chatted with me and I can recommend the place for a quick bite. The tables and condiment area were clean as well. Try it. Support Mesa!
5 Working close by was a benefit, but now that I've moved I still find time to stop by and have some tacos. Staff is friendly and restaurant is clean.
4 Always Good Food and Service  Every time I go it's the same - the food is good and the service is attentive and friendly.
5 I am in Love with their Original Fish Taco!  the service is Always friendly and attentive. Kudos to their fry cook, they fry and sauce those tacos with love, lol.
4 Good job tonight.  Ok food if you want a gut bomb.  Especially before a movie.  My daughter loves her meal.
