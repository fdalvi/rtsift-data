1 HORRIBLE!  They lost 3 large pieces of furniture, broke my dining room chairs, and scratched or damaged a number of other items.  The delivery crew was very unprofessional and refused to reassemble my furniture that they had taken apart.  They were late for pick up and delivery and proceeded to charge me significantly more than my original quote.  I have never gotten a straight answer when I have tried calling the office, if they even answered the phone.  I am still waithing for my claims check after 2 months and still getting the run around any time I try to speak to someone.  DO NOT USE EVER!!!
1 These people are liars and will tell you anything to get your buisness. They destroyed a ton of our stuff and never reimbursed us! We filed complaints with the BBB, where they have an F rating already. They still did not reimburse us or apologize. They took a month when they promised a week to deliver our items. The guy even hit on me when picking up our stuff. We saw them drop our boxes and they denied it. Do not use this unprofessional and terrible company.
