4 It's not no 24Hr Fitness nor LVAC, so if that's what your looking for then this is definitely not the gym for you. Snap Fitness is a very small gym to lose some weight or gain some muscles.
1 Waste of money. Only good thing is close to home. Cheaper gyms out there with much more for less.
3 I like this place because I can walk to if  they have better abs machine would be great!
