3 I'm not sure what you can really say about Poundstretchers, but this shop does exactly as it says on the tin.  This particular branch is near my work so I often pop in when I need some batteries, cup a soup, Christmas decorations, anything basically. If I need something I can usually find it here. The staff are always friendly and keen to help.  The shop is spread over two floors. On the ground floor you have toiletries, food and drinks, linen, stationary and kids toys etc. The floor below is the home section; kitchen utensils, lamps, cushions, storage boxes, door stops and everything else for your home you didn't realise you needed.  Obviously the quality of some products isn't fantastic, but the shop doesn't try to be something it isn't. You get what you pay for!
1 I don't like this store. It's grubby inside and the interior fitments look worn out. The staff always look unkempt, trousers hanging off them, belly on show, unbrushed hair and unshaven. That's just the female staff!  Poundstretcher need to get their act together because Poundland is stealing their thunder. What a difference going there. The polar oppositie in presentation compared with Poundstretcher.  Don't get me wrong though because Poundstretcher out of town stores in the retails parks are much, much better than their in town stores which are invariable badly presented. Staff are always genial though, just un-presentable!
