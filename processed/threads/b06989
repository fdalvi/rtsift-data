3 There are better places to see a show in town but the Annex usually doesn't disappoint.  No frills venue that caters to the hard rock crowd, they have an annoying tendency to book "under 21" shows were booze is verboten.  Seriously, what's bar room rock without a bottle of suds?
3 I saw some really great shows here (Brian Jonestown Massacre, DeVotchKa), but the ambience is definitely not what keeps me coming back. Or kept me coming back. The drinks tend to be priced a little high, I think, and the room always seems much smaller than it is.
3 Definitely not the best place in town to see a show, but I have so many fond memories of this place that I can't rightly give it a bad review.  Not the best setup and the drink tend to cost more than seems rational, but it is definitely an intimate venue that usually books a pretty good variety of music.  It seems, though, that they've gone a bit downhill as far as the booking of national acts goes. Actually, they don't seem too big on local acts either. I wonder what happened. Probably just another target of the overzealous ALRC.
3 It is what it is: a small, standing room only rock club. The drinks are overpriced compared to other venues in town.
