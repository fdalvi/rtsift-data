4 +This place is a lot nicer inside than outside.   +Friendly attendant when we were there, and they were able to provide laundry soap when we forgot ours.   +Free Wi-Fi (ask attendant for password)  -A card based system, rather than coin op, so we will probably have money left over on the card, which will almost certainly get lost.   Basically, we only came here to wash our comforters that wouldn't fit in out washer at home. Was a nice surprise to find it clean, well maintained and fairly empty considering it was a Sunday. Primary negative for me is the card based system instead if coin op machines. I understand why it's done, but it's aggravating to have money tied up on a card we will probably not use again for 6 months or more. There are 29 machines, and 26 dryers, and all were working and clean. I imagine it can get pretty crowded and busy during prime laundry hours, but was pretty empty when we came Sunday night around 5pm. Vending machines were pretty bare but there is a market next door and a CVS down the street. Would definitely come back.
5 Super clean inside, all new machines. Free Wi-Fi too! Must buy an in house payment card to use the machines but it eliminates the need to bring quarters. No quarters accepted either, bring cash. Four different size machines and two dryer sizes.
5 Totally modern, all new equipment with lots of small, medium and large commercial front loaders. Pristine and clean. Totally recommend. Oh and free, fast wifi!
