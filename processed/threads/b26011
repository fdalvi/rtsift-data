5 Love this shop! Such friendly service and Kyandy always has an idea when I get stuck on a project.
5 Scrapbook Kyandyland is AWESOME!  I came because of the Graphic 45 stuff I saw on FB. They have soo many scrapbook embellishments. A ton of new papers that I have not seen yet. I asked the lady and she said they get new stuff a least twice a week. TWICE A WEEK! That's great cause the store near me is fine but always has the same stuff.  I think I stayed in the front of the store with the Prima and Kaisercraft at least 30 minutes the first time I came.  I live about 30 minutes away but I've been back twice already.
1 Very rude store owner, called with a question and she told me "I am Closed" - I was calling to get information on the store before I made a 1-hour drive there, hours, etc., she again, rudely says "I said, I am closed!"  Wow, she lives up to the bad reputation given at other scrapping stores crops by customers.  I guess I can take all my scrapbooking business elsewhere.
5 Everything you need is here.  Plus Kyandy is so full of ideas. I just love Scrappin here.
5 this store is chock full of merchandise and great ideas. the owner was helpful she was working on an a layout when I arrived and I loved it so she let me take a picture and explained how to put it together for  later.  she give some great ideas and when I fell in love with a die cut ionly to find it was sold out in the color I wanted she ordered it for me and is having it shipped to my home in Los Angeles area.  that's what I call customer service she knows I won't be a regular cause I am just visiting but she treated me like I would be coming back weekly. I will be returning whenever I in visit vegas about 4 times a year.
