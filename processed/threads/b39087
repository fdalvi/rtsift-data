5 I have used E R Cleaning for two years. They are prompt, very thorough and leave my house spotless. I believe their prices are very reasonable. I have been very satisfied with their service.
5 I have used several cleaning services here in Las Vegas over the last 15 years. Many of them are over priced, do not do a complete job, or the staff are questionable.  I gave ER Cleaning a try and was very impressed! The prices were good and they come with enough people to take care of even larger homes. They also have a truck mounted carpet cleaning service that can quickly clean the carpets for a complete job. Thank you ER Cleaning!
1 We had bought a house and were moving out of a rental that we had lived in for 9 years. The property Managment company told me I had to use this company to clean the house after we moved. I had her come over give me a quote which was $250. I was to meet her and her crew the day they were cleaning at the house. Well I was there early and waited and waited but no show. So I called her to find out what was going on. She tells me she is short staffed and they will be there. Well finally they show up at 3 pm when they were suppose to be there at 11 am. I explained that I could stay any longer and gave her a key to leave on the counter. When I went for the inspection the key was not there, the roach traps that I had purchased as a replacement, a requirement, were gone. The extra paint that was left was gone. Then I get a statement from the property management and she has the nerve to charge me an extra $75 over and above her quote. I have contacted her and told her I want my $75 back which I have not seen yet. I am posting this for consumers to beware of her sneaky ways and I will be contacting the BBB to report this conduct.
