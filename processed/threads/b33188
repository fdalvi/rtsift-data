5 Incredible photography from the dark, to the unexpected, to the most beautiful places on earth, there is a method to this madness. Also featuring talented, diverse paintings and multimedia pieces to tantalize every palate.
5 This is the best place to chill on a Thursday night! Good wine, good people, good art! You can take a spin the in the broken glass photography booth, talk to the resident artists about their work, check out a little 3-D photography or people watch on their big comfy leather couch!
5 A gorgeous space with thought-provoking pieces of photography and art. I love the location, and the installations that have been in this space.  The owner is an amazing man who donates his space to local college students for thesis galleries (he did for me!), and is a very knowledgable, helpful, and fantastic person to talk to.
