1 I went to this place with my wife for an afternoon snack. To summarize everything:  Location: -The place was cold, tables crammed together. -Not very appealing  Food: -The pizzas choices are very limited and you hardly get any toppings -Ordered Margareta pizza (with etra toppings that you have to pay extra for) and they forgot to put on the basil -Pizza tasted very bland  without sufficiently being seasoned, overall, flavorless -A can of pureed tomatoes on your pizza isn't called "sauce"  Price: -Over-priced   Do not recommend this place...
4 Food: had an arugula prosciutto pizza with white sauce. I added caramelized onions which were nicely done. The crust was very good. Apparently they import their flour from Italy. Good flavours over all.My friends were also happy with their pizzas as well.  We shared the dolce banana dessert between 3 people and were very happy.  Service was reasonable.   Location is good but the layout is a little weird. It had similar problems lay out wise as the previous restaurant there.   Child friendly atmosphere. Kids get free gelato with their order.   Moderately priced. Our pizza was about $16  each. I had leftovers to take home. My Italian soda was $3. Dessert was $9 but large enough to share with three adults and a good amount for each of us.
2 Food: - We hade the Verde Neapolitan Pizza with two appetizers. The pizza was a soggy mess; couldn't eat it with your hands or a fork & knife...a spoon might have been the best option. - The flat bread was not bad, but the hummus was a frozen let down. - The olives were a mixed bag, but overall they were my favourite part of the meal.  Service: - The staff was wonderful and generally accommodating. - Unfortunately, the layout of the restaurant is a little strange; you have to fill your own order and wait in line for the tellers to process other customers checking out...felt a little cafeteria-esque and suboptimal.  Set your expectations right and you might enjoy it more than I did. I know some people who love their pizzas soggy, perhaps that's the authentic Neapolitan style, but it's definitely not for me.
2 This place has an identity crisis and needs to decide who it is and fast - cafeteria or full serve ? gourmet or processed fast food pizza ? right now it's using "some" canned ingredients .(pineapple / tomatoes etc.) and "processed" (powdered parmesan etc.) toppings - they are displayed on shelves and I asked about them.  Also, the serving method is just bizarre - why walk your order up to a cashier and don't pay yet - you delivered everything else to my table including food - then... I end up paying at the table anyway ??  Such a nice restaurant and fine staff - decide who you are and pull the trigger - and please lower your prices if not fresh ingredients and sticking with the 1/3 cafeteria style ?? Such potential - a real shame really.
4 Some of these reviews have me shaking my head. Complaining about toppings? Seriously? This isn't a Boston Pizza Pizzaburger. This is Neapolitan pizza. You don't put a meal on your pizza, the pizza is the meal. Honestly, it's like writing a review for a sushi joint and complaining about how they forgot to cook the fish.  That said, this isn't the world's greatest pizza. There are better Neapolitan pizzas in the GTA and, of course, NYC and Europe. That said, to my knowledge the only pizzas in Waterloo Region that come close to Famoso in terms of quality (styles vary quite a bit) are the newly opened Levetto and Casa Rugantino.  It's places like these that are creating a strong group of quality restaurants in Uptown Waterloo.
