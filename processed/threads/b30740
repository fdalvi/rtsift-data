5 this place is amazing. i actually only went there cause i was in need of a haircut and it is right next to my apt. there is a barber in the next building over but they suck...very bad don't go....so i happened on this place.  the interior is very industrial meets sage and chocolate. i loved it. they have a nail tech if you wanna get a manicure. the shampoo they do before the cut is worth it just for that. it lasts a good 15 min with a massage and some very nice smelling shampoo. i was so relaxed after that. Kim was my stylist and she was great. we had a long conversation as she cut my hair.. there is nothing i hate more than some one who is silent as they cut my hair...its uncomfortable. this place makes you feel welcome and invited back for more. the owner was behind the counter when i left and i told her how much i loved it. she said thanks and that she was glad i stopped in. i believe this is my new place for the cuts.
5 I came in here to get a pedicure and it was AMAZING ! It was a waterless pedicure and I was laying down very different from any other pedicure I had before . For the first time I felt that I got my money's worth, Ivon has an awesome personality took her time with me and was very detailed with the service. I will definitely be back to try other service they offer there waxing and facials as well as hair care services . I guarantee you will feel the same way .
5 This salon is great and the stylist there are so friendly.  I go here regularly for my pedicures.  You'll never go back to the chop shop type pedicures once your feet have felt the hands of Ivon.  My husband gets his haircut here as well and he loves it.  Great location for us too.
