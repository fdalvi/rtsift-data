5 Dr. Bachenheimer is amazing. She is very knowledgeable and attends medical conferences regularly to stay 'in the know' with advances in the field. She is very personable and easy to talk to. I moved to Scottsdale over a year ago and needed to find general practitioner. My boss's wife is in medical supply sales and referred me to Dr. Bachenheimer. I couldn't be more satisfied with a doctor.   She can always fit you in, just in case you do get sick :) Call first thing in the morning and she adjusts her schedule to make sure she can get you better quicker.
1 Dr Bachenheimer is awesome. She is compassionate and kind and on the cutting edge of medical knowledge. Unfortunately, I will never go back to her practice because of her front office person, Carrie. Carrie is rude, interrupts you when you speak is confrontational and completely difficult and infuriating to deal with. I have never been treated as badly as I have by Carrie.
1 Dr. Bochenheimer is the Worst!!! She refused to see my elderly mother who was 7 minutes late for her appointment. She has the bedside manner of a truck driver. Will never go back and have seen many, many complaints such as ours. How this lady stays in business, is beyond me. Avoid this doctor
1 Refused to help the one time I asked her to send a prescription for an antibiotic when I was out of town and couldn't get to a medical facility.  It was for a jaw infection that I had experienced before and she treated with the antibiotic.  I had the same symptoms and asked her to send a prescription to a local pharmacy in this very small town, 500 miles from Scottsdale.  She refused. She said she would not prescribe any meds unless she saw me in the office. Baloney.  She just wanted the money for the office visit and could care less about my problem.  She is no longer my internist.
