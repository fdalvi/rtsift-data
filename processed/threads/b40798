5 Musicology has been instrumental in my daughter's development since she was 6 months old. She loves the music and activities. The instructors are knowledgeable in early childhood education and have a wonderful, happy demeanor. We have incorporated several music toys at home that she fell in love with at Musicology. We also use one of the "pick up the instruments" songs when we pick up our toys at home.   One thing to know - the parents are expected to actively participate in the classes with their children. It's not social hour for the moms, and I think that is super cool.   Worth the investment to participate in a fun, parent-child activity with instructors who know their stuff.
5 Musicology is a special place to take your little ones. Knowledgable and personable staff who genuinely care about your child's learning! As a parent you also get to remember what it's like to be a kid again... and even show it which makes it one of the top programs in Arizona!!
