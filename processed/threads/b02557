5 Scott is the owner and the only one who cleans the carpets. This is why he has the same customers for YEARS! He is so trustworthy that lots of his customers, including us, leave him the key to take care of the carpets when they're gone. He has been our only carpet man since the mid- 90's and took care of our restaurant carpet for its 15 years. One interesting thing that many don't know about him is that he can do "carpet art" with the carpet cleaning wand, which is especially loved in the kids' rooms. I have referred lots of people to him and everyone has been thoroughly satisfied. Mister Carpet really is as good as it gets!
5 I learned of Scott through a flyer and he has come by a few times over the years.  He is down to earth, and friendly enough that, yesterday, when my 3 year old son smeared an entire tub of Desitin over his new carpet, I called Scott in a panic to see if he had any advice on how to attack the problem.  Note, I did not ask him to come over, but as if in a dream, 15 minutes later, he was ringing the doorbell.  Turned out he was in the neighborhood and he came by to tackle the challenge (because he actually likes challenges).  He not only cleaned the rug, but attacked the chair and a few of the stuffed animals too!  Thorough, good, and cool.  Couldn;t recommend anyone more.
