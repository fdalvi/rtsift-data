4 Split over five levels, the City Art Centre hosts regularly changing exhibitions spanning a very diverse range of themes.    To give you a flavour, my last visit included a superb and fascinating exhibition on the real-world applications of Drawing, a celebration of Ancient Historical Monuments in Scotland and an exploration of Space Age-themed design.    Over several visits I've always been impressed with the quality of the exhibitions, which have been interesting and very well thought out, researched and presented - often with some interactive elements as well.    Well worth a trip, especially as a lot of the exhibitions are free to visit.
4 I discovered this cafe on a Sunday afternoon after a liesurely wander round Arthur's seat, and enroute to Waverly station. With about 20 minutes to kill before my friend's train left the platform, we went in search of a independent coffee store to savour a good coffee, and this is what we found.    The City Art Centre Cafe has an elegant (but not fine dining!) look. White, wooden tables and well dressed staff. There is table service, which is rather refreshing for a cafe, plenty of lovely looking cakes on the cake stands, and a delicious sounding lunch menu. It may sound a bit poncey, but it doesn't feel that way.    The coffee (a flat white of course) was slightly burnt, but good temperature, and well made. And the bonus, it's Artisan Roast coffee! I won't go out of my way to come back time after time here, but it will definitely be my default choice while waiting for a train -- the coffee here is miles better than anything else nearby... and the market street entrance to the train station is directly across the road.    £1.90 for a coffee (good price for an Artisan Roast brew!) £1.75 for a slice of Millionaire's shortcake.    Give it a go!
