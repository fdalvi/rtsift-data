5 I'm afraid I'm turning into that old guy who finds a style of shoes he likes as a teen and never stops wearing them.  Thankfully Vans don't seem to go out of style and they do add some new flavors in from time to time so I may be okay.  I've been to Vans stores in many states and the one in Scottsdale Fashion Square is my favorite.  I never feel like I'm looked down on because I'm not some teen or hipster (I'm not a hipster!).    It never seems to matter how much you're spending here to get great service.  Even before I walked out with my five new pairs of shoes they treated me like I was going to buy five new pair.    This reminds me, is there some sort of 12 step for shoe addiction?
4 Employees are nice but some of them can be rude. The Semi-Annual sale was not that big here which I was disappointed about. Store is a pretty good size but I wish they had more cash registers since lines can be long here. The dressing rooms are hidden which is weird and almost makes you think like they don't have any dressing rooms.
5 I mostly come here because my husband is obsessed with red Vans. I have to say that every time I do I am always greeted and offered assistance.  I once even found a pair I like, which I will admit has quickly become my favorite pair of shoes.   This store carries a variety of new styles as well as old classics that never go out of style. I also like a variety of their clothing and is the best place to find my socks. This store is always worth driving the extra miles.
