5 These make really great gifts.  If you know anyone from the Arizona area, ZonieBaskets will hook you up with an awesome custom gift basket filled with local food favorites from AZ!  Definitely these people know what they're doing...  The ordering process was seemless and the product totally unique.  Someone should do this for bay area products...
5 What a great gift idea ... a basket full of products made in Arizona! I purchased a gift basket for a friend yesterday and it was delivered today. Actually, hand delivered by the owner. Now that's great service (granted my friend lives in the same area)! My friend called me right away to say how much she loved all the goodies. I'm sure I'll be purchasing more from ZonieBaskets.
5 I love Zonie Baskets! I ordered something for my dad for father's day and had it shipped to Wisconsin. The owner also threw in a free gift!
