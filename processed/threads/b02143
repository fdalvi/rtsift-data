4 I never like to rate a Doc on the first visit.  So I've been here a few times and I have to say that I really like this Dr. Office.  Paul Strauss is the one I see and he's a great doc.  More importantly - they have a very competent staff of nurses and assistants.
5 I've been back a few times now and I really like Dr. Paul and his staff.  They are top notch heath care providers and they are real people who know how to balance health care with your busy life.  Entire office has a GREAT sense of humor too!
1 So this clinic used to have a great lead doctor and was run well.  But sadly the staff has become very condescending and the clinic is no longer well run now that Dr. Levins has taken over.  I had a billing issue and the staff would not answer any of my questions nor provide me with copies of paperwork I requested so I could understand what was going on with my bill.  They coded my visit incorrectly and would not correct the issue causing an overbilling.  What was really disappointing was the front desk staff was soooo condescending when questioned.  Love Dr. Sargent but not worth the incorrect handling of my information nor the attitude from the desk staff.
