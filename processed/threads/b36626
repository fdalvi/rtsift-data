5 James Lee is an awesome dance instructor, especially if you have 2 left feet!  My husband and I contacted him due to his business location close to our house prior to our wedding, we were worried about looking like fools during the 'first dance'.  At his suggestion we sent him 2 songs we were considering and James Lee worked out a routine for our favorite one.    For 3 nights a week, for 4 weeks, we met with James Lee and danced our buns off in his private studio, located in a residential neighborhood.  He is extremely patient and walked us through the same routines over and over until we got it down.  My husband is a mechanic and no one would ever mistake him as graceful, however James Lee took us from simple steps to a full, choreographed routine.  Nothing over the top (major cheese factor!) but enough so we didnt look like two dummies out there on the dance floor.    I tell everyone now if you are having relationship problems to consider formal dance lessons!  It takes a lot of work to function together as a team and make it look like you are having fun, and the right dance instructor makes a big difference when it comes to mediation time :-)  A++ highly recommend James Lee Makepeace @ U B Dancin.
5 I have been taking lessons from James Lee for several months.  I continually want to return to learn more.  He's very patient, uses great music, and is quite professional.  I have had dance lessons from all sorts of instructors, so I think my observations come with good insight and perspective.  If you are looking for private instruction, I highly recommend that you call James Lee!
5 James is the most professional and knowledgeable dance instructor we've had in 3 years. We are experienced dancers, however we have created our own shortcuts, etc. James has trained and critiqued them out of our muscle memory. I personally enjoy going to a lesson every week, I feel that I've improved dramatically and will continue to take lessons from James.
