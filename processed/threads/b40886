5 Wendy has been doing my family pictures for years she captures such perfect memories. My 5 year old has had her picture done every year of her little life by miss wendy! Such an amazing photographer !
5 Words can not express my experience with Wendy. She has done my Graduation photos and both my engagement photos as well as my full wedding.   She treated us with the utmost respect. She came prepared and she did something I hadn't seen from any other photographer... She caught so many precious candid photographs that, as the bride, I would have never been able to see.  My family absolutely adores her. They kept saying how patient, and kind she was. That she wasn't pushy like other photogs... They were right, the experience I had will keep me a returning customer.   She knows exactly what it takes to get the shot and capture the memories. As an Art major, I really enjoy the artistry that comes out of her photos.  I can go on forever... She's great!
5 I live in Tulsa, Oklahoma & was in Las Vegas to celebrate my 50th & my daughters' 21st birthdays. I wanted to capture some memories of our 'Girls Weekend'. I found Wendy from her Facebook page. I loved her photos & the original fun poses she captured that were on her page. We began communicating & we set up up the photo shoot for the week we were there.  I'm SO glad I chose her! She came to our hotel (Paris on the Strip). She took many many photos of us in the hotel, outdoors, etc. Very original poses! We were so comfortable with her. She was so nice & professional.  For a set price (very reasonable) she edited all the pictures & mailed me the CD with ALL the photos on it, which I received just a few days after we got home. The memories she captured of my daughter & I were SO awesome. They are memories I will treasure forever!  Next time I'm in Las Vegas I plan to set up another session with her. She's definitely gifted in photography! Thank you Wendy!!
