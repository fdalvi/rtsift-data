4 I couldn't believe Blueberry Hill wasn't on Yelp. Maybe its because it caters for a breakfast/lunch crowd, but I love this little local gem and its an escape when working from home :-)  Its small (about 5 tables that seat between 2 and 4 at each) but very popular with locals of all ages and can fill up very quickly as people pile in.   Does the usual cafe food: sandwiches (my fav is chicken, chorizo & lime pickle on brown gf bread but my mum swears by the roast beef which is cooked in-house) as well as soups and baked potatoes.   Specials change constantly and today included chowder, baked trout and quorn chilli. Cakes are homemade and cover everything from tray bakes to cheesecake.  This place is a gem - cheap but excellent fresh food - 4 stars, but only because I've not had cake yet...
5 Great little cafe on the west side of the city.  It is small, but welcoming and is fantastic for lunch with children and families.  There is a great sense of community when you enter this coffee shop: walls are covered with drawn pictures by kids, and opposite there are information posters about what's going on in the area.  Staff are attentive and there is a very relaxed feel throughout the establishment. One down side is that there is no WiFi availability but you don't need the Internet while you're tucking into their tasty home made food.   The cafe is inexpensive, sandwich fillings are generous and cakes are delicious too.
