5 All I need to say is Happy Hour/Snack Bar.  4PM-Close (Monday through Saturday, all day Sunday).  That's about the happiest happy hour I've seen in a while.  Beer was 1/2 price. The "Snack Bar" consists of a list of bar favorites for $2.99.  The portions are small, but just enough food to keep you going and not ruin your buzz.  I don't find myself on this side of town very often, but when I do this is a good place to get the night started!
5 I can confirm, best happy hour in the land.  Cool bartenders.  Cozy little bar area.  Tasty happy hour menu.  Parking sucks after 6pm on weekend nights though, just a heads up.

Waiter: Yes, how can I help you?  Me: "Yea, there is Half of a tomato in my pizza."  Waiter: "Yea..."  Me: "I don't think you understand... there is half of a tomato in my pizza. Like, someone took a whole tomato, chopped it in half, put half of it on pizza dough, covered it with cheese, and then put it on this plate."  Waiter: "Yes, you ordered the pizza"  Me: "Yes. Dough, Sauce, Cheese"  Waiter: "Well thats our sauce. its tomato"  Me: "No. pizzas have Tomato sauce. its made from Tomato. it isnt just Tomato. Thats like if i went to a fast food resturant, ordered fries, asked for ketchup and the guy behind the counter just handed me a tomato. I mean come on.   Waiter: "Umm...."  Me: "Listen, can i just get a pizza with pizza sauce?"  Waiter: "I'm sorry, this is what we serve at Uno's."  Me: "Wow... this is lame..."
