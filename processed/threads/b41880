3 So they are brand new and clearly unsure of what they are doing. No big deal they were friendly and trying to do the best they could. I ordered the buffalo chicken pita and had it customized because I didn't care of some of the suggested ingredients. The buffalo sauce has a hint of BBQ sauce taste and I hate the taste of BBQ. I ate about a quarter of it and had to be done. I got the berry berry smoothie which was delicious so I at least have that. I will try again just maybe something different next time.
5 This is the best pita I have ever had!  The staff is friendly and the food is delicious.    Wish I could eat there every day.
5 So happy a healthy food alternative replaced a Cold Stone Creamery!!  I tried this place for the first time a couple weeks ago when they just opened. Great friendly staff and great menu selections. I had the Local Pita - delish!  Very happy there is a quick healthy to go food place close to home!!
1 I was excited to have a pita shop so close to home, however watching the cook heat up pre-cooked meat was not what I expected.   Watched the cook open the drawer under the cook top to retrieve the pre-cooked meat and then slam the drawer with his foot numerous times.  The chicken pita that I received tasted like pre-cooked boiled chicken.  For the price, I expected way more.  Wont be returning.
