3 nothing special on the menu. ive had the Pizza, and their Chicken Breast Hero. and both were just average.
5 Okay, just one quick word about Minutos deli...FABULOUS!!!   I used to always go here before joining the Navy, Their sandwiches are the best ever. I only go now when I visit my Dad in Las Vegas. I love the taste of their sandwiches so much, the service is awesome too. Give this place a try at least once, you will not be disappointed. This place is one of only 2 places in the Smith's shopping center that have been there for more than a couple years, Smiths is the other one.  Their food is so yummy and authentic. Minutos rocks, eat here soon. I have never eaten the pizza here but I am just so stuck on their subs :) But hey, I can reccomend the subs :)
5 My husband won a certificate from a radio station to this authentic italian deli- what a gem! Located in the Smith's strip mall, you wouldn't think that this place existed. We've ranted and raved about this place to family (my husband's half Italian.) We keep saying that we'll be back- maybe sometime in the near future.   Very impressed. We had the sub sandwiches, which were really good. The prices were pretty good. The atmosphere is cute- meats hanging. Small tables & booth seating available.
4 Now named La Duca's Italian Deli this place has great sandwiches.   I tried the Italian Hero which had Prosciutto, cappocolla, mortadella and salami, provolone lettuce, tomato, onion and dressing. The sandwich was delicious, the bread is baked in house and you can taste the freshness. All the eats combined with condiments gave the sandwich a yummy flavor.  I would highly recomend La Duca's for a sandwich and will be back again.
