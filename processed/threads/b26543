1 What a joke! This is, by far, the most expensive Halloween store in town. These guys are actually more than double what the other Halloween place is. Last year I paid $60 for a prop that these clowns are selling for $129. RIP OFF!!! Then my son wanted me to take a picture of him wearing a mask and some teenager came and told me that I'm not allowed to take pictures in their store. Seriously? Anyway, save yourself some money...lots of money...by shopping around. You can get the same stuff for half the price.
2 The countdown has begun. Halloween is just around the corner and the perfect costume has yet to be obtained. Scouring the thrift stores has proved to be fruitless, so a trip to an actual Halloween retail shop was in order. Too bad Halloween Express does not have much of a selection in men's costumes. Besides the generic gladiator, pirate, or ridiculously raunchy, there was nothing else.   The selections on superhero costumes was rather pathetic even with the popularity of Batman and the Avengers. I found more options at one of the thrift stores I stopped by afterwards.
4 Was in the area so we stopped in.  There seemed to be a good varity to choose from.  I was only in there for less than 10 min but two different employees approached me to see if I needed help. Didn't look at prices so no sure if they where overly expensive as another yelper noted.
