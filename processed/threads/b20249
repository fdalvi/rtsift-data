4 Hadn't been here for some time and never before for an evening meal but the Dine Around Edinburgh menu (3 courses, Â£15) was tempting so 4 of us elected to go.    The decor has changed from blue and white based to a warmer, autumnal palette and this gives the place a cosier atmosphere as you'd expect. Our waitress was very pleasant and the food was of the quality I've come to expect based on the lunches I've previously eaten here. Definitely an establishment still punching its weight.
4 I eat at Blue quite often. It is, without doubt, a tip-top mid-range restaurant. The staff are always a joy, patient and polite, even when under pressure or subject to provocation (not from me, of course).
