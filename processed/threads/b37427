5 i highly recommend a touch of grace event planning co. the coordinator who worked with us was very professional and responsive, her name is Kahea. she made our sons wedding run so  smoothly, i didnt have to tell her what and when to do a thing she was on top of it all, from the day before at the rehearsal dinner, coordinating the photographer, to the ceremony, reception! she was awesome, i didnt have to do a thing!! i said it already but i highly recommend Kahea at a touch of grace!!!
5 My sister got married a few months ago, and I was the maid-of-honor at the wedding. Although I tried not to be stressed at the prospect of being my sister's maid-of-honor, my excitement was tinged with a bit of anxiety when she asked me to fill that role in her wedding. I love my sister-- she deserves only the best so I definitely wanted to help make her wedding planning process easier and stress-free. However, as the months went by, my sister never seemed stressed, but only more excited. I was left to plan one of the best parts of the weddings-- the bachelorette party! It didn't really occur to me during those months that the reason my sister was so stress-free (and myself) was because Kahea with A Touch of Grace was helping my sister with everything. And when the wedding day came, it was absolutely beautiful!! I love A Touch of Grace for a myriad of reasons-- they understand the importance of a bride's wedding day, whether it's a small, intimate day or a large, grand event. Kahea, as well as the other coordinators, are passionate and love what they do. They instantly make you feel comfortable, are so professional yet personal-- and they work so hard! Kahea is wonderful, and she made my sisters wedding day so special-- for her and her husband as well as their families. We couldn't have enjoyed the day and the wedding planning process like we did without Kahea and A Touch of Grace! I would recommend her to anyone!
