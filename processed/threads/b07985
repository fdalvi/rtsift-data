5 I always thought Bingo was for old people, and then I went to Reflections Bingo Hall and was immediately hooked!  The first time I went I won 1k on my second game, and my friend that went with me won $500 on her 6th game!  Since then we have continued to play and have continued to win!  Some may say that Bingo is boring or does not provoke enough action, but I love it!  This place serves your tradition fried selection of food, which is okay to snack on while you're gaming, but overall makes the place stink like old grease.  There is a smoking room in the back that is closed off, and every once in a while you can hear someone from there faintly yell "BINGO!"  If it is your first time going you get to pick out a free dabber.  The staff is friendly and humorous, and I seem to have good luck on the game when I chat with Danny.  The only thing I do NOT recommend playing is their game that starts at 10 pm.  I cannot remember the name of it, but I blew through 20 bucks in 30 minutes.  It was not fun.
4 FUN FUN & more FUN!  My friends and I are so hooked!  Great crowd and fun loving staff!  Check out their FB page for the current months schedule and specials!  Main room is non-smoking which is nice but they do also have a smoking room.
