1 Worst pawn shop ever! Old guy with the beard accused me of taking pictures of silver coins when I was using my phone. $4000 in my pocket and none for you. Don't waste your time going there you will be sorry
5 HOLY MOLY ITS RAINING HOT MENS AROUND HAIRRE--- and some old TeleVs' you can make it easy to this place because they have bus stop in front. they will accept unmentionables but they dont accept all gently used clothing. Joe B will pick you up from the front- use him
1 An absolute joke. The amount of attitude you get for trying to sell or pawn something is ridiculous. Not to mention that the selection in the store is garbage.
1 I came in here around 1230 and I was looking at a Silver Eagle.  The e owner quoted me over double the silver value for it and when I asked if he could drop the price he got rude and started saying to get out of the store. I've never encountered such a rude store owner and I for sure will never go back
