4 I've been a Wells Fargo customer ever since. And this place has been my go-to bank because it's close to my house.  One thing i like about this location, is that they have a very friendly staff. Their front desk associates are so friendly and accommodating. Every time i step my foot on this bank, i'm always greeted with a smile! Parking is not that bad. There are more parking spaces at the back space of the bank. There's also a Walgreens and a lot more stores nearby.  Mind you, when it gets busy, it gets a lil uncomfortable too. Let's say i go here regularly and when it's busy, most of the customers are men. One time, i was wearing a cardigan and a long distressed shorts. It wasn't revealing at all! I look at them, and i feel like they were all mentally undressing me! Is it because of the holes on the knees of my shorts? LOL how uncomfortable that could be!
1 Horrible service and you will stand in line for hours for a simple transaction. The manager is rude and doesn't seem to ever be busy but you will wait while one worker bee handles all of the transactions.
1 3 months ago my score would have been much different. Now it is apparent to me as long as you deposit your money and go on your way, all is good. It's only when you need help that the bank begins finger pointing. Horrible customer service....avoid at all costs!
1 Very dangerous to use ATM at night!  It's located  on the back of the building with a brick wall  on your right, completely hiding from view.  Safer to drive to the one on Las Vegas Blvd and Clark, very open and lit up like the 4th of July.
