1 This place does not turn on there ac...  Leaves the door wide open so a bunch of flies come in...  On a side note mothers bring there kids in so if you are looking for a nice relaxing experience I would go else where.
5 Love this place, they are interactive, and actually talk to you when they are working on your nails. They can do everything, including awesome art work, and the best part, they don't chatter back and forth in their own language like other places. Prices are way cheaper than other salons, especially for the quality of work. I've tried several salons in the area, and sunrise is by far the absolute best!!!!!  Will always come back here.
4 I always come here to get my eyebrows and upper lip waxed. They always do it perfectly. It's $12 for both, but if you want your upper lip done by itself it is $5. Eyebrows is $8. Anyways... This place is always busy so they must be doing something right, right? This morning I came in to take my little sister's friend to get a pedicure and I'd have to say I was satisfied. Well, for the most part. The price for a regular pedicure is $17. She got a regular pedicure and a design on each of her big toe. The reason I am giving this place 4 stars is because when the lady was finished with her nails she just took off. We waited for like 10 minutes hoping she would come back, but I guess she didn't. We had to ask for somebody's assistance so we can pay. They really should have someone at the front desk because I really am an impatient person. Overall though, this place is great and if you're looking to get your nails done or get waxed, this is the one!
