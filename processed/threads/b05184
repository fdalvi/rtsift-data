4 I am amazed at how much food they give you for $5.  There are six specials and I ordered the one with a slice of pizza, small salad and soda.  I also ordered garlic knots and I think the guy gave them to me for free, since the bill was $5.24.    The food was good... the pizza had a crisp thin crust and it had a good amount of sauce and cheese.  I am still thinking about the delicious garlic knots... WOW.  The doughy pieces are soaked in butter and then sprinkled with garlic and parm cheese.  They even give you a cup of marinara.    I totally recommend this place!
5 For an outstanding value - - here's a hidden gem in Henderson Nevada (just south of Las vegas)  Vito's recently relocated to 2525 W. Horizon Ridge Parkway (just east of Eastern Avenue) in Henderson NV 89052.    They are open from 11:00AM to 9:00PM Mon - Thur; 11:00AM to 10:00PM Fri - Sat; and 12:00AM to 9:00PM on Sunday.   They provide eat-in, take-out and free delivery.   Their phone number is:  (702) 269-6895.   The food is great and they sell pizza by the slice, including the best New York style pizza in the Las Vegas area.  Their menu includes  more than just pizza; as they also serve incredible pasta, entr√©es, salad, sandwiches & desserts.  (I really loved their meatball sub and antipasta salad, my daughter loves their pasta, and my buddy from upstate New York raves about their pizza.)  The prices are extremely reasonable and the service is simply outstanding.  One of the best values for eating out around the area...   Their menu can be found online at:   http://www.vitospizzalv.com   The atmosphere is very inviting, the restaurant is very clean, and the bathrooms were immaculate.   (I always pay attention to how well the bathrooms are maintained--as this is a signal about how clean & well managed the rest of the restaurant is).  I really like to stop in to eat & watch football games on their large screen TV!        The manager who stopped by my table wanted to ensure the food & service met our expectations.  I was totally impressed when he shared that while he likes to hear compliments, he really wants to know if something needs to be improved or corrected (so that they  might fix things they otherwise are unaware of).  Ask for Tommy if you have any comments  There is no better local value for the money!
4 For value and variety I have found no better italian/pizza delivery place in Vegas! For a mere $24 we got the following delivered to our door:  *($2) Garden salad  - while cheap it was nothing special. You get what you pay for ! *($2.95) 1/2 dozen wings (medium). YUM. Again not best wings ever, but definitely sufficed. Cheap and spicy! We'll be getting mild next time. *($6.95) Cheese ravioli *various slices of pizza. The pizza is $1.75 a slice. Very reasonable and allowed us to try lots of different kinds. I was disappointed by the sicilian (I was hoping for a little thicker crust), but the NY style was fabulous.  *Garlic knots ($1 per order of 3). Tasty but I think they needed a little more butter. MB I'm just a fat-ass though.. lol.. they were definitely garlicy enough!  Overall my major disappointment was the food was only luke-warm on arrival and had to be shoved in the microwave. I live literally 2 miles away so I didn't expect there to be issues with it cooling off too much in transit. Overall the value is great and the food is good. Highlight was the NY style pizza. I love the variety the menu offers.
