1 Beware of any warranty. They will change the rules and not honor a lifetime warranty. Very poor business practice.
1 My pool pump broke so I had them come out and install a new one which they couldn't do for like a week.  Then the tech shows up at night when it is pitch black, installs our pump by the light of his cell phone and then I find out my pump is leaking three days later.  Then they have the audacity to tell me they won't come out again for another week or so to fix it.   STAY CLEAR OF SHASTA!!
