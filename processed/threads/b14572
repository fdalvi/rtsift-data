2 I have been taking my pet to Agua Fria Animal Clinic for about 3 years out of pure convenience.  The staff is very nice but I feel they are a bit overpriced. I have run in to 2 situations where they quote me a price and then my ending bill turns out to be quite a bit more.  I also heard someone else with the same problem while I was in the waiting room.  A lot of tack on fees after the fact.  I like the Vet but I will probably change simply due to pricing.
5 This Clinic is now owned by new Vets. They are great and friendly and very knowledgeable.   I brought Guinea Pigs to Dr. Dostera dozen years ago and a year ago my dog to Dr. Jack. I liked both guys fine and did not find them over priced. They have both retired.    I was very afraid with the new staff the prices would sky rocket. They have not. I had a Husky injured this past January and the fee to knock her out and sew her up was under 500. That included all her take home medications and follow visits. Today I took my 8 year old lap dog into the clinic on short notice with what I thought was a UTI. It turned out to be an infected uterus... really involved. She had to have it removed asap and they included a teeth cleaning and one extraction for half price because she was already going to be knocked out. They also discounted the ultrasound after X rays were taken. The price was around 1000. but will include all the follow up visits and take home medication.  I love that they are close to home and I trust this clinic with my animals. I will recommend them to you for sure.
5 I highly recommend this clinic and have referred friends who thanked me for telling them about it.  Dr. Duston is awesome and very compassionate.  All the staff is very thorough and knowledgeable and considerate.  Their charges are very reasonable and much better than elsewhere.  I feel we are getting exceptional care and grateful my daughter referred me when I moved here from California.  Thank you Dr. Duston!
