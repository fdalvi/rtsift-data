5 I have sent several clients to Louis as he helped them avoid BK. His out of the box thinking was amazing and I am happy to refer him business. I love that he explains to people that they should buy life insurance because their family needs it and that money can not be dispursed to creditors. He also works with amazing power partners that make him look good and help his clients.
5 Louis Parker is an outstanding bankruptcy attorney.  I sat down with him one day when I was considering bankruptcy and his insights and suggestions prompted me to research my debt issue more thoroughly.  I discovered that a slightly higher payment towards my debt could eliminate it within 3 years.  I happily drove from Mesa to his Phoenix office to speak with him, but would have driven from Chandler, Tempe or Scottsdale as well.  He is genuinely interested in the best options for his clients rather than suggesting bankruptcy to all in order to boost his fees.  I highly recommend Louis to anyone who is or may be considering bankruptcy.
5 I have referred numerous clients to Jared Bennett, he is knowledgable and experienced bankruptcy attorney.
