5 Thank You! Thank You! Thank You! I just got my car back and it looks fantastic. The ability to see the status of my repairs online was a huge plus. Your staff was friendly and professional. I hope I never need that type of service again, but if I do, I will definitely bring back to you.
5 Mr. Jimmy Lee, the owner, will take great care of you and your car. I've used his services after my insurance agent sent me to him. I then took my fiance's car there to have a repair made. When we returned to pick the car up, not only was it washed, the interior had also been vacuumed.  If you are looking for affordable, friendly, efficient, trustworthy service, then International Auto Painting and Body with Mr. Lee is where you must go.
5 I have unfortunately had to had several cars repaired...lets say because of someone else's careless driving. Every time, I take my cars to International. I had great service, and quick turnaround. Thank guys.....I will hate to have to use you again.....but I'm sure it's only a matter of time.
