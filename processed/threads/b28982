5 took the ole beater in with a leaking transmission. This place is great, the manager was very nice, and helpful, the other workers were great. they didn't try to up sell me, or try to get me have things i didn't need done. if you need trans work , run to this place. no pressure here. 2 thumbs up.
4 I took my vehicle here early this month for what I assumed would be a massive overhaul to my transmission. I dropped my vehicle off after a quick test drive and they got back to me with an estimate the following afternoon. Overall I was very surprised with how quick the estimate and repairs went. It took about a day or two (closed on the weekend) to repair. The overhaul consisted of a master rebuild, a drive shaft replacement, and replacement of the yokes.  The most important thing is I received a fast and honest quote. For the amount of work I had done I believe I paid a good price. The quickness of service was also a plus.  Things to note:  They (like normal people) eat lunch. The couple times I stopped in I waited around for them to get back. So Id show up before 11 and after 1230.  Their work is warranted. This was a big deal for me. All my work is covered by a 2 year / 24k mile warranty. My repairs went fantastic but my engine light came back on so I may need to bring mine back. Either way i'm content with the work.  Overall, I am satisfied. If you are looking for good honest transmission work in the east valley, Dougs is for you.
5 Honest, friendly, trustworthy mechanics! I've used Doug's Performance Transmission for years and wouldn't trust anyone else to work on my vehicle.
