4 Small cafe admist all the highrises in Uptown. Good selection of food for breakfast, lunch, and snacks. The service is super friendly too. They've got other things you may need in the office if you forgot something at home.   The 4 stars for me came from the Watermelon Nectar though. It is incredibly refreshing on a hot day. It's watermelon juice, coconut water, mint, and nectar. Also, checking in will get you a free scope of ice cream which I'm always a fan of. They had a good selection of ice cream to choose from too so it actually made for a tough decision.
5 I work just above this cafe. This a quick place to grab lunch or breakfast for a reasonable price. Daily lunch specials a plus! Wes and his crew are all very nice people. Try the honey badger wrap if it happens to be on the special menu. It is very tasty!
