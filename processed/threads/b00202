1 I used this place once, and it will be my last. The place reeked of old urine. I'm not sure if someone has used it as a bathroom, and the place never got cleaned, or what? All I know is that it stinks, and not a good smell at that.
5 This laundry mat is small but tidy and is never over-crowded. The owners are punctual, professional and I see them just about every time I do laundry, cleaning up and providing maintenance if needed. Some places you just can't beat; this is one of them. :-)
