4 Large bar with lots of room, plenty of pool tables, darts, etc. etc. Not very crowded, so its a great place to hang out with friends and relax, shoot a game of pool, or watch bands on Fridays & Saturday nights.
4 Stopped in there December 17th. They have a great sound system that fills this large bar up nicely.  I got the sampler platter and it's all fried, and it was definitely edible, I was wanting more! Lot's of beers on tap. Chuck the owner is very nice and easy to talk to and always has a grin.  Julie is a hard worker and keeps the beers flowing, take of the wait staff and they will take care of you.  Oh they had a live band there, Whiskey Tango was the name of the band.  I left there with money in my pocket, this place will not break you, it's a working mans bar. I will definitely go back there!!!
4 This neighborhood hangout is under new management and has undergone all the right things to make it a fun respite from the outside world. Give it a try, you'll like it.
4 Good food, friendly service, and a clean house. The menu is simple, but perfect for a quick lunch.
4 Had a great time here on a Friday night.  Played Songo, which was this really fun bingo game with sons!  It was such a fun time.  We decided to order food and the Tuna sandwhich was so unexpectadly delicous!  I was very pleased.
4 Nice, cold, a/c, dim lighting, comfy... plus, they had Widmer Hefeweizen on draft for $2! The hot-honey wings are out of this world and the service is friendly.
4 Tasty food, friendly service
3 I used to go to Pappy's every week, and sometimes twice a week, for karaoke and friendly atmosphere.  Last time I checked, they only have karaoke on Thursday nights. Like it better when they had it early (started 7 pm) on Sunday evenings.  They are under new management now, and I've heard they've spiffed the place up. Maybe I'll go  back again, maybe not.
5 Pappy's is great! The people, the vibe, the service and food are all fantastic for a bar. Heading there in a few mins!
