3 I'm a fan of Sally's, love their designer knock off  hair products (Beyond the Zone and So Gorgeous). I also love the tons of perfectly organized nail products and polishes. This Sally's has a great staff and they are always very helpful, not the most hair educated, but definitely opinionated .   They do not carry fake hair pieces or extensions, which was a big disappointment (go to the one on 16th st and Camelback for that).  This Sally's is a cleptos dream. Every time I go in there I see teenagers OBVIOUSLY stealing crap. I never tell, but I am always tempted too.. I mean really stealing a $2 nail file.. Sheesh.
3 -Friendly cashier, maybe they could use an extra person on duty.  -Parking was ok, but some jerk parked so damn close to my car, I had to get in through the passenger side.   -I saw a few hobos in the desolate parking lot and a crazy woman cut in line at Sallys and paid with bags of coins...I sure wasn't going to say anything. YIKES!
3 Came into the store and wasn't really helped out much. I knew exactly what I was getting, so it wasn't that hard. Purple shampoo, for those blondes out there, really keeps the brass away. I would totally recommend Clairol "Shimmer Lights" if you have blonde or silver strands.  Anyway, there was only one person working, she didn't seem totally enthused to be there, but it was quick -- except for dialing in the sally's card. For some reason, employees have to dial in some hotline on a phone, and the register sounds like 1999 AOL Dialup, which is weird, but aside from that, great place to get girly hair crap. My fav.
