5 As an avid juicer and juice drinker, I'm usually left unimpressed with the creativity factor at most juice bars. Not here! I picked up an 8oz. juice called the "Flu Shot" from Jessie, who was super friendly and helpful. (see pictures for the ingredients) She told me it was delicious but potent, and she was right on! First order of business when I get home will be recreating this work of juice art! :) They also have an assortment of fresh/raw/vegan granola, breakfast cereals, and desserts. I'll definitely visit again!
5 I try to keep up with drinking raw juices when I travel so this place is perfect for me, a little on the pricey side.  However, both the Keri drink and Quinoa salad were very good.  I especially liked the dressing- that's a winner.   I'll be back to try other juices during my travels to AZ in the next few weeks.
5 It was good! I went last week for lunch and had the burrito, and it was delicious. I also had a juice which was delish as well. Today I went and had the Strawberry Warrior for breakfast. It was good, nothing out of this world amazing but it was good. I love the organic and non-GMO deal and I love the vegan foods. The only thing that kept me from going more was having to pay for parking but today I found out they validate parking tickets. Seriously! I've been paying this whole time, LOL!!!
