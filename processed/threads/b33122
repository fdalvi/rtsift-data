3 The service was very friendly, fast service the place wasn't too packed as I stopped by around 11am. The pupusas were somewhat thin and lacking cheese opposed to others I've eaten.
1 Bad Service. Bad Food. My boyfriend ordered a kolashampan and they were flat. Ugly interior with a sign that says Welcome To Gringo's. I ordered the plantains with cream and beans. These were the most watered down beans I ever had. Horrible. My boyfriend's egg had runny oil. Ugh. I wish I had a warning.
1 horrible service. horrible smell., the bathroom had no air freshener. no refills on water?!!?!?!?!?!   brought in coupon and they still made us pay full price.  no other customers there and the place looks like shit but they have $30,000 security system!?  i now know why everyone hates salvadorians
