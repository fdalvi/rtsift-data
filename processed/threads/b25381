5 Best place ever if you have kids because you can bribe them that if they do something well, they can go to the dollar store and pick out WHATEVER THEY WANT.  It's truly amazing.
4 Dollar Tree Ahwatukee!  Conveniently located right next to the Safeway in this shopping plaza.  Great customer service for what it is, and friendly cashiers. So it always makes me sad to see some Ahwatukee Stepford Wife unloading on one of these poor people for things beyond their control. *eyeroll* Because God forbid you have to drive just a little more than a mile down the road to the Chandler and Kyrene store for your little prince or princess' party favors.  Best place for gift wrap, bags, ribbons, foil balloons, you name it and they probably have it. Unless you're looking for something uber specific, why pay more at Target?  Where else could you find $1 cookie tins, BAGS of Reeses, York, Snickers, M&Ms etc. for a last minute White Elephant gift at the office?  Check it out if you're in the area and need something basic. Promise it will be the most "bang for your buck"!
