5 Really great experience.  Hired the service online for a ride from sky harbour to Sedona.  The billing site was a little rough, but Martin called and made everything right.  My driver Tim knew a lot about the area, gave me a bunch of good tips! On time, professional, clean, and very kind. I would definately recommend them and use them again!
5 I hired Crown Sedan for an hour, to transport my son and his new bride from his wedding venue to his hotel. The car was also then available to take other wedding guests from venue to hotel. The whole experience was excellent from start to finish. My initial communication with Martin (owner?) was clear, timely and helpful. I had shopped around for the service and car we anticipated and found Crown's rates to be very competitive. The driver, Tim was on time, very professional and kind. My son said his experience with the ride was just perfect. You couldn't ask for more, especially on such an important day. Thank you Crown Sedan!
5 You must try this car service.  You will not be disappointed.   Awesome service,  I could not believe the excellent communication, the friendly service offered,  clean and professional driver plus the car was very clean.   I will suggest this car service company to all my friends and family.   Don't waste your time looking for another car company -  you will find the price to be very competitive.     I don't believe you will find another car service at this price that will offer so much for the money
