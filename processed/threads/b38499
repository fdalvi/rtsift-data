5 Went here for the first time to get a pedi. Staff was very nice and took their time. They made the experience relaxing & enjoyable. They take credit cards/debit cards for payment, but tips they have a sign that says cash.
5 Best nail shop in Gilbert! Friendly staff, and excellent service!

5 My favorite nail place that is family owned. They are fairly new but very nice, friendly and always offer 20% off specials over $30. They do a great job! I would highly recommend coming here.
