5 The place is open 24/7, is pretty quick with orders, is priced very competitively. I have yet to find a better place for tortas!
3 Al pastor fries, two carne asada tacos, one large horchata. About $12.50. Came here because the lines at a competing taco place were ridiculous. The guys working were really nice and the horchata was super yummy. Food was served up quickly. The boyfriend said the asada was a little dry and while my fries were good (meat, nacho cheese, queso fresco, sour cream) I wouldn't have minded guac and a little more meat. I would come back because of the low price and/our if my original restaurant choice didn't pan out.
5 I love getting burritos from Tortas El Rey!! I always customize my burritos and they always get my order right at this location. The burritos are very large so you won't be dissatisfied when it comes to size. I have come to this location multiple times and love it every time. The building looks a little run-down, but the food is great and the service is great! I never have to wait a long time before I get my food and they have a covered outdoor area with tables to eat at that's located next to the building. They also have a drive-thru if you're in a hurry. I would definitely recommend eating here if you are craving Mexican food!
