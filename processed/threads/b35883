4 So I finally ordered from this place after looking at the menu on eat24 website for awhile.  The menu is pretty standard:  pizza, sandwiches, salads, chicken wings.  I ordered the medium wings which were super yummy with homemade ranch dressing on the side.  I also ordered a small 10"pizza.  The pizza was just ok, kinda bland.  The only thing that made it good was it was the only place I know of around here I can order a small pizza, a true small, good when you don't feel like a huge pizza but still want a slice.  And the min order was only $10 with no delivery fee.  I don't mind delivery fees but some places charge way too much and you have to order a lot of food.  I will try this place again for sure.
1 I had found this place on grubhub a while ago and finally decided to order dinner from them tonight.  I ordered a spinach & artichoke heart pizza and an appetizer combination platter.  The food was delivered in about an hour, after the delivery person drove away I opened the appetizer box and it was a cheeseburger.  I called immediately thinking the guy could turn around because my order was switched with another in his car.  The lady told me they would get the platter right out to me.  Well, here it is 3 hours later and they never came back, or called (phone number entered on grubhub.com).  Finally decided to heat up the cold cheeseburger and eat it.  Very unprofessional.
