5 This Veteran's Day was my first time having Shutterbooth for my own event. They came to U.S.VETS' annual event honoring veterans and the military - a fundraiser for our homeless veteran programs. Their service was awesome and the photos were a huge hit! A great souvenir for our guests and brought lots of fun to the party. Many guests said the Shutterbooth was their favorite part of the whole night!  Thank you also for staying a bit after the event so those of us who were busy working the event could have some fun afterwards too!  I will definitely use you again and recommend you to others!!
4 I had my first experience with Shutter Booth of LV at last nights Yelp! Seats event. The employees were a delight to work with and also very patient as they waited for my friend Melissa and I to finish eating before we stepped into the booth. I really liked the whole wallet sized photo printout idea and the professionalism displayed by the employees was impeccable. :-)
5 I loved using ShutterBooth for my wedding! They were sooo helpful, engaging and polite. The booth led to many of my favorite memories! I highly recommend them!
5 Springs Preserve had Shutterbooth set up during the Ice Cream Festival and the family loved it!  They have some amusing props to add  excitement to the photos which we took advantage of.  Ian, who was manning the booth was SENSATIONAL and HOT!  He was patient with the crowds and kept the line flowing.     I'm excited that my sister booked Shutterbooth for her upcoming wedding...can't wait!!!!
5 They were so fun! They were at Yelp's nerdy Dancing at the Royal House. They were so fun, nice, and friendly. They let us take as much pictures as we wanted. They had a bunch of fun accessories or costumes to put on to make our pictures funnier! You have the option of getting it in color or black and white. We took the option of getting it in color! The gentleman was nice enough to even press the color button for us. THANK YOU SIR! YOU GUEST SERVICES WERE AWESOME! We used some gigantic summer shades and a viking hat for dramatic effect. The best part is, you can find your photos online at shutterbooth.com and then upload it to your facebook. THANKS AGAIN! That was super fun.
5 Love love love Shutterbooth of Las Vegas!!!  So if any of you brides are dealing with a mother like mine, it can be hard to get what you want in your wedding as opposed to what she thinks is "appropriate"... i.e. boring!!!  So when we went to the appointment at Shutterbooth she was all against it AND when we pulled up to this little office I saw her nose all up in the air.  But right when we walked in we were met by Dawn and she started to win my mother over.  She let us take sample pics in the both there and my mom saw how fun it could be.  Then Dawn told us about all the party favor options and ways we could have the pics and my scrapbook look and we were sold.  The service the entire time was great.  Any emails I sent were responded to quickly, even my mother constantly changing her mind about the font was handled with patience.  At the event they were fun and professional.  I didn't have to worry about them running out of supplies or not accommodating all 100 of my guests.  Everyone loved the favors and took multiple pics.  All-in-all we had a blast and I would TOTALLY use them again.  Good job Vegas team!!
5 I'm a photographer myself and kind of picky about presentation. I knew I wanted a photo booth at my wedding- but the ones I looked at initially seemed "tacky."   Then I saw Shutterbooth. Shutterbooth gets outstanding ratings in every aspect of their services- it's definitely the best (and most fun). I used Shutterbooth for my wedding and everyone had a blast... the staff I dealt with was super friendly and there's no pressure- just great information. I would use these guys again in a heartbeat. Derek and Sarah ran our booth on our big day and they were super sweet and awesome! Love love love this company!!
5 You guys are the best.  Everybody had so much fun. We made a great decision.  thanks again. Especially to TODD.
5 We hired Shutterbooth for our 5/6/11 wedding.  They were fantastic! From the beginning dealing with Todd (who was probably the most responsive wedding vendor I dealt with) to our host Dan, I couldn't be happier. Our guests absolutely loved it, and it's so much fun to still see the photo strips on peoples' fridges!  I would highly recommend Shutterbooth!
5 We used Shutterbooth of Las Vegas for our wedding.  Todd came highly recommended by our venue.  We met him at our venue's open house a few months earlier and although I loved the idea of a photo booth, it was one of the those extra expenses that I wasn't sure we should add to our already expensive wedding.  I thought about how much fun our family and friends had with the photo booth at my brother's wedding and I went ahead and booked with Todd.  Todd was responsive and professional throughout the entire process.  He let me used my own logo that I designed for other pieces of my stationery.  He was patient during my crazy busy period.  Our attendant (I believe it was Joe) was amazing with our guests.  He even entertained my friend's three year old son.  The online gallery was posted very quickly and within days of returning home, we received a DVD with all images and a very nice note from Todd.    I cannot think of one bad thing to say about Shutterbooth.
5 Professional, friendly and great quality photobooth pictures.  Joe was our event host and he was friendly to all our guests.  They were quick in sending a link of all the pictures and followed up with the cd too!
5 The whole team at ShutterBooth was nothing short of phenomenal. On very short notice, they were able to provide us with the perfect photo booth for our wedding at a price that fit perfectly in our budget. Our guests absolutely loved it - it was the perfect complement to our reception. I HIGHLY recommend ShutterBooth for any sort of event - A+ product, A+ customer service.
5 By far, the ShutterBooth staff was the easiest wedding vendor to work with! We experienced no hiccups with them at all and they made everything so personalized and worry-free. Dawn, Sara and Mark all assisted us pre-wedding with pricing, design of our photo strip and nailing down other details. They let us provide additional props for the wedding day and they made sure everything that was ours was returned to us properly.   I was leaning towards going with a cheaper photo booth, one that was about $300, but I realized there's no point to having a run-down photo booth that was going to breakdown every few attempts. ShutterBooth was recommended to us by another amazing and reliable wedding vendor, Paper and Home and they also turned out to be a preferred vendor for our venue.   ShutterBooth is a high-quality, customer-focused company and our guests were all very impressed. KC was our day-of photo booth attendant and he was so welcoming, friendly and informative. I believe he was relatively new to the company, but he was definitely trained well and handled things like a photo booth veteran! I'm honestly not a big fan of photo booths because I think the props can get a bit tacky, but the props they provide are on the higher-end of the prop spectrum and photograph well. Our photos were updated to their website very quickly and our guests had such a great time. Thanks again ShutterBooth!
