4 I have always loved this place! Even dating back to the Factory 2-U stores. I used to shop the location off of Decatur a lot when I lived in Summerlin. Was so happy this location opened just months before my move back to Green Valley.  This store is way smaller than the Decatur location but it doesn't lack the deals. I find some of the same product here that I find at that other location but just not as much. I also have to say that the clientele is better here despite being approached by a customer during my last visit trying to sell me cheap jewelry!  I mainly shop this location for home decor and accessories. The clothing at this location doesn't even compare to the one on Decatur near the Meadows Mall. That location has Levi's jeans, semi-designer shoes and sports jerseys. This one has hardly any clothing worth lifting off the racks for a closer look.  Good thing I have enough clothes. Home decor is awesome here and the prices are super awesome. I'm a fan and will be here a lot!
4 WOW, If you want sales! I see things for 1.99 brand new, cheaper then Goodwill! They do not have much for plus sizes but there are some. They have a lot of kids and juniors misses sizes. The mens sizes seemed to be a lot of m and small sizes left.  Easy to park and in a nice place to shop.  They also have shoes and home d√©cor and some toys or off the wall items.  If you catch them during a sale you can stock up! great deals, but busy and unkempt a lot. Watch the floor for hangers so you don't trip. :)
