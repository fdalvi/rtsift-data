1 This KFC/Taco Bell sucks! The food is NEVER fresh, the wait is never less than 10 minutes in the drive thru, and they never give you silverware and napkins in your bag! Even after the building was remodeled, the quality of food and service has not gotten better! Thumbs down KFC and Taco Bell and zero stars! Such a shame, this is a nice area but this place needs new management.
1 Slow slow slow and ran by a bunch of teenage kids chicken was very dry. Please dont wast your time and $$
1 Simply awful location.  My most recent trip was at prime dinner time (6:30 on a Saturday) and they still managed to give us terribly stale food.  The biscuits were crunchy all the way through.  Seriously, how long were they out to get that way.  Completely hard.  The corn was dry and shriveled.  The "extra crispy" chicken was barely crispy in some parts, and mush in other parts.  Stay away from this location.
1 The food & management are beyond terrible. We went in 3-3-14 to get some chicken to go. The cheese & macaroni were spoiled & half the chicken was dried out. I called the restaurant 4x's & have never gotten a human. It always went to voice mail. I have left 3 messages & I have never received a call back. I called again today & the voice mail said the memory is full. I  called the corporate headquarters 3x's. I requested a call back & a supervisor to call me back 2x's. To date still no call back from the restaurant or KFC Headquarters . I will never go back. Don't waste your time or your money. I won't be going to any KFC. If I could give it less than a one star I would.
