5 had a wonderful time in Vegas last week and got an incredible spray tan by Pamela at SprayTans!!!  Pamela did the most awesome spray tan I've ever had... Love love love it!!!!  I will def go back to her next time I'm in Las Vegas..Just wish she had a SprayTans here in Indiana!!!!   I highly recommend this salon especially Pamela!!!
5 My wife tried them out and looked really natural, not orange at all. I decided to give it a shot and it was awesome. Lasted me a week and made me look a lot better going to the pool. Definitely will do it again soon. Thanks Pamela!
5 Pamela is wonderful! Their product is fantastic also! My spray tan lasts for at least 7 days and NO orange! My tan looks likes PERFECTION everytime I get sprayed.
