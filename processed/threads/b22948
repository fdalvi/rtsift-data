5 My new favorite nail salon. Amazing family owned spot with great talent. Teresa does amazing nail art and lashes. I love, love this place. Will be back very soon. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a consistent nail salon you can trust.
3 Got a gel mani & regular pedi - cost=$55.. Little too pricey for me especially coming from San Diego where it only cost me $38 for the exact same service. The nail tech was nice and friendly though. My nails turned out ok ... Nothing special...Just feel this salon is overpriced.
1 Very bad customer services!!!!!!!! They do not  know how to do gel manicure!!!! It looks so thick and all bubbles ..... Horrible customer services.... I am very disappointed ..... Those people don't know how to run business ... I will never recommend  it   ....very low class......
