3 I usually only stop at pierce's because it's on my way home from work. their selection is limited, but the store is clean and the employees are friendly. I wouldn't be thrilled to have to do all of my shopping here, but it does the trick if I only have to pick up a few things.
4 The store is very clean and the manager is super friendly. They always have good deals going on, they also have a rewards card there that can get you free items!
1 If you stop here, make sure you watch while they scan your items.  This is my final visit to this place because something ALWAYS is mispriced, or I grab an item that was placed in an incorrect location, so it is obviously not the price I expected.  Staff is then rude when you ask for a correction in the price- as if it is my fault.  This never happens at other stores.  Being a city with a lot of competition, these silly errors can not keep happening, or else the place will have even less customers.  Very disapointed for the final time.  Oh-one other fine fact.  Be sure to check your expiration dates....have bought expired product there more than once.
