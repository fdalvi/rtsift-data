5 LG's Barber Shop is the real deal. LG's used to be Gracida's on Baseline.  It is a classic Barber shop with great prices and the best shave in town.
1 Nice clean barber shop that looks very professional. Sit down and watch the big screen while you get your hair cut. The problem is, so does the barber. He's very interested in the movie and keeps checking on the action as he cuts my hair. He's so involved with the movie he never asks how I would like my hair cut so I volunteer how and he just grunts.   No matter what I say, he does it his way, probably the only way he knows how resulting in what appears to be the "bowl" technique. He never asks if I want side burns - swipe, they're gone.  Live and learn. Another lesson for me. I'm convinced, guys just don't know how to cut hair or they really don't care to do what they're doing.  Another reviewer likes that "there's not a wait". Any wonder why?
