1 I cannot say anything good about the services this company supposed provided.  Bed bug service was supposed to eliminate problem within 2 weeks, yet almost a month later the bedroom is still infested.  I have called the company too many times with no response or simply no answer.  I would definitely NOT recommend this company.
1 Terrible.  Rip off pigeon control.  Dishonest and won't call you back.  This guy clearly isn't in this business for the long haul...he doesn't care.  Do not call them!
1 Don't use them! Took our money for Pigeon Control. The NEXT day a wire came down. They never answer the phone and  never did come back when we finally did get ahold of them. LOUSY SERVICE!!!!
1 Next to impossible to get a hold of. They came out for a bed bug sitch, Ian the 'certified tech' came in, looked around tearing the place up, gave some nebulous directions-everything in the middle of the room, don't worry about the clothes-SHOT MY KIDDO IN THE HINDQUARTERS WITH HIS NEW NERF GUN (he just turned 4) at which he cried, and then had us leave so he could fog. HORRID service but at least we're out $530 dollars. Hey Ian the Tech: my son has been practicing aiming and if you ever show up again he's ready for you. Wear a cup, dude.
