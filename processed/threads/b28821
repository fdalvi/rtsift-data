4 The Informatics Forum, just like the Dugald Stewart Building is a very recent appearance on Edinburgh University's George Square campus. Because it's essentially the same building. But somehow, probably because it houses people who might actually have careers (instead of the plain ol' geeks at the Dugald Stewart side of the establishment), it's actually way snazzier than DSB.   I only know this because I went into the Informatics Forum for one of those hour-long above-minimum-wage experiments that you do when you're unemployed and desperate. They had paintings! Or, one painting. But that's one more than I've ever seen in the Dugald Stewart Building.
4 I did training for a job working on behalf of the University of Edinburgh here and the facilities here are really great. As you would expect for an informatics forum it is kitted out with good levels of equipment the students that frequent it.  The Informatics forum's main purpose is to be the hub for informatics students (of course), but also the humanities and social sciences department and the student support service department. The design of the building is really great and is a true example of how modern architecture can really complement and cohabit  amongst older buildings.
4 The Informatics Forum is a fantastic new building at the University of Edinburgh. It has a beautiful, big atrium and is excellent for events. I attended a conference there today and the main lobby and beautiful areas on the ground floor were excellent for the coffee and lunch receptions, and the conference room was also very nice with big windows. I'd highly recommend it for events, and the catering (Edinburgh First or Blue Sky) is usually great too!
