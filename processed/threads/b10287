4 This very quiet resturant has some somewhat rude customer service, but the food is fresh and the vibe here is more local than some of the flashier places as you get closer to the Strip or even Downtown.  I ordered  a 10-piece nugget meal with a Dr Pepper. I was able to get refills just by asking, which is always a plus. The dining room was mostly empty save for a group of women and a small family. It was nice and peaceful for eating. The fries were actually really good; I didn't know the recipe changed again.  I'd come here again if I was the DD for an exhausted and hungry drunkard looking for a chili baked potato!
1 If I could give them zero stars, I would. Extremely rude staff. Horrible customer service.
1 If you like it slow and stinky this is the place.  And I like fast food when I'm at airports :(
4 I ordered a quick snack since I forgot to eat lunch.  I went through the drive thru.  I ordered some fries and a small burger.  My order was correct and tasted like it's supposed too.  The service was good and I was in and out of there quickly.  I went around 4:30pm.  I didn't have an issue.
