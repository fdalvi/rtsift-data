5 Great place to look for those finishing touches when decorating. They have a great selection of upscale gently used and also new furnishings. Very reasonable prices and very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Also have licensed interior designers to help with your design needs.
1 My experience with Consign2Design was very disappointing to say the least.  I went in one day saw a wall clock I wanted but needed to measure my wall, the next morning I called and asked then to hold it for me since I couldn't get there till afternoon, she said they don't hold items (which I understand).  I said I wanted to buy it and she took my name, she did not ask for my credit card which I would gladly have given.  I didn't think to offer it, I drove quite a distance to the store in the afternoon and was told they had sold it.  This is not good customer service.
