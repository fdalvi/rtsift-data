4 If you're the proud owner of an expensive or high end bike and you are looking for high quality and most importantly reliable parts or upgrades for your bike, this is probably the best place to come for these.  The prices here, whilst value for money when you consider the quality of the items you are buying, are too high to justify buying these parts for a cheap bike.  There is no point putting expensive parts on a cheap bike, but there is also no point buying an expensive bike and then putting cheap parts on that.  If you are after cheap parts then my best recommendation would be to visit Bike Station instead.  If you do have a good bike, instead of diminishing it by putting on cheap parts come here and get the parts the bike deserves.
