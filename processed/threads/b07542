1 This company is awful,   they take your money and then rarely come thru with any service.  Long hold times,  get the run around when your travel doesn't go as planned.      They sell HIGH pressured Memberships over the phone,   with LIMITED time pricing and free vacations.    NEWSFLASH - their prices NEVER change  weeks later .   so dont' fall for it.     they sell under   ICE Platinum Rewards and Westgate Cruise and Travel and about 20 other cover names - so people don't who is scamming them.     Stay Away from this company,  It is nothing but bad news and $2,000 -3,000 of lost money.
1 This company is the "wolf of wall street" wanna-be's. I have family who own timeshares in Cabo Azul and would never do business with these schmucks (also wont be able to because they don't work with HIGH_END TIMESHARES). They pre-purchase ALL their inventory and when you call to reserve... well "it's not available." The CFO Jeremy Rowley is a hand fed, Pre-Madonna 2nd generation rich kid who can't understand normal thinking. He walks around the "sales floor" like he knows everyone. He has no idea what is going on "over the phone". All he knows is, Chris Cole aka the director of membership sales is playing Frisbee golf. If you BUY A MEMBERSHIP TO WESTGATE CRUISE & TRAVEL, (PLATINUM OR "LIFETIME"), ICE PLATINUM, ICE REWARDS. They are all the same inventor (which is bullshit and over-priced). If you ever get a chance to speak to Elizabeth Campbell...... ex sales women, turned supervisor... well you will hear the "run around' aka "we will get back to you," "let me talk to my manager," aka BULLSHIT.  All in all.... this is just another phone room!
