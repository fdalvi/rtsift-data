1 Horrible experience and will NOT return. Totally disorganized. Most of the empty tables were unbussed. Three lines merged into one and orders were not taken correctly. Workers were standing around with dazed looks and unwilling to help - they simply pointed to a different person when asked for assistance.
3 This Paradise Bakery deserves better than one one star review. A recent visit here late one afternoon, but before the dinner hour rewarded us with our favorite fire roasted tomato soup. Indeed, I like it so much it's hard for me to order anything else, especially paired with a grilled cheese sandwich. Nothing better! This time I tried the asiago steak sandwich, which was good but a bit dry. The soups and salads look wonderful, and the turkey chili and Greek salad are other favorites. The wait staff were helpful and not unfriendly, but I did notice a bit of laxness at the checkout. Nobody there and customers with trays wondering what to do. I also observed people coming in not seeming to know what to do. There is a large "Pay Here" sign over the register, but no sign saying, "Order Here".  Of course we'll be back. It's a welcome stop after shopping, A more prominent hostess to greet newcomers would be helpful.
2 I was not happy spending $31 on a kids meal and 2 YouPick 2 meals. Not to mention I get to the register ready to use my free meal I KNOW I have and I'm told I only have a free muffin. I am quite pissed about that. Kids meals don't come with drinks. My Mediterranean flatbread was icky. Not sure what happened to the old menu, but Paradise has gone downhill in my book. Sorry to say...
