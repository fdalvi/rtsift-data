2 Sunday morning before 11am we were there and it was packed to the gills at this IHOP. OMG, the waiting area inside was full, the wait area in between the inside and outside doors were full and the entrance has about 4 people stand around. WOW! We waited about 20 mins for 5 of us.   The menus were sticky and mine had a smashed paper liner of a straw in it. The table looked clean and the seats were redone. The place got HOT, there was a lot of people.   I got the ham and cheese omelet. It was a little dry. The french toast was pretty good.   All in all, meh....
2 Sub par pancakes and the omelettes are ehhhh. Only reason why I've been here are those drunken late nights and nothing is open. I need to stop drinking and eating here.
4 I love this one because it is after all the closest one to my house... I just wish that getting a seat was faster, so alot of times we order from home and take it home to eat... That can cause a little confusion though because the register up front never seems to have change... But overall very friendly people....
1 I would suggest not coming here! I have had nothing but terrible experience after terrible experience. First time coming in we stood at the front for 20 minutes with no greeting and no one to seat us, so we left. Second visit we decided to give it another shot, service was a little better, but an hour after eating here we ended up sick as dogs,  not able to hold anything down we called to see what they would say, first person I spoke to said they were "revamping" and made it sound like other customers like myself had been getting sick as well and they had to change staff. Second person I called was the manager who basically told me that it couldn't be them it had to be what ever I ate before we went there, weird because I didn't have anything in my stomach til we ate there and started feeling sick a hour after eating their food. After hours of throwing up and not being able to hold anything down, I get a call from the manager that they can send us a gift card, although a nice gesture, I'd rather never eat there again and avoid the risk of getting sick. I suggest not coming here.
2 Eh. Coffee was gross. Waiter got my order wrong (which he never wrote down). Service wasn't that great and food was crap. Rather go somewhere else.   On the plus side...Military discount..but not much.
3 IHOP is an OK place to go for breakfast or a pancake craving. You won't find anything amazing and the pancakes are probably as good as you can make at home, but it's a place that you can count on to be open at really late hours, which is nice. I like their chocolate chip pancakes!
5 For it being a chain restaurant  it's a pretty great place. Came here with my mom for a Christmas dinner as it's just the two of us. It was slightly busy but we got excellent service and our food came out in a timely matter and it was delicious. I got the scrambled eggs with cheese. Most other places make the eggs then sprinkle the cheese on top after the eggs land on the plate. Here they cook it with the cheese so its nice and gooey, the way I like it. I also got the pumpkin pancakes which I thought were amazing. Our server, Tiffany, was great and attentive despite how busy it was. I'll be asking to sit in her section next time we go in.
5 IHOP is the perfect place for breakfast , lunch , pretty much anytime of the day; I mean who doesnt love pancakes at 2PM?  I ordered the pancake combo and im picky so my order was kinda specfic and alot to take in but it came out perfect!  My server, Christian, awesome guy and hell actually conversate with you unlike servers who are "strictly professional" with you.  I recommend this IHOP anytime!
5 Grate place new on my watch. I would come back agian. Good place be shore to come with friends.
2 Good food, yet poor service... During my last and other recent visits the food is good, yet the service really sucks! Last night, I had watched a customer who repeatedly got up from the back of the restaurant and headed to the servers station asking for their beverage, a change in beverage( due to server error, remind you I know this because I was sitting close to the server stations.  Now my experience was not that great either.  We were seated immediately and of course asked what beverage would me and my guest like whilst In the process of sitting. This just shows me the manager was in a hurry. Our server came and greeted me and my company and politely introduced herself.  That's a plus!! Upon delivering our beverages.. The server was rushing and  kind of slammed our drink a on the table.. I thought nothing of it.. Now it took a while before our order was taken, we had no table settings, I can understand that, I did not have my meal yet.  Now, we placed our order, and we waited, we patiently waited and my company had finished her beverage.. It took her a while before she could get a refill.. :( still no settings.. Food was cooked And I see it was delivered up on the cooks window.. No server to deliver our food.. Minutes passed... Food finally delivered. Server delivered our food in haste, not giving me time to ask for settings.. Minutes later.. I got the manager's attention.. Finally.. Settings.. Refill, an hour later. I'm not exaggerating here. The quality of service desperately needs attention!
5 So we found ourselves on this part of town when running errands & I really felt like some Garden Stuffed Crepes so decided on a whim 2 visit my fave IHOP loc8ion. I've never gotten bad or even just decent service here & I always get a warm inviting vibe from the interior lighting & decor in warmer pastel hues.        Ok, so part of it may b a li'l nostalgia being I used 2 work in this shopping plaza & across the street back in my GCC days when I lived over here but I find it impressive that they're the ONLY place in this vicinity that's STILL here from even b4 back then when everything else has changed businesses several Xs or been LONG GONE. It was also unusual not 2 have 2 w8/b put on the list as whenever we've been here on wk~ends it's always pretty slammin' but I never mind the w8 as it's worth it.     Have mostly eaten inside w/ the cushy booths but have also ventured out 2 the patio area a few Xs under the misters when it's been nicer weather outside. 2day we were served by w8ress Lindsay who had just come on 4 her shift but didn't know that till she told us l8er as she was the usual on~the~ball type service we've always experienced here.      I was disappointed 2 discover they had removed the Garden Stuffed Crepes from their new menu as it was my favor8 (& a gr8 price) but I guess it did have a good run as I'd been surprised many Xs 2 c it still offered all those previous occasions. So instead I ordered the Spinach Red pepper sandwich on sourdough which came w/ seasoned fries & my companion had the Strawberry Crepes w/ a side of wheat Banana Pancakes (Gr8 w/ their Butter Pecan flavored syrup ~ just another trademark of theirs 2 luv w/ several selections 2 choose in addition 2 Strawberry, Boysenberry & their Original).      All was Delicious as we've come 2 expect from all our previous visits here, but we were both blown away by the PERFECTION of the sandwich!! We ordered this same item @ 19th/Northern & tho it was really good & nice size portion there, this loc8ion just has it down as far as the complimentary blend of quality ingredients surrounded by a perfectly seasoned Toasted Crispy Sourdough on the outside & savory softness w/o being soggy or  greasy on the inside & fries were SUPERb 2 ~ Major props 2 the cook/preparer!! So thx Lindsay 4 ur #1derful,  friendly, attentively accomod8ing & professional service 2day + all the other patrons we saw u taking such good care of! Awesome food, Amazing & quick service @ a Gr8 Price, it's no 1der this will remain our FAVE, the other loc8ions can't hope 2 compete w/ what we experience here! Just really wish they would BRING BACK the GARDEN STUFFED CREPES 4 us Veg~heads ~ that's the ONLY thing I can say that would make it even more PHENOMENAL!!...
1 My sister got Chorizo, she took one bite and automatically she made a face, it was way too salty!! Being the nice person she is. She tried to cover it up with ketchup, that was still a horrible taste. So the waiter came and took it away. Didn't even bother for a new order or ask if she wanted anything else.  Strawberries banana pancake. Is what my nephew got. I told him to put the banana on a separate plate because I am allergic.( we're sharing). 15 minutes later, his pancakes came out. No bananas in sight.. We ask him four times that were missing a plate of bananas. Yet. No bananas. I was annoyed because my nephew didn't want to eat, so I got up myself and ask the people in the back to give me a bananas. And when they did, the banana was bruised!!!  I ordered the vegetarian omlette, it was volcano on with massive cheese. When I eating eggs? Or cheese? cheese! I just took off the cheese and try to eat what I have on my plate.. it was bad. All bad. :/  Overall, the food was horrible,  I still paid for it, andd TIPPED. This was just a horrible experience.
