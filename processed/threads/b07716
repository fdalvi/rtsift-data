1 So I have been into this place twice and both times left me swearing I was gonna torch the place. If you ever want a good example of how not to treat customers this would be it. The  manager was even arrogant and rude. First time we went in we got a set of glasses that weighed a lot so i managed to get the cart into middle of the street before the front end manager came running out the door to tell me that I must bring the cart back. I asked her if I could just take my glasses to the car laughing and saying they were heavy. she replied absolutely not, bring it back inside now. so I left the cart in the middle of the street and walked away with my purchases and told her to get it herself if it was that big a deal for her. She shouted happy holidays to you too. I flipped her off and walked away. The next time I went in with my 14 year old cousin. As I am walking in I had a coke in my hand from one of the restaurants there and I was told i needed to not carry it through the store. The security guy told me he would hold it for me If I liked. I told him I was done with it and asked if they had a trash can at the counter. They told me I would have to go back outside the store to throw away the soda. Exceptionally rude the whole time I went to another store and will not be returning to shop there ever again.
1 Was out shopping with a friend before going to see a movie. It was 106 degrees outside so we first stopped at Starbucks for some iced drinks. Out drinks both had lids. Upon entering Ross we were immediately asked to throw out our drinks or leave. We left. It's 106 outside in Phoenix, AZ. Ross is located in an OUTDOOR strip mall. My drink had a lid on it. I am 30 years old, not some obnoxious child.
1 Worst Ross ever!! Hard to find and it is always empty and never good finds. after a few trips I will not going back to this one!!
