3 Not my favourite restaurant, but it does the job and the food fills the space!  There's nothing particularly modern about this Chinese restaurant, in fact there's nothing remotely modern about it.  From the pink tablecloths to the folded fan napkins, Wong's is a little bit stuck in the seventies decor-wise and I'd be surprised if the menu has seen a reboot since then either.  However, the food isn't bad and the price refelcts my initial judgment - stuck in the seventies, but I certainly won't complain about that!  What Wong's also offers is a 'Crunch Lunch', £4 for 2 courses with a soft drink, now you can't say fairer than that!  And that price is dropped to £3.80 if you have a can instead of draught!  Doesn't say much for the quality of the ingredients, but nevermind, we're not here for quality!  Wong's is for you if you're hungry, skint and have nowhere else to go!  But still delivers a surprisingly satisfying experience!
3 Had the Singapore spicy noodle and salt-n-spicy soft shell crab.  The noodle was ok, a bit on the bland side.  The crab was tasty.  It was soggy by the time it was delivered, but I wonder if it'd be crispier at the restaurant.  Price was comparable to other Chinese restaurants at around GBP 7-9 per dish.  I'd give it an extra half stars for its super quick delivery.
