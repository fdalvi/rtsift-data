1 The owner of this flooring retailer is named Greg Topel, and he evidently thinks it's okay to SCREAM at customers who hire him to do $10,000.00+ in floor covering.  His company, Custom Crafted Floor Covering (CCFC), installed some flooring at a town home my mother bought for investment purposes, a place for my husband, my dogs and myself to live conveniently close to her (she is almost 80). I ordered an Aladdin/Mohawk carpeting for the stairs, upstairs hallway, three bedrooms and closets after comparing it with the taupe paint general contractor Dan Cooney @ SDCI (look for my upcoming separate complaint) thought was a perfect match.  Problem is is that neither Topel nor his receptionist, the unpleasant Laura--who violated my rights (per the FDCPA) when I told her not to telephone us anymore and to please contact us in writing through the USPS--seem to understand that these are bad business practices.  So CCFC has begun proceedings to place a mechanic's lien on the home instead of trying to work with us; I am taking my own measures to correct the problem, but the folks at CCFC have made it clear that they want to fight.  Laura's reason for calling me in the first place was to obtain contact information (I provided her with our still-current address in Glendale) because she said CCFC has proof from Mohawk/Aladdin that the carpeting fell in the grey area called "the 15% variance allowance" or some such ridiculous excuse; we are disputing that.  Meanwhile, we never received that letter from Mohawk denying our request to provide us with the carpeting we chose from the sample board.  We have no proof of anything, just the original invoice, which, by the way, was exceeded by $500.00 without our permission.   To make matters worse, I had the extreme displeasure of running into Laura the other night at a concert, and it's obvious that she brings her job home with her because she picked a fight with me.  She caused a scene and tried to humiliate me.  Bottom Line:  I told CCFC not to install the second carpeting unless I was there, so as to avoid any future disasters like the first time (which Dan Cooney AND Greg Topel verbally agreed would be best), since I had stopped by during the original installation of wrong color and none of Mr. Topel's installers paid any attention to me; they just kept working away while I told each and every one of them that it was the wrong color, and why didn't anyone notify me before installation?  Their response:  "We think it looks good!"  Like *their* opinion mattered in the first place.  Supposedly, the factory made a mistake, so I was given the opportunity to pick another carpeting with a shorter pile and it was supposed to be installed the following Monday; I told Dan/Greg to call me before carpeting was installed, and they did not.  Upon my original inspection of the second carpeting, I truly thought it was the first carpeting installed by CCFC, because the color is *that*  close.  When I got home, there was a message from Laura @ CCFC on my answering machine advising me that the balance of $2,040.00 was due immediately.  I was confused, as I honestly didn't know the carpeting had been changed at that point because the color of that second wrong carpeting is virtually identical to the original wrong color...just a shorter pile.  I called CCFC and asked Laura why they were asking for the balance when the second carpeting hadn't been installed and she put me on the phone with Greg, who screamed the whole time that he wasn't going to go through this with me AGAIN (if it wasn't my fault the first time, why did he say AGAIN, I wonder?), that that was the color I chose, that the carpeting had been installed that morning, that he wasn't going to play games with me...and me not even knowing what was going on!  I called Mr. Cooney afterward and told him to deal with his friend because I couldn't.  They both tried to tell me that the carpet was within the 15% industry standard for variance.  The problem is this:  even if what they say is true, pink undertones are completely absent from the carpeting, which is the color that is most necessary to the mix in order for the carpet to match the walls.  The color that is in there now is like a light tobacco brown, next to taupe containing cocoa color, pink highlights and a silvery grey color.  The carpet clashes with the walls, and we are at odds with these people; they refuse to provide paper trails for anything, or receipts, letters from the carpeting mfr about the original mistake, etc....nothing.  Very strange.  On a completely separate issue, CCFC neglected to install quarter-rounds against the baseboards in our kitchen.  Gaps everywhere!  Finish the job, Greg, or there will be more to come.  Independent licensed/bonded flooring inspector to check it out next week!  So much more to add to this nightmare of a story...will update soon!
1 The WORST!  Greg even screamed at me and lost his cool in front of the ROC inspector.  There were cracked tiles everywhere in the upstairs bathrooms which CCFC was obligated to replace; the laminate issue was not resolved because the ROC inspector could not determine WHY the floor is buckling EVERYWHERE.  Greg insists that the damage is due to my own negligence by not cleaning up after my dogs.  In reality, the flooring is uneven everywhere and it doesn't appear that CCFC installed the proper sub-flooring, or, as was explained to me by a Shaw Flooring rep, the flooring was destroyed because CCFC refused to finish the job in a timely manner and neglected to tell us that although we were unable to move into our home yet, it was necessary to keep our home climate-controlled to prevent the flooring from buckling.  It is a total insult to tell a customer that her own negligence caused such damage...especially a customer whose housekeeping skills rival those of someone who has a staff of professionals on hand at all times.  Another business that should be hired at your own risk.  Unprofessional in EVERY way.
5 I feel sorry for this company. This lady sounds crazy!! I have been using Custom Crafted Floor Covering for over 12 years, Mr.  Topel has been nothing but professional and  courteous and does impeccable work. He goes the extra mile to make sure all work is performed to my satisfaction, and I am very detail orientated I might add.GOD bless  you Mr Topel.
1 the second review for this company was posted shortly after i forwarded my review to mr. topel...funny how there were no reviews before i posted mine, and now there is a five-star review calling me crazy...ccfc is one of the most unprofessional companies i have ever had the displeasure of doing business with.  why can't you accept your bad review and move on, mr. topel?  one last thing:  just discovered that mr. topel's WIFE is the five star reviewer.  ccfc installed laminate over an uneven base floor, and i believe that is one of several reasons there are so many problems with our laminate.  at one point he sent an employee to look at the flooring, and we were advised to buy carpets to cover up the buckled areas.  Now there are several five-star reviews by people who joined Yelp specifically for the purpose of trying to offset my bad review dishonestly, and i have reported them to yelp!  lol, of course he does a flawless job in his own home!!! now they have all of their friends posting five star reviews, which is to be expected by thieving cheating liars.  ***angie's list, here i come!!!!***  i was told that businesses who get bad reviews on yelp frequently get their friends and family to offset the same...i hope that is not the case with angie's list, but we'll see, won't we?  even if all of the five star reviewers *did* get their flooring thru ccfc, greg wouldn't do a substandard job on his friends' flooring, now, would he?  this appears to be the work of mr. topel's wife, whom dan cooney told me wears the pants in the family...lol, dan said greg is totally henpecked (the nice way of saying it).  anybody want pictures of the crummy workmanship i got thru these people?  they installed laminate over uneven cement floor without any prepping what.so.ever.  everywhere we walk we hear creaking and feel hollow areas.  the most offensive part of all was having them blame us and our dogs for their substandard workmanship, the buckling everywhere, and the carpeting that **was not** aladdin, which was what we paid for (the cr@p they installed most likely came from greg's warehouse full of carpeting that he can't give away unless he is trying to screw over a customer...and i am one of those *lucky* winners!).  and when we had the registrar of contractors here last year, greg was advised to replace the 20+ cracked slate tiles in our bathrooms...oh, yeah, that was an awesome **first** attempt at getting it right, greg.  and the carpet had to be stapled down on three separate occasions at the bathroom entryways.  and the quarter rounds on the laminate had to be re-stapled twice.  and you were advised by the roc to put quarter rounds in some of the areas you intentionally neglected.  horrible, horrible people who don't know how to take responsibility for their errors, only place blame on customers who don't kiss greg's behind and accept such insults without a peep...don't know how these people sleep at night, but eventually they will be held accountable for their actions. NICE NEW touch to your review "Carol S."...make sure to cover your behind on who referred you to CCFC...ROTFLMFAO!!!!!!!  "If anyone is unhappy with the workmanship of this company, they have a problem."  And the quote up top is PRICELESS!!!  Love all the little jabs Greg's friends have made at me, when I have the right to tell the truth about my experience and not be taken to task for it.  Josh K., I see that you joined Yelp for the sole purpose of posting your one and only sickening review.  So pre-fab!!!!  S.A., evidently you did the same ;D  Hilarious how most of the other reviewers have not reviewed ANY OTHER COMPANY, except for the wifey, who has had a whole year to review four other businesses.
5 Quality isn't something that can be argued into an article or promised into it. It must be put there. If it isn't put there, the finest sales talk in the world won't act as a substitute. C. G. Campbell  If anyone is unhappy with the workmanship of this company, they have a problem.  I worked with Jeff and Greg, advising them of what I wanted.  They were able to start the Tuesday after and did my entire home after it was flooded.  Gonzo who did the work, was awesome in all respects.  He moved furniture, cleaned after himself, tolerated my dogs, very professional and exhibited outstanding workmanship.  My home looks like a new house and it actually looks better now than the day I moved in.  This company was recommended to me by Newtown CDC who rehabs homes for mid-income level people to buy.  I thank them for the reference.  Yelp, it is too bad we can't add pictures.
5 This company truly went above and beyond to help us with our carpet. The price was unbeatable and they were extremely flexible and so accommodating with our schedule (We rescheduled 3 times and there was never a fuss). Melissa and Jeff were very enjoyable to work with and made sure that the job was done right and exactly how we needed it. We look forward to working with them on future projects and highly recommend them to anyone that is looking for great carpet and great customer service (They even sent us a thank you card in the mail afterwards - Wow!) Thank you so much! James & Marsha Judge
1 If you have an enemy, recommend this company to them, for their work. This is the least professional company that I have ever had the experience of dealing with.  I have never taken the time to do a Yelp review (good or bad) but, this company is so horrible that I had to review them, to warn others to NEVER use them.  They came to my home to tile two bedrooms and a small bathroom.  Granted, this was not the biggest job for them to do but, I would still expect a little common courtesy and professionalism.  Not the case, at all, with this company.   My first impression, of the company, was not good, by any means.  The owner came out to my home to figure out what tile to use and where to tile.  That was on a Thursday.  On Friday, the office called me to let me know that they would be out on the following Thursday and, they would call me to let me know what time.  I cleared my schedule, for that day.  Then, I get a call on the following Monday night to let me know that the workers would be coming out on Tuesday morning.  I was told this, not asked if the push up in the day was ok.  I was not available on Tuesday morning so, begrudgingly, they set the time to come out, in the afternoon. It was inconvenient for me but, I made the time.  The owner was supposed to be there when the workers got there, at approximately 1:00PM,  to instruct them.  He was late so, the workers asked me what was to be tiled.  I let them know that it was the two rooms and the bathroom.  When the owner finally showed up, late, he again instructed them and he asked me about tiling the closets.  This is the owner of the company who had just been out to quote the job a few days before.  Apparently, my job was so insignificant for him and his company that he did not take notes on what was to be tiled.  It went even more down hill, from there.  First of all, the workers broke a vase, while in my home, and hid it from me until they were leaving.  I heard the vase break, as I was in the front room.  The workers said nothing to me about it so, I thought that it was a tile that broke.  As they were leaving, for the day, the worker in charge informed me that they broke a vase.  I guess they broke it and immediately cleaned it up and threw it away.  I understand that accidents happen.  The vase was a crystal vase, that was a gift.  The value was probably about $100.  The head worker seemed apologetic and offered to replace the vase.  He seemed sincere and, I was sure he didn't know the value of the vase.  I told him we could call it even, if he brought me some left-overs of the dinner his wife made that night.  I'm a single guy so, I was willing to accept a meal to replace my vase.  He did bring me a home-cooked meal, the next morning so, I was fine with the vase being broken.   Once the workers left, after supposedly all of the laying of the tile, I went back to see how it looked.  They were supposedly done with everything, other than having to come back the next day, to do the grout work.  I noticed that the tile in the bathroom had not been removed and nothing had been done in the bathroom.  I made comment about it, the next day, when they came and, they acted like they didn't know about the bathroom, even though I informed the head worker that the bathroom tile was to be replaced and, even though the owner, came out the first day to instruct them.  The owner didn't even know/care that the bathroom was supposed to be done.  Again, apparently, the job at my home wasn't big enough to warrant the owner taking proper notes on what was to be done and instructing his workers correctly.  The workers removed and replaced the tile, the second day when they came out, again, begrudgingly.  The owner had not instructed them correctly, the first day so, it caused more work for them, in the long run.  Now, I don't know if this next issue is due to the workers being upset or, due to the workers' unprofessionalism but, I was screwed even more by this company.  I was in the process of painting when Custom Crafted Floor Covering moved up the day that they were coming out to do my flooring.  Remember, they came out 2 days earlier, than they said they were coming and I had to adjust my schedule, on the fly, to meet their time.  I was also in the process of having my toilets replaced.  To do the tile, in the one bathroom, CCFC removed my toilet in there.  Well, they removed the toilet, full of water, and placed it in my shower, on a piece of cut tile.  When I went to throw out the old toilet, the water flooded everywhere.  You would think that the workers would have flushed the toilet to expel the water in it.  No such luck.  I realize that they are "flooring" guys and not plumbers but, any common sense would tell you to get rid of the water, in the toilet, before removing it.  On top of that, they took the painters tape and paper that I used to prep lines for painting and shoved it down the open hole from the toilet.  All my work, destroyed by them.  This co. suck
