5 They are a very conscientious place here.  I had accidentally not fully locked my unit and they called and let me know.  I was so grateful!
5 Safe, secure and gated. Property manager Shirley is always helpful, friendly and keeps the place very clean!! The $1 dollar move in deal is awesome and makes life easier when going through any move, business or home.
5 Great friendly fast service at this public storage in mesa!! I will tell all my friends this is a great place to store their stuff!!
5 Great customer service. The facility is clean, secure and overall well cared for. The staff does a great job. I once left something sitting outside and the property manager found it and instead of throwing it away kept it and met me at my unit when I went back.
5 Great place to store my stuff I truly recommend this location friendly service too. Will tell all my family and friends about coming here if they need storage. Thanks Public Storage!
