5 Hourly rehearsal rooms.  Fully back lined with gear.  $15 to $25 an hour is pretty cheap.  Especially if you jam with 3 or more people, the cost is nothing when it's split up.  No cops, no drama, and a clean fuckin bathroom!  Love this place!
5 This is the best hourly studio in Las Vegas. The parking lot features clean ash trays and a picnic table.  There are 5 rooms ranging in size and price. All types of bands practice here and everyone is pretty cool.  Earplugs, snacks and water are available in the office. Sometimes I go to MDV just to have a quite place to cry to myself.  You can call far in advance or the same day to book your time. HAVE FUN!!
