4 Did a lot of shopping around, his prices were the best. Josh does excellent work, though not always in a timely fashion. He seems to have more business than he can handle & could probably use help.
2 I put in an order in early April, was told by Angela that I would have a proof the next day.  2 days later I called back looking for my proof, was told I'd get a call back the next day, still nothing.  1 week later I called yet again looking for the proof, Angela said I would get a call back that day, nothing.  Finally yesterday I received a proof for the wrong type of sign, I asked them to correct it, they then sent me the correct type of sign, but with the wrong name and wrong phone number.  They do get 2 stars instead of 1 because I've used them in the past and they do make a quality sign.  I don't mind waiting as long as I'm given an accurate estimate.  Also Josh really is a nice guy, he just needs some additional help.
2 It doesn't cost any extra to be nice....and everyone is always 'nice' when I go in. They also print a nice sign. However, they have NO CLUE how to give outstanding customer service. Another example of how businesses can thrive despite their inadequacies.
1 I placed an order for 12 signs 3 weeks ago, I still do not have my signs. I went to the store to pickup a sample of the sign ordered 3 weeks ago and had to wait 40 minutes to be acknowledged. At no point in time did anyone greet me or say we will be with you in a minute.   This is the LAST order I ever give to this company. Lesson learned.
