2 Googlin', Yellow Paging, and even Pizzahut.com'in........Where the hell is your phone number. I know this PizzaHut hasn't gone out of business because I live 2 blocks away from it and yet surprisingly the phone number isn't listed anywhere.  This is the one on Buffalo and Blue Diamond Rd.  I just decided to go drive there instead of making a phone order and asked why they aren't listed on the internet and they said its not the first they've been asked about this.  They have no answer to why but it didn't matter and I just wasted my time because they don't even deliver, haha.   With that aside, the lady that was serving me was very friendly and gave me a fridge magnet with the phone number on it.  I don't usually go to pizzahut to buy pizza but decided to add it on with my orders of 44 piece wings since a large with 3 toppings was only $10 and the wings were $25 for 44 piece. Very good deal.  Maybe it's just me but I regret ordering the hottest flavor for the wings because I freaking couldn't handle it.  Wings were good though but just too hot for my taste so my lil' 15yr old bratty brother showed me up by eating all of it. I'd def come here for the wings but as far as pizzas goes, damn it tasted like a $10 large pizza.  I ordered the hawaiin toppings which was pineapple, sausage, with pepperoni.  The taste was very bland and nothing, even a tad bit to tickle my taste bud. But thats what I get for being cheap that day instead of going to my fav local joint, Familia Pizzeria.  Pizzas at PizzaHut, lesson learned.
3 Fast delivery and great specials are 2 reasons to order this when you don't feel like cooking and are not in the mood to ,eave the house.
3 I was planning on having a movie night, so I decided to order some pizza and wings. They have a special right now, $10 for any size pizza with any toppings, so I ordered a large pizza with half pepperoni and half mushrooms, peppers, sausage, and onions. The 8 wings I got were an extra $6.99. The total came out to about $21 because the delivery fee is $2.50 and it specifically states, "This does not include the deliverer's tip." I placed my order at 6:20pm and the expected delivery time was 7:02pm, but it didn't come until 7:14pm, which was a very long wait for what I ordered. If I knew it was going to take that long before placing my order, I would've just ran down to Little Caesar's to get some Hot-N-Ready pizzas. Nonetheless, the pizza and wings were decent and the delivery lady was nice. If she didn't give me free dipping sauces I probably would've given this location 2 stars.
5 I've been so tired of Papa John's lousy service and awful tasting pizza, I decided to give PH a try.  After several deliveries, I have found them to be friendly, fast and they make a great pizza.    For kicks and grins on my last order, In the "special instructions" field @ pizzahut.com I asked for a hand drawn dragon and unicorn on the boxes and they fulfilled the request and made my son's day, thanks Pizza Hut!
4 Pizza is very hit or miss in Vegas so when I wanted a sure thing, I came to Pizza Hut.  In my opinion there are few things which can top a stuffed crust pizza.  Normally I don't even eat the crust, but having the unique cheese filled crust is something I really look forward to.  I ordered using the online feature and requested extra sauce (I wouldn't have even thought to ask if it wasn't on the site).  The advantage to online is no need for coupon clipping as they have many online specials.  Pizza Hut is a definite "go to" when it comes to my at home movie nights!
4 This review is to continue my previous review posted from service a month ago. I wasn't impressed then however even though I never heard from the company after my complaint we tried it again. The convenience and price cannot be beat! Ordering online was easy. Pizza was ready in 15 minutes or carry out. It already looked better when being picked up. Fresh and delicious. Upon tasting the pizza it was just that. The crust was its nice buttery flavor and fluffy again. The toppings were generous and fresh. Only complaint would be there was too much sauce this time and the cheese wasn't quite cooked enough. Seemed a little underdone. However compared to last time this was boat loads better.   While I am still unimpressed there was no response after contacting the company at least I didn't get the same experience again. We will continue to order here when we don't feel like going far from home.
5 Always good, and close to my home! Love stuffed crust pizza & breadsticks on my "cheat" day :)
