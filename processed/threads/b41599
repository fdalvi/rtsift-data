5 Came in last night with my boyfriend because he's been in excruciating jaw pain. To the point he can't talk or chew.  we came in at 10:10ish we filed out the papers in 5 minutes & waited our turn. He saw the doctor & we left around 11:30pm it wasn't a bad experience but he left happy they took his Health insurance Cigna.  He was prescribed pain killers.   Update:  Going to meet the boyfriend at Hitech Dental on Rainbow. There's a huge lump & we were told to see a dentist if he did not feel better.
2 I've been here three times now. The first it was a quick in and out although the doctor was a tad perverted and began commenting on my girlfriends long tongue, I wanted to punch him in the throat. The 2nd time it took well over 2 hours to get in and out. And the third time they had her piss in a cup, and hold it in the LOBBY. One of the nurses told her to pee in the cup put it in the bag and bring it to the desk that a nurse will take it. Well she did that, and a nurse named Maria told her to sit down, wait and hold it. learn how to do your damn job maria. Shes also very rude and ignores people at the desk. Its taken us well over 2 hours to even see the doc. 4-7Pm in and out. This is no quick clinic. Go in at 1Am and it is. 4/9/14.
1 If your aim is to waste hours upon hours of your life (literally 2+) when you're very ill only to meet with a PA instead of a Dr. who insists on giving you nothing but over-the-counter meds, even after you call back and plead with him (ahem, Carlos Vasquez, PA-C), then this is the spot for you. Seriously, I've never been to a dirtier, less competent, more irksome place than Healthcare Partners Medical Group Urgent Care. I never take meds and was sick enough to really need them. This PA (who, btw, mispronounces his own name) is the least capable and sensitive person I've ever met. What a worthless facility and staff.
1 I have to write this review now because I've never seen anything like this place.  I'm here today, going on about 2 hrs, because my husband rolled his ankle on a sidewalk. This place is a zoo. I don't know if it's the only urgent care around or what, but there must have been about 20 people+ constantly sitting and/or coming through the door. The lobby is hot and stinks. Just feels so unsanitary! I had to use the restroom and that was a joyful experience as well. The lock on the door was broken and missing so you could get a nice peep show through the hole. Also there were wads of wet paper towels stuck to the walls. So disgusting.   After about an hour and 1/2 we get called back. I'm not sure if a doctor or an arnp saw my husband. She didn't introduce herself. Took about 5 min to examine his foot and ordered x-rays. That was fine with us. The quicker the better. But we sat for another 30 minutes waiting for x-rays. My husband is finally getting them done now so we'll see.   I can't imagine I need to say anymore then I have.  All I can say is this place is really unorganized and filthy. Not sure if the e.r is any better but it can't be any worse then this place.
