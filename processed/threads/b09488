5 I loved this place!  It's true here some things cost more than they do IN Mexico.  But, hey I got to save all that gas money or airfare by not having to cross the border.   I bought plates here. As well as crosses for my hyper-religious family.   All bases covered artfully and colorfully! Excellent!  I'd definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the Phoenix area!
4 This is a great place to get Mexican handicrafts at a very reasonable price and they have a nice selection.
