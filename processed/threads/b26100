4 Always good for a tasty, fully loaded sandwich :) This Subway is like other Subways, not a whole lot different. You chose the bread, then the meet, and then the other stuff, lettuce, tomato, peppers, onions, etc.
4 Meatball w pepperoni!!! Sandwiches are yummy, and the people are nice too. It's nice because it's right next to blockbuster! So u can get ur sandwich and movie and go!
5 Ever since I've moved to Vegas, I've been coming to this Subway a lot, now more than ever since I started Insanity. Definitely a great choice of place to eat at anytime, especially if your on that healthy tip. This location has great service and is open until midnight 7 days a week.
4 Whenever I feel like eating a healthy sub I come here and get my usual foot long turkey sub... every now and then I'll add some bacon ;) I don't know what it is about subways bacon but I just love their bacon over any other sub places.
4 I know, I know a review for Subway, come on.  But I have to say that the service at this subway is top notch.  The staff is very friendly and always goes out of there way to say hello.  It is highly appreciated.  The food is pretty standard Subway fare.  Not too much to say there, but I will be be back again on my lunch breaks.
