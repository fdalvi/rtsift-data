5 Zorfs has taken over Friends bar  Its owner Kenny has put new energy into this establishment  The music is great, brunches still superb, and the neighborly atmosphere out of this world  A patio is promised after cutting through the city's red tape  you'll love this place
3 Covered parking is a big plus!
5 A comfortable place.  They are really working to make it something special., and even willing to listen to input. The new patio is a great addition.  Some people will like some nights and events better than others of course, but it is a place to put on your "to go to" list.   And bring your dog.
4 Very friendly waitstaff as well as clientele.  Comfortable, clean, well done.  Thanks for a wonderful time.  Will be seeing you quite often.
2 When i went to the web site, i see a photo of an empty patio... that not really a selling feature, i hung out on the patio all night with a group of friends, the patio has this really weird giant tiki umbrella thats way to low, it either gets in your face or you can see across the patio. (we were all making jokes about how long it would take until someone sets it in fire)   The drinks were cheap so that was a plus.. and the bartenders were friendly even if he didn't know know to make the cocktail i ordered.   Not a visually appealing bar,  lots of wires all over the place, but its not a horrid place to get cocktails.
