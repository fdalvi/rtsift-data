3 So, I have only been here to watch the Battle of the Bands: A fight To Fame that my brothers band was participating in ( and won first place!! --sorry had to brag a little there..hehe). But, I never ate anything here that night. There is a dining area where the stage is, but for this event that whole room is full of ppl and the only place to eat is in the bar room, and that packed with ppl, and bartenders trying to fill drinks and orders and yeaaa, I wasn't in the mood to eat!   HOWEVER!, the place is decent looking and clean. It seems like a good place to have a drink after work or something. From what I heard that night, the nachos were pretty good. I don't know how good but i heard good things about it. I don't think this review would be too helpful, but I thought I'd just write one anyway! Sorry if I wasted your time :P lol
3 Good drink prices and a good layout that divides bar and showroom. The nachos are pretty decent too.
3 This is one of those places you drive past for years and keep saying one day I want to stop off and check the place out.  Well, that day (or night) finally happened.  But it took a Tower of Power tribute band named East Bay Grease to do it.    My girlfriend and I met our friends in the bar the night of 02/28/11.  The bartender was cute, friendly and promptly brought over our drinks.  My buddy ordered scotch on the rocks and though he didn't complain, the glass was 100% ice with very little scotch.  I ordered a beer - $3.50.  Noticing ash trays throughout the bar, I inquired whether or not cigar smoking was allowed.  I was informed yes by the bartender.  I took out my Arturo Fuente and lit up.  A few enjoyable puffs and 5 minutes later, I saw the familiar whispering and gesturing.  The bartender came over and told me she was just talking to the owner who said cigar smoking was NOT allowed.  Gee - that's why I asked first.  Interesting that the owner himself didn't come up to me.    Shortly before the band started to play, I asked the bartender to order us some spinach/artichoke dip with chips.  It never arrived.  I grew up listening to Tower of Power and I must say that this tribute band was spot on.  They played all my old favorites over the course of two sets.  I was totally surprised at the lack of people - I counted less than 20.  Despite the fact of the place being so cold inside, this was a totally enjoyable evening.  In my younger years, I used to frequent establishments like this all the time so it brought back some good memories.  I will also be on the lookout for more performances by East Bay Grease.  I noticed slot machines at the bar - but since they don't allow cigar smoking I'll have to gamble elsewhere.  But I will certainly return to watch more great music.
2 This season E String is promoting themselves as a Chicago Bears bar. I went last Sunday for season opener and they could not get game to stay on allegedly due to Direct TV. I called other bars in the area and the game was playing fine? The graveyard bartender who was getting off work seemed friendly. However, the rest of the staff and place seemed disorganized. It is too bad because I saw a number of customers who use to be regulars at Mugshots when they were a Bears bar. Anyway, I wasn't going to sit and wait to see if they ever got the game on and they seemed rather unapologetic about it and didn't even offer us any incentive to stay. I beat streets to watch the game elsewhere and have no intention of returning. The entrance to the place is pretty dirty which suggests the rest of the place is as well. Ultimately, It seems like they are running the place on a shoestring...name change? LOL.
3 The music/entertainment room here is fantastic. Food is kinda pricey and just EHHish. Drinks are average prices for the area, but the bartenders are cool and quick to take care of you.
2 I really wanted to like this place. after i had directed an acquaintance to check this place out one night a few weeks ago, based on his opinion, i decided to check out this place on a friday night. its location is like in the middle of a housing community. the place itself and the decor and theme is good. The bar walls reminded me of hard rock hotel with all the guitars hung up.   They had a live local rock band playing that night and of course i didn't know since it was my first time and just not even invited me. The place reaks of cigar and cigarette smell.. the place was stuffy so it didnt help the fact that i couldnt breathe. The place was real loud..   I would check this place out again if I went with a big group.. otherwise NO..
1 This is a hell hole!   I was in town visiting some friends and this is the place they decided to take me. I always forget that not all places are created equal, but I give everything a try. And try I did. A few things through me off...  -There were minors in the bar. The bartenders kept warning everyone that if they were underage to leave because the cops frequent the place. Shouldn't someone be checking IDs?  -I spent $7.00 on and order of fries. They weren't even a good size of fries and they were under cooked.  If you're going to charge me that much for an order of fries I need them to jump off the table and slap me because they are so good.  -The karaoke DJ was obnoxious! he catered to the staff at the bar and spent the other time being pushy about people tipping him.  I'm a good sport, but I'd rather ride the bench.
5 This place was a blast. I met up with a few of my colleagues on a Tuesday and this place rocked. Cute staff with great attitudes, drinks where brought out quickly (always a plus) and even the other patrons where all in high spirits. I will definitely go there again and recommend it to all my peers.
3 They have live music occasionally.  It's a small room so it's obviously various local acts.  I happened to see a beatles cover band composed of high school students.  They were pretty good actually.  The food I've seen is pretty sub par.  I got a pizza once, it was thin and greasy.  Hot wings were really wet if I recall correctly.  Don't go here for the food.  The bar is in a separate area, thus the show I went to was an all-ages show which is nice.  Even though I'm well over 21 years old, I remember when I wasn't.  Its a shame to miss out on music because others are drinking.
2 Hi, The place is full of attitude, bad attitude!  The Food is marginal at best and definitely NOT wort the trip just to eat.    At times the entertainment is good, Support your local Musicians.
4 Awesome chicken wings! I really like this place, karaoke every night. We went on a Wednesday and it wasn't to busy. Good service, would go back.
3 We came here for an event and my bestfriend and her band were performing for the first time EVAAAAAAAR!  It was super fun... The bar service was great and good prices on drinks, however the servers themselves were difficult to come by.  The mozzarella sticks were good too. :))
4 Went to check out Bruce Harper's Big Band.  What a treat!  16 piece big band full of professional players.  It's not often you get to hear this genre live and it's such a refreshing change from the Vegas Lounge cover band that uses backing tracks.  We'll be back to see this band for sure!  The place was understaffed so I wouldn't recommend going to one of these afternoon shows hungry - it was at least an hour wait for our meal and another 10-15 minutes waiting on the check.  The server was friendly and apologetic.
1 Worst experience ever. Went for a friends birthday for karaoke. The karaoke guy AC only ever played songs from his friends and never played anyone else! When you went to complain he had a bad attitude and was extremely rude!!! It would have been one thing if his friends were good singers with crowd pleaser songs BUT NO!! It was musical theater (hello Ms Saigon) and slow jams. I wanted to slit my wrists!!! Never again. If I could give it negative stars, I would. I'm also calling the manager to complain.
1 Stopped by for a drink and to check out the karaoke. The drinks were terrible. Out of the 7songs, 5 were Disney show tunes. It was like being in a kid's clubhouse. Not going back.
5 I love this place! Everyone, including the other guests, is so nice and welcoming.  I usually only go for karaoke, and my favorite DJ is AC. His nights are Wednesdays to Saturday's. I don't know what the other person is talking about, but when it gets really busy, the wait to sing a song can get up to over an hour. If you want to sing sooner, actually tip the dj. That's how the DJ makes money, and not many people tip well, so if you consistently tip nicely, you won't have to wait AS long as say the other people (like me) who don't tip at all. And don't be an ass. Assholes probably have to wait longer than everyone else.  I'm only saying all of this as someone who's lived in Vegas forever and actually understand that people are generally nicer to you if you're not an asshole and tip well.  Sonny, the bartender is awesome too. I only met Jenn once but she's sweet and she made this delicious drink that I drank for the rest of the night and then I got really drunk.  Fun times.
2 Maybe an off day, but the cooks need to learn how to cook. French fries are stale, burger undercooked.
