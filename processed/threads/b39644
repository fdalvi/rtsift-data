4 Big wheel, ice rink, plethora of stalls selling all things Christmas & liquid Christmas cheer. What's not to love about the Winter Wonderland. Yes, it's mobbed but surely that's the point.   There is a fair bit of repetition amongst the stalls but it's laid out better this year compared to last. I like the fact that the ice-rink is st the top & I much prefer the new style big wheel (pods to shelter in rather than being open to the elements).   A great way to while away a few hours with friends on a wintry afternoon.
