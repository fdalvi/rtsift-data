3 Umm, Ok its fast food three stars dare i give it four.  Midwest Does not Have the option for Jack-N-The Box, anyways i do have something to write home about,  Not to self the Jack-N-The Box Breakfast is not just served all day but great,  I'm sold by the little pancakes drenched in syrup then popped into my mouth. How fun.  Thanks Mr Jack-in-the Box I like the commercials.
5 I've been coming here for almost two years. The people who work the drive thru are always very nice. I used to work fast food when I was a teenager: I know how AWFUL drunk customers (sober ones too!) can be so I'm all the more impressed that the crew of this store has such dignity and poise. Bravo.  The food is always made when I order it, so my burgers and fries are hot and tasty.   Living around the corner has its perks, so I'll be back.  Thank you to everyone at this store for awesome service!
1 The ladies that were working today Were almost skeptical after I used 2 coupons like the coupons were Fake or something so this is where My issue is  1 uninformed employees 2 as I ordered they never asked    Was there anything else so they    Just kept telling me the price when     I wasn't done ordering  3 They didn't bother to ask me was it for    Here or to go until they had it all together 4 just all around inept customer service
