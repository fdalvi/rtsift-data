5 Yay this is my favorite tanning spot! Super clean, located in nice area, clean and comfortable atmosphere.  All the girls that work here are awesome! Always very helpful and informative. They set me up with a great membership and matched me up with the best lotion for me. There's great lotion selection, top of the line brands. Best tan for your money compared to other tanning salons. Love how there's 12 valley locations so I can tan close to home and close to work. I wouldnt tan anywhere else! Loveee it!!
2 Purchased a groupon for a mystic tan at this location. Upon arrival I was informed of the groupon only being for the 'glow' option which isn't an actual tan. if you want color, it was an additional $5 plus the optional enhancer for $5. Since this information wasn't in the offer, I only rated 2 stars. Even when I expressed dissatisfaction, the employee passed the buck as it wasn't in her control. No apology or accountability. I don't know if I would come back? We'll see how the tan turns out...
5 I purchased a groupon for 3 mystic tans or unlimited UV tanning for a month for 24 bucks witch is a pretty good deal. The girl was really nice and helpful. Groupon doesn't do tax so make sure to bring like a few bucks to pay that. But other then that I like the place. The Unlimited UV tanning is  a level 1 lay down bed but she explained to me I can upgrade my whole package for a higher level bed i could for so much more or if I want to upgrade a level bed for a day I can for a few bucks more. :) I like it there and I will go back again. And with the mystic she explained to me about what it does and how it works as well as the colors that come along with it.
