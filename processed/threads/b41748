5 I have reviewed this gym at the N. Scottsdale location and the new Tempe location is definitely up to par! Great spot right off the highway and easy to find.   This one isn't as booked as the Scottsdale classes because it's brand new. It's still just as great for me because I thoroughly enjoy the workouts I get from Jabz. However, I'll be really excited when there are more girls coming in because it's a great motivator with other chicks who are looking to get in shape and kick some butt!   It's basically a VERY CHALLENGING circuit training with new exercises every visit. Keeps things fun and exciting so that you actually look forward to your workouts. I get bored so damn easy this is quite important for me.  Don't expect to come out feeling anything other than "man, I got my ass kicked". Len and the other trainers will work you and encourage you to do your best!   Ladies, don't be intimidated by my ass kicking remarks. It's fabulous. And your progress shows that. As I said, they're great motivators so I'm sure you will find you really enjoy it. I purchased visits on groupon and just stuck with it since.   Victory is mine!
5 I took classes at the Scottsdale location about a year ago and was thrilled when they opened a location in Tempe where I live.  I love the variety of the workout and the instructors are very helpful and encouraging.  The time just flies by during the workout.  I also like that they have a warm up routine and a stretch afterwards.   Don't be afraid to try this even if you haven't worked out in awhile or you passed being a "20 something" a long time ago.  You will be amazed with the results
