1 Horrible horrible service
1 My daughter went for an oil change, 2004 Chevy Trailblazer, charged her $41.00 for a $15.00 job.  Then proceeded to tell her that the serpentine belt was so bad she shouldn't drive more than 10 miles on it.  They would gladly change it for her for $100.  I got a Dayco belt at Autozone and changed it in five minutes at a cost of $35.  They were looking at up to more than $65 for labor. (that calculates to $780 an hour for labor) and you know they get Jobber price on the belt so pay less than I did.
2 40 minutes for an oil change and then a hard up sell at the end.  At least they vacuumed my carpets.
5 Went in for an oil change and was in and out in 20 min which was impressive since they had to go get the right fuel filter for my  car. They also did an excellent job cleaning up my messy interior. I really liked the fact that they weren't pushy and didn't try to sell me on anything unnecessary. I'll definitely go back
