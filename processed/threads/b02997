4 Very patient and nice. Some of their jewelry is affordable for the common person. I bought my girlfriend a necklace, a ring, and earrings there. Each time, I had great customer service.
5 Very welcoming, warm and patient. Always with a smile and helpful. Keeps you informed on the updates and try their best to get what you want. Loved it and would prefer always shopping with them first!
1 I unfortunately purchased my fianc√©'a engagement ring here 6 months ago. I have had to send it for repair 3 times. There is a woman who works there with a very heavy accent who should never work in a position which is customer facing. She is rude, accusatory and unhelpful. This situation alone was bad enough. I didn't need to horrible service too.
1 This location hates to do returns of their merchandise. Purchased from their online site, had original receipt. Customer service was terrible and they tried to refund less than what I actually paid for the merchandise.  Additionally they made me wait 30 minutes for a manager to try and help me out.
