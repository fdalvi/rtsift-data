5 I am so happy to see All About Hair in Yelp. I have been going to Stephanie the wonder nail tech for nearly 6 years. She makes my fingers and toes sparkle and I alway get compliments on them! Thanks Stephanie!
5 Not your typical "salon" experience.  They do have a full service hair salon, but there is also a nail tech station up front.  Guys, this is a privately owned salon where you will never question the licensing, staffing, or cleanliness. Make an appointment to see Stephanie (the Nail Dr.) and you'll know what I mean! She does NOT CHARGE to remove old gel--I really appreciate knowing this, as other salons will tack on $5-$10 for removal...which is stupid.  She also offers mobile appointments for a fee...I'm thinking bachelorette party!
