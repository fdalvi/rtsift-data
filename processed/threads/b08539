5 I love the staff and the work that they do.  They are friendly and enjoy their customers.  Plus, they take their time and do a really good job on my nails.  I enjoy the pedicure a lot.  However, I just wish they would get hot stones....then it would make it 110%!
2 It is just ok. They do a ok job with the pedicure. But they don't have any ideas for nail art. There are just two nail technicians out here. So on the plus side, there is not much wait time and they do a good foot massage.
4 I have gone to Andy's nails twice to get my nails done, and a few other times to accompany friends. The place is clean and smells good (no overpowering nail-polish smell), and they are always on top of everything. Even if you had no appointment you will still be taken care of fairly quickly. I have gotten acrylic nails done here twice now, and I was completely happy both times. My only complaint at all is that they are a tad bit overpriced. Other than that they are great, they have a TV to watch while you're waiting or sitting getting a mani/pedi, the staff is talkative so it isn't awkward just sitting there, and the atmosphere is good. They are convenient for the people who live near Gilbert/Riggs because they are the only nail place close by. I recommend them.
