4 I come in the evening and the crew is always so welcoming. They take the time to know the customers, though at times they get real busy but they keep that smile on their face. The place is small and is not like other places but the crew makes me want to come back even if its just to sit down and chat.
3 Not a big fan but Tax free yeah!  Off base has more selection and you can find deals. Unless your buying a high price item i would shop elsewhere. The lines get bad so don't be in a rush.
3 Small Starbuck's franchise right next to the entrance to the Main Exchange. Friendly staff who make terrific lattes. Place is small with a couple tables but always clean. Rest rooms are in the corridor a couple doors from the Starbuck's.  See you there sometime?
5 Our Baristas rock , we love to put a smile on your face when you come in try our new drink Vanilla Macchiato  , creamy milk with the silky vanilla sauce topped with fresh brewed espresso shots can't get better that this so common by !
