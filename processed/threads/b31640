4 At first, I wasn't sure whether I'd like having a Walgreens at this location, in front of Trader Joes.  Today, I visited it for the first time, and now I can see myself picking up a few things here each week after my Trader Joes run.  The store was clean (it better be, though, it was brand new), they had what I was looking for (bags of ice), and the cashier was friendly.  That's about all I can ask for.
4 Very non ghetto :-) Okay to leave gat in the RIZIDE!
4 Welcome to one of my favorite shopping centers Walgreens! This is a great location for this drug store. I can't count the number of times I was shopping at Trader Joes and wished there was a drug store near by to grab some last minute essentials. Luckily, the drug store elves heard my wishes and opened up this location! It's your typical Walgreens with all the basic needs, but I like it!
3 Located near J Alexanders and Blanco, I drop in here from time to time when I'm on my lunch hour.  If you're dining at one of those places, it's very convenient.  It can get crowded in the parking lot though.  However, it's in a great location and very clean.  Return Factor - 80%
