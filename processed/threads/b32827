5 Ok, the hours are bad.  But everything else is great.  The baristas are friendly (and attractive).  The coffee is the best I've had since Cuba - this includes other Balzacs locations.  Always a cool techie Tannery crowd, and usually dece music.  Plus its got decor like a Parisian coffee shop.  Like all their locations, Balzacs at the Tannery shines.
5 Amazing coffee and excellent service! Jessica the barista does amazing coffee art!
5 Been here many times. Excellent coffee, and great place to chill or do work. Service has always been good in my experience.
2 Underwhelming. Coffee is bitter and not that hot. Music blaring over the speakers, drowning out all conversation (it's sunday morning, for petes sake - read your customer base). Small, uncomfortable tables. Crap wifi connection. Won't be back.
2 The date squares are really great, but the barista serving gave me attitude for listening to Beyonc√©. Maybe she's too mainstream for him, but you know who else was mainstream back in the day? Balzac was. There is no need to be pretentious. Again the food is really great but the staff needs a lesson in customer service.
