1 This is the nastiest apartment complex known to man! Some apartments have ten residents living in a 2 bedroom 2 bath apartment. There has been mold growing and the maintenance takes days, if not weeks, to repair things such as water heaters. During the summer you will notice that uninvited guests move in, the cockroaches (no, not your in laws- actual cock roaches). Neighbors are known to dumpster dive in the unsecured dumpster areas, so hide and shred all confidential information! There have been shootings on the property. Save you money and don't ever ever move in here! They should rename this place Villiage Idiot apartments, if you walk around this place you'll know why.
2 I lived here in 2002/2003.  What I liked?  Location.  Lovely location -- easy access to all of NW vegas.  What I disliked?  Roaches everywhere inside the apartment -- so much so that me and my partner got used to them.  My cat loved playing with them, so I guess that was an upside.  At night, prostitutes frequented the property -- especially the mail room.  The tenants seem to have endless kids living in two bedroom units.  When we travel back to vegas, we often check in with Sundance Village.  Over the years since we've lived there -- they have painted and updated the exteriors.  So that is nice.  But unless they have rid the place of endless roaches...and not-so-hot prostitutes -- i wouldn't suggest living here.  But then again, it is a decent part of town -- and we were never vandalized while living here....so go for it...and you can find out yourself.
1 I've never lived at Sundance, but my job takes me into this complex nearly daily and all I can say is, avoid living here. I'll keep it brief because I would simply be echoing the other two reviews. I would gladly sleep in the bed of my truck before I ever slept a night in this complex.
