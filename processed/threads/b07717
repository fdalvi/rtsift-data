2 I have to agree with Shane on this particular location......I have been to several Jack in the box's in Cali.....and this one is awful compared to those. The place is always dark, dank and dirty looking. The service is always slow......however the staff is friendly. I highly recommend the drive thru because it seems they concentrate on that pretty heavy so you should get your food faster. However the milkshakes are the one bright spot here....since they are made to order they are very fresh and delicious. Everything else however is just average.....and unless you just like Jack in the box....there are several better places to eat nearby. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!
4 I am not a fan of Jack in the Box. But every time I go to this one the drive-thru is fast and friendly and my food is always hot or cold as appropriate.
3 Had a breakfast sandwhich and it was good.  The drive-through customer service was a couple of notches above what you'd expect- great attitudes, helpful, and cheerful.  Jack knows how to hire and retain a crew.  Food it typical Jbx.
4 Stopped by this location for a large order of jalapeno bites and a few sodas. Went through the drive-thru and the employees were extremely friendly, quick, and accurate on the requested condiments, right amount of napkins, and the poppers cooked just right.
