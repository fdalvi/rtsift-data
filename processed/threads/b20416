4 I first discovered Thomas Pink a few years ago when I was graduating the first time around. It was expensive then, but that purchase is still in my wardrobe after being rediscovered, tags on (decided to wear a dress to graduation instead) when I was moving.  I was in search of the perfect white shirt. I have few occasion's these days where I need to be suited and booted but it does happen.  The prices are steep but you do get amazing quality shirts. I couldn't find the white shirt I wanted (I had something specific in mind and I couldn't justify spending £99 on the almost perfect shirt) but had I a different colour in mind then I would have been spoiled for choice.   Thomas Pink still managed to part me from my cash as I found a gorgeous stripy shirt. If like me, you need the occasional formal shirt then the sale items are fab! My purchase was £79 originally and I paid £29 and will be great as a semi-formal or more casual piece.  A great shop if you are looking for business wear that makes an impression and it is a great investment. I did look at the other shirt shops in George St, but to they weren't in the same class as Thomas Pink.
