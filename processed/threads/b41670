5 Roger has been coloring/highlighting/cutting my hair for two years now, and I cannot imagine using anyone else! He is absolutely incredible at his craft, and a true hair artist.
5 Roger IS as good as it gets!   I've been seeing him exclusively for a couple years now and have followed him to several salons. He's always bent over backwards to accommodate my husband and I and he's super freakin talented with hair and color.   Roger is also really great at fixing my "errors in judgement" such as: botched Great Clips "bangs", that time I tried to dye my hair brown and it turned green, that other time when I did the same thing, and recently when I dyed my hair a decent color, but it was fading super fast.   He's super fair with rates, and when you're a repeat customer he will hook you up.   Put simply, Roger Montoya is the illusive chanteuse of hair.
5 I love Roger! I've been a super big fan of his for a couple years now. I've previously reviewed other salons solely based on on Roger's work.  His work is impeccable and we've been working the last year to grow out and repair the damage I did when I let someone else touch my locks.  I love the Hair Studio where he's set up his own little spot now. It's a great location in the camelback corridor.  I'll follow Roger anywhere. Except maybe Siberia. I hate Siberia. I guess I could visit but I wouldn't want to live there.   If you bring him a caramel frap, he'll love you forever.
