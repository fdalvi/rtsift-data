3 When I first came back from Korea, the transition of my funds was my main priority. They were very straight forward in handling my concerns in a quick manner. The only objections I had was the lack of upfront answers when it came to my questions about investment options. I sat in the office for almost two hours getting noncommittal responses to my concerns. I got these from a teller and not a banker, but it made me wonder why they had this person deal with my case. The banker eventually came and handled the rest of the process.   Sometimes this branch can be very crowded because it is a small facility located on the side of the Vons.
5 With all the hostility held towards banks now-a-days, this branch has been nothing but accommodating and friendly. My initial review was lackluster due to how long I was held up. Even the initial teller was nice, so their willingness to aid was not the issue.  Now that I have frequented this branch a few more times, they have become accustomed to me, they are able to assess my needs in a more timely fashion. Like a bonehead, I misplaced my debit card and had to get it replaced. Danelle made it painless. She also assured me that if I found any unusual purchases made, I can report it to be investigated and get a refund. I like walking into a place, not care who I get, and leave not feeling like a number.
5 Been with this location for the past seven years and can say nothing but good things about this place.  It used to be located inside vons, but they recently move in 2013 to a open spot next to it. Their customer service is always on point and I'm always greeted with smiles. And if I ever need to deposit or ask questions about my account I never really wait long to get to the teller or representative.
