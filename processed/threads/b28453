5 Eero & Riley is a brilliant little shop. As it's en route to town for me, it's the first place I head to whenever I need to find a card or gift and I never leave empty handed; there's always something lovely to buy.  Gifts range from handmade jewellery & bags to tableware, baby toys to toiletries and I've noticed that in recent weeks the range of men's gifts has grown too.  Favourite recent purchases include a cute set of Russian doll thank you cards, a silver bird wine stopper and white petal candle holders. There's always something new to look at whenever I visit - great that in such a small space the range of things to buy always stays interesting.  The shop is ideal for anyone who lives in the Abbeyhill / Hillside / Easter Road area of the city and I highly recommend popping in before heading to the chain stores in the centre of town next time you're looking for a gift.
5 Just the best local shop you could imagine or ask for. Suzanne is so helpful and interested in her customers. She quickly gets to know her regulars and makes the effort to have special events for them with glasses of fizz and previews of new stock. Whether its cutesie baby gifts, lovely art work or scented candles you want, this is somewhere not to be missed!
