4 3 for $3 Deal rocks as do the new drinks, I loved the 50/50, half lemonade, half iced tea.  The husband enjoyed his cherry lemonade too.  Watch out though they do charge an extra $.50 cents per hot dog to add cheese.  This was a great little snack after a long tough day of outlet shopping.  Oh and their fries are right up there with McDonalds, Yum!
4 These hot dogs are awesome, and at an awesome price too! I got the number 1 that had two chili dogs, a drink (pepsi) and french fries for $5. The hot dogs are nice and juicy and the chili is good too. You simply just cannot go wrong when you eat here. I am always looking forward to going to Vegas just to eat my Weinerschnitzel before I go back home. They don't only have hot dogs, but they have burgers and other things too. I think that their food is great and wish they had one here in Hawai.
4 It's a great place to stop by if you are in town and looking for a quick bite, either before or after you go shopping at the adjacent mall.  Parking can be tight around lunch time & requires a little bit of prowling the lot.  Prices are reasonable, service is quick & there are some interesting drinks available. What's not to iike?!  Definitely gonna keep an eye out for one of these on future trips when I'm looking for a quick bite to eat.
5 Owners were very cool after our order got mixed up.  Thanks for Great service you usually don't see that in a fast food place.
