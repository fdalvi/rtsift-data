5 FANTASTIC place to take a class on a field trip.  My 5th graders were absolutely loving all of the interactive displays that they have.  Their docents are friendly and knowledgeable as well.  My students were encouraged to ask questions and just have fun!
5 When I can take my students on a field trip and not worry about a thing, I am in teacher heaven!  On top of that, the ladies and gentleman who work with our students are incredibly knowledgeable, professional, and don't mind putting behavior issues to rest when they arise.   Everything is very well organized for all involved.  Every time I have been now, the parents and other teachers can't thank me enough for setting this field trip up.  Most importantly, the kids absolutey eat everything up.  Their recent remodel has definitely taken an already great place and turned it into something even bigger and better.  Thank you Halle Heart Center!
5 This is one of the most unknown treasures in Phoenix ... And is a wonderful educational experience for children. This well thought out exhibit has extensive hands-on activities to engage kids physically and mentally. Lots of time and money was invested in this exhibit, so be sure and leave a nice donation so AHA can maintain the quality of the experience. Just minutes from Sky Harbor, the Phoenix Zoo, Tempe, and several major freeways... This is not to be missed.
