5 I've used these guys a couple time. First was when I was leaving my old apartment. They made it look like new, I feel better paying them than some apartment company. I used then again in my new place to clean the stairs. Made them look beautiful!! Guys are really cool, they get everything done quick.
1 My husband and I used this company for a move-out clean of our flooring.  The price was right, however we had left a few items in the house that mysteriously became misplaced after we left.  My husband confronted them, and they stated that they had never seen the items in question.  As they were the only people with access to the house, my husband told them that we would not pay for the service unless the items were returned.  The man still denied seeing the items, and they ended the call.  Immediately after, the man called back saying that his partner had seen the items, thought they were trash, and threw them out.  This is an outright lie.  They had to reason to mess with the items as they weren't even on the floor.  And there were several hangers still left that were next to the items that were stolen.  If you thought they were trash, you would have taken the hangers out as well.  Anyway, this company is VERY sketchy, and I would never recommend them to anyone.  Maybe if you were there to supervise the entire job?
5 I was in despair, my carpet was a wreck, a friend had told me about No Gamble Carpet Cleaning and said they were amazing. So I decided to try them out. I was very happy with my end result. My carpet looked new again!! I entertain a lot of guests so having a very clean and tidy house means a lot to me. I will most definitely be calling them again!!
