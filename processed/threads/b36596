5 Just had a super lunch at Hernandez & Co, although not strictly an eat-in establishment there are a few counter stools where you can quite comfortably settle-in.  On offer are a wonderful range of sandwiches and rolls filled with quality Spanish ingredients, omelettes, peppers, Manchego cheese, Serrano ham, olives, tuna etc - it was REALLY difficult to choose, no matter, gives me a good excuse to go back!  The chorizo and black pudding soup was fabulous and they make a mean Machiato.  Price-wise it hits the spot too - soup from £1.50, my baguette (packed with anchovies, Manchego, Serrano ham & tomatoes) was £3.00c and the coffee £1.30
5 REEEEEAAAAALLY nice coffee! I was here the other week and just found my drafted review waiting for me. Well so whats up here? Spanish place, Spaniards knows how to make coffee and Hernandez one of them. Spanish deli on sandwiches is always a hit for a party in my mouth. Yep, a back goer indeed!
5 I'm a LITTLE bit of a Spanglophile... let's just say that first.   Unsurprisingly, I love the shit out of this place.  But wait, the coffee is under £2, so there's that.   They have Spanish tortilla sandwiches and MANCHEGO to die for. They have stuffed olives with anchovies and then... as you know from my reviews I am a hater on Edinburgh for the LACK OF SALADS.   Here, they have the all amazing and life sustainingly effing wonderful - ensaladas... which and I can tell you from experience... ain't so findable in Espana. The salads are so perfectly veggie filled and meat/fish/cheese/egg filled that you are left feeling like you can eat an entire Dairy Milk Oreo bar.
