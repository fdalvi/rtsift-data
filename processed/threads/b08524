4 Taco Bell... I favor the #7 and #8. Sometimes with nachos, sometimes with a burrito. However, a #8 with a burrito is like 1375 calories if you choose soda with your included drink. I think it's worth it sometimes... Other times I shudder the thought.
4 We got there at 9:59 and they still let us come in and eat indoors even though they had already mopped the place.  Good food...it's Taco Bell, and the staff was cool. Had never had the dorito taco, so i got the $5 combo box with that, a burrito and another regular taco.  Was good.  I was expecting more from the dorito taco tastewise, but it didn't taste bad or anything.
1 This location is a major disappointment. Today they forgot my order of cheesy fiesta potatoes, didn't provide napkins, and sloppily prepared the rest of my order. The staff employee at this location was also very rude when the mistake was brought to her attention. No apology whatsoever. The location on Val Vista and Baseline is worth the few extra minutes of travel time because they take orders accurately, are friendly, and their food tastes better.
