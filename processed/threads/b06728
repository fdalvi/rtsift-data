5 Very easy to deal with, I did research and they do pay the highest in town.  Another place was going to pay me a 10K price for dental gold, where Rick paid for 18K.  Very honest, friendly, and fun shop to look around in.  I will go back, even to buy jewelry.
5 From the outside, you'd never guess how much this place holds. It's a modern-day Olde Curiosity Shop. I could spend hours just looking at stuff, and they have several unique and functional pieces I plan to add to my collection over the next year or so! Prices are fair, staff and management exceptional and friendly, it's a great little Willy St shop.
5 Love Ricks. He has a great selection and saves antique jewelry! If you are planning to look at pawn shops for antiques or jewelry definitely stop in to Ricks. Just beware that Rick does have a slightly condescending personality but he's really a sweetheart. Planning on buying my engagement ring here that is original from the 30s. Can't wait! Excellent prices, like a ring with over a carat for under 2K excellent.
