5 We highly recommend Tranquility Ponds to anyone. Our friends had them build their pond over 5 years ago so when we were finally ready we went with Tranquility. The staff was a pleasure and very knowledgeable.
5 We had Tranquility rebuild our pond and we are more than impressed by their service, caring attitude.  They did a fantastic job and even stepped above and beyond with their terrific advice on landscaping and updating various areas of our yard.  Their crews were on time (unheard of for most contractors) each day and simply a pleasure to work with.  We would recommend them for anyone looking to build or update a pond.
5 Tranquility Ponds  designed and built my pond several months  ago I couldn't be happier.  The pond  is gorgeous, everything is in perfect working order and the filter keeps the water crystal-clear. The crew showed up on time every day-by the way, the temperature was 117Â° all three days they worked  last summer. I have a triple waterfall and the pond is 3 feet deep, stocked with 6 Koi fish and 2 Red Eared Slider turtles.  They were able to incorporate three large boulders and a massive Mexican fan palm into the design so it  looks like they  always intended to be there.  I had no intentions of having fish or turtles but after talking to Daniel the supervisor,   I decided to give both a try. Best thing I ever did.   I had the crew come back and landscape the rest of my yard to follow the design of the pond and I can't tell you how beautiful my yard is  for the first time since I moved in 14 years ago.  I highly recommend Tranquility Pond and if you're thinking at all of installing  a backyard pond my recommendation is to go for it.
