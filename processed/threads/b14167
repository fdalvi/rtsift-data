5 Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.  The staff is outstanding and really hustles.  When you walk in the door they dish out a "hi, welcome to Subway".  If there's any kind of a wait, even just one person ahead of you, they will let you know they'll be with you in a minute.  The bread is always fresh, no exceptions.  Been to many Subways where it's obvious the bread is a couple days old.  If you're ever in the area you can't go wrong stopping at this Subway.  It really is better.

4 Have to say that I am pleasantly surprised at how good the Subways in this area are to grab lunch in!  Stopped in here to grab a quick lunch and strayed from my usual Subway so that I could run into Ross in the same plaza.    I ordered the 6" meatball sub on wheat and it tasted exactly the way I wanted it to and the bread was definitely made fresh.  I also did the meal combo deal with cookies instead of the chips and they were baked fresh and tasted yum as well!  Overall: A If I head in their direction to do any quick errands on lunch I'll definitely snatch up a meal here cause I know it's tasty!
