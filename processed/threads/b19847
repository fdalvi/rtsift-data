4 Despite a very short working relationship with the Citrus Club ( I worked there for a night) I quite like this club, which is in small cul de sac just off Lothian Road.   My interview with the owner was more of a friendly chat than an intimidating interrogation, and I gathered that the club is probably one of the oldest in Edinburgh! Today, the bar area is quite modern looking, and leads to a garage-like dancefloor with dj booth intact. However, it's changed along with the many fads and trends of the decades; at one point all the walls were white; it's difficult to imagine how practical a white walled nightclub could have been!  The club is currently only open on Friday and Saturday nights, but they're planning to introduce a dubstep Thursdays theme. I worked there on a Saturday, and sitting on my throne (in the cloak room) I really enjoyed the indies mix of music, which the DJ puts together himself.   I'd recommend it for a relaxed/casual night out, as it's quite laid back compared to some of the other clubs in Edinburgh.
2 I had one truly hilarious night in the Citrus Club. It was one of the most memorable nights in Edinburgh. Why only 2* then? Well, because it's utter utter s***e. Funny though.  A group of four of us went in first year, hearing it was this cool little indie/alternative venue. Basically, us arriving (and it was about half 12, normal club arriving time) doubled the clientèle. Ha, clientèle. Anyway, the bar staff were rude - they didn't want to be there either.  But we thought we might as well make a night of it. So we totally dominated the dance floor. You know, like those horrible, awful guys you see in clubs that you instantly hate. That was us. But we were those only ones on there. In fact, my friends got so carried away they were asked to leave. "Really?! There's no one in here!". So we left. And we've never been back. It was a very funny night, but, please, don't ever go.
1 No....just no!!!   Only redeeming feature is the curly wurly they give you!   Ridiculously over priced drinks for sub standard house labels behind the bar!   Dank, smelly, full of people who look like they may have crawled out from under a rock!   ......No!   Dear Owner, No confusion, you must add on a hefty whack for mixer then! All i know is your staff were charging more than £4 for vodka mix last Friday!
4 I used to shiver at the thought of going to Citrus, but now I've come to accept it, for what it is... A grungy, dirty black pit with good tunes!  Second to GoGo at Studio 24, it's probably the only club you can go to for good indie or retro soul music.    Upon entering you faced with the bar selling a range of drinks, but they are pretty dear.  Further into the club you can find a cloak room and lime green toilets opposite. At the end of the warren is the black pit.  A dance floor on two levels and the DJ in the far corner.  There is no fine design or luxury here, it's concrete floors and black walls.  Basic and no nonsense.  I guess that's why people come here, for the music and to dance.  It's not full of stilettos, fake tan, male peacocks and George Street naff, it's good honest friendly people having a drink, dancing like no ones watching and having a good time!   Just don't wear your good shoes here though, the dance floor is usually covered in spilt drink from too much shape cutting!
