5 I'm the second to write a review.   My experience is the opposite.   I've been taking my Seitz Tzu for years starting in 2005.  I could not get in there until summer after the snowbirds left.  They have had great groomers, and not so great.  I know they have had a turn over, and I think I know why.   Tips are an important part of the groomers pay.   In Sun City West, were they are located, will not tip.  I usually tip $5.00 to groomer and $5.00 to bather.   The last time I was there my budget was was short, I apologized that $2.00 each is all I could give.   They were delighted with my tip, telling me how bad it was.    Groomers make more tips outside of Sun Cities.   This explains why it coast so much at Grand Grooming, they have to keep raising their fees to keep the good groomers, as will as rising expenses.  I have wondered why it is so easy now to get an appointment.  I used to have to make appointments weeks in advance, now it is 1 to 2 days.   I blame NOT Grand Grooming owner, but her customer bass.  If each of them could cough up $2.00 ($1.00 ea.), or $4.00 (better), good groomers would probably stay.      Granting what the gentle man said is true, no matter ware you go you take a chance.  Grand Grooming management dose care, that is very important.  I have no problem in sending friends to them, nor suggesting they leave a tip.  Help them keep good groomers, by tipping and knowing your groomer.  I used the same person for years, I now know why she is not there any longer.
