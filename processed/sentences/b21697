Finally, we have an Armani Exchange in the valley!
This one is a little small in comparisons to other locations, but not bad overall.
The employees are very nice & always willing to help with sizes & other options.

Poor selection compared to the counterpart in Union Square in San Francisco.
It's a decent store but it's stocked with low-end clothing which is odd for Armani.
Employees here are yes, attractive, but unhelpful and disregarding.
I don't know why I always go in here, I never find anything.

The music is so uncomfortably loud that you can hardly talk to a sales person or even think.
The selection was so poor compared to what was on the website and the quality is slipping like many other stores.
The male sales associate who was supposed to be checking sizes for me periodically just abandoned me to chat up his coworkers at the retail counter.
When I mentioned there have may been something else I wanted to try but got tired of dressing and undressing each time I wanted to find something and he actually was rude enough to suggest I just didn't remember the (one) time he let me know the size wasn't in the store.
Horrible place for SFSM and never again will I step into the worst headache of my shopping experiences.
