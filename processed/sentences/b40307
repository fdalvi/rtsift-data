Linda is an awesome yoga teacher who truly understands the physical, mental, and emotional combination that is Yoga.
She is knowledgeable, informative and a beautiful all around person.
I never felt alone or like a newbie in her classes.
Linda welcomed me to the class personally, asked how she could be of service, and then presented an awesome class.
Truly one of the best studios you will find.

Wonderful studio!
Took my daughter here for a kids class and she loved it!
Very calming and welcoming atmosphere and I plan on coming here for a class myself!
It's so nice to have a yoga studio out in Queen Creek now!

Went for my first ever yoga studio session and it was very welcoming.
The class I attended was not overfilled, and the staff was very supportive.
She knew I was new and talked me through the moves to make sure I was on track, and when she noticed I was keeping up she backed off the explanations.
It was a really great experience and I will definitely be considering it my personal studio!
