We had our 1st Quarter All-Hands meeting in the Smith Center (which was just lovely) then had a gorgeous happy hour in Symphony Park.
I had never been to this area and was so pleasantly surprised to see such lush green beauty inside of this wonderful desert city.
I loved the space, the gorgeous artwork and statues and how food trucks will pull up to provide you with delicious nourishment.

beautiful spot for a picnic.
They also have music playing and its a great well groomed space.
If the weather is right I can only imagine how much fun could be had here!
They do concerts here and it seems like a perfect spot for an outdoor concert.
Everything associated with the smith center always stuns me, and Symphony park is no different!

Came here for the 4th of July Philharmonic fireworks.
While we loved the fireworks display, it happened 30-35 later than the advertised time.
Too hot to be waiting outside.
Hopefully they work out the kinks for next year's show.
