I had an excellent experience with Congress and will 100% use them next time I sell.
This is a pretty straightforward service; they put my house on the MLS and it basically sold itself because all the agents could find it.
I had a For Sale sign outside and did some marketing on my own (Craigslist, etc.
), but 9 out of 10 of phone calls were from agents.
I have sold houses before and did not need much help to begin with, but at the same time had no problem reaching someone on the phone or via email throughout the listing for the rare occasion that I needed something.

These guys are great- I needed an MLS listing fast, and competing services needed several days- Congress Realty had my MLS listing up the same day!
Andrew English was very responsive, that it was lest expensive than Owners.com and others was icing on the cake.
Thanks!

Easy to list, very helpful, used them twice and had no issues.
