Great people, great skills.
Fellas check it out.

I absolutely love my new hair do!
Jessica is the absolute best!
After only going to her twice now, she knew how to cut and style my hair so it wouldn't be too difficult and take too much of my time to style it.
When I left her salon, it looked fabulous.
The trick is when I style it, will it look as fabulous as when she did it?
The answer, it absolutely does look fabulous!
Plus, she gives the most amazing head washes ever!
I was really spoiled by my last gal in Vegas as she did the best head washes and I just couldn't find the right person here in AZ for the past 7 years until now!
Please go see Jessica at the Luxxi Salon!
She is truly a hair artist!

Sarah Alexander at Luxxi Salon is just perfect!
Another great haircut!
No explaining, she just knows style.
She is on the cutting edge of fashion and just has the eye and know how.
The price is so great!
You have to experience it to believe, this type of service you would expect to be over charged, not at Luxxi, not with Sarah Alexander.

Wow!!!
I was referred to Luxxi salon because I was new to town and wanting a salon with Knowledgable stylist and that's exactly what I found.
I am very picky about my color and Extentions and Jill, the owner did an awesome job listening to exactly what I wanted.
She picked a color that was just the right about of change I wanted and the Extentions were put in to perfection!!!
I'm addicted to Luxxi Salon now for all my hair needs.
Thank you Jill!

Love, love, love my experience here.
Jill was great and did my hair perfectly.
Very reasonably priced which allows for a more generous tip.
Can't wait to go back!
