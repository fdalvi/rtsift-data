I've been here twice and Dr. Curtis is great at what he does.. staff is friendly and professional.
I had some problems with my nails and he excellent took care of them.
Highly recommended if you have any problems with your feet!

Dr. Newswander is the best!
I have visited this office for sports injuries,  broken toes, and a variety of other issues, and I love the care I've received.
The staff is always professional and committed to their work.
Dr. Newswander definitely cares about me and my health, and is always willing to hear and answer my questions.
I always recommend him to my family and friends, and my sister started seeing him too, for her foot pain.
She loves her orthodic inserts, they've helped her a ton.
He is great with children, too.

I was a patient for about 6 years, however today was the last time I will deal with them.
BDr.is ok, however the staff is very rude.
I had an issue with their rudeness last year too, but I chose to let it go.
Not this year.
Two years in a row is simply an indication that they just don't care.
Take your business somewhere else.
I will.

Had been to this office several years ago when it had a different office name.
The dr and office was great.
This time I gave up after the 3 time in.
They had charged my insurance for work they did not provide, the charges had about doubled, the two girls at the front desk are an embarrassment to the office as they giggle and appear to make fun of their patients, hiding their faces in shame after getting caught laughing hysterically at a patient.
All I got from this apt was a bill, anger and humiliation and have not been back.
I had previously recommended the dr but no longer will.
