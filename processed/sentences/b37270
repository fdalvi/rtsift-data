Friendly people, but unreliable.
I selected Brothers Cleaning Services from Craig's List to clean a recently vacated house on the east side of Las Vegas on 12/17/12.
Workers did not bring step ladder to the house, so they could not clean all ceiling fans as I requested.
Workers also slightly damaged 2 window blinds.
I had to clean ceiling fans myself and fix the slightly damaged window blinds.
I emailed bro.services702@gmail.com but only got a vague reply and no follow-up.
This was an unpleasant customer service experience to say the least.

Just hired Brother's Cleaning as per a friend's recommendation.
The girls came on time, were extremely attentive to our needs and cleaned the house extremely well.
After they were done, someone called from the office to ensure we received good service.
I already have scheduled for them to come out again.
Highly recommend them.

Save yourself the brain damage and call anyone else.

Worst business and extremely unprofessional.
They forgot to clean the downstairs bathroom left the floors covered in dust bunnies and skipped a lot of other things left sheets in the washer didn't make the bed etc...
They came back to clean up and offered me 10% off my next cleaning service.
Save your time & money & do it yourself.
