This used to be a different gas station a few months back.
It recently reopened as Decatur Sunset AP.
Not sure if the gas pumps were replaced or not, but on my last visit to get gas the card readers on the pumps were out of order (on every pump).
There was no sign stating this on the pumps either, the readers just didn't do anything.
Going inside to pay for gas isn't THAT big of a deal.. if doing so works.
I had to go back in a second time because my pump was still telling me to pay inside.
As did other customers.
It literally took me 23 minutes to gas up from the time I pulled in to the time I drove off, because I had to stand in line twice before I could pump gas.
I think I will give this gas station a few more weeks to work out these kinks before I try gassing up there again.

This by far the worst am/pm around.
The gas pumps are always down in the morning.
Only thing you can do here basically is go in the store and buy things.
What's with the pumps always down in the morning ?
A lot of people fuel up before work or getting the day started.
I guess you can't get gas in all the am/pm hours.
Who ever runs this place needs to get gas available at all times.
Horrible place this is.

A gas station that is always out of gas.
Wth.
Its like Mcdonalds being out of fries.
There are businesses nextdoor with hundreds of commercial vehicles that could give them a ton of business, but everyone refuses to go there for anything.
So do I.
