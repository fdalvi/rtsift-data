When my Barber for 10 years moved back East, I didn't know where to go.
I must've tried 6-7 barbers, until I finally met Charlie, the owner.
Clean, organized, and very personable.
Always going above and beyond.
Now I travel 18 miles from phx, just for the perfect haircut, and personal service.
The shop it self is roomy, and perfect for the usual male salon commentary.
Usually busy on Fridays and Saturdays, as to be expected, so I try to make it out earlier in the week.
I finally found my new place.

Great customer service  Friendly people  Always fun Being in this place..  Best barbers in town..
