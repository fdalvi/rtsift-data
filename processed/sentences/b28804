Our family eats out at Chinese on a regular basis.
This restaurant was nothing over the to, but definitely better than the other reviews would lead you to believe.
The aromatic duck was slightly overlooked but tasted great.
The pork was cooked perfectly and the dry fried green beans were outstanding.
Great garlic mix and a nice spice to them.
Everything had a terrific flavour that was enjoyable.
I would return to this location again.
