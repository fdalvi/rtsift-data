I needed my hair dyed and my Hair Stylist was unavailable.
I tired Amy at Sachi.
She did a great job with my color.
I love it and have had many complements.
I definability will be going back.

I needed my hair colored, cut, and styled for Valentines day.
I am a red head so I am very picky about my stylists.
Amy did an AMAZING job on everything.
I've gotten so many compliments on my hair already!
She is very knowledgable and friendly, I highly recommend her and I will definitely be back.

Since I have been going to Amy my hairstyle has gone from the nineteen eighties to a more contemporary look.
Following her advice has helped the condition and thickness of my hair.
I love it!
My husband says I look ten years younger.
