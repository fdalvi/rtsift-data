Great stamp shop friendly staff...any stamp you can imagine is most likely there my second trip there was even better than the first!
!firsthand

This is the mother of stamp stores!
If you are into rubber stamping and the thought of driving to a stamp store only to find scrapbooking paper and brads with one measly token wall of stamps makes you want to scream,  then this is the store for you!
This is a real Rubber Stamp store.
It is filled to the brim with rubber stamps!
Wall to wall with a fun Vintage Vegas retro Movie Star vibe and décor.
All of the categories are neatly mapped out on shelves from Steampunk , cats , people to florals making it easy to find what you want.
There is a table with cheap pre owned stamps to fish through with comfy chairs to siton.
I can just sit there for hours looking for goodies.
They have unmounted grab bags, some magazines ( RSM etc), risqué to cute.
Unique stamps you won't find in a local craft store.
They are very accommodating here if you want something a certain way ( unmounted vs mounted etc).
Seriously I have been to stamp stores across the country and this is the best one I have seen it is loaded with actual stamps!
There are supplies but I'd say 10% of the stock is paper or inks.
They even have nice sales sometimes.
Great store with great service.

This store is Amaze-Balls!!!
It really is wall to wall stamps and little else.
I love that they has something for everyone.
There are mermaids, presidents, vintage cars, steam punk, every saying that you could imagine on a stamp and you never thought you would see.
They have a variety of art styles so you can find you image in the style you are looking for.
They have the typical holiday, floral, dogs and cats and so on - but again, in a variety of styles.
If you can think of something wild, they probably have it or can get it for you.
I was there for 2 hours and I could have been there longer.
This really is a must see if you are in Vegas and a stamper.
