I was on my way to ride my bike and hike near Lake Mead and I decided to do a little detour and have breakfast on Water Street in Henderson.
I daresay I haven't been on the street in 40 plus years.
The place I had bookmarked was closed so I walked across the street to the Eldorado Casino--owned by the Boyd Group--to have breakfast there.
Mary's Diner is a 50s kind of place with lots of memorabilia from the era.
This is so off the beaten path that I think all of the customers were locals.
This is not a destination casino.
I ordered the chili and cheese omelette.
It comes with breakfast potatoes and toast.
It was very good and very filling.
My server was Stacey and she was a delight!
While eating, I enjoyed the music of that era playing on the loudspeakers.
I couldn't help but hum the tunes.
The music of my younger days!
This was a good breakfast spot.

Geez where do I start... the waitress was really rude.
She had a bad attitude and an opinion on everything.
She forgot the ketchup we had to ask the guy sweeping the floor to get us some.
The food we received was nasty greasy low grade freezer junk.
We felt a little sick to our stomachs after eating.
Keep in mind it was a Saturday night and hardly anyone was there, should have been a sign.
The only good thing here was the cute d√©cor.
But seriously if you want to eat, especially a nice breakfast go to Rainbow across the street it is much better.
