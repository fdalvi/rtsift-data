This is a great bookstore if you are looking for a gift or even for yourself.
They have everything from religious books, top sellers, music, art, CD's.
They have a great children's section as well.
Sign up for their members reward program.
They have two of them.
One is free and the other is $25 a year.
You earn points (5 and 10% respectivly) towards merchandise.
You also get their catalog and it includes a coupon.
I also check out their clearance section.
They have two- one for adults and one for children.
They are always offering deals there.
If you have not been in a while I would go.
I would avoid though right before Mother's Day and Christmas.
Those are the two busiest times.

I had just been to the Chandler Deseret location and didn't realize the there was a second store nearby.
This too is wonderful bookstore (though smaller then Chandler) where you can purchase both Christian and LDS items.
The only drawback to this location is there is no Lion House Pantry.
Being a non-Mormon, I've found the staff both friendly and helpful and have never been proselytized.
Since I do have several Mormon friends,  I've found the Deseret Bookstore a good place to go to purchase hard to find Holiday gifts.
Enjoy!

I love the staff here.
They are so helpful and nice, but they stay out of your way while you shop.
I just bough my stepson his scriptures, since it's going to be a while before he can be baptized, and he was grinning ear to ear.
I love just walking around in here, looking at the beautiful artwork & feeling at peace.
