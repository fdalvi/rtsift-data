For a fast food chain restaurant, this location does it right.
Fast, friendly service, they always get my order right, and its filling food at a super economical price.

Friendly service.
Clean.
Outdoor seating too.
Thursday chicken tacos 3 for $2 are delicious.

Gross, this place is gross.
It is cheap, but that is obviously for a reason.
Some fast food places nearby are even worse, & not even as cheap though, so no surprise they are still in business.
What is it about fast food places not serving healthy food, seriously what is so slow about an apple, or banana?
Healthy alternatives to what this place serves up may even be more affordable in some cases, organic bananas sell for 69 cents a pound nearby.
For those who believe depopulation is necessary, this place is highly recommended for you first.

Great hang out spot.
Their burgers are some of my favorites!
Their churros are great, too.
Open late.
Cheap.
Taco Tuesday friendly!
Ask for a quad burger or a triple del!
They'll add parties onto the burgers for an extra charge.
