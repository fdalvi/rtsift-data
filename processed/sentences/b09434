Love this place!
Small and locally owned by an awesome chick that really cares.
Grab a latte next door at Steve's and then relax as they take care of you here :)

Got me in right away, very friendly & helpful.
Excellent callus removal without attitude.
Sugar scrub, moisturizer, leg & foot massage & hot stone.
Simply the best pedi I've had in ages.
Not the cheapest, but I will return.
