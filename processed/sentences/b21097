Not been in for fabric.. but stopped in earlier in the week to get my brows & upper lip done in preparation for 'party season' coming up..   Â£7 to get brown & upper lip threaded which seems to be the going rate on Leith Walk.
I walked in and was seen to straight away, although two others came while I was 'in the chair' and were seated and had to wait.
I felt like she was a bit rushed with two people waiting.
Although she was still pretty thorough and much more gentle than the other place I went to a few weeks back.
Would def go back.
Pretty sure they're cash only, so come prepared!
