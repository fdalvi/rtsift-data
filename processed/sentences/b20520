A-OK here stands mostly for:  Alright, Overpriced but Kalright.
I was (now am again) in desperate need for a wax.
I'm not going to tell you what I needed to have waxed, suffice to say the plight of the great Mediterranean blood hits me quite hard and I like to keep up appearances that I am not, in fact, a woman of the bush or an unkempt hippie.
So, I went a-hunting for a wax.
Did I want threading?
No, but found about a hundred places to do that.
Did I want plucking?
No, but I found a weird cheap place that did that.
But I found PURE and they were a beautiful little place that felt all comfy, relaxing and spa-like.
But for a 20 minute session inside a locked room, these bells and whistles mean very little.
Soothing music gets overshadowed by the pain, so frankly it fell on dead - eyes?
I paid 35 dollars (20 quid).
For shame!
(did I use this right British people?).
Yea, I know.
There are little Vietnamese ladies in Boston screaming at me from overseas - I'll do it for your for 1/4 that price.
But I was beastly, and my uni-brow was making a comeback and I can't have that.
But the hair (was) gone, so not too many complaints.
She did it, well and quick, so if you like spending 20 pounds on something that should be 8 - TOPS...
This place is for you, you freak.
And the hunt continues.
