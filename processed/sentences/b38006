WONDERFUL!
great, smart guys.
Have taken my laptop a couple of times.
Great service and VERY reasonable priced!
Michael Habros is my guy!

Mike is great!
I had pretty much reached the conclusion that my PC was a lost cause!
Nope!
He was able to find a compatible motherboard and clean it up!
Fast and reasonable!
Will definitely use them again!

Mike is so great!
Several people at my office have been going to him for years, and my husband and I started taking our laptops to him.
He is super knowledgeable and very trustworthy.
I highly recommend him.

I absolutely recommend KMJ.
Great personalized service.
My father recommended Mike and he was right.
