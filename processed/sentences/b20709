Monkey Temple is an independent retailer, selling Nepalese clothes and imports.
It also sells various goods aimed at the "alternative" shopper, like incense and little Buddhas.
Shops like Monkey Temple are always in danger of seeming pretentious.
Items like Tibetan prayer flags and bowls are marketed at the more middle class new age market rather than Edinburgh's resident Tibetan Buddhist population.
But Monkey Temple does its best to seem genuine with its Nepalese stock imported straight from the source.
It does have a great atmosphere (with nice smells and warm colours all around) with some genuinely nice trinkets on sale in a relaxed environment.
The staff are friendly too.
It's a fun shop to browse in.
The clothes themselves are bright, colourful and varied.
From skirts to hoodies expect some to find some nice gems.
I personally love their selection of woolen clothes!
However as with all shops like it, don't expect high street prices.
It's also worth keeping in mind that the range of stock for men is not as great.

Most of my friends are makeshift Monkey Temple models.
Not in the sense that they're officially modeling for Monkey Temple, but you will rarely see a hippie around Edinburgh who isn't sporting something from Monkey Temple.
Their designs are pretty awesome, though, to be honest, sometimes they're a BIT too strange for me.
But that's mainly because I have huge issues with overcomplicated clothes.
If it's not straightforward, I get very nervous and feel as if the clothes (yes, just a bit of inanimate cloth) are smarter than me.
I've spent a lot of time wandering back and forth from Monkey Temple to Joolz trying to decide who to give my money to, to eventually give up and walk home with my pocket intact.
But I'm sure all y'all have more money than me, so you should stop by Monkey Temple and have a shop.
If you don't, there's always this great box full of things for 3 pounds (2 for 5).
