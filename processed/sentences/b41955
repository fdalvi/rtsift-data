I LOVE Pilates Central.
The studio is clean and in a great location.
Vanessa is a GREAT teacher!

I LOVE Pilates Central!
They offer multiple classes that are very accommodating to my schedule (working, single mom) I have never taken Barre classes until I tried them at Pilates Central, and now I am there every week!
Britney is my teacher and she is GREAT!!
Highly recommend

Vanessa is an accomplished trainer and a life-learner who found her calling in the Pilates method.
Funny and warm, she makes the experience - whether class or private session - fly by.
Yet there is no doubt at the end of the hour that one's entire body has just been put through a hard workout.
She seeks out additional training, seminars, and methods to constantly better herself and ensure she is challenging and supporting her clients.
The studio is a spa-like environment that allows you to slip away from your day for a little while, and it is always spotlessly clean.
I leave each session feeling taller, thinner, calmer, and stronger.
