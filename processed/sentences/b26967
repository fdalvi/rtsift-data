REGULAR MASSAGE SPA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They have couple massage rooms and 2 table shower room and another room ( I didn't try it and forgot to ask what that room for).
One massage bed in my room, and simple but very neat decoration on the wall.
I love their room design, small table at the corner....
I wish I could have one room in my house too :)    I love Gina's service, so welcome with soft hands and soft voice.
Also, she always smiling.... & never pick up any phone call!
Thank you for consider my feeling!
woops...
I forget to take pictues :(  --- I'll update soon!
