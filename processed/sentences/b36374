So far.
So good.
I had a 12 appoint mention and they took me in right away.
I just went to get a estimate of the damage and to see if I can get a check right away.

Car accidents suck!!
So when some dumb girl rear ended my beautiful car, I was pissed.
After settling with their insurance, it was finally time to get my car fixed.
I dropped my car off and Brett walked me through the whole progress.
He said they would give me a call once my car was finished.
Fast forward a week and it was time to pick up my car.
Another employee, Veronica made sure that everything was taken care of and that I was happy with the repairs.
The whole process from start to finish was super easy and fast.
Kudos!

The staff there are friendly.
The damage was minor but it took two weeks to get the car repaired because every time we were told it was "ready" it wasn't.
We had color matching issues.
Our claims rep, Erin, was great though!

Having progressive insurance is by far the best insurance to have first and foremost and having a real cool, caring and productive Agent also helps too.
So, due to someone side swipping my car while in a parking lot, I ended up here.
This place has Great customer service, the 2 ladies that helped me were very welcoming and informative on what was to come of my car on both visits.
I dropped off my car on 3/18 and finished on 4/1, the due date, also they had a rent a car awaiting my dropoff.
The body collision center that fixed my car did a great job on the paint and remodeled of both driver rear panels.
