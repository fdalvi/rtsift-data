Dr. Wayne not only knows his stuff when it comes to treating back pain, he is so fun to be around and down to earth!

Dr. Wayne has taken care of me and my family for several years now.
He has helped my back tremendously!
He has an open door policy and provides useful information on why and how to live healthier.
I look forward to being in Dr. Wayne's care for several ore years.

Main Points:  -Private room for treatment -Walk-ins accepted -Friendly doctor, doesn't make you feel rushed  Review: I needed to go to a chiropractor for the first time in my life, so I decided to see Dr. Wayne.
I was extremely nervous about the whole situation, but he made me feel at ease and explained everything to me every step of the way.
He didn't make me feel rushed at all, and made sure to address all my concerns.
Queen Creek Back Care is open everyday until 6:30pm and they accept walk-ins as well.
Definitely a positive experience for a not so positive situation!
