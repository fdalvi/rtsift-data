Not sure how there are Wells Fargo every 1.5 miles, but this is one that I enjoy going to.
They have the new atm that will accept checks and cash without envelopes.
This saves a lot of time.
The staff and employees are really courteous and professional.
If you cannot figure out which WFB to make your home, try this one!

the customer service rocks in this place.
i opened account there only because my paychecks come from there and that its across the street from my apt.
i like walking to places instead of driving......being green you know.
so it is nice that its a block away.
the other thing is the place is never busy,and is clean.
the guy who opened my account was Andy s. and all i have to say is he is a hott guy.
if you go in there make sure to check him out.
worth it by far.

This is my local Wells Fargo and i have to say they have excellent customer service and have helped me out with a few problems without any hassle.

a long time ago, well a few years ago, this used to be a Wachovia.
and when I needed to go to WF, I'd have to go down to Albertson's to visit their mini-branch there.
So happy that WF is here and that the ATM is drive thru because this means, I can get cash in my pajamas!
PS...this is my 300th review!

This is out branch of choice in Henderson.
Prompt, friendly, accurate, helpful....everything the branch on eastern and st rose is not.
Still cracks me up that wf has the need for 2 inches of bullet proof glass between you and the bankers, only issue with this is you can't hear each other.
And of course I always speak softly to quietly protest...get it, quietly protest?

Never thought I would be writing a review on a bank, but great service must be recognized.
WF employee Brandi was efficient in assisting me and even reminded me of the need to renew my driver's license.
I did not realize it needed to be renewed.
Thank you Brandi for your help!
