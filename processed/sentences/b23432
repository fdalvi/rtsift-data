Michael Moore of 24/7 Las Vegas Notary was outstanding in his dedication to make sure I had a notary at my home at 6:15 AM due to a telephonic court case I had with Florida.
I highly recommend calling Michael when you need someone to be prompt and professional.

As good as it gets.
Fast, courteous, helpful, super friendly, extremely knowledgeable, and above all honest.
I have no doubts that Michael can address any concerns you might have as well as help guide you along the way.
A true professional.
It sounds corny but this guy is a complete package that I didn't even know a notary could be!
Apparently he has other notaries that work with him in order to provide 24 hr service and accommodate customers in a timely fashion no matter where they are located or if they have special needs.
I suppose this means your experience might be different, but I'd be very surprised if anyone associated with this operation served you wrong.
I mean the guy will refer potential customers to chain stores if he feels that their needs (time / cost) would be better met ... what a guy!
Trust me when I say this is the place to call if you have any notary needs.
It's been a long time since I've felt so cared for as a customer!
Do not hesitate, call now :-)

Michael was great.
I contacted him via email and he got back to me promptly.
We set a time and he arrived when he said he would.
I will definitely contact him again when I need a notary.
