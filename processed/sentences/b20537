You always hear about plus size ladies in fashion but what about the plus size guys?
Until I stumbled across High and Mighty the other day, I'd never really thought about plus size guys but this shop caters for guys that are larger than the average Joe.
Whether it's a new suit, polo shirt, jacket, tee or any other item of clothing, there's an excellent range on offer at High and Mighty.
After mentioning it to my friends the other day I found out that one of my friends regularly goes here for shoes.
He's a size 13 and said he finds it almost impossible to get shoes to fit that don't make him look like Herman Munster.
At High and Mighty they stocked shoes from size 6 - 17!
You know what they say about guys with big feet... big socks.
