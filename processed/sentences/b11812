Don't know what it is but I've always used Supercuts.
Here in Las Vegas I just got to whatever location I happen to be near when there urge to get a haircut strikes.
This place was great.
No wait.
No line.
Quick in & out in under 15 minutes.
Very friendly ladies and an affordable haircut $13.95 + tip.
I will be back in 2 weeks.

I frequent here since I live in the area, they are always friendly and the wait is never long.
