Just dirty enough to be dressy.
I love Varvatos, this store had much more to offer than you can find elsewhere.
Staff was friendly, selection was easy to navigate.

This store has a nice installation of hanging lightbulbs.
I know, its been done before, but i like that kinda stuff!
The guy there was super friendly, he talked to us about how items were made and why.
There was a pair of weathered leather boots that actually had nails on the bottoms like back in the good ol' days.
He also informed me of Varvatos locations in LA & OC & San Fran....I was really impressed how familiar he was with everything Varvatos.
Too bad they don't have a womens selection.

A clean layout with that "grungy but well dressed" feel that makes it easy for persons like Iggy Pop or the fellas from ZZ Top to model his wares - the stores is excellent.
Browsing the pieces, exclusively mens, I did manage to identify some items that I liked but the size selection was incredibly limited - especially compared to the amazing CBGB's convert flagship in NYC.
Can't really fault Varvatos for his prices - it is what it is and the materials are great.

Joy is like a familiar friend helping you find your best look.
She knows her stuff and defines superior customer service.

Great store, Joy is awesome to help you pick the right suit or whatever.
She doesn't take any offense if you don't like something or are particular about a fit or style.
I recently had a suit fitted there, and I had them make some pretty dramatic changes, they did them to a T, and the suit fit flawlessly.
Joy was sure to give me her personal number, and text me back when I had a question.
Highly recommended if you like this style of clothing.
Wish they served drinks while your shopping though :)

I wish I could give this store no stars.
Stopped in during a girls trip in December of last year to buy my boyfriend a Christmas gift.
It was during the day and I was dressed in comfortable clothes (jeans, t-shirt, and Chuck's).
The staff didn't say one word to me nor did they even acknowledge my presence in the store, which was obscenely overpriced for the quality.
A gentlemen walked in wearing designer clothes and the staff was more than happy to greet and assist him.
Apparently, I didn't look like a serious buyer so the staff didn't give me the time of day.
I work very hard and can afford to shop at a store like John Varvatos but after my experience in Las Vegas I won't ever step foot into one of his judge mental stores again.

Simply put, there are a few places of this level that I choose to support and on the rare circumstances where I do break down and indulge instead of look I feel truly grateful that I have the opportunity to do so, a situation only enhanced by the quality of service exemplified here by a woman named Joy who spent nearly an hour of her day digging through the collection with me while talking like an old friend.
Certainly not a store for everyone but a man who has earned my respect with both his fashion and his people.

Sometimes all you need is a little serendipity in your life.
I traveled to Vegas to meet a very good friend and the plan was to have dinner with his brothers at Spago (see separate review) in Caesars, nestled in the Forum shops.
On the way into our 6 pm reservation, I noticed the John Varvatos shop and told my friend I would need to check it out after dinner.
I'm a big fan of John's fashion, don't always have the means to buy a lot of pieces but I have a few and really enjoy what I have.
I was like a kid in a candy store.
So many cool pieces and article other than clothing.
Just a cool vibe with the best customer service.
Joy was just that.
Complete professional with a desire to engage all of her customers.
I'm heading back to Vegas in May and will definitely be spending some time and money in this shop.
