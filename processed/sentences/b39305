Located inside the Sola Salon in Henderson, ARae does a wonderful job mixing colors to get the right shades.
She's fun to be around, has competitive pricing and uses Paul Mitchell products!
I drive across the valley for her excellent service.

I love getting my hair done by A-Rae.
I always feel 10 years younger.
She is truly a talented colorist!

Britny is awesome!
She is very knowledgable about hair coloring and knows just what to do to make you feel like a movie star.
She is very friendly and personable during the whole service and prices are very reasonable.
I have never ever been and felt anything less than wonderful every time I go.
The shop is very clean and convenient to a lot of places.
I will definitely go back!

Meaghan is the best!!!
I am very skeptical about my hair and have had a very hard time finding a stylist I could trust.... Until I met Meaghan !!!
I came in with dark red hair (which is really hard to change) and she gave me the most beautiful blond, and dark brown highlights.
And even gave my red a lot more color!
She also cut my hair exactly how I asked and I couldn't be happier!
Go to her salon because you will be coming back to her for a long time!
