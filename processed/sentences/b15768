I've been going here for quite a while now.
It took me a few months to find a barber I liked here in Vegas, haven't been to another shop since.
Gene and company do a great job, worth checking out if you're looking for a good place to get your haircut.

If you're looking to get a good haircut, then this is where you have to go.
I've been going to this barber shop for a while now and they give really good haircuts.
Check them out!
And I promise, you won't regret going there.

This place is run down on the inside.
I went in, sat down, and was scared away by how disheveled the place was.

This place is open and not closed for business.
I think there is somebody that is trying to sabotage this business, which is doing its best to serve its customer.
There is a person who is also saying that this place looks rundown but it is perfectly fine.
The ceiling has an evidence of water leak due to the landlord is not responding and not taking care of the roof.
It should be replaced soon.
Other than that, everything looks great.
The barbers here are so friendly and professional.

I started coming here about a year ago.
Since then, i made this place my barber shop.
I hope it is still open.
Takes me 3  years to find a nice barber shop like this.

Gene and his crew do a great job of cutting hair, I have been very satisfied with their haircuts...I have been to all the barbers there and they all do a good job...

Place is great.
It was recomended by a friend and now I wont go anywhere else.
Haven't found a place that can give a great razorfade in years, till now.
I will continue to go here for as long as I live here.
