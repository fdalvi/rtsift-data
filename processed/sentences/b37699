I followed the barbers here from another barbershop when they decided to open their own shop.
The place looks great and it's even closer to where I live.
I would not go anywhere else!

Great cut.
They take they're time and are very friendly.
Great price and clean atmosphere.
This is my new barber shop.

I went on a Sunday afternoon with my son so we could both get our hair cut.
There was one Barber that was just finishing up her last client.
We waited about 15 minutes and were never acknowledged by the barber.
Right when her last patron was finished?
She called my son up.
Right then, another person came in and she said she told him he was next and that she would hurry with my son.
She never told me she had an appointment coming in and wasted both of our time.
This was the second time in the last month that we tried this barber.
The prior visit, there was two ladies cutting hair, we were next To go and right before we were called up, two people with appointments showed up.
At no time were we told their was a wait either occasion or that they had appointments next.
This is a Barber as advertised, not a Beauty Salon.
Barbers historically are walk in.
This is not a "friendly barber" as the name indicates.
The service and communication at this shop I horrible.
Don't waste your time.
Go across the street to Mr. D's or down the street to Anthem Barbers near Smiths.
Way more professional and always have ample staff to cut hair.

This is the best place to get your haircut and I always enjoy getting my haircut.
Thanks for all your great service.

I have been looking for a good  haircut for sometime.
Today Belinda cut my hair @ Friendly barbershop and was very pleased with the way she cut my hair.
She took her time timed my mustache and fussed over the haircut.
I will be back.

Walked in at close to closing time, and got a stellar cut.
Thank you Rose.
