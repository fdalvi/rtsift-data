Over priced burnt coffee, bad service, breakfast sandwich was greasy

It's infrequent for me to find something completely terrible.
And when I do have less-than-stellar experiences, I usually don't bother to review them.
Thanks Yelp app.
I ordered two large lattes because the LVH discount book gives you $4 off said order.
The good news is that the two large coffees "only" cost $7.47.
The bad news is that they taste like a watered down mess.
Granted, it's a single shot of espresso in a 20oz cup.
But still, it just tastes off.
Burned milk?
Who knows.
Back to the good news, I feel much, much better about the lattes I make at home.
