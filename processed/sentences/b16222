This is pretty standard as far as Little Caesar's go, nothing really that stands out from any other of these locations around the valley.
Though I will give credit to the people in the kitchen for the hustle on the turnaround of pizzas.
So good job on the speed!

Very fast Very friendly Very hot Very Good ...Enough said.

Received a new home owners free coupon in the mail from them.
The only store to do so.
Would have never stopped there otherwise.
But i passing by and i do love pizza.
..so what did i have lose.
Walking in and in less time than you say thank you i had my free pizza.
I must say that  i was very surprised with the quality and quantity.
Why would anyone go to papa Murphy pay more and start your home oven in this heat .
Not sure they'll be around very long.
Any who I'm going to try  little Caesar deep dish next week for only$8.00.
I'll review it

Promised to review Little Caesar's deep dish pizza.
Well today I stopped there at 5 pm.
Customer traffic was impressive.
Very little to no waiting time.
The deep dish pizza comes with pepperoni, which one small bite will give me heart burn for a month of Sunday's, the very friendly guy behind the counter promised a cheese only in less then 10 minutes.
Only took 8 minutes.
The quality was perfect.
...taste excellent.
8 large square pieces, actually 2 sections of 4 .
Best deal in Las Vegas for only $8.00
