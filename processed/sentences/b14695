Fast service nice staff.
I went on a Saturday morning.
They open at 9.

Upon arrival I was on the phone with one of the clerk (Betty).
This wasn't my first visit to this location.
I asked her do u guys still offer 3cents copy for Tuesday.
She said yes we do, I reply that's great.
I explain to her if it ok if I can email the copy over for them to copy for me because the clarity.
With a rude tone, she said no we can't.
I work with the owner today and he said no, starting to ask what business am I working at.
That's not really het business to asked.
Anyway if you want to come in here make sure don't ask for Betty or ask for another clerk.
Unprofessional and rude!!!

I have been to this location many times to overnight items.
The staff is always friendly and courteous and willing to help.
I have never had to wait more than a few minutes.
Quick in and out.
I will definitely continue to use this location for my specialty mailing.

I own a small business the occasionally ships items all across the US.
I normally bring my items unwrapped and have the store box and ship the items.
Depending on where these items go, the price normally ranges between $40-$60.
When I was sick, I asked my wife to take the same items and ship them with a directions on what I needed done.
The owner proceed to wrap and ship the items in huge boxes ( way larger than they needed to be) and charged my wife $126 for the same items I normally have them box and ship for half the price.
When she asked him why it was so expensive he told he that they didn't have a smaller box and that was all he could do.
When I confronted him the following day Ian's sacked why he would take advantage of my wife, he responded and told me and my wife (her standing next to me) that my wife must be lying and he only package the item the way she requested.
I now drive twice the distance to the Dysart Rd.
FedEx store for shipping.
