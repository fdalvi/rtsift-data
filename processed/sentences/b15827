Not real Asian food by any means but it will fill you up if you are on a budget.
On the plus side, the place is kept very clean and it's fast.
Be careful if you are diabetic, the chain uses a TON of sugar in everything.
It's what they substitute because PE doesn't use MSG.

I love panda but this place sucks.
There is barely any sauce on the chow mein, they didn't cook the onions through and said they never do.
They added extra chilies to the spicier foods and that burned going down.
Not going back!
I think they are confused about whether it is a chinese or mexican restaurant.

Worst Panda Express I have ever been to.
The service is horrible.
The people that work at this location are very rude.
They make you wait forever for the food to be prepared if they have run out of what you want.
Never again.
I would rather drive further to a better location.
