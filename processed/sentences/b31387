Amazing, wonderful, relaxing - there aren't enough adjectives in the dictionary to describe Debbie and her services.
I hesitate to say I got a facial, because it was so much more.
If there were just one word to describe the total experience, it would be VAVOOM!!!!
I have had facials in the past, but I encourage you to book one with Debbie at Spa tacular Sleekskin, and I promise you that you'll never go anywhere else.
No "big stuffy spa atmosphere" here.
Debbie will discuss with you one on one what you are needing/wanting and customizes the facial - each and every time!
My skin is unbelievably soft, and brighter and I can't wait for my next visit!
Thanks Debbie - seriously, you're the BEST!

A professional esthetician and one-woman show, Debbie customizes each treatment to suit your skin and your mood.
She is savvy and experienced, staying abreast of the latest developments in the field.
A monthly facial with Debbie is something I wouldn't miss.
She also carries a great selection of products, and  I'm always delighted with the results!

I truly cannot stop talking about my wonderful experience at Sleekskin.
Debbie's knowledge and expertise, genuine interest and outgoing demeanor left me leaving with a smile on my very clean and smooth face.
She told me things about my skin that no other aesthetician or dermatologist had ever pointed out or noticed.
The selection of products is as amazing as the fact that she doesn't guilt you into purchasing them.
I can't wait to go back!
