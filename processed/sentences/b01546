I was in and out of here so quickly!
They made me feel welcomed

Went here for a blood draw on a Monday morning.
I had an appointment which I think made things smoother but it was not crowded at all.
Clean, efficient, and friendly.
I wish I made note of the woman who drew my blood.
It is the first time ever that I actually did not feel anything, yes, not even a pinch, when the needle entered and on top of that when it was over I really could not see where she went into my arm.
Even in the following days (where sometimes in the past have been a little sore or have seen a small area of bruising where the needle entered -- there was NOTHING.
