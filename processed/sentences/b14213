Adjacent to Pei Wei in the AJ's shopping center on the SW corner of 67th Ave & the 101, and is always a nice follow up to a decent fast meal at Pei Wei.
Coupons are always in the paper so I tend to be a cheapskate and hit this place for the buy one get one free special.
Options are as good as any other location, and the teenage employees aren't punks like you find so often in retail spots these days.

I drove over the other night to grab ice cream for the fam thinking they closed at 10pm.
They closed at 9pm and I walked in at 856.
I asked if I was too late, and they not only welcomed me in but face me such great service that I left a 50% tip.
These girls are the best.

Cold Stone is my first choice whenever we want to get ice cream.
This location is awesome; the employees are personable, it's a clean shop, and of course, the ice cream is amazing.
Yes, you're paying a little more than Dairy Queen or Baskin Robbins, but you're getting quality ice cream and great service in return.

Best ice cream in town!
Kids love the cotton candy ice cream in a cup, wife loves the coffee ice cream with brownies in a waffle cone, and I could eat the cake batter ice cream by the gallon.
No let down, no disappointments, and they were not out of anything.
