A really handy location for this café, right between St James Centre, the bus station and Multrees Walk.
It was a busy period and I was looking around to see what and where two chairs and a table for a good old chat up with a friend who I hadn't seen in an age.
I eyed twice on a target and twice other customers behind me claimed them with the moved of the partner.
oh how rude!!
Anyway I bought my coffee - cappucino with ameretto and skinny milk.
The barista was friendly and chatty too.
I get the felling there could of bee an extra person on the floor just to get the place a little tidier as it looked like they were being humped by how busy it was.
I managed to get a table and my friend came over a good few minutes later.
It just felt like an age between ordering, paying ang making/recieving both coffees.
But however they were nice, warm and required no sugar, which for me is a shock with chain coffee!
I've been trying to have my espresso based drinks without sugar and it's been a success but most of these drinks were from good independent cafés!
I think i will be back.
This place is handy.
