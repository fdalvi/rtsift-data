Best service ever thanks for you help with my speed ticket .
Real pro people work here fast service

I have been using Sin City Citations for well over a year now and I have to say the service is outstanding.
I want to thank the business as a whole for the great work they do and Lisa in particular who goes above and beyond.
Thank You  Romano.

This place is great!
After getting a ticket, a coworker referred me to Sin CIty Citations.
All I had to do was call, give them some info off of the ticket...then, they gave me an estimate date for when I should keep an eye in the mail.
My ticket got reduced to a parking violation and I just had to pay that fee through the mail (or online).
SUper easy.
Friendly staff...will use again if I HAVE to(but hopefully not).
I will definitely refer them to friends.
