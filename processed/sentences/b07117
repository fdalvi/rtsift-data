This store told me they are affiliated with UPS in name only.
When I took a return there the woman I spoke with rudely insisted I buy a $25 box before they would take my item.
They do not understand the concept of customer service and it may cause them to lose their business base.
I am now using the store on Regent St.

It's too bad this store has such a bad review from one customer.
I have had two positive experiences with customer service here - one woman gave me a helpful tip to cut down printing costs.
And if you want cheap printing for course readings - ups was nearly half the cost of fed ex and much less than office max it was kind of unbelievable.
Glad I called around first!

It is actually called the UPS Store so I thought I was dealing directly with UPS, but instead this is a middleperson store that basically washes it's hands when things go wrong.
The manager's idea of customer service is to give me the phone number of UPS.
I requested that she call UPS since I paid her and used this place and my phone call to UPS would only result in their telling me the UPS Store was at fault - back and forth, back and forth.
I WILL NEVER USE THIS PLACE AGAIN!
My lesson has been learned well and I am out $130.
