These guys were "old school" pros.
True craftsmen, and reliable.
Fair price for outstanding work.
I had them repair some very sentimental furniture and they did a great job end-to-end.
Pick up, repair, delivery and installation.
If you need expert work, with pure reliability, this is your company.
Ed and Brian are just great!

The men who operate this business truly care about quality work and a satisfied customer.
I have done business with them twice, once for a broken dining chair leg, and another time for a coffee table damaged by a teething puppy.
Both pieces were restored to their original condition (perhaps better than original condition!
) in short time at a completely reasonable price.
I highly recommend this business!
Their workmanship is outstanding.

I purchased a used bedroom set that had one of the trim pieces missing from a drawer.
I took the drawer here and after my experience there is nowhere else I would bring furniture for repairs.
Ed at Guardsman knows more about wood and furniture than any living person on the planet.
He was not only able to match the type of wood, but he custom made a stain to match my furniture.
I mentioned that the bed had a scuff mark as well, and Ed threw in some stain for me to take home.
They really go above and beyond for their customers!
10/10 would use again!
