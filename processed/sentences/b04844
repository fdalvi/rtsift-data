When we walked into this dimly lit parlor, I expected the worst.
The beige walls and tiles didn't scream," Welcome!
" and the frowning hairdressers followed suit.
I wrote my name down on the scraggly notepad, and waited for them to holler my name.
When my turn was finally up, I got a head massage that feels like someone digging there talons into your scalp, looking for a prize.
The combing of my hair was similar to a person using there teeth to comb out the knots.
The hairdressers talked to each other about smoking and respiratory failure, and AARP.
The only communication I got from my hairdresser was, "You got some thick hair, babe.
" They told us to come again and walked away.
Word of advice, if it's between a hobo washing your hair with some soap from the dollar store and STYLE 5 washing your hair, go with the hobo.

The best little shop.
All the girls are great, ask for Rachel.

I've been coming here for 3 years.
Great place and Rachel is the best!
I'm never disappointed by my cut & I look forward to going over there and chatting with everyone.
Usually a very short wait or none at all.
I moved from Henderson and still drive 20 minutes to go see Rachel.

Great environment and great price.
Ask for Zulma or Rachel.
Zulma can do a killer fade.
