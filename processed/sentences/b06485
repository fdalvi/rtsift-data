I am a victim of identity theft and can't get them to return my calls to clear my account despite having sent them proof that the debt is not mine.
I've called and emailed for two weeks without results and my credit rating has dropped more than 80 points because of this.

These guys suck big time..As one of the other guys said.. they try to threaten you... and hide all the facts

I fell behind on my medical bills and this collection agency was kind enough to set me up on a payment plan.
The truly are the nicest collections agency I've ever dealt with.
