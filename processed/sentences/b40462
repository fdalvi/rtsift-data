Well last night we decided to check this new place out.
Just to see how it was.
For a saturday night in spring mnt it was terrible service.
There was maybe 3 other tables that were occupied with us and they still keep forgetting my orders.
There were a few interesting items in the menu but nothing really stands out and the taste were a little bland.
The sashimi was pretty big than normal and fresh.
But the other sushi had a powdery taste to it.
So had to water it down just to get the taste out.
The place looks really nice and spacious inside.
Maybe in a couple of weeks we will come back to see if anything changes.
For their grand opening they should have advertised and did some kind of special to lure more customers in the store.

Group of 3 of us went back and try again to give them a chance.
But seem like nothing change, get worst than before, server kept forget our order, server didn't even know ikura or shirashi is or tamago, tabigo, kani or hotate, or maki roll.
Server don't even know what that was.
Omg Atmosphere  I give 60% Ambience  I give 20% Service I give 10% Food I give 10%  A lot of improve for this restaurant,  worst to dine back

Amazing food, horrible customer service.
One server had me, my sister & nephew waiting for 15 mins.
just so we can be seated.
She had a lot of opening tables.
Really aggravated us, so we left.
Only good thing is the food.
