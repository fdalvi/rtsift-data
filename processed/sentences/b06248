Ive worn glasses all my life and have been to a ton of eye dr's but Dr Meharry is the best!

I went with a friend so he can order his glasses.
While we were there, I ordered some replacement rubber parts for my Oakley  prescription glasses.
I then got a call from Taylor and she  said that they are able to order the parts from Oakley.
She then proceeded to get my credit card number and charged me for the item.
After a few weeks of waiting, I called them up to find out what was happening.
The lady who answered the call said Taylor was with a customer and she'll  get back to me as soon as she can.
Taylor did not call me till the next day.
She informed me that there was a mix up and the part was in back order.
She told me to wait for her call again.
This was a month ago already.
Till now I still have not gotten a call from them.
I know that the item I have ordered doesn't amount to the hundreds, but I would have thought they would treat all their customers the same.
I am very disappointed with their service and I would not recommend this place to anyone else!

I went to this clinic for my last eye exam and found the staff and doctors extremely friendly and helpful.
Since moving to another area of town, I'm delighted to find they have 3 other clinics to choose from and that there is still one near me.

Awesome staff.
Friendly and patient.
They can order practically anything if you look through their catalogs.
I really do love the selection here.
