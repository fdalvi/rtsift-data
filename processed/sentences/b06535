Great nursery just outside of town, on Mineral Point Road and about 5 minutes to the beltline.
The staff are super friendly and helpful.
What I like best is that its close by and offers a wider selection of annuals, perennials and shrubs than places like Home Depot (so your yard doesnt look like an office park) and with lower prices.
Bonus: end of summer clearance sale in August rocks with 50% discounts, 3 lilies for $10, etc.
just in time for fall plantings.

Best greenhouse in town!

Service Sucks!
I Went to get a specific type of tomato plant.
K & A has many types located in a large enclosed area - at least 40' long.
I asked a clerk about the tomato I sought.
She said she knew that K & A had that variety at one time and if they still had it it would be along the west facing wall.
So she narrowed my search from roughly 80' to 40' feet with no certainty that the plant was even available.
She made no effort to help me find the plant I was looking for.
Ironically, the clerk wore a shirt that said if you have a question just ask.
In truth the shirt didn't say that you'd actually get any help and this clerk certainly didn't provide any.
I subsequently went to ShopKo where two friendly employees helped me find the plant I was looking for.

Love it...Love it...Love it!
Had a great time here today shopping with my friend!
Super-Friendly and a great selection...we spent so much time, we took a lunch break!
My new favorite place, since my old greenhouse closed down!
