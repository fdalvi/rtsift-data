I live quite near this place and I think its name, although cheesy, is actually pretty cool.
I've been here twice and enjoyed it on both occassions as the service is quick and friendly and the food is delicious.
Inside it is small, clean and quaint with a really nice owner who is quick to process and prepare your order.
The menu has an extensive range of chow mein, sweet and sour and szechuan dishes.
In particular, the chicken kung po is excellent for its rich, spicy sauce with peanuts, green peppers and chillies.
With this I had a bag of prawn crackers, a coke and a portion of special fried rice which came to only about Â£6.50.
Yummy Yummy is a great Chinese takeaway and well worth a look is you're in the area.

I'll admit I first went into this place because of the name which tickled me, and the food was pretty good as well.
Exactly what you'd want from a Chinese, there are no great surprises but it's all round tasty food.
I had the beef chow mein in black bean sauce which was actually really good, but my friends' dishes were a little bland.
It seems to be a bit hit and miss; sometimes the dishes are great, other times they are a bit boring.
It is quick though and the staff are really friendly.
It's pretty cheap as well, which is always good, and for those living in Marchmont, it's not a bad local Chinese takeaway to have.

Yucky yucky.
Sauce thicker than treacle, sweeter than sin, and shitter than, well, shit.
Horrible.
And I had such high hopes too.
I'd heard only good things about this place.
I had the usual crispy chilli beef and it was just awful.
Soggy, tasteless, no heat, gooey awful awful awful.
I'm getting a bit upset talking about it.
Parting with the cash angered me.
I know I don't like Chinese takeaways at the best of times and I always get coaxed into having them, but normally they're edible.
I threw most of this away.
And I'm not one for throwing away food.
It gets 2* because my flatmate really enjoyed his.
But then he's no taste.
