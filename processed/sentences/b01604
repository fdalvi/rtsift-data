I went to Labcorp to have my blood drawn.
It's hard to say something nice about people who poke me with needles... but their staff was lighthearted and kind to a poor girl who's squeamish about giving blood.
-1 star because their lobby is small and their lovely flat-screen tv only loops mind-numbing healthcare "infomercials".

This facility has moved across the street to 3815 E. Bell suite 1405.
This clinic is behind the 3811 building so its kind of hard to see and tricky to get to.
The waiting area is much bigger than the other labcorp facilities to accommodate the average wait time of 40 mins for any walk in, so make sure you get an appointment thru their intuitive reservation system online @ www.labcorp.com   As much as I hate needles the Phlebotomist I had was a uber pro leet, got poked without even knowing, not sure if that a good or a bad thing.
Anyways it was much better than the one I had from Sonora Quest who left a bruise my arm and scar that lasted 2 weeks.
Bastard!

Relatively quick.
Got there about 11:20am, got my bloodwork/urine done about 15-20 mins later.
Not bad.
Walk-in okay.

I've only been here a couple of times and I'm not planning on going back due the the rudeness at the front desk.
Make an appointment, don't waste your time, it won't matter.
If you need assistance or the use of a wheelchair, better have your own, they do NOT provide anything like that at all.
