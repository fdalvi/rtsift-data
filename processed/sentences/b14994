Mariscos, Las Islas Del Capitan 27th Ave & Camelback Cost: $3 Service: 5 of 5, sit down place and nice.
Presentation: 5 of 5, came with chips and consume soup.
Taste 4 of 5, Good taste, this is more for the shrimp and fish tacos.

The place need a bid of upgrade, but the food is awesome.
I got the Campechana cocktail.

The shrimp tasted fresh but the meal was WAY over priced.
10 very small shrimp, a small salad, a small portion of refried beans, and a small portion of rice for $12.95.
I won't be back.

I had high expectations but was let down.
The quality of food was nothing special.
For the price I paid, I could get much more food at restaurants that prepare from scratch.
I felt ripped off after paying my bill.

I come in at least once a month since i work close by.
Fast service...ceviche is always great.
Have had the sopes and flautas and i have paid more for really bad food.
I think its a great spot!
