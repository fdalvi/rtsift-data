This store has a lot of toys.
Apparently toy shopping is so important these days that the store has to be open at 9pm on Thanksgiving day.
I am completely in awe at the depths of stupidity this nation has fallen to and this store is leading the way.
We shop here when looking for children's gifts.
It isn't the best store for atmosphere and so not the most fun place to shop in the first place.
Anyway, we won't be going here ever again since they are opening on a holiday.
If they didn't have this policy I would give them three stars with one star being for keeping their store hours away from the holiday out of respect for their employees.
If they treat their employees this way imagine how much they care about their customers.

I avoid this place like the plague.
I only come here when it is absolutely necessary, on a weekday and without children.
Hate the layout, pricing is fair, but so much other stuff going on its hard to find anything.
I would rather buy online than here.
Be warned!

This place is awful.
The price goes on the high side, and you can get much better deals online or in other stores.
The category classification is a mess.
There is no directory of whole place, given this is a huge store.
And you can't find what you want unless you happen to bump into it.
The customer service totally sucks.
When I returned a jigsaw, she couldn't understand what sawdust is and kept saying that during cutting every product would have that.
The thing is, when I opened the box and took out the pieces, the sawdust just messed my desk.
And she was not happy that I opened the item.
C'mon, how can I know I don't like it before I open the box?
Finally the refund was processed, and she didn't say thank you, even not looking at me!
I felt so offended and decided to NEVER EVER come back to this store or shopping online anymore!!
The name of the rude staff is Katy, in case you bump into her.

I hate the biggest toy store there is.
Gee wiz.
They do have good prices but it's the worst shopping experience and they sell sooo much CRAP.
The staff I dealt with there (checkout person) however was very pleasant.
The only reason I have for posting this review is to encourage people to shop the small businesses on etsy and in your local area.
It's worth the extra bit of money.
Buy less and buy better quality!
