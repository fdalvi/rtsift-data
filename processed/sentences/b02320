These guys (and gals) are awesome.
They have some of the best rates on servicing and inspecting equipment, and do a great job.
They will even do up to two FREE tank fills per person per day (donation jar optional), and decent prices on gear.
They coordinate dives and give great general advice.
Take an extra moment to make sure you know how to get there.

Purchased the Discover Scuba course via Groupon, and had a total blast!
Wasn't sure I'd be able to convince myself to actually breathe under water, but was pleasantly surprised when I did.
If you'd like to see if scuba is for you, the price is very reasonable.
Only $25 for a course that runs about 3 hours.
Tell em Swoop sent ya.

Best service I have seen in 10+ years of diving.
I had them inspect my reg/bcd hoping to have it serviced for a trip.
The news was not good; the bc and reg were very corroded.
Even though they knew we lived in Chicago, and would not be renting/buying at this time from them, they let me know the "bad" news with great honesty, and showed me the cracks, etc, that would make my gear unusable eventually, even if repaired now.
All this at no charge...they then stayed open an extra half an hour just chatting with us about diving.
Though we will rent gear in Hawaii this trip, we would absolutely rent or buy from them if we had more time and lived in AZ...when my husband and I DO decide to buy a couple of regulators, we will be buying here, and picking up or having it delivered.
Lucklily, we are in AZ often.
don't go anywhere else!
