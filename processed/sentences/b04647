I think its the Drive Thru thats the problem.
I go inside, everything is great.
I get my food home from the Drive Thru, no sauce, missing food, burned or 1/2 empty nacho cheese cups and crumb piles for chips.
Wish there were a 2.5 star rating I could give it

Like the previous yelper said!
Rating is the service.
Usually the food all taste the same!
That's why we keep on coming back!!!
You will have issues on the service, what do you expect?
Most of them are minimum wage kids!
They are just starting life!
So like any fast food franchise, you get what you paid for!
So be patient!

Burritos are mediocre.
But the tacos aren't bad.

Waited 15 mins for our order to be eaten there.
Drive through went 10x faster.
Also awkward atmosphere, and of course lots n lots of blue hairs!!
Go to the next one down the road.
