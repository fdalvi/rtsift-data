Horrible office.
They upcharge you and lie to your face.

I stand behind my original post.
It took months to resolve a bill that had an overcharge on it.
They try to sell you a 'mouthwash' that they claim insurance pays for but is really $60.
Luckily, my husband did not fall for it.
Sorry guys- we took our business elsewhere.

When I first came in Every one was smiling and I felt very welcome there.
The dentist , Dr. Sandhu was very gentle, very informative, and very pleasant.
The assistant was very upbeat and comforting because I was a nervous wreck of a patient.
They had very affordable payment plans so that I was able to get my teeth done that day.
I would definitely recommend this office to my friends and family.

You know that saying.... 'You get what you pay for'?
Well any time you go to a doctors office being Dental or Medical and are looking for a 'Deal' you are going to get what you pay for.
I wouldn't send my worst enemy to a place like these cooperate cheap dentist offices.
They advertise this cheap cleanings etc.
but then they have certain protocols to charge you more money.
Really.... if its sounds to good to be true it probably is......  My opinion....stay away!
