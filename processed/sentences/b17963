Van Galder uses clean, comfortable buses in good working order.
The drivers are courteous, helpful, and sometimes even funny.
They are as punctual as they can be, although they cannot control traffic.
This experience was way better than other buses I have ridden.
Van Galder  is a good, affordable way to travel between Madison and Chicago.
Buy your tickets at the Memorial Union to get the Wisconsin student discount.

Clean, reliably on time bus service between Madison and Chicago for just $27 each way.
Beats driving by a long shot.
You can pay on board or buy tickets at UW Memorial Union which are good for any departure.

I needed to get from O'Hare in Chicago to Madison and I didn't really feel like renting a car, or driving, or getting fined $30 for accidentally missing one of those dumb 50 cent tollbooths that are spaced out about every 20 miles (like I did the last time I drove from Chicago to Madison).
So I took the bus.
I'm a little old for the bus but it was cheap, fast (3 hours) and clean.
I sort of needed to pee at about the 2:30 point but I held it.
Sparking clean or not, I'm WAY too old to pee on a bus.
I'm taking the same bus back to Chicago in a few days.
And I will pee before I get on.
