I was on the hunt for a new salon.
While driving up headed to another the sign at this place caught my attention.
"Grand Opening.
10% off" ok you got me, plus it is much closer to home.
I walk in the door and am greeted with nice smiles.
The man sat me down in a great chair and set me up with the massage controller.
They have only been open a month.
The chairs are all brand new.
They did a great job, the basic pedi even includes a hot stone rub!!.
I got the callus remover.
We all know that one is usually a draw.
This place did it and my feet are smooth and no spots left undone.
LOVE IT!
Would absolutely recommend them to a friend.

Best nail salon in town!
Very friendly staff, super clean and great location.
Highly recommeded to all my friends plus anyone else.

Being greeted immediately after stepping foot in to the store by smiling and welcoming faces is always a plus.
I used a Groupon that I could not pass up on this 4 week old establishment.
$98 value that features 2 spa pedi's & 2 eye brow waxes for $40 was nearly impossible to pass up.
I highly recommend this new spot!
They're clean, affordable, friendly & attentive, how could you say no?

Would of gave it 5* but the brow wax wasn't the best.
But they did a fabulous job on my hands and feet me and my friends will return.

My friend and I went here today and used a Groupon for a manicure and pedicure.
We had a great experience!
The staff was so friendly and professional.
The location was very clean and nice.
I would definitely go back, even without a Groupon.
The prices were very reasonable.
The pedicure was heavenly.
They massaged my legs for a LONG time and used hot rocks.
We both loved our experience and walked away very relaxed.

This place just opened in March so they're still offering their $5.99 eyebrow wax and $19.99 (normally $35) Deluxe Spa Pedicure deal, which includes a leg mask, sugar scrub, seaweed gel, moisturizing lotion, hot stone massage, callus scrub, and hot towels in addition to the typical cleaning and polish.
It's owned by either a Vietnamese or Cantonese speaking family (I'm actually not sure, but that's what my best guess would be.
I like guessing what language people are speaking =] It's a silly game I play with myself).
They have 6 pedicure chairs and 6 manicure stations, all brand new stuff, very clean and bright salon.
I like when my toe nail cleaning is on the gentler side, and Vivian did just that perfectly!!
I've had rougher experiences in the past at other salons and that will definitely make me give a smaller tip, but I like a softer touch.
I'm definitely going back to this place in a few weeks!
The ONLY reason I gave 4 stars is because I'm quite stingy with 5 stars.
I've never had a superwowthisblewmeoutofthewater kind of pedicure, so I'll save that last star for when that actually happens...probably on my wedding day or something =]

Heh.
I got my toes done here the other day.
I saw that they give long massages.
The woman didn't do a massage at ALL.
She sort of patted at my legs like her hands were wet noodles, then put on super hot rocks- and not even for more than 30 seconds.
at that point, I was timing her.
She was speaking in her language, and I'm dead certain it was about me..
Furthermore, my nails were marked up underneath the polish.
She asked me if I wanted a pink over coat, and I didn't get it.
Also, she was NOT happy I didn't go with her ridiculous up selling.
I was so angry I forbade my husband to leave a tip- something I never do.
I had a groupon.
My nail place over at 7 day spa is my favorite place to go, but it's very expensive.
I was HOPING I had found a place to go for good- as I always get a deluxe pedicure.
It's too bad, too, because the pricing was decent, but it's not worth it, not being treated like that.
Good riddance, people.
You probably could have found a good customer.
I"ll take my extra 20 and go back where I'm appreciated.
Hasta la vista, Babies.

This place looked great and has good reviews but I was not impressed with the final product.
My sister and I used the groupon and we were excited to have some pampering time.
We both got pedicures and they were so sloppy!
I give myself a better pedicure than what I received at this place.
Even after them cleaning up their mess, there still was polish on my toes, outside of the nail.
Not to mention that the polish chipped in less than a week, which is something that never happens when I do my own pedicure.
They seemed like nice people but overall, I was extremely disappointed with the final product and will not recommend this place.

I took my best friend here as a treat since she was visiting from out of town.
When we arrived there was no wait and we got seated right away in luxurious massage pedicure chairs.
We got a gel mani ($25) and regular pedicure (17.99).
The prices were very reasonable!
My gel nail looked good for about a week and 1/2.
I would recommend this place!

I am happy with the service my cousin and I received from this Nail Salon.
The salon is very nice and my cousin's toes and eyebrows and my toes eyebrows, and nails look great!
I bought the 40$ groupon and I did not feel as though I was treated any less because I came in with it.
The girls were very attentive to both of us and my designs on my gel manicure look great!
The girl who did my toes had an attitude that made it seem like she did not want to be there, I must not lie, but her work definitely did not show it.
The girl who did my cousin's toes and my gel manicure was a total sweet heart and went above and beyond what we asked of her and I am grateful that she did!
Our eyebrows look great and the woman (who may have been the owner or the owner's wife) did not say much but she was focused so that is no big deal.
If I ever need my nails done while I am in Tempe, I would be happy to visit again.

Terrible service.
Will never be back.
I had the guy in there.
He wasn't even paying attention to anything.
I have one side that is a different length thank the other, not gel, and told me they were dry and they weren't and they paint is all scrunched.
Worse decision ever to come here.
I went in to get my money back and the girl angel noticed the problem nails but refused to give me my money back.
She kept ignoring me and then lied to me when she told me the owner/manager was out of town and then why I asked for the owners phone number for the 5th time angel then have me the managers sons number.
Such a waste of time and money.
:( never will I be back.
All about money and terrible service!

I have waited a little over a week to write this review, because to me the longevity of your mani and/or pedi means a lot.
I only have been to Nice Nails once for a pedi (a groupon).
It has been a week and a few days and my pedi still looks nice.
There are only one small chip on my big toe and all toe nails are still shiny.
If my overall experience had been better I would have given them 5 starts.
My experience: The groupon required an appointment, so my friend I was going with & I made one.
We arrived 5 mins before our appointment and came in with a group of walkins who were taken to the pedi chairs.
My friend & I waited until at 4:15 to be seated and waited an additional 10 mins with our feet soaking before the pedi started.
First off putting thing that happened is that one of the techs was facetiming on her iPad with a relative.
The iPad was facing 1/2 of the clients in the pedi chairs as the tech had her back to her relative to facetime with her.
It was just a little awkward and they were both talking loudly.
Second off putting instance was when it came down to discussing what was involved with the Groupon.
the Groupon was for a Deluxe Spa Pedi which was a $30 value.
The issue is that they offer 3 Deluxe Spa Pedicures ranging from $30 to $17.
I assumed we were getting the services included in the $30 Deluxe Spa Pedi since their Groupon said it was a $30 value.
That assumption was incorrect.
The $30 Deluxe Spa Pedi came with callus remover where as this one did not and was an extra $5.
While discussing this with my technician, who did not say anything, 2 other technicians jumped into the conversation making it a mess (this would be my 3rd issue).
I really wanted the callus remover for I paid the $5 for it.
The rest of the experience went pretty smoothly & my tech did a really good job with the hot stone, the callus remover, and the salt scrub.
If it had not been for the 3 issues above I might have given this place 4 stars (I did not really care of the location), but my pedi still looks good.
I might still give this place another chance to see if maybe what I experienced is not the norm.

Such great service!
My girlfriend and I were very happy with the results of our eyebrow wax and pedicures.
They took their time and were very friendly.
The patience of the staff was tested by a rude returning customer that was loud and demanding.
They still treated her with kindness despite her attitude and she soon calmed down.
Very classy and well done!

I have been to Nice Nails a few times and I think they are great!
In the past I have always just gone to any nail shop that was most convenient at the time.
After the few experiences with them I will continue to make them my regular nail shop.
My nails always look great!!
My eyebrows look good and my nails last!
The people who work there remember me and are always nice.
I highly recommend Nice Nails!

Long has done my last three pedicures here.
She is attentive, and very careful.
I got the deluxe pedicure (there is a coupon online, but otherwise it's $50!!
) with regular polish and loved it.
If you can get a coupon, they're inexpensive, but without a coupon a little unreasonably priced.
Be sure to tell them before hand, or they will charge you the full price.
Other than that, great nail techs, good range of polish colors, clean, and pretty good price!
The only thing I don't like about them is not keeping their appointments.
Don't bother making an appointment, because they won't keep it.
If they're open they'll take you, if you have an appointment, but they're full, they'll make you wait anyway.

Got a full set of Gel Acrylic.
Service was nice.
With no hurry she took 70 minutes start to finish.
Took me right away.
I have short, brittle nails with bad cuticles.
I was hoping for a really good manicure first where she really cleaned them up and didn't happen.
The nails and acrylic don't go all the way back so I expect I will need a fill sooner than 2 weeks.
(see pink sparkle picture for what was done.
)  I still haven't found  place that builds the nail up first then applies the acrylic for those that have short nails.
I would gladly pay for that good of a job.
Like I said, overall good attentive service, focused and not pushy.
Wasn't really busy at lunch time.
But the over all nail itself if only okay and was 35$ and I gave a 7$ tip.
No really good cuticle clean up or buff, I didn't get any e-oil or lotion or hand massage either and I was not in a hurry.
She knew this as well.
no bells and whistles, just the basics and your out.
