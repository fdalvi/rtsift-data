I went there last night with the guys, had a really nice time the music was very chill not the usual all metal crap it was a good mix from rise against to atmosphere to 50 cent......didn't try the hookah although they had a separate area with couches to smoke which looked very nice...also carried arcade games in the back room alongside the 8ft pool tables and the 10ft tables near the counter....had a good time definitely will stop by again sometime.

I went last night with a buddy of mine, I'm not sure how busy it gets on the weekend, but on a Wednesday night it was really relaxing and quiet.
We shot some stick, smoked one of the house mixes for shisha in the Hookah.
All in all a great time.
We'll see if I head out on a weekend, I'm a little old for the loud pool hall scene these days.

Hookah, pool, snacks, and friendly staff.
I wish this place was closer to me, because I would DEFINITELY be a regular.
The guy running it knows his stuff and knows how to treat patrons.
What more do you need?
I was visiting friends and found this place after trying to find somewhere with bellydancers.
No bellydancers were to be had during the time I ended up there, but they may have them on other nights.
It's an interesting venue: industrial feel, but with way comfortable clubby-style seating.
Also their bathroom is REALLY clean.
[Always a bonus!
] I'm also not sure if this place is now called "Silver Q" or "Trickshot", but whatever the name, it's a good venue.
Spacious, comfy, fun, and not too loud (unlike some hookah lounges I've been to).
Go!
