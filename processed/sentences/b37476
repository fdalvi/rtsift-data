Awesome service, fast and reasonable price .
Will definitely recommend to my friends & co-workers.

Made an appointment at 10am, came early at 9, finished by 9:50.
Gave me great tune up instructions.
Cheaper than other garage companies.
Called other garage repair companies recommended on yelp that had more and better reviews than this, and the price quote beats all of them.
Showed me how bad my gears were.
Recommended better products as well.

This is a couple of weeks overdue, but I wanted to make sure to get this in.
Would recommend calling Garage Door Doctor to anyone who needs this service.
Mike is honest and great on price!
Made appointment for 8:00 a.m on a Tuesday morning and was right on time.
Done in 45 mins with everything.
Really the kind of honest and open service you wish you could get all the time!

I concur with the three reviews below.
Awesome service, a great price, knowledgeable, fast and reliable.
He answered all the questions I had concerning my garage door.
I called six of Yelps top rated garage repair companies and the only one to actually answer the phone was Garage Door Doctor.
The other had voicemails, which only two eventually called back.
Glad I looked deeper into the pages of Yelp and found this company.
He (I believe his name was Mike) came out the same day and fixed all the problems with my garage door.
So relieved that I didn't have to leave my garage open overnight to the weather or possibility of someone stealing anything out of it.
Highly recommend this company.
Call them first !!
Thanks Garage Door Doctor
