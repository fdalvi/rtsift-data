If you work in an office and have to dress business casual, NY & Co is your place to shop.
Some of their stuff can be a bit plain but more often then not, they have modest, cute, stylish, business casual clothes at an affordable price.
I don't think I have ever been bugged by a salesperson when coming to this store which is actually kinda nice.
I can't stand salespeople following me around chiming in about how cute something is (see my review on Coach in LV).
Lastly, they have a great display of accent jewelry which is my weakness.
Everything is always really different and fun so I can't resist and usually walk out with several pieces.
The next time you are trying to find a place to shop, try NY & Co.
There is something for everybody   :)

Actually, my wife is the fan.
I'm not a clothes person.
If it fits, is simple and comfortable...I'm good.
I don't go for fashion at all.
But my wife seems to like the fashion here, and she especially likes the numerous sales they have.
The staff is busy, but tries to be helpful.

As long as I've been working in an office I've been shopping at NY&Co.
Its affordable clothing that lasts the test of time and they have really good sales.
Like the day I came here I bought dress slacks - buy one get one FREE.
I also wanted a 3/4 sleeve blazer that I found online but they didn't have it in stock so I went to the NY&Co at Chandler Fashion Square.
This store is very clean and orderly, the sales staff was great.
