Stealth Denny's    -           These 5 stars are Denny's 5 stars.
This is as good as a Denny's restaurant gets.
Plus the Flying J (recently bought by Pilot) has a bright, sparkly tower of Swarovski and fine Chinese blown glass and crystal Objet  d'hearts right at the Denny's entry.
This Denny's is huge, tall, well-lit, nicely decorated and seems brand new.
Because it serves truckers and travelers, right cooking, all dishes all the time, and good service have been well-taught.
If you can ignore the baconalia and cheese-a-thon items, the menu has newer, healthier items added.
We've had complicating life issues for 18 months keeping us out late most  nights.
Denny's is always 24/7, the menu is dependable and affordable.
We know Phoenix 24/7 eateries.
One other bonus about this roaad-travelers Denny's - that rancid flat -panel webcast perfectly named "The Bite"  does not run here.
Never forget, a Flying J has fuel plus more items in stock than you'll ever imagine you'll need.
This one, being a metro stop is toned down.

The parking here blows.
And is now getting worse with the instalation of the LNG station in the parking lot.
The denny's is one of the best I have been to.

Probably one of the cheapest places to get petrol in town.
If I'm in need of fueling The Tank and I'm on my mom's side of town....I stop by here.
