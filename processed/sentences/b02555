I first visited Ray's when I had mower problems years ago and I've been a regular customer ever since.
They are your one-stop shop for tuneups, blade sharpening or assistance in getting your mower running again.
Great service and reasonable prices.
I would recommend Roy's to anyone.

Nice couple!
Quick service.
inexpensive repair.
HARD TO FIND...make sure you go IN BETWEEN the nurseries...HIGHLY RECOMMEND for small engine repair and tune up:)  I'll be back!

I've been going here for a little bit to get various parts for my fine old classic TroyBilt tiller.
Very good service, very useful over-the-counter advice, and reasonable prices on parts or parts that had to be ordered.
I may need to have professional help with the tiller, and this is the place I'll take it.
If you knew me and my tiller, you'd know that's a serious recommendation.

Great customer service, fair price, the work was done when they said it would be done and it was done right.
Very happy with them, wouldn't hesitate to use them again and would certainly recommend them.
