Great store, great service, and great selection.
This stores is beautiful, even more beautiful are it's dressing rooms.
I recommend trying something on, just for that purpose.
Overall, the selection is nice, I think they also have a great men's selection.
The most recent time I went (after xmas) they were having a sale, which is always nice.
The sales people were very helpful, but not pushy.
I am surprised that the prior reviewer said they were not acknowledged.
I was within second upon entering.
I love Dolce and Gabanna so of course I will go back...Love me my Italian Fashion

I do love D&G I just havent been lucky getting styles I love the past yr.
This store is great.
