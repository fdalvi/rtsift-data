I have visited this store many times in my efforts to keep all my old vehicles going.
They are knowledgable & always get me the part I'm lookin for.
I rarely have to wait in a line like Autozone.
When you need an auto part, see Napa on Trop.

With all the auto parts stores here in Vegas it was hard to find a store that wasn't run by kids that know nothing about cars or shady parts.
Finally I found a store I can trust and is very knowledgeable.
Plus they go out of their way to make sure they get the part when they say they will.
Thank you Cindy and your sales team for great service.

Great place to buy auto parts
