Scott, the owner, is very professional.
He was extremely flexible in helping me to get exactly what I needed for my website graphics and video project.
You can't beat his prices, especially considering the quality of work and equipment he brings.
He had some really great ideas for my business in addition to his talents at website design and video production.
I will definitely use his expertise in the future!

I am so happy that I had Open Aperture film our wedding!
Our wedding video is flawless.
It deserves an Oscar.
Scott is friendly, helpful, professional and absolutely AMAZING at his job.
I HIGHLY recommend that you hire him to film any of your big events.This is not an area you want to skimp on.
Wedding flowers die and DJs play the same old songs but your video will be around forever.
He will do everything you hoped for and more!
WARNING!!
Book him NOW before Hollywood scoops him up.
I'm not kidding.
He is destined for success!

In all honesty I couldn't have asked for a better video shoot.
Scott was very professional, and when he gave you a certain time-frame for everything to be done, it got done.
He does it all from website design to social media marketing.The quality of my music video was just outstanding.
Just pick up the phone and give him a call, look no further!
I see see us working on future projects together and I hope you choose to go with him for your future projects as well.
