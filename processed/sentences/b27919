Worked with Courtney as a vendor (photo booth owner) at a wedding last weekend.
One of the smoothest weddings we have ever worked!
Like a Swiss watch, all of the pieces fell into place seemingly effortlessly.
I wish I had known her last year when both of my daughters got married...I would have used her in a heart beat.

Courtney Smith Broadhead/CCS Designer Events was truly a dream weaver for our daughter and son-in-law's wedding!
We will forever be grateful for her creativity, attention to detail and caring, professional manner throughout the planning process.
Additionally, just knowing that Courtney was there to seamlessly direct the events of the day allowed my husband and me to bask in the joys of our daughter's wedding.
Courtney was fully prepared for wedding day mishaps, including needle, thread and sewing skills to repair the maid of honor's dress!
Courtney's referrals for floral, DJ and lighting, linens and tableware, vintage furniture rental, and limousine and vintage car transportation were top notch too!
We highly recommend Courtney and her team for any and all special event planning and execution!!
