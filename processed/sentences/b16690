Always a great experience.
The staff is friendly and hard working.
The store is one of the cleanest in town.
$5 Foot long sandwiches are great for a inexpensive lunch or dinner.

Good for a quick bite to eat.
I think it is the right amount for lunch.
I love the breakfast sandwich with the egg whites and spinach with a little of mayo and light mustard.
For lunch time the Pastrami is yummy.
Have them heat the pastrami separate.
no toasting, seems like the bread gets dried out and falls apart.
I live the bread nice and soft.
add cheese of your choice and I like my spinach an lots of black olives, black pepper, mayo and mustard and about four to five of jalape√±os for a kick of flavor.
I love it this way every time I go for a subway sandwich.
If you like pastrami try it my way.
I love it and it's not full of other vegties, and spinach is a healthier with fiber.....lol enjoy.
