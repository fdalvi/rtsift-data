Wonderful service very delicious and healthy.
Very much recommend.
Food is amazin.
Can't wait for the entertainment bon Saturday

These guys are really close to a 5 star.
There were a couple of personal preference things for me, but overall it was really good.
The chicken was very tender and juicy, the lamb was cooked very nicely, the steak was a little over done and I'm not sure about the flavor/marinade, but that might just be a preference thing.
The staff is pretty friendly and since this was the first day they were actually open, which means any reviews prior to mine weren't from the regular public!
If you read any of my other reviews I think you'll know I am pretty fair.
Funny thing is, I was actually heading to Frijoles to give them another chance when I saw this place open, and since I love kebabs/kebobs, I couldn't resist.
I like the mediterranean salad, but I would love it if it were a little more simple.
I'd go a little easier on the peppers and the onions and are all of the herbs really necessary?
Plus they were a little heavy handed with them.
Again, simplify it, maybe a little more acid and you've got a hit.
Will definitely be back and I think these guys have the makings to be successful.
This place was Opa (disappointing) and then Plaka (never tried), but they are not affiliated with either and they've done a lot of work to clean up the place.
I would do more to shade those west facing windows and get yourself a door chime so people can hear you are there.
Like always with small business I'm rooting for their success.
FYI, call Discount Air, they are a very good, fair, and reliable a/c company.

I had the seafood kabob.
It was very tasty salmon and shrimp.
I also particularly liked the rice which had some little pasta throughout it.
Good quality food - I recommend it.
