She was my  pediatrician until I was 18.
Fantastic lady.
She'll help you out in any way that she can.

We see Dr Barcellona at that office and OMG!
Words could never express what a lifesaver he is-and the whole office is amazing.
I took my son there at 8 weeks.
He was in so much pain and screamed 24/7.
His main pediatrician said he was "fussy".
Dr Barcellona quickly identified the problem and my son is now a happy 8 month old.
Amazing place, don't think twice...take your kids here!

Love, Love Dr. Z!
She is great!
Interested in taking care of the patient and is good in answering questions.
Other Dr's are good, but you have to experience each for yourself to see who will work best for you and your child.
Ask tons of questions, and get answers!
Also, the website is helpful in answering many of the questions I have :)
