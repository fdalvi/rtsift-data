Great bank, super friendly staff and, well, there's always candy LOL.
Can't beat that.

Customer service depends on when you go and what location.
I have never been in the Fort Apache location, I only go through the drive up ATM machine.
There is never a line, I get to sit in my car and it takes two minutes, no hassle!
love it!

I've been coming here for the last 6 months or so but only once a month for business reasons.
Let me just say how much I HATE BOA.
EVERY SINGLE time I come here they always have a long line and only 1-2 tellers, WTF?!
seriously though, you would think they would want to actually provide customer service by cutting the lines in half and adding more tellers to make the lines go faster but I guess not.
This is exactly why I do not bank with BOA.
If I didn't have to come here once a month then trust me, I sure as hell wouldn't be coming back.
Oh and did I mention they don't even have a drive-thru window for teller assistance?
