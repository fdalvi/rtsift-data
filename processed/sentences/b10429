Located in the Orleans Hotel, this classy and colorful dining spot is a refreshing change from the endless buffets that seemingly connect one end of the Vegas Strip with the other.
The cuisine is more traditional than nouvelle, with long-time Italian favorites cramming the menu.
Among the dozen or so pasta options, penne with chicken, spinach, artichoke hearts, and tomatoes in a Parmesan cream sauce is a real standout.
House specialties include eggplant parmesan, veal marsala, peppercorn rib eye steak, and a variety of pizzas in solo or family sizes.
Portions are on the large side, and prices are very reasonable.

This mediocre, at best, restaurant has closed.
