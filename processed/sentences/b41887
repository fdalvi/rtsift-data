I stumbled upon this up and coming food truck with a twist on everything Cheese.
If you get a chance to try them.
Order the daddy's on a roll, The Hangover, and The Me so Cheesy!
Really, really great food at a great price.
I found my new favorite Vegas food truck!

This place is delicious!
I experienced their awesome Capreasy sand which and Vegas strips.
My friend got the Mac and cheese egg rolls and the sauce that came with them was something I had never tasted before and it was so good I'll definitely be back.

If you love cheese you will love the food they serve.
The Jam On It is to die for, Bacon & cheese lovers will love this sandwich.
I'am definitely going back next time I'am in town.
