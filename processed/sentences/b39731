It's what you'd expect from an IHOP, pancakes for everyone's taste.
Although in the maryvale area (hood); I like that its always busy which translates to fresh food.
Always a wait but worth it for cheap pancakes and a balloon artist for the kids.
Forego the hashbrowns for the country potatoes; crispy seasoned yummness.
Dress code: it's ihop so anything goes; even pajamas

I would have gave them a NEGATIVE stars if they had them.
Continuos horrible service, rude and all we ever get is a "I am sorry" from the manager.
We keep coming back hoping for a change.
But it never changes.
We will NOT be coming back here.
We will take our money to cocos (which is across the street) IHOP is officially on my "most horrible restaurants" DONT GO HERE, safe your money and time...

This place sucks I found 7 hairs on my dish .
Between the batter of the pancake the egg and even my coffee what kind of shit it this if give out a -5 slow service and the waitress have their hair all over the place that explains the hairy plate
