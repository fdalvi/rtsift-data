The drive-up ATM almost never has a line.
Location has regular "bank hours" for walk-in/in-person transactions.
I find it convenient to turn into this location while traveling northbound on Scottsdale Road.
I like the new scanning feature for depositing checks!

Very convenient location near Kierland and Scottsdale Quarter shopping areas.
The drive up ATM and teller windows are perfect for banking on the go.
I've never walked inside because I don't have to here....perfect.

I have been with Wells Fargo Bank since 1988...I was interested in a Mortgage for a Purchase...I was introduced to Michael Jordan (Mortgage Consultant)..Let me give you some advice  ,stay away go somewhere else..The lack of service , replies to my emails or phone calls was horrendous...I am 24 yrs with this Bank, 800 Fico Score and can't imagine how he or they treat customers that have not banked with them...His Superior that sits at the Wells Fargo Home Mortgage (16211 N Scottsdale Rd., Ste A-1 | Scottsdale, AZ 85254 ) who I spoke to about Michael Jordan is a waste..Linda Baker the Loan Doc Specialist treated me like I have never conducted business with the Bank...Stay away fro m these people and Wells Fargo Bank..I will be closing all of my accounts....

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED!!!!!
I have been a member with Wells Fargo since 2006 and WITHOUT FAIL every 6 months or so I receive charges that should not have been there.
And EVERY TIME I go to this branch to resolve a problem every team member has an attitude and ends up telling me there is nothing we can do about it!!!!
I just had an issue today and it was the straw the broke the camels back.
I am now a proud member of the Chase Bank right across the street!!!!
