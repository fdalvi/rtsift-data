Now my local gym.
They have a great wee mix of gym gear, free weights, treadmill, cross trainer, rowers etc.
with the pool and sauna it's makes for a great wee work out :)

Dalry leisure centre feels a bit more hidden than some of the other Edinburgh Leisure centres, and for that reason possibly it never seems as busy as other places, which is great when I go swimming!
Anytime I've been there it seems to be mostly adults as well, though this could just be to do with the times I happen to go there.
It's a fairly small centre with the gym being in a small room, and the pool is 25yards long which isn't very big but it's perfect if you don't mind turning.
I haven't experienced the gym as much so I can't comment on it.
