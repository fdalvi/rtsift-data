If you are looking for cheap eats, this is a great place to go.
Each night of the week they have a 99 cent special.
It could be anything from a tostada, nachos, to a burrito.
Don't the let cheap price fool you, the nachos are a very large portion.
Their other food choices are good too.
I like the carne asada and the carnitas.
The joint is right next to the bar Money Plays, with a door that passes between the two.
They also have great graveyard specials too.
It's not the fanciest place in town, just a decent place to kick back and have some cheap food.

For the price, you can't beat it.
The food is Incredibly cheap and super good.
There's also more than one item on the menu that can be eaten by a vegetarian, a plus for me!
A bar called Money Plays is next door and that's plus because of the alcohol opps but it sucks to smell cigs while eating or hearing bad karaoke if you are there on the wrong night.

it's a pick-up taco stand inside a bar-about 10 person seating-with nice murals & bar decor.
kinda of skanky dirty dive suprise!
suprise!
very spicy & super tender meat almost like pot roast.
mex mix(pico) was spicy!!
hamburger was like you bbq it yourself-yummy.
mushrooms a little overdone & greasy.
chimichanga & bean tostadas were delicous!!
real good food for a bar.
especially if your inebriated!!
Did I forget to mentio they deliver 24/7!!!
i wish they would get rid of the styrofoam container all ready-it just kills food!

Wait a min...Ok,  here is a place for some good late night grub!
This is your standard Mexican joint attached to a bar!
Which really helps while sitting there trying to debate if Jack in the Box or Del Taco is in order after a few brews.
For all the frugal drunks out there, they have grave-yard special!
For $6.00 you get.... 2 pints of beer...STELLA!!!
next door, @ Money Play's and a item off the limited special menu.
But on with the real deal....the food!
It's not really too bad, I've had the opportunity to try a variety of items..
But the true standout is.... the Carne Asada Torta!
It's not to say the standard  variety of nachos, taco, burritos, and etc.
is not good, in fact it is pretty good.
Go back for the prices, quality of the food, & enjoy the ride!

Fresh Mex Open 24hour + free delivery  Unbelievably inexpensive and pretty tasty!
What more could you ask for if you're up playing poker online?!
The fish tacos were delicious, ended up getting a combo.
Unfortunately you'll need to add lime and salt to their guacamole it has very little flavor, and don't forget to ask for hot salsa - the house salsa is pretty mild.
Date Rating: N/A (still haven't been to the actual location) Pick up Scale: N/A (I'm sure you can meet interesting locals here late night)  Strong Suggestion: Order from here when you're starving.

This is a great place to go when going to Las Vegas to get good food without spending too much money.
I try and make two stops here when I vacation.
The people here are generally friendly and the food is relatively fresh.
I did have a couple incidences though.
I had my sandwich order switched from french fries to salad, and in two cases the salad wasn't very fresh at all.
Also, the price of their subs went up a dollar making it $7 instead of $6.
For that reason, I brought it down from a 4 rating, down to a 3.
If my experiences improve from here, I'll raise it up to 4 again.

Total hole in the wall Mexican food place.
I'm from Socal and this place definitely hits the spot.
Carintas plate is the only thing I order because it's amazing, haven't tried much of the other stuff yet.
Not a place I'd recommend dining in, so definitely go with take out or delivery.

I order from El Taco Fresco quite often.
They're open 24 hours, they deliver late, the service is good, the food is inexpensive, and its YUMMYYY!!!
My favorite is the chicken chimichanga combo.. delicious!
The combos are nice in size and are very well priced.
They even have 99cent churros!

I love El Taco Fresco.
I love that it's attached to a great bar, I love that it's some of the best Mexican food I've ever had (and yes, I've been to Mexico), and I love that it's super cheap and always open.
My boyfriend and I go to Taco Fresco and Money Plays a lot.
We always order at the counter and sit in the bar.
Our food is brought to the bar within 10 minutes, usually less.
The food is excellent; we usually go for tacos.
The chicken taco is great because the tortilla is fried.
It's greasy, but delicious.
The carne asada is a no-brainer.
Just order one.
I think it's actually the cheapest taco on the menu, which makes no sense, but I'm not complaining.
My favorite, carnitas, has to be done right.
This place does it right!
I'm pretty sure the meat is boiled, then shredded, then deep fried or maybe fried on a flat top in lots of oil.
Anyway, it's fantastic, but be prepared to have pork breath for the night.
You have to try the rolled tacos.
They're taquitos stuffed with shredded beef, topped with cheese, and served with guac and sour cream.
They're a given anytime I go to Taco Fresco.
I don't eat the American food they offer because I love the Mexican stuff so much, but I did have a friend say that their burger was great, and I tried a french fry- not bad.
They do deliver, but I've never actually taken them up on that, because it's such a fun place to go to eat and drink.
If you need dinner and some drinks in a casual setting, check out Taco Fresco and Money Plays.

What can I say about El Taco Fresco that hasn't already been said?
It's incredible.
The food is great, it's crazy cheap--especially if you get a couple of their $0.99 specials with your order--and ready fast.
I don't think I've ever had to wait more than ten minutes for food, if that.
It's open 24 hours a day, with 24 hour delivery.
The menu is pretty varied.
They have a lot of vegetarian options, which makes someone like me happy, but they have even more to make you omnivores happy!
I usually get either veggie tacos, the bean and cheese burrito, or the cheese enchilada and I am always happy.
My boyfriend loves their beef taco salad.
It's a hole-in-the-wall kind of place, but that kind of enhances the Taco Fresco experience, if you ask me.
I definitely recommend it.

Perfect spot for a cheap but excellent meal.
We usually order, grab a beer at the bar next door and head back to eat.

I judge these Mexican dive places on what I call the "Shit Factor".
If I get sick to my stomach, no matter how tasty it was-I am never gonna go back.
That being said, I did like the salsa-not the green or red that is on the salsa bar, but the one you get when you order the chips or a taco salad.
I had the pork chile verde.
It was seasoned SO STRONGLY of cloves and oregano, that I couldn't stand to eat it.
I did finish everything on my plate except the meat, which it what I suspect made me sick.
The usual suspect for me is lettuce at Mexi-dives.
My plate came with quite a bit and went well with the chips and salsa.
However, I think they left the pork to stew too long at too low a temp.
Tape worms anyone?
The owner was super nice and even shut the door to the bar when some guy was being a real asshole.
(We had kids with us)   Remember my Mexi-dive criteria?
Let's just say I decided not go back rather quickly and violently.
Eve N, what are you thinking?
That bar is disgusting!
I used their bathroom and I am not kidding about this: there was a hooker quietly servicing a male client just out the back door.
i know what I heard!
Plus the place smelled like a mixture of urine, grease, and really nasty cigarette smoke.

now its called El Taco Feliz  got me the Mechaco beef burito!
no guac.
it was really f*&#((&$^@king good  and yes cheap prices.
awesome food

Good food and it's open late....perfect!
We stopped by here a few weeks back and we weren't disappointed.
We got the chicken and beef taco, and the prices are decent!
The inside of this place isn't the greatest which almost makes you want to leave, but the food was good.

dissapoint on pricing, food didnt satisfy the spot,.2.star.for friendly staff

Yes, very very good!
I recommend the shredded beef burrito.
With a lot of nice melted cheese in it, this burrito is a handful of heaven.
And if you like carnitas - their carnitas is superb - delicious!
I also recommend the veggie burrito.
I am not vegetarian, but I like a packed burrito with lots of lettuce, etc!
The veggie burrito is packed and really really good.
You can add ingredients to any burrito for an extra charge.
So, theoretically, you can order a veggie burrito and add meat to it...although, this seems to not ever turn out quite right...otherwise the burritos don't have much else in them other than the meat...each burrito comes with one or two additional ingredients depending on which one you order.
...Uniquely flavored rice and red salsa.
Not my favorites, but uniquely flavored.
I love their green sauce, though...

The best Mexican food in town and they deliver too

We decided to try it out for the first time yesterday 06-01-11.
Prices were reasonable.
I tried the chili verde burrito, and it was delicious.
My co-worker tried a carnitas chimichanga and he loved it.
I was really surprised, I been looking for a authentic joint around town and I finally found one down the street.

Needed some quick, cheap, good food after a long tiring day.
I was wary of Vegas Mexican food, since living in SD/near East LA has raised my expectations for hole-in-the-wall, best-after-11pm Mexican food.
Tiny little place with just a few booths, Francisco the "waiter" (& possibly cook) was hospitable & even brought a gallon jug of water to our table for our group of 6.
The food was exactly what we were looking for.
I had a full-plate of nachos supreme (chips w/ shredded chicken, carne asada AND shredded beef, topped w/ beans, cheese, sour cream, guac & pico de gallo).
Others ordered fish taco, carnitas burrito, chorizo combo plate, beef fajitas combo plate, and chile verde burrito.
Everything was good, but my sister especially liked the carnitas.
Combo plates were ~6.99 and came w/ rice, beans, lettuce, tortillas.
Horchata came from the soda fountain though.

*****2011 Entertainment guide...buy one get one free meal coupon***** Is listed as El Taco Fresco, they will still accept the coupon.
Great food!
I have eaten here for the last three years, then my co-workers started ordering for lunch delivery once a week at the office.
Yeah it's good stuff I got them hooked!
Rolled tacos guacamole and cheese please...
Beef burrito with green chile pepper chunks please...  Tacos please chicken or beef (hardshell) please...  Enchiladas please...  Mmmmmmm Nummy

decent chicken, unfort everything else was disgusting.
the steak was dry, the "beef???
" tasted foul  overall bad food for overpriced prices and mediocre portions.
upside, open 24 hours bad side, you have to be drunk to tolerate the food

This is a huge favorite I have been going to for years.
The dive bar next door is a great place that only serves beer, has great bartenders and sometimes rocks live music - and you can sit in there and they will bring your food over.
Or take out or dine in their area.
Now for the food, at first all I would get was a shredded beef burrito- enchilada style.
They do it right.
Then I saw someone with a steak quesadilla one night and we have been hooked on those ever since.
And I never order quesadillas - not something I generally dig - but the way they do it - with the cheeses they use - fresh, peppery steak, epic.
Their red salsa that is on the bar - not the hot - but the one with bits of cillantro in it - I don't know what they do to that but it's just wonderful and has a great flavor.
The shredded chicked in the tacos or burritos is always flavorful marinated mostly white meat.
The fish tacos are excellent.
They also make a chicken finger taco in a simelar style to fish and it is a uniqly addictive treat - especially for late night folks.
And that reminds me - they have a midnight special- after 12 they have a list of dishes you can get that comes with two beers from next door for $5.
The best deal going anywhere!

This used to be called El Taco Fresco, but I believe the brother, Antonio, bought it from his other brother, kept everything the same, but changed the name to El Taco Feliz.
This is damn good Mexican!
We were having a casual holiday work party and I went over to El Taco Feliz to talk with Antonio about catering the party.
Carnitas, Beef, Chicken, Beans, Rice, Guacamole, two kinds of Salsa, Cheese, Lettuce, Limes, Tortillas and Shells.
(I'm trying to think if I am missing anything...)  EVERYONE LOVED IT!!!!
(I even had Jersey Mike's subs and they were barely touched!
)  I'm not a pork person, but these carnitas were amazing!
The chicken was VERY good- moist and shredded and great flavor!
Beef had lots of flavor!
The salsa's are great, my favorite is RED HOT!
He dropped all of it off in this container that keeps food PIPING hot (and it did!!
)  I will DEFINITELY cater from them again.
Hands down, no questions!!!
Thanks Antonio & El Taco Feliz!!!
p.s.
if you go into the restaurant just for food, their Chicken Nachos are so delish!

At work we always  order lunch from El Taco Feliz  The food is ALWAYS delicious!
The price is always ECONOMICAL!
I have had their chimichanga lunch special.
It was a big burrito with shredded cheese and other yumminess, served with rice and beans.
The food was very flavorful and came with guacamole and pico de gallo .
Delish-us!
Pleasantly surprised as not only was it tasty and affordable.. they DELIVER!
That hits it out of the park for me!

Excellent food.
Delivered to my room at around midnight.

Delicious cheap mexican food!
Enough said!!!!!

Excellent food and the best caramel churro I've ever had.
Ever ever.
If you order after a night of weird liquor drinking at Money Plays (story for a different time...), they'll deliver it to you in the bar.
Food was good, nothing came back up to haunt me, and the caramel churro is something for the Fat Kids Hall of Fame Cookbook.
Serious business.

Unfortunately this review is downgraded to a 3 star rating.
Time for an update since I have been back a few times after my last visit.
As mentioned before their original dba was El Taco Fresco.
Everything is the same however I think they have trimmed the portion size of their food and increased prices a bit.
I often place my order then walk through the adjoining door to Money Plays bar and grab a beer and wait for my food which they will walk over to me when ready.
Mexican food and an ice cold beer is a very nice combination in my book and I am not much of a beer drinker.
We ordered rolled tacos, excuse me I mean taquitos as they call them.
In San Diego, CA where I am from the old school taco shops call them rolled tacos as they really are.
I never heard of the term "taquitos" until I moved to Los Angeles.
Anyhow, of course don't forget the cheese and guacamole.
Well just don't expect much cheese or guacamole as the amount was laughable and yes they charge extra for guacamole in which they are very stingy with.
Only two out of my five taquitos had enough guacamole to enjoy.
A pet peeve of mine is if you charge extra for it then make sure you give a fair amount.
They were tighter than a ticks as with the guacamole!
I was craving carne asada so I got a burrito this visit.
I was disappointed in the size as it was very small and not very meaty.
If I order a carne asada burrito I want to taste a decent amount of meat.
This burrito was the smallest and least filled I have ever had the opportunity to consume.
It did not even look right, it was so small and empty the shape was not even of a burrito but rather more similar to the shape of a pear.
I was very disappointed, thank goodness I split an order of "taquitos" with my sweetie or I would have left just as hungry as when I walked in.
I will give them some time and check back as I am turned off at the moment.
:(  The name change in my opinion has only brought higher prices and less food.

Well good late night food My BF and I Loved it!
I got the beef nachos and he got the deep fried burrito.
The guy that served us was really nice too.
I will be going back again.

The place needs an overhaul.
The salsa bar is wedged in the corner and it has probably felled a bunch of people with salsa being out without for awhile.
Move it away from that area and add some exciting stuff, not the usual watery green and red crap.
Does anybody have the balls to make some exciting salsa's in Vegas?
I usually get the Chicken nachos, but today I opted for chicken Burrito.
Strange in that the burrito only includes cheese I think and a veggie mix of peppers for $5.
I added rice for .50 cents, but burritos are not their strongpoint.
Was a pretty soggy burro all the way through and the tiny bit of rice they included had a hard time holding up the shredded chicken.
Kinda had a sour feeling after eating there today, but no permanent damage.
PLace just seems stale and needs a refreshing of some sort in the dining room.
eating at the bar is the way to go and what is with all the Ethopians or whatever crowding the sidewalk at that strip mall.
How do all these people get into our country?
No americans wil ever eat their food, so it's like they aren't really assimilating, they are just coming here opening up their own place and hanging out in front of their place all day.
What a country.
Oh yeah, burrito was kinda small too, for a buck more go to Chiptole and you will be full, but here stick to the nachos because those are actually worth the price.

I've lived in Vegas for 7 years, and when I first moved to town, I went to pretty much every hole in the wall Mexican restaurant looking for a place that could duplicate the taste of my favorite Mexican restaurant in San Diego (Sombrero, if you want to visit them and bring me back a burrito).
After 100 shitty burritos, I gave up on my quest.
Last month, I was on a dinner break at the World Series of Poker, and I was in the mood for Mexican.
I was driving down the street to one of the Lindo's, and I checked Yelp to see if there were any other decent Mexican places in the area.
El Taco Feliz came up with really high reviews, and only one dollar sign, so I decided to try it instead.
I am sooooooooo happy I did.
I ordered my usual (chicken burrito with rice and cheese), and sat down at the connected bar Money Plays.
They had green sauce, which was a huge plus.
Another huge plus?
IT WAS FUCKING DELICIOUS!
El Taco Feliz uses quality chicken, and the burrito was a pretty damn close replica of Sombrero's burrito.
I went back 3 times that week for the same order, and I now find myself heading down there when I need my fix.
It's also open 24 hours, though I brought some out of towners here at 3am one time and they were closed.
That was weird.

I grew up in San Diego where Mexican food is 2nd to none and a daily routine.
I moved to Europe about 7 years ago and Mexican food became a fantasy.
I went to Las Vegas this year to visit friends/family and found El Taco Feliz by accident as it was close to my hotel.
I ate there everyday for breakfast and dinner until my holiday was over.
Get the point?

We picked this place to eat because it was the only place close and open.
We ordered a lot of food and they were amazing.
I got the fish tacos which were great.
The Tortas were good too.
My friend got the quesadillas and they were the bomb.
We were not drunk either.
The fries sucked but the price made up for it.
Very cheap for what you pay for.

I haven't been here in a while but love this spot.
The super nachos are off the hook.
I haven't had better nachos here in las vegas from one of these fast food type joints.
They are HUGE, with chicken, shredded beef and carne asade.
The Machaca burritto is awesome too.
Everything is pretty good, even their friggin cheeseburger.. trust me.. they are good stuff.
Like it much better than robertos.

can't beat this place, especially for the price.
Chicken crispy taco was delicious!
This is a solid 4 star taqueria!

Every tale about drinking involves greasy food that makes you want to die.
El Taco Feliz is just that place.
You can get your drunk on and not get belligerent.
Connected to Money Plays, they give you the option to dine in or get it delivered next door.
The carnitas tacos are not super fatty and that is what I liked about them.
The massive amount of meat is also a plus.
For a couple of dollars, it is enough to fill up on less than $10.
The rolled tacos were okay.
When I am drunk.
anything fried is the way to go, but not these.
If Mexican does not sound good, that is okay.
They have wings, burgers, fries, and more.
At first, I did not see the Mexican fare in this hog pog collection.
Having a nibble of most of these items, it was a good option for the proximity.

Went her on Yelp recommendations.
But, the food was rather flavorless, and nothing special at all.
My enchilada and bean burrito combo was nothing special, and just tasted bland.
I wasn't impressed.

I was visiting Vegas and wanted some local fare off the strip.
This little place did not disappoint.
Delicious Mexican food for cheap.
I had the fajitas, which were excellent.

Stopped in to get a late night bit to eat.
Its off the strip and was easy to get to.
Had the chirizo plate and enjoyed it.
It was a good size portion of chirzo and eggs, beans, rice, and 3 tortillas.
Will stop by again and maybe I'll try the carnitas.

Had to pay for a styrofoam cup just so I can get water because they ran out of plastic water cups.

I just ordered food to go- haven't even tried it yet but this place already gets five stars simply for service.
I'm currently only eating paleo ( no grains, dairy, or sugar) and the owner let me trade items in and out to basically create a chicken fajitas place with only meat and lots of extra veggies with guac.
This meal will be fantastic

Really good cheap ass food.
Crazy loud bar next door, but got a huge dinner with drink, tac and tip for 8.50.
Definitely better than any "Mexican food" in Oregon.

I work in a weird part of town that is mostly industrial or fast food, and I became aware of this shop when they delivered a flyer to my office.
I've become a huge fan not only because I'm a Mexican food junkie, but I love that they'll deliver to my area.
Most of the fare is traditional, but they do have some American options for your less adventurous co-workers.
I have never had a bad meal here, and most have been great.
I particularly dig the chimichangas.

Soda was flat, didn't have any napkins out, poorly lit, dirty and there's much better options in Vegas.
By burrito barely had any meat in it and my fiancé didn't even want to touch her taco salad.

Good food.
Plus they deliver

Highly recommend the fajitas but if you're somewhat pressed on time be careful.
I had one 45 minute delivery turn into 1 hour and 35 minutes.
Besides the delivery mix ups they have once in a while the food is great at a great price.

Grabbed a couple of breakfast burritos this morning...
The burritos were pretty good but the guy put on plastic gloves to make the food, handled my money, then counted change and started making them with the same gloves on, yuck!
Lucky for him I was nursing a hangover and didn't feel like putting up a fight...
If guy would've removed or changed his gloves they'd have gotten 4 stars instead of 1 for the nasty health code violation.

Prices on the main menu are outdated.
Ordered an appetizer sampler (11.99 on menu) supreme nachos ($6.49) and 2 drinks.
My receipt did not have the prices on it.
I thought I heard $23 over the phone which sounded fair but it turned out to be $33.
They should update their prices, but if they did, I probably would not have ordered in the first place.The nachos were good but the items in the sampler were unseasoned and bland.
Rip off.

Haven't even eaten my food yet but I ordered it at 11:30pm when no one else was in there, and it still took a half hour for them to make me ONE thing.
Place is a little sketchy looking too   --  Update  I ate the food and it was decent.
So I boosted my rating from 1 star to 2.
Still wouldn't go back

**NOT A DRUNK REVIEW** LOL.
Yes, this place is next to a bar.
I come to eat here first AND THEN get hammered.
So I seriously remember what I've eaten here before.
LOL.
I've ordered a bunch of food here before.
Carne asada tacos, chicken nachos, carnitas burritos, burgers & fries, and chicken tenders.
Yup, they're all good.
Service is excellent.
If you tell the guy that you're at the bar, they will bring your food to you.
Would come back here...hammered.
LOL
