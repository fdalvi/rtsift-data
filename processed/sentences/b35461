They have great chicken tenders that always taste freshly made.
BUT if you go thru the Drive-Thru, always check your order before you leave.
The last three times I ordered the 5 piece chicken tenders, my order only had 3.
So either somebody doesn't know how to count in there, or it's done deliberately.
Whatever the reason, it's absolutely annoying and inconvenient to have to park and walk in just to get the two missing pieces.

Quick lunch and your coupons are expired, don't worry this Carl's has your back.
Many options and salads too.

It was clean!
It's Carls Jr for sake.
What do ya want?

I gotta say of all the fast food in cave creek, Carl's jr has been by far the best.
Only issue I have is that I ordered 1 double western bacon cheeseburger for $ 4.50 and just a western bacon cheeseburger (only has one patty) for 3.99.
Then I ordered 2 medium French fries for 2.50 each.
How is it that 2 medium fries are 5.00 and the double western burger is only 4.50.
Then, there's only .50 cents more for another patty??
Either way, French fries are wayyyyyy to expensive!
2.50 seriously??
Total was 15.00 for fries and hamburgers.
No, sodas.
Ridiculous.
Hamburgers were great however as always but then we totally also got shorted on the French fries.
Like we were there at 7 and they didn't wanna make more so they evenly distributed whatever they had left so I paid 5.00 bucks for basically 1 fry.
Wanna come back but feel ripped off.

OMG!
Stay away from this location, the bathroom is a mess!
The toliet seat is broken in half  and they were out of toliet paper except for the bunches on the floor.
I sent a email to Carl's Jr as well as calling their "guest" Hotline asking them to fix the problem before someone gets sick.
I asked to be contacted by the GM or district management, nope I did get a a very nice email from Carl's Jr COO Carl LeLecke tell me he was sending me some free food coupons...
I waited two days do post hoping the would fix the prooblem I went back in today and the toliel teat is still  the broken one and most of the toliet paper is off the floor.
You know what they say about bathroom conditions and clealiness of restaurants.
Yikes!!

I like Carl's Jr.
I do ... guilty pleasure on a rare occasion.
HOWEVER ... it's so sad when you pick up your order in the drive through ... $13.72 worth of food for two... and the $6 Jalape√±o burger tastes like the meat was cooked ... say ...  1/2 hour ago in Tijuana ... and not even kept under a heat lamp for the trip north ... and the fries ... are ... luke warm.
And the Teriyaki burger?
Tastes like it was glad to be on the ground from a long flight from Tokyo.
sad.
Next time I want to load up on carbs I'll head south to In-N-Out ... ya - that's it!
