Two stars.
Thats for a few reasons: Can't get out/in the parking lot without getting hit up for 'gas money' by people who are on bikes Dirtier than almost any other Circle K I've ever been to.
I'm from Arizona and they are as common as cactus.
Their soda fountain sucks.
I drink a ton of diet coke every day and they have the worst soda fountain I've been to.
Not closed.

Nice people inside, basically just a normal gas station/mart.
Only thing thats lame is thats its on a corner so its more difficult to get out of with traffic!
Loves it though!

Convenient (on the corner of a busy intersection) but competes with two other gas stations on neighboring corners.
Staff are usually friendly and they have a wide selection of snacks and beverages.
Gas is fairly priced and I usually fill up here.

Filthy store.
The pumps are all tagged, beat u and dirty.
The whole parkinglot was gross and filthy.
There is no pride in this establishment.
