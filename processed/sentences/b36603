This is a small coffee, tea, and boba cafe.
The staff is friendly and the drinks are pretty good.
Try the taro smoothie and you will not be disappointed.
They also make delicious smoothies with a large flavor menu to chose from.
My only complaint is that they use pumps of syrup for the flavoring instead of fresh fruit, but regardless, the smoothies are still good.

THT has to be the worst ice cream shop that I have been to.
I walked in expecting a varied of ice creams, and come to see that they do not have much to choose from.
I ask for the basic flavor strawberry and they did not carry it.
The person over the counter seemed confused and did not know what he was doing.
I did not even bother to order a smoothie seeing how bad the place looked.

Very friendly and have good boba tea drinks.
Small shop looking to expand into carrying different things, such as food.
Support local.
Vapor friendly.

Actually not bad.
The teas and shakes and pretty much everything seem solid.
Had a green tea milkshake w Boba and it was great.
Like someone else said Support Local!
