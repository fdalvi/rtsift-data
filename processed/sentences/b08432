Good neighborhood convenient store.
It's got the basics, and it's nice for a late-night Oreo run!
They have Mexican coke which is awesome.
I'm usually the only white person in the store but whatevs.

Appearance wise, Kwik Mart looks ghetto.
It's your typical off-the-main-street convenience store and carries your essentials.
It's within walking distance from my girlfriend's house, though I don't suggest we walk there.
The staff is nice every time and a good overall selection of items.
No reason to stop going!

.....the closest stop to my home just so happens to have the cheapest gas in Northern Phoenix.
2 minutes from door to door - what more can you ask?
