Friendly staff.
I was a walk in, waited a bit for a spa pedicure but who can complain sitting in a massage chair.
Vanessa did a cute french pedicure w a requested flower.
It was relaxing and a nice environment.
The staff was always asking if I was comfortable and even provided water.
Will be back.

This is a fabulous place!!
Super clean which is always a plus.
I was a walk in and I got in right away no waiting.
The gal that did my pedicure was awesome, she is a perfectionist which I most appreciate.
I am going back for my manicure next.

In a city with nail salons on every corner, customer service is essential.
Being the newest, "nicest" salon isn't enough.
Had the worst experience here with my son - the owner was beyond rude and treated us like crap.
The lady that did my nails was awesome, unfortunately his behavior was atrocious.
Total jerk.
