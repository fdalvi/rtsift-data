Speedee and I were having a good time.
Angled towards the corner of Desert Inn and Wynn, Speedee beckoned me with reasonably priced gas.
The signs proclaimed that I could find video poker and five cent slots within.
However, our relationship came to a harsh end when I pressed "Yes" for a receipt and it told me to pick it up with the cashier inside.
Dude, I have a crying baby.
I'm not going into your establishment to pick up my receipt.
I know that this is how it works in Vegas (they have to get you inside to gamble), but this was ridiculous.
PS: While searching for the address of this place, I found www.vegasgasprices.com which might be of interest to some.

the cashiers are rude.there are a lot of people outside begging for change and they do nothing about it.drug deals in the parking lot.drinking on the premises.i am scared to go there at night so i dont.
