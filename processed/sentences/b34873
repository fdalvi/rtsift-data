Ordinarily I wouldn't bother, but when I pull in for a fill-up and find that one island's pay terminal is not working at all (with taped-up handwritten signs that look like they have been there since Rikki Lake was still on daytime TV) and the other island's pay terminal is only accepting credit cards on one side, and when I try to enter my pump number at that one, single, solitary functioning terminal, it tells me pump 4 is busy when it obviously BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT is not (because I can see it still holstered about 12 feet away from me), I just gotta say something.
The prices on the gas are good.
Too bad you can't buy it.

I was intrigued by the low prices at all of the Arco's that I saw in the area, usually 10 cents less than anyone else.
This one does not have the option to pay at the pump, so I had to pay inside.
If you use a debit card, there is a 35 cent charge added to your bill.
Credit and cash has no additional charges.
Curious, but if you want to save money this is a good option.

Just picked up my lotto tickets.
Chelsea serviced me with a smile and greeted me when I walked through the door.
This location is a full service gas location.
They offer hot food, cold refreshing drinks, snacks, light grocery and toiletry items.
Very clean station with cheaper gas prices then most gas stations in the area.
