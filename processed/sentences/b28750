Inverkeithing Railway station is a place I would not recommend people to visit, there are plenty of other stations which posses' larger amounts of character and charm!
This frankly has little of both.
Firstly, this station is the busiest in Fife when it comes to the amount of commuters travelling to Edinburgh to work.
It is truly an awful experience in the mornings and in the evenings, when hundreds if not thousands of workers head for the trains!
The station is dull and uninspiring and its main building is like any replica public building made in the early nineties - architectural dull and grey!
However, it does match when with all the grey and dull suits of the workers who fill this place up to the brim!
The station also sits on Boreland Road, quite appropriate I think!
I would avoid this station at the rush hour times and well...that's it really, not a place worth visiting, just a station to pass on through!

Not the prettiest of stations, could do with an upgrade but inverkeithing station does the job!
It is very central, has a taxi rank just as you step of the train, and office with inside seating area.
This is a busy station and serves it purpose!
Inverkeithing isn't my favourite place but praise where it's due, it works very well as one of the busiest train stations in Fife.

It's got a free to use toilet and a newsagent inside.
What's not to like?
