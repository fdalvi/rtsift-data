My husband and I go here at least once a week.
It has just recently gone under new management and we couldn't be happier.
We have a one year old who gets kinda restless in restaurants and this place provides toys for them to play with.
The waitress we always have brings us crackers, fruit, pickles, etc.
to help us calm our restless baby girl.
The food is amazing!
Everything we have tried we LOVE (except the cole slaw... it was too mayonaisse-y)  Drink prices are awesome, I can't remember the exact prices, but cheaper than most bars/pubs.

Just had a great couple of hours at this newly reopened, and seriously cleaned up, sports bar in North Phoenix.
The place looks great and had a good vibe, the guy playing guitar was excellent, the fanatic burger was monstrous and delicious (yes they added chili to my burger ...oh my).
The bartender was friendly and gorgeous ...what's not to love?
Oh yes and the Suns game was on and several of us had a good time bemoaning the waste of a great second half Suns spurt.
I will definitely be back to this place, an easy place to hang out and have fun with friends.

A lot of TV's, so that's good.
The bartenders are really sexy and good mixologists.
And also it seems that Poker is a nightly event there.
Their Happy hour during the week is good, 2-4-1's on drinks, 1/2 off apps.
Their wings were good.
Classic style, unbreaded, thank god...
I also was there earlier this evening for the NBA Playoffs, had their Turkey club.
It was pretty... what's the word... typical.
store bought turkey, low grade lettuce.
So if you're trying to eat healthy, probably not the place for you.
I think this will be make local hangout!!
Peace out!
