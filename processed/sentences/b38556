My hair looks amazing.
Sheila did a great job as always.
She is friendly, professional and always on time.
I will be back!

Jeri is a magician with my hair.
All women know your hairdresser  is one of the mist important people in your life.
She is amazing, up to date on all the new styles abs tricks.
The salon is clean, huge and offers endless services.
I've only used Jeri.
But there is a pearl skin station and 100's of other services.
Great summerlin location.
Across from The Boca target.
Great French bakery next door for lunch before or after your 'me time'.
Hair products are also available for sale too.
Redken thicking lotion is a MUST have for people with thin, fine or limp hair!!
Although in a pinch you can buy it at Alta.
Jeri is always able to work around my schedule and always sends me reminders!!
A true jewel in summerlin.
Ask for Jeri!

The Body Spa has lots of independent contractors and many have individual yelp sites.
I clicked on the main spa instead of my stylists site which is "James and Gaye at Body Spa" so while I would give the 5 stars for great cut, color, styles, etc the overall spa I have to give 3 stars to since my only other experience was with initially getting in (the place is huge and checking in the first time was a bit off) and I had one mani-pedi that was just OK.
