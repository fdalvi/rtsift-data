Wow!
This girl is amazing.
She gave me a beautiful, totally original hair style that I absolutely loved and no way could have done myself.
Her ability with makeup is outstanding.
My pics looked gorgeous.
She is also very sweet, fun, and great to work with.
I felt totally comfortable with her.
Thanks, Steph Viva!
You made my special day just perfect!

Great work and very professional!
Would recommend to anyone.
Thanks!

Eloped in Vegas and needed a hair stylist.
Searched on craigslist and was impressed by Steph's photos.
I am pretty critical of who touches me as I am a 15 year journeyman makeup artist for the film industry but samples of her work gave me the confidence she could design the look I wanted.
Steph went over any beyond my expectations and literally gave me the wedding hair of my dreams.
Best she was on time, with a great personality and very personable.
Anyone would be lucky to have Steph Viva beatify them for a special occasion.
