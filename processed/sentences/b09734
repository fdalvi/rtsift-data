Relaxing!
I had a great pedicure.
Would def go again.

Service is great and staff is friendly.
They have customers who have been coming for years and years.
Clearly they are doing something right.
Love the services here!
Thanks Trendy Nails!

I am from California and I live there.
I expect some good work for my nails being done especially when I leave a place and the price is half of what they charge.
I do visit and frequent this area so I do sometimes run into the occasional need to go to the shops here.
Which I will now avoid since they're overly expensive and do a shitty gel manicure.
They did my toes and nails and took me for a fool.
No use of cuticle softener to clean off my feet, nor use of cuticle softener to clean off my hands.
Uh okay?
Second misshap was when I was getting my massage for my pedi and the lady doing my nails mocked me of what I said.
I looked her up and down and was kind of shocked at first someone could be that weird and do something like that.
Next thing was they kinda ditched me and hurried me off because they had some regulars who were of course snobby and stuck up, impatient when they were the ones late.
I don't like that, I don't expect you to cater to me but I don't expect you to shoo me out the way.
Don't talk to me if I'm paying you and the thing that comes out your mouth is to mock me.
It isn't necessary.
Won't be back.
Don't need to be charged 85 dollars for two services and a wax job to have lumpy gel manicures where the color isn't solid on the nail beds of my toes or hands.
