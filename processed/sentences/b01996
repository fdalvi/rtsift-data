I wish I could remember the name of the lady that cut my hair.
It was the fastest, better looking haircuts I have ever had.
She didn't try to make small talk, which I really appreciated.
She cut my hair in about 7 minutes flat!

Usually take a chance with other Supercuts..but this place was clean, modern, and most importantly I got a great haircut.
Darci totally listened to what I wanted and did it quickly and beautifully.
Went late morning Monday..No Wait..and the best $15.00 haircut.
Next time, plan on taking advantage of their color.

Great staff, Great customer service, Great hair cuts!
The experience is as wonderful as the cut.
They really took the time to understand and cut my hair the way I wanted it done.
Wow!
-Keep up the Great work team.

Terrible haircut.
She took only about 10 minutes to cut my hair and it looked uneven.
I then told her and she said that's just the way my hair was.
Now I have to go back to get it fixed.
I would never pay any amount to get my hair cut there again.
