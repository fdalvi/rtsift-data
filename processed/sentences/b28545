This is a well stocked and family run newsagents in Newington which offers plenty of magazines, food essentials and alcohol.
The booze in here is pretty well priced with eight cans of lager or cider costing only £5.
They also sell white cider which, if you're homeless or a student, may be quite tempting, coming in at only £1.50 for a litre and half.
Be warned, however, this stuff ensues the hangover from hell.
My mate bought some last year for a pre-drink and had to literally go for a lie down after just a glass because he felt so ill.   Aside from this, Choices Express is a clean shop with a nice environment, which is always a safe bet for cheap essentials and friendly service.

Choices Newsagent is a very well organised corner shop, it's clean, fresh and has a great range of products as well as a good selection of offers too.
I popped in here for a trashy TV mag to read on the train home and they had an excellent selection that it made such a mundane task actually rather exciting.
I also got myself a Capri-Sun and after being served by a very friendly staff member, I left very pleased indeed.

Choices Express leaves a little bit to be desired compared to the numerous other newsagents located around this area.
What brings it down, ironically, is the lack of choice.
The shop strikes me as being very empty.
The shelves are sparsely populated.
A group of us visited here part way through a booze up to get some snacks and most of us came out with the same thing.
However, as mentioned before, you can indeed get some cheap booze here and the staff are always pleasant.
Ideal as the kind of place where you need to grab some essentials in a hurry, but little to make it stand out from the countless other little shops that do exactly the same in this area.
