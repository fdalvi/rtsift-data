This cooking school is held at the beautiful North Central home of Chef  Barbara Fenzl  and every month she gets an extraordinary chef in and teaches you several recipes which you then get to try afterwards.
The classes are typically  from 6:30 to 9:00 p.m.The featured chef will have their cookbook there and  sign autographs afterwards.
Barbara is also an exquisite chef and has authored many Southwest Style cookbooks.
She  ison  hand to answer questions too.
The recipes are printed out for everyone.
The classes are small, intimate and fill up quickly!!
Look for the schedule to come out around the end of September !
The classes are held in the kitchen and you drink wine while you watch the demonstration then you move to the dining room to eat !
It's a fun intimate learning experience !!
class prices vary but are around $75.
It's a Blast !!!!
Eat, Learn, and Drink??
I can't think of a better evening !!

I haven't been able to attend yet - the classes are offered from October to May, but my experience with Barbara was exceptionally pleasant.
She was very sweet, and she's added me to a newsletter list that she uses to announce class dates.
I'll update the star rating after I've taken the class.
I just wanted to give my experience with Barbara personally.
