Meredith G.: Want to go to the Bead Museum?
Me: Ummm.....ok.  Later that day....  Meredith G.: I thought you knew about this place?
Me: Nope, I thought you did!
Yep, that is how I ended up at the Bead Museum in Glendale.
Still, I must say, if you have ever made beaded jewelry, this is an interesting stop.
The museum traces the history of the (wait for it....) bead as both a decoration and as a form of currency and communication.
There are beads that are thousand of years old and works from all over the world, including some amazing African "bead paintings.
" The museum also shows the evolution of beading as an art and the materials used to make beads.
While def.
off the beaten path, if you like beading or beaded arts, worth the short trip out to Glendale and the $5 admission.
Also, there is a great bead gift shop on site, which carries all sorts of exotic beads for crafts and, of course, beaded jewelry.

My mom is a bead nut.
Like, seriously, some women have a shoe problem, my mom has a bead problem.
A SERIOUS BEAD PROBLEM.
We came to the Phoenix area over Christmas 2010, and my mom needed to stop by.
The museum goes through beads as currency, whih materials came from where and the importance of the materials they were made of, how beads play a role in ornamental costumes, so on and so forth.
I'll admit to being a little bored, but I am NOT a museum person.
At all.
The gift shop is a no-no if you, like me, come with someone with a Bead Problem, especially if they are having a sale.

I love this museum....and i love the gift shop which has a gazillion beads to look at.
Don't ask me what i would do with something if i bought it but it is fun to look!
