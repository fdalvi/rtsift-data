So I have been in need of pool service for my home in the east valley for some time.
A friend of mine that works for the City of Mesa referred this company to me as it was posted on the company website.
I had initially called on Sat and left a voice mail.
I never heard back so I called and left another voice mail a day later.
Still no return call.
I waited a few more days and called and left another voice mail (3rd One).
I have also emailed through the companies website with no response.
As of now, I still haven't heard back from this company.
Very poor customer service... As a business owner myself, i know that making yourself available to clients and RETURNING phone calls and emails is HUGE, if you want to stay in business.

We hired this "company" to maintain a spa at a vacation rental (where he was already maintaining the pool) December 2012.
Spa was never maintained, became filthy.
In February 2013 we told Seven C's we'd maintain it ourselves.
In March 2013 we moved the spa to another rental.
In January 2014, we get invoices for maintaining this spa for March, April, and May of 2013.
So attentive, he didn't even notice the spa was gone.

Seven C's Pool Service takes care of my backyard pool on a weekly basis.
I have never had any issues with the services, and the owner is a nice and honest guy to work with.
The equipment is always maintained and operating smoothly, filters clean, and water crystal clear.
Price is about average for a weekly pool service, but I can always count on my pool and equipment being in top shape.
