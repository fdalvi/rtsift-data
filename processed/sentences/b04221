An exceptional venue for the traditional bride or event planner at heart.
What a fabulous staff and quaint feel.
Great dining experience and room for a dance floor.
The garden is lovely and perfect for photos.
Love this rustic establishment and what a gem for the surroundings of Phoenix!

Beautiful venue.
Quaint, casual and intimate.
The food was served buffet stye and was great.
Pork tenderloin with apple chutney, chicken, two types of salads and bread were served.
Very simple menu but it worked well.
The staff was polite and extremely courteous.
Great place for a semi-small wedding.

Great wedding.
Brittany and Brian were so cool.
I loved the laughter and the spirituality.
I thought Shenendoah did a good job with food and the setting was nice.

I am not pleased with the staff or the venue.
The manager is less than professional, the venue is overpriced, and there is a severe lack of customer service with this.
While I do appreciate the beauty of the building, and the owners are so nice, I would say, take your money elsewhere.

If you are looking for a place to have your wedding or event, look here first.
The grounds are beautiful.
The staff is extremely accommodating.
We're talking you bring your own food and they will set up and serve it for you.
Very unheard of in this day and age.
Guests leave happy and, let's face it, isn't that what weddings or special events are about?

Not the greatest experience!
As a bride one of your biggest fears is having your wedding double booked and that's what happened.
The manager doesn't write anything down an everything goes in his phone.
Every time we talked to them we were quoted a different price on stuff.
They did work with us on opening on a Sunday since they double booked and they gave us a discounted price.
After that we felt like a burden every time we talked to them.
