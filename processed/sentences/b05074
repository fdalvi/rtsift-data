Horrible Service- to the extent that I had to come on and write about a mcdonalds... Lol

Worst McDonalds in Vegas!
Bad service consistently and sloppy made food.
3 trys and still crap.
WTF!
I am sure the hobo's panhandling outside could do better.
They seriously must go out of the way to fuck things up.
I just want to know what other McDonalds this Franchisee owns so I can avoid those also.

Agree, worst McDonalds ever.
Not only did they mess up our order, they messed up the order before ours.
