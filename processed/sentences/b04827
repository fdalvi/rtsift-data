It's been 5 years since I've had my eyes checked.
I've been wearing the same (fashion-faux pas) generic glasses just as long.
Once I get that "hair up my arse" to do something...
I know I've got to do it or I simply won't be able to live with myself for the rest of the day.
Today, I decided I needed to get new glasses.
I walked in and veered left to the optometrist where I found a pleasant, smiling receptionist.
Despite the fact that she was on the phone she said hello to me and offered me to sit while she finished her call and could answer questions.
About 3 monutes later she hung up and promptly appologized for taking so long.
I know 3 minutes isn't much but I really appreciate when people recognize that my time matters... 10 minutes or 30 seconds.
My first question... "How much is it for a glasses only eye exam?".
I know this is obsolete to a lot of people... but I don't like having to pay out the arse for something un-necessarily, so her response thrilled me.
$69 for a glasses only eye exam which is great in comparison to Lensecrafters $94!
I browsed the selection of glasses they had while I was waiting to be called back and while I wasn't totally thrilled with any of their styles (because my heart was already set on a sleek pair of Wayfarers made by Ray-Ban) they had a wide selection to suit just about everyone.
I waited only 15 minutes before the receptionist (please forgive me for forgetting her name, I should remember because she was simply pleasant) called me back for the air test.
I was placed in a room and told Dr. Garcia would be with me shortly.
Once again, the service was speedy.
I must have only been in that room for 5 minutes...
The exam was thorough but quick and Dr. Garcia was fabulously nice!
I walked out in under an hour (just as advertised) with perscription in hand!
I would recommend this place to anyone, reguardless of whether or not you actually get your glasses here.
