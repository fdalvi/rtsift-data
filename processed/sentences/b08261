I don't come here that often, but it's pretty good.
And when I ask for gummy bears they put TONS in there!
They never skimp.

Pretty good.
Icecream is of course good but every now and then it's freezer burned.
Yuck!

Sweet, for an ice cream treat, nothing special but my daughter loves the ice cream and the service, she got free sprinkles.
LOL... a ok with me!
