After shopping at this store for over 8 years, I have overlooked many things like dirty bathrooms and non-functioning glass sliding doors...But I had always thought of it as the local grocery store of choice (there are two other options equidistant from my home in Carefree, AZ...).
UNTIL TODAY - I was berated and embarrassed by a cashier who yelled at me that I was breaking the law by having a dog in the store and who refused to load the cart because the 8 pound shih tzu was apparently too ferocious.
Needless to say, I left my groceries and have NO intentions of returning.
I am all for a gentle reminder of food and safety rules, but I think the cashier was OVER THE TOP...  Safeway and Basha's here I come...

I took a quick stop here for a few groceries.
I stopped at the Starbucks at the front of the store for an iced coffee then I got my groceries from the produce aisle.
Not a lot of organic produce unfortunately.
The selection was good other than that.
My checker was extremely friendly and nice.
I thought this was a nice store.

Prices for food and everything else are a bit too pricey compared to Safeway and Frys's prices.
Employees can be rude.
Bathrooms aren't ever clean.
