Ok I can only say this: WTF?
No wonder this chain is having financial problems.
I went in to find items that were in the Sunday sales circular and this location had NONE of them.
Again WTF?
Nor did they have any staff that cared about helping anyone find anything.
I was in that store looking for things for about 30 minutes and the only person who spoke to me was the panhandler outside the store.
The paid staff was too busy somewhere else 'cause they sure weren't visible in the store.

Terrible pharmacy!
Can't say how many times they have messed up my prescriptions.
And even when it's been their fault their answer is "once it leaves the pharmacy nothing can be done" if they just had an ounce of customer service instead of just being flat out rude I wouldn't mind so much.
From here on out ill drive the extra 15min to another just so I don't have to deal with them again.

This store has such a bad rap, but I go there at least twice a week and love it!
Everyone is super nice, especially the cosmetics lady!
I deal with the pharmacy staff and they will always let me know if I should wait or come back because of the volume and that is awesome.
This place can get super busy so if you're in a hurry, quit your bitchin' and drive on.
I appreciate this place, and will remain a loyal customer.
