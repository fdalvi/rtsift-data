Like this location, fairly close to my house and open late.
Whenever I'm in the mood for some fresh dogs, I jet over here.
Highly  recommend their  ALL BEEF mustard and chili dogs.
Check out the fries too, super salty, always fresh and leave you wanting more!
Not a big fan of their pretzel or corn dogs- expect a little bit of wait, perfect hot dogs don't take minutes to make!

Blech.
How can you mess up a turkey dog?
I could've nuked mine at home and it would've tasted better than this.
I won't be back.
Also, I ordered a meal in the drive through and they forgot the fries.

Hotdogs were no better, in fact worse, than would come out of my microwave.
What a total and complete waste of my time going all the way out here.
Bought a groupon, as I love hotdogs.
Won't be making another trip here, that's for sure.

Been here multiple times.
Food and service are consistent and friendly.
Excellent.

Good hot dogs if you absolutely have no other clue as to what you wanna eat for dinner.
The hotdogs are tiny so you'll need to buy 3 to get full.
The fries are ok, and they put mustard in every hotdog unless you tell them no.
My husband likes this place, I tolerate it.
Wouldn't come here on my own.
Lol

I dropped by the drive-thru on South Higley, remembering a blast from the past during my Navy days and eating some Der Wienerschnitzel on Rosecrans Blvd.
by NTC, thinking I was going to be in for a treat.
I thought wrong!
It was over-priced, and that sandwich was just really small.
The food just wasn't all that good.
The service was fine and timely, it wasn't until I arrived at my destination that I learned that once again I had been boofed in the drive-thru.
No hurry going back!
Perhaps if I really start jonesing for some chili dogs I might come back, but I'd really have to be craving them.
