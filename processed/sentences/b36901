Its just ok.
They didn't return any of my phone calls.
The people that work there are definitely not friendly.
very small space.
The teachers are very good.

Innerlight is awesome!
Great staff, students, teachers, and parents.
Feels like a second family.

Innerlight teachers are amazing...the whole studio is like one big family!
Very clean facility, especially the bathrooms

Innerlight dance is incredible..
I bought dance lessons from groupon and wouldn't think about taking my daughter anywhere else.. Ms. Caroline is so patient and kind to all her lil lights!!
If your looking for dance classes innerlight dance is the place to go.
