Iv come to this location for a year only because its close to my house and its horrible.
Even with early morning appointments I still average at least a 1 hour wait time.
No idea why it takes them this long for a shot that takes 2 minutes.

Going through bookmarks and saw I had yet to review this.
This place is just bad.
I had to go here multiple times for my birth control as well as an annual appointment and the entire office seems to be in apathetic disarray - no one is organized, no one is communicative and no one cares.
On multiple occassions I had to wait an hour for a REFILL in a waiting room that wasn't even half full.
No reason, no apology.
These people claim they are here to help.
Do not believe it.
They do not care about you.
They just want you to pay and leave.
I told a lady behind the counter that I was trying to get birth control for a vacation so I wouldn't miss any days and it just seemed like the biggest inconvenience ever.
Sorry that I am trying to look out for myself.
My birth control comes in the mail now finally - I was told for almost a year that it would be "next month" when I came in once a month or once every other month.
I dread the day I have to step foot in here again.
