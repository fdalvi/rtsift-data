This place is great for fish and chips.
They have beer battered halibut in addition to the standard cod.
This is what I usually order since I enjoy it so much, especially since it is almost impossible to find anyone who uses halibut for fish & chips.
The other items on the menu are decent enough, we have never had a bad meal here.
I wanted to give it a higher rating but they recently changed the menu up a bit, instead of raising their prices, they made the portions smaller for the same price.
This bugs me.
You used to get 3 large pieces of fish for $12.99, now you get 2 medium sized pieces.
Service is ok, have had better but have had worse.

This place is great!
I've never had a bad meal here.
The clam chowder is some of the best that I've ever had.
Tonight I had the crab legs.
My husband had lemon dill crusted orange roughy.
It was one of the best fish dishes that I have ever tried.

This used to be the best, a little pricey, but delicious when they were located by Fiesta Mall.
But, now it's just overpriced small portions which are still very good tasting.
You pretty much need to order 2 fish and chip dinners to get 1 good meal which makes the price absolutely ridiculous.
Another great classic food joint that moved into an expensive lease and now can't remember what made them successful.
Too bad.
