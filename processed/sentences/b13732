Great place!
Very friendly staff.
And they make the subs look like what you see on tv, not all thrown together.
Very clean establishment also.

Staff is friendly.
Food is of course Subway.
The only thing is its always busy.
Expect to stand in line for a good long time.
People just can't seem to make up their minds while they stare at all the veggies.
Lol

Ew, just ew.
Worst Subway I've ever been too, nothing but fat people and this place was so dirty and the food was gross and stale, avoid at all costs.
