I recently tried going to Prime Dental in Laveen because they are close to my home.
I have also previously gone to Laveen Dental and Southwest Dental in Laveen.
I was not impressed with any of them.
At Prime Dental I had Dr.
Flowers.
He was friendly during my exam, but when I came back for fillings, he was all business.
Went right to work giving me shots without a greeting.
The procedure took a VERY long time.
He never checked in with me to see if I was alright.
My head was practically on the floor with my feet in the air.
Water was sprayed all over my face and dripping off.
I was highly uncomfortable and in a lot of pain.
Left with heavily bleeding, swollen gums.
I went home and took my strongest pain reliever....I've never had to do that before and I've had a lot of work done in my mouth.
I will not be returning.
Even if you live in Laveen, I recommend traveling to a dentist that will make sure you are as comfortable as possible.

No No No, incomplete work and liers when it came to the whitening kit.
Money hungry.
I went in early and they were the one running behind so why rush me because the next appointment is here.
Find another spot to get your work done

At first I loved them.
I got a $50 groupon for X-rays, a cleaning, and a comprehensive exam.
A month later I get a bill in the mail for $574.
So, I'm young, no insurance, and not that much money.
This keeps me up at night.
The next day, I leave a voicemail, upset, as anyone might understand.
This is my credit we're talking about, I didn't get any sleep, not to mention that I just can't afford to pay that.
Shannon calls me back admonishing me for getting upset, saying it was a simple mistake an adjustment wasn't made.
She then continues to scold me, and now I'm getting more upset to the point of tears.
This was your mistake.
I have a right to be upset.
I talked to four people in that office when I went in to make sure that I wasn't going to be billed for anything extra.
Hello Prime Dental, when your "mistake" has the potential to affect my livelihood, and I'm a struggling twenty something.
I'm going to get upset.
Will I ever go back now that I'm getting insurance?
No.
Condescending and paternalistic doesn't win patients.
Shannon was unspeakably rude, and when she made me so angry that I was about to cry, she hung up on me.
I had to call back again to make sure that the mistake was corrected, and I wouldn't be receiving another bill a month from now.
You had me at that groupon.
You lost me and everyone I will talk to about this b/c Shannon talks down to the patients you scare the hell out of.

Me and gf goes here.
Not a single bad thing about this dental spot.
They have nice and friendly staff.
I would never go for another dentist .
I had 2 root canal.
3 cleanings.
2 pulling out and iam pretty sure i havent felt so secure walking in a dentist.

This place was/is a MUCH better experience than what I had with Southwest Dental Laveen.
Immediately I was greeted (both on the phone and in person) in a friendly, positive demeanor (unlike SW Dental...) and felt comfort.
I have dentist anxiety and cant help but be nervous every time no matter where.
During my 1st visit with Prime, I kept myself pretty calm more-so than I have elsewhere.
They made it easier on me with their friendly & positive demeanor's.
They were willing to address any issue I may have and wanted to be sure I was doing OK (taking my nervousness/anxiety into consideration!).
Sure, I still loath going to the dentist but I feel that these guys are better experienced than other offices,and know what customer satisfaction & care is all about.
I have read the previous reviews and I believe they need better credit considering a majority are 2+ years old.
