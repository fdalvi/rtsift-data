I've got a big fluffy grey cat (yes, I know I'm "that guy" with a cat, but I'm over it), and during the summers he gets hot and hence sheds all over the place.
The solution: shave him down.
I wanted to find a place that groomed cats (not just dogs), wasn't a PetSmart-type place, and was not some sort of random dude in a van that also groomed animals.
I found this place by where I live, and it was a very wonderful place.
What I first liked about the place was the fact that is was also attached to a veterinarian's office, giving me a sense of confidence in the place.
What I also noticed is that the staff remembered the dogs that were coming in to get groomed and struck up conversations with the owners, which meant that other folks liked this place enough to keep bringing their animals back.
Plus the place was immaculately clean and did not smell like dog.
All good signs.
They told me to come back in a couple of hours and took the cat to a separate area from all the dogs so that he would not get scared.
They called me when he was done to come pick him up, and reminded me not to laugh at him when I came and got him.
The grooming looked great (and all the dogs I noticed getting cut too looked good), they took great care of the cat, and the entire staff seemed to really enjoy what they were doing and show genuine care for the animals.
I was very impressed and will take the cat here every summer for his "summer hair-do.

Horrible!
Read my tip and that was being nice!
Whatever you do, don't leave your dog here!
Dana is abusive and my husband and I caught her!
