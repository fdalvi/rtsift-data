Ya'll know what McDonald's is, yar bugger.
If you've absolutely got to have your mayo and fried food fix, this McD's will suffice.
It's average.
It's not a stay-away-at-all-costs McD's, and it's not the superstar McD's that I'm sure exists somewhere.
It's new-ish and still in good shape.
Nice people.
No kiddie play area.
Comical dual drive-through, one of whose lanes is blocked off half the time, probably to prevent the drive-through rage that ensues when the person in the next lane cuts you off when it was "your turn".

People are nice but this is the slowest mcdonalds ever

I hate to waste time reviewing mcdonalds but this one does have the best frapp√©s of any I've been to.
Also the new Mc D's style inside is nicer than the ugly throw up decor they used to have.
That's all...

Went here today about 4:30 pm.
Asked for fries with no salt.
Never had a problem any where else but, apparently here it's an issue.
I received  plenty of attitude from my cashier when asking for salt packets and ketchup.
After being asked to pull up to Mcdonalds waiting lot.
I told my gpa, watch she's gonna be a snot and not put the salt packets in.After 5 minutes our fries come out.. With of course intentionally no salt.
My reasoning for the no salt my Gpa eat it..
But I can.
So he eats his with no salt and I have mine with it.
A little FYI for the Mcdonalds drive thu cashier, it's your job honey it's honestly not that complicated.
