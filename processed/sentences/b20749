I think it's safe to say that the growth of the Fair Trade movement has been one of the most striking retail phenomenons of the past ten years - shoppers suddenly taking an interest in where the products they buy come from, and demanding ethical guarantees about how workers are treated.
The brand has become sufficiently mainstream now that every major supermarket seems to have developed its own brand of Fair Trade chocolate or coffee, with even multinational corporations like Nestl√© jumping on the bandwagon.
It's easy to forget that it all started with pioneering independent stores such as the One World Shop at St John's, which is staffed by volunteers, and was one of the first dedicated Fair Trade shops to open, before the phrase had become a household name.
Today, it's still going strong and is a testament to how diverse the Fair Trade movement has become - you can buy almost anything here: as well as a good selection of coffee, chocolate and dried fruit, they sell handmade clothes, pots and pans, exquisite jewellery, books about ethical consumerism and even a range of shopping bags made from recycled juice cartons.
It's my favourite place in Edinburgh to buy gifts, not just because it's all Fair Trade, but also just because it's a shop filled with beautiful things around the world, proof that making ethical choices doesn't have to involve compromising on quality.

While Fairtrade is in theory a good idea, I can't seem to shake the feeling that the main purpose of shops like this is not in fact to improve economic practices in developing countries, but to give Guardian readers something to brag about at dinner parties.
Whereas a charity shop can seem sweet, genuine and homely, One World Shop is very much a lifestyle accessory store for those who hide their ravenous obsession with wealth and status behind a veil of Indian pan-pipe music and hummus.
In all fairness the toys do look really cute and well-made, though everything else seems to me a bit soulless.
It's not really my kind of place at all but if you're into the whole right-on thing you'll probably lap it up, and be able to find a nice wooden ornament to beat your Indonesian housekeeper with later on.
