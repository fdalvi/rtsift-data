Great service...great communication!

When I developed pool issues in the dead of summer I only could presume the worst in both time and cost to get it repaired.
What a pleasant surprise when I talked to Bill from Moores and despite already having been in my area earlier in the day, he came back my way and even when the fix wasn't as quick as we both had hoped, he stuck with the job and completed it the same day.
Then came the invoice and I was very pleasantly surprised at the fairness of the charges.
Another thing, we talked at length about the general age and condition of my equiptment and while never once trying to sell me anything, he educated me as to my options in the future as the inevitable begins to occur with aging equiptment.
Great guy, great service and while I hope to not need his services again in the near future, when I need repairs to the pool equiptment beyond my capabilities, Moore's will get my business.

Bill Moore is the best!
He is skilled, professional, courteous, and efficient.
The first three times I called Bill for assistance (over 6 years) he was able to troubleshoot my issue over the phone, advise me to do the simple fixes on my own, and never charged me a dime.
He just asked that I call him for serious issues, too.
Last year I actually got to pay him for a repair on a rental home, and he showed up, fixed the issue in a single trip, and called me to arrange payment a day later.
So convenient!
And last week he replaced my home pool filter while I was away at work....it was like having magic little elves take care of everything for me!
He just asked that I drop a check in the mail a few days later.
Bill is fantastic - I refer him to everyone who's seeking repairs or ongoing service.
Call him!

Bill, the owner, did a great job for us and saved us money.
I would highly recommend him, very knowlegable and responsive, which is tough to find these days.
Good job, thanks!
