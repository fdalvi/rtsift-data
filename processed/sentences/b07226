Stopped in while engagement ring shopping with my fiancee's sister.
Was greeted buy a guy with lots of unsightly tattoos and big hoops in his ear, not exactly the type of person to sell jewelry but I kept an open mind.
We asked to see a couple rings and their price, he slid a catalog toward us and said "they're all in there".
He then walked away and talked on his cell phone behind the counter toward the back.
He ignored us from there.
I was ready to drop thousands on a ring but couldn't get the time of day.
On the way out, a lady asked if we had been helped.
It's a small shop, so the service was so bad they didn't even realize someone had helped us.
I said "sort of" and just walked out.
The staff should be ashamed of their behavior.

Rude staff.
Upon arrival I noticed three employees with unhappy looks on their faces and immediately thought to myself this is not going to be a pleasant experience.
To my surprise I was greeted by one of the staff while the others ignored me.
You have to imagine this is a small store and everyone is with in talking distance to each other.
I told the staff that greeted me that I was here for my 6months checkup of the two purchases I made within the year.
I was then asked if I had brought my paperwork with me.
I replied that I did not bring any paperwork with me and asked if my information could be found with a name search.
The staff member seemed irritated and said she could run a search but data isn't always found.
She continues to ask me when I made the purchase I replied within the past 6months.
Then a 2nd employee interrupts and pretty much scolded me and said "you should always bring paperwork with you.
" I replied that I was told paperwork wasn't necessary when I first made the purchase.
Then the 3rd employee says in a snarky tone, "I believe it says in the paperwork to bring the paperwork.
I reply again that I was told paperwork wasn't necessary upon purchase.
Overall I felt like I was being attacked by the employees of Kay jewelers.
As most people would say if you are unhappy with your job then find another one.
Those employees give Kay jewelers a bad rep and I would think twice about returning for future purchases.

This place is a joke.
Crappy service, crappy staff, crappy inventory.
Don't bother.
Rude, rude, rude.

I recently had the pleasure of visiting this Kay store recently, and I had a great experience.
They had a low pressure environment and I found what I wanted with the help of the staff, not the item with the largest price tag.
Plan on returning in the future to get another watch.
Thanks guys..
