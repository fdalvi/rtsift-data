I love this little trail!
It is a hard steep hike that is 2.2 miles round trip.
Around the level of difficulty of camelback but easier for big dogs.
Went this Sunday morning and only ran into about 10 people.
Very nice.
It might be a little difficult to find parking.
Follow School house  road up to hit the trail!

This trail is one very good reason to visit the Cave Creek area.
It provides some of the best views of the Valley without being too far from Phoenix, it gives you a really good cardiovascular workout because the climb is moderately challenging, and you have truly breathtaking views from the slope to the summit.
I did not encounter any really risky drop-offs from the sides of the trail, but the abundance of cacti and sharp-angled rocks will make you want to be careful nonetheless.
The trailhead and parking area are right in the middle of the town of Cave Creek, which makes it easy find a cafe, restaurant, or bar to refresh yourself after completing the climb.

Today was extremely buggy on the trail.
I felt like a rotting corpse!
Trail is steady climb entire way up.
Will have to try it again another day.
