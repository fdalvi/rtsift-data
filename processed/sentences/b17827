Nice, clean, neighborhood market.
It's a bit on the expensive side for every day shopping, but a pretty decent place to pick up a few items, or wine/beer/booze.
Once in a while you get some decent specials on meat, fruit & produce.
Very friendly staff, place has a good vibe to it.
Skip the brick oven pizzas, nothing to write home about.

I like this Basha's.... its local, and convenient.
I don't think they are the cheapest place in town to shop... but it's around the corner from where I live.
I also like supporting local Arizona business.
The staff at this Basha's is always very friendly, and I like to frequent one store so you get to know the staff.
They often run a $10 dinner "combo" package that is a really fair deal if you don't feel like cooking.
You get to pick from different items and piece together a meal for $10.
Not bad to feed a family of 4.

Really liked this Supermarket while visiting the area.
Great private label selection and really tasty potato salad!
Kind of a Whole Food feel!

I don't shop here often but the young man that rang my order was super friendly.
So nice that when I got home and realized I was overcharged for my beer, that it wasn't too much of a bother.
