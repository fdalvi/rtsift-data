Excellent, friendly service for a great price.
I brought my shoes in and 2 days later they looked BRAND NEW.
I would highly recommend this place.
They're just 1/2 block south of Main St. by the Nile.

I love this place!
Fabian is so reasonable , quick and reliable.
I bring all my shoes luggage, briefcase and boots and belts to him for repair.
I highly recommend them!

Fabian was so helpful for an emergency boot repair.
