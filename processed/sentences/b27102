I love Ross.... a lot.
I always check them out for deals, I can never resist.
I'm usually deterred by the insanely long and unregulated lines.
This place was clean and organized.
This is probably because it's a lower traffic store, but unlike most smaller stores they still had a lot of variety which is pretty unusual  Definitely a must shop.
I have been here on two occasions, despite living on the complete other side of town.

I love getting my dress pants and shirts from Ross.
They always have enough selection in my size with good quality brand clothes.
I don't come here for anything else though so really my review score is only based off clothes and customer service which I feel are both great.

Womp womp.
Besides not being able to find anything...Ross to me is just kind of run down.
Security greets you as soon as you walk through the door, and watch you grab a cart.
Or in this case, grab a cart, put my diaper bag in, strap in my baby in the seat.......Was I not doing it quick enough?
No one looks happy working there...
In fact, security was the only person who even spoke to me.
The only thing in here that I saw worth buying was Burts Bees scrub, that they had priced for $5, instead of other stores usually having it priced at $13/$14.
Don't plan on buying a lot here, because you can't take the carts out of the store....
They have that large, tall pole attached to them.
I totally forgot about it, and tried to exit.
The cart got stuck, and I tried to remove my daughter, and my belongings out of the basket, so I could put it back in the store....... No employee help... Kind of crappy.
