Total body workouts.
Everyday is a different circuit training.
Damon always motivating.
No words can explain what a beast of a workout this place gives you

I've been working with Charles for a month now and I've definitely noticed changes in my body.
He takes the time to pay attention to the little things, like doing simple exercises that help strengthen my lower back.
I never leave a session without breaking a sweat!
The gym has a very welcoming feel.
All the trainers are friendly and greet me when I come in.
Definitely not intimidating the way other gyms can be.
I recommend this gym, and Charles to anyone who has had injuries that have prevented them from working out, or if you've been out of the game for a while.
Charles will set up a routine that works for you, and best suits your needs.

My friend and I decided to take private boxing lessons from Damon.
We had no experience and it is amazing how much we have learned in a month.
We Love IT!
The workout is always challenging but I feel such accomplishment getting through it.
I love the fact that it is always different and not boring.
I like how he explains the "WHY" in the things he teaches.
I feel much stronger than before and I am looking forward to working more on my technique and endurance.
Thanks Damon, we will see you tonight!
