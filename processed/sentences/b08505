Less than one mile from my house.
I like papa john's thin pizza.
It's crispy and fresh.

While I don't generally order out for pizza, when I do, I'm usually very satisfied with Papa John's.
Their online ordering is great, and always winds up with a correct order.
They deliver within 30-40 minutes, and since they are close to my house, the pizza is always hot.

They take orders accurately and deliver in a timely fashion.

This is a great location as far as Papa John's go.
Orders are always perfect and pizza isn't undercooked like some locations.
Friendly staff too
