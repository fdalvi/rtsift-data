Excellent video game store.
The staff here is always knowledgeable and helpful.
I prefer shopping here as opposed to other retail options in the area just for the knowledge of the staff here.
I have yet to stump them on any questions.
Their game recommendations have been solid and they've helped me save money through deals they run, promotions and product education.
If you need more than just to buy a game, this is the place to go.
Their knowledge of the games and peripherals is excellent and worth tapping into for your benefit.

This Gamestop store is basically like any other Gamestop store-- overpriced used games and consoles, horrible buyback rates, aggressive sales technique, and pretentious employees.
Sometimes, when you tell them that you're not interested in becoming a "member" or whatever their program is, they just keep talking over you.
Do your game shopping elsewhere.
eStarland has great prices on used games and consoles and great buyback rates.

Always helpful.
Of course they are salesmen, thats what they are hired for, trained for and do to pay the bills.
Jake ,jacob, is awesome!

Sure its more expensive than purchasing online, but you get it with the service.
I had an issue with a game that would have left me holding the bag if I had ordered online.
Sky and Dan were there to help me get an exchange and even hook me up with some DLC when GS didn't even make the mistake.
If you have had a bad experience with GS in the past, come talk to these guys; they will change your mind.
