It really is as good as it gets... the teachers, the curriculum and eveything else puts Desert Heights as one of the best K-8th school...my kid is been going to DH since 1st grade, she is now in 5th and they way they care of their kids is amazing...

This school is awesome!!!
What a refreshing changes from the crap school my kids used to go to.
Thank God I found this place.
the curriculum here is awesome, the lunch options are amazing, the staff and other parents are great, I love this place!

The high school portion is VERY different and ran differently than the grade school.
I ended up pulling my kids out of there.
High teacher turn-over, the inability of the school to cope with any special needs.
bad.
Years ago the administration was good; but not its just.. bad (in my openion).
