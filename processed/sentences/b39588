A boat trip down the Firth of Forth is a great way to spend a Saturday morning and to see the city of Edinburgh and Kingdom of Fife from a perspective you've never seen before.
The Forth Boat Tours trip, aboard the Forth Belle, leaves from Hawes Pier and takes you first towards the west, past the Forth Road Bridge, before turning around and heading towards the mouth of the Estuary and stopping at the stunning Inchcolm Island.
You can choose to get off at Inchcolm (at a cost of £5 per adult  which goes to Historic Scotland for access to the island) or to stay on board and return to Hawes Pier.
If you choose to get off at Inchcolm Island, you have 90 minutes (not quite enough to thoroughly explore the Augustinian Abbey and world War II embattlements).
Take a picnic if you do get off, as the only shop on the island does not sell drinks or food.
Your boat trip is guided with an informative, interesting, and at times witty pre-recorded commentary.
On our return from Inchcolm Island, the captain stopped the boat to give the passengers a chance to look out for seals that normall hang out on a cluster of rocks.
The boat, an 83 ft saloon with outdoor seating at bow (uncovered) and stern (covered), and a fully enclosed, warm, saloon viewing area has toilets, and a bar/cafe.
This experience is perfect for tourists and locals alike!
For those looking for soemthing a little different, there are salsa dancing, jazz and disco night cruises available too!
£11.00 per adult  but look out on Groupon/living social as we got a very good, discounted deal!
