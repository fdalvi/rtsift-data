I have had my hair highlighted and cut by Meghan for the past 6 years.
I love how she does my hair.
Sometimes I want something specific and she listens to me and does exactly what we discussed.
Other times I leave it up to her and she always has great ideas.
Meghan is willing to be flexible with her appointments so that I can have my hair done when it fits my busy schedule.
