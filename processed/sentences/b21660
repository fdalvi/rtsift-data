I cannot believe there is only 1 other review of this place.
Chicken & Waffles people come on.
I was looking for something different last Sunday morning and I remembered seeing this place on MLK.
I would agree with the other reviewer about the parking, small awkward and hard to get in & out.
It's a small diner with a booth along the entire front wall and several tables.
A sign reading "seat yourself" greets you the moment you walk in.
The place is small but cozy with a TV in the center so every seat in the house can see it,  There is was only 2 servers and a large table there when I arrived so it took a few minutes to get drinks&menus.
The menus said stright up "Just Chicken & Waffles"-and thats exactly what it was 2pc-3pc-dark,white,wheat,buttermilk,wha do you want.
In small print across the bottom it read "Friday-Sunday BBQ Ribs $10" I asked and she said"nope,chicken & waffles"  Well I got 2 breast,2 waffles and my son got the special 3 wings & a waffle.
The food came out real fast with hot syrup on the side and we doused our chicken in some hot sauce & tore it up.
Why have I never had this before, I bet I never even took a breath.
Some of the best chicken I have had.
Not all deep fried & greasy or steroided out just sweet crispy & very savory.And the waffles were good too.
what a mix.
This is a true dive spot DIAMOND!

Parking is terrible and service is slow as stated before but the food is definitely worth the wait.
The waffles take up the majority of your plate and they are warm, soft, and have a great cinnamon taste to them.
And the chicken....WOW.
Light crisp breading on the chicken that's not too greasy.

the service was fast, The guy seem was a little upset (don't know why) he just was not friendly.
I had the chicken n waffles.......Waffles were great the chicken tasted like it was old and fries too hard.
My friend had the fried catfish mmmmm gooood......
I ate half of her's.
Everything else was good.
I would go again, but wont get the chicken
