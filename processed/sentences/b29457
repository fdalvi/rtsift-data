Great staff....very knowledgeable and approachable.
PLUS I got results....I was never a big believer in PT, but I am now!
Next I have to try the training sessions!

After several hand surgeries I picked Foothills Sports Medicine as my therapy provider.
Now that I have been going there for about five months 3-5 days a week, I feel I am more than qualified to say.
YOU WILL NOT FIND A BETTER GROUP OF PEOPLE TO HELP YOU!
They have a true desire to provide you with a progressive, open minded plan to rehab yourself.
I would Highly recommended them for anything from a serious injury to my finger hurts a little........

2 years ago fell while sledding, the pain so great I was sure I had torn my rotater cuff in my shoulder.
Thankfully, I didn't, but required rehab.
The staff is excellent in what they do and add a warm and friendly touch to the visit.
Even after rehab, I still go back every now and then for some dry needling in my shoulders.
Rehab isn't fun, but these people take care of you with a smile.
I wouldn't choose any other place to go for any rehab I may need in the future.
