I'm not the biggest fan of BOFA because of their fees, but I get a discount because of affiliations.
I find this branch to be a bit slow at times as far as lines or waiting for someone to help you in their office.
Other than that, it's meh... all right.

I dont bank with this bank, but when I go in to cash checks .. always friendly but I feel like they are always trying to get me to switch to their bank and I really DO NOT like the fact that they charge $6 to cash checks.

Worst Bank of America branch ever !!!
I went in there to get some answers to some questions I had .
The supposedly manger made me feel so discriminate .
He didn't let me even finish asking him my ?
Just told me to wait , he didn't sign me in or even ask for my name nothing .
Waited there like 15 min no one came to help at all .
The bank wasn't even full it's was in the morning when it's usually empty .
I don't know he just judge me for being a young Latina women .
But the point is they made fell bad and I'm never going step a foot in that bank ever!!!!!!

This bank is the friendliest in Vegas!!!
Everyone calls me by name when I walk in the door and they always have smiling faces!!!
Very clean and professional!!
Also with the ability to set an appointment online before I come in, my customer service needs are taken care of quickly and with excellence!
In and out!
And now that the ATM can do cash and checks I have no need to fill out silly deposit slips or wait in a line if there is one.
Quick and friendly this location is top notch!
