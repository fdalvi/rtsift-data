Great selection of luggage and travel accessories.
Salespeople  good product knowledge and very helpful.

Finally Chandler has a full service luggage store with tons of options I was tired of buying at Macy's and other department stores with dumb sales people that know nothing about luggage

Very nice luggage store with knowledgeable salespeople.
If you are looking for higher end luggage that is actually very sturdy and reliable, this is the place for you.
The luggage that I was looking at came with a two year warranty that you can replace with normal wear and tear.
Salesman greeted us very promptly and answered all of our questions and made the experience enjoyable rather than dealing with grumpy salespeople.

This travel store is the perfect place to find a Christmas, birthday, misc gift for your hard-to-buy-for friends.
It also has a great selection of luggage.
They also let me find a quiet corner to nurse my baby in... which was much better than returning to a bench in the busy, public mall walkway.
5 stars!
I think the best thing was the nice (pretty) woman that worked there.
She made me want to buy lil travel trinkets.. and I did!
haha  See ya there!

A great place for luggage.
Nice selection of accessories.
I agree sales staff are very friendly and knowledgeable.
They love to talk travel.
The owner has a line of his own luggage.
There are higher end pieces than what they carry, but love the Rick Steves and also Tumi.
Collection they have.
