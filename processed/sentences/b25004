Bob built a gorgeous wrought iron pool gate for child proofing our pool for our children.
He advised us on the right location of the fence with his vast experience and insight on keeping the pool and pool area child free.
The fence is clean, painted precisely and done by a real professional.
His price was GREAT and very reasonable.
We added a self closing gate with a Magna Latch for additional safety for our 9 month old and 3 year old.
I would highly recommend Bob and his team of professionals on their quality and efficient work!

Bob installed a pool fence in our yard last summer.
I forgot to review it at the time, but we were very pleased with the service and the price.
He cares about the kids he is protecting.
