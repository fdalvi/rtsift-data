I recently had my make-up done by Jena for an Ahwatukee Chamber of Commerce event.
She volunteered her time to make up models for a fashion show.
She did amazing work on all the models.
.we were a group of "normal" women of all ages and she made everyone look radiantly gorgeous!
Definitely knows what she is doing!
Highly recommend!

SkinFIT is a big part of my healthy aging program.
Jena's skin care treatments are custom made for my skin type and she keeps my skin looking radiant and healthy.
She is extremely knowledgeable and knows what treatments to use and what products would be best for me.
I highly recommend Jena, she is awesome!

Jena's skin care treatments have been great.
From my own visit and sending my gf there several times, we have nothing but great things to say.
She is very knowledgeable and polite, a great experience all around.

I see Jena every 6 weeks for my brows and dermaplaning and my skin has never looked better!
I get complimented on my brows all the time, she takes her time and shapes them to perfection.
She is very knowledgeable with products and will recommend the perfect serums and moisturizers for your skin.
