Fantastic staff, they care about helping you get better.
A well-rounded physical therapy clinic, they incorporate science-based myofascial release techniques with individually tailored rehab programs to get you where you want to be.
I especially like the hands-on approach (literally!
) they take with each patient.
You aren't a number here, and the therapists will work with you and adapt their treatment depending on your progress and needs the day they see you - not blindly holding to a plan developed at the start of your treatment.
As a sports enthusiast, I was also pleased to learn that they play competitive sports themselves, and have experience with sports-related rehab.
Both my knee and back concerns have been addressed, and while I don't hope pain or injury on anyone, if you have it, you should try them out - they'll take care of you.

I have been a patient with Athletica for the last 2 weeks.
I was coming off an ankle operation (kidner procedure) and had only been out of my cam walker for 3 days when I first saw the team.
3 weeks prior to that, I had been non weight bearing for a month.
Sandy quickly assessed my strength and flexibility and created a workout and home exercise program to help me quickly rebuild.
I have seen dramatic improvement in range of motion and strength since my first appointment and am now able to walk smoothly, with only a slight limp.
I have seen my muscle tone greatly improve and the myofacial treatment is dramatically improving the texture of my scar tissue.
I would recommend Athletica to anyone seeking to recover from an injury quickly yet safely.
The team are all athletes and they understand how to prepare you to return to an active lifestyle.
