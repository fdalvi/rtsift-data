This place is awesome!
Larry was my tattoo artist and he was so friendly!
His work was great and he was fast!
My sparrow looks awesome!

This is my first tattoo and it was a good experience .
Ray was nice and showed good customer service skills with 30 years experience .
I will be going back for another one.
The parking for this place is safe and conveniently in the front not in a back ally.
This place wasn't to far from the strip either.
Good price, not to  expensive .

It took me a long time to find Ray.
I wish I would have 12 years earlier because I will never step foot into another tattoo shop EVER!

Ray was the first tattoo artist i found, and he will be my last!
I have 3 by him, and ill get the rest of mine by him.
He was patient with me for my first 2 that i got at the same time, and stopped when I needed it.
Makes you feel comfortable and you get to pick the music while getting your work done.
He doesn't mind you bringing people along to watch I'm in action.
I think the prices are awesome, and fair.
Love it here!
