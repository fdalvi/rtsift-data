We are snowbirds from Canada who went looking for doggie daycare in Fountain Hills so we could go golfing.
We are thrilled we found Zusia's.
Sue and Dana are a wonderful hard working couple who truly love the pets they care for.
Their hours are great as is the  food selection and accessories.
Our 13 and a half year old lab, Zoe, was well taken care of in a no pen environment with a large play area in the back.
All the dogs looked happy and played together.
We also had Zoe groomed one day and she looked years younger.
Nice job!
We highly recommend Zusia's and will be returning next year.

I have taken my dog to two other locations in Fountain Hills and was disappointed with the service and grooming.
I have been coming to Suzanne for over two years will not be going any where else.
My dog looks great after she grooms him.
He loves the daycare too.
The best place in town for your dog in my opinion and I am very perticular They are very caring about the dogs well being.
He comes home happy and tired!They also carry a large variety of quality food and great prices.
I highly recommend Zusia's !

This is our go to spot to get our little munchkins hair did!!
They do a great job and take great care of your pup.
If you are are a working person you are able to drop the pup off at 8 and pick her up when you are done with your workday.
They are great people who are dedicated to delivering exceptional service.
They will always put a fitting bow on your pup's collar to match what time of the year it is.
Trust this place with grooming and you won't be disappointed.
Family owned and operated.
