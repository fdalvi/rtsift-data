UNPROFESSIONAL/RUDE.
Their staff was not friendly at all.
Very hard to get through on the phones and when you do staff is very rude.
After busy signal for many times when I did get through they put me on hold for which seemed like forever.
I hung up and called back and had to go through the busy signals about 5 times again before getting through.
Then when you do get through you have to deal with a very nasty staff.
Maybe over worked...?
The office manager Peggy is the worst.
They need some phone help so the staff isn't so stressed out.
Hopefully that will help.

When I spotted a rapidly changing mole it freaked me out.
Getting a fast appointment with a top dermatologist can be tough....but his team had me scheduled within 3 days and could not have been nicer.
Dr.Powers is wonderful, has a calm, kind and friendly manner and his team is the same.
I'm a nervous patient and they were terrific.
Highly recommend.---Sue B, Scottsdale

I"M SURPRISED THE REVIEWER BEFORE ME got in so fast.
The receptionist called to confirm my appt tomorrow but I am going on vacation and didn't make it for the day I leave!
the scheduler was so rude and nothing was available until July!
I have an weird  spot on my scalp and Quite worried so guess how much fun I've had trying to see someone???
2 friends recommended powers but will not be returning.
