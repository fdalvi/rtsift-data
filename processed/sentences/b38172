HellBilly is building my Custom bike from the frame up, Mike is very knowledgable and has been a pleasure to work with.
This shop is easy going and reasonably priced.
I will post pics of my when completed.
Thanks HellBilly!!

I took my stock Sportster 1988 and made a custom bike that all people can enjoy he has a very fair prices and what he doesn't have you can order FAST everything I ordered I got in about 2 days very fast service friendly service and the fact that he's a marine as well as I am made it even better.
If you're looking for a custom bike to be build from the ground up had a good cost talk to Michael ..

Was great to know that in addition to custom bike building they also perform regular bike maintenance!
Took my 2009 FLHTC in for 35K cycle, rides smooth as always.
The maintenance cycle cost was very reasonble.
I'll be taking my bike to this HellBilly for all my service needs, and when I'm ready to custom out my bagger.
Thanks, Michael!
