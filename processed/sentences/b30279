Great new women's clothing boutique in Grayhawk... store looks great.

This shop has SUCH CUTE THINGS!
I work right next door and drop in occasionally.
I've bought a couple of things and they're holding up well.
Their prices aren't too high like some N. Scottsdale boutiques.
They're not Target prices, but the quality is there and you're not going to have to finance a new outfit.
They usually have a sale rack in the back, too.
Plus nice accessories too.

Walked through this store with my husband a few months ago... went like this: "Oh I like that... this is nice....wow this would be great to wear on our Mexico vacation...etc.
" I like that they have so many nice and unique looking dresses and shirts for ladies.
Prices are fair for the quality too.
Oh yea, I got a very nice knit dress from Urban Lace for my birthday a few weeks after window shopping - see ladies sometimes our guys do listen.
