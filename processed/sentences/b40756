Umm, what did I just eat?
9:47 pm and I had a sweet tooth, it was way in the back lol.
I had just taken my kids to Baskin Robbins a few days earlier but I didn't get anything that' time, my kids really loved it, but they're kids lol.
Anyway I call them up to see what time they closed and to my surprise they were still open, close at 10 pm.
I'm there in 5 minutes and decided on my favorite ice cream of all time, Butter Pecan.
It was disgusting, extremely flavor LESS!
I'm not sure if it was the ice cream or the cone but there's a burned taste in my mouth, never again will I go there, the employees were nice though...  My 2 scoop waffle cone was $4.56, not to expensive but I still want a refund.

I grew up with clown cones as a kid,  and am super excited to have this business in the area.
I purchased an ice cream cake for my dad, and it was great.
Tasty and the price was reasonable.
The staff are super friendly and the store looks very nice.
I cannot wait to try all the flavors and mixtures they have this summer.

I love the ice cream here...my all time fav is chocolate and pistachio.
Recently i discovered love spell and fell in love..vanilla a raspberry ice cream with dark chocolate hearts filled with some sort of sweet filling...DELICIOUS...I also ordered a cake and they are very helpful in the ordering process and were able to customize my cake!
