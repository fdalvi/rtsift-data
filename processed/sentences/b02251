Thrift stores are great for a lot of different reasons, especially this time of year.
Goodwill does a lot for the community, and I try to support them when I can.
This past weekend was no exception.
I had done some cleaning in my apartment, and had a few things to donate.
I wanted it to go somewhere where people would actually be able to use it..and Goodwill it was.
They got a set of my old dishes and a few outfits that I felt were time for me to part with.
As with all other Goodwills, I donated the items in the back to a nice guy, who gave me a coupon for shopping off my next order.
Anyways, I will always be back to my local Goodwill for donating any time of the year!

This is the closest Goodwill to my daughter's so I have shopped in here several times, usually with good success.
When she had her baby early I came in here and was happy to find several cute preemie items and baby blankets and sheets for my new grandson.
Everything on the racks was immaculately clean and unstained.
She loved what I bought.
I've been back a couple of times and always find cute clean things.
I'm due to go there again for the next size up as he keeps growing!
I've also found some good deals on yarn for the hand knitted preemie hats I make to donate, tho sometimes their prices are almost as much as new yarn at Michaels.

I stopped by this Goodwill located on Southern Ave and Stewart on 9/23/2011 to donate some items and discovered that it was closed.
They moved to 1046 S Country Club Dr. (480-844-0906).
The new location is next to Bookman's on the NW corner of Southern Ave and Country Club Dr.

Don't let the fancy fa√ßade fool you: This is the saddest, dingiest, most disappointing Goodwill I have ever visited.
Ever spot a cute guy or girl from across the room, then you get up close and they've got a unibrow, halitosis, and aren't actually wearing pants?
This is that Goodwill.
