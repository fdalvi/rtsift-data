I love that not only the staff listens to you, but so do the doctors!
After an unsuccessful attempt to find a new eye doctor in Chicagoland where I currently reside, I found myself back up in Madison for my eye appointment.
I wanted to go to someone I knew I could trust, who wouldn't take me for a ride...
I love that they take my vision insurance, as well as many others, the place is always clean and organized and the frame selection is great too.
After working in the optical field for many years, I can honestly say that Dr.'s Rick and Angie Olson are the most professional and sincere optometrists I've met.

Absolutely my go-to optometrist.
I've been nothing but happy with my vision, and I honestly feel welcome, and well taken care of every time I call and see my doctor.

Thank you to a great place from the front door sales to the Dr.  Staff went out of their way to get me 2 pairs of glasses in a rush prior to a trip I wanted them for.
They also handled all insurance for me.
Great selection of glasses too!
