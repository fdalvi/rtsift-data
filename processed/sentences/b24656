Clean, quick, and accurate order -- what more could one want from a taco bell drive through!

I'm a frequent customer here- but my advice to anyone ordering from the drive-thru is to order your drink without ice.
Whenever I get it with ice, that's about all I get.
Driving home I'll take three sips and I'll be out of soda!

Fast service and before you go up to the window to pay and get your food they ask if your order is correct on the screen which I like a lot that they do that.
I am giving this place a 4 out of 5 stars only because they messed up a part of my order.
Besides that I really like this Taco Bell out of a lot that I have been to.

This is our usual tb so I gotta represent.
Good: Chicken quesadilla  Bad: Sometimes a long line  One time they forgot to give us the sauce...
So not as good!
This last time the guy must have sensed it because he have us like 20 so he made it up to is:)  The order has never been wrong that I can recall.

It's Taco Bell.

Not bad for Taco Bell.
Happier Hour has great deals.
Aura and Rose are two front end rock stars in my opinion.
