I was out on errands today when suddenly I came upon this Church's, so of course I slammed on the brakes & whipped in here!
:-))  The bathroom was clean & provided paper towels to wash up for lunch & get out with your hands clean.
Having one of their often-mailed coupons on hand, I ordered a Two-Piece Meal, which produced a (Spicy) chicken leg, a big thigh, a cup of mashed potatoes & gravy, & a biscuit plus spread.
The staff was friendly, the dining room comfortable, the food delicious, & it was a pleasure to eat here today where everything was right!
2-Piece Leg & Thigh Lunch Special:  $1.99!

I don't typically review fast food chains but this location just asked for it.
I wish I could give one star for this sorry excuse for a fried chicken chain.
Not only do they have the WORST customer service ever (well, okay maybe not ever - I think Long Wong's MIGHT still have a slight edge) but they always forget the jalape√±os.
I mean, ALWAYS.
Why is that?!?!
And be warned - in this digital age, this company is a dying breed.
They absolutely WILL NOT accept digital coupons, it MUST be in paper with NO exceptions.
Even when the digital coupons have a coupon code printed in bright red on the top left hand corner and no barcode.
Apparently their staff isn't bright enough to tip-tap-type these codes into the magical box of buttons and numbers to make the coupon effective.
LAME.
After my now second horrible experience at this Church's location, I'm Popeye's 4 LIFE!

Really slow on drive thru my husband and i sat in our car for maybe over 15min.
and the past two times I've been there they had no ranch or honey.
A real horrible experience, never again will I go there.
