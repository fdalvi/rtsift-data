Michael at ruff housing goes above and beyond to pamper your pet so they will feel  at home and be comfortable.
Dogs are constantly walked, played with and even get to go to the dog park each day.
Status updates are provided daily with pictures or video's.
Dogs are supervised 24 hrs a day, get alot of attention and can sleep anywhere, including his bed.
Strongly recommend and would use again.

The best doggie daycare service!
I felt so comfortable leaving my 3 month old puppy for the first time.
He sent me video and photo updates, so I could see how well my pup was interacting with the other dogs.
There is cameras on the dogs at all times, so I can always watch my pup through an app on my phone.
I don't think Id ever feel comfortable using another doggie daycare.
I have recommended and told so many people about this one!
And the best part of all?
I can tell my pup absolutely loves going over there.
He even cries the whole car ride home, because he rather stay there than come home with me!
Lol.
So happy I found this place!

I boarded my dog for 28 days with Michael and I'm so glad I did!
He was so good to my dog!
He sent me videos of her, took her to park, hand-fed her when she wouldn't eat from anxiety, and let her sleep in the bed with him!
I love watching her on the cameras and Michael responds to your texts almost instantly if you have any questions or concerns.
I highly recommend this place!

Mike sent me videos on a daily basis of my dog's interaction with the other dogs and other various activities.
He's a very nice guy.
My tea cup Pomeranian was well taken care of, while my family was enjoying a much needed vacation.
