Everardo is professional and friendly.
He was so great to work with and his photography was above and beyond my expectations.
I get so many complements my photos!
I will definitely be shooting with him again!

Everado took our family pictures and he was fantastic!
Professional, creative, and receptive to our ideas as well.
We had an 11 month old with us and he was so patient and understanding.
He worked hard to get great shots and the pictures turned out really good.
Thank you for making this a wonderful experience!

Everardo took my photos when I was nominated for the Palo Verde Women In Business award.
It was going to be published in the paper and in the directory at the awards dinner so I wanted it to be professional yet natural.
He is a great photographer, knows lighting and background for great shots, and he eliminates the awkward feeling of having to fake a smile throughout the shoot!

Everardo really knows his craft.
An exceptional photographer with a creative and unique flare.
Head shots, weddings, portraits...all his work is amazing.

Everardo is awesome.
He did a great job with our senior, and we both had a great time at his studio.
He has another one in Scottsdale, which we went to.
He did tons of different poses and got great shots of her.
I'm so glad we got a professional like Everardo to take these pictures, she is so eager to grow up and we are going to miss her!
