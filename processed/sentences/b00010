I've been taking my adorable old english sheepdog here since I got him as a puppy over 6 yrs ago.
The staff has always been great about getting me in for appointments even with short notice.
The new clinic is very nice, always clean, and set up well.
They willingly give you all the treatment options available and corresponding pricings, which always seem reasonable.
My guy has had some issues over the years (hematoma on his ear that needed to be surgically drained) and the staff treated him super well and helped him recover quickly.
I no longer live in McFarland, but I still drive out there to keep going to this clinic.

Spartan Animal Hospital is a fantastic place.
I am a seriously poor college grad and I took my new cat (from the shelter) to Spartan for her rabies and FVRCP booster shots today.
I was really impressed with the staff and the facility.
The people were extremely friendly and were patient and willing to answer all of my questions.
They gave me a folder full of good information and the home phone number of Dr. C, the owner, in case of non-office hour emergencies.
That's dedication.
The best part about Spartan is that they don't charge the regular office fee if you're just coming in for vaccinations!
It's a rare thing to be pleasantly surprised at a cash register, isn't it?
I highly recommend Spartan to you!
