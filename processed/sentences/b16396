CVS is known as a great Pharmaceutical chain that also offers everyday grocery items.
This store located off the 215 and Valley Verede is a great addition to this wonderful chain.
The savings and weekly specials are very hard to beat at CVS.
I have always enjoyed the service and 24 hour drive through Pharmacy at almost every location.
Awesome store!!

Best pharmacists anywhere - Johnathan and Ira!
