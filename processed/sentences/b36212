Beautiful lake shore area of Lake Mendota on the UW-Madison campus.
Numerous trails and a bike path.
We just happened on this area of the campus by accident.
This place is mostly definitely a destination for those who love the outdoors, exercise and don't have the time to get out of the city (Madison) to find mother nature.
A peaceful, beautiful place.

The best running path I could find in Madison -- scenic the entire way.
You share the path with bikers for about 1/2 the route, but most of those areas are pretty wide, so there isn't too much conflict.

Love.
Lakeshore.
Path.
My freshman year I lived in the Lakeshore dorms and had such a love/hate (mainly hate) relationship with it because it was, like, 100 miles from downtown!
Then one day I realized I was living in a freaking beautiful place literally feet from a lake and miles of well-maintained dirt paths for running, walking, and biking.
The path winds past the marching band practice field, out to picnic point, and can lead you over to the Eagle Heights woods.
Look, there's even a cool interactive map!
http://lakeshorepreserve.wisc.edu/imap/LakeshoreNaturePreserve.html  From Memorial Union to Picnic point is about 2.5 miles.
If you continue to hug the shore you can squeeze in a bit of trail running out to Frautchi Point and beyond.
If you get to the Class of 1918 Marsh and retrace your steps back to the Union you can get in a full 9 miles.
Rockin'!
