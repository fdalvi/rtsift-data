I love Auntie Anne's!
Generally the pretzels are soft, delicious and crispy on the outside.
I do have to say the pretzels are a bit too salty so hence the 4 stars.
For a quick snack at the mall after a hard day of shopping, this is the perfect place.

I ordered a large diet coke with no ice.
Cost $2.50.
It was refreshingly bubbly and hit the spot.

After 4 hours of exploring and endless walks with my mom, our feet were starting to give in and what better way to relax than with a pretzel - an almond pretzel to be exact.
Their prices are reasonable, pretzels were scrumptious and there are tables and chairs overlooking the runway right below just in case you decide to catch the fashion show - held every hour starting from 1pm-6pm every Sunday.
Great place to stop by for a breather!

We ordered 2 pretzel dogs and they were delicious!
I normally add photos but after the first bite I couldn't stop eating it!
So sorry no picture today lol.
I might have to go back tomorrow just so I can get a pic

I love this place.
They've been in the mall since I first started.
They are the only place in the mall, that a mall employee can get a large drink for $1.00.
With tax, it comes out to $1.07.
I've had many variations of their pretzels... Each time I was more than satisfied!
My favorite menu item is the Pretzel Dog.
The one negative thing I have to say is, the opening crew needs to pay better attention to turning the lights on in time...
There have been many times I've had to ask, "Are you open?
"  For a quick snack at the mall, I'd definitely recommend this business.
I will continue to do business with them, as long as I am in that mall.
