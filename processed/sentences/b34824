I've been coming to this Sally's location since they opened and the customer service is exceptional compared to other locations.
The staff seems to be more knowledgeable.
My sister in law and I recently came here for hair dye and the staff was extremely helpful in assisting us on what color and brand choices that were best suited for us.
They even pointed out that the best brand to go with was even on sale at buy one get one free.
Who doesn't love a sale?
I know I do!
The prices here are affordable and they almost always have a sale.
Parking is fairly easy.
They are located next  to GNC, nail salon, and Game Stop at the Arroyo Crossing Shopping Plaza.
Tip:  Ladies if your man is out shopping with you and you need to make a stop here, they can go inside the Game Stop next door.
That should buy you some shopping time, cause though this store is small, I'm sure you can easily spend plenty of time in here.

I've been shopping at this Sally's location for years and have never had any issues.
I ended up having to return a defective product and received a completely different treatment.
Apparently the store wasn't able to take the product back and I would have to deal with the warranty process, which is completely fine.
What I found unacceptable was the fact that when I gave constructive feedback about the Sally's extended warranty, not only was I spoken to in an extremely condescending manner, but the manager actually walked away from me.
It's amazing that a supervisor would be willing to lose the business of a long-time customer by choosing to argue over a policy instead of just offering to pass on the information.
I will never shop at this location again and suggest that anyone who expects good customer service avoid it as well.
