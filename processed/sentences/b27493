i just love guilty lily's.
and i kinda like that whenever i go there, it seems quite quiet?
obviously not great for business, but certainly very enjoyable for me.
and it such a quirky bar, it is a genuine pleasure to hang out in it.
it is the perfect bar to spend a hungover sunday.
i've probably eaten here a dozen times, and the food is always faultless.
their burgers are probably some of the best i've ever had, and i used to eat a lot of burgers (sadly for me i have stopped eating meat, happily for the animals, i have stopped eating meat.
if i was to break my meat fast, it would probably be here that i do it)

As a tourist hitting them up for brunch and pub quiz, it felt lucky to find this place.
It's a bit out of the way.
They're quality.
Their brunch was great for tourists because they do a full haggis brunch and offer a tasty vegetarian version too.
The pesto mushrooms were excellent.
Came back later for drinks and more quality!
They serve Posh Pimms by glass or pitcher, and make the ginger juice fresh to order.
Good place for day drinking!
