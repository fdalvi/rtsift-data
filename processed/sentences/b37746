Friendly and efficient

We use SNOHC for our business to complete TB testing as we work in hospitals.
They are timely and efficient.
I would recommend for your business to use for drug screening, hospital testing, etc.....  Michelle C.

I had to use the services of the occupational health center as part of new hire exam for a newly acquired job.
The staff was nice and friendly and the wait time was relatively short.
I did have to come back a second time due to a test being inconclusive which is no fault of the clinics at all.
I would say the service was consistent.
I would recommend this place to others if they needed occupational health services.

Horrible experience, I literally got kicked out by the Dr.
I had to wait an hour and the dr wouldn't see me cause my kids were there and being kids.
I had no problems in California they got me in and out for my workers comp.
I get penalized cause I have kids, office staff is rude and a new girl up front didn't even schedule my appt that I had she just looked like a deer in headlights the whole time.
Very un organized.
Smelled like an ash tray in there.
