Called these guys to install in a new gas line for our range.
It was A1 from start to finish.
Nice guy, showed up on time, went right to work and the finished product looked professional.
No surprise pricing...it was exactly what they originally quoted.
If you need their service, go for it.. no concerns with these guys at all.
I wouldn't hesitate next time I need them.

Was calling everywhere to get a plumber for an emergency (Valve broke).
These guys were the BEST!
Not to mention they quoted me the best price.
Excellent service!
They were so efficient and very professional.
Going to be calling them again!

These guys came within an hour, two days after Christmas, when I had a houseful of company.
Two men came to take care of a leak I had coming from an upstairs bathroom into a downstairs bathroom, also leaking into a light fixture.
I was impressed with: the professionalism (explained what they thought the problem was, what they were going to do, kept me informed with each step), the promptness (coming within an hour of my call), their "pipeside manner" (like a doctor's "bedside manner"- very kind and very thorough).
Their hunch as to what was wrong proved to be exactly correct.
Although I've used good plumbers before, I will call Thunderbird plumbing first if I need a plumber in the future.
