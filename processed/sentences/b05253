This is my second time to visit this dental office for root canal.
Everyone here is very friendly and welcoming.
Dr Morris is a super nice guy.
He made me feel comfortable and relax during the surgery.
Office is very nice and clean.
They also have very high tech equipment.
This is definitely the best dental endodontics I would recommend it to all my family and friends.

Excellent service and care!
I called in and was given an appointment within 30 minutes!
The were able to not only SQUEEZE us in, but they gave my husband a root canal the same day all within 2 hrs!
Excellent is all i can say!
Thank you Dr. Morris!

FABULOUS!!!!
I can not say enough good things about Dr.'s Shalev and Morris.
I have had three root canals done by them and I never spent more than 45 minutes in the chair.
They talk to you while doing the procedure so you know how far along you are and aren't in the dark wondering how much longer.
Incredible bedside manner and the assistants are so warm and friendly too.
I also felt ZERO pain.
Not even a pinch.
These doctors are so skilled that I didn't even the feel the novacane shot.

EXCELLENT!!!
My first root canal went so smooth.
Three cheers for Dr. Shalev and his staff.
