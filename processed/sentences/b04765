Is "Arizona's Best BBQ" hidden behind Famous Dave's BBQ in Peoria?
Well, yes and no.
The sign out front boldly declared it but I'm not too sure myself...
Personally, I'm often a bit of a contrarian as in I like to look for the non-obvious.
In my continual quest to find something redeeming about Peoria, I find a BBQ place tucked behind Famous Dave's and right next to Arrowhead Harley- so I figure that this'll be my hidden gem, right?
I mean, a small BBQ place literally behind a chain operation like Famous Dave's has to either *really* bring or they'll soon be out of business, right?
Well... not to be mean but something tells me that there will be a space for rent in not too long...  Not that anything was really terrible.
The staff was friendly enough.
I ordered the half-rack of ribs with two sides.
It was $14.
Sure, there were lunch sandwiches in the $7-$9 range but BBQ to me means ribs.
And for $14 in a "hole in the wall" place should be large portions and fabulous.
I really can't say it was either.
And I wanted to like it.
The portions were OK but not $14 in size or quality.
I almost wanted to hit up Chipotle on my way out of Arrowhead...
I'd definitely skip this place...

I have been to this restaurant several times and actually really enjoyed it.
The other reviews appear to be somewhat mediocre, but I really feel their foods flavor made it worthwhile.
I will definitely be back and now that I am sitting down to do a review, I am going to head there today for lunch.
: )  {UPDATE}  Well  - I went back there for lunch today and they were closed, and long gone from what I could tell.
It was a mexican restaurant and I will not be eating there.
It looked kind of dirty actually.
Well, goodbye AZ BBQ!
In case anyone wonders, I ate over at Famous Daves.
Kind of sucked.
