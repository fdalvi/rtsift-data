Next has never been a shop I've ever really bothered about and I've certainly never understood why there's always a mile long queue outside Next branches at 5 in the morning on sale days... it's crazy!
I popped into this branch recently to check out the baby clothes as a friend of mine has recently had a little boy and when he was born I got him a couple of really cute baby grows from the Next Glasgow branch so decided to pop in here.
I got him a super cute little t-shirt and when I was queuing up I noticed a selection of birthday cards and wrapping paper all on a 4 for the price of 3 offer.
I snapped up a mix of cards and wrapping as I have no many birthdays coming up and the cards on offer were very pretty.
Overall, Next isn't somewhere I'd really shop as it just doesn't really appeal to me but it definitely comes in handy sometimes!

Next is the kind of place you begin shopping when you're teens start to become a worryingly distant memory, and you're comfortable enough in yourself not to really give a toss about being at the sharp end of fashion, or attracting attention to yourself.
Ticks all the boxes for me then, and surprisingly good jeans.

You know what, you can't really fault Next.
I'm only giving it 4* because it's just not quite there yet....don't you think?
It's like that underachiever in your class at school.
The brains were there but they never did their homework and so didn't do well.
The potential is there but it's just not channeled correctly....yet.
Everyone has a next outfit, right?
It's pretty brilliant stuff if we're honest.
All my teachers wore things from next.
This branch is quite good, quite big and the staff are really friendly.
I always laugh at the fact their tills say 'Remember to smile' - as if you'd forget....!
