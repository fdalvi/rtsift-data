What's with all these businesses proclaiming "Best" in their titles, you're just setting yourself up to be Yelped.
My experience with Best Kebab couldn't have been more routine, except when I placed my order.
The guy at the counter rung up the order and...pulled my chips from under the counter...all ready...like he made it 5 minutes before I even arrived.
Now, if they can time travel and freshly cook my order before i've even entered the shop, then they can have the title Best Kebab.
But in reality, I can only imagine how long it had been sitting there and walked out the shop as fast as I could.

This is certainly not the 'best' kebab house I've been to, nor will it probably be the best that anyone's been to.
There's nothing really wrong with the service, it's friendly enough and they serve the food pretty quickly.
The problem is the food.
The kebabs in most takeaways look quite greasy and fatty, but these are in a whole other coronary leage altogether.
The donner meat which I tasted was salty and fatty, the salad wasn't too fresh and the chips weren't great either.
It was quite cheap, costing only about Â£3, but even this was steep considering the poor quality.
Maybe I came at a bad time for them, but when there are so many decent takeaways in the area it's unlikely that I'll be back.

When the guy who named this place the 'best' kebab house has a child I'm betting he will call it something like Dr. Cure-Cancer.
He will then go on to be suprised when the child fails his first exam and drops out to become a kebab shop owner instead.
Thats the sort of dissapointment you will feel when entering this kebab shop.
The food is poor, the service is poor and overall the price is poor.
Not a great place, certainly not the 'Best'.

No, it's not the best kebab house ever, but by no means the worst.
On a kebab scale of pissed to Michelin, they are easily a 3, and gain a pont for great service, especially late night.
And those potatoes?
Oh they are good.
