The latest combatant to throw their hat in the ring of Holyrood-based cafes, the Holyrood Cafe doesn't do any better or any worse than its peers.
What it does differently say to the likes of BBL, is that it uses it's space to the benefit of the customer rather than itself, offering a selection of sit-in spaces.
Not many mind, Holyrood could probably squeeze a total of 10 people within its small confines but the fact that it does that when BBL has much more space yet offers only 3 seats, as well as the fact the man in charge works out of a space no bigger than the Children's BBC Broom Closet (remember that?
Gordon the Gopher, Ed the Duck, Andy Peters, Andy Crane....
I'm gonna stop now!
), is in itself commendable.
Unfortunately the menu suffers as a result.
Holyrood simply isn't able to offer the range of BBL, Chapters, Fresco or Let Me Eat.
Even the hot morning roll fillings are limited.
But the prices are slightly less than its competitors, so again, points for that.
In truth I can't see myself coming here for anything more than a morning roll, but the lad that mans the counter is nice enough, the prices are decent and the place looks good.
So I hope they do well.

Known at my work as "the man on the corner" the holyrood cafe is the main supplier of breakfast rolls for the work force.
It's all pretty standard fare, and fairly standard price.
The falafel wrap was surprisingly tasty though.
I think I'd give this place 4 stars if they got a decent fridge for their soft drinks.
Open fridges suck, frankly.
They don't really cool down the drinks, and actually heat up the room their in.
You can sit in but there's nothing particular to write about in that regard.
All in all pretty good but not quite great.

Small and friendly.
Why does every cafe need to have lots of seating.
Highly recommended, very reasonably priced (Â£1.10) for a piece of choc chip shortbread.
I'm all for little gems like this over a Starbucks or Costa anyday.
Also first place I've ever got a milk and honey in.
