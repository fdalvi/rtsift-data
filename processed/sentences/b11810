Pretty good service, the cashier clerk is almost always pretty laid back and helpful.
The gas pumps are plentyful, they have a really huge amount of pumps.
Good selection of snacks and drinks.

Purchased a couple of bottled waters and handed the cashier a $20.
She asked if had anything smaller.
And I said "no.
" She got snippy and said it would take a little while before she could give me change...all the while shaking her head and cussing under her breath.
Wow!
Must have been a bad day for her, but jeez!

Gas station that has a McDonalds and is right off Centennials Auto Dealer row.
There are a large amount of pumps and the inside is kept clean.
Not a bad place to stop if your close by, they offer Chevron gasoline.

Much better service than the Fabulous Freddy's nearby.
It's a little further from my house but I'm willing to drive for good service!
The workers are fast and friendly.

I am a huge fan of Terrible Herbst in Vegas, but will no longer be using credit cards to pay for gas at Chevron anymore since today I found out that they pre-authorized not only the $38.00 worth of gas I filled up with, but also $126.00.
Chevron/Terrible's a $1 hold is more than enough!
Beware!

Make sure if you go here for an oil change, that your oil cap is on before you leave.
I noticed an oil leak after an oil change and found my oil cap laying on top of the motor.
I went back again for another oil change, told them what had happened, and to please make sure the cap is replaced.
Once again I noticed an oil leak and find the oil cap laying on the motor.
Once ok, but twice?

Be very careful if you use a Credit/Debit Card here, the other night I went to get gas and the pump I was at was apparently all out?
So I cancelled the transaction and moved to a different pump and for 24 hours I was charged $126 twice!
Before it finally turned into $40.
Man, I was about to kill this Chevron for overcharging me but luckily it was fixed within 24 hours.
