Lorraine will help you get into an apartment asap.
Truly amazing woman.
One of the cleanest complexes Ive ever been to.
Top notch luxurious for the price.
They even have a water purification system on sight.

The apartment units are spacious and affordable (of course, the longer your lease contract, the more affordable).
The buildings in the  complex itself are clean and well-maintained.
One of the things that sets this apart from other apartment complexes is the presence of so many large shady trees and spacious inner courtyards; it really is nice to live amidst so much greenery when you're living in the middle of a desert city.
The staff is courteous and efficient, and all the occasional issues I've had, such as with light fixtures or plumbing, were addressed promptly - usually within the same day, or at most, the next day if I reported the issue at or close to management office closing time.
It is a gated community, and I did not experience any security issues in the 4 years that I lived here.

There were a lot of reasons as to why I was drawn to this property.
The first being the location.
It's close to everything, fast food, dine in restaurants, grocery stores, metrocenter mall, transit lines, and close proximity to the freeway.
The second reason I chose this property is the attentive manner of the maintenance and landscaping staff.
I have to say I'm not particularly fond of huge apartment complexes because they tend to look rundown and management usually is impersonal, but the park - like setting and friendly staff had me sold.
The office staff are more than welcoming and were on top of any issues I had regarding normal wear and tear.
I recommend this property to anyone who is looking for their money's worth.
