Reasonably priced liquor/beer and wide selection.
Staff friendly and helpful.
They do NOT however carry kegs.

what can i say except....the word "discount" when it applies to alcohol just freaking rocks!!

Let me say that I love this place.
Problem is, they are never open late enough and aren't really that inexpensive/discount.
Having said that, man do they have the booze!
I found Samuel Smith Nut Brown ale On Sale here just two weeks ago and have stopped there on many occasions for party essentials.
It never hurts that I can walk here either.
Give it a try!

Good selection, good prices, friendly staff.
This business is a Circle-K subsidiary.
My only complaint is the number of people looking for day labor that loiter in the parking lot - They always try to approach my vehicle when I'm pulling in.
Annoying!

Closed - So sad!
