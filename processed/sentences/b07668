Was able to book an appointment for the next day.
Gail (manager) was very friendly and explained to me how the process works.
They quoted me 4 hours, and I was out the door in 2 hours flat.
They had a small waiting room with free wi-fi, a tv, vending machine and some magazines.
Even the bathroom was very clean and well stocked.
As for the actual spray-in bedliner, it looks really nice, and as far as what I could tell, they did a pretty good job.
Already got a few compliments on it.

Mark and his team are real professionals.
They were able to squeeze me in on a Monday with little notice and explained the product and process thoroughly.
They had my new Tundra done within hours and I was very pleased with the results.
However, they had forgotten to put back a few bolts back which I did not notice at first.
However, he had the integrity to call me and come to my home to make sure the job was 100% done.
You don't find many business owners with such dedication and pride in their work these days.
I HIGHLY recommend Mark and his team and Arizona Line-X.

I was charged $65 to remove and reinstall a tonneau cover while having the bed sprayed.
Manufacturer quotes less than 30 minutes, but it is closer to 10-15 to install.
The cover was reinstalled incorrectly by the LineX tech.
I would expect the technician to know what he is doing if they are charging that much.
