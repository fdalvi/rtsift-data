In any line of business, there are a ton of companies that are mediocre, a ton of companies that are just "OK", and a handful of companies that are really good.
And then... every once in a great while... you find a company that is truly exceptional - absolutely excellent on every level.
Dry Plus Roofing is one of those truly exceptional companies.
It's not often that you fine a company that operates with the level of integrity and honesty that I've encountered at Dry Plus.
Rewind 2.5 years: A few months after buying my house, I came home in the rain to find water in my kitchen.
Typically, I'm a DIY person.
Rewire a circuit?
No problem.
Install some ducting?
Bring it on.
Fixing the roof.... That is one for the pros.
(Or so I thought.
)  I called 5 highly rated roofing companies to come out and give me a bid.
Dry Plus was the last to arrive, so by the time Kevin (the owner) showed up, I had been given 4 different stories on why my roof leaked, what all needed to be repaired immediately, and had 4 quotes ranging from $700 to $1800.
Kevin arrived and, within 5 minutes, pointed out 4 slashes in the roofing material the others had missed, positively identifying them as the issue.
I brought up some of the other companies' theories on what might be the problem, and he explained why all those things were non-issues.
Convinced, I asked what next.
His answer - which won my business forever, was:  "Well, I can charge you $400 to come out here and fix this, and do some other maintenance.
Or, if you're handy, I can tell you what you need to buy, and what you need to do, and you can fix this yourself for $30.
"  Sold.
Fast forward to 8/2012.
Monsoon hits and I have water pouring in above a window.
Who do I call?
Dry Plus.
It's 2 days before they can come out, though, so I go up on the roof and - using my "training" from Kevin years ago - fix the leak myself.
I have a couple other issues, though, so I don't cancel the appointment.
Paul arrives and approves of my fix, and suggests I do the same thing to a few other places on my roof.
As he's wandering around he sees a couple other minor issues, and.... fixes them.
A shingle here, a nail there... done.
No charge.
There's one thing he can't just fix (neither he nor I have the materials), so he tells me what I need to get and what to do.
I show him another spot that is giving me trouble - a separate roof that isn't draining correctly.
He confirms my suspicion that it has the wrong roofing material, is missing critical components (e.g.
flashing), really should be re-roofed.
He draws up a quote, and apologizes that it is so expensive - even though it is less than I was anticipating!
Without hesitation, I signed.
They'll be out in a week or two to do the work.
When they come out, I'll update this review to reflect the quality of their work.
I have no doubt that aspect of their company will be just as 5-star as the rest.
Very very very highly recommended.

I had a leak that was draining in from the roof through a window so I called Dry Roofing since they are in the neighborhood and have good reviews.
It wasn't an emergency so Paul came over a few days later.
He got up on my roof repaired a couple of places he thought could be the source of my problem.
He sprayed water on if for a while and no water came through so I think he did the job!
When I asked him what I owed him he said there was no charge.
Where do you get that kind of service these days?
I mean most people in the service arena charge for a trip charge on top of their labor and parts.
He didn't charge for the caulking, travel or time.
I fully expected a hard sell on needing a new roof but that didn't happen.
I asked Paul how the roof was holding up and he said I probably had a couple of years left in it.
He even told me that I could take the replacement in portions so as to avoid a major financial hit all at once when the time came.
I am so impressed with dry roofing that I will be calling them for the new installation a couple of years down the road.
If you want a trustworthy company, I strongly suggest Dry Plus Roofing.
They go the extra mile, a rare thing indeed!

Dry Plus Roofing came out the day after we called and gave us some options for our roof.
Definitely no pressure and they had a 7 day quote guarantee.
The crew cleaned up our yard, very pleased with the services we received.

Dry Plus Roofing just completed a re-roof of one of our houses and I am very pleased with the craftsmanship and thoroughness of the work.
New drip edge, replaced bad wood, new vents and clean-up all done efficiently and in a professional manner.
The foreman, Heath, kept me informed every step of the way.
We got off to a good start with the estimate and scheduled the work for three weeks out.
For some unknown reason they missed the first date and rescheduled a week out.
Living in the desert and being after monsoon season it was not an issue.
I would use Dry Plus Roofing again.
