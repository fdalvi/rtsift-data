One of my favorite and most memorable trail runs.
Very steep but relatively short climb to the top (I believe less than a mile).
Very rocky and surrounded by some nice flat trails around the hill.
If this were closer it would be in my weekly routine.
Very strenuous.
Great views of the city.

Well, this little hike is good for beginners.
It was my first time today.
I was expecting a little intense hike but it was ok.
It probably took us (my kids and me) 20 min to get up there, then hanged out for a little bit.
It's was good light cardio.
I'll come here again since it's only couple miles from my house.
