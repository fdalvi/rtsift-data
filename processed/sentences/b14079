I  was recommended to Egoscue by my Physical therapist.
He told me due to my insurance he was limited to what he could do for me and said if I wanted to recover from my injuries it would happen at Egoscue.
I did recover and discovered it helped my Fibromyalgia.
I have been going there on and off for about 7 years, why?
With my fibromyalgia I find great relief from my pain and I have better overall functioning when I participate in the Egoscue method.
The owners John and Billie are fabulous and very helpful.
Maria my therapist is wonderful!
When I go there on my own to do my menu, they will offer a tip or add an exercise if I mention a pain or discomfort I may be experiencing.
There are truly caring professionals and I would highly recommend them to anyone.

I came to the Egoscue Phoenix clinic over my honeymoon.
I was blown away at the results on got that very day and they continued to improve over time.
I was a therapeutic exercise specialist for the last 6 years.
I used my best therapy on myself and I couldn't get the pain relief that I received through the Egoscue Method.
I had chronic migraines, sciatica, a bulging disc in my neck with nerve pain into my arm and knee pain (before and after my ACL tore).
I am happy to say after working with John, Billie and Maria, I am absolutely PAIN FREE from all of my symptoms.
I was so taken with Egoscue that I now relocated from Wisconsin to Phoenix and work at the clinic!!
I'm on a mission to help as many people experience the same pain relief that I have.
Egoscue gave me my confidence back to play the sports and do that activities that I love the most.
Thanks so John, Billie and Maria!
