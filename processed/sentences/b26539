Over priced and under portioned!!!!
and it all crap!!

What a fabulous coffee shop!
This place had a nice selection of made to order Starbucks coffees, as well as breakfast sandwiches, lunch options, and all sorts of healthy snacks.
The staff is rather friendly as well, which always makes the experience that much more enjoyable!

This is a coffee shop deli in the hotel and if your looking for a quick breakfast, lunch or snack this is the best option in the area.
The coffee is better than the sandwiches and even though its a bit pricey its still cheaper to eat here than Rick's Cafe which is one of the few other lunch options in the area.
They have a larger selection of other convenience store type items here as well.
