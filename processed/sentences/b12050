A cute, colorful little coffee shop catering to the indie and punk set.
A punky clothing store/head shop shares the second floor landing next to the cafe.

It was the best coffeeshop in all of Madison.
And then it closed (was it 2003 or 2004?
) So, so sad.

It was!
THE BEST!!!!!
Starbucks moved in and State St. hit its maximum capacity for cafes, and Assisi was on the second floor, tucked away - so despite its loyal regulars, it shut down since it couldn't pick up the to-go traffic.
That's the story of its end.
Its twenty-year history, with two sets of owners and its reincarnation as a collective, is another story.
