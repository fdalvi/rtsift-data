Dr Austin is incredibly thorough with pt and family history.
She personally spent a lot of time with me.
Dr. Austin has awesome bedside manners and is very personable.
This is a small well run office.
Staff is also personable.
Dr. Austin is a stellar example of a great doctor.
I can't imagine that a patient would be turned away if they showed up in need without an appointment.

I've been mis-diagnosed many times by Dr. Austin.
The wait is ALWAYS an hour or two and you have to keep calling the office to get results.

Dr. Austin is an amazing physician.
She is compassionate, caring and thorough.
She is the only physician in her office, which means when she needs to provide more time to patients before you, you will wait.
But guess what, one day that may be you--you may need that extra time.
So I have never once been upset if my appointment wasn't started at the exact minute it was scheduled.
She has been my primary doctor for over seven years and unless she retires, she will be my primary physician for the foreseeable future.
If your treatment requires more specialized treatment, she knows who and where to send you.
As a middle aged man I purposely chose Dr. Austin because she is smart, compassionate, listens, thorough and has never once said "fully booked" when I've asked to see her for ANY reason that day.
If you are looking for a great doctor, Dr. Austin is it 100%.
