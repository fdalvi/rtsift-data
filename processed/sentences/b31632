3.5/5  Thai Bistro is located in the heart of Belmont Village (which I must say is quite a unique community in Kitchener!).
Before entry, it does look like a completely run down place (i.e: hole in the wall establishment), but don't let that scare you away!
I ordered a chicken pad thai, along with a glass of water.
Overall the pad thai was decent, except the fact there was an imbalanced proportion of noodles and other ingredients, and it felt like I continuously ate chicken, bean sprouts, and carrots instead of the noodles themselves.
Sad though, since I found the noodles (and sauce) very tasty and the chicken not very special.
Service was okay, however I had to wait about 5-10 minutes for an employee to come out and clear one of the tables since all the tables were covered with plates (I arrived at the tail end of the lunch rush).
Also, at the end I had to wait about 5 minutes for an employee to come out and ask for the bill.
It seems to be a family joint, with only 2 (maybe 3) people working, so I can somewhat understand.
I will also try Northern Thai in Downtown in the near future and will make my decision on which one's better.

My favourite place to go for Pad Thai.
The sauce is just right, not too sweet or spicy.
Some other places are too ketchupy flavoured, but its done well here.
The price is perfect too.
$8.95 for pad thai that can usually be split between two people!
You can't beat this

Not the best Thai I've had and I'm not sure its authentic, but good flavour and taste.
Would try again.
