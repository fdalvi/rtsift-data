I like  this Bath and Body works, because it is never too busy, and the sales clerks, are always very helpful !
Went there today to get some holiday home fragrances, also, if you sign up on their web site, they will send you some really Great coupons!

I don't like this particular store at all... customer service gets an "F"!
Love the products though, just wouldn't get my Bath and Body Works "fix" at this location.
Rather go to another Bath and Body Works.

Great location, friendly staff.
