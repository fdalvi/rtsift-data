I've lived just south of this shopping center for 9 months and have been a regular since day one.
Whether I'm shopping at Walmart or eating at one of the many restaurants, I'll find myself at the Happy Valley Towne Center daily.
Everyone talks about Norterra when I tell them where I live.
Well, I think this place is better and more useful overall.

I come here pretty much everyday because there is always something I forgot to grab the day before.
I find this place pretty convenient and a fun place to shop, especially if you like TJ Max, Sephora, Barnes and Noble, and Pier One Imports.
I tend to go to Walmart often (I'm not proud of this) because it is convenient and I live real close........and.......McDonalds is open late inside in case ya get hungry late night.
The parking lot is a bit confusing when driving.
I know it well, but others seem to pull out in front of cars thinking they have a stop sign.
Also, there is a big dip by the traffic light on Happy Valley to look out for.
Go slow.

Pretty much everthing you need!

This shopping center is right near my house, so it's pretty much our one stop shop for whatever we need.
The parking lot is a little dodgy because the traffic is routed all different directions and sometimes there are not stop signs when there probably should be, but if you keep your eyes open it's fine.
