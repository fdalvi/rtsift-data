I recently needed to go to this urgent care and was very happy with the staff and how simple and quick it was.
I was able to check-in on the way there and fill out paperwork online on my phone.
Dr Maryanna Mcglasson was the physician who took care of me.
She really knew what she was talking about and diagnosed me correctly.
I would definitely go back again.

The "doctor" spent 3 minutes with me and diagnosed my illness and gave me 4 prescriptions.
She wouldn't really answer my questions as she was busy and didn't ask many either so her diagnosis was based on a guess at best.
The fee to be not even thoroughly examined was a tad ridiculous.
But this is not the worst part.
They prescribed a weak antibiotic that did not take care of my infection.
To then get an adequate antibiotic they require a new visit with new huge co-pay.
But I am not even really seen by a doctor, they just ask oh you still have it, here is your prescription.
I asked why they couldn't just do that over the phone and I am told they require the additional visit so they can charge me again.
If they had prescribed the correct antibiotic the first time this would not have been needed.
But either they are running a scam knowing that it wouldn't do the job or the doctor couldn't figure out what was needed in her through 3 minute exam with minimal questioned asked.
With so many urgent cares, please skip this one.
Too bad one star is as low as you can rate them.
Take a look at the reviews that are not recommended.
More one stars that do not affect there rating, they truly have a much lower rating.
Terrible
