This is the most progressive, inclusive, welcoming, diverse, intellectually stimulating, public-service oriented church in the Valley, if not the West Coast.
We've been to more than a few and can attest to that.
Pastor Jeff not only knows everyone's name but is genuinely concerned about everything that goes on in your life.
The congregation is like one big family.
Love for your neighbors is not just a commandment at this church - it's acted upon.
If you're sick of churches that tell you what to believe in and don't act what they preach, you'd better check this one out.
Services every Sunday at 9:30am.

Asbury United Methodist is a place for all!
The congregation is welcoming, diverse in age, race and sexual orientation.
Pastor Jeff is a warm person who is real, down-to-earth, and you know that he is passionate about his ministry for the community.
They are social justice minded and teach what true love and compassion (real messege of the Bible) is about.
If you stopped going to church due to being tainted with hypocritical, conservative, and narrow-minded theology, then go to Asbury where you will be refreshed and feel accepted.
The only difference I have is the style of service, which is not the preferred contemporary worship that I prefer; however, everyone varies when it comes to worship style and I have grown to like it.
