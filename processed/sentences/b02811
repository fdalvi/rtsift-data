Didn't like that they waited till fifteen minutes before my appointment to call and tell me insurance had not approved.
I was almost in the parking lot.
They blamed my doctor so I called him.
They had not sent the paperwork until one day earlier.
A week later, surprise, paperwork was fine and I got the M R I on my knee.
Now I have to wait two weeks for the next appointment my knee doc had available.

I have been a customer of EVDI for several years...probably 10+.
They are pleasant thorough and efficient.
No one enjoys going to these check-ups but at least at a place like EVDI you get friendly service.
They take reservations which I highly recommend, but they also allow walk-ins.
That must be a great benefit, if needed.

The staff (once I actually spoke with a real person) are nice and very friendly.
The problem is their "centralized scheduling" and 10+ minute hold times (don't really know how long because the 10-min mark is time for me to give up as my time is just as valuable as theirs).
Several times trying to get through I was just left on hold before giving up.
I finally tried setting an appointment on their website.
Their autobot called the next day and put me on hold yet again.
I hung up.
Finally a real person called at 8pm (yes, pm) to schedule an appointment - all inconvenient times, of course.
So, I won't bother this year with the mammogram unless there's another imaging center out there that my insurance will take.
Or I'll wait for the lil mobile deal to show up the office and I'll walk in there.
They won't put me on hold.
