This Salon is just right up the street from me, and I have never been inside!
I received a coupon for a fee haircut, Yes!
Free!
Sue, was very nice, and took her time cutting my hair, I will difinitely go back!
She just moved here, from Rhode Island, and wanted to build up her clientele, so decided to run the Free Coupon!
She normally charges $40.00 for a haircut and style!

My mom was visiting and wanted a haircut.
She went to Eva and got the best cut I have ever seen on her.
She has been getting tons of compliments on her new style.
I guess now she'll have to come down and visit more often.

I am so pleased with my haircut from Cindy, the owner.
She listened to exactly what I wanted, and the cut turned out beautiful.
What a nice and welcoming place!
I highly recommend coming here.
I just moved in to the area, and am happy to find a place I can return to.

I had a Brazilian Blow Out with Cyndi, the owner.
She did an awesome job and gave me lots of tips about how to better care for my hair.
Best of all, she completed the entire process in less than two hours (I have very thick, shoulder length hair.
)  Cyndi is an experienced veteran in the hair care industry and knows her stuff.
She is very easy to talk to and quite personable.
The Salon is very busy, so call ahead for an appointment.
If you live in the McDowell Mountain Ranch/DC Ranch area, you should definitely give Posh Salon a try.
