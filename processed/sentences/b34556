Erin Kelly owns a chair at Dylan's Salon She is simply amazing she consults with each client and gets a vision of what they want and each time i have my hair done i leave feeling beautiful.
I also enjoy being able to sip on wine from Postinos next door while she does my hair.
Erin is so personable and you leave with an experience.
Stop in and let her use her talents on your hair.

Erin was an absolute doll!
I had never met her before this, and I desperately needed a hairdresser who understood what I was looking for.
She was practically finishing my sentences for me, and talked me through everything she was doing, to ensure she understood exactly what I was looking for, and gave me just that.
I couldn't be happier with my visit to Dylan's salon, and I will be seeing Erin for all my future hair needs!
