what a horrible experience!
do not go here

We've gone there two times.
The first time was fine.
I had a sinus infection, they prescribed antibiotics and sent me home.
The second time was a nightmare.
We went there because my boyfriend had an unusual feeling in his chest.
The nurse who took his vitals was fine, but didn't listen to him about his symptoms.
The doctor he saw was wearing a face mask.
He didn't take off his face mask, which was quite disconcerting for us.
The doctor told us that my boyfriend could have one of three problems, all of which meant he was going to die.
Great bedside manner!
I would recommend going just about anywhere else.
This place is dumpy, and the care you receive is minimal, let alone terrible bedside manner.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE !!!!!
It only got one star because zero stars is not an option.
I took my young son there on a weekend because the pediatrician a office was closed and I knew he had strep and was really feeling awful.
From the moment the doctor walked in before he even looked at my son he started in about he probably has the flu and needs tamiflu.
He sposedly did a strep test that came back negative- although less than 24 hours later the regular ped got a positive test and said it was so bad it would have had to show up positive the day before.
So he prescribed the tamiflu- which we didn't get filled because I knew it was strep.
I personally think he might be getting some kind of kickbacks for prescribing it because it is incredibly expensive and not very effective.
At best he is completely incompetent at worst prescribing and diagnosing to get something out of it.
Meanwhile my poor baby had to suffer through 24 hours needlessly because of him.
