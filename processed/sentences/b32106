I was quoted for fillings and made the payment at the time of service.
Now they are billing and telling me their quote was off since my insurance covered a lowered amount.
What is the point of the office verifying coverage amounts with the insurance company before service only to surprise clients later with a bill???
I specifically asked how much the procedure would cost and now this.
They've lost me and the two in-laws I referred there as customers.

I had some "old" fillings replaced in addition to replacing one with a crown.
Since this was my first crown, I was a little concerned about the pain once the "numbness" were to subside.
Things could not have been better, I could chew like normal and apart from a little soreness in the gum everything was great.
As to the financial part, there was no surprises and I was quoted what I eventually ended up paying.
Highly recommended  88

I'm going to give them two stars because they quoted me a price over the phone for an extraction, and after I got there they wanted to charge me twice as from what was originally quoted.
They ended up doing a procedure that was less expensive than an extraction to help me get out of pain and also buy me some time so I could save up to get 2 root canals.
The procedure didn't work and actually made my pain worse.
I asked for them to pull at least one tooth out since I paid for a procedure that didn't work, and they wanted to charge me an extra 200 for the extraction.
The dentist made me feel a little uncomfortable, as I know I have some issues with my teeth.
He did a good job at making me feel very embarrassed.
However, he did provide me with some pain medication which was very helpful.
I was eternally grateful for that.
Just wish they wouldn't quote a price over the phone and then make up some excuse when you get into the office to double the price.
