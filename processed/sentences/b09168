Not too shabby and only about a mile or so from downtown Tempe!
I pricelined this place for $25 and won.
Explosive.
The room was decked out with a fridge, toaster, nice desk and the queen bed was quite comfy.
My companion and I even even chilled in the outdoor veranda pool area, alongside 10 or so white middle aged golfer types drinking beers and puffing on a few cigarettes.
It was very chill.
The front desk people were quite professional with check in procedures and very helpful with directions.
Very solid hotel for $25!
For the amount paid for this place, it deserves more than an A-OK.

Plus side: Kitchen included cooking/eating utensils, clean, near Tempe hot spots.
Bad side: can get a little noisy, staff was non-existent, and housekeeping services can be an extra charge.
Overall, for the price charged this is a pretty decent deal.

staff was friendly and so was the crowd, but it was a special crowd.
If I'd been booking a hotel would have spend an extra 20-30 and stayed somewhere nicer.
This is a cheap hotel/extended stay and you get what you pay for.

Nothing wrong with hotel as long as you realize it's an extended stay hotel and not the Ritz.
Place is clean and staff is friendly.
I've been here for over a month and had no issues.
