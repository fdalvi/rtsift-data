Stay far away from Alex Motenko.
This Russian is nothing more than a scam artist.
I told him my problem before he showed.
He pressed a couple of buttons, charged my wife $75 and told us we had an expensive paperweight that would cost over $1000 to fix.
I ordered the part myself from shopjimmy.com and paid $74 with shipping.
the part works flawlessly.
SCAMMER  ALERT!
Stay far away from TVision.
I have asked for just a portion of my money back and he refuses.
This guy is a joke.
My next step is driving his internet traffic to a website that exposes everything about him.

There are a lot of jokers out there in the TV Repair business, and believe me, I ran into all of them when I was shopping around looking for someone to fix my rear-projection HDTV.
Alex had the lowest in-home rate ($75) which went toward any parts or additional labor.
He was very personable, and now my TV's picture looks as good as it did when I bought it new.
I would highly recommend him.
Unlike his competition, he didn't try to confuse me with anagrams, or practice any of the typical sales tactics these guys use to get deeper into your wallet.
My TV only needed a cleaning, which he showed me how to perform in the future, and it was well worth the $75.
5-Stars, Alex, thank you!

We had a TV crisis the day before the day before Christmas.
Alex responded within 2 hours of me calling.
Although his quoted rate for normal service was $75...his charge for my emergence WAS STILL $75.00.
He knows his stuff...nice guy...would DEFINITELY use him again.
