This place is FANTASTIC!
They are very professional, TRUSTWORTHY, Go out of their way on their customer service.
It is truly an enjoyable experience to take my business to Paul Lafko and his team everytime.
Thanks Guys!
you're the best!

Not all Midas locations I'd recommend but this one is fantastic!
Very efficient.
Very informative and they always help to give you options when available.
Paul the store manager actually remembered my name and car over the phone when scheduling an appointment.
Who does that now a days?!

After another Midas not opening on time I drove over to this one trying to get my oil change, I was the only customer there.
Manager came in and asked what I needed and said oil change.
He said well that's going to take up to 2 hours all my stalls are full.
I turned around immediately and left.
Midas is not the place for oil change, they hand out these coupons like it's nothing but if and when you actually get to sit around for hours waiting on an oil change they will up sell and up sell and not take no for an answer.
