Just had lunch here and they were sooooo slow.
It's the lunch hour and you have one person working the register and one person putting the food together and working the drive thru(felt bad for this guy) while the other employees were just walking around.
And to top it off it was hot as heck in here it is never fun to sweat and eat.

Don't eat here much anymore.
It seems they are ALWAYS out of one or another items.
Biscuits more than once and twice they were out of CHICKEN!
It's KFC!
How do you run out if chicken!?

Went through the drive thru tonight and didnt receive any of my sides.
Upon returning to the drive thru the girls told me they prolly did give them to me, but she would give me more anyway.
FIRST I ordered 17 dollars worth of food.
Why would I want to get some free mashed potatoes and cole slaw.
SECOND I made it all the way home and wasted my gas to get the order correct.
Way to call your customers liars.
Never going back again!
