Their lunch special is pretty affordable, yet they are not the best Thai food I have ever had.
Not going back to that place ever.
I got the BBQ-pork with sticky rice and papaya salad.
The sticky rice is so not well cooked and I felt like getting grain.
Papaya salad too spicy and doesn't taste too good.
( I requested MILD, and I am a spicy eater)  Overall, not very happy.

Eaten at Thai Pepper a few times.. the thing is it's usually sufficient in that it's fresh dishes are good portions.
The drawback for me is that the flavors are not balanced and sometimes the crispness of items like the tempura shrimp are soggy, and still served hot?
It's confusing for sure.
I've also noticed that the spice level isn't consistent.
Mild is really spicy, medium is really really spicy.. and I'm afraid to try "hot".
This is from a guy that loves pretty spicy food.
My least favorite item that I thought I would love was the ginger chicken.
Really spicy.. but otherwise bland and not a whole lot of chicken.
Lots of veggies, which is nice.. but not allot of meat.
I've been a fan of their wonton soup however, and the crispy veggie eggrolls are good.
Overall, I would prefer the fusion style Thai of places like LeThai on east Fremont.
Happy Eating too you!
