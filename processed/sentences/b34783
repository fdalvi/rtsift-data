Finally a chase opened up in my neighborhood.
Clean, nice bankers, no wait and friendly.

The drive through customer service at Chase Bank in Aliante Parkway is horrible.
BEWARE do not utilize the drive through around 5:00pm they do not acknowledge you and when they do they act as if you are bothering them!
Horrible drive through service.
However, great personal bankers....

When visiting family or working on this side of town I love using this chase.
It is one of the few that has a drive-thru ATM.
The teller told me while I was inside that they are going to slowly be putting drive-thru ATMs at most locations, Score!
I don't have to get out of my car or anything.
They even have a drive-thru for teller assistance if you want to talk to a teller instead of using just the ATM and they are always so nice and quick!
I went inside once last year and the staff was friendly and the bank was clean.
I pretty much use the handy dandy drive-thru ATM.

I love the staff here... very friendly and easy to talk with, and there's never a long wait.
I'm always in and out within minutes.
Never had any issues with them yet and will continue to return here whenever needed.
I try to avoid all the other chase banks around North Las Vegas since some of the staff are rude and not as friendly as this one.

I'm most familiar with the ATM at this location.
It's awesome that their ATMs accept cash and check deposits- makes it so much easier to actually get things done without worrying about trying to make it to the bank during business hours.
As long as you're dealing with the ATM, your visit will likely be pleasant, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this particular location.

Very friendly staff
