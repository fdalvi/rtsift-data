Twice I have been looking all over town for something & ended up here!
They gave me the very best price I could find anywhere on a certain evaporative cooler I was shopping for (ordered & arrived in a few days), & also for a certain type of asphalt cutting saw blades.
These hard-to-find blades were right there in stock at a low price & they performed great on the job here!
Especially for buying a cooler, this is your place.
Friendly & fast service too & yes, they even have lumber!
:-))

Great Lumber store.
I've been working with this company for 20 years

great lumber yard there all very help full and they always have what i need or if its a special order item they will have it on there yard the next morning

A great experience and it was only a small lumber purchase!

I'm a general contractor and I purchase about 80-100k worth of Lumber per year.
And I can say without a doubt that the lumber at heldt lumber company is grossly overpriced.
Home Depot has better quality lumber (if you know how to pic it) that is about 40% cheaper on average .
I chose heldt lumber company because I was under the impression that the wood would be of better quality, boy was I wrong.
Also, if you special order a piece and you notice that it is warped or damaged once you arrive at your work site...too bad for you all sales are final on these items.
I've lost a lot of money and a lot of time dealing with this company, I would strongly advise against shopping there.
