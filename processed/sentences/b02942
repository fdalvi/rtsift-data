My son goes to Karate right next door.
It has been convenient stopping off at this pack and ship place to send things off....unitl last month when I had a prepaid Century Link box ready to be shipped.
All I needed was a piece of tape.
I didn't see any there for it's customers like FedEx and UPS has.
So I set it down on the counter and asked her for a small piece of packing tape (literally 2x"2").
She said "Yes, for 25 cents.
" Okay, this might sound snobby, but I truly thought she was joking.
I said " Really?
" and I smiled.
She said "Yes, 25 cents.
" I replied "Oh wow, you are serious.
25 cents?
" She said "You have to pay for something.
So you can pay for the tape.
"   I gave her the quarter, but she lost my business.
I litereally drive an extra 3 miles to ship my things now.
I want to help this business out, but I don't want to be forced to pay for tape just because the shipment was prepaid.
That was not cool.
