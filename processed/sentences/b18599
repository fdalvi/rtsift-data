My mom and I ate breakfast at this cute restaurant two days in a row.
Both my egg and cheese sandwich and omelette were straightforward, fresh and tasty.
The contents of the omelette were wrapped in egg that was about the thickness of a crepe.
My omelette had bacon in it.
I asked for the bacon to be burned and unlike some other places which  are unwilling to comply, they burned it!
Because of the heat, I was glad to see they weren't trying to go for a gigantic thick and heavy omelette.
The egg and cheese on an English muffin was just that.
They didnt try to sneak in any butter or anything on the bread.
I had an iced hazelnut mocha which was refreshing and also huge!
I had to take most of it to go.

We were in town for the Art and Wine Festival and needed some lunch.
Lousy, fairly expensive food, but pretty good service.
I tried the pulled pork sandwich for $10.95, the pork had too much sauce and it was too sweet.
The bun is just a plain raw bun, not toasted or anything.
Fries and onion rings are fine.
We also tried the burger (also $11) and the sliders.
Lousy burger, it's grey, tasteless cadaver-meat.
Think school cafeteria burger only thicker.
Again, no toasted bun, not ketchup/mustard/mayo.
Just a plain, bland $11 burger.
Someone in our group tried the taco salad and enjoyed it.
Our waitress was nice and kindy offered to let us take our remaining drinks to-go.

The menu is big and looks good from the outside, but when you get the food it is just ok.
I think it's a bit overpriced, too.
The servers are nice, though, and they do a lot of advertising and promoting, so I have to give them props for that.
I prefer the Sundial Cafe - their patio is much better.
Saguaro Grille is MUCH better than Venues, though... at least the servers are prompt, nice, and attentive!
