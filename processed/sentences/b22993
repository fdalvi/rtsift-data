Having been hid away behind the iron walls of a local resort spa (which I won't name since she still works there part-time), aesthetician extraordinaire Maggie G. has broken out on her own.
Her new cozy little skincare studio is tucked in the Las Palomas suites near the Old Town bar scene with easy access to parking.
Maggie is warm, has an incredibly positive energy, and is oh-so focused on bringing out the best in your skin.
I love this woman.
Bonus: visit ArizonaSpaGirls.com for $20 off your first facial with Maggie.
Oh, and bring cash!
She doesn't currently accept credit cards.

Maggie's facials are absolutely incredible.
I travel all over and enjoy world class spas.
The only person I will trust for a facial is Maggie G. She is a miracle worker!
Each facial is custom so she really gives my skin what it needs.
I also buy all my products from Maggie because she chooses the very best and most natural skin care products available.
I can't wait to go back!

Maggie is always finding the best products to bring to her clients and is always going to seminars to continue learning.
I've been extremely pleased with Maggie's facials and on-going skin care and products.
My skin looks tighter, smoother and fresher than before working with Maggie.
Her prices seem fair and she goes above and beyond every time I see her.
