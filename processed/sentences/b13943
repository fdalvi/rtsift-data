As a first time pet owner I've had lots of questions, dumb and not so dumb, as far as the care of our new dog.
Dr. Beyer and all the staff have been wonderful to my husband, myself and of course, our dog Ernie.
They seem to welcome my questions and calls and if I make an appt., it's always very timely.
Plus, Ernie is ALWAYS happy and excited to be there even though he's been poked and prodded, he seems to sense their sincerity and caring.

Dr. Beyer and the South Mountain Vet Clinic staff are the best!
Down-to-earth, honest, and helpful...my dogs receive great care from this clinic.
From nail-cutting to dental cleaning to emergency appointments, they always meet or exceed my expectations.
The doctor refers to specialists when needed and only orders tests she feels are necessary, which I really appreciate.
I highly recommend this clinic!

Love South Mountain Vet Clinic.
I've been taking my shih tzu Bella there ever since I moved to the Valley back in 2008 and have never had any complaints or concerns.
Finding a vet that you're comfortable with and can trust is no easy task, but I definitely found it at South Mountain Vet.
Dr. Beyer has always been helpful, friendly and positive when checking up on my dog, even when she's being fussy and a brat.
Her insight has always been a breathe of fresh air even in the hardest of circumstances.
The staff there has always been friendly and willing to work with my schedule as best as they could.
Not to mention, they are great at sending reminders when vaccinations or any other tests are needed or past due.
I'm so glad I found this place almost 5 years ago now and won't go anywhere else as long as I'm in the Valley.
