Little food for alot of money.
It's definitely good, and I would highly recommend it for a date, but it will hurt your pocketbook.
The ambience is fantastic, a little more conservative than Bar Bianco, but has a similar vibe and reflects the same time frame.
Not for vegitarians, if you're green, don't even try it.

I am still thinking about the gnocci I had at Circa 1900 back in July.
Any dinner that remains deliciously vivid in my memory for four months has got to be worthy of five stars.
I had a great time with one of my good friends.
We were excited to see they used Effen vodka to make their martinis and had a great blackberry cosmo.
I was afraid it would be too fruity for me, but it was fabulous.
I had a fresh tomato salad - perfect for the Arizona summer - and a very light gnocci dish with a delicate broth and mushrooms.
We didn't get a chance to have dessert because we were running to a movie - Another great thing about Circa 1900 is its location.
We were able to walk to the Arizona Center to catch our movie and then rounded out our evening with some ice-cream at Cold Stone.
