Bike cabs beware!
You've got nothing on this rig!
Tour de Tavern is a tribute to tipsy teamwork and a perfect way to host a unique group event.
As "pedalers" on their inaugural tour, we enjoyed the celebrity treatment of cruising down the winding streets of Old Town Scottsdale as onlookers snapped photos and cheered us on!
We rocked out to top 40 hits and, by special request, our Lonely Island favorites on their awesome sound system.
Our guides were flexible and let our party run the show.
If we needed more time for let's say...... an impromptu horseback ride in front of Shotgun Betty's, they were more than happy to wait.
As an added bonus everyone gets to burn off some of those unwanted cocktail calories in between your favorite watering holes.
If you are concerned that after a few stops (and a few shots) your legs might lose some of that forward momentum, there are a few coveted "non pedaling" seats in the back of the bike.
We all compromised with a friendly and fair rotation system.
Our tour guides were helpful, accommodating, and entertaining.
They even proved to be exceedingly patient upon discovering that we did in facts have "that guy" in our group.
If you're saying to yourself,  "Such a marvelous experience could only cost an arm and least the majority of a leg" then you would be wrong!
With the cost of gas being substituted for sheer earth friendly man power, our group of fifteen people spent less than $30 bucks each for the experience.
But wait, there's more!
Included in this price are all the amazing special deals that Tour de Tavern exclusively brings you at select bars along the route.
On our tour we were offered drinks specials ranging from $3 to ONE PENNY!
I say this in all caps because it's ONE PENNY!
So next time you are planning an event, I recommend Tour de Tavern 100%!
"Look Ma!
No hands!

This was AWESOME!!!!
Ultimate way to bar hop.
What I saved on drinks paid for my seat on the bike.
Super nice guys that helped our large group keep moving.
They also traded out with some of the girls and helped pedal after 3 bars.
Definitely not difficult to do since Old Town is pretty flat.
You should try this!
We went with a group that took up the whole bike, but had we gone with total strangers, I'd bet we have been good friends by the end and have had just as good of a time.
loved that we could play our own musice to pedal to.
very unique and fun experience.

My friends rented this bike for a birthday party, and we had a great time bike-hopping through Old Scottsdale.
The best things about this bike are:  -It's a unique experience and the process was exciting throughout -The reaction you get from people on the street (lots of cheering and encouraging) -Working together and getting to travel together as a group to the bars -The sound system (ipod hookup) was great -The lights on the bike add to the allure of it (we did a nighttime ride, and even that was really hot in Phoenix in April) -They have some good coupon deals with the bars you stop at (free shots, coupons for a dollar off drinks, and different drink specials to name a few)  A couple things to be aware of with the bike:  -They have helmets available for wearing, but most people waive it (you're only going 8 mph and unless you're really drunk you shouldn't need it) -You can't drink on the bike bar, because of open container laws.
It's a bummer but doesn't take away from the experience.
-To make the most of your time, the goal is 3-4 bars in the 3 hour window.
Which means you are always on the move, and are always chugging the last few sips of your drink to get going.
Shots might be a more efficient way to go.
:) -Because you are traveling with your own group of 16, every where you go is going to have a line, made up of your own people!
So there is definitely a lot of downtime between drinks.
-Someone in your group needs to keep track of the time and keep everyone moving.
I recommend a cowbell or something so you can round people up easily in the bar to head back to the bike.
-Pedaling the bike can be a lot of work...more than a bike.
There are 12 pedalers, plus you're pulling the extra 4 people in the back, and the driver, and the 3500 pound bike.
Be ready to sweat!
Also shoes with good grips are a good idea (although some girls managed with heels...but maybe that's why pedaling felt like a lot of work for the rest of us).
-The Tour de Tavern owners are really friendly.
Our driver/part-owner was Brendan and he was really fun and made sure we had a good time.
He was a safe driver and handled the bike really well.
I really recommend this bike for anyone that wants to get a group of people together and try a fun new experience!

I purchased this event for a fun neighborhood get together and it was a blast!
Brendan was great to work with and kept us informed on what we needed to know and do and all we had to do was peddle!
We booked our date and then a few days before the event he sent us an update and when we got to the Brat Haus, everything was ready to go.
Brendan joined in the fun and every stop thru Old Scottsdale was a new experience.
The pubs greeted us and the crowds on the streets cheered us on.
We definitely recommend this as it's a fun time for all!

Had an awesome time !!!
Great host, Brandon I think was his name-o :)

Saying this is a blast is an understatement!
We partied our way through town for a birthday party and had such a good time.
It's a safe way to drink and let your hair down.
We arrived by taxi and let the games begin.
The staff was awesome and took care of us every step (or pedal) of the way!

this is def a workout but was so much fun.
my group and i had a blast i'm sure you will see us again very soon :) We also used the yelp deal!!

Kick in the ass, we had a great time recommend it to anybody!
Brendan and Rylee we're fantastic hosts, and took us to some fun bars around town.

A great adventure for friends!
You can't be afraid to pedal, (there really isn't a motor) but it made having drinks at the bar even sweeter!
Highly recommended!

Best way to get around Scottsdale!!
Went out on a Bday party with friends and had a blast.
It's fun seeing everyone stare and point as you pedal through town while jamming out.
The hosts were great.
Drink specials were huge.
Gonna do this again when my bday roles around in April!!

Fun times!
Had a great day!
Took us to all the great bars!
Can't wait to do it again

This was so fun.
Brenden was great about keeping time for us.
The bike was more work than I expected but it was still a really great time.
We went for a friends birthday and I would absolutely book again!
If you're on the fence, do it!

It's my birthday, so I'm a bit critical, but these guys were amazeballs!!!!
Drinking with a workout?!!??
Every Scottsdales girls dream

It doesn't get any more fun than this.
Just a real hoot!
Riley and Brendan, the operators, are gems.
Very flexible, personable and eager to show everyone a good time and they do.
We have done the tour 3 times and will do it again.
It's a wonderful thing to do with out of town guests.

I've taken this for two birthdays (the first was their first ride ever) and it is soooo much fun!
Not only do you get a good work out (pedal pedal pedal) but they take you to some fun bars that give you good deals (aka Dos, giligins, lodge, etc).
Plus, tourists love this- you'll be waving as much as your pedaling!
Great for a birthday, a day of dAyDrinking, or whatever else kind of celebration!
Picks up at Brat Haus which is also delicious!
Five stars fo sho

Exercise.
Fun.
Deals in drinks?
Get it all with this.
Such a great experience riding with these guys!!
Friendly and fun service.

Would definitely work with them again, and very soon!

Best time with great people the staff was awesome and very nice and very down to earth.
I will definitey book again and show everyone tour de tavern .its like bar hopping without driving

Tour de tavern is the best birthday gift I could have given my husband!
The best experience ever!
He loved it sooooo much!
I am guilty of spoiling my husband on his birthday with awesome parties and this year was no exception!
He loves biking and drinking so this was a no brainer!
Brendan was the vision of professionalism along with being personable and I felt comfortable throwing any questions that came to mind.
I set up a 2 hour tour with 16 of us and everything went perfectly.
I set up a surprise at Brat Haus around noon that way everyone would be there by 1:30, leaving time for everyone to eat and secretly sign their waivers before our 2:00pm scheduled tour.
I had Eric thinking the lunch at Brat haus was the big event, so when I surprised him with Tour de Tavern he was ecstatic!!
Brendan and his team were kind enough to put up a banner (1ftX5ft) that I had printed out for him, it fit wonderfully.
We had a blast with 14 of our closest friends and family pedaling across old town.
Everyone had a great time at the 3 bars that were suggested with the best drink discounts from the tour- dos gringos, Gillian's and coach house.
We blasted our iPod and they are kind enough to provide cold water for everyone.
When you're going through alleys you can switch up peddlers by running around a couple of times almost like musical chairs-- super fun!
I was worried 2 hours wouldn't be enough time but it was plenty!
I recommend Tour de Tavern, and I am so happy with the experience and service!
Thanks for making my husband birthday unforgettable!

Tool Much Fun!!!
Brendan is a blast... Great crew!!!!
