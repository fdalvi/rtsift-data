George and David are wonderful.
They keep things very low on the s Eng and chemical scales so if you are sensitive this is the place to go.
Love getting my hair cut and styled there with David and my facials with George.

You can get yourself pampered from head to toe.
They do everything from facials, makeup, manicures, pedicures, massages even hair extensions!
Salon Georvid offers a very professional & peaceful experience.

Such an amazing place to get your self back in tune from head to toe!!!
David always does a fantastic job on my hair and the pedicure was so relaxing feels like walking on air.
Top it off a body scrub by George with reflexology CLOUD 9!
And even get rid of some unwanted hair.
One stop shopping thanks guys!

Let me preface this post with this: I have never had a salon service before and I'm a bit of a rough around the edges Wisconsin boy... with that said,  MY EXPERIENCE WAS AMAZING!
I met George a week ago or so and he mentioned that I needed to try a facial so I took his word for it and set an appointment.
I didn't know what to expect but it was awesome!
To me it was more comfortable & relaxing than getting a massage.
The room is set up to be peaceful and serene.
My face feels like it can breathe again and it was a great way to stay my morning!
Highly recommend these guys!
