Best authentic Mexican food we have found since moving to AZ in 5 years.
Menudo 7 days a week.
And I hate menudo Mexico but will eat theirs.

This is probably the closest place I have near me if I am craving some mexican food.
I usually get the adobada burrito.
Its really good and the staff is good too.
I never had a complaint there at all.
They are open most of the time too, sometimes even 24 hours.
So, if you looking for something decent or craving a late night mexican meal you can't go wrong with this place.

We were looking for "hole in the wall Mexican" and yelp led us here.
We ate in.
Food was out and on our table within 3 minutes (no exaggeration).
Food was delicious... Tacos were a bit greasy
