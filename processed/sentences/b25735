This is an excellent small bank that treats their customers with respect.
My branch is Bell Rd and 7th St.
They are all friendly and you can even talk to a real person if you call the branch, no automated mess to try to navigate through.
Highly recommended.
I moved all my accounts from Bank of America to Midfirst and have been very pleased with the difference in service.

The customer service at this branch is phenomenal.
My husband I are always treated exceptionally well.
It is a lot of small touches that make this bank a standout.
The staff is personable, the atmosphere inviting and a complimentary water and coin machine are an added bonus.
Even the safe deposit box area feels better than most banks.
I would highly recommend this particular branch of Midfirst Bank!

Not your typical financial organization they treat customers as other financial institution should.
Recently switched my accounts over here from a larger institutions by the recommendation of another Nelson Lozano went above and beyond to help my wife and I get our business straight there .
It's great when you walk into someplace you may have only been a few times and then remember your name without looking at the computer we finally found a home bank
