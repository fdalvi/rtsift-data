I wouldn't be writing about this if I didn't notice that 90% of Panda Expresses do this:  1 employee ratio per 10 customers = a disaster waiting to happen.
Please Please Please employ more people.
It is not cool to wait 15 minutes to order, especially when it's fast food.
I feel bad for the 1 employee that is supposed to get/make food and ring up 10 customers all at once.
By himself.
1 person handling the drive thru alone is just cruel.

I always want to like Panda Express.
They're friendly, nice establishment, conveniently located- but the food always leaves me disappointed

This is your typical Panda Express; the food is predictably good - the same predictable food you will get at any other Panda Express.
Nothing to write home to mom about; but so much healthier than the typical fast-food joint.

Typical panda.
All the food looks so amazing and then you get it home and its just Eh.
Could do worse with a quick meal, but I always leave feeling so dissatisfied with the food.
Service was quick and friendly, so no complaints at all with staff.
But unfortunately service is only part of the picture, and pushing $10 for lunch I have higher expectations.

Fried rice should be called twice fried as it was hours old and re-cooked at least once had two different colors to it and mushy .
The Orange chicken tasted watered down or I should say no taste to it.
I have eaten Panda a hundred times will NEVER eat at this one again.
