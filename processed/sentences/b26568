Staff is super friendly and the tablet you fill in your info on in the foyer instead of a stack of papers to fill out by hand.
The doctor had a corny sense of humor (like my dad) and he was inviting, knowledgable, and very sure of himself.

It took us over a month to get blood work results even though my wife called several times and we were even at the doctors office in between this time frame.
I had a 24 heart monitor I had to wear and it took almost 3 weeks to get the results for that as well.
I went in for heart palpitations.
You would think there might be some urgency about response.
When I went in to talk to the doctor a month and a half after all of the initial assessments, he lackadaisically apologized for the delayed response.
I called him on it, and he just laughed and ignored me.
I waited a month and a half to be referred to someone else.
I have already found another doctor and will never go back to this doctor!

BEWARE!!
You do not want to see this doctor.
He is ONLY in the health care industry in order to over bill insurance companies.
I was referred to this practitioner and when I checked his credentials I didn't find any board actions.
I called to make an appointment and let his office know that I was a cash patient with no insurance and was looking for a specific type of doctor.
I was never told that he does not write refills, but rather forces his patients to come into his office every month, which for a cash patient is initially $220 and then $150 every subsequent  month.
He charges ridiculous fees too.
He charges a $25 fee if you are more than SEVEN (7) minutes late to appointment and then they cancel the appointment and make you reschedule.
This while I waited in his waiting room for almost 2 hours before I was taken back to a room and then waited another 30 minutes.
They also charge a $50 fee to fill out paperwork that may be required by an insurance company, if it's more than 2 pages long!!
Another Yelper wrote that she liked the tablet computers you use to do your paperwork on, but she perhaps didn't notice the additional fees they charge you to have digital paperwork/files.
He refused to help me with the initial cost of the visit and told me he NEVER works with his patients if they cannot afford to see him.
Apparently they would prefer to lose patients rather than help them out.
Also when I called to make an initial appointment I was never told the doctor does not confer with other doctors, such as your prior doctor, and never writes refills.
He also refuses to give patients additional medication if they run out over a weekend and can't get in to see him before they run out.
Had I known about all this beforehand I would never have made an initial appointment.
When I told that to the girl on the phone, she insisted that only two people make these types of appointments and they always tell the patients this.
NOT!!
Save yourself some serious hassles and stay away from this guy!!
I've never seen a provider that refused to help out his patients monetarily if they are in a bind and really need help.
I've never seen a provider that refused to speak with my old doctor in order to get additional information about me.
And I've never seen a provider that refused to write refills and forced his patients to see him every month instead.
Seriously, who does this?
Oh yeah, Dr. Allen does!!
Not to mention that not more than two (2) weeks after seeing this doctor I got very sick and found out I had gallstones and needed to have my gallbladder removed, but for some reason Dr. Allen MISSED this diagnosis.
Hmmmm..not surprised.

I have been going to this office for a few years and got Dr. Manley who I love, I was told he is retiring so it will only be Dr. Allen.
Don't bother the review from Jill L is 100% correct.
I called for a refill 3 days in advance, went to pick up prescription to find that the refill was denied and I need to come in for a follow up.
They did not call to tell me this and are refusing to give me a refill to get me to my appointment in four days.
Stopping my medication will have negative effects on my health but all they care about is billing the insurance for the office visit.
I could understand if I was a patient that hadn't been in for 8 months or something but I was just in a month ago.
I cannot see any reason to treat an existing patient this way.
Basically they are going to force me to be ill for several days until the office visit when they will refill my medication.
DR ALLEN DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU AS A PERSON HE CARES ABOUT THE MONEY HE CAN BILL YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY FOR!!

This office seems completely set on taking insurance companies for all their worth as well as nickel and diming their patients.
From having to book an appointment every time you need a prescription refill (which is outrageous) to expensive "random" urine test which happen nearly every time for me, this place is ridiculous.
I am done with this place.
Dr. Manley is good and would do well to get his own office but the admin staff is incompetent and Dr. Allen seems more concerned about his bank account than his patients.
Stay away.
Do not go here.
Here is my final experience.
This has been my doctor office for over a year.
I went to Dr. Manley each time.
My last visit, I made an appointment to see Dr. Manley.
Upon entering I was told that I owed a past due $25 copay from my last visit to which I told them I didn't have a last visit I only did blood work (which was supposed to be no charge) and I saw a tech to perform an ultrasound.
They said I needed to pay Dr. Allen a co-pay for seeing the tech for the ultrasound although they said I didn't need to pay anything when I came in on that previous visit.
That didn't make sense.
Already irritated I just paid it so I could see Dr. Manley and get my blood work and ultrasound results.
When I finally get to see the doctor, Dr. Allen walks in, not Dr. Manley who I've been seen for over a year.
He rushes in grabs my test results and proceeds to mumble through them talking quickly and skimming through the paperwork like he is scanning through a newspaper.
Every time I attempted to speak he seemed to want to talk over me and just do his thing.
He continued asking me some questions which Dr. Manley clearly new the answers and were on my record, but he didn't even care to look at that.
It seemed like I was being herded through and the doctor was trying to break a record for worlds quickest doctor visit.
When he finished his rant I got a question in asking about a set of blood test I took.
He told me he didn't have any results for that test but don't worry since is usually negative anyway.
I told him I wanted the result and he said he can see that Dr. Manley ordered it but he didn't have any results.
My insurance was charged for this test.
They told me they would call me back and follow up on it.
A few days later I get a call but not too clear up the blood results but to attempt to book me for a visit so I could rent a machine for a take home test.
I was told I needed to pick up the device and take it home but needed to be booked for a visit.
At this time asked what happened to my blood test.
The girl on the phone stuttered and says she has no information on that and needed to get back to me.
They never did.
At this point I knew I was done with this office and their incompetent office staff.
To make things even worse a few weeks later I get a $400 dollar bill in the mail for the ultrasound they performed.
Now when I was told I needed to do the ultrasound I was told they needed to get PRE-APPROVAL from my insurance.
Before taking the test they told me my insurance WOULD cover it.
This irritated me to know end because now I felt lied too.
Upon contacting my insurance I was told it was an issue with the way the doctor office coded the paperwork.
I called the "billing" department listed on the bill Dr. Allen's office sent me but no one ever answers, always goes to a voice message.
I left a message stating my issue and said I needed a call back.
Guess what they never called me back.
Do yourself a favor and save a lot of money and headaches, do not go here.

I have noticed a significant change in the way I am treated in this office from when I started going approximately 7 years ago.
I recently had the final straw when I didn't get a prescription filled in time because I was not aware there was a time limit due to the nature of the prescription.
I called the office to see if they could re-write the prescription, explaining I was unaware that I had to fill it immediately and that if necessary I could return the original prescription to prove I wasn't trying to just get more pills.
In fact a bottle of 60 pills last me approximately 9 months!
I was told, sorry, policy, we can't do that, we tell everyone they need to get it filled right away.
I said, no, I assure you Allison Barto did not explain that to me when she handed me the prescription or I would have done so.
Basically the response I got was silence.
No offer to see if there was anything that could be done, nothing, nada, zip you are out of luck.
Just you need to come back and pay another co-payment to get it.
Prior to this I was left in the waiting area for almost an hour.
When I inquired as to when I would be seen as there had been multiple people who came in after me see the doctor AND leave, they said when did you get here?
Uh, an hour ago as is clearly written right here on your little log in sheet next to my printed name.
So finally I get to the back and received no apology from Dr. Allen which indicates to me that the staff didn't even care enough to let him know what had happened.
If any of my employees had made an error of this nature I would certainly expect them to let me know so that I could make a personal apology myself.
Recently I decided to make an appointment for an allergy test.
I was informed that once they confirmed that my insurance would cover they would call me to make an appointment.
I waited a week and hadn't heard a thing, well when I called back they said they were waiting for me to call them back?!
Seriously?
I inquired if they had even contacted my insurance and that was no, we need to do that and then we will call you.
They actually did follow through that time.
I also received a bill from them a few months back that I had paid while in the office.
After multiple calls I finally received someone who could help me.
Surprisingly the woman in the billing was really nice!
She apologized for the error and said she would correct the payment as soon as possible.
I actually do not have any qualms with Dr. Allen but the treatment I have received from the office staff is just deplorable.
I am in the process of searching for another doctor as I will not return to this practice.
If I could rate the office less than 1 star I would.
I just called to inquire about my medical records and the process to get them to a new doctor.
No inquiry about where or why I was going, I honestly didn't think she cared, so just proves to me that I am making the right decision to leave.

Over the last year the office has been getting REALLY shady.
I'm talking "random" drug tests EVERY TIME you come in for a perscription refill!
Then they charge your insurance $400 for the drug test!
They code the bill to suck the most out of your insurance that they can!
Also, last time I went there, I made a stink about the drug test and about how it charged my insurance so much.
The girl took me into a back room away from listening ears in the reception area and told me I could just pay $20 on top for my co-pay and if the results come back negative, they will just through away the results.
I went down the street and found a better doctor.
You should too!

Excellent doctor.
Helpful staff.
No problem with refills.

Glad to know I'm not the only person that feels this way about this place.
Honestly, this place is a sad excuse for a medical facility.
I made my first appointment about 7 months ago.
Just a routine check up and I was looking to establish an primary care doctor.
So I go into the appointment and I waited almost an hour.
First red flag.
I see the doctor and it goes well.
Dr. Allen seems like a good doctor.
( I realize now he only cares how fat his wallet is) They tell me I have to do a drug test.
Uhhh...
Okay.
I do one.
I don't think much of it.
He wants labs on me, which is normal.
They have an in-house lab that can take blood samples.
I asked 3 times if my insurance covered that.
I was told yes and not to worry about it.
I do my labs and leave.
Pretty straight forward and at this point I was happy with the experience.
I get a call a week later saying I need to come back in to see the doctor.
I'm told it has to do with my labs.
They REFUSED to tell me over the phone.
So I make an appointment and pay another stupid co-pay.
One of my lab values was slightly off.
When I say slightly I mean if 9.0 was normal I was at 9.2.
Dr Allen orders 2 different breathing tests.
Which came back normal.
Duh!
I leave and go about my day.
2 weeks later I received the most outrageous bills for not only the breathing tests but the blood tests.
This office charged me almost $2,000 for blood work.
Thanks to this place I'm in debt and have no way of repaying that much money.
Fast toward to now.
I needed to see a doctor.
I called and tried to make an appointment and was DENIED because I owe them money.
Money that I was told wasnt going to be owed because it was covered by my insurance.
So much for patient care.
This place is horrible and only cares about the dollars in your pocket.
You have been warned.

wait time 2 hrs to c dr.....still waiting for my blood test results after a month or so ....nobody called....... if u need a real dr office look somewhere else
