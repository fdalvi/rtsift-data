This place has good pickings.
A little more expensive than St Vincent Depaul's, but the stuff tends to be nicer.
They've got the main staples of a thrift store: a fair amount of glasswares and kitchen garb along with a modest furniture selection.
Clothes can be found in the back.

I thought this was a thrift shop?
Well, I gagged at their prices...no thanks and no way.

The staff is super friendly but the prices are RIDICULOUS!
I was thinking; "this crap didn't cost this much when it was new!!

Wow, the 5 women in this place are hardcore tweakers...  And yeah what's with the insane prices

I went by here yesterday,  4/29/14.
It was empty & for sale.
