I have build over 6 homes in the last 25 years.
VIP is the best.
Craftsmanship beyond anything I have experienced in the past.

VIP homes has been nothing but stressful and not fulfilling contractual obligations with a good friend of mine.
They have a special needs child and VIP insists on pavers and a heavy front door (that weren't required when contract was written) these things will inhibit his every day activities and help them if there is a fire and he can't open the door.
In addition now that the market value has increased VIP is using these items to increase the price of the home so it's possible the buyers can't qualify.
VIP would love this so that way they can turn around and sell the home to another buyer for 25% more ($150k).
Buyers beware of VIP Homes in AZ!
