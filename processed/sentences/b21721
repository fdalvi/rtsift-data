This place is way cool.
They got hot waitresses to bring you drinks.
Sometimes they haggle you for drink tickets but it is never a problem for me.
I like the parlay cards they have and I head here for that particular reason.
The people here are way cool.
There are many locals that come here.
I have gotten some good leads here in the past.
They were telling me about Nevada Reno and San Jose St. Football.
I guess they did their research and it turned out good for me.
I had some entertaining conversations here and met some good people here.
I do win here more frequently than anywhere else.
I do get into arguments often but that at this joint.
If you get hungry there is a Panda Express, McDonald's, pizza, a Coffee Bean and many other food options nearby.
No reason to not give this place a try.
Sometimes they give out gifts like a commuter mug and some other stuff if you have a member card.
They used to not take bets on the NBA but I think that has changed now.

HUGE projection screens.
If you are betting they have cubicles with what looked like computer screens available there (to possibly make more bets?
) to sit in.
I liked the fact that these huge screens were there for patrons gambling or passing by to also watch the games.
I stood outside the sportsbook and was able to post up and eat a donut and drink a coffee while watching the world cup games.
This sportsbook probably has the best screens to watch any major sporting event going on.
