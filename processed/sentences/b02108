The owner was in the store when i stopped by and was very accommodating.

3/4/2014 -- I had 2 boxes shipped with UPS.
Upon knowing they were signature required.
I notifed UPS and redirected them to the UPS store 2 miles from my house.
I paid UPS $24.10 to do this.
Normally I use FedEx Ground and there is no charge to do the redirect hold at a store.
I paid the $24.10.
I went to the UPS store, and the person there Kay Bani, said, yes packages are here, great.
She then comes back and says, there is a $10/fee per box (I had two boxes) for a "hold fee".
UPS never made any mention of any "fee".
Since they said "we signed for them" and held them, (for what 1 hour or so), that there is a "fee" to release them.
I had no choice but to pay the ransom for my 2 boxes.
Thus far, UPS has not returned any call backs.
Unless I paid "their" fee, I was not getting my packages.
So I feel, this charge is not appropriate, as I was never told of any "fee".
The UPS Store has been uncooperative and will not return phone calls or refund this "fee".
Be warned these people are not friendly, not customer oriented either.
You have been warned.
Be smart, use FEDEX, FEDEX GROUND.
THESE SERVICES ARE FREE.
NO FEE.

Always have nice friendly service when I'm in here.
Not only do they do UPS but US Mail as well.

This UPS location prominently advertises its printing services.
Upon printing a shipping label, I was inexplicably charged $2.50 because the file was on a thumb drive, requiring the employee to spend an extra 20 seconds to retrieve it.
No mention was made of this absurd charge prior to printing.
I'll give it a solitary star, because it is conveniently located.
