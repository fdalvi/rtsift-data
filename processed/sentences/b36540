Pool guys appear to be a dime a dozen in the Valley.
I've used a handful over the years and I thought they were all ok, but not professional at all.
Diamondback Pools is like having your "Pool Guy" backed by a real company.
They actually leave you messages when they service you.
Was that so hard?
And they don't have to sub out repairs to other companies that also suck.
Plus you don't have strangers walking though your property.
Diamondback Pools is great.

My pool had a problem with the plumbing.
I contacted 4 places.
One didn't service this area, two didn't bother even calling back and then there was Diamondback pools.
Tom came out the same day after his scheduled work.
He even dragged his delightful wife along since we lived between her work and their home.
He diagnosed the problem and ordered the parts.
We were up and running two days later and it is very important to run the equipment in Arizona in June.
Well Done.
A week later, the two that didn't call still haven't been heard from.

This is my first time owning a pool and we decided to hire a pool company to do the routine service required since I am clueless.
I am THRILLED with Diamondback Pools level of service.
Tom called me on Tuesday and we scheduled an inspection and cleaning for Friday.
He was prompt and verypatient/ helpful in explaining what was going to be required to maintain the pool.
We have setup for Diamondback to pop out weekly to help us with the routine maintenance.
Thank you Tom!
