It's not the end-all, be-all of awful...but it's sub-par.
Perhaps it's just the experiences I've had there (experiences unrelated to the bar itself) that make the bile rise in my throat when its name is mentioned.
In any case, it's a wood-paneled, dank bar with green and yellow Green Bay Packers curtains.
Do you really need to know any more about it?

I go here because its near home, and is very affordable, a round of drinks for my wife an I can be less than 5$ if we order a beer and a call drink which is crazy for madison.
Its very rarely busy so we never have to wait for service, but you do have to deal with some of the regular joes who think its hilarious to call women "sweet cheeks" and force shots of Cherry Doctor on people (10 years ago your manhood would be questioned if you ordered something like that, but now apparently its okay for even the most hardened construction can order it and no one blinks).
On the plus side you probably won't get stabbed here like some of the other bars in the neighborhood.

Late night Madison is tough when you are hungry.
I saw that this dive bar was packed the night before so we stopped in on a Sunday evening.
The few patrons in the bar were playing metal at full volume.
We all had the Packer Burger which was a big MEH.
Not the worst place I have ever been but I have been to some dumps.
I would not seek the Packer Inn out in the future.

Old packer is now chiefs tavern.
Cleaned up remodeled.great food and beer!
Very clean.
