I have been a long time customer of Walter Porters of Artistic FX.
He does a great job on my hair.
He is an awesome colorist.
My hair has been many colors over the years and he makes it look sooo good!
Walter always keeps me up to date with a great cut and color that compliments me.
His salon is #16 inside Salon Boutique at the corner of 57th ave and Bell.

Brand new client of Walter's and I'm not going to say a word.....here or to anyone!
I don't want it any harder than it already is to get in.
But the man is a goofy hair god!

Hard worker..always available and pays amazing attention to detail:)
