Aroma Cafe is the only cafe in KW that roasts their coffee daily, so you know it's always a fresh roast.
They are also the only place I know of that sells the raw coffee for home-roasters.
Great atmostphere if you want to sit in, but also decent prices if you roast at home.
Decent prices for green coffee, but not a huge selection of origins.

By far the best coffee to be found in Waterloo.
Coffee is freshly roasted on the premises.
Where else can you get coffee served to you in a Bodum?
Their Lattes are fantastic... not too milky and watered down like the big boys.
You still get a little mud in yer cup!
Their beans are great to take home and brew... mmmm Sumatra.
BTW.. they have a lot of gluten free items on their menu.

This is a very cute cafe located in a charming British style building in uptown Waterloo.
The prices for drinks are quite reasonable and the food menu has an attractive array of sandwiches and even some Korean dishes like bibimbap.
It seems like they have a whole range of coffee.
Their iced cappuccino is delicious.
They also have a lot of gluten free options.
I got a hazelnut torte that was a bit disappointing because the cake was good but the frosting was too buttery and overwhelming.
The service was very friendly.
