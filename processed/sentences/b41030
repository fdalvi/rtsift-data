Lovely little spot to get some good eats!
As the name implies, all of the items are packed and ready to take away, however there is also a small bar with a few stools if you'd like to eat in or sip on a coffee right there.
The menu has different features appearing on a weekly basis and this week the quinoa salad was delectable.
I'm definitely going back again very soon.

If you're looking for a quick but good sandwich or salad, then this is the place.
A little pricier than other downtown options, but worth it for the better quality.
The staff seemed nice though I only talk with them for a couple of minutes (probably 2 min more than most customers).
Newly opened, so ambience is a little spartan.
Grab something and head out again, don't plan on eating there.

yummy yummy awesome healthy and fresh foods, gotta try it, we love the different salads and the sandwiches are superb
