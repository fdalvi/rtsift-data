BTH has some nice panini sandwiches.
The guys at the shop turned me on to it and we frequent BTH at least twice a month.
They have the "Lunch Box" which consist of a sandwich, of your choice, a bag of chips, drink and a homemade cookie.
Big Town Hero gets thumbs up!

They have delicious vegetarian sandwiches.
way better than subways or heidi's.

I'm from Oregon so I was VERY glad to see a BTH here in Vegas.
I stopped on Mondays after my flight landed each week.
Sadly, I found this week when I went to stop by for my normal Monday fare, they are closed and the space is empty.
The owner over at Sunrise Coffee told me that they decided not to continue their lease and were now out.
Now what to do about lunch on Monday...
