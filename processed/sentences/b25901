Went in for MRI.
Tech was abrupt/rude ti me when I said I did not want to leave my ID up front unattended.
(Have been an ID theft victim in the past.
)  Would have been a 4 star without... would have been a 1 but the tech did eventually apologize.
Not my usual experience, but felt disrespected and disregarded... a little more time and consideration, 10 secs more and an acknowledgement of my concerns would have made all the difference.

I called to make an appointment for an x ray and was told to walk in.
I waited for over an hour before I was seen.
Are you freaking kidding me?
That was the whole point of my call.
I will never go here again.

It's odd.
I've had the exact same experience at two different locations.
Both times, I've had an appointment.
Both times, they were running considerably behind and I waited an hour past my appointment time.
And both times, the techs were extremely personable and apologetic about the wait time.
I get that emergencies happen (which apparently is why they were running so late).
But I have things to do too and making me wait an hour past my appointment time makes me an unhappy camper.
The solution seems easy.
Call the people with appointments.
Let me know you're running late and by how much.
Give me the option to get other things done OR at the very least, prepare for a long wait.
This doesn't seem hard.
What am I missing?
