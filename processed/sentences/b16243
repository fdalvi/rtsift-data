If you like shrimp dishes, this place could be for you.
They have a plethora of shrimp dishes.
We had a ceviche dish and a shrimp fajita dish.
Both were definitely tasty.
Overall, not an especially fantastic dining experience, but the food is okay.

Yummy.
Take a trip south of the border.
Love this place more everytime I eat here.
I love the shrimp cocktail.
Fajitas are fabulous and the quesidilla is divine.
This is my favorite Mexican seafood in town!!
Far and kind of pricey, but worth it

Delicious food.
My friend and I were actually waiting at Las Islitas, but because it was a fight weekend AND Mexican Independance Day we couldn't hold our appetite any longer.
Someone had mentioned El Diamante to us so we figured we would try this place out.
We called to see if they were busy, which they said they were but said they would set up a table for two.
This place was not as busy as Las Islitas, but that was good for us.
They have mariachi bands as well.
Now if you are not used to mariachi bands playing while you eat, you might want to bring earplugs.
Not saying that they are bad, but it is REALLY loud.
Not a place to have intimate conversations, this setting is to eat and drink and enjoy the mariachi band(s).
Food wise, we had the appetizer oyster topped with ceviche, omg that was so tasty.
Their seafood dishes, you cannot go wrong.
I actually had a beef dish to mix it up a little as my main dish, but I can't recall what exactly it was called.
Its a really long name that started with a Z...haha I hope that helps but that was yum.
They serve it with 4 tortillas.
2 with Cheese the other with beans.
It was delicious and spicy and I emphasize SPICY.
I highly recommend.
My friend spoke fluent in Spanish and that did help a lot.
Makes the conversation with the staff easier.
Their food is yummy and I will definitely return for more.
I just would feel comfortable bringing a Spanish speaking person with me, LOL

This joint is close to work HQ and surprised I didn't come here sooner.
It's a great authentic Mexican restaurant known for their mariscos.
Still, I find it awkward to elaborate about places that are from different cultures.
I find it hard to refrain from rolling my eyes and SMH when heads provide their rendition of their review of other cultures without knowing the real deal, so if I become a hypocrite in this review, feel free to call me out on it...lol.
After a long trek through the Broad Acres Swap Meet in North Las Vegas, we figured we may as well keep it real and conclude the adventure with some good Mexican grub.
Our menu consisted of white fish ceviche de oescado, carne zarandeade, pulpitos a la mantequilla, botana mixta, cerveza preparada and horchata, all of which made me excited and added to the suspense.
I was told that there is a live mariachi band, but none in sight when we arrived.
It can get pretty sporty and didn't know how I felt about not hearing myself chew today, so okay with the blasting Mexican music.
But I spoke too soon, in came the band and jammed at a table till we departed.
Soon afterward a dude came by suited and booted selling chocolate bars followed by a guy slangin rosaries.
The place is pretty authentic in my book.
Sometimes I feel that the great finds not always have the highest Yelp review, but less in this case and is a diamond in the rough.
The michiladas were on point and splashed with fish juice even, now if that ain't authentic, I dint know what is.
I have to give the overall experience a 4 since its just what the doctor ordered...a great day at the Mexican swap meet followed by some good Mexican food.
I hope that my follow up visits will be just as entertaining.
Next time, I plan to have the pescado zarandeade and will provide you all with the scoops on that.

I had a michelada and tostada de ceviche.
A little too much lemon on the ceviche for my taste but still good.. Michelada was tasty but I'm still looking for my favorite in town.
They had live music so that was pretty awesome!
Oh and a little too pricey.

The outside looks as if the restaurant is closed so we were a little skeptical until we saw someone go in.
I came with a group of people on a Friday.
We had done some drinking the night before.
I ordered a michelada.
It was a bit temperature hot so i had to order a cup of ice to put some in.
They had salsa and tostadas as starters.
The salsa was very good especially if you add lemon.
For my entree i ordered " El ceviche de camaron casero" which is basically ceviche de agua chiles.
This was so good and the plate was really big.
I shared it with everyone.
I also had some of my bf's regular shrimp ceviche.
This was also really good.
A person we were with shared one of his shrimp empenada.
this was really good and the sauce it came with was really spicy but delicious.
The service here was also really great.
The waitress was really nice and attentive.
She kept coming around to ask if we were doing ok. She did a really great job considering our party consisted of about 15 people.
The decor is very nice too.
Its full of really comfortable chairs made in Mexico named EQUIPALES.
Next time I'm in Vegas i will definetely be coming to El Diamante.

Worst service ever!
Let me clarify something, I am Mexican and I know Mexican food.
Having said that, I came here for dinner and ordered a Mix Seafood Tostadas.
What did I get?
Tostadas with no seafood full of fake imitation crab.
I brought it to the attention of the manager who stated that its how they make the tostadas here.
Really?
Maybe they were having a bad day, but even so they deserve a bad review.

I had been to this place one time before my recent and LAST visit to this place.
The first time around everything went smooth, the food was great, the service was great, no complaints.
The second time around, it was a completely different experience.
Let me start by saying ABSOLUTELY WORST SERVICE EVER.
We walked in and the place was busy.
When my boyfriend and I walked in we made eye contact with a waitress, who rather than sitting us down went about her business as if we were not there.
Rude much?
We get seated and we ordered our food.
I ordered a small order or ceviche and my boyfriend order two empanadas and a tostada mixta.
The ceviche was good, but it was missing avocado.
Every other restaurant that I have gone to and ordered ceviche serves avocado with it.
So I asked the waitress if I could please have some avocado.
A HALF HOUR LATER I get my avocado, a whole avocado, by this time I am practically done with the ceviche!!
The empanadas were fairly good, not the best.
My boyfriend's tostada, wow I do not even know where to start!
To begin with there was ONE shrimp on it placed neatly on the top of a mountain of haiva which is crab imitation.
We dig through the pile of haiva only to find two pieces of octopus which did not look appetizing AT ALL.
On the bottom of it all is what seems to be a tomato sauce.
When I tell my waitress that I did not order a tostada de haiva and that I ordered a tostada mixta she simply told me that she was sorry but that it was not her fault that she did not cook that.
She does not even offer to take it up to her supervisor or to return the food, NOTHING!
At any other restaurant the least they do is ask if we want the food returned or replaced.
Then I look for a waiter and tell him about the issue, and just like the waitress, he does nothing but explain that it is the way they make them there.
Absolutely ridiculous, anyone can google a tostada mixta and you will see that nothing looks like a mountain of haiva.
WORSTE EXPERIENCE EVER!!!

I love the food but service is the worst !
Had to wait for them to clean the table ..there was 6 tables dirty no where to sit .
Waitress took another 15 minutes to bring menus.
The food was good ...we waited to get the bill after asking waitress 20 minutes!
I finally walked up to the cashier and asked is the food free because I been waiting for 20 minutes...at no point did they apologize ..paid the bill waitress got $0 tip and that was very hard for me to do...if I decided to go again and this happens I will walk out without paying

This place is okay... Definitely horrible service.
We walked in & seated ourselves.
Took about 10 minutes to get acknowledged by the waitress, then about another 10 minutes to get the drinks.
Finally she took our order and the food was out in a reasonable amount of time.
We ordered the shrimp cocktail & the aguachiles.
The aguachiles was good, however this place is pretty expensive.
I'm not sure what the market prices are for shrimp, but this place is no bargain.
I will say their preparadas (beer with a combination of some shrimp juice) were 5 stars.
Really tasty.
Perhaps I'll return, but if I don't it won't be the end of the world.

Went to lunch.
No lunch specials.
Device so-so.
The shrimp cocktail was horrible.
No flavor.
Shrimp were not deveined and tasted old.
The music was blasting for the liking of the servers and not the customers.
The lemon fish was not good.
I would fire the cook and focus on the customers.
There is much better around the area.

This is one of the best mexican seafood restaurant.
The outside is a little ghetto but once inside it is very nice and all the food and drinks are on point.
The best in my opinion.

I am just rating on the vibe of this place.
I came here a week ago to accompany my parents for their early dinner.
It was my first time coming in here and I must say that I loved the atmosphere.
The decorations and the vibrant colors this place has to offer are just energetic.
The music is just about right noise wise; we were all able to talk without having to yell at each other.
& most importantly, the place was full.
By the time we left there was a line forming.
I would like to come here again and try their food because my parents have raved about it so it must be good.
