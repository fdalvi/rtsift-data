At last!
A place that sells bananas after they've turned ripe!
You know, I can't stand under-ripe bananas.
They taste like cardboard.
In fact, an under-ripe banana ruins my day.
Not only do fruit-a-licious sell ripe bananas, but they sell them cheaper than under-ripe ones.
Imagine that!
I got one today for 7p.
Amazing.
Enough about bananas, this place is brilliant for all veg.
They have about 7 different types of potato, loads of different mushrooms, chillis, various herbs, loads of fruit (including bananas).
They also sell specialist Indian spices and delicacies (and who doesn't love a good samosa).
This place has been a real find.
The produce is good quality and so so cheap.
I'll not be venturing into Tesco again to get my fruit and veg.
I've found my new veg shop, even if the name is a bit dodgy.
Did I mention they sell ripe bananas?

I really like the concept of of shopping at a green grocer's, but unfortunately not many of these still exist, and those that do are often nowhere near my daily wanderings.
Enter Fruit-A-Licious which I'm sure I'd seen before but didn't really properly clock until The Man and I passed it the other day and I realised that I didn't have any broccoli for our pizza (it's amazing, try it).
So, I popped in, had a gander at what was on offer, and hunted down the broccoli.
Apparently this broccoli is dipped in invisible gold, as a medium head cost me £1.50.
£1.50 for a head of broccoli??
It's not even organic or locally grown!
That's what broccoli costs from the farmer's market, NOT what it should cost at a green grocer's.
I realise it's going to be more than Tesco, and as we're in Morningside it'll be even more expensive than a normal green grocer's, but that's insanity.
Unfortunately, I won't be switching my shopping habits to support the little guy in this situation.
