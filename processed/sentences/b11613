Cindy and her staff are awesome!
They are detailed, receptive to my wishes.
They always have my dog leaving smelling, and looking her best!

Cindy does an awesome job on my two poodles.
She does exactly what I ask her to do.
She also has an area to wash the animals yourself.

Natalie dyed my dog ombr√© pink and I'm so in love!
They are so nice and seem to genuinely care about the animals.
They were very passionate and friendly.
I was there 30 mins just chit chatting.
It's a small family owned type of business run by a lady named Cindy.
Natalie was very enthused about doing something creative which she says is her specialty.
