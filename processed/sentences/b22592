Excellent bargain pizza -- see their website for cheap deals.
Their pizza was quite good, but their crust left a lot to be desired.
It was very chewy and bland.
But overall, it outclasses the usual chains.
The cheesy bread was alright, but not worth ordering again -- needed more garlic and cheese.
But it was quite cheap -- $4.99 for basically a 12" pizza with no sauce or toppings.
Delivery was about average (40 minutes) and the delivery-person was very amiable.

I don't know what it is about their cheese, but it taste as fresh as any i've had on a pizza.
The hot wings come in their own sauce which is also one of a kind.
For the price and the fact it doesn't taste like every other pizza out there.... definitely worth having again.
Crust is a bit lame, wish you could throw a Hungry Howie's or Pizza Hut crust on their pies.... but its still good pizza no matter how you slice it.

While in Tempe I was unable to get dinner so had to go out of my Hotel and look for something to eat.
I was willing to settle for Taco Bell or Jack in the box when I passed by Gusto's Pizza on West University.
Service was friendly and prompt.
Prices are very reasonable.
The food quality was very good.
I ordered the XL (16" pie) Deluxe Pepperoni pizza, and check this out, for $9.99 (regular price 14.99) and it was loaded!
Also ordered the Princess Pasta with Sausage for $6.00 and a Caesar salad for $4.99.
The pasta was very good and large portion.
Caesar was good as well.
Yes this is a hole in the wall, but I Highly Recommend you try.
