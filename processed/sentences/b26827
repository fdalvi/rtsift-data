BEWARE!
I took three full suits and nine ties up to them last week.
When I picked them up, I was happy to see that the hemming that I had requested was done ahead of schedule.
However, when I got home, I found that the ties had not been cleaned at all!
They were pressed but still had spots on them.
One even had particles of food on it.
Disgusting!
Considering I paid $18 to get the ties "Professionally Dry Cleaned", I find this "oversight" completely unacceptable.
I was told to bring them back in, and they'd be sent back out.
And for the cost, I will, but I won't be back again.
I feel like they were trying to pull one over on me and I don't appreciate it.
Yes, they are pricey- but NO YOU DON'T GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!
BEWARE!

Awful dry cleaners.
If you use them, be sure to count every item going in and every item coming back out.
Expect  to be occasionally missing items.
You will get items back with stains or smells that they did not have when going in, and if you question any of it, you'll get told it was your fault.
Also, if the ticket says "ready by 5" and you show up at 5:30, don't expect your clothes to be there.
Stay away!

This dry cleaners is able to have you finest garments starched, pressed, and out the door faster then any other place I've used before, the employees are always nice and welcoming, and haven't lost one piece of my clothing yet.
Thanks for being a reliable company.
