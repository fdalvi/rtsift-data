Always nice employees.
Great prices and decent food.

Well they gave us bacon instead of Canadian bacon.
Bad start to new place.

Always friendly staff with hot bread sticks and pizza during busy times.
I learned tonight this store treats their staff to an order of bread stick after their worked shift.
I don't know if this is all stores or just this location but great job franchise owner for taking care of the staff.

The pizzas are always ready on time.
They have a special taste that my kids love.
What I found out recently is that one topping is included in the $5.00 price!
