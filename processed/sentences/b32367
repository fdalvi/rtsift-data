They came through on the phone quote.
They were all pleasant to talk to and work with us when we left some items in the car.

The Hertz in Chandler was very pleasant when we first got our rental car.. when I tried to get a hold of them to ask questions about when and where to drop off the car I called 20 times got disconnected after hearing them laughing and joking in the background I got placed on a 20 minute hold with out anyone checking back with me.
I also talked to Cassie would told me that her computers were down and would give me a call back as soon ad they were back up which never happened.
When I finally got a hold of them again I spoke with Tyler who was very rude and wouldn't let me tell him why I was calling.
He cut me off and told me I didn't know what I was talking about.
I will NEVER rent from them again!!!
I wouldn't even give them 1 star...
