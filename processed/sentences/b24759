Lora is, without a doubt, one of the best massage therapists I have ever been to.
And I've been to a lot!
She's got over 12 years experience (so far) and it shows.
She always manages to work out any problems I bring up.. and will even find problem spots that I hadn't even noticed before.
All the big name massage spas and whatnot may be a little cheaper, but you don't get anywhere near the quality that you get here.
I'm more than willing to fork over a few extra dollars for a massage that blows away even the "top notch" resort spa massages I've had!

Lora is the only massage therapist I have used for the last few years!
I usually go in for a deep tissue massage to workout the muscle tension/spasms that come from working too hard and/or playing too hard.
I had been to several other massage therapist years prior for deep tissue massages without anywhere near the same results.
While more pressure is applied in a deep tissue massage Lora's technique and experience really differentiate her from anyone I have been to previously.
You can have a real deep tissue massage and have it be extremely relaxing at the same time with Lora.
The relief is immediate and last for days.
I would recommend Lora to anyone who is looking for deep tissue massage, Swedish massage, sports massage & CranioSacral Massage.
