Not a great Subway.
It almost never has another customer, for reasons that are pretty clear.
The staff is sullen and disinterested.
They skimp on the ingredients (especially the vegetables -- ask for more to get the stink eye).
Keep on going to the Subway on University and Country Club for a better experience.

This was the first local business I came to when I moved to Mesa, AZ.
The first time I order here the employees were rude and impatient.
I remember I sat down to eat and my sandwich fell apart.
I wanted to tell them but figured they would be rude.
To my surprise no one was even behind the counter, must have been in the back the whole time I sat and ate.
I figured I'd try them one more time... bad move, my tuna was gross and they were still very rude.
The A/C was working this time but didn't matter, I took my sandwich to go.
Skip this establishment.

This subway is ALWAYS stingy.
It doesn't matter who is making the sandwiches there is always more bread than meat cheese and veggies.
I do not recommend ever going to this subway.
My sandwich sucks everytime

I've been going to this subway for a long time.
It's not the nicest or biggest subway, but they have the best tuna of any subway.
Patty is the master of tuna, but you have to get her on a good day.
It can get kind of hot during the summer in there, but it's worth it.
Love my Patty tunes.
