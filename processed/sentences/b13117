What is up with themed convenience stores?
This one was pretty much trying to be "Mexico" - not a small part, but the whole country.
Above the cigarettes behind the counter has a wall boarder painted with rolling green hills and it says "Smoker Country.
That transitions into the space behind the register done all in saltillo tile.
Then the next wall has all sorts of little homes, casitas, and outdoor cafes on it's wall boarder - all in brown and jewel tones.
The walls where the refrigerated section and the walk in freezer have corrugated metal out at an angle like a roof, with beach themed items coming out here and there from "windows".
Dude.
Are ya serious??
Folks want a pack of smokes, some corn nuts and a slim jim.
Or a beer and some lotto tickets.
Does this really enhance our overall shopping experience?
Because if paying for all that means I'm paying more for my YooHoo then you can take it all back right now.
Sure, it's well lit, well stocked, and seems to hire fairly competent people - but that theme is all I vividly remember every time I drive away.

Like a quick trip through time this one will boggle your brain.
Get lost in the various aisles of deliciousness.
Hot Dogs.
Check.
Sausage.
Check.
Peanut Butter.
Check.
Everything to crave your late night munchies.
Grab a pack a cigs mate, they are buy one get one free.

Bad Service and Mean management !!!
No people skills

I go for the redbox!!!
The people that work there are nice too.
Nothing outstanding about the place but it's good.

Good place but there's always a bum asking for money while your trying to get a movie out of the redbox.
