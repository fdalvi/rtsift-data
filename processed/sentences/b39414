How could you go wrong with Wetzels Pretzels?
Soft, hand rolled, buttered and salted pretzels made throughout the day.
This is the very reason you cannot be on a diet when you go to the mall.
Seriously, you may try to play it cool and pretend the delicious smell does not affect you in any way as you stroll pass, but who are we kidding?
I highly recommend the cheese pretzel and Cin-A-Yum.
After eating a few of these you will be telling people, "I wash myself with a rag on a stick.

Best pretzel bites around!

Very bad customer service.
Look out for the lady ismara behind the counter.
She's the wetzel pretzel devil!

My family and I never make a trip to the mall without stopping by for our fav the wetzel bits with jalapeno cheese!
