Zazou is a friendly little floating cafe docked on the Union Canal adjacent to Harrison Park.
They offer hot and cold drinks as well as a few snacks.
The interior is pleasant with wooden tables and chairs.
Our drinks were served in glass - not paper or plastic.
We were a crew of three moms and four under-fours.
The amiable proprietor did not bat an eye at the ensuing chaos and was very accommodating.
There were even complimentary crayons and paper for the wee ones.
If you are on, or near, the canal, definitely pop in for a cuppa or a snack!
You can duck inside out of the rain, or sit at the helm in the sun!
I will definitely be returning.

A cool little cafe on a narrowboat docked in a tree lined canal near a cute bridge-not the newest decor inside but a cozy place nevertheless!
You can sit outside too!
The chai tea was just alright but the assorted desserts they have are really good (all packaged and inexpensive)-the millionaire's shortbread was awesome.
flapjack & viennese swirl were pretty good.
The owner's cute dog adds a nice touch!
It's a great place for a lazy afternoon & perfect for a date!

Tucked away and out of plain sight, you could walk straight past this place and never know it existed.
Why?
Because it's a cafe on a narrowboat!
The cafe is open Thu - Sun, so make sure to take a wander along the canal on one of those days so you can nip in to this quaint place, enjoy a brew and feel the ground under feet shoogle with your weight.
A friendly guy kitted out in spectacular dreadlocks seems to run the cafe.
We only stayed for tea and coffee, but the hot beverages provided were lovely and also cheap.
Apparently the coffee was excellent.
There are also cakes, vegan options and biscuits on offer, so those wanting a sweet treat with their tea will be well rewarded.
Can't really recommend more.
Great secret place to find in the city.
