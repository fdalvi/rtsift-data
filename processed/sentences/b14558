I've lived at Mark Taylor properties for about five or six years now and I have to say, they have declined greatly in the last few years.
When I first started living at my first MT property, the front office staff took the time to get to know you, knew you by name, kept abreast of any ongoing issues and were proactive about things.
Now, they really seem to be nothing more than shills for what Mark Taylor has become, reacting to issues only when implored to do so.
Rent constantly goes up, even for those of us that have shown property loyalty years over.
Additional "fees" are even being added on for services that you may or may not even use -- either way you have to pay.
The only reason that I didn't give them one star is because of the maintenance staff.
They are what the front office staff used to be.
Friendly, polite and very responsive to your problems.
They, in fact, have a pretty similar opinion of the "front office" folks as I do.
That is pretty telling.

My husband and I lived here from 2009-2010 so this may be a little dated.
However, I can say with confidence that during this time period,  this was a very nice apartment complex and we enjoyed living here.
Rent was very reasonable for such a nice area (hop, skip and a jump from Ocotillo.
) Our apartment itself was lovely with upgraded appliances and a great kitchen.
The two bedroom we were in was spacious, had great natural lighting and was overall very nice.
I wasn't a huge fan of their parking policy.
We had one covered space and the other was a first come first serve.
We didn't take advantage of the amenities as often as we should have but when we did they were a reminder of the spoils of apartment living.
San Palacio has a great pool with cabanas and tons of space in the immediate area.
I enjoyed our time at this apartment complex and would recommend it to anyone looking for an apartment in Chandler.
