I use fossil fuels.
It's a fact.
And this is where I often get them.
I'm sure you're thinking that I'm gassing up here and it's true, I do hit the petrol as hard as anybody.
I haven't managed to kick that habit yet.
But it's the propane I get here too.
They are quick and convenient to top off the BBQ tank.
Whenever I pop my head in and say I need propane, dude behind the counter hollers for a woman.
She comes out to the tank and fills it up.
Quickly and professionally, observing all applicable safety standards and OSHA regulations.
Much more competent than Gomer at the Home Depot.

Very cheap gas prices compare to where I live and work.
It's right off I-10 & Chandler Blvd.
between Ahwatukee & Chandler.
Very clean and has a lot of lighting, so you won't have to fear your life for being robbed.
This place is open 24/7 so you can stop by anytime you want.

This is a solid location.
First, I feel that Chevron has the best fuel around and I try to go here whenever I need to gas up.
This location is a little fated, but is clean, functional, and convenient.
They offer gas, propane refills, and a car wash, and have a large selection inside, especially for the size of the store.
