my favorite mexican tire shop in Vegas.
great place for a quick tire plug n patch.
some good tread used tires or maybe even some new ones..
I've been to other mexican 24hr tire shops but this i open 24hrs a day.. pay cash or debit (no credit cards) ..service is good..

Please be careful .% 100 they will  try to increase sales.Crooks.Just crooks.At least every two months just because I have no choice I come to this place.Whenever disappointed again.Money is not my problem at all just this place always, always want more and more money.Crooks.If you are not stressed like me and if you have a spare wheel look elsewhere

Stay awayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Yelperasssssssssss Stay awayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Again and again and again the will try to charge more money!!!!!
