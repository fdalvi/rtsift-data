Outstanding service!!
We felt welcomed from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.
Our food was absolutely delicious!
Sliced fliet mignon on a bed of risotto and Scallops.. and the Fleming's potatoes!!
Yumm!!
Such a wonderful night!

Amazing restaurant, food and five star service!
I came here for my wife's birthday and we were treated so well!
They waitress gave my wife some chocolate truffles and a $25 gift card and a birthday card as a gift!
The steaks and appetizers were delicious... And the dessert was spectacular!
I reccomend this resturant to anyone especially at this location in town square.
Thanks Stacey (our waitress) and flemings for a great evening!

WOW!
We had dinner here last night and the service was spectacular.
Maybe the best service we've ever had...from the valet, to the hostess, to our server, to the manager.
Our server was Cristian L. and he did a wonderful job.
I couldn't have asked for a better meal or a better experience.
I am so impressed by this Fleming's location.
Incidentally, we were at the Mandarin Oriental the day before and the service at Fleming's was so much better!
We had such a great time and I've already made reservations for Valentine's Day.

Fleming's has to be my favorite steakhouse.
The service is always remarkable and I've never had a bad meal here, ever.
This location in particular is gorgeous.
It's on Las Vegas Blvd, but not in the congested area of The Strip.
So, you get a wonderful view of the huge, lit up hotels through all of the glass.
There is an open kitchen with glass so you can see everyone doing their part, but you don't have to hear dishes clanking and steaks sizzling while you're trying to have an enjoyable meal.
What I like about Fleming's is that it's a great atmosphere with fantastic food, warm hospitality and beautiful ambiance.
I ordered a petite filet with spicy shrimp on top and my father ordered a bone in rib-eye.
My father always orders his steaks "well done" but the server helped me in talking my father down to medium.
My father said he has never had a better tasting piece of meat in his life!
He and I also shared a side of fries and mac & cheese.
My father had a vodka martini and I had a "50 Shades of Rose.
" My cocktail was fresh, light and did just enough to relax me.
We finished off with Creme Brûlée and a Lava Cake.
Perfect end to a great meal.
Whenever I'm in Vegas, you better believe I'm stopping in!

I was impressed how smooth the dining experience was despite how recently the location opened, my server was sweet, personable and quite knowledgeable.
Normally I never remember servers names but her's was unique... Sundae.. Great recommendations on the bone-in strip and the carrot cake with the rum sauce!
Great experience!

So my review will be a bit biased because we went for a Fleming's event so everything was done to impress us, but I give it 5 stars because impressed, I was.
First of all, this place is high-end classy.
Do not show up in sneakers or a t-shirt as my unfortunate plus 1 learned too little too late.
The servers are on point and you just feel luxurious being IN the venue in general.
We tried a bunch of passed apps and everything was truly amazing.
The most amazing thing was the seafood tower with giant prawns and crab claws already cracked and ready to be eaten.
We also found out that they have an amazing Happy Hour every day from 5-7pm where a selection of wine and apps are only $6.
That's an amazing deal for a restaurant of this caliber.
I will absolutely be taking full advantage of this soon!

Great customer service, amazing modern ambiance, great music, sub par filet for the price.
Our total bill was 225.00, 2 petite filets, 1 side, 1 bottle of wine, plus dessert.
Standard for a Vegas steakhouse.
Nothing special, but but not bad.
We hate to send anything back to the kitchen, but when my husbands filet came out and it was hard to cut, and mushy on the inside we agreed to ask for a new cut.
Thanks to William, a new cut was brought out cooked to perfection.
We are torn if we will return, as you can have the same bill at Hanks (gvr) stk ( strip).
But the customer service is for sure it's saving grace .
Thank you William!!

Derrick & Kristin at the bar, love em!
They went surprisingly above our expected amazing service.
Love the modern, open ambiance.
The Food was somehow a bit better than the usual absolutely amazing.
We have no idea how they pulled off better than the best, but it is happening.
Flemings Summerlin, consider yourselves upstaged.

After some disappointing meals at some other LV steakhouses Fleming's excelled.
My wife and I are great fans of our local Flemings herein California.
We had mentioned to our local Flemings manager that we would be dining at their new LV operation.
When we arrived it was like our waitress was a mind reader.
She knew our preference, everything from seating, cocktails, appetizers, food allergies and entrees.
Our local Flemings had forwarded our profile to LV.
Customer care doesn't get any better than this (and the dinner was outstanding).

Actually it was a 4.5 star but Yelp doesn't have increments of .5.
It would have been a 5 star but when we made reservations for our Valentines dinner they seated us in a nice quite area but under the HVAC vents that kept blowing on us uncomfortably.
It was blowing so hard at times that the flame for my drawn butter kept blowing out.
Everyone did their best to take care of the situation.
I believe it's a design problem.
Caution; do not sit at tables against the walls to the left as you enter the restaurant.
I would have given them a 5-star if they had comp'd us a dessert or even offered anything.
Anyways, by far one of the best steakhouses in Vegas.
We ordered the Valentine's pre-fixed menu.
Both came with appetizer (scallop), salad, and entrée.
I had the filet (medium rare) and it was cooked to perfection (melted in my mouth).
The filet was paired with a lobster (delish) and a potato casserole.
My wife order the filet paired with salmon.
I tasted the salmon and it was not good; really strong fishy taste and smell (would not recommend the salmon).
The wine list was amazing (by the glass).
We didn't have dessert because I had plans for later.
The best part of our experience was meeting our server, Kate.
It's wonderful to get to know someone as she had the time to share her life story and we also got to share ours.
Thank you Kate for your personal touch and the time spent with us.
You made our Valentines dinner extra memorable.
We would return again for special celebrations, but beware it's pricey ($$$) but entirely worth it.

Absolutely love this new location.
Celebrated Valentine's Day and we both ordered the Valentine's menu which included a scallop appetizer, tasty caesar and Filet mignon with lobster.
Ordered the hot doughnuts for dessert and every damn thing we had was perfect.
We also enjoyed the "quiet" dining.
It just didn't seem very loud as someone else mentioned.
It was a full house and we could visit the entire evening without having to yell over the din.
That noise thing is getting to be such a problem at many restaurants and I for one am going to stop going to the ones that offend my senses with a too loud environment.
Loved the wall of candles and I will always reserve that area in the future.
I also liked the Ipad with a full wine list.
Love that feature.....except I was a little squeamish about touching a screen others had touched.
Still didn't slow me down from using the feature :)  All in all, a very welcome addition to the Town Square dining options.

I would give this a 5 star if we weren't disturbed by the wait staff every 2-3 minutes.
The food is definitely tasty.
We were there for Valentine's Day and had the Valentine menu.
Fantastic Modern Cesar Salad.
It was also my first time trying a scallop.
They also gave us some rich chocolate truffles at the end.
it was nice.
The main issue is there were 3 people waiting on us and we were constantly disturbed by them wanting to pour more water in our glass, even though it was already full enough, our waiter constantly coming up and talking to us or asking how the food was.
I didn't get that romantic Valentine's Day dinner that I wanted to have with my hubby.

If you are in the mood for the world best lava cake, Flemings is the only option.
This restaurant is perfect for a romantic evening.

Food, service and ambiance were absolutely perfect.
Thank you Fleming's for a great evening.
This is our new go-to spot for a nice dinner.

This was my first time to the Town Square location and it was just as good, if not better than the Summerlin location.
The decor is definitely more modern.
My only gripe with the experience here was the wait time even though we had reservations, but it was also Valentine's Day weekend....so I'll let that go.
From start to finish, this place has delicious food and amazing service.
For starters, the bread comes with the gorgonzola and sun dried tomato butters.
For the appetizer, I always get the mushroom ravioli.
It's probably the best mushroom ravioli I've ever had.
It is pricy...so if you want to give this a try without the full price, they also have it on their happy hour menu as well.
I went with the dry aged rib eye this time and it was perfectly marbled with fat.
My fiance ordered the bone-in rib eye, while it was also cooked to perfection, the steak was probably 1/3 large chunks of fat.
I would definitely go with the boneless dry aged steak for value.
For sides, creamed spinach is a favorite of ours.
We also tried the Fleming's potatoes which is similar to scalloped potatoes.
It was creamy with a slight kick from the jalapenos.
I don't think they describe the potatoes well enough in their menu, but definitely better than the mashed potato options we've tried there.
For dessert we got the chocolate lava cake with pistachio crumble, ice cream and chantilly cream.
I must say this was a perfect end to our meal.
I've been to a lot of the strip steak houses and I would say this place has a lower price point with similar service and food.
Also, Costco always has $100 vouchers for $80, so you are saving some there as well!

Enjoyed an outstanding meal here last.
Server, Liz was charming and attentive and her assistant , Brian was spot on with serving water, bread and removing dishes timely.
Our booth in the rear of the restaurant was perfect for our party of four and offered a view of the bustling kitchen.
Crowded on a Monday yet noise level was moderate and enabled conversation.
We will be back!

Tuesday night...overflowing crowd and people being turned away...just to let you know they did have challenges that night.
Service was GREAT but the wait ;people seemed very unsure of themselves or overwhelmed by the # of people but still they did their job well....the chefs did not...food was wrong or not as ordered or bad cuts of meat...the wine list was really good BUT to charge more than DOUBLE....they do allow you to bring your own but with a nominal corking fee of $20...well worth it since we brought $100 bottles....Wonderful to have Valet parking...food prices were more than they should be...6oz filet, for example...$30 would have been OK but it was $42..no baked potato or really nothing substantial with it...The Caesar salad was skimpy and not attractive...their version of Cabrese needed more cheese.
Deserts were wonderful.
But overall it does not measure up to other Flemings we have been to in other states in food or ambiance...not even as good as the other one here which is not my choice due to lack of ambiance and to brightly lit which this one was properly lit for dinner.
Anyway...not a good choice for a wonderful dinner when we have so many others to chose from.

What an amazing staff they have here at Flemings, they really made my best friends 22nd birthday dinner special.
Erin was our server, she was very detailed in explaining the menu items as well as making sure we were well taken of.
She even went above and beyond to help us choose a Vegas club to celebrate the birthday boy.
All wait staff were so amazingly friendly and attentive to our needs, our water glasses never went half empty and the manager came around and introduced himself to make sure we were having a perfect time.
Our steaks were perfectly cooked.
The iron crisp was a perfect choice in cooking our ribeyes.
Mac n cheese, mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were all the perfect pairings for our steaks.
Erin complimented the birthday boys dinner with a box of truffles and a gift card for our next visit.
A truly amazing restaurant with a special group of people that ensure you're enjoying your experience.
Thank you everyone!
I'll be back.

I knew I had to try Flemings at least once after seeing they opened a new location at Town Square, plus I'm a huge fan of dry aged steaks.
After reviewing the menu, I decided to try the Dry Aged Prime Rib Eye ($53) and add the King Crab Meat with Caviar on top.
When the steak arrived, the first thing I noticed was how disappointing the amount of crab and caviar on top was.
From the photos I saw posted by the restaurant, I was expecting a little more meat & caviar.
See comparison photo below.
As far as the steak goes, I ordered it Medium Rare and was cook perfectly.
However, the steak was slightly tough in certain cuts and I felt like this was not a Prime piece of rib-eye.
Having just ate at Smith & Wollensky's just last week, I could definitely tell S&W's steaks were far superior to Flemings as far as rib-eye steaks goes.
We also ordered the mushrooms & asparagus.
They were good but not very big portions to share.
I would recommend 1 side per person.
Hope this review helps!

This review will be short because Fleming's is really one of those places that you just have to try to realize how good it is.
Great service, wide selection of wine, and a fantastic happy hour.
We sat outside because we did not have a reservation.
Pleasantly surprised that happy hour applied to outside as well!
Everything is $6 each on the menu.
I got a red blend (which paired up nicely with my steak) and the carpaccio.
Oh man, the carpaccio was huge!
Super unexpected.
The taste was decent but the tenderness of the meat and the presentation was appealing.
My petit filet minon was pretty good but not mindblowing.
It was the Fleming's potatoes that did me in...Layers upon layers of softness surrounded by a crispy exterior.
My boyfriend ordered the prime ribeye and it honestly was the juiciest and most delicious ribeye I have ever tasted.
Definitely ordering that next time.
You get a complimentary sauce as well!
I got the peppercorn and he got the chimichurri.
Both were pretty good and the flavors did not overwhelm the steaks' own flavor.
Oh and the complimentary bread they serve in the beginning...Hot and fresh and comes with a cheese (bleu, I believe) dip and an herbed butter spread.
I would have eaten more If I wasn't saving room for the steak!
-1 star because it's a tad overpriced in my opinion for some menu items.
The items are a la cart so when you pay $40 for a steak you only get that and no sides (unless specifically listed in the menu).
The $9 Fleming's salad was probably one of the biggest rip-offs I have ever paid for.
It was basically a few pieces of lettuce with one or two grape tomatoes.
They tried to play it off as fancy by having a giant unique crouton and serving the bowl and salad fork cold.
It was not worth it at all.
I take tiny bites and the salad only took me 3 or 4 bites max.
The only reason I went there was because of my $40 gift card, which reduced the bill to $80 (two steaks, one HH appetizer, two HH wines, and a salad).
Now we know that the place is solid so we'll come back for HH someday!

Celebrated an anniversary dinner at Fleming's, the service and food we received were excellent!
Our server Sundae was very helpful in placing our orders.
My husband had the prime rib special and I had the petite filet mignon with Diablo shrimp.
Both cuts of meat were cooked to perfection and the Fleming's potatoes, just awesome.
The restaurant atmosphere was relaxing and we enjoyed our evening as well as our dining experience!

As others commented the service was sub par.
There were over 30 staff members, not cooks or dishies, all waiters and waitresses mostly congregated in the kitchen and few to none at the tables.
Service was slow, bread never replenished, wine service not up to par for a restaurant of this price range.
I had the wedge salad which is more of a do it yourself project in this restaurant.
The bacon and blue cheese come whole and you have to chop and garnish yourself.
I had the king crab legs which for $42 I expected to be fresh steamed and tender.
They were previously cooked and reheated, stringy and not very flavorful with cold spots confirming they had been previously cooked  crime caramel was very good.
For the same money we had eaten at Del Friscos the night before.
Much better food and impeccable service.
Save your money and go somewhere else

I had eaten in Flemings on the north side of Las Vegas in the past.
The Henderson restaurant just recently opened so we thought we should check it out.
We requested a quiet table.
We were seated at the very back of the restaurant in a quiet area - just what we wanted.
They had a special for the night, a "Tomahawk" steak, a bone in ribeye for two for $92.
Part of the special is that the chef comes out and carves it at the table.
The steak was perfectly prepared, pink in the center as we requested.
Since it comes with no sides,we ordered a portion of sauteed mushrooms.
Everything was delicious, cooked to perfection.
Dessert was the chocolate lava cake which came with 2 small scoops of vanilla ice cream - YUMMY!
The service was also excellent.
My water glass never did get lower than halfway down before being refilled.
The only real down side to the restaurant is that it is on the pricey side so I will save it as a special occasions restaurant rather than a regular "where should we go to eat tonite" place.

Las Vegas Restaurant Week 7 - 14 Mar 2014 so I had dinner here on Sun/9 Mar: HelpOutDineOutlv.org     menu supporting charity   http://bit.ly/1lN4Blq  - About 8 pm I just did a walk-in and sat in the bar area.
Jessica was my awesome server.
- $40.14 for a 3-course dinner at my favorite steakhouse chain is a good deal (best value at Fleming's is their sweet happy hour food/drink specials).
Dinner came with sourdough bread with 2 types of spread to use.
- I forgot to buy a Costco Fleming gift card pack ($80 for $100 to use at Fleming's) to save 20%, but this meal was already supporting charity so no biggie.
- I like this Fleming's and the one in Summerlin equally as much.

The glowing reviews of the Fleming's Yelp Elite event here are what made me want to try the place and I'm very glad I did.
Better than Ruth Chris and on a whole other level than a Outback Steak (duh).
The only other place that would give this place a challenge would be BLT Steak in NYC.
Service: 5 Stars Food: 4.5  Stars  Bread: Two of us went through 4 loaves.
Fresh out of the oven with two choices of softened butter.
I couldn't get enough of the Chipotle butter (reddish one).
If it was in the store I'd buy it.
SALAD: "Modern Caesar" Fine.
Generous with the parmesan and prosciutto .
FLEMING'S POTATOES: Was enough for two people.
Served almost in a small casserole dish.
Their excellent version of scalloped potatoes.
Crunchy layer of cheese on top.
Whole thing was delicious and filling.
PRIME RIB: Served rare and was ok, a little bland...I've had award winning prime rib (In Tallahassee, Florida!
) that was much better...but all in all it wasn't bad.
Served with 3 dipping sauces which were much needed.
MAIN FILET MIGNON: Perfect outer sear.
Tender.
Perfect medium.
One of the better better filet's I can remember tasting...girlfriend got this one...I'll have to jump on this next time.
Was about as good as the one at Central (Caesar's Palace).
DESERT: Molten Lava cake: Comes not only with ice cream but also a dish of "Chantilly cream".
Baked to perfection...nice ooze of chocolate.
SERVICE: This is really where they shine.
I think we had about 3 people waiting on us.
They really do take care of their customers.
Even the general manager came around and asked how everything was and if there was anything we needed.
Drinks were never less than half full, always a restock of bread, dishes cleared.
Very warm and professional staff.
SUGGESTION: One minor thing...very minor...if you show us the dessert menu in the beginning when the customer starts ordering and you tell them the chocolate lava cake takes 25 minutes and the customer says they'll have 2 at the end of the meal, if you notice the customer is almost done with that last bite of dinner or at least half done with their steak, perhaps fire up that lava cake right then and there knowing that it'll take 25 minutes...or ask the diner if they still have room and if they'd like to have the kitchen get started on it...when we finished up our main course there was about a 25 minute overlay before desserts came.
Not a huge deal, just a suggestion.
I noticed they have a filet and lobster special running all the way into April and are also a part of restaurant week.
I may be coming back here sooner than expected.
Looking forward to my next good meal here and would recommend this place to others.

Came here a few nights ago to check out their full menu after a Yelp event and ordered the dry-aged ribeye and the peppercorn steak.
I thought the peppercorn steak was perfect while the ribeye could use a little more seasoning.
I also asked for the cream spinach as a side dish and that was DEFINITELY my favorite item out of the three.
It's a little pricey even after I used a $50 off code.
I think they have a happy hour menu that's a lot more reasonable.
Maybe I will come back for that next time.

We went for happy hour last Thursday and found a seat in the bar area right away.
The iPad wine list is a great feature, especially the "Spin the Bottle" section.
Highly recommend the Baked Brie appetizer and the Salt and Pepper Shrimp.
Our server, Derrick, was excellent; very personable and attentive!
Will definitely be back.

Had an awesome dinner!
Reservations were at 8:30 and they seated us early.
Cristian Ionita was a phenomenal waiter!
His recommendations were spot on!
Lobster tempura, filet and scallops were cooked perfect.
2 bottles of the Coppola Cab 2011 and the mac n cheese made for a perfect evening!
Thanks Cristian.
Hope to see you soon!

Got a living social coupon for free $50 dining credit.
I ended up paying a total of $135 after that deduction and I wasn't too happy about it.
Granted I knew the place is pricey but I didn't think it was worth the price tag honestly (at least for the steaks).
My bf and I ordered - Calamari (super yummy) - Pork Belly (3 pc of pork slice for $13, not worth it and it was mostly fat) - Ribeye w/ crab legs (my bf didn't get a very good cut, whereas I did but whatever it was cooked with, when it was brought out, the smell made me very nauseous) - Mashed Potato (super yummy) - Signature Dessert (super yummy)  Their Parmesan bread with the sun dried tomato butter is awesome!
We ended up eating 3 loafs of those lol.
There was a lot of waiter/waitresses, I was amazed.
The service was wonderful, very attentive.
Love their to go back and the little card they attach to it where you can go to a website and learn what you can do with your leftovers.
I thought that was pretty unique.
Overall, it was not bad.
Although not sure we would come here again unless we got gift cards.
I'd rather go to Border Grill inside Mandalay Bay or to Brand Steakhouse inside Monte Carlo for their steak.

I'm giving this Flemings location a 3 star because their service is pretty bad.
I've been here 3 times thinking the service will get better but I'm wrong every time.
Every waiter takes very long to greet you, get you drinks, bring the bread, bring the food and check on you.
This place is not cheap and service should be excellent.
The food is great though and the ONLY reason we keep going back.
The Dry Aged Rib Eye is amazing, along with the Short Ribs, Flemings Potatos and Onion Soup.
The most amazing part is you will always see managers walking around and still the service is that bad.
Hopefully, they'll get their act together.

My G/F and I went here after reading reviews I have to say it's just another disappointment in an expensive steak.
The wait staff was attentive but our particular waitress didn't seem to knowledgable about the menu.
She was fumbling and just had to think a lot about certain ?s I asked.
In a place like this the service should be professional and top notch.
It simply was not in our case.
Also the steak I was wanting they were already out of for the night.
I hoped to order the dry aged ribeye.
But I had to settle for the bone in ribeye that is not dry aged.
When it came out it honestly was a little tough even though being ordered med rare not at all what I expected for a $60 steak.
It just was blah really did not have much flavor to it at all.
It was really a shame because I think I could do better at home on my grill.
We also had crab cakes which were tasty and grilled asparagus which didn't have much flavor either.
Loaded baked potatoe was pretty good.
Lava cake for dessert was good also.
With 1 glass of wine and tip our bill came to $175.
Considering I didn't get the steak I asked for the least I thought they could do was comp and app.
Or a glass of wine for us.
Just an expensive chain restaraunt I don't see what all the fuss is about.
We honestly could have had a better meal at a place in southern highlands called Off the strip.
They steak was about the same quality I could have gotten there for 40% less $$ the sides are just as good.
The same meal there prob would be under $100 for the 2 of us.
No one came around asking how is the food.
I really should have sent the steak back and gotten something else.
The waitress just asked how it was cooked and if I needed anything else.
Never suggested or offered any sauces.
I cut into it and it looked fine just didn't have any flavor.
If she had come back around I prob would have said something.
Just saying for $175 I expected a lot better.
Just call it like I see it...

I've been to Flemings a few times in other locations as my parents are big fans.
The BF though has never been.
They started us with the bread, which I hate that I want to eat all of it as there's always so much rich food to follow.
They do a plain loaf but the sundried tomato butter and the gorgonzola cranberry spread are both so good!
I got the prime rib which is a sunday special.
It comes with a salad choice, a side, and a dessert making it a good value package deal.
I chose the modern caesar which was very fresh and I appreciate it is not over dressed.
The prime rib itself was solid as far as prime rib go.
They could have served it more rare, as my medium rare was leaning into medium territory, but not a deal breaker for me.
I think though if I had to choose a steak or this, dry aged steak wins.
It comes with au jus, creamy horseradish and a nice mustard sauce.
The BF got the dry aged ribeye.
It was cooked perfectly medium rare and the flavor and char was perfect.
He could not get over this steak and said it was one of the best he's ever had.
I had bites and indeed that is worth its price.
Mine came with a side so I got creamed spinach and it was super creamy and just perfect.
I make a solid creamed spinach and that I say is begrudgingly better than mine.
The BF also wanted a starch so we got blue cheese mashed potato.
They need not skimp on the blue cheese butter!
I picked their signature lava cake as my dessert that came with my prime rib.
It was gooey inside, but it didn't lava out when cut.
The flavor was very nice.
The ice cream was solid as was the chantilly cream they serve on the side.
Service was very attentive from our main server, the runners but none were overbearing.
I really liked our server Stacey in fact.
Im awful with names, but I actually remembered because she was good.The manager came by as well to make sure everything was exceptional once we got our entrees.
I've also always liked places that did things like crumb clean up after bread service and change out your silverware for different courses and chilled utensils for cold/frozen courses.
I feel like that should be standard for a nice spot, but I've been to many where it is not.
For a chain steakhouse, I think it rocks.
It's a bit pricey and in a place that is abundant in steak house culture it may not be the first choice, but it's a solid choice.
It'll be a moment until my next visit, but this visit was exceptional to warrant the 5 star.

Great service, great food.
Love the wedge salad, the filet and lobster tail, and the creme brûlée...
This is one of our favorite restaurants.

Went here last night for my fiancé's birthday.
Our server, Erik, was great!
The food was delicious (especially the Flemings potatoes and carrot cake)!
My fiancé said it was the best dining experience he's ever had.
Erik made us feel like VIPs with complimentary chocolates and $25 gift card to return...and even the manager stopped by to see how we were doing.
The complimentary bread is really good too!
Sure, it's a little pricey but totally worth it!
Thank you Flemings!

My husband and I recently celebrated our 16th Wedding Anniversary and had dinner at Fleming's.
We had a MARVELOUS experience!!!
I wish I could give them 100 stars!
Knowing that it was our special occasion, the amazing staff(from the hostess to server Chaz to managers, Leroy and Jennifer)made sure we had nothing but memorable top notch service(they really went above and beyond from the moment we checked in until we left)!
We've eaten at countless steakhouses, but I have to say that we've never had such a mind-blowing experience!
Our entire meal was deliciously PERFECT!
We CANNOT wait to return!

Earl and I finally made it here for happy hour (weekdays from 5-7pm).
When we arrived, there were a few spots at the bar so we chose two open seating.
We were presented with a bowl of house made chips and the HH menu.
I placed an orde5r for a Moscow Mule right away.
The HH menu is pretty straight forward.
5 for $6 til 7pm.
5 types of cocktail, 5 types of wine by the glass, and 5 types of appetizers, each selection for $6.
For under $50, Earl and I had: -3 Moscow Mules: Perfect balance of vodka, ginger beer, and everything else that made it so delicious.
After 1/2 of this drink, I was buzzed.
-1 Dirty Martini:  Earl chose this drink.
I smelled it and handed it back to Earl.
Pretty strong.
-Tenderloin Carpaccio:  A full plate thinly sliced tenderloin, topped with sliced spinach, paired with the creole mustard sauce, capers, and cheesy crostini.
I really enjoyed this dish.
-Pan-crisp Pork Belly:  The pork belly was served with goat cheese grits and sweet onion chutney.
It was overall a good appetizer.
I wish there was something, like pickled something to cut the richness of the dish.
The bill came out just shy of $40 pre tip.
The service was excellent.
Our bartenders (Kristin and Danielle) are so attentive and personable.
I highly recommend Fleming's for Happy Hour!

My boyfriend maaade me go as he is a huge steak lover.
I however, am a pescatarian but my experience here was absolutely amazing.
We were pleasantly greeted right when we walked in and the restaurant was clean and had a great vibe.
I work in the hospitality industry so I know good service and our server, Tommy was better than most.
His Sauvignon Blanc recommendation was perfectly paired with my mushroom pasta starter and my boyfriend had a nice robust Cab with his steak, which he said was perfectly cooked.
We took Tommys suggestion and shared the Carrot Cake and an Expresso Martini to top off the night.
We ended up staying for almost 2 hours, Tommy made sure our timing was just what we wanted and the food was flavorful and had a great presentation.
We will definitely be back thanks to the great food, service and atmosphere!

Boyfriend and I saw that they were doing a special steak & lobster pairing for $39.95 and couldn't resist.
We went in last night around 7:15pm.
Make sure you make reservations.
It seemed busy.
The service was topnotch, as expected.
So onto the food.
We started off with the complimentary bread service, which comes with sundried tomato butter and gorgonzola and cranberry infused butter.
Both spreads were amazing and I could have eaten them with a spoon.
The steak & lobster special came with an amuse bouche of scallop over polenta.
This little plate of heaven was sooooo good!
The scallop was perfectly cooked and the polenta had a nice texture and was perfectly seasoned.
Together, these two things were amazing.
Next you get a wedge salad or French onion soup, which we opted for one of each.
Both were great.
The French onion soup is one of the best I've ever had, but so so so rich.
At this point I was starting to get full.
But our entrees came, along with a side of mac & cheese that ordered extra.
They looked beautiful.
Our server deshelled our 8 oz.
lobster tail tableside, which was kind of neat.
Both of our steaks, 8 oz.
filets, were perfectly cooked and seasoned.
The meat was so tender and melt in your mouth.
The lobster was tender and full of flavor.
Overall, this was one of the best "fancy" meals I've ever had.
There is not one thing to complain about.
Best of all, we had a $25 gift card, so our meal with 2 glasses of wine came to $90.
I seriously felt like we were robbing the place.
Such amazing food at such an amazing price.

Went for happy hour soon after the opened this location.
Ordered a Russian Mule, but didn't care for it...
I don't think their recipe is authentic.
Ordered a bunch of apps from the happy hour menu.
Most were OK, but I wouldn't order the pork belly again- not worth it.

Trying to get my birthday reviews in before the month of March is over.
Been here twice already.
One time for an Elite Event and another time my special someone took me here for my birthday dinner.
Service here so far has been top-notch.
Our waiter was very enthusiastic while letting us know their current specials and his personal recommendations.
When we had questions about how the steaks were prepared (dry aged versus wet aged) or the differences between the types of wines my significant other was looking at, the waiter showed genuine interest with his answers.
APPETIZERS -FRENCH QUARTER BBQ SHRIMP: packed full of flavor.
Big and juicy shrimps marinated in garlic and spices.
-THE BIG WEDGE: my SO is a big wedged salad fan.
Blue cheese dressing with bacon bits.
He enjoyed it.
ENTREES -He ordered the PEPPERCORN STEAK.
Prime new york strip, cracked black and white peppercorns, F17 steak sauce, french green beans.
-I ordered the wet aged PRIME NEW YORK STRIP.
Well done please...lol.
Even with my steak well done, it was not dried at all.
My New York Strip had so much flavoring, I did not need any steak sauce.
Overall, we both really enjoyed our dishes.
SIDES FLEMING'S POTATOES.
Their infamous specialty.
Sliced potatoes with jalapeños and cheddar cheese.
THAT was freakin delicious!!!!!
Whoever is a big fan of potatoes, this is A MUST!!!!
We will definitely be back.
Every so often, if you sign up for their email promotions....they have some great deals going on.

I enjoyed the Yelp event held here and wanted to check them out for our anniversary dinner.
The husband was yet to try their food so I couldn't wait to bring him here.
Located right off of Las Vegas Blvd in Town Square, it's easy to locate and see.
They have plenty of parking with complimentary Valet available for those who choose.
Their dining area is elegant and comfortable.
They keep it very clean and classy.
I love it!
Our waiter for the evening was Tom C.  He was so informative of specials, HH, menu items and their 100 wine by the glass options.
Next time I dine here, I would definitely ask for him!
He really made our anniversary celebration very special!
Oh... you probably want to know about the food right?
Complimentary bread basket with the most amazing butter spreads.
Tomato basil and goat cheese goodness!
Luckily we stopped at only 1 basket because I could have easily filled up on that alone.
I started with the french onion soup that was divine!
Of course everything is better with cheese... but the herbs and spices used in the soup gave this savory flavor!
I had ordered the petit filet and lobster as it was one of their specials.
Petit in their mind was 8 oz.
It was more than I could handle.
But I sure did try to.
It was cooked perfectly flat ironed around the sides for one of the most flavorful and tender filets.
Lobster is always one of my favorites and it was the perfect combination with the filet.
The creamed spinach on the side had fresh shaved parmesan.
Like I said, everything is better with cheese!
Was I full?
Yes.
Did we stop there?
No.
Since it was a special occasion, we spilt the molten lava cake which had two scoops of vanilla ice cream on the side.
The 'molten lava' of chocolate oozing out of the center was almost more than I could handle.
Not to mention the chantilly cream it was topped with.
Fabulous!
To summarize~ Flemings = Fantastic!

Fleming is way too expensive for their dishes.
I ordered baked halibut with few pieces of broccoli.
The portion was small and it was $38.
Besides the boiled broccoli, nothing came with it.
Gf got three small  pieces of lamb chop for $25.
The ambient and staffs are nice but it is way over price.
The food is okay nothing special.
I saw many good reviews so I decided to try but disappointed.
I would expect a generous portion and a great taste for that price.
Would not come back or recommend.

First time here tonight & it was fantastic!
I was able to take advantage of their 3 course filet & lobster pairing for $39.95!
So yum!

Had to take off a star for our latest visit.
Sat in the center section in front of the kitchen and the noise level was too much.
Between the music and the folks trying to talk above it, it was just plain annoying.
Only thing that saved the days was the consistently good chow.
TURN DOWN DA MUSIC Flemings!

My wife and I went here for Date Night.
I don't think this is a good Date Night place.
5 stars for service, 4 for food, 2 for value and 1 for ambience.
So I averaged it at 3.
Ambience is more for the "power lunch/dinner" crowd.
We did get a nice booth but that didn't shelter us from the loud noise in this place.
Lots of fast-paced background music and lots of males in polo shirts with company logos.
Must be a convention in town.
They like to tout their dry-aged beef.
I've had good dry-aged beef (I've even done it myself) and theirs didn't seemed to have the qualities I have experienced in the past.
We had a steak that was basically a huge Ribeye meant to be shared for two for $100.
My wife's half was okay but the half I got was basically all fat which I don't much care for.
It was a sizeable steak but split in half you got two small ones.
It was overcooked to our taste but it is pretty hard to order a steak and get it the way you want.
The three sauces served on the side were good and paired well with the steak.
The sides were tasty and probably the best part of the meal.
Though I usually don't find Mac-n-Cheese to be something worthy of ordering in fine dining, theirs, with plenty of Gruyere cheese, did taste good.
They have a rather large wine list and probably the greatest thing about this restaurant is the Enomatic, allowing them to offer so many of them by the glass.
But, don't expect that to make it a value.
Service was friendly and excellent throughout.
The "Chef" came out with the steak and cut it for us.
Reservations are HIGHLY recommended at this location because it is always busy.
Overall, this place did not offer ambience and quality that I was looking for, especially for date night, and at the premium price.
If you are a big corporation trying to land an account and willing to spend the money on it, this place might be okay.
I now get a barrage of emails from them with deals.
One looks like it might be worth trying: 5 menu items for 6 dollars before 7.
I think it is only available at the bar.
So perhaps we'll see if Happy Hour is more enjoyable.

My wife and I had such a great experience eating at Fleming's Steakhouse at Towne Square Las Vegas.
We wanted to try it out since it is newly opened and we are huge fans of the location being Las Vegas locals.
The food we ordered was exquisite, in particular our Alaskan King Crab Legs and our dry aged Ribeye.
What is so beautiful about Flemings at Town Square is we can get the high quality food we enjoy without the hastle of the Strip car traffic and foot traffic at the casinos!!
What truly made our experience was our server Tom, who carried himself with a professionalism and elegance you expect at fine dining restaurants.
He treated us as though our time and money was of value and not just like we were another table during his work night.
Thank you Flemings for such a great evening....my wife and I will return and definitely request Tom!

I think this place is supernice and contemporary design is great.
There is outdoor seating available and wonderful happy hour so I will be back for that.
I had dinner there last night with my husband and I made the reservation in advance on their website when I checked in for my res the host noticed that I requested a booth however she was not prepared for it so it took a while to get the booth and the bar was packed too after this hick up the service started a bit slow the drinks were coming slow but I have to admit that the food was excellent and our server Eric was on top of his game.
We overall enjoyed our time and I have already forgotten the rocky beginning.
It is a must try!

Happy hour is the place to be.
Seven days a week, from 5pm-7pm, five small plates, five cocktails, five wines by the glass, and two entrees all for $6 a piece.
The best part is that it is honored at the bar and out in the patio.
The spacious amount of seating makes it way easier to dine at this location compared to the original.
Between the three of us we ordered everything except for the salt and pepper shrimp.
At that point, what is another six dollars?
The highlights were definitely the mushroom raviolis, baked brie, and burger.
The beef carpaccio was not the best.
The meat was rather dark and tough compared to the tender bright red I'm used to.The pork belly was very tender and artery clogging.
The polenta and compote was my favorite aspect of the dish.
As for drinks, I will stick with the Ward 8.
Oh yes, browns can be oh so refreshing,   If you can, sit with Stephanie.
She is fun, engaging, and sweet.

Went to Flemings for a friend's birthday.
What really sent a red flag off was the waiter's offhand comment that the menu was a "conventional steak house.
" Now don't get me wrong conventional is good in my book, nothing beats the simplicity of meat and potatoes.
What's wrong is charging luxury prices for food that simply doesn't warrant such a price tag.
I'm fine eating a $50 Steak, but what makes it worth $50?
Is it organic?
Grass Fed?
A new innovation on the greatest meat to ever grace this earth?
Flemings just says it's wet or dry aged, aging beef is a necessity not anything to brag about.
I can cook a beautiful steak from Costco for 8 bucks a pound, Flemings is too expensive at that price.
My friends ordered it, they enjoyed it, from what I sampled it tasted fine.
But $50 fine?
No F****** WAY!
And the steaks were a la carte too, which is just ridiculous, if you're paying $50 for a steak give the customer a baked potato.
The sides (including potatoes) were priced from the $10-$15 range which just stings because now you're certainly paying $60 for your entree.
The sides are marketed as "Family Style" but it'd only give a nice portion split between 3 people.
I ordered the Fleming's Salad ($10) and their New Zealand Lamb Chops ($20), and I'm simply baffled at what I was served.
When I order a "Steakhouse Salad" I expect something of large proportions.
After all a salad with no protein costs a restaurant practically nothing (and none of their food was labeled GMO-Free or Organic).
What I received was a little salad, something that would leave a little girl wanting for more.
To add insult to injury the dressing was too sweet for my tastes, no acids besides what the baby tomatoes would give.
I was pretty buzzed and wolfed it down anyway.
When I ordered Lamb Chops I was alerted by the server that it indeed was a little plate of food, I didn't care because I was not paying $30 for chicken breasts.
It was small but decent, unfortunately it was given to me at room temperature meaning it had been sitting while my friends orders were made.
Come on guys for twenty bucks you can wrap my little chops with some foil!
The meal wasn't all bad, the wine served was great, and I loved the deserts, all complements to pastry chef.
The servers were courteous.
But after being buzzed on wine we were given the ultimate rude awakening with our bill, for a party of 6 our total was around $700 (not including tip).
Now to be fair we ordered $250 worth of drinks.
But still we were NOT given $450 worth of food, no way in hell can steak, potatoes, lamb, and lobster cooked conventionally cost $450.
Now I know what you might be thinking, well this is Sin City, you gamble and spend a lot here.
Well I can take you to "Mon Ami Gabi" at Paris and sit outside with a stunning view of the Bellagio Fountains for far less than the price of going to Flemings.
I can take you to Bouchon and have the most lovely salad, entree, dessert and wine for roughly $100 a person.
Flemings was conventional, there was nothing technically wrong with the food.
But at the end of the day we were horribly overcharged, their only gift was a $25 gift card (which we sadly couldn't apply to the bill) and a small box of chocolate truffles.
Unless you have a 50% off coupon do not go to Flemings, it simply is not worth it and there are far better choices in Las Vegas.
And this is Sin City, why would you want "conventional" in this town?
If you want a real good steakhouse you'll get more bang for your buck at the Steakhouse in Circus Circus.

I came to Fleming's for the first time in January, for a Yelp Elite event.
We all received s $25 gift card, and I noticed about a week ago that it expired at the end of this month.
We tried to come out on the weekend, on Saturday evening, but the car broke down.
I was so bummed.
Yesterday, after work, the fella and I decided to head over for Fleming's Happy Hour, which is from 5-7.
We were greeted, and invited to sit anywhere at the bar.
Kristen was our bartender, and she took excellent care of us.
We ordered everything from the "5-6-7" menu (5 offerings of cocktails, appetizers, etc for $6 til 7):  2 Skinny Farmer's Daughter cocktails:  delicious.
I actually might prefer these to the Original Farmer's Daughter cocktails we had tried before (the skinny ones don't have simple syrup)  The Pan Crisped Pork Belly: This was interesting.
It was my first time having pork belly, and the texture is VERY weird...but it was rich, and delicious, and the creamy goat cheese grits, and sweet onion chutney that it was served with were absolutely perfect.
The Salt and Pepper Shrimp: This was a disappointment, as the shrimp are fried, almost like a tempura.
According to my fella, its fairly common knowledge that if something says "Salt and Pepper" that it is deep fried.
I didn't know that or I would not have ordered it.
That disappointment aside, the green beans were delicious, and the shrimp were huge.
The flavor was awesome, I just would have been happier with not deep fried.
The winner of the night, however, was the Beef Carpaccio.
I LOVE carpaccio, but haven't had it in years.
Luckily, they were willing to serve it without the creamy sauce that they usually serve over it (fella doesn't care for creamy sauces, especially mayo based ones).
The beef was so thin, and was served with a garlic crustini that was just heaven.
The capers, basil, and horseradish made for a delightful explosion of flavor in every bite.
Service was awesome, as Kristin was very friendly, and the food runners were nice as well.
I'd love to come back for dinner one night, to try out the steaks!
Great job, Fleming's, I can't wait to come back.

Had dinner tonight our waiter Erik was incredible!!!
Not only he spells his name like mine but he was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and the wines.
The wine he recommended was outstanding!!
I work for SolarCity and only been here for work dinners and I can see why we keep coming!
Take care of Erik and give him a raise or I'll come steal him from you and he'll be working for SolarCity!
He is amazing!

Came in around 5pm and sat at one of the high top bar tables for happy hour!
I have always raved about Flemings happy hour to my girlfriend and couldn't wait to take her.
We sat down and the service was 5 stars as always.
I'm giving this review 3 stars for the simple fact that the food was not up to par this time.
We got the mushroom ravioli, the prime burger, and salt an pepper shrimp.
The burger was over cooked and dry and we had to douse it in ketchup just to make it edible.
The salt and pepper shrimp seemed tasteless and I had to add extra salt on my own to give It more flavor.
The only thing we both enjoyed was the mushroom ravioli.
This was my first time to this location as I usually go to the Flemings in summerlin and will probably stick to that one even though this location is closer to my house.

I HATE having to give Flemings 2 stars.
That being said... On my 4th lifetime visit to a Flemings... 2 was all it deserved.
And it got those two because of our server who was great.
Today is my wife's bday.
We're also celebrating an Anniv and a graduation.
We both ordered a Cesar salad, the she had a filet with scallops and mashed.
I had a main filet with Flemings potatoes.
Both of us ordered medium.
Warm, pink middle.
We cut into our steaks and no oink to be seen.
Just dark meat.
Purplish?
We showed our waiter and he used the food back to the chef who prepared new steaks.
This time her was so underdone it looked like sushi.
That was sent back as well for a quick Tod's in the broiler which ended up making it tough and chewy.
I've Lay's been blow  away by how good the steaks are here.
This time they seemed very under seasoned as well.
And to be perfectly honest..
I don't think the meat was right.
I don't know if it was going bad, or improperly aged, or just plain bad.
But what I do know is it wasn't right.
35+yrs of eating and making steaks....
I know what medium should be.
What it should be is what I got on the last 3 times I was there.
I also watched two other tables by us send back their steaks as well!
I'm disappointed.
The manager ( I believe)  came by and checked on us at one point.
She was super nice.
My wife at this point was embarrassed .
the lady did try to make things better.
A short time later our waiter brought the check full price bit brought my bday girl a few chocolates and  25 gift certificate for next time.
Good late effort...
But I left Flemings hungry and disappointed.
I never thought that would happen

Been to this location twice.
The service is top notch and everyone is extremely friends from the hostess, to the waitress, to the manager that walks around a greets all the tables.
My first meal I wasn't overly impressed, my own fault probably.
I get the peppercorn steak and just wasn't thrilled with the overload of real, whole peppercorns covering the steak.
My second visit I couldn't have been happier with the evening.
The calamari appetizer is by far the best calamari dish I have ever had.
The pre dinner bread with the sun dried tomato spread is awesome.
I went for a dry aged NY strip and it was fantastic.
This place also knows how to pour a drink.
My drink of choice, vodka on the rocks - it's a full glass of vodka, no space for mixers.
Just the way I like it.
We'll done Flemings.

Great small plates!
Plenty of food for my husband and I with 2 small plates, one side, and appetizer.
Yummy blue cheese butter to start with bread.

"Happy Hour Review"  We have never been here before and decided to try Happy Hour, which is 5-7pm.
What a great experience.
We had Mushroom Ravioli, Sweet Chili Calamari and  Tenderloin Carpaccio.
The food is excellent as was the service.
The menu has wines, cocktails and appetizers at listed at $6 each.
They also have a $20 corkage fee if you want to bring your own bottle of wine.
Great experience and we will return.

*Happy hour review- came here after reading about happy hours in Vegas and I'm sure glad we did!
The "5 for $6 till 7pm" is available in the bar/lounge area and has outdoor seating available also.
We ordered the fad tired beer ( Sam Adams rebel IPA) 2 for $6, along with the pan seared crispy pork belly, roasted mushroom ravioli, sweet chile calamari and walnut turtle pie for dessert (not on HH menu) the dessert.
While waiting on our appetizers fresh baked bread was served with a Brie Chardonnay butter and a sun-dried tomato butter.
I think I could've ate the bread/better and beer all night.
I also like foods the start with the letter B.
My ranking of appetizers follows: 1.
Mushroom ravioli- portobello and shiitake mushroom in porcini mushroom sauce ( I love me some mushrooms) 2.
Crispy pork belly- served with grits and sweet onion chutney ( when you mix the pork belly with the grits and the chutney all together everything just feels like it will be ok, I try to cut down on my pork intake but with grits and chutney, I didn't feel as guilty) 3.
Sweet chili calamari- ehh it's calamari- I think I'll omit this one next time  *The walnut turtle pie was awesome and I made sure no turtles were harmed in making this pie.
*oh and another thing-a plus for the servers to warn us that HH is ending and asking for last minute orders to input before 7, truly a happy hour.

Watch it people!.
Do not eat fish there!.
I got the WORST food poisoning in my life at that place.
Projectile vomiting among other things is really better not to mention.
So disappointed that in such quality restaurant they are not more careful handling their food items in a better way, considering the prices.

Excellent service, perfect steak have to have aged bone in prime rib...not to mention appetizers sheared pork and crab cakes melt in your mouth

We came to Flemings for our 30th wedding  anniversary after reading a lot of review's on yelp for steak houses in Vegas I kept coming back to this review ... Well let me tell you there was no disappointment in our choosing...  My husband is very hard to please when it comes to steaks as we raise our own grass fed beef he was amazed at how good the flavor,tenderness,of the Bone in Ribeye was I had the Petite Filet which was equally amazing...
Both steaks were cooked to perfection sides were well proportioned...
The service (TJ) was great as well...
I really liked that fact that even though this is a A+ restaurant in my opinion it has a very comfortable feel to it.... One short minus no Coors Light or Oyster's on the half shell...
The Calamari was great as well.... We will defiantly be back......

Excellent meal and service.
We ordered the prime New York strip, a filet, The Flemings potatoes, and creamed spinach.
The wine list was reasonably priced, and all was excellent.
We will return.

This is by far the tiniest Flemings I've been to, and I've only been to 2 others: The other Vegas location and the Newport Beach one.
My complaint with the set up is there's no barricade from the bar and the formal dining area.
With the loud groups in the bar area, your so called quiet night can be ruined.
Plus, they have 2 big TV's mounted on the bar, which can be distracting if you're facing the bar and you keep looking at the hockey game, instead of paying attention to your meal.
Being said that, I made my 7:00 reservation and was seated promptly... but by the door right AND next to the bar!
No thank you!
I wanted a nice quiet dinner, not next to the group of prom or wedding goers who were loud and obnoxious, taking selfies and group pics.
I asked to be seated elsewhere and the hostess said it'll be a bit of a wait.
I'm guessing other people had their table 'ear marked' because I saw a few empty tables she could have seated me at.
We stood by the door thinking it'll be just a few minutes.
We should have moved to the bar, if we had known the wait would have been 45 minutes longer.
Other couples came in and not once did the hostess offer them the "crummy" table.
I wonder why they offered it to me??
Maybe because I was getting $40 off my $100 meal offer that gave me a crummy table??
At 8:00 we get seated at a MUCH nicer circlular booth and our server was very friendly.
She never asked if we dined at Flemings and started telling us how to use the iPod for wine, and also assumed I must rarely eat red meat, as she told us how the dry aged steaks were better than the other aged steaks.
Stephen and I decided to share a steak, so we each ordered a starter, he got the Wedge Salad, I got the Shrimp Cocktail, then we ordered a NY Strip to share, and 2 sides: The Signature Onion Rings, and the Garlic Mashed.
The food was delicious, and they got 4 stars but quite honestly I think 3 stars could suffice.
Thankfully I got my gift card at Costco ($100 card for $79.99) and with the discount from the email ($40 off the bill if you spend $100) our $121 meal came to $81!
That's the best way to eat at Flemings!
PLENTY of free parking, so I don't know why people would valet it.. but I guess if you want to impress your date, go for it.
Its only 10 less steps than where I parked.

I still don't understand why people write good reviews for such cheap produce/meats.
Terrible cheap farm raised salmon and corn fed (ie chock full of hormones) beef.
Low quality all the way.

Had lunch last week at the town square location.
Bartenders were wonderful and made fresh drinks every time.
We ordered 6 different meals off the happy hour menu.
Everything was great especially for the hh price

Best Happy Hour deal from any restaurant in town!!!
Great menu selections and served perfect every time.
Ward 8 is my favorite bourbon drink on the menu and the wine selection is perfect.
Their wine pad helped me choose a perfect wine for my steak.
Love this place for any occasion!

My boyfriend and I often visit Flemings!
We absolutely LOVE the happy hour!
Their happy is nightly until 7p!
They have drink specials, and great appetizers to choose from.
I always order a Debonair Martini extra dirty with blue cheese olives, and my boyfriend goes for jack on the rocks.
We have tried all of the happy hour appetizers (there are five to choose from for $5 each!
) We really enjoy the tenderloin carpaccio, baked brie, and sweet chile calamari.
And be sure to order the bread basket- fresh baked bread served with both a gorgonzola chardonnay butter and a sun-dried tomato butter.

They had a special on their Prime Rib.
Salad, side dish, Prime Rib & dessert for $29.95.
Pretty good deal?
Everything was good except the Prime Rib and the sometimes  service.
No matter how you ordered it, well to medium rare, you got the same old piece of GRAY meat with zero taste.
We had to ask the server, there were several helping the table to bring knives after they had been removed from the salad and Prime Rib was delivered, we had to ask for the 3 dipping sauces to be sent to the table and it's a small thing but when the server set down the chilled fork for the salad he set it upside down with tines toward the guest.
Maybe Mom never taught him how to set a table.
Been here two other times and the burgers and steaks were pretty good.

What can I say about this place .
Food is amazing .
From appetizer all the way to the deserts .
I brought my parents here for their anniversary and they loved it .
I highly recommend this place .

We came here for dinner and the food was excellent!
All of our steaks and fish were cooked perfectly!
BUT the service was very slow...we waited a little over an hour for our food.
Since we were celebrating my grandpa's birthday, they gave him a box of truffles and a $25 gift card.
Food rating= 4.5  Service rating=3

Great Filet Mignon!
A bit pricey & the service is very slow.

The dry aged ribeye is amazing and the Chipotle cheddar mac and cheese!

excellent!!!!!
