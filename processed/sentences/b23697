I have been getting my hair cut here for over a year and I couldn't ask for a better Barber  anywhere!
Aron is great and you should give him a try!

If we lived here, we would be new clients!
Well, my boyfriend would.
He couldn't stop raving about his cut and the hot towel!
His hair did look good and he was impressed with the straight razor used on the back of his neck.
Nice place.

Great place to find a barber!

Aron is one of the best.
First, he does a great job with cutting my hair on a regular basis.
The best part about Aron though is comfort is very important to him.
He will make sure you are relaxed, with a good station on TV, hot towel, and a massage.
And his prices are very fair.
I once had him do a full shave.
That was truly a treat and very relaxing and he did a great job.
Must try this guy!
