Do not come here!
This place is not even worth a star!
After calling to verify all my garments were ready (cleaned and altered) they said they were.
When I got there to pick them up on my way out of town they could not find the ticket or my clothes!
After 30 mins workers gave excuses and ultimately lied because they were not even there!
He finally told me that it was going to take another day which is worthless to me because I had to leave out of town with out my clothes!
Don't trust!

Horrible service!!!
There customer service is really bad!

$2.50 dry clean fast!
