It's hard to find a shredding place that will take your personal documents at any time.
But these guys do - and for cheap!
$6-8 for a huge bag.
Staff was incredibly helpful and charming.
and when I dropped stuff off, the guy who took my bags asked if I wanted to watch it get shredded.
Not only is it just fun to watch - but I now have no worries that anyone there is looking through my stuff while it's waiting to be shredded.

Had 23lbs of paper to shred from cleaning out some filing cabinets.
They shredded it right there on the spot.
I paid $6 for what would be equal to 1 banker's box (according to their website)  I had it in a department store bag, which they even handed back to me.
Supper easy.
Glad I did it.
The local USP store said they would charge me $1.50 / lb so I saved at least $20 going to PDShred.

This place is awesome!
I had a really hard time finding a place in the East Valley that did confidential, secure shredding of personal documents.
I am so happy I found PdShred - they were friendly, courteous, informative, inexpensive and available without an appointment.
Plus you can watch to make sure your docs are shredded!
I had 3 banker's boxes - $6.00 each - perfect for safe destruction of personal information.
And they recycle what has been shredded.
I cannot recommend them enough.

I use them a few times a year.
They have moved around a little between Tempe and Mesa.
Each time I have use their services I have been very well pleased.
I'm getting ready to use them again in a few weeks I'm expecting great service.
