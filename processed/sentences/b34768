When in the mood for food for my soul this is the place to go.
The rice is absolutely fantastic and eaten with the shrimp makes it a satisfying meal.
I definitely would recommend everyone to try this!

The tilapia, shrimp and rice were all amazing.
Great flavor, nothing overdone.
Just darn good food.

This place is awesome.
Great food.
Particularly the chicken and waffles.
Everything I've had is very tasty but hard to stray from the chicken and waffles.
Eat here every time I come back to Vegas.
