My husband initially found Rita's by doing an online search when he needed to have a suit altered.
Rita said the jacket was fine and just hemmed the pants.
The turnaround was quick and the cost seemed reasonable.
It was several months later when my husband started wearing the suit that I realized the jacket really could have used some tailoring too.
In the meantime I'd called to see if I could take in a few items of my own.
I was told to check back in a few weeks after prom season when she wouldn't be so busy.
I went in a few weeks later with a designer dress and a skirt.
I showed Rita how the shoulders needed to be taken up on the dress (I'm short) and the waist needed to be taken in to make it fit.
She pinned the waist part but didn't feel the shoulders needed to be fixed, and I figured she's the 'expert', she must know what she's doing, so I didn't fight it.
(Big mistake.
)  I also paid to have the back slit sewn up a few inches.
At the same time I dropped off a skirt to have the waist taken in.
When I went to pick up the dress, the back slit still wasn't sewn up (she'd forgotten about that, so she hurried and sewed it up right then and there).
I also realized how strange the dress now looked with just the side seams taken in because it was still too large on top.
AND I still need to stitch up more of the back slit myself because it's still too high.
I realize I should have pointed out the problems and given her the chance to make it right, but if she didn't notice them, perhaps she's just not that great at alterations.
Lesson learned.

Rita is awesome at what she does.
I thought my wedding dress was hopeless cause the bodice was all wrong for my chest and just covered in beading, she made it perfectly fit and fixed the beadin that had been ripped out before arrival.
All and all I am super happy with the outcome, and Rita.

Pretty sure Rita is my fairy godmother!!!
I received a dress from MN for a wedding I am flying back to MN for in seriously a week... Low and behold the bust doesn't fit at all.
I went to another 'alterations' shop and they said it was impossible to fix and they couldn't so anything.
Knowing this couldn't be true I found Rita!
Took my dress in today on my lunch break.. A lot needs to be done *** bust taken out... Waist taken in... Straps remover... And shortened by about 6"*** so this was at 1 I went back after work at 5 she had let out the bust fixing the waist as we speak and fixing the rest... Needless to say I go in for a fitting Friday after work and she's sure it will be done and ready!
I am so relived!
It was oober stressful.
She's the sweetest lady ever to!
Miracle worker I tell you!
***all my alterations while living here in az will be done by Rita!

Rita did a great job on my wedding dress and my bridesmaid's dresses.
She almost cried when I told her I wanted to cut the train, and asked me about 10 times if I was sure, but in the end she made the dress exactly what I had pictured in my head and I loved it!!
Rita is super quick too!
My MOH was pregnant for the wedding so Rita told her to come back a few days before the date and she would do the alterations overnight so the dress would be a perfect fit!
Great service!
A few things to know before you go, no deal breakers, just helpful information.
1) CASH ONLY!
Pay when you pick up.
2) She doesn't take appointments so you might get right it or you might have a few people ahead of you.
If that happens, just go grab a bite at the restaurant next door and come back.
3) The place is kind of small and only has one dressing room.
I think is she planning on moving to a bigger location, so I will need to update my review when that happens.
4) Move away from the door after you walk in.
There is a motion detector that sets off a doorbell sound that does not stop until you get out of the way.
Overall, Rita did a fantastic job and I would trust her with any major alteration in the future.

I went to Rita to have my dress altered and it was an absolute nightmare.
Initially I was told that she would be able to fix the rouching on my dress and that "everything would be fine".
I went back into my next fitting and started to sob once I got my gown on.
Nothing fit right and everything that I asked to be done was done the opposite.
Were I needed it taken in, it was taken out and vice versa.
My perfect dress was ruined.
I brought up my concerns and was told to "just lose some weight and it'll fit fine".
Rude, illogical and poor business etiquette.
After bringing it home, I noticed that there were beading missing with over 5 that were critical to the design dress.
When I brought it back I was told that they were never there and she wouldn't have the beads, but she'll fix it.
I am confident that every bead was on that dress and not only me, but my bridesmaid, mother and individual that sold me my dress looked over the dress.
The only saving grace was that my grandmother flew in a few days early and is a seamstress.
She was appalled that I spent the money I did, only to have it ruined.
Don't waste your time with the run around!

Rita altered my wedding dress for me.
It was about 10-12 sizes too large and she did a fabulous job!
It looks stunning and she did everything exactly as I wanted it.
She definitely knows what she is talking about.
She has a customer for life out of me.
I will take any garment I need altered to her.
She's a sweetheart.
I definitely recommend her.

She was leaving to her vacation (within a few hours), but fixed my two pants in two hours.
Awesome!
Thank you Rita.

Excellent service!!!
Rita is the best!
Great job, affordable prices and the best attention ever!!

came in and had a tux altered (pants, vest and jacket) a week before a wedding and Rita had it done in 3 days.
she did everything exactly how it looked on a picture that the bride and groom requested.
really nice lady, easy to talk to and charges a fair price for the work.

Oh my gosh, Rita was fantastic!
I needed a couple pairs of pants hemmed for a business trip and she took care of me...hemmed them perfectly and did it for a very competitive price.
Thank you Rita

I always say that Rita is like my own personal fairy godmother (which is funny that another review thinks that too!
) Every time I walk through her door and put a dress on, she makes me feel gorgeous.
Not only do her dresses fit like a glove, she will go on and on about how beautiful you are (which is necessary when you are standing in front of a mirror staring and poking at yourself) She even once worked overnight, and stayed open past hours in order for a fellow bridesmaid in a wedding to get her dress fixed.
Hers got so botched from going to someone else that she didn't even have enough room to walk in it.
Rita didnt even hesitate to wait for her to get there and had it ready in the morning.
Never go to anyone else.
Rita is AMAZING and also has GREAT prices.

Rita is absolutely amazing!!
She saved us in a pinch, in a very short time-frame for my daughter's prom dress.
It seems as if she works through the night like a tireless little elf to get everything done and obviously takes great pride in her business.
Her prices are reasonable and her work is impeccable.
She has gained a lifetime client in me.
I love this woman!
