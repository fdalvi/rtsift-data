I love this store.
The staff was extremely friendly, and the clothing was impeccable.
They claim to be the only luxury Chinese brand: "the apogee of the Chinese Art of Living and Chinese Creativity.
"  As I have yet to visit China, I'm not sure, but it seems like it.
My only problem was that the clothes were too big for me.
When I first walked in, I immediately thought of the perfect sized clothing for me, but I was mistaken.
Their small would have engulfed me.
I almost felt like I was shopping at Lucky for a little while.
When the guy told me to try it on, it should fit, I couldn't help but hold it up in front of me and look at him like he was on hallucinogens.
Alas...
I know when I visit other cities with their stores, I'm definitely going to hit them up.
Check it out and see what you think.

This place offers up hip Chinese goods with a fresh spin.
The merchandise is cool, especially the cuff links and the wine accessories.
It's worth checking out on your next trip to Las Vegas.
The clothes may be a bit limited in their wearability given their pronounced Asian styling.
The store manager also seemed very eager to make a sale.

i thought i was never going to step into a shanghai tang after my trip to china.
luckily, they opened the vegas store.
the variety of clothes are awesome.
they bring a chinese style to modern and hip clothing.
my favorite items are the mandarin collar polos.
they bring a young attitude to any look.

Extremely pricey for clothing of only moderate quality.
I'd been shopping around the high-end stores all day - Chanel, Prada, Louis Vuitton, etc.
- the prices were in the same range, but quality was sub-par.
Accessory pricing was laughable - key chains (enameled iron or brass, looked like something from a cheap vegas gift shop) were $96.00.
The thin, cardboard-y belts were $350.00.
I'm not fat by any stretch of the imagination - measurements 34 - 25 - 36" - I'm petite and usually wear a dress size 2/4 - size small.
However, the size small belt couldn't even close around my waist.
I know these are chinese sizes, but that really made me feel horrible.
I was afraid to try on any of the clothing out of fear of the sizing woes.
Pros -  The styling of garments - the mix of asian and sporty/contemporary drew me into the shop.
