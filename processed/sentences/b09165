I don't do fast food, but I do Del Taco.
The only thing I ever order is the 1/2 pound bean and cheese burrito, and I'm convinced its the best edible 99 cents out there.
Why?
They use lard-free refried beans.
And that means everything.
I've had bean burritos everywhere, and Del Taco's is the one of the few that doesn't give me stomach discomfort and I'm positive its because of the omission of the lard.
The tortilla quality is decent, too.
You have the option of Red or Green sauce, too... Get the red.
As for the restaurant itself, I'm also happy with the friendliness of the staff as well as the cleanliness of the establishment.
And with the money you save, you can go to RA for happy hour the next day!

I'm generally a fan of Del Taco, but this review is for one thing....
It's 2010, why doesn't Del Taco have established debit/credit card machines in their restaurants?
I know they cost quite a bit to run, but for a prominent fast food restaurant, one would think you could invest in it.
I think it's funny whenever I go through the drive-thru, they have to grab the little machine and hold it out so I can put my pin in...or...as it was a few months ago, they'd have a little notepad for me to sign off my receipt...Ha!
That's still better than the local by Six Flags in Cali where I had to use the atm in the store that translated to the register and gave me cash with a stupid fee.
dumb.
