While I'd weigh 400 lbs (or more) again, I could honestly eat here weekly and be SOOOO happy with life!
The food was decent for the price you pay...and I didn't get sick :-)  ROCK ON!

Jack is the spot for greasy fast food- and sometimes that's all you want!!
Get the chicken strips, and a grip of ranch.
YUM!

Ahhh fast food!
Its all the same!
Well here the food isnt super greasy!!
I love the grilled chicken options they have as well as their breakfast sandwich, but i get it without ham!
The price is ok, you pay for what you get right?
I also like their curly fries!
One weird thing is that they do not give a toy with the kids meals!
Left my son hangin!
Anway I come here when Im in this area.

No complaints- it is your typical J in the B with lots of options and specials.
Friendly service, although the drive thru was pretty slow.
I sampled my fries before I left and mentioned they were a little cold, so they gave me some fresh, hot fries and didn't want the old ones back.
They never have a problem giving you extra sauces or anything like that, either.

Closest Jack's to my place.
Like coming here since they offer 10% off.
Decent deal to grab a burger or some tacos.
It's fast food so not much to say.
Just trying to get a bang for my buck.
Service is great and the place is clean.
Parking is easy since it's a big lot.

Ok guys, this is a fast food joint!
So rating it like its red lobster isn't fair.
They are always clean, there's good parking, and I haven't experienced long wait times.....but again..... it is fast food, so if you go at 12pm then c'mon!!!!!!
I gave it 4 stars because the order does come out different at times, but the ratio is great.

You guys are great.
I'm here at least 5 times a week and the order is always correct.

This location is always fast and they get the orders right every time.
I have never been shorted an item.
This place is usually very lean and the staff pretty nice.
I love Jack in the Box for one reason and one reason only-- TACOS!!!
They are nasty greasy but OMG good.
Me and the BF love to go here and order like 12 then come home and just stiff our faces.
I have had a chicken sandwich here one time and it was also really good.
I just can't bring myself to get away from these tacos.
2 for .99 is a great deal!

Jumbo Jacks and their milkshakes are the two main reasons for me visiting Jack In The Box.
This has been true since I was in college.
This location is clean, the staff are on the ball, orders are always correct and ready in a reasonable amount of time.
I am a fan, even though I try to cut back on fast food chains in general.
