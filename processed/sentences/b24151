Very good for a family restaurant type diner.
They make you feel welcome and you can linger.
I am from Chicago and it definitely reminds me of the comfortable family restaurants there.

Tried this for the first time this past weekend, reminded my wife and me of upstate NY diners.
We ate there around noon, so two of us had lunch, one breakfast.
The waiter was super nice, told us we could order anything on the menu anytime.
The food was excellent, real mom and pop feel.
My wife's burger had a nice sear on it, Swiss and fresh mushrooms.
I had an excellent club sandwich made with hand carved turkey, good fries.
My daughter had chocolate chip pancakes (good parenting in action), and a side of bacon, of course.
Clean plate club for all three of us.
We'll be back.

This place is a classic 70s style diner.
If you go in between 8:30 - 11 a.m it is full of retirees.
The food is on the heavy side - patty melt on rye, meatloaf, chili, etc.
All well prepared, but you could not eat here every day without becoming the size of a barn.
I find the family running this place a little on the creepy-side.
Friendly, but there mannerisms are just slightly off-center.
All of that said, I chow here once a month.
