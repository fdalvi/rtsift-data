Recipe for success:  A 24 oz.
craft beer on the patio during the summer (Bell's Two Hearted is available and highly recommended)  After one or two, a Peet's coffee to wake you up.
All in a classic, cool building on a beautiful lake in the middle of a great campus.

I can't believe I'm saying this, but it's better than any other coffee I have tasted.

The staff is consistently friendly and really helpful - it's always a pleasure talking to them at the counter.
But, the coffee has been pretty hit and miss in my experience.
Not sure if it's the method or the actual roast/flavor...
I'm more inclined to say it's the latter.
On an unrelated-yet-related note, this is a great place to sit and read/study - Peet's likes to play a fairly solid selection of classical music and there's a decent number of granite-topped tables and outlets nearby.
Not a good place to go if you need lots of room as the tables are individual-sized... go around the corner into the Rathskellar or Paul Bunyan room for that.
