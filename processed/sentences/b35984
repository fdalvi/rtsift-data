I made an account just to review this Starbucks inside Albertsons--that's how bad their service was.
I asked for two very simple drinks, a black sweetened ice tea with and without lemonade, and I never tasted a disgusting Starbucks drink until now.
I will definitely be driving an extra 2 miles to get quality Starbucks at Anthem.

Not so happy campers here...maybe they need to drink some shots or drinks???
2nd time here since it's a pass by location when visiting the family.
The first visit months ago we ordered a coffee and frappe which was not done well.
So I thought it was an off day.
Now, getting a small $25 gift card for part of a birthday gift was a reason to go again.
Machi was fine, shots were strong (was a good thing), but an issue with my Very Berry Hibiscus.
No berries???
and I was told it was for looks.
And when the coffee drinker wanted some half & half, she gets handed a carton of Albertsons.
After a few drinks on the way I gave up.
The berries do make a difference:(  I guess not all Starbucks are not on the same page...especially in Carefree, AZ.
