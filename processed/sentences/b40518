Saw this new shop at Chandler Fashion Center and had to check it out!
What a great shop !
Every imaginable type of balsamic and olive oil.
Tons of yummy dips, spreads, spice mixes, etc.
They have samples throughout the entire shop.
One of the best things is that you don't have to buy a large amount of any given flavor.
The prices start out with 100 ml for around $4-$5.
This is unlike most shops like this.
My experience had been that you have to buy a much larger amount which is obviously more expensive.
It's also nice because you can buy smaller amounts of several different flavor sand not break the bank.
They have bottles you can buy in the shop or you can bring your own bottles into the store.
These are some of the friendliest employees that I've experienced in a long time.
They are engaging, interactive and full of knowledge about what they are selling.
Many of the items would be great to have on hand to use as hostess gifts or birthday gifts.
I'm already thinking sticking stuffers!
I'm a fan!

really cool store, like a candy shop.. some of the employees are super helpful and knowledgeable and other employees goof around throwing stuff to each other and dropping merchandise on the ground and laughing about it and can't/don't answer any questions.. but 5 stars because of the quality of the oils and vinegars and the handful of employees that do try hard

Walked out w/ a $14 bottle of balsamic vinegar & could not be happier.
Should have brought in my own pretty bottle so I could avoid paying $2 for their cheapest bottle but that's ok.
I enjoyed tasting a lot of different flavors I probably wouldn't have else where.
Also learned a lot about vinegar.
I'll definitely come back with my empty bottle.
