Your typical Wendy's.
The servers here are friendly and the restaurant is clean.
My burger came perfectly assembled!
Staff was a bit flustered behind the counter but I did get my meal in minutes as promised.
And with a smile too :-) Awesome!

Pretty regular Wendy's.
Always order here, either drive thru or restaurant service is fast, orderly.
Place is clean, never had a problem with my orders.

food is good, quick delivery, good price.
was able to sit and relax while eating my food.
Cashiers were friendly and brought me my food within minutes of ordering which was good.
