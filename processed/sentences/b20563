This is a suprsingly good kebab shop on Dalkeith Road which offers tasty food at good prices.
I say suprsisingly good because it looks like a printing office or something from the outside and even sounds like it.
Inside, however, the service is friendly and there are some great smells coming from the good quality meat they have turning on the skewars.
I went for a chicken kebab which was piled high with juicy (and only slightly greasy) meat and plenty of salad.
This, along with a can of coke, came to about £4 which was a reasonable price for a filling meal.
They also serve a doner with fries and a drink for a fiver which is a pretty good deal.
Bodrum Express serves great, value for money food which is ideal for a quick dinner.

I must have walked past here numerous times in the last few years but last Saturday the need for a kebab overcame me so I ventured in.
Service was good and quick and I got a large doner with free chips for £5.
The kebab and trimmings were all good quality and there was enough food to leave half for breakfast the next day so no complaints there.

This was my first time in a Scottish Chippy, and this was great.
Taking a glance at their menu - they had a huge menu with a variety of cuisines - haggis, fish, pizza, spring rolls, kebabs... and if you are looking for something deep fried it is likely that they have it.
Service was friendly and fast, prices were very reasonable.
