VERY knowledgeable staff, and Dr. Dameron was very gentle with my shot.
I would highly recommend!
Great bedside manner!

I've been coming to this practice since we moved to the Valley in 1990 and the doctor before Dr. Dameron took great care of my teeth and Dr. Dameron takes just as great care.
I have a small mouth and he's very considerate, especially when performing procedures.
His staff of hygienists and assistants are very nice and pleasant to deal with.
I would recommend this office to anyone in the Phoenix area looking for a dentist.

This practice is great at everything: till they get your money, then GOOD LUCK!
Refused to reline my denture unless I paid almost $800.00 and it was WITHIN THE SIX MONTH time period as stated in treatment plan.
Letter and phone call got me nowhere.
Proceed with caution and hold back a little $ if you can or you may NOT get what you need or paid for!!!
!......still walking around with NO top teeth two years later!!!
Thanks  for nothing!

Dr. Dameron and his team are top notch, had a filling fall out and I was worried I would need a full crown and/or root canal.
Dr. Dameron quickly diagnosed the situation and they were able to squeeze me in and I got the new filling put in completely pain free  in about an hour.
Fixed up good as new!
I would highly recommend Dr. Dameron for any of your dental needs

Team Dameron is great!
Great staff and they keep things simple, which I enjoy.

I have been using DR. Dameron for over 10 years and although my main residence is in Los Angeles, I always arrange my dental appointments around my travel schedule Professional and pleasant, it always - well nearly...- a pleasure to be taken care of by Dr. Dameron and Team They recently added the Oral ID Cancer screening, easy and fast Thank you!
