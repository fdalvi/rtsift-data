This Zorba's is in the same shopping center as Putsy's Chicken & Steak and Picazzo Pizza.
I have been meaning to try this for awhile and finally got to... they were advertising new sandwiches on their menu so I decided to try one.
I decided on the Chicken & Brie sandwich which came with a side salad and I got a iced tea.
The sandwich was very good the iced tea was a little bitter.
I will admit my choice was not very Greek or Mediterranean at all but still yummy.
I plan on coming back to try more items on their menu... it was not pricey so a good place to add to my regular lunch rotation.

We went there for lunch a little while ago.
Place looked like they JUST moved in but we asked and they been there for over a year.
We order some gyros and i was unplesantly surprised to see that meet is coming gout of the fridge and being thrown on the grill as little flat patties.
Bleah how non traditional and fake.
It tasted alright at the end.
But just barely.
I am not going to be back to the place, its just way too "Fake".
"Very Nice!
NOT!!!
