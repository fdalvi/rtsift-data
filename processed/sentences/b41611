A Denny's with a five star review?
Yup.
The staff really works hard to please and the food is really good.
This is not my first Denny's meal.
But when the staff really cares it makes a huge difference!

3.5 stars seems a little more appropriate.
Service was ok, nothing great as we waited awhile between refills.
Food was good other than the turkey bacon, which was not hot and very limp.
Place is clean with friendly staff and the menu has something for everyone.
One of the better versions of Denny's.

That 1 star is for the female manager on 6/21/14 at 5:30pm.
We went in and she said the wait time for food was 40 minutes encoring us to leave, we stayed because we want to eat, after that she told the server that we were not in hurry.
Really?
She was making it seem as we should leave, what manager is so unfriendly and suggest to leave?
