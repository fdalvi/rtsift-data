I will DEFINITELY be using Momentum Carpet Care again!!!
Not only was their quote less than the company I used to use, but they did a much better job!
The guys that came were well dressed and funny.
They were quick and my carpets look AMAZING!!!
Thank you!

This company is amazing!
When we returned from vacation, we had multiple rooms that reeked of cat and dog urine.
Momentum was very flexible and able to do a same day appointment.
Within hours, they arrived, treated the stains and cleaned our carpets.
The smell was gone and the carpets looked like new.
Kamil (the owner) is professional, very knowledgable and took the time to answer our questions and explain his proces.
Their price was reasonable and we will definitely use them in the future!

They did a magnificent job.
My carpet was almost black and now it looks brand new again and all of that for a great price!
I highly recommend this company!
