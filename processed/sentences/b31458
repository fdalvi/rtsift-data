I attended a wedding at the Overlook Pavilion and it was absolutely breathtaking.
The desert views were outstanding.
The service was great and the catered food was very good as well.
I don't have too many details about this club but from what I have experienced with the aesthetics of the venue, the views of the valley, the service and quality and taste of food I would recommend it for any special function.

I played this golf course for the first time last week.
I am very impressed.
So far, it's one of my favorite golf course in Arizona.
Here's why:  + The course is kept in great shape.
Fairways, excellent and the greens were soft and rolled true.

+ I love the rolling hills and changes in elevation.

The course is located in Fountain Hills, so it's pretty amazing.

Return Factor - 95%

Challenging layout.
Beautiful lanscape.
Well maintained.
My favorite course.
Plan to return.

Great Course with amazing view of the best of what AZ offers.
Loved the design of the course and will play here again for sure.
Tip: Keep it straight!
Target golf on this course, which I love.

What a great day!
The course was in excellent shape.
A bit of a hike even with a cart.
They had 90* rule in effect and the green seemed to always be in a valley.
Tough track but playable.
It should be on your playlist

The view was phenomenal & the really dirty Martinis were flowing!
A great, local kick back place to enjoy the sunset!
