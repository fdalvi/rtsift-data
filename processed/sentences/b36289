I was looking for a place to get my Yearly Exam done, and My sister had visited this place.
I decided to make an appointment and they offered Same day or Next Day appointments, so if you are looking to be see ASAP, they will accommodate!
I was very pleased with the way I was treated over the phone.
I scheduled an appointment for the following week, with no problem.
Wow The place is Beautiful, from Cleanliness to Decor I was just so impressed.
You are greeted as soon as you step inside, and the attention is on you, You really feel Special here :D  I got to see Lisa!
She was Professional and very Knowledgable in what she is an Expert at.
She was very patient, and I felt very comfortable with her.
She is young and confident in answering all your questions.
I Loved it here!
The whole experience from getting there to leaving was Amazing, the entire staff is on Point!
Very Happy Patient here!

I searched everywhere and happy to say I came back and ended up going to this facility.
They truly love what they do and are very respectful.
I saw Kelly and would recommend her for any gyn needs.
Thanks

Doctors aren't very good here.
We had issues with the billing dept that shouldn't of happened.
Go somewhere else.
