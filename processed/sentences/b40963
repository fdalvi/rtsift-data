Came here for the first time and was recommended by a Buddy of mine.
"Chapo" is the one I dealt with on the phone and gave me directions.
He gave me a quote over the phone and stuck to it.
They got me in right away and got it done quick.
Highly recommended if you need exhaust work.
Will definitely be coming back.

I can't really say how good there work they didn't do anything I had a pretty shitty experience called them a few times ahead they knew I was coming in and what I wanted.
When I got there they were in an argument with another customer but I shrugged it off every body had there bad days but after one hour of sitting and waiting for one person to acknowledge me I left and went and got work done some where else

They did exhaust work on my Pilot.
My wife complained about the exhaust being too loud, they fixed it on the spot and now everything is good to go.
They were always helpful and i'd recommend them just as a friend recommended them to me.
The only down side was the actual facility.
Sure it's an auto shop, and a lot of auto shops out there are a mess but this place didn't really seem to care about appearance but just as long as the work on my truck was on point, i don't really care either.
oh, and the girl working the register is pretty hot ;)  Two thumbs up.
