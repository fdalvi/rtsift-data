My mom had to get her smog check in a hurry and we freaked out when we saw a ton of cars near their entrance.
BUT, they had room and we were in and out of there in less than 10 minutes.
They were friendly, quick and a smog check for $12?
That's damn good!

I am new to Vegas.
I looked up a few places around my area to get my brakes fixed, they were more than helpful.
I returned to get something else repaired a few months later and both times they fixed something unrelated for free.
Such as fuses and the corner of my bumper that was falling off.
I have asked them for advise on things and they have recommended to not get something repaired if it wasn't cost effective.
Very friendly staff.
They also quoted my friend at 1/3 what he was going to pay at a different shop.
Definitely recommend!

Quick, cheap smog check.
Cheapest in the city, actually - and competent, too.
They're even able to quickly adjust carburetors on old cars to get them to pass.
I've used them for the last 2 years of emissions tests on various vehicles and will continue to do so.
Conveniently located in the same parking lot as the best parts shop in Vegas: Charleston Auto Parts!
