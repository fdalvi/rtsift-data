I dont know...This station is okay.
Not great, but okay.
They play too much Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga in my opinon (Why?
This is a hiphop and R&B station, I'm confused.
lol).
The radio hosts are a little annoying sometimes, but overall they are pretty decent DJs.
I think DJ Frannie saved this station from pure wack-ery.
lol  If there was no Frannie then I wouldn't listen.
And J Noise saved the morning show from pure wack-ery.
He's pretty funny.
Krazy Kat should stop being so controlling and mean to J Noise, you can tell he's scared of her.
lol

I miss Mike P. The morning show hasn't been the same without him...so I don't listen.

I really despise this radio station and I think I speak for everyone else.
First off, they play the same ol pop music on rotation.
Hip hop and r&b?
What a joke of selection they play.
I like rap and r&b but I  would like this station even more if they showed a bit more creativity  for example, it wouldn't hurt to hire some skilled djs that mixed live on the air.
I don't mean by playing a mix of random songs but by truly mixing and scratching.
Theyre current dj's suck in my opinion.
975 would gain so many listeners if this was done.
Also, they like to follow other radio stations by playing the same old music.
Please show some creativity and be bold, do not follow.
