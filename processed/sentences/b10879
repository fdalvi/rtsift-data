Barcelona is more of a bar that serves tapas than a tapas bar.
We received a complimentary plate of grilled bread, hummus and an addictive, spicy, garlic cream spread.
Our first order was  pan fried dates stuffed with almonds and wrapped in bacon with a wine reduction sauce (3.5 stars) and quesa fundido, baked cheese in a roasted pepper and tomato sauce (2.5 stars).
We then shared an order of paella which was mediocre due to the absence of saffron, a good seafood broth and chorizo (2 stars).
The meal was concluded with delicious flan (4 stars).

Frank...
It's not a bar if there is no poker machines... (The Dive Bar excluded.
Barcelona is a great hidden spot in Vegas.
It's relaxed, and the sangria is great.
Once in after a couple times, the staff knows you by name, and  the food is nothing but amazing.
It's great to have such quality in the neighborhood.

The worse Paella I have ever tasted.
The rice was soggy, no trace of saffron and a very strong fish flavor.
The bacon wrapped dates were decent 3.5 stars.
Our waiter appeared depressed, didn't smile or engage us until the very end (tip time).
I notice they have this poor girl standing at 7 am at the corner of Cactus and Dean Martin waving a sign to join them for Happy Hour.
This wouldn't be necessary if they improve the quality of their food.
