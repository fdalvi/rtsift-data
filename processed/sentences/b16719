just tried to get them to pick me up as Circus Circus, they needed to know the address before they could get here.
Is this place a total joke?
forget it.

Took a ride from MGM to LV hilton to meet up for drinks....and i must say that i had the most ridiculous taxi driver ever!!
This Russian immigrant drove like a mad man on Koval lane and the other back streets.
He was seriously driving like 65mph on this little street!!
He almost hit another cab driver and honked nearly all the way to LV hilton!!
He didn't speak much but when i was startled and yelled, he just turned over and said "ZORRY avout my drriving" LOL.
He reminds me of the movie Rocky 4.
My name is Ivan Drago....I must brreak you!
"  Crazy ride...made my day!

Called to inquire about the rates, was put on hold for about 30mins and when this lady finally answered, I asked her and she answered very rudely with a scoff.
I could make out what she was saying because she was eating her words so I asked her if she could please repeat what she said but she suddenly hung up.

I was asked for an address for the pickup, but since I was from out of town, I was only able to provide a business name and the cross streets.
After I told this to the operator, she immediately hung up.
Unacceptable.
