Can you say black velvet Armani jacket for under $70?
I've been consigning and shopping at Regal Rags for years.
Whenever I get compliments on my outfits from RR (happens a lot), I love to say, "It's free!!
"  (or at least feels that way when you have credit on account from what you've consigned).
So if you look in your closet and don't have anything to wear, clean it out, consign the clothes, and start shopping.
You'll find fabulous buys on amazing clothes and you won't worry about showing up dressed like someone else who just shopped at the mall.

I have known the owner Lizz Burnette for years and she is amazing!
The clothing you will find here is exceptional.
Examples: Jimmy Choo shoes, Channel, Henri Bendel, St. John's, Furs and Coats or all labels, Louis Vuitton, boutique labels, labels sold at department stores, vintage and one of kind finds.
The prices have a wide range but she has amazing sales for 50%-90% off.
The parking lot sales held a few times a year are when you can find things for great prices.
She is an exceptional lady as well since she rescues animals, is a great business woman(17 years owned Regal Rags), and hires only great people to work for her.
She excepts clothing that is gently used of all seasons at anytime.
If you are a first time consignor you need 10 items to start your account and later on it is as many as you want.
It is a 60/40 split.
40% you keep.
You can use your money in the store or you can take the money and keep it as you wish!

Regal Rags is a hidden gem!
