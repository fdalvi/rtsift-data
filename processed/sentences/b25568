Thus far, I've had nothing but good service from these guys.
They've gotten me in for oil changes on a moments notice (a far cry from even being able to schedule pre-paid oil changes at Fletcher's) and not only corrected a bad alignment from Fletcher's, but also adjusted to a proper manual setting for better tire wear (at my request).
They've been good every time I've dealt with them and have had no issues with me watching over their shoulders sometimes as they do their work.

My wife had a flat tire when she was in an appointment in Laveen.
A coworker put on the donut spare and I looked up.
Firestone on the website so she could get it replaced instead of driving all the way to Chandler.
She arrived at this store at 5:56 pm.
Their website says they are open until 7 pm, but the workers insist they are only open until 6 pm.
They then told my wife they didn't have time to help her before closing and locking the door at 6:58 pm.
We will only go to our regular location here in Chandler from now on.

Felt a bit ripped off and spent 4 hrs waiting for the work to be done.
Saw at least 7 people come and go after I got there.

One of the employees was kind of rude.
I walked in here expecting that I could get my oil changed same day.
The first question the woman asked me was if I had an appointment?
I said "No.
" This was the only time I have walked into a firestone and they could not give me service same day.
I lived in North Phoenix a couple of months back and they were always able to take me despite living near the metro center mall.
Irony anyone?

Prices weren't nearly as high as I thought they'd be.
Service was slow, but everyone was super nice.
