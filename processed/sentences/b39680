This place is awesome!
We just had them re-tile our whole house!
We are going back to finish our bathroom and kitchen backsplash!
The guy there has been doing tile for over 20 years.
He was very helpful.
They make beautiful custom medallions!
Love this place!

My wife and I needed to redo 2 vanities in our bathroom.
Our problem was that we only needed a few tiles to do the work.
Under 20 for the vanity tops and another handful for the back splashes.
After visiting every large tile store in the area, we stumbled upon Designer Tile.
Between Steve and Cory, we were treated like this was the biggest order they ever got.
The advice, the service and the selection was second to none.
I've even had to order 1 additional backsplash tile and they never even flinched.
They are true professionals and, they care.
We'd never use any other tile store.
Thanks again for all the help and advice!
