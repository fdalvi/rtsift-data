a great place for late night snacks... love the carnasda burrito... like mexican food... is soo good.. it hits the spot..!

Absolutely horrible.
The food is frozen and warmed to order and there just isn't anything that tastes fresh.
Avoid at all costs.

If you want greasy Mexican food, you have come to the right place!
It's so evil in here, yet SO GOOD.
We made it part of our midweek lunch place - almost every week!
And what did we order every damn week!?!
SUPER CARNE ASADA NACHOS!
(no beans)  They definitely do not hold back on the carne asada, which is always good!
The melted cheese (so greasy), sour cream, and pico de gallo create such a perfect harmony with the meat and the crunchy chips.
I just used "perfect harmony" while describing nachos.
I need help.
Just try to ignore the massive amounts of grease towards the bottom of the plate.
It'll make you feel really bad about what you just ate.

Man oh man!
This food always makes me smile and my mouth water before I'm about to dive into it.
I have been here countless times and have yet to be disappointed.
One yelper mentioned that it TB and Del Taco paled in comparison, man was she right on the money!
I love the rolled tacos, all that guac and under 3 bucks; *drools*  The staff is friendly who takes your order and the environment is lax.
I have heard that the food is different depending on which Roberto's you go to, so I'm only speaking for this location.
Come one, come all - you have to check this place out!
Oh, and need I mention, Roberto's = drunk munchies haven!!

I always order Carne Asada Fries or Carnitas Burrito.
The meat is always fresh and yummy.
You also get fresh cucumbers and green onions.
This is my favorite Don Tortaco!
