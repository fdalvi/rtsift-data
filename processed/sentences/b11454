I had to get the little one some new shoes so I knew this place had some nice ones and had to hit it up.
The sales person was super helpful.
She measured his feet and helped me select a couple of pairs for him and each pair she made him walk around and checked the toes.
I was very impressed with her customer service.
I think I might have to say something to her manager..she went above and beyond for us.
I will be back for sure and I will tell all my mommy friends about her.

This kid of mine is growing like crazy!
I swear I spend a fortune on his footwear!
I brought him in to get measured since his shoes were getting a little snug.
They take such good care of me there.
I just love shopping for shoes for him..and he actually likes it as well.
I score two pairs of Sperry's for him..buy one get one pair 50% off!
Score.
I walk out feeling like a good mommy shopping here.. See ya in a few months..after the next growth spurt.

Be wary of the sizing.
I brought my granddaughter in to get a pair of shoes.
She is 3 years old and is currently wearing a size 7.
The store clerk measured her foot and said she should be wearing an 8.5W.
I questioned the difference in size, but she was  positive she measured correctly.
They didn't have her size in stock so I went home and ordered online.
We just got the shoes three days before her 4th birthday and lo and behold the shoes were at least an inch too long.
Do you know what it is like to disappoint a little 4 year old who had her heart set on the cinderella shoes.
I would like to smack that store clerk up the side of the head.
I think they should train their salespeople a lot better.
Really disappointed in the store -- the Las Vegas outlet.
