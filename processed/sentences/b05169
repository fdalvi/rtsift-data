for sure i would not get gas here.
but for slurpees, red box, drinks, nachos, junk food, definitely!
Love the fact that the location is safe, and even in the late hours have never been approached by a stranger asking for bus money.

This store is super clean and the employees are nice!
They have Fresh Brewed Tea!!!
And Chocodiles..those elusive snacks are hard to find but the employee informed they are a regular item!
Wohoo!
