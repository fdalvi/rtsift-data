Don't count on the people in this store to give you complete information.
If they'd listened to me and addressed my needs, I could have saved hundreds of dollars.

Very unhelpful.
The staff did not even attempt to address my needs.

The first time I came in, one of the staff on the floor helped address some of my questions when trying to pick out my new device.
She was helpful and even offered to help me with discounts because I didn't need all of the accessories.
She even helped me sort out some billing questions I had on my shared plan.
For this reason, I am giving them an extra star.
I wish I could remember this one's name.
I went back the next day and was served by Rebecca.
She was unfriendly and never smiled!
She helped me with what I needed, but seemed uninterested in helping me make my purchases.
When it came time to check out, she barely gave me any information in regards to:  1.
What kind of rebate I was getting and how to really go about doing it.
Did not ask if I wanted her to put on my screen protector, decided to do it herself, and didn't even make it straight 3.
Asked me if I wanted insurance but never told me what it included 4.
Did not ask me if I wanted all of the accessories but just assumed I wanted the bundle.
These are just a few of the concerns I had.
I think that if I never asked questions, I would have not learned about any of these things.
I was less than impressed with the customer service I received.
It was so poor that I almost just walked out of the store without buying anything.
She was lucky I already knew what I wanted.
