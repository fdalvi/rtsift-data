I gave one star bc I HAD to.
I have never in my life been to such an unprofessional place in my life.
I'll spare the name of my "stylist" but why, idk.
bottom line is, if you can't cut hair right, don't cut someones hair!!
I'll stick to letting the professionals at Honeycomb Organic Hair Salon  do my cutting from now on.
How hard could it possibly be to trim BANGS?!
THEY'RE ALREADY PARTED SHAPED!
My bangs look disgusting and I'm not going to let that hack job TRY to fix them.
Bs!

Pleasant staff, no real wait time, and conveniently located close to home.
While I fully admit to being high maintenance in some ways I keep my hair a relatively simple process - just follow what is there, keep it even, and charge me less than $20 because whatever is left from President Jackson is your tip.
One star off for forcing me to listen to pop music for 20 minutes, but otherwise not too shabby at all.

Took care of me even though I didn't give them much to go on.
I appreciate the patience every time I'm here.

Just went in for a quick trim.
Waited a couple of minutes for a stylist to be available, but it was early and they had only been open for about 30 minutes when I got there.
I was greeted right when I walked in and they let me know it would be a couple of minutes - so I was fine waiting.
My hair stylist was very friendly and did exactly what I wanted her to do with just trimming off the bottom ends of my hair so that I can grow out the layers I once decided were a good idea.
Overall: A Good for a quick trim and service was friendly!

If I could gives this place 0 stars I would!
Worst experience ever!
Horrible customer service and the lady who cut my hair messed up my bangs so bad!
I can't believe she has a license to cut hair.
Beware of the chola lady with red dike hair!
