I received two dozen roses beautifully boxed from my BF for our anniversary last week.
7 days later 18 of the roses still look great.
the quality and prices of the roses are great.
My BF also said that the owner is super nice and made spending his money a pleasure.

Wow.
This was a bad experience.
I ordered a large bouquet for my mother-in-law's birthday.
I spoke to two people and they both assured me that with the large budget I gave them, they would make a big, beautiful bouquet with a variety of colorful flowers, including some roses.
The flowers were delivered while I was out (my mother-in-law lives with us) so I didn't see them until I arrived back home.
When I walked in and saw this puny, rose-free excuse for a bouquet, I had to immediately apologize to my mother-in-law.
She was very disappointed.
She is used to receiving very beautiful arrangements from us.
We always use the same healthy budget and have never received such junk as we received from Arizona Rose (not!
) Co.  We moved here recently and didn't know who to use, but saw 1 Yelp review that was 5-stars so we were confident that we wouldn't be disappointed.
I called them and asked them to come back and pick up their flowers and give me my money back.
I have placed the same order with another florist and hope we will get what we're used to.
I will be reviewing the other florist tomorrow.
We will not use Arizona Rose Company again.
Ever.

I have placed orders many times with the Arizona Rose Company and have had zero problems.
I get my girlfriend flowers weekly from here and have yet to be let down.
My flowers are consistantly lasting 5-7 days.
The staff is amazing and they have never failed me.
I'm not sure why there's a 1 star, because I've had nothing but the best service and flowers.

Just got my flowers from Arizona Rose Company for Valentine's Day and they were absolutely beautiful.
My girlfriend was head over heel about her arrangement as well.
GO TO THESE GUYS!
