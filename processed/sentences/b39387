Can't believe I'm about to review the post office but... Little tricky to find this location, drove by it a few times.
Had to drop in to pick up the oh-so-dreaded you owe us money letter from Uncle Sam.
Anyways, the staff was extremely friendly, very prompt with their service and overall great!

No one likes going to the Post Office during peak hours, but this location isn't bad!
I stop in here quite a bit because this is where the Business Reply Mail account and permit my work uses was registered.
Got to keep that account balance up because no one likes a collections call or letter!
Kristy C has always been super helpful with our account or anything else I've ever needed.
Everyone else is also very friendly and prompt to serve whatever your mailing needs are.
Kind of hard to find if you don't know where you're going, but otherwise, very convenient location.

I'm the type of customer who is perfectly prepared, everyone else in line is a hot mess.
God bless these patient and always-smiling postal workers!
You are appreciated... :)

I always run in and just use the self-serve station.
As another reviewer stated - so many times everyone in line is an absolute hot mess - so it is just easier for me to just hammer out the transaction on the machine.
