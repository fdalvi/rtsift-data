Such a gem in the hot hell that is Las Vegas!
I used to eat here at least once if not twice a week.
They make these ginormous taco salads with a homemade vinaigrette that I crave all the way over here in SoCal.
Can't speak for much else on the menu since I'm stuck on the salads!
Be warned they are closed on Sundays!

Best Pork Taco salad anywhere.

Closed several years ago.
