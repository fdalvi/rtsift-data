Great sub shop.
Staff are great fun and they are like sandwich artist.
Fast,friendly, cheap,and ohhh so much better than subway.

Clean,fast,good service, nice place,great sammich,

i love me some blimpies.
this location is especially fast, clean, and super friendly.
unfortunately, i went to get my blimpie's on (that didn't come out right) but found a really sad notice taped to the window and the doors locked.
apparently the rent hasn't been paid in a while and the landlord has repossessed the place.
so for now, no more blimpies.
hope they get it together and open the doors again

Yummy subs at a good price.
The former owners were jerks and would always skimp on the food.
The new owners and their employees are friendly, fast, and hook it up.
