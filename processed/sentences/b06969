Everyone here is always sweet.
The brownies are plentiful and super-chocolatey and the cookies are delicious.
I'm told they have great bread, though I've yet to try it.
There are a few tables to sit at if you want to stick around.
Highly recommend this place if you're looking for a good treat.

This is the place to go when you want to buy doughnuts (baked goods) for treats for work and you REALLY want to let your coworkers know that you appreciate them.
Lane's is one of the 2 very best bakeries in the Madison area.
(Clausen's in Middleton would be the only other bakery that I'd consider their peer.
)   Conveniently located on Park Street between West Washington Ave. and Fish Hatchery Rd., with off-street parking (a definite plus) Lane's has terrific baked goods.
(Cookies, pies, cakes, breads, pasteries...
yum!
)  The service is as good (and as important) as the product quality.

Love this place.
One of my favorite bakeries anywhere, and I've been to a lot of them, at least in NY and LA.
The doughnuts are fantastic, as is the cream puffs!
A must is this bread pudding type dessert made with day old doughnuts with an apple crisp topping!
This is definitely a place I'm going to really miss once grad school is over!

Donuts and coffee here are amazing!
Fast friendly service!
Cute little local bakery :)

The staff is really nice, and it is a cute little shop, but OMG flies galore!
Flies crawling all over the doughnuts, flies dive bombing all around the store.
The only thing this place needs to complete it is Jeff Goldblum.

Freaking ridiculous kringle.
YUM!
