2 PACKS OF SMOKES FOR 5$ / VERY CHEAP CARTONS UNDER 30 $!
NW Corner 7th st-Cavecreek rd-Dunlap   I don't work for this smoke shop.
I am a customer.
I was SO impressed with 7th Street Smoke Shop's prices of tobacco and supplies that I felt compelled to spread the word and help grow this great business.
The staff is wonderful!
They are friendly, respectful, and strive to make EVERY customer a HAPPY customer.
So, come check out 7th Street Smoke Shop at 536 E Dunlap Ave, Suite 3, Phoenix, Az 85020.
They have RYO Filling Stations, Cigars, Tobacco, Hookahs, Pipes, etc.
Their hours are Monday through Saturday 9am to 7pm.
You can give them a call at 602-331-7322.
Thanks for hearing what I have to say about this awesome company.

I have to agree: the staff is friendly, the tobacco always fresh and the prices great.
HOWEVER, the shop is small and sometimes feels claustrophobic.
Also, i would prefer background music on the TV for the waiting customers than R-rated comedy; what if I had brought my grandson in with me to buy something??
Other than that, I give them four stars; I have been to several other smoke shops in the north/central valley and this one is the best so far.
Good luck!
Get more machines!

I used to go across town till I found this place.
Good prices,coupon cards,friendly people
