They RECYCLE batteries here!!!!!!
Yes, single use batteries!!!!!
Plus, they'll take your used electronics and recycle them to Strut and Westech.
Other than that amazing and awesome convenience, their batteries are CHEAPER than Walmart and better quality than the big brands (like Energizer).
Plus, the guys who work here are super helpful!
Highly recommend this place!!!!

These guys are awesome!
Had a technical failure with a BMW remote key access and they provided a solution, allowing me to continue my destination.
If it wasn't for them this issue would have cost me HUNDREDS!

LOVE THIS PLACE!!
The guys are nice, they help me out tremendously, and their prices are just right.
Where else can you get your car's auto entry lock checked and installed for less than $5.
