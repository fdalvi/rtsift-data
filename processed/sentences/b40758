I went on a Friday for Reno's Roc n Sol All-Stars JAM.
The jam host,  Reno Renaldo Bellamy, was friendly & professional.
He greeted me as I walked in & made sure I was signed up to play bass & sing.
The house band & jammers were great & supportive.
I was not charged for my sodas & the drinks are cheap.
The food was excellent.
I will be back!

Saturday nights are very chill!
Live house band at 9 and then a cover jam band comes on about 10:30.
Affordable drinks with live entertainment - always a good time.
The bartenders are quick and take care of everyone!

3rd shift crew is always on point Bryan and Matt always good conversation and always ready to pour another!
plus they pay out nicely!
