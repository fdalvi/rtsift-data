Had a decent experience with training.
The trainer was super nice but their computers auto charged my credit card multiple times.
I am still waiting for one more refund.
And I cannot get my trainer or anyone to respond to me for over 4 months now.
Don't put any credit card on file and you should be ok.
If you ask for them to fix it.
Don't expect good treatment.

Thanks Scott and Brian!
I'm in the best shape of my life and the strongest I have ever been.
I've been coming here and they always seem to push me to the next fitness level.
They really care about their client's goals and try really hard to push you to the next level.
Highly recommend this place!!
