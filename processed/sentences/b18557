Goodwill is a great place to take all the useable stuff piling up around your house.
I like this one because the people working the drop off are always really quick and helpful.
They have a huge variety of stuff you never knew you needed.
After you get rid of a carload, you can use the discount coupon on your receipt to pick up the patio furniture someone else didn't need or that Bob Marley T-shirt you didn't expect to find.

I shop Goodwill alot..
This store is fairly new, when it first opened I enjoyed coming to it..its now turned from a upbeat modern looking thrift store.. to a nasty horrible looking one.
alot of their items are overly priced (although I have found some real good items priced way below value- Nearly new Palm Tungston e2 complete with box for only $7.99 is a steal) store is filthy at times  I still will go here to "check" for good deals 2 stars just because you never know what you'll find!

This Goodwill has a ton of stuff.
Its much more organized than others.
The staff here are friendly and kind which always makes for a better thrifty experience.
They have a boatload of clothes and a decent housewares section.
The furniture section is a bit low end but you never know when you might find a gem.
That's the thrill of the thrift store hunt!
I love their bedding and linens section.
They have tons of sheets, blankets, place mats, towels etc.
No, I'm not above using previously owned linens, though I do draw the line at underwear (they have that too).
Everybody has their boundaries and mine is other people's undies, I just can't go there.
As for everything else...why not?
Thrift stores are a great way to recycle other people's old stuff into things that are new to you (and visa versa)!

Love/hate relationship...
Some things are way over priced...
I know it is for a good cause but, 10.00 for a dress?
Used?
Come on!
Also, shoes can be up to 50.00 wtf?
Ive seen fake coaches in these for 90.00...
I know its donations and to help the community but, when I go in there to browse around I think to my self what about the people that come in here because, they are less fourtante?
20.00 jeans!?
20.00 shoes!?
30.00 coffee pots?!?
Come on now...
