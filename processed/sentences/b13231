This was my first condo in Phoenix.
I can honestly say, it was not the best experience in the world.
First, let me preface this by saying the view is gorgeous.
Whether you are facing north or south the view is angelic.
Here is the laundry list of problems:  the doorman is rude, the tenants are loud and some are quite nasty, the valets are not prompt, the tenants steal the decorations (yes, its true), it costs $500 to rent the elevator to move furniture in, it costs $500 to rent the community room, it costs $300 to rent the theater,  the upstairs lounge was closed to tenants for 5 months, etc.
etc.
etc.
Beyond all of this, a tenant decided he was mad at the management company and poured water into the elevators causing them to break down one Saturday night.
The building has 17 floors.
One night the parking deck would not open so no one could come into or leave the condo.
Mushrooms are growing out of the carpet of the 12th floor.
Someone vomited on their balcony then cleaned it by throwing water on it - forcing the vomit onto the floors below her.
These are just some of the problems.
The seal on the deal - my landlord stated that he did not recieve my vacate notice and "retained" my $1050 deposit although the condo was left spotless.
I would never recommend this place.

I've lived here three years in 3 different units but now I own and I can't say I've ever enjoyed living any other place in life better than I love living here!
