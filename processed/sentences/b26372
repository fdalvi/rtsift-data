Dr. Molin & his staff have changed my life for the better!
If anyone in Las Vegas is seeking a sleep doctor, I highly recommend making an appointment at Zeeba Sleep Center.

I was actually surprised when I was diagnosed with sleep apnea, but since I was exhausted most of the time my doctor recommended the test.
I don't snore much, but it still turned out I was severely sleep deprived!
I can't tell you how much better I've felt over the last month since I started using my breathing machine at night (thankfully, it's quiet, but my husband now calls me Darth Vaderette!
) Vanity won't stop me though; my energy level has quadrupled easily.
I feel so much better.
Thanks so much to Dr. Molin and his team.
They were all professional, courteous, and made the process easy.
Thanks again for helping me feel so much better!

Dr Molin and his staff have changed my life!
I was apprehensive about going to a strange place to sleep and have someone watch me sleep, all of that changed about five minutes after I arrived.
The professional staff and family like atmosphere made me feel comfortable right away.
My follow up appointments with Dr. Molin have been extremely pleasant, I have not waited more than ten minutes at any follow up appointment past my scheduled time.
They understand my time is as important as theirs.
Please people don't wait as long as I did to understand what a great nights sleep is like.
Bravo Zeeba
