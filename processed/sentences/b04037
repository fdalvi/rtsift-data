It's odd reviewing a mortuary "Woohoo!
" but I'm compelled to convey how much I appreciated Tempe Mortuary and the service they provide.
My mother's funeral service was personal, touching and the personel professional as well as compassionate.
They are family owned and treat your family member like they would treat one of their family members.

I know this is kind of odd reviewing a Mortuary but I have to say Tempe Mortuary has been the most compassionate, caring place They have treated my family with such respect and love.
Thank you for making this experience very easy on my family and caring for us.
