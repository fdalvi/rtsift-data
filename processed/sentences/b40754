This place is not much to look at but the food is delicious!
They don't have a kids menu and the service is just ok but not bad.
This is our third visit and every time the food has been great.
The egg rolls are very tasty and not greasy.
The crab puffs are yummy but not a lot in them.
The potstickers are not my favorite but my husband liked them.
We always get the orange chicken it's awesome, not too much breading and they give you lots of sauce!
My children love the sweet n sour chicken which is also lightly breaded and has lots of yummy sauce.
We will be back!

We received a flyer/menu on our front door for this place so we decided to give it a shot!
I am so glad we did.
We ordered house lo mein, orange chicken, crab puffs and dumplings.
We were told it would be delivered in 40 minutes.
We heard the doorbell ring in no more than 30 minutes!
The food is awesome.
I highly recommend both the lo mein and orange chicken.
The crab puffs and dumplings are awesome as well!
I would give it 5 stars, but one time we tried the mongolian beef and it was just a little bland.
Try it out!

I had to change this to 5 stars; the quality is consistently awesome, and we never wait more than 20 minutes for our food to arrive when we ask for it to be delivered!
