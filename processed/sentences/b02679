RUDE!
Seriously, this place is near my house so I called for an oil change and the guy said he could do it right then, so I drive down there and go inside...
The guy behind the counter was nothing but rude.
He looked at me like I must be stupid since I'm a girl of course, then spoke to me like a jerk father would scold his 5 year old son.
They also do not offer synthetic oil... oh but if you bring in your own they'll use it.
Lame!
I was so irritated I walked out.
I'll drive a little further for some good service, thanks!

Went in today for a set of tires.The price was close to other shops i went to.
The people i dealt with where fine, they put on the tires, i paid.
people today expect shops to bend over backwards for them, not going to happen.
as they say it is what it is.
if i needed tires i would go back.

very satisfied with them
