I recently lost my dear sweet Emma, a  Rhodesian Ridgeback dog, to cancer.
The ENTIRE staff at Whole Pet were amazingly competent, empathetic, helpful and available to me and Emma during a hard time.
The doctors were knowledgeable and resourceful and explained everything and my options.
I am forever indebted to them for their compassion and hope that anybody who needs help will do themselves a favor and go see these people.
Cheers.

Amazingly compassionate and intelligent staff.
The receptionist knows my name, my dog's name, his allergies and meds, and the staff was so gentle with my dog when he was getting an IV during a serious liver disease scare (which they were able to catch early enough and treat instantly, bringing him from an emaciated lethargic dog to a vibrant, stronger and healthier than EVER guy full of wiggles and love) that my dog just curled up in their lap to nap.
First time we went in was supposed to be a routine check-up that revealed serious disease in my little guy, so what was a check-up turned into a 5-hour-long appointment with IVs.
They set up an exam room entirely for him, got him warm blankets, and kept an eye on him while I ran my boyfriend to work.
The vets and staff are incredibly knowledgeable and kind, give wonderful support, are raw-food friendly (definitely a rarity, unfortumately), and are responsive to all kinds of questions and details.

Great staff, great service, very knowledgeable and considerate.
My three cats and I go here as they were highly recommended by one of my co-workers.
The staff is super friendly and always willing to listen to my questions and concerns.
They also have a specific room just for cats, which is really helpful, and they are always great at making them (and their human!
) comfortable.
I also love that they take the time to explain everything to you and they are not pushy in the least - they outline services that are available and that they recommend, and they give you a choice.
I also love that the staff is knowledgeable about species appropriate pet foods (read: carnivores need meat!
), which is a rarity for vets.
My cats and I are so happy to have found a vet we can trust and I for one am glad to know they will always be in good hands.

Great!
Knowledgeable doctors have taken great care of all my dogs.
They practice modern medicine and offer holistic options which was exactly the balance we were looking for in a vet.

Wonderful staff.
Since I just take my cat in once a year for check-ups, I always have a lot of questions.
The were very patient with me and didn't rush me at all.
I also like that they have a special cat window that I think made the visit a little less stressful for everyone.
They  give all the options for recommended care and aren't pushy at all, unlike other places I've been.

I cannot say enough good things about Whole Pet.
We took our cat here last night.
The vet tech and vet, Erica, were incredibly knowledgeable, helpful and patient.
We have a "problem cat" so we warned them that she could be difficult to wrangle.
They said they had some tricks for that and, amazingly, they worked.
(Feliway, kitty burrito, tapping on the head for distraction.
) They listened to all of our questions and spend a lot of time thoughtfully responding.
They explained how much everything would cost in advance and gave us options.
Full service is what you get here--down to cleaning up the stress poo and pee.
Erica even went so far as to help us clean out the carrier, put it back together, and gently put our cat in.
Unreal!
We have gone to lots of different vets in several states but Whole Pet by far blows everyone else away.

I love Whole Pet Vet!
I recommend them to everyone I know :)

Still love them!
The vets, Megan, Lisa, and Erica are all so nice and very patient.
They make sure all of your questions and concerns are addressed (including everything from grain free dog foods to doggie seat belts!).
The vet techs are all SUPERB!
Overall a very talented, just wonderful group!
I wouldn't take my pup anywhere else.

Really personable.
They listen to you.
Give you lots of options.
Are up front about their pricing.
They understand the benefits of a raw diet and they care about their patients.
I was very very impressed.
As soon as i arrived at Whole Pet, I felt like family.
They treated me and my dogs like I had always gone there.
So glad I found this place!

Wow.
This place is fantastic.
My cat has been ill.
I came here for a second opinion on his diagnosis and care.
Everyone I spoke to from start to finish was kind and helpful.
They ran the tests that were needed and explained not only why they were needed but what the results meant.
After the experience I had today I will be moving all of my pets over to this clinic.
I feel comfortable with the diagnosis, and I feel informed and educated.
Even my cat loved it there!
This is the first time I've ever brought my cat home from the vet and he didn't immediately run and hide!

We have taken our dogs here over the past two years and have had very good experiences with Dr. Erica.
She is exceedingly patient and comes across as quite knowledgeable.
The staff has been very kind to us, allowing us plenty of time on the terrible day when one of our dogs needed to be euthanized (he was 14, but it was "too soon" nonetheless).
Overall, I feel comfortable taking our two pooches to this clinic.
We're usually able to get appointments within a few days of calling or even sooner when there's been a dire situation.
We never have felt rushed during our appointments or like my 1,397 questions are stupid (yeah, I am THAT client...is anyone really surprised?!).
They have always called promptly with test results, even calling an hour and a half after their closing time recently  to give us results we were worried about (now that's dedication to fecal samples!
)  ;)     Finally, the vet tech will usually go over all vaccines/procedures with you prior to the vet coming in and give you a printed quote for each item.
It's nice to know what things cost while you're having the conversation with the vet so you can make informed choices.
All in all, good customer service and kind, knowledgeable staff who don't make you feel rushed - win-win for me!

I just moved here and my cat was due for her yearly checkup, so I called Whole Pet after reading the reviews for it (and some other nearby clinics).
I was impressed right away because they had an appointment available the very next morning and the receptionist was very nice on the phone.
All of the staff was so incredibly kind and made both myself and my kitty feel welcome.
They took plenty of time to explain things, made sure I got estimates of how much not only that day's services would cost but also how much other services I was interested in would be.
My cat also got a free nail trim for free because it was our first visit and they showed me how to do it so I could do it at home.
I have to say I was really quite impressed with this place.
It's clean, smells nice, everyone is very nice and helpful, and I will definitely be continuing to take my cat there.

Brought in my cat for a checkup.
They were super nice and didn't pressure me to get any extra tests that weren't necessary as I'm on a tight budget.
Very reasonable price for the level of service that we got.
I got some good advice about food soft food, and during the exam, my cat was purring so much that they had trouble hearing his heart beat.

I cannot say enough good things about this clinic.
We relocated to Madison from NYC with our 4 cats, two of whom have serious medical conditions, and tried two other veterinary clinics in town before we finally found Whole Pet.
We chose them based on the website, which listed a holistic approach to treatment, and went for a second opinion on one of our cats, who had been diagnosed with kidney disease.
Best decision we ever made!
Whole Pet is staffed by knowledgeable, kind, patient vets and techs.
Everybody there seems to genuinely like animals and I'm convinced the pets know it as much as us owners.
Dr. Caldwell and Dr. Hellestad have provided truly excellent treatment to all our cats, and have gone above and beyond their duty to help us understand treatment options and make informed decisions.
Visits are never, ever rushed, the doctors and the techs always take the time to explain everything, and answer all our questions no matter how busy they might be or how late in the day it is.
They have been able to see our pets on short-notice and always follow up with phone calls to see how they are doing.
Prices are really not bad, and we are always provided with an estimate of cost, which always includes a cheaper options along with a more expensive one.
We have never been pushed to chose the most expensive option, and the focus of care has always been on the pets, never on the money.
We feel so lucky to have found Whole Pet and I'm happy to recommend it.

I took my cat to her first Vet visit, and the vet, Erica,  and her staff were wonderful and friendly.
They didn't try to get me to spend a bunch of money.
I recommend them to everybody.
I'm definitely going back.
