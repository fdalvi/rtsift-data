Juke Box Bandstand was really pleasant to work with.
They are such a big name in the Madison area, so they really know their way around the local venues without much guidance needed from the bridal party or wedding coordinator.
This helps when the bride and groom are swamped with pictures or other last minute details.
They also have been in business for a long time and have a great organizational system for planning out the night's events according to the wishes of the bride and groom.
The price is reasonable.
The music is all online, so you can choose your playlists ahead of time and put music on the "Do not play" list, which they will not play even if guests ask for it.
I think my DJ, Terry, did a good job reading the crowd at my wedding.
I had initially requested a lot of contemporary music, but it was the 80's songs that were drawing the dancers.
He picked up on this right away.
I was also able to negotiate a free hour of music too.

We went with Juke Box Bandstand for our wedding and loved them!
From start to finish Martie was there to answer any and all questions.
When I left a message they would always get back to me right away and when I had questions about picking out songs, ect.
they were always there to help.
At our wedding our DJ, Austin, was wonderful!
He took requests and really watched how the crowd was responding to the songs played.

My wife and I used Juke Box Bandstand as our wedding DJ and they did a great job.
Austin ended up DJ'ing our event and followed all the directions that we had discussed prior to the wedding.
We wanted a DJ who was low key and not over the top and Austin did a great job of fitting that bill.
Would definitely hire again for a event in Madison.
