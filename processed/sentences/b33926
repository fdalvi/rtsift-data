The location is great but need more playing fields, there is 1 woodsball field and 2 speedball fields.
Its a great place to play if you just want to go and play.
The entry fee/air is a little expensive for me but i guess they have to make money somehow.
I do love after a game the referees will wipe off the paint from your mask and clothes.
Great place if you love speedball but A-ok if your more of a woodsball player.
The rental equipment is excellent, no problems when out playing a game.
I think the best day to go is on saturday, more players out to play.
I've been to better playing fields but this one works out great when there really isn't many fields around.
The owners and the people that work there make the place worth going, always so friendly and willing to help whenever needed.
The one owner was nice enough and take my marker in for a week and tried to fix with no charge.
so I like how they always remember who we are and make it very enjoyable.
The owner's wife is just awesome so polite and friendly and always asks if your having a good time.
at first i did not really like this field but it is growing on me and im liking it more and more everytime i go.

I've been to a few different paint ball courses and while I am no expert I will do my best to give you an accurate and detailed review.
There were only three courses laid out, two medium/small courses with inflatable obstacles and one large one that is a little bigger than the other two combined with cement obstacles.
That one was by far the most fun and allowed my novice team a better fighting chance to escape alive hahahaha (evil sadistic laugh)  We showed up a little early on a Sunday afternoon rented three sets of gear (guns masks and Ammo) and it cost us $178.
We explained that nobody playing today had any major experience with paint balling and would appreciate any pointers/help getting set up.
That resulted in a 20min boot camp on how to set up, load and charge your weapons as well as some basic strategy on how not to get lit up as soon as the game started.
3.5 hours later my humble novice band of warriors had been torn to shreds by 4 different sets of children still in grade school.
Didnt think they were having fun at losing their pride to grade schoolers but after every match they would look at me and ask can we go again?
The rule is as long as you have paint you can stay on the field and be placed against opponent so sure go on out there.
Our box of paint lasted almost 4 hours and five games.
As far as the field and viewing platform is concerned they are above par.
You really can't view the larger field from the platform but with a telephoto lens you can get some great shots.
The staff is top notch and easy to work with.
We will definitely be back!

This field is fantastic!
Best in the Las Vegas area!
They have two very well maintained airball fields and one massive scenario field.
It is built on an old golf course.
There is also an elevated viewing area with full view of both airball fields.
The place is clean inside and out.
They even have a shoe brush so you can clean your shoes after you're done playing.
Its not a big deal but the attention to detail is nice.
Inside, the A/C works well for when you need to cool down.
There are two large seating areas for big groups.
One of those areas has a dry erase board if you want to talk strategy with your team.
They have a decent arcade as well as a ping pong table.
The only thing I am not to jazzed about is the lack of lockers.
The rentals there are well maintained too.
I've heard no complaints about them and have not seen anyone need to go through multiple ones to get a proper working one as I have seen at other fields.
Mainly LVPP with their terrible rentals.
The staff is also very helpful and friendly.
We had a ref watching over all of our games at all times.
The ref would do his job of watching us to ensure everyone was being safe as well as calling people out and using an air horn to start and stop the game.
With any issues we had, the staff were willing to help.
The last thing is the paint.
It is very good quality.
Well above Recball paint but below tournament level.
They also do not charge an arm and a leg for it as well.
Overall, myself and my friends love this field!
THE field to go to in the Las Vegas, NV area.
It has a little something for everyone, is well staffed, and very well maintained.

Been there a few times over all an on field but the refs are horrible and lazy.
Two speed ball fields they have are always messy and very easy to slip due to the lack of care.
The scenario field is a joke and needs to have lots of tlc to it.
It's hard to find a ref that will walk all the way out there and actually ref the game.
If you by yourself or with a few friends its a waste of time unless your all professional players.
I've seen people kicked off fields by employees cause teams wanted to practice.
There paint is decent but a lil over priced.
It has the potential to be a great place but needs new management and better grass.
It only has 3 fill stations so you'll be waiting in line to refill your tanks.
Not the best but the worst in vegas.
