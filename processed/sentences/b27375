Best Bananas around.
Big ,delicious frozen bananas fresh dipped and rolled in nuts!
Found at fairs, craft marts and festivals.
Prices are reasonable and they are fresh dipped in front of you.
High Quality chocolate makes this my favorite!

WOW WOW WOW!
The San Francisco Chocolate Factory frozen bananas dipped in milk chocolate are the best EVER!
They dip it right there for you and OMG, it was the best treat I have had in a long time.
I just had one this past weekend on Saturday at the Glendale Chocolate Affaire.
It was so good that I thought about it all night and decided to go back to the Chocolate Affaire on Sunday, just for one of these scrumptious bananas.
From what I've heard, the chocolate dipped cheesecake is great too.
The only question I have is:  When is the next event?!!!

WOW WOW AND WOW have travelled all over the world, had this at the Carefree Chocolate Festival and could not get enough this is the best chocolate I have EVER had..kudos, more please!
