DO NOT BUY FURNITURE HERE!
The Salesman, Robert Baranello will lie to you about their policies, the manager Nathan will yell at you if you try to explain a situation.
Both of them tried to weisel their way out of abiding by store policies.
Robert spent over 3 hours talking about his autistic kid (which he wishes he did not have) his mail order bride of an ex wife, his planning to scam money out of a Christian school to get money to go to another country to have stem cell research done on his kid.
He will talk all about his "horrible life" and not about furniture.
MY ADVICE: STAY AWAY FROM THIS STORE!

Interesting previous review.
My experience was pretty good, trying to decide on style and color.
The manager David had the warehouse move furniture from one location to another for comparison.
Great service in that respect.
Still trying to determine what I want, but they were a huge help in eliminating what I didn't like.

One important point to make note of:   You may have to followup NUMEROUS times to ensure any refunds due you are actually refunded.
It only took 3-months to get a refund for furniture that we refused upon delivery as it wasnt going to work for our needs AND we called our salesperson at that moment to inform her and that we wanted the refund posted to our credit card (policy of company).
She assured us it would be taken care of, well here we are 3-months later.
POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING!
