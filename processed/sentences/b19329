Lunch - Fast service, friendly staff, good prices.
Blue collar bar (straight from the Owners mouth) - he didnt seem to mind me in my dress clothes for work, or my iPhone.
I plan to check it out for happy hour as well

This place is bad.
I'm all for dive bars, but this place is just brutal.
I felt dirty just coming here.
Best Nights: (choose up to 3)     Never

Been here once, and the place was friendly and the service was great.
The clientele were what you'd expect, and that's just fine with me.
