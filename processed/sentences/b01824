A wonderful hole in the wall on the NE corner of Southern and 16th street but watch out because it's so small you can miss it!
La Mejor is an excellent Mexican Bakery/ Panaderia if your craving some fresh and delicious pan dulce.
I grew up eating Mexican pastries in Guadalupe at 'The Flores Bakery' which was THE BEST pan dulce you could ever have!
but sadly the place was closed years ago and it has been extremely hard to find another place that can compete with it.
No worries though!!
because this place comes pretty damn close.
:)   Prices are CHEAP and you can always bet on the goods being fresh but as ALL Panaderia's the best time to go is in the morning so you don't have to worry about pastries that have been sitting around for hours.
Try it!
My favorites are always the Cuernito's, Pumpkin Empanada's and of course the classic Concha's.

If you see this place from the outside you would never think to stop.
But you must!!
They are magnificent!!
Customer service is on point, always greeted with a smile.
The prices are incredibly low especially for such quality poduct!!!
Our birthday was absolutely perfect and delicious!!!!
All of our guest could not stop raging about how amazing it was.
Perfectly moist, fresh fruit.filling, sweet frosting!!!
And perfectly decorated!

Even though I grew up in Arizona, I never really cared for Mexican pastries.
I've changed my mind.
Empanada de calabaza?
It's like October in my mouth, and I love it.
Cochitos?
I'm usually not a fan, but these were good.
Conchas?
Very fresh, but I'm not going crazy over them.
It's worth a try from someone who is a better judge than myself.
I don't know the names of everything, I just know that the morsels covered in pink sugar were my favorite.
They can be ordered in miniature sizes for a very sharable box of treats.
This is legit.
