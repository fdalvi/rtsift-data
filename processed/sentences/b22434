Kristin did my makeup and for my wedding at Mandalay Bay (in my suite) and did an amazing job!
Exactly what I asked for and was reasonably priced.
She also did two of my bridesmaid's hair and they looked fabulous.
Highly recommend her for weddings!

I found a review for Kristin here on Yelp and saw she made room visits for hair and makeup.
This was perfect for us since we had 10 people in our TI suit who got to sit around and hang out while Kristin worked on my hair and makeup.
I don't like sitting in a hair salon for hours by myself so this was just perfect.
Good price for the service since she also gave me eyelashes which is usually an additional charge.
The makeup and hair stayed perfect all night, well past when I normally would have changed back into a blotchy faced pumpkin :) .
Totally recommend Kristin for your hair and makeup needs while you're in Vegas!

I discovered Kristin via a recommendation and she came to my suite at the Aria to do my wedding hair and make-up this last Saturday.
Kristin made me look gorgeous and I felt like a princess on my wedding day.
Seriously, she did a stunning job!
What I really liked about Kristin, is she put me at ease.
We eloped in Vegas, but immediately Kristin made me feel like I was getting ready with a close friend, rather than someone that I just met.
She's super nice and we had a great conversation.
She also was great about listening to my ideas and working with me.
Beyond being great with hair/make-up and a lot of fun, she was completely professional and in contact with me leading up to the day.
Her prices were more than reasonable (and way cheaper than the Aria salon) and she even gave me a tube of lipgloss to keep for touch-ups.
Kristin is awesome and I highly recommend her.
Obviously I don't plan on getting married again, but I hope to use Kristin in the future for a "glam" night on the strip.
She really made me feel like a million dollars.
