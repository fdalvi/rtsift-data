In January I bought a KGB deal for a haircut for Â£12 at Dior Leigh and called soon after to book my appointment.
The woman was friendly on the phone but said the first Saturday appointment available wouldn't be until 23rd March.
I was ok with that although it was a long time away and so I booked.
This past week, I realised that, although I remembered my appointment was the coming Saturday, it hadn't made it into my Google calendar and I couldn't remember the time of it.
I called a few times on Tuesday and then again on Friday but never got though to anyone and their mailbox was full.
I even called a neighbouring business to see if they were still in business.
They thought they were but just not there that day, and also said someone else had called asking the same thing!
Today was my appointment day and when I called I finally got through to someone!
However, I was only to learn that they had changed hands and the old bookings weren't valid, and neither were the vouchers.
They said someone was supposed to contact me about that...
Guess what...
They didn't.
Since this business changed hands and didn't close and re-open under a new name, I thought this was especially lousy.
The woman apologised but the tone was 'not my problem'.
As a new owner, she should have taken responsibility for the old bookings by either calling to cancel them or honouring them.
She had an opportunity for me to become a customer but lost it when she didn't offer me a new appointment or discount, which would have been a nice gesture.
She ended with a 'bye, see you soon!
' I don't think so.

A real bait-and-switch!
Very unprofessional... 'New management'... Pft!

Just trying to book in my Edinburgh great deal , been trying to get an answer on phone for past week,!!
Are they still trading?
