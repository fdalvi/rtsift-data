Hair Transplant Surgery can be a very sensitive subject for many.
If you are considering this procedure look no further because this is the place to do it.
I have a very close friend who was looking into HTS for months until he found Modena.
Dr Yazdan and his team did such an unbelievably amazing procedure and my friend couldn't be happier with the results.
They also guarantee results, and when it comes to cosmetic procedures guarantees are rare.

Yelp, I had an FUE procedure by Dr. Yazdan 7 months ago.
Dr. Yazdan is a board certified MD, not some uneducated technician like all the other clinics I looked at.
Trust me, I took my time and did a lot of homework checking out all of the competition in the Vegas area.
I am very very happy with my results and my hair looks really natural and nice.
The procedure was painless and after my results I referred about 5 friends who also are very satisfied.
My brother did a procedure too and his hair looks great!
Thumbs up!
I will keep sending referrals !!
Great follow up care too !

I went with my boyfriend to get his consultation with Dr. Yaz a few weeks ago and we were both thoroughly impressed with his about of knowledge, his ability to answer all of our questions in terms that were understandable, and making my boyfriend feel comfortable about his thinning hair.
He opted to have the procedure done for the back of his head.
The outcome has been great so far!
NO pain, No ugly transplant line, and easy healing.
Dr. Yaz is amazing!!
I'm very happy my boyfriend found such a great doctor to treat his thinning hair.
