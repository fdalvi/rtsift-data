This is one of the few Walgreens with liquor... and a large liquor area.
Not the best selection, but definitely good when you're in a bad mood and just want a fricken drink.
Yeah...
I had a lot of those days a while back and the poor kid behind the register actually waves at me when I walk in.
lol  I like it though.
Very quick to check out, never had a problem, and the clerks are friendly.

Really nice employees.
Open until 12:00 so, it's really convenient.

I would give no stars if allowed.
Betty at checkout was extremely rude and abrasive.
However manager working at the rear of store was helpful and gets the star here.
