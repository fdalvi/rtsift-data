I've come here for any work or maintenance on my 2003 Mustang GT.
I had my clutch replaced this week, they had it done within 24 hours of getting it towed there, drove me 20 miles to work, and when I picked up my car, they got it detailed for free.
Great service, these guys really know about Mustangs, and their parts prices rival the cheapest parts on the internet - not sure how they can do this when most shops try to rip you off on parts.
I plan on coming here for all future work and recommend them to everyone, especially Mustang and muscle car owners.
