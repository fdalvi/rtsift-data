This is a clean, bright chippy that does all the usual plus kebabs and pizza.
The chips are consistant and the large fish great value.
Always plenty staff and they deliver.
A long time ago this used to the a great wee pub called the Bluebell.
They used to do a great steak pie.
Porty has a few chippys but this is the only one I'd use.

Being so close to the sea, Portobello is obviously going to have a fair few fish and chips shops to choose from and this is a good one to go for and located on Portobello High Street, it is only a couple of hundred metres from the beach front.
I have been here twice and the chips are always really tasty and the portions pretty good.
The batter on the haddock can be a bit greasy but it provides good value for money.
The restaurant itself is very spacious and you get plenty of room to be comfortable in your surroundings if you choose to eat in.
The restaurant does not only do fish and chips, but also kebabs, pizzas and baked potatos, so will cater for most people's tastes.
The place also offers a delivery service if you can't bring yourself to go there in person.
