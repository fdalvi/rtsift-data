The Real Scot Shop is slightly less garish than a lot of the tourist shops in Edinburgh.
Selling what looks like real tartan kilts as well as sporrans, it seems like it makes an attempt to get the traditional culture of Scotland just right in its stock.
As Steph said, they stock some classier gifts that would be fitting for a formal present, or something tasteful for your gran.
But they also have a range of slightly tackier souvenirs if that's what you're looking for.
