I can not recommend this dental office.
The front office staff can not properly make an appointment for follow ups, they wait until you write out your check to tell you they only take cash.
I've been trying to get a refund from them for the overcharging they did to my dental insurance company.
They  made up things that they did and charged me.
They only will put you on hold when you call to try to address this.
I want my refund.
Novocaine is offered at an additional cost.
I have always had it included with a filling.
I've been waiting 6 months so far.
No refund yet.

Dr. Pourkhomami is an excellent and very caring dentist.
I found her to be very skilled and very gentle and kind.
I will definitely stay with this office for all my dental needs and her hygienist Robert is excellent as well!
The office manager Erica was so caring and nice and got my insurance approval taken care of in no time.

Very pleased.
I was able to get a last minute appointment right before a holiday.
Hours are excellent for busy people.
Friendly front office staff.that was very helpful.
Dr. Pourkhomami is very personable and competent.
Jordan, the dental assistant, is awesome and very professional.
