Brand new Subway store opened just a week or so ago!
Very convenient in the Fry's Superstition Springs shopping complex.

Normally like subway, they are all pretty much the same but this one is painfully slow.
We were the only people in line with two workers behind the counter and it took sooo long to get our orders and leave that it was ridiculous.
Maybe just an off night or something, but they shouldn't make it that hard to buy their stuff.

If you like soft bread don't go to his location, this one is by my house but every time I've gone my sandwich feels like its on a rock versus bread.
Not fresh at all
