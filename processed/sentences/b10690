I have been seeing Dr. Shoemaker for 14 years now.
He is a terrific doctor.
My family also goes to him.
He is a very kind man who takes his time with you and makes you feel like you are his only patient.
He covers all bases in your health and i highly suggest him.

I just called Dr. Shoemaker's office to make an appointment and was told the next available appointment (maybe due to being a new patient, I'm not sure) would be in over three (3) months.
Is he that good?
I think not to wait over three months.

Dr. Shoemaker is the best doctor I have ever had.
I left Las Vegas a number of years ago and still miss having him as my doctor.
He always had time to listen to me and hear what I was saying.
That is invaluable in a doctor.
I just want to thank Dr. Shoemaker for his incredible service while I was in Las Vegas.
