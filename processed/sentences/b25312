I took my BMW to Maaco because it showed signs of heavy oxidation on the hood and roof of the car after only a few years.
the dealership and several other body shops wanted to charge me 2-3 times the price of what Maaco did.
I found Mike who works there to be extremely knowledgeable.
He took the time to help me and was very patient.
The best part of all was that they got everything done in just 3 days!!
I would highly recommend this Maaco location for all your auto body needs!

I may writing my review premature but so far I have had a good experience.
I bought a 2001 Civic that needed a new bumper and paint.
I have to admit I was pretty apprehensive since reviews about Maaco shops can be horrible to say the least.
But on an older car I am not looking to spend a ton of money but I still want quality work.
The sales rep (Mike) came out looked at my car and gave me some advice about what I should do.
He ordered me a new bumper, had it painted, and put on in less than 3 days.
I even spoke briefly with the owner and hope this new business does well.
As of today, it looks great and I am happy.
What will it look like in a couple months...well...we shall see.
My suggestion is to make sure they put on more than one base coat (I requested a 2nd but was told 3 is better)), more than one clear coat I (I received 2), and that they do the proper prep work if necessary.
I hope this shop can make a name for itself...I plan on getting other touch up work if the quality holds up.
If it does not hold up I will be back on YELP letting you know to stay away :)    I figure if they mess up painting this brand new bumper that requires little prep work stay away.

RE:  Maaco in Chandler, AZ Not all Maaco's are the same.
Management & staff DO make a difference!
Dust in clear coat needed attention.
Maaco 'made it right'.
They took the time and effort to resolve all pending matters.
THANKS.
