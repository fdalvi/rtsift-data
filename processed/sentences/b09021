My oven blew out the heater element - Bam!
- called Lewis, and they sent Frank out.
He fixed it, tested it, cleaned up, and then helped me with my doorbell (N/C).
I've been using this locally owned business for twenty years now, and they are always prompt, reliable and reasonable prices for appliance repair.
they fixed my washing machine, and dryer too.
Don't throw that appliance away - Be Green and re-use, re-cycle, and reduce consumption by repairing instead of replacing

My Maytag Washer was off balance AGAIN.
I didn't want a new machine, so when I called Lewis Appliance, they seemed familiar with the problem.
The lady answering the phone said they would need the machine over night.
She also gave me an estimate for repairing the machine.
The over night turned into 6 days, and the estimate was way under.........
The men that returned the machine were very nice, and said that it was the best machine ever made, and it should continue to work for another 20 years.
I hope they're right.
I'll give them 5 stars, if they are!

They did a great job repairing my washing machine and ice maker.
Highly recomended.
Great customer service and price.
