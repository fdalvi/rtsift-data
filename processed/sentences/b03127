Get fuel here!
Yay!

They have the BEST carwash I have ever used - only $7!!
I just arrived yesterday, driving 2,500 miles from VA Beach and this wash got it looking better than my old favorite back home.

DON'T USE THIS STATION!!!!!
THEY PUT $126.00 CHARGE ON YOUR CREDIT CARD!!!!!!
I just got off the phone with them, as I thought someone had stolen my card when I saw my charge for $18.31 (I topped off my tank and bought a $7 car wash) and then another one for $126.00.
That's ridiculous!!!!!!!
This was NOT a debit card (I do understand putting a hold on those to make sure you don't spend the money before their charge goes through) but there is NO warning sign or anything.
I will NEVER go there again....my car won't even hold more than $50 worth of gas, and you'll have the actual charge as WELL as the $126 charge on there until they decide to take it off.
NEVER, NEVER AGAIN!!!!!
Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice shame on me!
