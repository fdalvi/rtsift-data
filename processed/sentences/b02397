This location is ALWAYS out of stock on items.
It's disorganized, messy, and frankly...behind on the times.
I love Target, but I'm really starting to get burnt out on this spot.

This is an older location, but Target is Target nonetheless.
They always seem to have what I am looking for (or not looking for..you always end up buying something you didn't intend on) and the shelves seem to always be stocked.
The employees are nice and always say hello or ask if you need help.
There are usually a couple registers open during non-busy times, and anytime I have been there when it has been busy, the lines move quickly.
This location isn't as nice as Tempe Marketplace or the store on Longmore but it's close to where I live, the parking lot isn't terribly annoying, and I know that I will be able to get what I need at a decent price.

Big lines always 2 registers open an its laborDay weekend 15 min to buy 2 things !!!
An how hard is it to do a price check at this store when the product is rite there REALLY!!
