Surprisingly clean and staff is pretty helpful.

I must say this one is cleaner than the nellis location.
The prices seem to be cheaper but the selection isn't as great.
For drinks they had soda and sunny d that's it.
Other locations have everything from apple juice to zebra juice lol.
I wouldn't go out of my way when the nellis one is closer but I am impressed with the cleanliness.
And the employees are helpful.

I give it five stars.
