OK, most of you are gonna be way too young to even think about this place, a senior assisted living place, but hey, we all know someone and this is the creme de la creme!
Location - Very nice location in the heart of Green Valley Ranch.
Amidst the walk paths, greenery and very cool ambiance.
Staff - Awesome.
The people here are the greatest.
Feeling - This place feels like a luxury cruise ship, instead of an institution.
Activities - How cool.
You can do a lot of stuff here and they take you around!
Facilities - Top class.
No shortchanging here.
Price - Start saving now.
A bit pricey, but if you want to be pampered as you age, COME HERE.
If you got the dough, this is the place to go.

This is a great retirement community.
I cannot review it much because I do not live here; however, My grandmother is very happy here and well taken care of.
They have a daily list of events in which residents can partake in including things that are not on site.
Meals each day as well differ and that gives residents chances to change things up.
I've ate here several times and the food is very good especially with the plethora of different things cooked up on holidays.
Residents are allowed small animals on premises as well which helps with companionship.
There is a gym and activity center so that residents may also get exercise.
Lastly, my grandmother's favorite----a beauty salon!

They treat my mom great!!
