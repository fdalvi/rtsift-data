Even slower than Walgreens and at least walgreens will fill your prescription from off site without making you drive across town to another pharmacy to get a prescription filled.

The prices at this store are much higher than other similar stores.
The staff is EXTREMELY rude, unhelpful, even "heckling" customers at times.
One little older lady left the store in tears due to treatment of employee ASHLEY.
Please choose a different store!

This store has to be the worst CVS ever.
All I want to do is pick up my pictures and the guy who is playing manger has no idea what he is doing.
Next time I am going to order my pics from snap fish.
