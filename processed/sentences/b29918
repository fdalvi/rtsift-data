This older place looks as if it used to be a KFC or other chain restaurant, & it has a small dining room that seats 20.
I stopped in today for lunch, & ordered a 2 Chile Relleno Combination plus a hard shredded beef taco.
In a little while my food came out.
There were the two Rellenos, made with Anaheim Chiles, a normal serving of Spanish Rice & refried beans, plus a little Pico de Gallo & a little Guacamole, as well as 4 warm corn tortillas, a basket of chips (available on request at no extra charge), & my taco.
This was a lot of food, & I could have skipped the taco & the chips.
Everything tasted ok, but nothing was special, & the Chile Rellenos were too mild for my taste.
GOOD:  *  Friendly service.
*  Comfortable booth seating.
*  Reasonable prices.
$5.56 for the Combo plus $1.95 for the side taco.
*  Generous amount of food.
*  A squirt bottle of salsa to add as you please.
NOT SO GOOD:  *  Mexican music playing over the P.A.
wasn't hurting anything, but then the jukebox started loudly blaring out another song on top of the other one!
*  The place had an ucky smell to it.
*  The taco had a normal amount of shredded beef, but then just a dab of shredded lettuce & that's it.
Little or no cheese, & no tomato!
(Yes, you could put the Pico de Gallo & Guacamole in there, but then what do you do with the FOUR warm tortillas?
)  Meh.

super unhealthy...which means it's amazing!
shady place though

Que paso Homey?!
