I hate to give something related to Boys & Girls Club less than 3 stars, but I just wasn't impressed.
While BGC is a great organization, my first experience with them was with the flyer they leave at your house announcing the next date they will be in your neighborhood to pick up.
I left my stuff curbside with the flyer as requested and the truck never came by.
This could explain why the thrift shop was not so great.
The thrift shop is okay, but the pricing scheme is completely off.
For every item that is priced appropriately, there are two that aren't.
I know it's a charitable organization, but I'm not going to pay near retail for someone else's crap when  I can go to IKEA or Target and get my own brand new crap for almost the same.
Amidst all the crap, however, my mom managed to find a big pile of non-crap that she's "going to make a profit on.

Books, clothing, household items, furniture, records, jewelry, little old ladies maning the register, teenagers stocking shelves, men hauling in furniture.
I came here in search of the perfect Horrible Holiday outfit for an Ugly Sweater party and good Lord I found exactly what I was looking for.
There is no shortage of little old lady clothes from the 80s and 90s in this place.
The only really annoying part is there is only one dressing room, stake it out early and try to beat anyone to it.
Otherwise, like my experience, you'll be standing there with your Christmas clothes hanging in your arms wishing evil thoughts upon the woman on the other side of the fitting room door.
They also have discounts running at various times.
I had an item with a green dot on it which made it %25 off!
Hey why not!

Not impressed with the new management.
This place has changed.
