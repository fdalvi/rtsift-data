I am in the process of switching from Skank of America so I opened an account here.
The service here is very friendly and personalized and unlike a big corporate bank, most of my requests are greeted with a yes and more often than not, are handled and carried out by a friendly associate as opposed to being told how I can go home and do it myself online.
Also, there seems to NEVER be a crowd at this location so I am usually in and out in 5 minutes instead of waiting in a long line for one of two tellers to look after me.
A very refreshing banking experience

Worst customer service.
I opened an account online and went to the branch to make the initial deposit.
They don't know what their online banking system is doing and they had to send it to another location in Tucson, this is after I had called yesterday to verify that I could make the initial deposit in my local branch.
Get it together!
If you are going to have an online system, make sure the branch operations coincide with that!
I'm going to cancel my account and do my business elsewhere.
Thanks for the headache!

Taste of the Biltmore had upscale restaurants and caterer.
Nice ambience.
