My office is right across the street, so I eat here at least once a month.
The employees are always nice, the place is clean and always busy.

Friendly staff Great speedy service

This location is just down the street from where I work, so it's perfect for me to get in and out of in a jiffy.
Very friendly crew here.
They work hard and fast to get customers their food in a timely manner.
My food was so delicious and fresh!
I know I will definitely be back there for lunch and since they also serve breakfast, I will try that as well.
