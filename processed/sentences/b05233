My partner was getting an endoscopy so while that experience itself could not be pleasant, this review is for the staff.
The facility was clean and had a good sized waiting area.
The front office assistant was very pleasant, and helpful.
The nurses were efficient and helpful and even got him some orange juice to drink after the procedure and brought comfortable chairs and a blanket for the patient while we waited for our ride.

The surgeon was good, but the Anesthesiologist was a joke.
Full of himself.
Thought he was a top notch surgeon.
not impressed.

I had surgery here in February 2014.
The facility was clean and spacious.
The staff was magnificent in pre-op and post-op areas.
I don't know anything about the surgery because I slept through the whole procedure.
My recovery has been better than I ever expected, thanks to my surgeon and the staff at Seven Hills Surgery Center.
If I ever need surgery again, I would not hesitate to return.
