Ummmm red velvet ice cream?
YES!!!!!
Great ice cream on a chilly phoenix afternoon.
A little pricey, $5 schmoes for a kids cup.
Total for 2 adults and a toddler about $18.00 bucks.
The chicks working the counter were super cool tho and I thought the overall vibe was nicer than ColdSlabCreamatorium.
Thumbs up cats and birds...
