Marketing-only:  greenwash and healthy-washed, really just a lackluster meal with a hefty pricetag that isn't that green or healthy.
Styrofoam cup anyone??

I went in with two other guys and noticed that the name of the place is actually Fresh 'n Fast now.
There were just a handful of people despite it being lunch time.
I ended up ordering the black bean burger and a fruit cup.
The place might have fresh food, but it certainly was not fast.
The black bean burger was pretty tasty though.
It was a little spicy, which was a nice twist.
The fruit cup included watermelon, cantaloupe, pineapple, and strawberries.
All but the strawberries were good.

I've been spoiled with good healthy foods in health freak Los Angeles.
This place is good, but it's just that A-OK.
I mean I feel like if this was fantastic food for this price then people would maybe realize fresh, healthy is very tasty and can be fast foods and it would be a hit.
I like it but getting a combo is like $10-12 and I dont see how this will work for just good enough to satisfy people looking for good food and don't really care if it's healthy or not.
Healthy food goers- probably find this place wonderful though as it's slim pickins in this town.
I enjoy their airbaked fries and chicken.
I like that they have flavored ketchup.
Their black bean and turkey burgers are good.
Their smoothies are good and its not as fatty as a smoothie at the usual places.
3.5 stars
