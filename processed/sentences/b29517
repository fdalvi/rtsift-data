Awesome and unique selection of great bags and accessories.
Prices are much more afforable than department stores and other big name brands and retailers.
Selection is always stylish, current and trendy.
And to top it off - you are supporting a locally owned and run business.

I love this boutique.
I am so glad they have a showroom now.
I cancelled my Lifetime membership, so I cannot find them at those gyms anymore.
They usually set up a spot at different gyms around the valley.
They have purses (I like their Big Buddha brand) and tons of accessories.
Last Friday, I went to get a couple of things, good luck with that.
I ended up with over 10 items.
I got an awesome scarf, very unique.
Maiva shops in NYC for items that are a little different, so you don't look like everyone else.
I got a purse organizer, lets see if this helps, my bags are getting bigger and bigger.
My hubby always wonders what I carry in them.
A small child could fit in it.
I also got a couple of this key finders.
It has a strong magnet, so the key attaches to it and you don't have to dig around for it.
So nice.
I gave one already to a friend and she loved it.
Lots of bracelets with bling.
I love bling.

What a beautiful store!!
I have been a fan of Just Jane for a long time and I am so happy they now have the exposure of a store front.
The handbag and accessory selection is beautiful and now they are starting to carry unique boutique type clothing In all sizes.
I wish them lots of luck in their new location and look forward to many more trips to Just Jane Boutique.
