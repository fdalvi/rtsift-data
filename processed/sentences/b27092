This little place is across from Spring Valley hospital.
If you drive by it they have a big sign advertising free water.
Well we didn't try the water but we did the have yogurt.
For starters it is .35/oz.
We were the only customers the whole time we were there...which was odd.
This is where the 2 stars comes from.
When we arrived the worker was nowhere to be seen.
After we paid she disappeared again... And we were still there.
They do not have a ton of flavors but a balance of fruity and non.
They have all your typical toppings as well.
I had a peanut butter with cap'n crunch and strawberries.
The wife had cake batter with strawberries and cheesecake bits.
Mine was good.
Great flavor.
The wife was not as pleased with hers as she described it as tasting like she thought play-doh would.
I would imagine we may give it another shot as it is very near our home...

This is a below-average yogurt shop.
When we walked in the only people we saw was a couple at another table.
It turns out that the girl was working there but since business was dead she was chatting it up with her boyfriend.
I don't know what the deal is with their water but I think you can buy refillable containers to take home.
Whatever the case is, I didn't care enough to inquire.
On the right side of the shop when you enter are some shelves with some health/fitness supplements.
When we were there it looked like a complete disaster with boxes all over the floor and some sort of display in pieces.
I guess the girl was in the process of putting it together.
As for the frozen yogurt... meh.
Both the peanut butter and red velvet cake were decent but they melted very quickly and turned into a watery mess.
There are so many other yogurt places in town that I doubt I'll ever be back.

There are much better yogurt shops to go to.
Prices are higher than average and their froyo isn't that great.
Also, don't be fooled by their $.99 or "free" deals.
They don't honor it sometimes.
