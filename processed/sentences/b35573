Usually the wait is less than 15 min.
for a blood draw.
I go in the middle of the day between noon-3pm.
Depending on which tech you get, you may be blamed for the tech's inability to draw blood out of your vein.
That gets so annoying!
If my doctor (who NEVER has had a problem getting my vein for a blood draw or weekly IV) didn't have his office way in north Scottsdale I'd have him draw my blood (since I have to do so weekly for the treatment I'm under).
Only because this Labcorp is super convenient in locale, and the wait is quite short, I keep going.
But if I find some place better that's closer, I'm jumping this ship.

I arrived and signed in and with no one in front of me.
The lady called me and one other girl and took her in so I kind of stood back and waited.
Then she came back and called 2 other people.
I asked the other lady at the front desk if I was supposed to follow her.
I think she was new but she told me to just sit tight for a minute.
Another 10 minutes went by and I brought to their attention that I was still waiting and I had already been called.
Then they were confused as to what I was supposed to have done.
( A simple drug screen) They had no phone for making outgoing calls to find out what type of test I needed.
They couldn't find the forms I needed.
The lady that originally called me up kept mis speaking and say the wrong thing.
Just seemed really flustered and disorganized.
Another lady came back from a break, her lab coat was completely wrinkled and she was on her cell phone in the front.
Very unprofessional place.
Glad I won't have to go there again!

This is right next door to my urologists office.
They got me in quick without an appointment for a STAT request from my doctor.
While in the waiting room I got really apprehensive of this place drawing my blood from the previous reviews, I am kind of a baby about that type of stuff, but contrary to the reviews I had no issues.
