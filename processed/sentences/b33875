do not go to gold stash to have jewelry repaired - took my jewelry to signal butte location, store closed unexpectedly, still trying to get someone from corporate to call me back - no answer to phone messages or email messages.
something is shady about this company.
still trying to get my necklace back.
took the necklace in back in october of 2013.

Don't send them anything!!!
Gold Stash still owes me for the jewelry I sent them in December.
They have written me a bad check and have done nothing to make things right.
Their number 800-877-1077 never allows you to speak to a human being, and they never return my calls.

FRAUD ALERT!
If I could give a negative star rating I would!
They stole my jewelry, would not return it, despite my repeated attempts to contact them.
They have awful customer service!
They lie, steal, and cheat.
I did my research and they had a positive rating, but things went south right after that apparently.
Do not believe them.
Do not go to businesses endorsed by Dave Ramsey.
Period.
Nuff said.
