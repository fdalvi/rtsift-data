I LOVE ED!
He's the most adorable little man who serves up some really good street eats.
His Chicago dog is out of this world.
It's the reason I seek him out every month.
You can find him most days of the week manning his cart in downtown Phoenix.
He's got a decent variety of dogs to choose from and every one I've tried has been really good.
If you see his cart, I would recommend stoping by for a bite.

I am shocked.
Only one review for ETHD.
A Phoenix institution.
Thousands of us do jury duty.
Ed's is a must stop on jury day.
Especially for the Chicago Dog.
He has all the napkins you need, plus places to sit.

The Polish sausage on a bun I had for lunch today was terrific.
Why two stars?
Because when I paid with my debit card, Ed used the card reading app on his phone and added a tip without asking - the receipt was emailed to me so I didn't know he did that until later.
Look dude, I'm happy to tip you, but it's not cool to take advantage of your customers like that.
Funny thing is, I would have left a bigger tip had he given me the option.
So, two stars.
He lost a five star rating over a measly dollar.

Ed is a very nice guy and has excellent dogs!!
I love the Supperdogger and the Argentine Soripan!
The fixings he add to all the dogs are extremely good!!
If you are downtown and want a good hotdog, hit up Ed!

Good dogs at a good price.
Ed offers a nice variety too.
I often walk around downtown but never made to the courthouse until this afternoon when I had to report for jury duty.
Oddly enough, I had read about Ed somewhere before but this was the first I had been by his cart.
Today he was set up on the SW corner of Jefferson & 1st Ave.
I'm not sure if this is a regular spot or if he moves about the area but I'll be on the lookout for him again so I can try a variety of his hot dogs.
Ed stocks Faygo Root Beer in cans.
That alone is worth a mention.
