Ok...So I wanted to do something extra special for my husband for Valentine's Day.
I went into this shop to chose the items for a gift basket.
What was SO cool?
I was able to choose a HUGE selection from Las Vegas Fruit & Nuts (and completely FILL a basket for under $50.00).
I walked in the day they we roasting nuts...OMG, mouth watering!
The gold dust popcorn is incredibly addictive and the dark chocolate covered almonds are so tasty.
I am SO impressed with this company that I will be considering them first when I need another great basket.
Lucky for me that my husband brought the basket home and I got to sample their fabulous wares!
Highly recommended!

I love this place for the two young ladies that work there.
I can tell these owners love and care for this business.
They say they actually specialize in chocolate, but which I believe because they have a variety of them here.
This place must be great during Valentines day, or birthday tho.
I love the spicy nuts mix.
