Surprised no one has reviewed this location yet.
I have just started my little guy here.
We had an introductory class and then finished our first paid class.
The staff are extremely nice and attentive.
The facility is clean and the program fun for the little ones.
My son is 2.5 and in the "Beasts" class.
They all seem to have fun and get along well.
I also have my MIL take him to the open play times during the week and she told me that the staff has been great during those times as well.
So far we're happy!

The manager of this location is awesome!
And Miss Andrea is fantastic with the kids (Beasts)!
:)  Little C has so much fun at class.
The teachers spray down the mat and equipment after every class, so that's kinda comforting.
Parent participation is kinda hit or miss, depending on which class you attend.
You can go to a class where every parent is up and running around with/after their kids during exploration time during class.
Or go to another where they're sitting down watching the kids run around.
The kids seem to have a great time regardless.
If you're the type of parent that gets involved (like J and I), you'll be sweating by the time class is finished trying to keep up with your kid!
LOL   VIP benefits if you enroll for the next season during an enrollment party.
Great discounts for the next full season, if you can pay in full during one of the enrollment parties!
Payment plans for those that need it.
For less than the cost of one family dinner out per week, your LO can have a BLAST at The Little Gym!

This is a great place to bring your children to run, play, dance and learn.
The staff here is excellent, the place is clean and safe.
We have been going here for 3 years and have not had a bad experience yet.

My daughter loves this place!!
Great instructors!
Super clean!
Love how they challenge my daughter to try new things and give her the confidence she needs to conquer the world!!
Thank you little Gym of PV!
