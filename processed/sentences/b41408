This establishment is no longer in business.
The phone number is someone's private number.

Newly open establishment with friendly service.
The bartenders are great, second time there had a sample of beer ready for me before I even sat down.
Very clean looking place and also a very diverse menu.

Service was a little weak,,,,,,Bartender was also the cook....NO ONE in the place at 12:30pm on a Friday should have clued me in......took forever to get my lunch.
It was cold, the fry grease looked as if it hadn't been changed since the 90's.
Pastrami sandwich tasted spoiled....would not recommend.
