I was specifically looking for retro video games so this review is specifically in regards to that category.
The store was fairly small and didn't have a great selection of games.
The selection they did have tended to be fairly average in quality.
The prices seemed fair in comparison to other retro game carrying stores.
Overall, I wasn't that impressed.

Awesome place!
The owner is very nice and helpful.
I took in a couple old systems I picked up from yard sales without cords and he was able to find everything I needed between aftermarket and used items.

Where does this place get their prices from?
EBay is my first guess.
If you are looking for retro games then avoid this place like the plague.
You will run out of this store faster than you entered.
Seriously the prices are beyond gouged and outright ludicrous.
How are they still in business?
I feel sick after going in there.
Heed my words and if you're still curious about this place after reading this SOS.
Then remember...you were warned.
