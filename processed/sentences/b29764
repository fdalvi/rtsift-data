As the saying goes "The stars know...".
If the stars don't know - then Katherine does!
A woman of many talents, indeed.
During the course of our first conversation, in a most random meeting while out walking the world, she revealed her aptitude for reading the Tarot.
Having studied metaphysics for decades, and dabbled in Tarot, myself, I found her insights intriguing.
Plus she was about to enroll students in her course for  "Tarot Reading 101"!
If it's not too cliche' may I add, "When the student is ready, the teacher appears.
"  I signed up on the spot.
Katherine's warm presence, clear  and direct communication style and her strong foundational knowledge of metaphysics made the ambiguous realm of Tarot intelligible.
As a natural teacher she guides the class to find the answers and keeps every one on track during discussions, with a little humor to keep it bubbling along.
Not a moment of disappointment here - even when I pressed her with many more advanced questions throughout our weekly 12 week course.
I was so impressed, that post class, I opted for a most insightful astrology reading with her as well.

Katherine is a great resource for astrology readings and tarot readings.
I've had the pleasure of receiving both from her and have found the appointment fun and informative.
I continue to rely on Katherine when I feel that I need input to my life.

Katherine combined her astrological understanding and gift of intuition with her deep compassion for helping others to create a life awakening experience for me during our first session.
Through Katherine's teachings of my astrological chart, I realized for the first time in my life that I am truly unique and I don't need to try and change who I am, just love and accept myself for being me.
After all there is only one me!
By embracing my strengths instead constantly judging my faults, I feel empowered that I can create the happiness I have been seeking within my life and career.
I will definitely meet with Katherine on a regular basis and when faced with any big decisions.
Her enthusiasm and love for helping others through astrology and tarot makes for a detailed and personal experience.

I could spend the whole day with Katherine!
And I mean that in a way that she is someone who makes you feel like a friend.
She made me laugh, I don't even know how many times, she just made me feel so comfortable.
I have been going through hard times at this point in my life.
Basically just not knowing what path I should be on, just plain confusion on my part.
Everything that was mentioned was spot on.
From how I grew up, to what I feel I must be doing but cannot seem to grasp.
I am sure if I was being video taped you would see how big my eyes were the whole time 8* I would recommend Katherine to everyone and their mother.
But I know if you are reading this it was because she was meant to fall in your path like she did mine.
I wouldn't trade her for anyone!
