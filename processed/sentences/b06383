I bought a bridesmaid's dress at David's Bridal for around $200.
David's wanted $60 for just a hem and I believe another $25 because it would be a two week turn around.
Of course I said no way and went to another tailor in town I was familiar with.
He wanted $100.
Apparently this double, triple skirt design makes for expensive alterations.
So at this point I'm about to wear some stripper heels for height or get creative with double-sided tape.
But a coworker told me about this place and she highly recommended them.
I went on a Saturday and she looked at the dress and quoted $25 with a three day turn around.
I was leaving Friday morning.
On Thursday night before she closed she called to make sure I was coming because she knew I needed it Saturday.
I wound up picking it up Friday morning and it turned out perfect.
I can't recommend this place enough for reasonable prices and great customer service.

I bring my clothes here all the time when I need alterations.
They do a great job all the time.
The price is not bad either.

I have gone to Crystal Alterations for years.
The woman who owns the shop is always so friendly and helpful.
Im hit or miss when I come in, but she makes it clear she remembers me by how she interacts with me.
Small alterations shop, but full of heart.

Great prices, great alterations and super friendly!
I hadn't been in here in at least 2 years and right when I walked in, the lady recognized me and asked how have I been?
How's that for great customer service?
It's a little far from my house since I've moved, but this is the only place I trust to hem my expensive clothing!
