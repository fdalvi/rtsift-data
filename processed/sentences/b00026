I make jewelry...for myself and for others.
I am always looking for a great deal on the finest beads and findings.
My first visit to this Michael's came on the day after Thanksgiving.
Hell?
No really.
After elbowing through a few rows of ladies, I reached a mongo wall of strings of beads.
Heaven!
They have the best selection I have seen, really, anywhere.
There are always coupons to be found...on their website, in the Sunday newspaper, on your door step, or sign up to get them delivered to your mailbox.
It makes a major difference on your wallet.
Now that's what I call a finding!

Friendly staff...tons of great ideas and products!
I came here after a disappointing experience at Archivers in the same mall.
From now on, I'll happily come here instead!

Well, it's a Michaels.
Nothing particularly special there.
Normally, I'd give most Michaels stores 4stars, but this one tends to be a bit messy and has the wonkiest layout of any craft store.
Also, if you pop in and don't find what you're looking for, you have to loop through ALL the checkouts to exit (not just pass by one like at most similar stores).
This makes me feel a bit uncomfortable if they happen to not have what I'm looking for or if I just stop in to price something, etc.
Overall, a decent place.
Greenway Station on the whole is a bit of a weird shopping center, but I do love that a craft store is in the mix.
