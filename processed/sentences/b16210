Lines move quickly, they serve coffee & snacks, and they are always friendly.
Drive thru ATM's also.-Really why is there braille on the drive-thru ATM?

I had to open a business account and I went to this bank.
Well, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.
I informed the receptionist, guy that I was here for a business account and he asked me to wait while he went somewhere.
Looking around there was about 4 people waiting too.
When the receptionist guy returned he asked me to follow him and he took me into an office in front of all the people waiting.
I met Ruppi who begin to help me with the business account.
There were the usual questions and waiting while papers were filled out and crosschecked.
Ruppi was very helpful and went beyond the norm a few times during the application process.
After about 20 minutes I was sent on my way with everything signed and ready to go.
I had the online banking and a nice new debit card in the mail.
Not bad at all.

Busy on normal payday rush hours.
Friendly staff !

I was in the Chinatown area and needed to do some banking.
I stopped here at the drive through ATM.
The only problem is the area is like a maze.
You have to drive to the back, make a U, and then come up to the ATM.
Getting out on Spring Mountain is iffy at best.
Then I found out I could exit via Arville.
Another time if I stop here again.

Personal bankers work extremely slow.
It took us about 1 1/2 hrs just to be added to my husband's existing account and it wasn't even busy.
