wish there were stars in the negative.
i actually had geico insurance until they scammed me and did the same with 4 others that i know of.
basically; i put my payment on auto for ease and simply made sure i always had money to cover the payment.
one day i get stoped by the police because "your registration has been suspended due to lack of payment".
well i only found this out after geico had suspended it without notifing me by mail or phone call.
so; i go to the dmv only to find out it will cost 750.00 to reinstate the registration and i will be listed as a high risk driver which will raise my rates.
when i asked geico why they didn't call me the response was "that is a luxury that we do if we have time".
now if that wasn't bad enough geico is trying to collect money on that time they suspended my registration.
bottom line is this; insurance company's all quote rates which tend to be almost identical to each other.
so; why take the risk with geico and becaome another victim of their scam?
