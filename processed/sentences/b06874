Very, umm, interesting location for this store.
Compared to other TJ Maxx locations this one is great because there aren't dust bunnies all over the dressing room.
That was ALWAYS my biggest complaint and annoyance when I go to other discount retail stores.
Besides the clothes (PLEASE expand the atheletic department!
) there is a nice home goods section.
I picked up a nice slab of marble and marble coasters for a very low price.

TJ Maxx has long been a favorite.
Even in the strange land that is Westgate Mall, this location can offer up a treasure now and then.
They have a particularly good homegood section and I've been known to find a killer handbag there as well.

Wide selection and pretty decently put together given the constant ransacking that these stores tend to go through.
I mean, really, it's a 4-pack of underwear, why do you need to tear four of them apart to put together a pack of the same color?
Asshats.
Deals are generally good, and much better on some things than others.

Whelp... one week I found a radtastic solid wood import from India... a rocking buffet that would look great in my new place, but the next week it was gone.
I'm not knocking stars because I'm an idiot and can't make a decision to save my life (if it was meant to be it would have been there, right), I'm knocking some stars because there's little to no organization and outside of the folks up front who'll check you out, I don't know that they staff the joint.
I had a few questions but wasn't able to track anyone down which was a bummer.
Stock is always changing (grumble, grumble) so it's worth repeat visits if you're just browsing.

I really enjoy shopping at TJ Maxx.
It is one of those places I can just wander around.
You never know what you will find and that makes shopping fun.
The store is clean and pretty organized.
Staff seems pretty friendly overall.
