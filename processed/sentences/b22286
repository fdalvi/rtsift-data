I love going into the Casey's on Ottawa street, it is so convenient after a day of shopping at the Sunrise Plaza.
The food is so consistant, it is always hot and fresh.
I have yet to have something on their menu that I did not like.
The only negative thing I can say is I have had very bad luck there with servers, they never seem to come check on us mid-way through the meal but that could just be my bad luck.
Other then that they have great food, they are quick, affordable and have a great atmosphere.
I would always recommend Casey's on Ottawa Street.

First time here, service was very very slow.
An my veggie burger was tasteless and dryer then the desert!
The table was sticky and the table behind us the girl was screaming the whole time.After the meal our receipt was given.
And then we waited 25 Min's for her to come back for us to leave.
Would I go back.
No.
Would I recommend?
No.
I'll stick with Montana's.
