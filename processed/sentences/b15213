Wal Mart's are what they are.
The prices are okay here, but it has begun to get a bit shabby, and more like the lower end of what I would expect to see on the "people of Wal Mart page".
They do have a market here, and some of their food is pretty decent.
Overall the staff is very nice.
I had one problem here a long time ago when I tried to get photos developed, so I would stay away from that

It's Walmart.
What kind of review can we write over and over?
I'll buy almost anything here.
I think the one thing I won't buy fruit and veggies.
Don't know why?
I'll buy meat here, milk, eggs, oh not chicken.
I think that's because I see those items sit out after returns and never go back fast enough.
Or I am just too picky and buy those items at Safeway or Fry's.

"Old" Wal Mart is always an adventure.

Spend 20 minutes shopping 40 in the line and the place was so dirty and the employees are just not happy at all.
Target here I come.
