Fortunately enough to swing by for a soft opening!
Great place to grab a snack before or after a movie at MAC.
Sampled the chocolate chip waffle bites sprinkled with powdered sugar and a side of syrup.
Can't wait to try the waffles wrapped hot dogs.
Thanks to a buddy posting the opening on fb ...I just happen to be in the area.

The food wasn't "bad,", but it wasn't great either.
The service was terrible.
For that reason alone, we won't be back.

Very cool and different place!
Waffles and hot dogs or both.
I'm not really a hot dog fan but the waffles are amazing!
They have a cinnamon flavor to them and you can put any toppings you want on/in it.
My favorite is peanut butter and honey.
Great price and quick service.
Definitely will be going back!

This place is so cool!
How some waffle poppers and took a journey around what they had to offer.
Very cool :)
