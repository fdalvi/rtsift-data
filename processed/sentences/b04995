Some of the staff is very nice and helpful.
This makes some visits quick and easy.
Other visits... we wait 10 minutes plus just to get acknowledged.
We can go to the cashier and have assistance paged for us, no luck.
For a chain pet store, this seems par for the course.
We go back because they have good prices for the feeder crickets we regularly need.
And despite these long waits, sadly, it is still better to go out of the way to this location than some of the other pet stores around our house.

They were Having a grand opening...this place has been here for years...so i did not understand that.but the staff is very friendly.
They had a pit bull adoption agency outside with some pit bulls that were too cute.They let you bring your dogs in.
We took our pit bull in to pick out a new toy,one of the staff came up and gave him a treat.

We just bought a new puppy and the staff here was extremely patient and helpful.
Not having much experience with puppies, the staff was a wealth of information.

This review was is for the grooming section.
The woman who trimmed my dogs nails was outstanding.
I have two Rottweilers that are anything less than cooperative.
She was able to calm them down as best she could and clip their nails.
Thank you so much for being patient with my doggies!
