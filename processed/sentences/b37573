Chef Robert is amazing!
The service was a huge help to me after having our first baby.
We had lunches and dinners prepared for us weekly.
The easy of reheating each delicious premade organic meal was a dream.
In less then 10 mins a complete meal was from frig to plate...
Especially wonderful when you have a newborn to care for.
Each week Chef Robert and Maranda would delivery the weeks worth of meals.
Real Organic Chef is a great service!!!
I recommend it time and again!

We found Chef Robert through his personal website, and hired him to provide meals for my parents (in their 70s) during a time of health challenges.
We live in California, and wanted to make sure my parents were getting the food and nutrition they needed, since we couldn't be there to help them directly.
Robert was the best!
He crafted a customized meal plan for them that incorporated all their favorites, plus introduced them to healthier, organic ingredients.
They loved the service, and couldn't stop talking about how wonderful and delicious the food was.
With Robert's approach, my dad was able to quickly and easily get a meal on the table in only a few minutes-- and this is a man that formerly only made sandwiches.
Amazing.
Beyond the great food, Robert won my family over with his personable and kind nature, and commitment to service.
We couldn't be happier, and highly recommend Chef Robert to anyone looking for a customized, healthy food delivery program.
Thank you, Chef!

He was incredible.
A group of us were staying at a house in Vegas for a bachelor party.
We hired him to make a meal for us after being by the pool all day, before going out at night.
The chef was fun, accommodating in every way, and put out some amazing food.
I 100% recommend him to anyone staying at a home in Vegas.
You have a much better experience, and actually end up saving money, by going this route.
Thumbs up!
