Good but not large, well-preserved and presented 17th century tenement in the Lawnmarket portion of The Royal Mile.
Enter through the authentic luckenbooth (what shopping used to look like back when) and follow a self-guided tour through the atmospheric period rooms.
There are staff in each room to answer questions and lots of interesting details.
The ceilings and walls in the painted chamber are worth seeing.
All it needs is the girl with the pearl earring.
I can tell there are other floors with more delights that are not on show and for the prices being charged, these ought to be on display as well.
It would be nice to see what became of these old houses once the great and good abandoned the Old Town for the spacious geometries of the New Town.
They should show what became of the tenements when hordes of desperately poor people divided and subdivided the floors into especially dire living conditions.
Most were finally swept away by the civic-minded Victorians.
Gladstone's Land is a remarkable survival.
I would like to either see its scope widened or its admission price lowered.
Better yet, a combined ticket to allow access to its sister museum, The Georgian House in Charlotte Square.
Both museums are must-sees for anyone curious about the real old Edinburgh.
