Jenna gives the best salon hair.
It took me over a year to find a great stylist, but she is a diamond in the rough.
Environment is very friendly.

I always leave here feeling like a new person.
And the bite out of my checkbook isn't bad.
Of course, I only know Angelica .
but completely and totally recommend her.

Launey cut my hair for the first time a few days ago.
His work is so good and he made great suggestions for changes to my short hair style that I really like.
I will go back for sure!

I've been getting my hair done by Launey for 10+ yrs now so clearly I like his work.
He  primarily cuts and styles my hair.
He also does one of my best friend's hair, a friend of my mom's hair and his sister used to do another GF of mine's hair before she moved.
The best thing I like about him as a stylist is that if you tell him to cut off 1/2 inch that's what he cuts no more no less.
Cutting "too much" has NEVER been an issue with him.
He's really good like that.
He is also the only person in town that I have found that can round brush my hair and it actually stays put.
With other stylists  they don't have that much strength in their wrist so they relay heavily on hair spray which I'm not a big fan of because after a 1 day my hair looks oily.
He's really cool about experimenting with different styles but make sure you know what you want before hand cuz I can guarantee you there is someone waiting after you and he's not going to have tons of time to help you decide.
Only negative on him would be getting scheduled.
Usually doesn't have that many openings and you have to wait a week or so.
He will not be able to do you on short notice so don't even bother.
Overall I have recommended him to several people.
