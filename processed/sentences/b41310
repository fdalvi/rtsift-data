They had been open 2 weeks when we stopped in.
The store is a little bare for now but they have a good selection of hardware and juice.
They have a taste testing setup with each juice in a clearomizer and a disposable tip cover.
We bought 6 - 10ml bottles of juice and we're happy with the taste and how it vapes.
Just a little pricey at $10.95 for a 10 ml bottle, I pay $9.95 per 12 ml bottle at my favorite vape shop.
But the juice is good and they were friendly, helpful and took the time to show us what they had.
They also said they have plans to sell larger bottles which should bring the price down.
I'd rate them as my second favorite vape shop.
Definitely worth a try.
Note to Synergy: The drip spout was completely missing off of one of my Synergy juice bottles.
Not a major deal, just an inconvenience.

I was just looking for a shop to pick up a coil for my atomizer and stopped in here.
The service was awesome.
I even tried some of the juice they make right there in the store and it was really good.
I highly recommend the Synergy Berry Tea.. Its a best seller for a reason.

Being new to the vapor world having people that are knowledgeable and make the entire experience enjoyable is really important.
Their liquid has exceed what I have tried in other shops.
My favorite flavors have to be syncafe, prime and wet melon.
This is a must stop when it comes to getting all my needs meet.
