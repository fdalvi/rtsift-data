Got my hair cut here today.
It was quick, inexpensive, and cut the way I like it.
Can't complain about that.

take my son to cut his hair not coming back here, they should paid me  by letting them learn how to cut hair, with my son the cut was horrible, I do not recommend this place

Just wanted a trim, got a quick perfunctory cut.
Grumpy hairdresser.

been getting my haircuts from here for past 3 yrs.ask for "Don" he is the only male hairstylist there so can't miss him.I have had my haircut all over town even from my wifes big buck place no one does as good of job as Don.won't go anywhere else.all you have to do is tell him exactly what you want and boy does he do an excellent job.other places will ask how much you want cut off for example you say like a inch but no more when your done you look and every time it's like 2 or 3 inches!
!why do they even ask?this won't happen here.Don's best hair stylist in vegas

Layla is my hairstylist, I have being here many times , it's always a deal,  I have long black hair , the cost to get my hair layered , blow dried and curled is under $40, what a steal.
My friend gets her hair colored here, and it's look amazing, she always the color right,  the location is convenient for me, as it is close to Starbucks , vons, etc, I usually make an appointment as my hairstylist is always booked up but today , I happened to call and I got in  It is good for walk ins, but I always see regulars there.
