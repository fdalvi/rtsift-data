So I'm sitting here...in the chair...drafting this review.
And all I can say is wow.
Just, wow.
Great staff.
Super polished facilities.
I bought a groupon for this place and so far so good.
This is an amazing concept for a locale like Scottsdale.
Polished is a cosmetic dentistry practice that only cleans($95), polishes($35), and whitens your teeth($95).
The whitening worked like a charm.
Side Note: I was super hung-over when I walked in the door, and they were quite understanding.
Amazingly friendly staff.

I've been wanting to try Polished forever and finally got around to it.
I'm really glad I went, and kind of bummed I waited so long to try it!
I'm very self-conscious of my teeth but I had a really great experience.
The staff is super friendly and they made me feel completely comfortable.
It took a few hours to notice how white my teeth actually were after, but there is definitely a difference.
My teeth were a little sensitive after, but my teeth are normally sensitive anyway and the staff explained all that beforehand too.
Overall I am very satisfied and would recommend this to anyone.

What a great concept!
A spa like dents that specialized in the ascetic aspect of dentistry.
The spa like decor makes me feel welcome and comfortable.
The first time I went in here, it was just by chance.
I needed a cleaning (well over due---not dental insurance).
Their prices were very reasonable and the staff was very friendly.
Eric did my cleaning---now I see him monthly.
I joined their monthly membership program.
I now get my teeth whited and cleaned periodically (each seririve is reasonably priced at $75 for members) and i get my teeth polished for free once per month (included in membership)!
I love the concepts of a "dental spa"!
