I visited their location on Hacienda to get an estimate and met the owner, you don't need to go to their location, they will come to you, but since I live close I did.I made an appointment to get 2 dents repaired.
The dents were repaired by Billy who has seventeen years+ experience, He was prompt and courteous.
When the repair was completed at my residence, I could not see where the dents used to be.
I am amazed how well paint less dent repair restores the sheet metal.
I did not have any paint damage from this dent so I opted to go the paint less option rather than a body shop sanding and filling in the dent, costing more money with inferior results this is my second experience with this type of dent repair and I highly recommend "Dentpro Of Las Vegas.

I was very upset when I noticed someone had "dinged" the passenger door my new car while I was at the market.
A friend suggested I call Ken at Dent Pro.
Ken was friendly and accommodating working with MY schedule.
The next day a service rep. came to my office and in less than an hour my car was new again.
The price is very reasonable and the workmanship beautiful.

I had a horrible dent in my 2010 MDX.
Dentpro fixed the dent and the door panel looks as good as new.
I recommend Dentpro to anyone who needs dent repair.
The staff is very professional and helpful.
I will use Dentpro in the future.
