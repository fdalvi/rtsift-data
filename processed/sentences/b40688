Excellent pizza especially for the price.
The garlic crust is very tasty.
Huge slices.

Great pizza, definitely better than dominos or Pizza Hut.
Plus you can get a pepperoni pizza with flavored crust for only 5 bucks.
Soo cheap.
I think my favorite flavored crust is prolly the ranch and the Cajun.
The ranch is the flavor I think you can taste the most the Cajun not so much, but still pretty good.
The chicken wings are also really good.
Usually get the mild bone in flavor.
They have an optional bone-in or boneless wings, which is nice.

For $5 a pizza, this is good stuff.
Got two single topping pizzas - one pepperoni and one Italian sausage.
A bit greasy but that's usual with pizza.
Service was great; cashier was very friendly.
Ready to go when I picked it up.
