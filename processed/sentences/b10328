Great Service and knowledgable staff.

Dr. Leavitt has developed a really great treatment experience at his office.
Comfort, safety, and competent treatment are at the core of his practice.
Every time one of my clients comes from Dr. Leavitt's office, they rave about how great it "feels" there, the doctor and the staff make them feel so comfortable.
To me that should be the goal of every medical practitioner and Tropicana West has it right.
Thank you for taking care of my clients!
I would recommend them to anyone in pain!
Bummer they just have one location- they are doing things right.

Dr' Leavitt has helped me in so many ways.
His treatment is fast, the staff is amazing, and everyone is so caring and kind here.
He has not only helped my back but also cured me of my hiatal hernia, neck pain, and rib pain.
Amazing place and great Dr.!
