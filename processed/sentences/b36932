They are a very conscientious place here.
I had accidentally not fully locked my unit and they called and let me know.
I was so grateful!

Safe, secure and gated.
Property manager Shirley is always helpful, friendly and keeps the place very clean!!
The $1 dollar move in deal is awesome and makes life easier when going through any move, business or home.

Great friendly fast service at this public storage in mesa!!
I will tell all my friends this is a great place to store their stuff!

Great customer service.
The facility is clean, secure and overall well cared for.
The staff does a great job.
I once left something sitting outside and the property manager found it and instead of throwing it away kept it and met me at my unit when I went back.

Great place to store my stuff I truly recommend this location friendly service too.
Will tell all my family and friends about coming here if they need storage.
Thanks Public Storage!

Found a very safe place to store my things while waiting for our house to be finished.
Location is perfect and close to the freeway.
Manager always willing to help and property very maintained.
Great place to store!
