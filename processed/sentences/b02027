A great place to stop off for a drink and the food is excellent!
Locally owned - a gem in the neighborhood

At the end of a long day and you want some great food in the neighborhood stay away from the chains and visit  locally owned Auslers Grill.
The daily specials truly are, do yourself a favor and enjoy one.

Changed to Native New Yorker - same owner (Rod Ticknor)
