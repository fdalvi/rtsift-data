Off Off Broadway is a great place for kids to learn more about acting, start to overcome shyness, or just have fun!
The owners are amazing, warm, talented people who genuinely care about kids.
They are engaging and energetic, and kids can't help but have a good time in their classes.
The main instructor is an experienced actor and school teacher whose knowledge of children and their development shows in everything she does.
My son loves "playing pretend" at Off Off Broadway.

Off Off Broadway is an incredibly cool place for kids.
It's unpretentious and imperfect, a perfect way for kids to have their first acting experiences... and judging by the "cast", there are plenty of older kids and teens/tweens here too.
The performances at the end of each 8 week session are absolutely laugh-out-loud hysterical.
The kids have such a great time and learn so much in these classes.
Jacque is funny and very, very likeable for even the shyest children.
We are fortunate to have a kids theatre like this in our community!

This is a great acting studio!
Whether the kids go on to starring roles in their school productions or just gain confidence in their everyday interactions, this studio teaches kids important skills in a fun way.
