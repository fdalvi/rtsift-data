I am not a fan of going to the bank, so service is key to get me in and out as quickly as possible.
My experiences here have been fairly painless although I dread having to park here.
They are located near a very high traffic entrance to the complex so no matter where you park you it can be a big pain in the butt.
Overall, this is a pretty basic bank.

I was told for the second time in a month the computer was not allowing to print money orders/ after waiting ten min in line to get one.
Where, they could've  tell every one or post a sign to notify the customers so, they don't wait...very bad service.

My favorite Chase branch, teller line always moves rapidly, plenty of parking in the parking lot.
If you need assistance to the manager will help you call customer service, or straighten out your accounts I go to Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Chase weekly, this branch is by far the best of the ones I go to
