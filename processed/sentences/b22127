Dan did a fantastic job on sealing/staining my freshly installed tile/grout.
He was able to do get the job done is a short period of time.
Dan was great to work and runs a top notch business.
I would recommend him to my family and friends.

Dan and his crew did an amazing job on the tile in my showroom.
They cleaned and color sealed the tile and it is 1000% better.
Still looks as good today as the day they did it.
I would highly recommend it to anyone with old, dirty, grout!

I tried to grout my kitchen and hallways myself with some premixed grout from Home Depot, talk about a complete nightmare.
My terrible DIY grout project backfired on me, I decided it was time for expert help.
I got a quote from a very well known grout company (not gonna say who) to redo the entire 500 sq.
ft. of floor and they quoted me about $2,700!
Thank goodness for Dan.. he had a light humor about the whole situation and really helped us out.
He quoted us for $975.. it was unbelievable.
I questioned the price, why you ask?
I don't know, for some reason, when the price is much lower, I tend to think lower quality(?)..
I questioned and doubted.
But Dan showed me some pictures of floors he had saved, and promised the floors would look great.
Well, he was right, not only did it take only a few hours for him to finish off the project, but it absolutely amazing.
Like a brand-new floor, grouted, sealed and cleaned.
Perfect!
He even said that I can make payments for the $975!
I can tell that he's a good, honest contractor that will not only do a great job, but cares about what he does.
I added a before and after picture just to show how he fixed my over-grouted, cemented, ugly project.

After having my office tiled, I found that the grout was nowhere near the color it should have been and did not match the grout color throughout the rest of my house, Dan did a great job staining and sealing my freshly installed grout.
I couldn't be more pleased and would highly recommend his company.
