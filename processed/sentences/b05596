Dr Herrero herself is friendly but I waited 2 hours past my appointment time (that took me 5 weeks to get), only to go in back and receive attitude from one of the nurses.
The nurse actually told me that it took so long because I'm a new patient, I'm not pregnant and Dr Herrero is the only OBGYN in Las Vegas that is female and speaks English and Spanish....  Um, yeah, doubt that one but okay.
I'll find someone else for my annual.

Dr. Herrero was always quick with my appointments and didn't take time to answer my questions.
When it came time to deliver, she didn't show up and I had a completely different doctor deliver my baby who was talking to me in Spanish.
Very irritating.
She had to discharge me from the hospital, but when she came in, 2 days after I delivered, I was in the bathroom and told her to wait one second, but she said no, she had other patients and I would have to wait until she left the office later that night.
(6 hours later)...Would not recommend her and definitely would not have her ever as my doctor again.
