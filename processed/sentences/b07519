They ae a small familyish shop.
They manufacture shirts, bags, target stands etc.
See their web site for more information.
http://thewilderness.com/  I've been going there for several years now and have the utmost respect for them and they really do stand behind their products.

Wilderness Tactical typically sells it's products through web sites and distribution to retail stores.
Their factory is in Phoenix, AZ which has a very small outlet store in front.
You can save shipping and maybe get a "seconds" deal if you can drive to the factory location.
Their products are heavy duty, over designed, rugged examples of the best American made quality.
Their motto is "Overkill never fails.
"  All of their products cost a bit more than flimsy Chinese imports.
You do get what you pay for.
I use their Wilderness Packer un-holster regularly.
It was developed to safely carry a handgun by mountain rescue teams.
It secures and protects the weapon while allowing rapid access if needed.
Other products include a gun belt - Instructors Belt - stiff enough to support pistol holsters and magazine holders.
Fashionable with casual wear, it is also TSA  friendly with no metal parts.
CCW friendly shirts, rifle slings, utility bags, pouches and backpacks are also manufactured.
Great products with patient and helpful store staff.

Great little place with super high quality tactical gear!
Not the cheapest, but they have the most durable equipment period!
Belts that can tow 8,000 lbs!!!
Awesome!

This is a great place to go for handmade, customized tactical belts and related gear.
The salesperson is very knowledgeable and walks you through the whole process so you get what you need.
And the price is only a bit more than other places but the difference in quality is very worth it.
Small, family business doing quality handcrafted products on site with excellent customer service.
