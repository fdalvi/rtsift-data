Formally the 'Waterloo Buffet' function room, in a former hotel at the East End of Princes Street, The Ark opened in July 2007.
It would be fair to say it perhaps opened a little prematurely, as there are still many aspects of the decoration which look a little unfinished, but musically the Ark is doing something right.
There are generally gigs on every weekend, plus some midweek gigs - the venue is usually closed Mondays/Tuesdays though.
Many local bands have now made us of the Ark and local promoters are beginning to utilise it for touring bands too, generally of an alternative/indie/rock persuasion.
Occupying the first floor of a narrow corner building, the venue itself is quite long and thin, the stage occupying the whole width of the wider end.
It's a pretty deep stage, and is just about tall enough to allow people most of the way back to see the performers.
At the narrow end is the bar, and windows which look right down Princes Street - quite a dramatic feature.
The Ark can only go from strength to strength as it gains a reputation, and hopefully this will provide the management to invest a little money in the decor.
It'll be great when it's finished...
