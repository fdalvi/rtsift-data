My daughter did a trial class and loved it.
We signed her up and she went to one class and then got scared for some reason and would not go back.
I understand they do not do refunds, but I just wanted to talk to someone about getting a partial refund or credit for my other daughter to do a class.
Even if they didn't let me get a refund or credit, I just wanted to hear from them.
I left 2 messages with people and 3 messages on their machine.
NO RESPONSE EVER.
Just call me please and let   me know either way.

The coaches are great!
They teach very well and they are a little strict, but that's the way I like it!
I want my kids to be great, but not have a coach as bad as Abby Lee Dance Studio!
Anyway, I do agree with Darcy's review, they "rarely" ever get back with you via telephone, but then again, if you are a good dance/gymnastic's studio, none of them do.
Only the studio's who are medioker will call you back because they "need" your business!
I love them but I am giving them 4 stars because maybe they need to hire someone who "only" works in the customer service department and doesn't spread themselves too thin coaching and trying to call people back!

My son has been taking classes here for almost a year.
The staff are professional, and really good with his age group.
(He is 3).
