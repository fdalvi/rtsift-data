For a lonely foreign boy needing a good cry, the vindaloo had me bawling like a baby.
It's been 10 years (1998) since I've been back, but it was a reliable go-to throughout that rainy, gray summer.
It also gave me a little cachet when passing judgment on the subcontinental food out west.
I mean, who's gonna go to South Queensferry, Scotland to challenge my credibility?
Nobody, that's who.

As far as I know this is the only Indian restaurant/takeaway I know of in South Queensferry but it does its job so well I doubt there is need for another.
Queens Spice offers a wide range of dishes with seemingly fresh ingredients.
Sitting in, you are surrounded by a really hospitable, welcoming atmosphere and the staff are really helpful.
The great bonus for me here is the wide selection of vegetarian starters and main meals.
I would recommend the sag aloo, a potato and spinach dish, heavily flavoured with coriander and mustard seeds.
Also expect to find your usual Indian curries here.
Prices are pretty good/average with starters costing £3.96+ and main courses around £7 or £8.
As already mentioned you can also order takeaway, and this is definitely something I would consider doing more regularly if I lived nearby.
The only odd, but not bad, thing about this place is the strange piece of fruit you seem to acquire when you order?
