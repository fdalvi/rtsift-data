Youll find this place nested in the corner where Mercer Ln meets 71st (just north of Shea off of Scottsdale Rd).
Its got a very basic boutique set up, but carries some very nice pieces from some very talented designers both local and otherwise.
I came here for a trunk show last week, and will definitely be back.
John was super nice and very personable, as was his cohort Heidi whos building a Mary Kay training center in the back portion of the boutique.
When I made my purchase, I received a $10.00 off coupon for the next time I come in.
John explained that everytime someone makes a purchase theyll receive that as an incentive to come back (great idea!).
I wish John all the luck w/ this place!
Stop in and say hi (and check out the pieces from Shawl Dawls in LA- love those gals!

BEST STORE IN AZ!
The owner is very helpful, loves to help his customers.
This store is the definition of good customer service!

This store is closing so I went in and everything was on sale.
I bought a really cute dress.
They have some beautiful designers and great, trendy clothing.
I love it!
