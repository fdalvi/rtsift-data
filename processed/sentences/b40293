Wow I got the cutest amazing necklace for my little poodle!!
She is loving her necklace and it was a great experience !!!
She customs made it right while I waited and it is adorable!!

The selection of jewels with which to create is phenomenal!
The staff is very friendly, helpful, and hospitable.
I spent a lovely girls day out making a fabulous necklace and also purchased something from her beautiful collection!
I could spend a lot of time here as Gulten Dye Creative Playground not only nurtures your creative side, but also has art from local artists to enjoy!
Can't wait to go back!

I went to Gulten dye and made a beautiful necklace, bracelet, and earring set it was so cool.
I set at the "Jewel Bar" for an hour found some beads and the sales people were very nice.
I wanna schedule my next birthday there they have really awesome jewelry parties.

Myself and a guest from out of town went to Gulten Dye on 6/24/14.
We were warmly greeted by the owner who gave us a great little tour of the shop.
We let her know that we wanted to make our own jewelry in the playground area (imagine tons of beautiful beads in a huge table with a recess in the middle.
) She had one of her employees come over to assist us.
The employee was very friendly and knowledgeable.
So why the one star you ask?
We picked out $70 in items we wished to purchase and I remembered seeing a coupon here on Yelp for a free bracelet if you checked in and gave a review.
I showed it to the employee who went and told the owner.
She began ranting and raving to her employee about people who use coupons and that she wasn't about to waste her time helping us make any jewlery.
I have never been treated so poorly for using a coupon.
I was humiliated in front of my company.
I will never set foot in this establishment again.
