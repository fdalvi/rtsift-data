We are real estate brokers with Coldwell Banker and we just had a client tell us that when they spoke with their insurance agent, he told him that he is unable to give him a quote for homeowner's insurance.
We told our client about Mike Pinta with American Family Insurance and within minutes Mike had helped our client.
Way to go, Mike.
We will refer you again and again.
You make our job easier!

Good company, great agent!
I have all of my insurance with the Pinta agency.
I recommend them often and will continue to.

I'm a residential real estate agent, so my business involves working with insurance agents often.
There is only one I recommend, though, and that is Michael Pinta with American Family Insurance.
He knows what great customer service means, and delivers it every time.
I have referred him to countless clients of mine, and will continue to do so.
