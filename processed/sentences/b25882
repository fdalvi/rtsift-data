This used to be a pretty nice gas station a few years back, but it has went way, way downhill and is overrun with street peoples now.
The last few times I've used this station I was approached by street peoples asking for change or a ride 2 different times, I was also approached by "sales people" that apparently are allowed to roam around the station and harass people about buying some stupid car wax (this also happened on two separate occasions).
Like I want to stand around and watch you give me a demonstration on how your wax works!
If I want to buy car wax, I go to a store.
I'm not going to buy it from some douche @ a gas station.
Please!
That's not all.
Tonight when I went to get gas, one pump is broken and another one has the screen broken with a note that says you must pay inside.
Plus the air/water dispenser has been out of service for weeks - no one apparently cares enough to fix it.
On the plus side, the Shell station @ 7th St. & Maryland is wonderful.
I usually go there, it's clean, everything works, no one approaches you, and they have a nice selection of drinks and deli sandwiches inside.
Staff is nice too.

This gas station does not allow you to use your card at the pumps.
Inside the station it always smells like ass.
The clerk never greets you either.
Apparently this gas station is the place to be... You can buy bootleg movies and other miscellaneous sh*t while you pump gas.
All kinds weird muhfuggas approach you selling their goods.
Also if you are pumping from the westside of the station you won't be able to see the door to the store because of poor architectural design.
there's a big column blocking the view.
this also blocks the clerk's view if something were to be happening to you while pumping gas.
I won't be stopping here anymore

The location is great, right by I-17.
However it could get loud, especially during rush hours.
If you are paying cash, you can just use your card outside at the pump.
But if you are paying with debit, then you'll need to go into the store to pay for it, kinda odd.
