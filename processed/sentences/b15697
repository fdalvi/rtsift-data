I don't know if we got lucky but we got seen really fast.
The only negative is that it took for ever for us too leave.
I sat around waiting my the desk to see when they would let us go.
So after about an hour of waiting I finally asked and the nurse just grabbed my hubbys folder and said you are go to go.
WTF waiting for 1 hour  The doctor was great I saw that he works for ACES he is not employed through North Vista.Very understanding and nice quickly diagnosed the situation.

What a crappy hospital!
They don't change bedsheet, have no consideration about patients or their time schedule.
They abuse insurance too.
Wanted my friend to stay for 3 weeks for no particular reason.
Someone please do something about this health care system.
These kind of hospitals should be shut down in a heartbeat.

I have been to over 5 diffent hospitals and this was by far the best.I had surgery and every single person was awsome from admitting ,xray ,ekg,the lady who took my blood,all the nurses in out patient all the way to my surgery.Thank You !!

Worst place ever I'm never coming back here again .worst place to bring anyone for an emergency this place is so un organized .
