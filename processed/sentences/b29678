I was diagnosed with Diabetes Type II, and had to start getting annual check ups.
The staff and the doctors were fast and efficient.
Then My Mother in law moved down to Las Vegas from Washington.
She had cornea replacement surgery before moving to LV and was unable to find a doctor that took her insurance and also would take over the work that another doctor had started.
So when it was time for my appointment I took a chance and asked if they took her Insurance  which they did; and they also had a doctor there that would take her stitches out and provide her with continued care.
AWESOME!

I had a wonderful experience at the wellish vision institute.
The staff is very nice and professional.
I was in las vegas visiting from california at a conference and I developed an eye infection.
Dr. Mattias is so nice and professional.
They saw me right away.
I really appreciate there high level of professional service.
I would highly recommend them

Growing up in a small town I was accustomed to receiving personalized service.
Since moving to Vegas that has been tough to come by.
So when I do experience it I am more than pleased.
Wellish Vision Institute is just that!
From the first meeting with Rebecca to the last appointment for follow-up I was treated like family and appreciated the knowledge and attentiveness that they demonstrated.
I received LASIK and couldn't be happier with my results.
Dr. Wellish is amazing!
He knows what he is doing and takes time to explain everything!!
Right down to the science and statistics!!
The office staff is no different, very helpful and accommodating.
If you are considering LASIK or similar procedures I highly recommend Wellish!
You will not be sorry.

Dr. Mattheis is one of the nicest doctors I have ever dealt with...he honestly cares!
I have had issues with Dry Eye & Double Vision.....both issues are now under control and I have him to thank!
He took the time to really figure out my issues.
