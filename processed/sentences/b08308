I hate dentist visits.
I mean, I REALLY HATE dentist visits.
I think more than most.
However...
I like this place!
Every single person, from the receptionist to the hygenist, to the Dr. is very nice and listens.
I have a few spots that are extremely sensitive, and they were probably the most "gentle" in dealing with those areas than anyone else I have ever been to.
They also took the time to talk, in depth, about my treatment plan.
It was not just a situation, like many in the past, where they presented you with a list of needed work, the expected charges, and gave you an appointment.
The staff really took the time to talk to you.
As much as I dread dentist visits, I am glad that there is a place like this where I can feel.....well.....comfortable.

This place is Great!!
They have been my dentist of choice for the past 10 years.
Dr DeBaker is a great dentist.
He is very informative.
Other staff is great too from the receptionists right down to the dental assistants and hygienists.

They got me in same day, SO THANKFUL the dentist and staff was funny and nice!
Then, I was still having an issue by no fault of theirs and they fixed it free.
So grateful they are here!
