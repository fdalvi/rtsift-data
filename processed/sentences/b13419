Came here while a robbery was in progress.
The cops asked me why on earth I would have come here alone (at 9pm, no less)  Avoid at all costs, unless you need more excitement in your life.

This place is disgusting.
The floors are an abomination and the staff is weird; even for a CVS.
There's one guy who looks like Gallagher in drag.
Weird.
The constant presence of crackheads and street whores in the parking lot makes getting back to your car an adventure.
