If you want the BEST yellow chicken curry in Madison,this is the place!!
Everything on the menu is delish,recently tried the seafood curry,AMAZING!
The decor is so cool and the owners are great!

Sala Thai is a hidden gem along the bike path!
Although I don't want others to know about my new favorite Thai place, Sala deserves some recognition.
I'm shocked that I'm only the second person to give a review.
The restaurant itself is small and charming, with a matriarch behind the register who seems to always have something interesting to say.
So far I've tried the chicken pad see ew and red tofu curry-both were delicious with lots of fresh veggies and full of flavor!
Just remember, they are a cash only business so plan accordingly!

A friend recommended I try Sala Thai- I am so grateful for the recommendation.
Sala Thai is a little hidden but worth finding.I agree with Jenny :I am surprised it has only two reviews, especially since I went there on a Tuesday, and they had steady traffic.
They have by far one of the best pork  friend potsickers I have tried!!
The panang curry was warm and had just the right amount of spice.
The Mango Sticky Rice absolutely yummy.
And of course had to get my dose of a thai caffienated drink- went with coffee instead of tea, it was really good too.
The service was friendly and quick.
I will be back when I make it to the east side again.
