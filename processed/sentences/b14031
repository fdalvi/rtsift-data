Gotta say, for a dry cleaner, this really is as good as it gets!
The service here is unbelievable!
When I walk in I am always greeted with a huge smile and warm welcome from atleast 1, but usually 2 or 3 of the people working there.
Seriously, you would think that this is the best job in the world from their smiling faces and positive attitudes.
I love it.
I always bring coupons so the prices are great.
They do a good job on the shirts - have only had 1 "issue" where the shirt had been pressed funny and had a weird crease, but they re-did for free, no hassle.
I know it's hard to get excited about a dry cleaner, but these employees do and it's contagious because I'm super excited to have them doing my dry cleaning!
Thanks Delia's!!!

Good dry cleaner.
Fair prices with quick service.
Customer service could improve.

If I could give 0 Stars that would be too many!
THIS PLACE IS A OVERPRICED LAUNDRY MAT, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR STAY FAR AWAY!
POOR Customer Service, Overpriced, Up-charges for men's pants with pleats (Seriously) are you kidding me?
They have been given 4 attempts to get starch on my shirts and failed miserably.
The owner states that some 100% cotton shirts don't hold starch well, Same shirts with other cleaners have no problem?
I could go on and on but unless you want to waste your time frustrated on a Saturday writing a review to warn other consumers, trust me go a mile down the road and find another cleaner...
