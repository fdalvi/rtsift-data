We came here for ceiling fans, and were more than impressed.
They have plenty of selection, and the purchase price comes with free installation (which for those not mechanically inclined like me is a great perk).
The customer service provided by them is second to none as well.
They helped us with fans for a new-build home we purchased, and the experience with them was so great I went back to them for fans for a rental property.
I highly recommend paying them a visit.

my sister and I found a fan we liked (a lot of variety) and then got to chose a really pretty glass for the cups, and better still ... we got to pick out the blades we wanted on the fan.
It comes with free installation (which only took them 15-20 mins to do), great variety and options, and great price!!!
Definitely going back!

They suck and free installation didn't quite turn into free installation because the kid had no clue what he was doing.
Unless he doesn't encounter one obstacle that fan is not going up.
Store owner recommended electrician they normally use.
Electrician comes out said kid didn't know what he was doing 75 bucks later fan up.
Called owner said he would look into it.
Call back said electrician told him he needed different type of screw....
I think they are both screwed up because he didn't use anything other than what came in box.
Owner rude and not customer oriented.
I would of and will from now on rather pay more for fan and installation then ever go back to this place.
This all stems from a incompetent kid sent out to install one fan and encounter a so called obstacle Sounds like laziness to me supported  by the owner This review is few months late
