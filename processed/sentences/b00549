Hmmm.
Well, if you're there as a trauma patient you'll be well taken care of.
This is definitely the old style of hospitals though, where you'll share a big room with 3 other patients, depending on what you're in the hospital for.

newly remodeled.
lots of parking!
Also known as county.

The RN Victoria on the fourth floor was very helpful and considerate.
My husband was admitted there for an infection, when he was transferred to the sixth floor she personally moved him up there and introduced him to his new RN Sam.
Sam was just as helpful and considerate.
James, the CNA was polite and funny.
As a whole this is one of the best, if not the best hospital in Phoenix!
Before discharging him the doctors made follow up appointments for him to make things simpler for us.
Thanks to the nursing staff and doctors at MIHS.
