Wanna fight?
Better yet, wanna have a drink in an old car wash?
Better yet, wanna help line the pocket of a real-live, Madison conservative...belly up to the bar, podner, Wiggies is your kinda place!

Tried to go here twice, both on Friday nights.
They were closed at 9:00 on one Friday night.
The second Friday night, we got there at 6:30 and were told the grill was closed because 'it had to cool down for an hour before they closed.
'  So bizarre.
Once you learn it used to be a carwash, you'll have a hard time imagining it any other way.
