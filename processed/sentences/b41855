I came in to Bud & Vine just looking to view the flower collection but I got so much more than expected!
I made a friendship with the shop owner, Christina, and found a nice place to spend time!
She was so sweet and helped me pick out a beautifully crafted bouquet!
I can't say enough good things about this flower boutique!
Flowers are so beautiful and can make anyone's day!
Make sure to stop by Bud & Vine for a great experience.

I had stopped in after hearing from a client what a hidden gem this little shop of beauties is.
I didn't have occasion to purchase the exotic and pretty flowers however there was much more to Christine's place!
Many gift, apothecary and beauty items abound from rare, cool brands!
I chose a couple and will be back for more.
It's a clean inviting space to browse and smell everything.
Had an endearing conversation with the owner that showed her dedication and passion for the field.

Bud and Vine is now four-for-four.
I've used them to send flowers to my wife and family and been increasingly surprised by each delivery.
To take it a step further, I had flowers delivered to my mom and rather than leaving her flowers on a 100+ degree doorstep to die a sure death before she got home, the owner of the store brought them back at 7:30pm WELL AFTER BUSINESS HOURS!
I've always sworn by Tiger Lilly and now this is my flower shop.
I would recommend them to anyone looking to deliver super contemporary arrangements.
Good people + good product + good service = lifelong customer.
