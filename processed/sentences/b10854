I have had many experiences with dentist in the valley and have never felt so well taken care of as I have here with Dr Catalano.
She is one of the kindest and sweetest dentists that I have ever known.
She helped me with my toothache and when another dentist told me that I would have to pull it she saved it, and its never felt better.
She has also seen my husband who hates dentist and she put his mind at ease.
My husband actually doesnt mind going to the dentist anymore, so this is a great thing.
Anyways I would recommend hospitality dental to anyone

I have been a patient of Hospitality Dental since I moved to the Las Vegas Valley in 2000.
The current staff is the best I have experienced; they truely care about their patients and are extremely thorough about their responsibilities.
Both Tammi and Dr. Catalano love their jobs, care about their patients, and take pride in doing each procedure to the fullest of their cabailities.
They actually strive to do all they can to make sure they only see you for your bi-yearly checkups; instructing their patients on providing and maintaining the proper care to their teeth in order to avoid unnecessary and avoidable procedures down the road.
I feel fortunate to be a patient.

Dr. Catalano and her staff are terrific!
They were on time as scheduled.
I was welcomed and even offered a blanket, in case I got cold.
They treated me with great patience as I am a new client.
I would gladly recommend Dr. Catalano in the future.
