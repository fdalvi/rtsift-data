I purchased a 2003 VW GTI for $1000 less than the "private party value".
They picked me up from the airport for free and pointed out an error I made when counting out the cash to pay for the car.
(I would have paid them $500 more and never known it).
I hate used car dealers and sales people in general, but I'll be buying my next car here too.
100% positive feedback on ebay is acurate when it comes to this business.
I'm still driving the car and I still love it.

This guy has a lot of good vehicles cheaper than most dealers and private parties however my experience with him was TERRIBLE.
I live up north in Cave Creek and he had a car I really liked so I called him to setup an appointment to see it and test drive it.
He was VERY reluctant to let me test drive it and VERY demanding of immediate cash (he repeated this to me about 5 times).
Anyway I managed to convince him to let me test drive the car without actually handing him a large sum of cash.
So I venture down 30+ minutes in Phoenix traffic and am able to look at the car but when I go to ask to test drive it.. NO!
Again he was going on and on about having cash in hand up front before i can even drive the car.
Now i respect why he is doing that.. however.. who on EARTH wants to pay for something without testing/using it?
Maybe it's me.. but I see a vehicle, especially one that I'm going to pay $6,000 or more on an investment.
So if you are the type who loves just randomly giving money away for something without using it or verifying it suits your needs.. feel free to give this guy a call.. he has plenty of good deals.. but if your like me and want to ensure you know what your getting.. look elsewhere.

Alan was unprofessional, uncooperative and downright mean.
Not sure what's up but I would avoid him at all costs.

NO STARS FOR THIS FRAUDULENT USED CAR SALESMAN!
The 2000 Porsche 911 996 I bought from Alan Monroe in February 2014 is NOT AS ADVERTISED!
It is not a SAFE DAILY DRIVER as Alan Monroe personally assured me before I ever submitted final payment.
With 72 hours of receiving the car in California, I asked and he agreed to take the vehicle back.
When I reported that I had made transportation arrangements, he reneged.
The following day he requested I have the vehicle professionally inspected by a certified Porsche mechanic.
He said he would consider covering costs of necessary repairs.
When estimate came in at more than the purchase price of the vehicle, including a new transmission!
($16,000.00+), he offered $1,500.00.
Now working with State Atty General Fraud Division, DMV, eBay, BBB, and have filed complaint against him to take him to court.
Alan Monroe of Arizona Wholesale Auto & Truck sold a LEMON to a buyer in California and the car will not CA State inspection!
BUYERS BEWARE!!!
