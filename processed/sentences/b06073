I try and stay away from Chinese fast food.
I don't know why... it's just who I am.
But, there are times that I can be purely lazy and have a hankering for some Broccoli Beef and steamed rice.
Anyhow, Panda Express is close and easy to get to.
So, here is my review of tonight's visit.
:   - I drive over to Sam's Town, which has the closest Panda Express to me.
I park in the 2nd parking lot, on the ground floor.
- I walk in to the North East entrance and Panda is right there on the left.
- There wasn't a line and I ordered my meal.
I had to wait a couple of minutes as they were replenishing their stock.
So, I had fresh Broccoli and Beef.
Woo Hoo!!!
- I paid and then left...  easy as that.
My meal was okay but nothing to give it 4 or 5 stars.
With that said, it's an okay place to go if you are in a hurry and are too lazy to make your own rice.

The food was very good and tasty.
Portions were big and priced reasonably.

Decent fast food Chinese food.
It's close to the house for those I don't want to cook kind of nights.
I will go back since the food is always good at this location.
