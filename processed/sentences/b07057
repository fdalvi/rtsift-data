The YMCA in Madison is a very old building and infrastructure, many of the other YMCAs in and around Madison have been updated, this one remains as is, it really needs a better location with a new building.
The cost per family is around $65 which is somewhat high for the quality of the building.
It is very difficult to get to it as you have to turn across a very busy street to get to it.
I intend on canceling our membership soon if they do not show plans to make significant changes.

Compared to the other YMCAs, the west side Y is well past due for a makeover!
The building design, location are definitely showing its age.
I recently visited the SP Y, and the difference is like night & day.
Its cleaner, brighter, bigger, better locker room and restroom facilities.
unfortunately, I live west and to make a daily trek to SP to work out is not worth the effort.
Getting in & out of the west side location is not very easy either.
Its too bad with aging west gate mall nearby, a newer, better west side Y could be built at that spot.

My son was signed up for one of their programs, and without notice they changed the time he could participate from evening to morning (before School!).
Total disregard for how unannounced changes will impact families.
