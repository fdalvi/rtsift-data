YAY!
Yummy Thai food close to  home in North Las Vegas finally!
Check this place out.

New place we tried close to our home.
Very friendly when we walked in to order take out around 6pm.
Ordered Tom yum soup, chicken red curry, vegetable Thai noodles, and eggplant tofu.
I've had many Thai resteraunts experiences over the years, and I have to say this food rocked, it's in a location difficult to see from the street  close to Ann and Simmons, which I hope people will take the time to find.
Portions were large and generous, fresh fresh ingredients with an awesome balance of spice chemistry, which with Thai food is sometimes off.
We had left overs for lunch and dinner the following day (two people).
So for $38 dollars that's an awesome deal In a n economy of finding good quality at a good price, we will be going back , and they have lunch specials for 5.99.
Give them a try , it may be a new hidden gem which will only survive once the word gets out.

I just called to ask some questions about the menu and was told by the person that answered that this restaurant has closed.
At the very least, the phone number posted is not their phone number any more.
