Paul and Az Uplighting did an extraordinary job at our open house.
He was professional and made our event a huge success.
I would recommend his services to anyone if they want that added touch to their event.
5 star rating from us at Wright Orthodontics:)

Arizona UpLighting provided uplights and a gobo for our event in Phoenix and Paul was amazing!
He showed up early, brought additional supplies, his prices are very fair and he stayed onsite throughout the entire event even though he wasn't required to just to make sure it went off perfectly.
He was patient and extremely helpful and made the whole process seamless and easy.
He has an eye for detail and made sure every element was perfect.
He is extremely kind and a pleasure to work with.
He exceeded my expectations!
I highly recommend him!

Paul with Arizona UpLighting was AMAZING to work with!
He answered all my questions, came up with great ideas and executed the lighting expertly.
Our bistro lights gave us just the right atmosphere we were looking for!
Guests stayed longer at the event and loved sitting under the lights!
