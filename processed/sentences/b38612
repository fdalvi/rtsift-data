Been coming here for years and love Dr.Pingol,she listens when you have a question and explains everything to you , also she dosent just rush you to go to the next patient which I like.
The staff is nice and the wait is super short, I've never waited longer than 30mins.

Do not go here.
I actually thought the doctor was good, but the rest of the staff is so horrible it doesn't matter.
I went two times the doctor was helpful, but followup and post care was a nightmare.
Manny the front desk gives wrong information about needing to come in and payments.
They seem to only really care when it comes to getting paid.
I had no help with refills for my medication which is standard and was told I would have.
The office refused to give me a standard doctors note (which my two previous doctors before moving were more than happy to help with) they refuse to let me speak with the doctor or explain my needs directly to the doctor.
They lose files, don't return phone calls, and when i expressed that I did not feel helped, Lynn in a very rude way told me to go else where and hung up on me.
I've never been treated by a doctors office this way before, i noticed many of their patients are elderly and hope they are not scammed.
bottom line the doctor shouldn't be nice just to get your money but follow through with care.
This doctor does not take any responsibility for her staff, but will take your money.
