Being that today is officially tax deadline day, I thought it was a good day to write a review of my life saver, the man who gives me a sense of relief at this time every year, my accountant, Michael Morrison.
Shout out to future yelper, Jeanie H, for referring me...
I have to admit that not only am I a major procrastinator, but I'm not the best organizer or record-keeper either.
Thank goodness that my AmEx sends me a breakdown of where my $$ goes every year - that helps me also.
For the past two years, I've gone into see Mike holding my breath that I will not owe any money, and both visits, he's done me good.
He knows what questions to ask and he's been in the business for years, so I know I'm in good hands with Mike.
I hear he's also good with non-tax related matters such as financial consulting, estate planning, and filing for an LLC.

"Three times a charm!
" - isn't that what they say?
It's tax season, so I just wanted to give my accountant a little Yelp love with an update...
This was the third year in a row I went to see Michael Morrison for my taxes, and once again...
I'm so happy and relieved to be done.
This year, I did it before April too!
Yay me!
Mike walked me through the process asking me every relative question and went through all of the paperwork I brought in... during the process, he was personable as well, telling me about his latest 1/2 marathon and about becoming a grandfather.
The office cat payed a visit as well - be forewarned if you have pet allergies.
About an hour later, Mike slid a piece of paper in front of me to show me the outcome of our meeting...
I took in a deep breath and looked down to see... A REFUND!
Thank goodness - I need that $$!
If you haven't done your taxes yet, call asap - I'm sure it's crazier than ever as April 15th approaches.

I am also a fan and a customer!!
Not only knowledgable in the tax arena but also did my LLC paperwork for a great price and points me in the right direction for anything to do with $$$$.
YES I got a refund too!!!
Mike is the man!!
