Freshly opened on Dundas Street, French Press is a chic little New Town cafe.
It's still finding its feet (it urgently needs someone to start providing them with soup!
), but has the potential to be a popular spot.
Overall, we said: "I think French Press has a little way to go, but it's in a lovely spot, has welcoming service, and is quite stylishly turned out, so has every chance to progress into a thriving little café.
It needs to sort its price-point, though, as on my journey to its door, I walked past a number of places providing three-course lunches for the same money they're offering you a sandwich and a pie.

I was having a leisurely wee stroll up Dundas Street back into town when I had an overwhelming urge for caffiene.
This happens often.
Then further up the street I spied what looked like the oh so friendly artisan roast symbol on a board a few metres up the street.
Deal.
So this little coffee shop, or cafe or whatever it wants to call itself is really rather handy.
They have delicious Artisan Roast, as I already mentioned, although the staff don't seem too confident in their coffee making skills which is a bit of shame?!
The sandwich and Pastry selection is maybe a little sparse, but other than that this little joint is exactly as yelp tells me - A-OK.

Like my second home... - fortunately it IS almost next to our house so I can drop in as I please.
The owners and staff are super super helpful and friendly but more important the coffee is out of this world and the food is amazing.
Nice sandwiches and even little hot snacks - always seasonal freshly locally sourced.
You will be pleased with whatever you get served.
The name French Press gives you the right feel - you feel like in a wee French café - relaxed and cool...
