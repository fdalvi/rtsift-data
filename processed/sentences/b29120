It's almost a surprise to find somewhere as unassuming and normal as the Coffee Mill on the West Port, which seems to be a hub for kitsch and quirky businesses.
Among the strip joints and second-hand bookshops, it's reassuring to know that there's somewhere nearby that just sells straightforward coffee and sandwiches.
Half of this shop is dedicated to take-away, half to sit-in tables.
It's always been quiet when I've been, making it an ideal spot to retire for a read of any recently purchased books.
The staff are always smily and friendly, almost to the point of excess, and there's something especially delicious about the coffee they sell.
The food they do is basic - baked potatoes, filled rolls etc.
- but makes a perfectly satisfying lunch.
All in all, there's not much more to say about the Coffee Mill.
There's nothing remarkable about it, but that's ok, some things don't need to be remarkable.

Friendly, bright little cafe on the West Port.
We had coffees and a couple of paninis with salad, both of which were fresh, tasty and clearly carefully made (which is saying something, paninis are ubiquitous these days and often tasteless and slapped together).
Really nice snack, we'll definitely be back when we're in the area.

After last night's whiskey binge, my dad and I wanted hot, nourishing comfort food for breakfast.
Unfortunately in the Grassmarket area that seems to be a challenge.
In our escalating panic and hunger we found only niche eateries: chain coffeeshops where students sit for seven hours drinking lattés, obscure looking cafés selling seventy kinds of coffee and three types of cold quickbreads, and a cake shop.
Coffee Mill saved us with their quiet, unpretentious atmosphere, great service, and big honking breakfasts: eggs, cheese, toast with generous amounts of jam, bacon, perfectly fried tomatoes, beans, steaming hot potato scones, fried mushrooms, and the morning paper.
Getting up from the table was a challenge.
It's a shame more folks don't eat here.

I was visiting Edinburgh with my family from California and we were trying to find a good and affordable place to eat since the exchange rate for Americans means we pay 1 and  1/2 more for everything.
This place was perfect.
The owner Gino was extremely hospitable and accommodating and the food was delicious with extremely reasonable prices.
I highly recommend this place if you are visiting on a tight budget or if you just want good food with great service at a good price.
