Came out to Boulder City to feast on some finger lickin' BBQ.
We walked around to see (and smell) what the vendors and competitors were offering...we ended up buying some Kansas City Style BBQ from Montana BBQ Company and some Local style BBQ from Ozark Mountains BBQ  Montana BBQ Company's Ribs were good, but Ozark Mountain's was left in the smoker a bit too long which ended up being a dry, over-smoked rib...
Overall, this wasn't as great as we anticipated it would be....Lucile's is just as good, if not,better...ALOHA!!

I loved this festival.
We were driving back from Hoover dam and got a little lost LOL.
And I am so glad we did because thanks to that we ended up in this place.
So we parked and walked to the festival, I got to try a few BBQ's and they were good, nothing mind blowing but they were good, I also had, for the fist time, a Texas tornado there.
Do not ask me what it is because frankly I'm not sure.
It is a drink with lemon, orange and lime, with some red liquid.
Hey I did my best to describe it.
I got a chance to talk with a few people and vendors about the festival, mostly because I had no idea where were we.
And everybody was really nice and cool.
They also had an antique car competition or exhibition that I enjoyed a lot.
Some really cool pick up trucks and antique cars.
The town itself is pretty cool.
If you get a change and want to try something different than the noise in Vegas by all means come here.
The weather was perfect for a festival like this.
Hot but not overwhelming.
Really enjoyed this festival.

Bring a blankey and/chairs, a hat or parasol, water, and wipes.
We had big fun!
The car show was pretty huge.
It's nice to see some new classics and rods.
Plenty of choices.
Too many to try.
It would be awsome if they offered bites,  like a slider, so you could try it all.
Spent the rest of the day at The Coffee Cup.
I absolutely adore BC, and I will be back, next year, for some more Dam BBQ.
