This is a pretty standard food court Subway with supra-standard prices.
I guess that's what one should expect here on the strip.
Certainly one can get a footlong sub for 1/3-1/4 the price of a buffet - but do you really come all the way to Vegas just to end up eating at subway?!
Well, if you're on a budget and looking for a healthier option than Sbarro, Panda Express, Johnny Rocket's, or if you're actually tired of gorging yourself at the Bellagio buffet - or if you're like me and all of the above apply, then yes.
Subway it is.

At the Subway in Ballys I met an extremely rude food server.
I asked to try the broccoli soup.
The soup was all cream so I asked him why.
He said we are out and I asked if he was getting more.
He said well it will take a few minutes.
I said ok I will wait.
He rolled his eyes came back and said we don't have any need to thaw it out.
I said ok how long.
He again shrugged and said will be awhile.
The female working said the soup is often watery just comes that way sometimes.
I said to Saui if you don't care and don't want to sell me soup just say so but to date you are the rudest person I have met in Vegas.
His response was there are other Subways in town go find one.
I am shocked a brand such as Subway can employ 2 rude and non trained staff.

This was the worst subway experience.
Amazingly skimpy with veggies.
They added 2 slices of each veggie for a foot long sandwich.
Very sad

Ordered a 12" tuna sub.
The sandwich maker went out of her way to make sure that I didn't get any extra tuna, going so far as to scrape any tuna clinging on the outside of the scoop onto the storage bin side.
12" tuna sub with meal deal= $13.00.
Most expensive I have ever bought.
Never again at this location.
