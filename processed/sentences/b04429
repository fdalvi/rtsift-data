Probably the best Del-Taco within a significant radius in this part of town.
This place is the cleanest, with nicest staff, and food is much faster and better tasting for fast food.
It's the closest to how I remember del Taco being a decade ago when I first tried them.
For the exact opposite experience, go to the one on 59th ave & Beardsley.

I ordered a burrito from here and the sour cream was literally curddled into a cottage cheese looking substance.
I got a couple bites in before I saw it, and I immediately almost vomitted, along with everyone around me that saw it.
Never again will I dine there, you don't even get the chance to make a mistake like that again in my book.
I did not get sick, thank God, but still, gross.

Ripoff alert!
Went through the drive-through, and ordered the Thursday taco special for $2.09.
Paid with a five, received 56Â¢ back, and no receipt.
Hmmmm.
Not only a ripoff, but the food sucks too!
