I don't come to Dansey's much anymore but this used to be my favorite hobby shop in Las Vegas.
It was my first choice for model rockets and supplies.
I preferred their old location on North Nellis Blvd.
It was bigger.
The selection was greater.
And they used to have an indoor dirt race track for R/C cars.
It was so much fun to go in there and watch the races.
The newer location now is alright.
It is not as big and parking can be a challenge being in a tiny strip mall.
The staff has remained friendly and the prices fair.

hard to find parking but they have a nice selection on RC parts and a few RC cars.

Dansey's is closed.
I don't see/know of any forwarding information.
