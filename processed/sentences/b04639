Walgreens is a one stop shop for anything you need to pick up if you don't want to go hunting through a huge grocery store.
There have been many of times when on the way to a party I've forgotten to get a card and swung by my local Walgreens.
When I went to this particular Walgreens they were all out of the product I came there to buy.
Considering there was another Walgreens right down the street I didn't put up a fuss about the shelves being cleared.

Very convienient and close to the house.
Customer service is great here and if there is a line, an employee will open up another lane.
The prices just cannot compare to Walmart or Fry's.

Our local Walgreens!
Kinda of funny!
Especially when there is a Walgreen or CVS on every block!!
We come here a lot, never had any problems, customer service is really good.
We come here a lot to develop our pictures, and during holiday seasons when they have their seasonal sales.
They do tend to be on the more expensive side, but that is expected.
Overall it does it's job, and services my needs.
