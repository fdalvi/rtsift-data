Shortly before my mom died, she told me to entrust my skin care to Monica.
It's true.
Not that it was her dying wish or anything weird like that.
Mom gave be all sorts of pearls of wisdom, and that particular one just happened to be about skin care.
That was a decade ago and I have followed mom's advice to the letter.
And you know what?
I continue to get compliments about my "peaches and cream" almost every week.
That's pretty awesome, especially since I'm now a middle age woman.
Monica and the gals at Healthy Glow offer the most up to date skin care services such as microderm abrasion, chemical peels, light therapy, and incredibly soothing and moisturizing facials.
This place isn't one of those fancy schmancy salons.
Healthy Glow is run in a professional healthcare environment.
In fact Monica's sister Dr. Teresa Vesco shares the same office and is a successful naturopathic medicine physician.

Ladies, you know how hard it is to find an amazing eyebrow waxer!
There's no need to search hi and low anymore!
Monica is BY FAR the best...
EVER!
She's been doing this over 20 years or so and she's seriously amazing!
I've been going to her about 5-6 years now and I won't go anywhere else!

I just had my first facial with Monica and I have to tell you it was amazing, I already booked for next month.
She has a strong mastery of skin care and knowledge.
I had a classic facial and highly recommend.
