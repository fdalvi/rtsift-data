If you are a fan, you will love this place.
It's so cheesy you will explode with glee.
While I was there, I was looking around the museum and this blond lady is standing at a table with photos from Kissing Cousins and says "that's me with Elvis.
" Bizarre!
It's what I go to Vegas for.
Of course if you're looking to be cosmopolitan and completely chic--avoid this place!
It will debunk your high social status.
Moving on.
The impersonator show is awesome.
Our guy was really into it.
Donnie Williams was his name.
I may have messed up his last name, but it was worth seeing.
The little lounge they perform in is very cool and red.

What a great memory!
Since my Dad was a huge Elvis fan and I grew up on his music, I felt obliged to visit!
The museum itself was okay, and the shop offered some great gift a for an Elvis fan, but the absolute best part was the live show!
We heard that we got the "good" impersonator, but man, he was excellent!
I felt like a teenage girl in the front row!
I *think* his name was Donnie.
The show offered service to and from the museum,  which was great in traffic!
