First of all, this place is called Hong Kong Gourmet.
Although it IS a buffet, it is not to be confused with the Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet in Chandler.
The last time I went was on New Years Day with my bf and my brother.
They both consumed much more than I did, however, I can tell you that I enjoyed it thoroughly.
It is the perfect place to go to cure your hangover on holidays as such.
Hong Kong Gourmet features not only a full buffet with your standards of Sweet and Sour Chicken, Orange Chicken, Broccoli and Beef, egg rolls, etc.
But there is also sushi and a salad bar.
To top it off, there is a full Mongolian bbq area and deserts.
The service is great.
I have had the same female server each time I have been and she is on top of her shit.
You never have to ask for a new drink, one just appears magically at just the right time.
While the interior (or the exterior) isn't impressive in terms of presentation/ atmosphere, it is spacious and the food is always kept coming out.
The only thing that would make this place better would be free WiFi.
That way you could gorge yourself all day long and geek out at the same time for under $10.
Oh and for all of you Light Rail Riders- it's right along the path.
Check it out.

omg this place is amazing...Sushi is the best I've had!!
Didn't think I'd ever say that about a buffet place!!
It also has everything made to order if you don't see what you want.
I love shrimp and crab and they had plenty of it!!
:D I'd definatley go there again I just wish they were closer to me!
