I have to give this little gem five stars, as I just can't think what more I would ask of a neighbourhood restaurant.
I've been twice in the past month or so, once in a party of ten and once with four.
Both times every single person had little but good to say about everything they chose, which in this company I can assure you is unusual to say the least.
Add to a pleasant environment, very friendly and helpful staff, and very reasonable prices overall, and it's a very firm favourite.

I came to The Olive Branch Bistro in Bruntsfield on Saturday at about 6pm with my mum.
From the menu outside it looked pretty expensive with with some mains costing over £14, but we saw that we were just in time to get the two course lunch menu which came in at £11.95 per person.
We were there before the earliest of their bookings for that evening and so we were easily seated and got quickly by the friendly French waiter.
I ordered the smoked chicken starter and the sausage and mash for a main which were both great tasting and pretty filling.
Whilst we waited, however, we could hear in meticulous detail the banter which the chefs and waitress were having in the kitchen.
It was pretty funny for a while but eventually started to get wearing.
The food didn't take long to arrive and there was no doubt that it was great quality.
My mum ordered the ravioli for her main and, whilst the portion size seemed ridiculously small, she said it was great.
The Olive Branch is expensive, but despite the portions not being enormous it still offers excellent food and service to match its prices.
