Enter Spring Training Festival 2013...
Okay, so I am not a fan of baseball.
However, I don't dislike the sport just neutral.
So, when I'm in Old Town Scottsdale, and through walking around I find out there is a festival.
I think, why not?!?!
I'm up for all types of experiences!
Entrance $5 kids under 12 Free!
There are beer vendors and food vendors, and vendors to sign you up for cable.
You know how how it goes.
But, I had no idea they would have Rollie Fingers Hall of Fame 1992 3X World Series Champion 1981 AL CY Young/MVP.
And, for only $20 you can have a basebal signed and take as many pictures with a smart phone as you want.
And, right next to him...care to guess?
Gaylord Perry Hall of Fame 1991 314 Wins 3,534 K's 1972 AL CY Young/1978 NL CY Young.
That in itself was worth $5 bucks!!!
Oh, they also had a live band in the middle of the park.
Some songs were better than others.
Overall not bad.
Should I be in Scottsdale again around this time.
I'll make sure to experience the Spring Training Festival again!

We were there early (around 2 o'clock) and it was pretty quiet.
It's definitely geared towards kids and familes, and the band even had some kids dancing up on stage.
Some retired baseball start were there, like Rollie Fingers, which was very cool.
All-in-all a good little warm-up to Spring Training.

Loved EVERYTHING about it!
Can't wait to go back next year.
