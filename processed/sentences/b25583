Was craving a torta very badly and the only other place nearby I know that served them was Tortas Paquime, but was never really impressed with that place.
So, I decided to give this place a try.
El Tri definitely knows how to pack them!
I ordered 2 Arizona's to go and a quesadilla with the words.
Quesadilla was so large they had to put it in a pizza size box!
Tortilla was handmade and warm.
Pretty tasty!
Tortas were huge, I only ate half of mine, but my husband was able to finish his entirely...although, he dropped into a food coma just seconds after polishing off the whole thing!
Will definitely come back and try another one of their sure to be delicious tortas.

Dropped in for lunch with skeptical feelings I get with new places I have not tried yet.
Came out with plans to eat here when ever I have a craving for Mexican style food.
Staff is great food is amazing, even kids loved it and they hate everything.

It was the middle of the day and I was on my way to get a burrito from Chipotle when at the corner of my eye I spotted this place close by which looked sad and empty from the outside so I decided to give it a shot instead.
In no way do I regret my decision; it's great for a quick delicious Mexican dish or perfect for takeout orders.
But what I recommend most and others will testify as well in that "Tortas El Tri" has the best tasting tortas of this side of west Phoenix.
