I was so excited when I was their store sign go up!
I usually get my flavored oils and vinegars while driving thru Cottonwood once a year.
I'm so glad i can now purchase them locally.
I love that you can taste the flavors before purchasing.
The owners, local Laveen residents, are friendly and love talking about how to cook with the oils/vinegars.
I have purchased four flavors and use them for making salad dressing, for dipping bread, and as extra flavoring for grilling veggies.
I also bought a dessert vinegar that I like to pour over fruit.
Yum!
I saw the owners at a local event, Second Friday Laveen Art Walk, and they mention that they now offer  their space for events and small parties.
Great for a girls night out, wedding shower, etc.
You can byob.
You got to check them out!

So hard to choose from all of the wonderful oils and balsamic.
Very friendly and helpful owners as well!

If you want the variety of oils and vinegars, this will be the place to go.
Great products and the owners are great people.
Check them out.

I loved this place and was so sorry to see them close!
I don't know where the went or if they even re-opened somewhere, but the selection of handcrafted oils and vinegars was stunning.
