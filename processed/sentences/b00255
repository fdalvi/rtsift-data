What a treasure, right on the edge of town.
My daughter went to camp there and they engaged the kids in lots of fun activities.
The snacks weren't the healthiest, but the staff were knowledgeable and good with kids.
We also went to their fall festival and my kids had a blast.
The activities are fun, yet educational.
The nature preserve is open and free for all.

My son went there on a class field trip.
Friendly and passionate staff.
Great place to learn about nature and for "planting the seed" of protecting/respecting the environment.
