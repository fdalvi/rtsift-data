Poverty Pets is truly an amazing organization that we recently adopted our dog from.
The story behind our pup was so sad, this little baby was found alone, dehydrated and sick on the street so they grabbed him, immediately took him to the vet to get treatment and fostered him until we were lucky enough to run across his precious face!
The previous post from Lisa F. pretty much covers what PP is all about, we would absolutely recommend them to anyone looking to adopt!

The vet down the street had referred me to Poverty's Pets, as we had found an abandoned doggie.
I had not heard of Poverty's Pets before, so I checked out their website and was moved to see how much they have helped other dogs.
I met up with Kim, for some assistance in placing our rescue for adoption -- she was AMAZING!
No, like seriously amazing......   Great organization...make sure you like their Facebook page.
I love, love, love seeing all the great work they do to help connect doggies with "Forever Families".

This is great every dog should have a wonderful home, my dog is my best friend,

We recently adopted our 2 yr old dog, Cali, from Poverty Pets.
What a great experience.
We already had 2 middle aged cats and decided to try a rescue organization as opposed to the Humane Society, simply to get a better background and idea of temperament prior to bringing a new dog home.
Poverty Pets not only recommended the dog who we eventually took home, but they also offered a foster-to-adopt program so "testing" could be done on both sides before exchanging any money or making any final decisions.
And they even provided food, leash, and a kennel during that time!
Kate was so easy to work with throughout the process, and we ended up with an absolutely wonderful dog out of the deal!
We still cannot believe she was a rescue dog!
We would love to take the credit for her great temperment and big heart, but we simply cannot.
Thanks Poverty Pets!
