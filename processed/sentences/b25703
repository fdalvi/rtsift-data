good service & clean but food was sub par.
we were disappointed & would prefer other cafes in the area over this one.
pancake were OK but potatoes and corn beef hash were dry & flavorless.

I firmly believe everyone is entitled to a "bad day", so I'll count this as Linda's Hoosier Cafe's bad day.
Went in for breakfast the first time hoping to have the same level of service/food quality at the other place called Hoosier Cafe on Warner.
Didn't get even close.
The goods: Waitress was an absolute sweet heart!
Place seemed really tidy and well kept.
The prices seem really reasonable.
There was a good selection of breakfast "specials" posted up front.
The bads: The food took FOREVER to come out.
My over medium egg had runny whites.
The bacon was thin and nearly flavorless (cheap bacon probably kept too long in a steam table).
I love me some bacon, and the fact that I didn't even eat more than 1/2 a piece really says something.
My coffee cup went empty several times before I got refills.
The syrup served with the pancakes was awful.
It was very bland and tasted more like Karo syrup with brown coloring as opposed to maple syrup.
I know REAL maple syrup is expensive, and for the price I wouldn't expect it here, but jeez, spend a little more on some higher quality syrup please.
Mrs. Butterworth's would have been better.
Even the Tabasco sauce was sub-par.
The bottle label was all faded and peeling, making me think this place refills with watered down Tabasco.
Is that even possible with the tiny bottle openings?
All that said, I will go back and give another chance because the waitress was so nice and apologized for the syrup and slowness with the food.
I also want to try the B&G.
I think this place could be really good if the management would heed all the negative comments and make some modest changes.
