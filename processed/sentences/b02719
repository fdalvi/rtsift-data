I went to get lunch around 10:26 and there's always some kind of hassle with these people.
The rude woman in drive thru said we're not serving lunch right now.
But when I went to the same place 3 weeks ago they started serving it at 10:20 WTF ????
I left this dump.
What a lousy way to start the day.
Cocksuckers !!

They can NEVER get your order right!
The staff is rude, but if you call to complain they leave you on hold forever!!
Won't waste another dime in this DUMP!

Luckily, I beat the rush, because after I ordered, there was a huge line behind me.
I was craving chicken nuggets, so I ordered that and some French fries.
Chicken nuggets were great, but the fries were unusually salty, limp, and soggy :/.
I love the convenience though and the staff was nice and smiling.
