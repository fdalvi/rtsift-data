They have been opened since May '09, but I just found them a couple of weeks ago through Restaurant.com.
I originally wasn't going to eat here because there is already a lot of pizza and sub restaurants around town.
But after reading over their menu, there were several things that sounded really good, so we tried it.
Am I ever glad we did.
I don't know about the pizza - even though I overheard one of the customers saying his pizza was "really good".
My wife and I had two sub sandwiches....and Oh My was it GOOD!
We both got a "pounder" sandwich, which is a pound of meat and cheese on a 12 inch roll.
I got the BBQ Beef - one pound of steak with BBQ sauce, cheese and onion rings.
My wife got the "qualifier" - one pound of steak with provolone and tomato.
They give you a big basket of fries to go with it!
The fries were not so good, but the sandwich was one of the best we've had.
Very soft bread and TENDER steak with no fat or gristle.
It was more than we could eat - but we tried!!!
The only downside was the wait.
They cook the steak when you order, so it is fresh and hot - but it took almost 30 minutes to get our food.
Next time we will call ahead.

Not bad pizza.... Service is below par
