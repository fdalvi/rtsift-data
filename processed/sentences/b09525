I ordered custom interiors for my new Juke.
Floor mats, seat covers, dash cover, and even extra fabric to make a mat for my Standard Poodle, who rides in the entire back.
They were very patient in helping me pick out fabrics, did a great job creating the interiors, and installed everything beautifully.
And the car looks way cool.
Zebra print!

First contact was great.
The customer service was excellent but the product did not meet the standards set.
I ordered a custom dashmat in a suede finish for my vehicle and waited a week for it to be made.
The fit was not very good to my dashboard and the quality was lacking.
I paid $54.99 plus tax and was sorely disappointed.
The stitching was sub-par, it was about 1/2 inch too big, and after speaking with them, I was told that it was perfect and no alterations would be done.
Luckily, Laura was very professional and understood my concerns and offered up the option of returning it.
Laura gets 5 stars, but the product was 1 star for the price.

Since they are local, I drove down to order a dash board cover.
I chose color, options and paid the $60.00.
They said they would call me when it came in.
About 7 days later I received the call and went down the next day.
( each trip is about 30-miles one way)  I went there and chose for them to install it.
I waited and watched through the door as the installer was struggling with the installation.
He called out several people to look at the cover.
After about 30-minutes, they finally came in to tell.
Me that they need to re-make the cover.
It didn't fit.
They told me about a day or two to make its.
I told them not to rush.
I was going out of town for a few days and would come back when I returned.
About 4 days later I called to see if it was ready for me to come down.
After waiting on hold, I was told that it wasn't ready and it would be ready in two days.
I called back in two days and was then told that they don't have the correct material any longer.
It would be about 4-weeks.
BS!!!!
I told them what I just want my money back.
They said that would be OK.
I told them I would come down tomorrow.
When I got down there, I was told that I didn't need to come down, that they already credited my card.
ARRRRGGGHHH!!!!!!
Why didn't they tell me BEFORE I drove all the way back down there.
All I can say is, " thank God I didn't by this on-line"  Will not use them again.

Excellent product.
Fits like a glove.
Looks good in my car.

Just received and had installed new dash  (Sedona suede) for my Infiniti FX35.
Came in a couple of days later than they originally promised but no big deal.
They installed it for free and the gentleman was meticulous with the installation.
Would definitely recommend.
