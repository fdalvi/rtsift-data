I have been a patient of Dr. butler for over 10 years.
My insurance changed and I just needed to see Dr. Butler for a routine visit to refill a Rx.
Since they do not take my new insurance, they refused to see me even though I was more than happy to pay all bills out out of pocket.
I am extremely dissappointed with the lack of concern for a loyal patient.

Could not find out what was wrong with me.
Bad bedside etiquette.
Never found out what was wrong with me after 20 visits, always felt rushed and that he had better things to do.

Dr Butler is not only a great Doctor but actually cares about his patients.
He takes the time to listen and make an educated diagnoisis.
Thank you Dr.  Butler for making me healthier and happier!

Dr. Butler has always been very professional.
For physicals, his office takes the time to do all of the proper tests and doesn't just check your heartbeat and send you on your way like most Doctors.
