Annie's is awesome.
We take our dog Daisy  here on a weekly basis to get groomed.
They do a great job and they are very attentive to special requests.
(Cutting her toenails makes her chew them so no more of that).
She always comes home with a different bandana, holiday/season themed, which is a nice touch.
I recently took our puggle to get her nails trimmed (trust me that is no easy feat).
They did a great job and only charged me $5.
I highly recommend Annie's to anyone in the neighborhood.

Sorry Annie but I'm docking stars.
While the grooming continues to be well done the new cash only policy is frustrating.
The last time I came to pick up Daisy they told me the debit machine was down.
I had no cash and asked if I could pay them next time, they said no and that I could come by anytime before 5 to drop it off.
It was an incredible inconvenience and considering it was their fault I couldn't pay they should have let me pay the next time I came in.
As previously mentioned I have been bringing Daisy here every week for over a year.
It has been about a month now and the debit machine is still "down".
They have lost my business and I will find another place to take the dogs.
If they show me no love why should I continue to give them my money!

Annie's Pet Parlor has always impressed us.
They are kind and gentle.
We plan ahead so paying with cash has never been a problem.

We have a big old Old English sheepdog.
They did a wonderful job with him-besides looking "gorgeous", he was relaxed and seemed to enjoy the experience.
Length of time and price also a plus.
