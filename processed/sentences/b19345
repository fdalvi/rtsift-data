I love the classic Catherine Malandrino dress, and if you're looking for a non-elaborate one, this is a great place for you to go.
Dresses that are normally $425 are reduced to around $250.
Still pricey, but a large discount.
If I didn't already have one of her dresses, I would have gotten one.
Awesome store!

WOW!!!
They have a Catherine Malandrino Outlet!?!
*Happy Sigh* *Unhappy Sigh because I still couldn't justify buying a dress and I couldn't lug it back...*

I love this store.
Malandrino dresses are classics.
I love the bright colors and the weight of the fabrics.
The stitching is impeccable and the prices are far less here than in a boutique or any department like store.
Some dresses are priced at 50+% off.
That is amazing.
I wish I had pictures of the showroom.
The store seems so empty but really, everything is just kept so neat and clean.
It's always a nice trip to the Malandrino shoppe.
The sales associate didn't talk much but I think part of the reason for that is that the dresses and other items just sell themselves.
It really is about the name and the quality.
You wouldn't be disappointed.
