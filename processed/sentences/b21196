This is a relatively small branch of Jane Norman but the staff are friendly and the store is well stocked and very well organised too.
I've always found Jane Norman to be a little bit hit or miss and some items can look more than a little tacky.
The price also never seems to correspond to the quality.
I have a friend who adores it in here though and she is as far from tacky as I can imagine so she seems to pick out the best of the bunch.
I recently picked up a pretty yellow cami from here and at Â£20 I thought that was very reasonable, you also get student discount.
I have to admit, although it's very pretty I'm not sure how many washes it will last as the material is quite flimsy.
