The location on Main St is now closed and moved to 63 N. Greenfield Rd.
Ste 101 MESA, AZ 85205.
It is what it is - cheap pizza delivered.
It's one of the few places that delivers to my address and for that they get the 3rd star and a 4th star because they are always quick and friendly.
I'm not comparing the pizza to "good" pizza, but when I have a taste for greasy and salty pizza, Papa John's fills the need cheap and quick.
What more could I ask?

Pizza was fair to poor; wings were inedible and took them back; I was told I needed to order "well done" if I wanted them cooked through.
I was given replacement order - same problem - undercooked.
Establishment accepted complaint but I got the impression I was the "heavy" and each staff member witnessing my complaint gave me the "eye" like I was not credible.
First Papa John's experience and the last for sure.

It's your average pizza chain.
You know what you're going to get.
Online ordering makes it easy, and if the Dbacks win the previous night, using code DBACKS50 will get you 50% off original prices.
That's the only time I will order from here.

It's hard to be consistently disappointed when you're already expecting mild disappointment, but you've managed to do just that Papa John's.
Orders jacked up more than once; deliveries running 15 minutes late like it's your job...
But tonight was the last straw.
Almost an hour late for mediocre (at best), middle-of-road, national chain pizza on a Tuesday (meaning no major pizza consuming televised sporting events) evening - horseshit!
I'm done with you.
When I want to be disappointed in shitty pizza, I'll use your location on Mesa and Brown.

Got good pizza here a couple of times and then something happened.
Last 2 times I ordered it took forever.
80 min.
today instead of the 30-40.
Even got a medium pizza instead of a large, cold and undercooked.
They said they will credit me but I am still upset about having such an awful meal.
