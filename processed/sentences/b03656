Wow - John and Rob were my saviors!
After months and months of wedding planning, flowers were the one thing that I put off.
I checked out several different places and didn't have any luck finding someone who would work with a limited budget yet still be able to create something beautiful.
I had just about given up until a friend mentioned Flora Bella.
I called and told them my dilemma - my wedding is in two weeks and I have a small budget!
No worries, they said, we'll take care of you....and that's what they did!
We worked together to create a simple and elegant centerpiece and gorgeous bouquets.
I received exactly what I wanted for a reasonable price, and couldn't have been happier!
On a side note, they aren't necessarily in the store or available by phone during their business hours but rest assured, if you leave a message they'll get right back to you!

Flora Bella really rocked!!!
They did an amazing job on the Ronald McDonald - A McNight to Remember Gala this evening.
Thanks Rick and Krista too - you guys kept us laughing.
The decor set up was flawless and they delivered beyond expectations.

More than florists, they are wizards and creative masters.
Have designed several charity events for our group ( ballroom & table decor, as well as the look of the entire event).
Always create a gasp of WOW when our guests walk into the room.
From start to finish, John and Rob are pros and a delight to work with.

I wish I could give Flora Bella a "Minus Star" rating.
My wedding is this Saturday, I just received an email from Rob saying "oops, I just found your paperwork -- FROM JANUARY -- guess we dropped the ball and aren't doing your wedding.
"  Ya think??!!
Despite my venue -- Sanctuary on Camelback Resort -- recommending Flora Bella, and their agreement, in writing, to be the florist for my wedding, these guys completely dropped the ball.
Failed to send a proposal, or contract, left me hanging for over a month...
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND FLOWERS BY JODI!!
