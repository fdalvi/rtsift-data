I have been going to BB Hairrington's for about a year.
I always go to Nikki-I think she is amazing.
The salon is a decent size and has lots of stylists.
They offer you water or soda while you are getting all beautified.
Everyone seems to be friendly and the salon looks very clean.
Like I said I use Nikki and I wouldn't consider going to anyone else.
If she is out of town, I will wait.
She has really reasonable prices and I feel great everytime I leave.
There are plenty of places closer to my house (I live about 20 minutes away) but it's worth the drive for me.
Check out this place and definately ask for Nikki.
I get a cut with dark color and foil partial or all over foil.
Worth every penny, and a lot cheaper than the last 4 places I've been.
They also have a gal that does nails, but I think only one.
I haven't used her, but I know she is available.
They offer some waxing servies also.

I have been going to BB Harington's for a few years now, mostly for my nails.
Kim Ball is amazing and does great work!
I will NEVER go to an Asian nail salon ever again!
Nadia does my hair and is Amazing as well!
I refer both Kim and Nadia every chance i get!

Am from upstate New York attending a graduation and found myself needing emergency hair assistance.
Ashleigh came to the rescue providing thoughtful, creative, suggestions which resulted in amazing hair color and style!
i felt comfortable enough to actually try a new color and style despite the absence of my regular beautician.
Cannot say enough great things about Ashleigh!
If you are looking for someone who listens, and is truly concerned about getting it "right" for you, search no further!

Love this place!
Arley has done my hair twice now.
She does a fantastic job!
She takes her time and you can tell she really cares about her customers.
I will definitely keep coming back.
Prices are great and the salon offers you water or soda too.

I've been coming to this salon for over a year now.
Ashleigh always does my hair and she's fantastic.
All of the other ladies in the salon are always so friendly as well.
I'd never go any where else.
I'm not sure why there was a one star review, because I've never experienced them not being accommodating- and can't imagine why they would ever be.
Perhaps the caller called a bit too late in the day?
Any way, best salon ever.
