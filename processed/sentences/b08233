Good roast beef.
The place can get crowded, but service is pretty fast when they're not.

A really a clean (maybe new?
) Arby's.

Excellent roast beef, the Big max is the best.
I asked for extra horsey sauce didn't get but 3.
Then I realized the roast beef is delicious doesn't need none of of that.
Fast drive thru even during high traffic times at noon
