I love corn dogs!
Pay no attention to the mesmerizing colors of the their uniforms and to that really funny hat.
You could say that I am indeed a Hot Dog on a Stick fan.
For some reason they have the best corn dogs I have ever tasted and the dogs are always cooked to perfection.
The fresh lemonade here is excellent.
Try the cheese on a stick, I know it sounds disturbingly unhealthy and gross but in a non cardiologist point of view, I find myself actually liking this deep fried concoction.
The french fries here at the Boulevard mall is the best out of all the locations in Las Vegas.
If you like corn dogs and lemonade, this place is for you.

One of my all-time favorite places to eat in the mall.
From the teenage girls in quirkly yellow,red & blue striped uniforms to the fresh lemonade(cherry,apple or lemonade) to the corn or cheese dogs.
I just love it.
Good stuff....  PLUS its Cheap Fast & always good.
NEW  they now offer FUNNEL CAKE STICKS with Chocloate syrup OR Raspberry Syrup  & powdered sugar !!
Sooooooooo  Yummy!

Not going to lie but I am a huge fan of this place.
They have a simple menu that consists of fried stuff and lemonade.
What more can you ask for in life?
My personal favorite, hands down, is the pepper jack cheese on a stick.
My only knock against this place and every other hot dog on a stick is that its pricey...
I mean for petes sake, $3 for a corn dog is a little much for me outside of the a baseball game or county fair.
Granted...
I will not let it slow me down.

Lemonade- goes perfect with this Vegas heat.
