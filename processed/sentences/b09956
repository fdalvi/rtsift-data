The staff is usually old women that have a chip on their shoulders and have an attitude like they do not want to be there.
They would like to be home, or smoking a fag or just bitch to each other while people are waiting to get their gas paid for.
Poor management, which usually reflects on poor ownership, but it is usually the cheapest gas, if you are headed top the lake, so.....

dirty, don't touch anything!

Worst gas stop in 2000 miles.
Filthy building, locked bathrooms out back, surly distracted staff, stupid placement of air pump in the far corner of the parking lot.
Avoid.

Cheapest gas in Boulder City.
Doesn't mean it's cheap!

Pros: big parking lot, lots of space around the gas pumps.
If you have a boat or trailer you'll appreciate the space.
Gas prices seem to be reasonable.
C-store is well stocked, pricing for ice and soft drinks is about the same as any other c-store in Vegas.
Cons: On weekends it can be a mad house.
The staff can be surly and painfully slow.
Gotta use the restroom?
You might want to practice your holding technique until you can stop anywhere else.
And did I mention weekend traffic sucks, especially when you're trying to get back on the highway?
Summary: During the week it's worth the time to stop.
On busy weekends ugh....keep crawling along in traffic.

No need to read any other review.
This place is a gas station.
You don't come here for an experience.
You stop here to get gas and take a leak while driving in/out of Las Vegas.
Multiple pumps and easy accessibility back onto 93 N and S. Boom.
