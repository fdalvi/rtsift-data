Whenever I'm not in Los Angeles, the Bay Area, or Manhattan, I am continually amazed at what can be done when space is not at a premium.
Shopping at this roomy Safeway, which has its own gas station, is nice.
It is appropriately air conditioned for its location and there are carts stored indoors if the ones outside are too warm (particularly a consideration if you are going to put a child in the cart).
Otherwise, this is a normal Safeway.
Alternatives include a nearby Albertson's and Sprouts Farmers Market.

As far as grocery store's goes... this one was pretty good.
Every store varies from layout to layout even within the same chain; but I had no problem finding everything i needed for a 4 item brunch for 20 people.
There a whole flower and balloon area with a pretty decent collection of things to satisfy most customers unless you are looking for something very specific.
One thing I will say is that the person that was helping the people infront of me with the balloons was having trouble with the register so she brought them to a different counter; BUT send over the guy working the starbucks counter (oh yeah they have one) over and he helped me out.
So I thought that was pretty nice of them.

This is the closest grocery store to my house, so it's the one I'm at the most.
The cashiers are always super friendly and at least attempt to call me by my name when I check out which is different, but nice.
Very clean store.
It's best to go later in the evening because, well...it's Sun City!

Great for a quick stop for a forgotten item on vacation.
However, we went grocery shopping here and were disappointed by the limited fresh produce options.
Their limes were bruised and discolored from being old and their prices were not worth the quality.
We ended up going to Sprouts down the street and were much happier.
