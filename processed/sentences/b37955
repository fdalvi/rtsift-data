I stopped in to train while on vacation.
Great class and rolling.
I will come back the next time I pass through Arizona.

Best gym in town.
Great people, great professors!

Just started training here a few weeks ago.. Everyone is very helpful and instructor very thorough.
Lots of room to roll around in this gym.
Happy to be a student here and definitely recommend this place to the experienced/unexperienced  or those looking for something new to get into..
