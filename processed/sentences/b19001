This station consistently has the cheapest gas in North Las Vegas.
A nice convenience store to go along with great gas prices.
Located just up the street from Viva Zapata's Mexican........
The place to stop on your way to Nellis.

The gas is cheap.
Plenty of gas pumps.
And this AMPM has a Orange Whip drink which many others do not to my dismay.
Plus when you drive thru sewer water and your truck has this ungodly smell to it of umm well you can figure it out.
The carwash is a blessing at 4.99 with its spot free rinse and decent blowers to get it completely dry.

My brother pulled in here for fuel on our way to Valley of Fire State Park.
Arco, which is owned by BP, is one of the least expensive name brand fuel retailers in metropolitan Las Vegas.
Regardless, there was no effort finding an available fuel pump.

Cheap gas, great car wash, and clean restrooms; what more could you ask for?!
I fill up here every saturday and get a carwash as well.
Its literally 10 cents cheaper than the gas station across the street!
These guys do a really good job inside the store as well, its always clean and they have by far the cleanest restrooms I've seen in a gas station.

I always love am pm :) came in here for a drink on my way home, and some gas before it doubles, yet again!
Clean,quick and lots of drink options!

This gas station is trashy.
The car wash staff member is extremely rude and has no manners.
You pay 7.99 for a car wash and free vacuuming, but there is only one "working" hose and it doesn't even vacuum anything!
And the car wash itself didn't really clean anything.
Waste of time and money.
Go somewhere else.
