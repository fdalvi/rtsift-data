Wow Someone reviewed Penazzi?
Hehehe ok so I just had the Crab Cake here...Mind you it was to go?
But it was Yum.
Been here before...had Oyster shooters or two....The staff was nice.
Even to a guy like me.
Mind you I can be a jerk.
Definitely cool people.
I liked to watch this one tall girl shuck.
Yea she was definitely a good shucker.
I've never seen anyone shuck so fast.
I wish I can shuck that accurately.
I try to shuck with skill.
But back to the food.
Great seafood.
Scampi good.
Calamari - YUM.
So Harrah's is finally comin up some more.
So if you don't know where Penazzi's is - GO INSIDE HARRAH'S ask directions, then later you can go to Carnival Court and Get drunk.

Ok, here's the deal.
I feel like an ass because I haven't written a review since my last trip anywhere (which was SF).
I realized, quite sadly, that I haven't visited anywhere new in a while that made me think of reviewing.
It seems to be a trip thing now--which clearly blows, since I live to review!!
Anywho, I went on another family escapade to Sin City during Spring Break.
We stayed at Harrah's again cause it was free.
Last time we ate there, I was somewhat disappointed.
This time, the experience was notably better.
We had dinner at their Italian restaurant that I didn't know existed until my mom suggested we have dinner there.
Here's the thing: we had arrived earlier that day, and my sister and I spent some time walking around the Strip until dinnertime.
We get to the restaurant and all I can say is that I was underdressed from here to yesteryear.
Woops!!!
Someone say something man!!
A change of clothes was only an elevator ride away.
But, as my cousin was quick to point out, not too big a deal--it's Vegas; you get brides and bums dining in the same restaurant at the same time.
(I was the bum!!
)  I had a great Caesar salad to start.
Yes I sample Caesar salads a lot, cause it's one of those things--like the onion soup, or the fish tacos.
The bread basket was damn good, too.
A nice olive oil/vinegar brought to the table; shaken, not stirred.
The Pinot Grigio was darn good--really bold and flavorful.
I had scallops for dinner.
Oh were they good?!!!?!!
Umm, yes.
The potatoes were tasty, too.
I sampled my sister's pasta with vodka sauce and prosciutto and shrimp.
I really liked it.
You're supposed to taste the pasta in these dished people.
The pasta isn't supposed to be drowning in some thick sauce.
Dessert was ridiculous!!
We were stuffed full, but decided to order the dessert on the menu meant for two people.
So here comes this GIANT mound of cream.
(Apparently the dessert's name was "white mountain" in Italian---I have no cultural tact, clearly.
)  Then, the waiter brings up this cart with a grill, lights the sucker and pours some lovely Amaretto into a pan.
Next thing you know, that liquid's on fire and is being poured (still with flames about) onto the white mound.
AHHHHH, white mountain on freakin' liquor fire!!!!
Yes, we attracted attention with our choice of dessert.
The bachelorette party at the next table took pictures...He cut into it, and it was dark chocolate and white chocolate gelato inside.
It was REALLY good!!!
BTW, it said for two...two what?
Hippos?!!?
The thing was HYUGE!!
No really, I'm a fatass, but really...  A final note on the ambience---a tad cheese, but who cares!?
It's Vegas.
Open kitchen with lots of flames and sounds and smells.
A traveling guitarist playing all the kitschy Italian hits---sing it if you know it!!!
(And my dad did know quite a few of them.
My lushed-up mother kept telling him that he sings much better than the guitarist and that he should take over...'nuff about that.
)  The owner travelled from table to table chatting up the clientele.
All around a darn good time.

My Dad insisted on this place for dinner this last family trip to Vegas on Friday.
The restaurant side was actually closed with only the oyster bar open but one of the servers actually catered to our big party and seated us at one of the restaurant sections.
How accomodating.
I must say, this place had the freshest oysters I've had.
It was sooooo good.
We also had the crab and shrimp and seafood cocktail for our appetizers along with cups of their New England clam chowder.
We were in seafood heaven!
The entire party enjoyed all their entrees which consisted of grilled halibut, seafood jambalaya, blackened scallop fettucine, langostine salad w/ house dressing to name a few.
Our server was absolutely fabulous and had a great sense of humor.
Great turn-out for my parents' 30th anniversary dinner.
I would definitely come back here on our next trip.

This place was real good.
The oysters are so fresh, as good as bar crudo in SF.
Got the Oysters and the blackened scallop pasta and the new england clam chowder.
Everything was so good, besides the pasta in the scallop plate.
but the scallops were delicious.
Just get the oysters!!
One of my best meals in vegas.
Will definately come back again.
for 4 people the bill came out to about $100.
Not bad at all.

We took the GF's dad (and his Diamond Player's card) to this place for some quick grub since the bar at Harrah's Rincon was delicious.
It's probably the best thing I did that weekend.
They have a good selection of oysters, soup, and pastas.
Personally, I didn't care much for anything but the oysters, so I vaguely remember what I ate.
It pretty much left me speechless.
My recommendation?....check it out for yourself.
Thank me later.

I randomly ate here maybe a year or two ago w/ friends bc we were staying across the way, and my friend had a bunch of credits for free food.
My friend got some red wine sauce linguini w/ jumbo shrimp and it was freaking delicious.
I've been craving it ever since, so this time around, we came back and both ordered the same dish.
Of course, it wasn't as good as I remembered (mainly bc the four jumbo shrimp it came with was overcooked and the pasta was slightly cold), but it was still good.
We also ordered the Manhattan Clam Chowder, which was really yummy and perfect for a hangover.
Though my friend didn't get the clams again, she said they were really good the last time.
Bread wasn't that great, but we were hardly able to put a dent in our food bc the portions were pretty large so it didn't matter anyways.

We ate at Penazzi for a couple of our friends' birthdays while we were staying at Harrah's.
We got dressed up for the occasion, though like most places in Vegas it wasn't necessary (except for the clubs).
We were given a the small room in the back with a large round table, which worked great for us.
We were served promptly, though it took quite a while for the food to come out.
At least in the meantime the bread we got with the balsamic dip was addicting.
I thoroughly enjoyed what I ordered, the special (a seafood risotto), though some of my friends felt they overpaid for what they got.
We also had some great entertainment from one of the hosts, who shared some Italian wisdom with us and some wine recommendations.
At the end of the meal, a couple of chocolate banana desserts were brought out for the celebrants, which we all ate up.
I can't speak for how it would be for a romantic dinner for two, but Penazzi sure is great for a big group.

This place is AWESOME!
My boyfriend and I just randomly decided to go here instead of wherever else we were going to go and I was not disappointed.
I got a half dozen Oysters Royale which are oysters with kind of creme and some caviar on top.
My boyfriend got the salmon.
And we both got oyster shooters.
First, the Oysters Royale was excellent.
I love oysters already and these were the best I've ever had.
My boyfriend hasn't had good experiences with oysters but even he thought these were excellent.
I wish I had gotten a dozen, but the half-dozen was already 20 bucks.
Oh well, money well-spent in my opinion.
My boyfriend's salmon was also very very good.
Cooked perfectly and just yummy!
I got the bloody mary oyster shooter and my boyfriend got some kind of tequila lime one.
All of the shooters are very spicy!
Mine was particularly so, but I loved it!
I definitely recommend getting one.
Why not, yeah?
So after I ate the oysters, I was watching my boyfriend eat and I decided that I wanted more.
So I order some kind of seafood soup in hearty tomato soup.
Let me say that it was AMAZING!
I LOVE tomatoes, so this soup was heaven!
There were scallops, shrimp, clams, mussels, and even half of a lobster tail in the soup!
MMMMMM!
The bill ended up being around 70 bucks for the two of us, but it was well worth it in my opinion!
We spent around the same amount at the Wynn Buffet the next day and that was a huge letdown.
I wish I had just come back to the Oyster Bar instead!

We found the Oyster Bar through Yelp and it certainly lived up to the positive reviews.
We liked it so much, in fact, that we had dinner here twice over our Vegas weekend trip.
Where do I start?
The oysters on the rocks are incredibly fresh and at only $20 a dozen, it doesn't get much better than that.
The crab cakes are absolutely delicious and the calamari was crisp on the outside and tender to the bite.
The bouillabaisse is loaded with fresh lobster, scallops, jumbo prawns, mussels, and clams and is simmered in a rich, saffron-infused broth.
The jambalaya pasta had a creamy, smoky, flavorful sauce and was generously tossed with chicken, sausage, and jumbo prawns.
The grilled king crab legs were phenomenal.
They were served hot and coated in a buttery glaze of seasonings and spices and served with drawn butter and lemon wedges.
The wait staff is great too.
Our waitresses on both occasions were friendly, accommodating, and attentive.
I've been visiting Las Vegas twice a year for the past 8 years already and I've paid anywhere from 2 figures to 4 figures for meals depending on where I wish to dine.
I'd have to say that the Oyster Bar has been one of the better dining experiences I've had without costing me an arm and a leg.
It makes me wonder if some of those haute cuisine venues are simply full of overpriced pretension.
*note* Although the Oyster Bar is adjacent to Penazzi, they're actually 2 different restaurants.
The Oyster Bar does not take reservations, it's first come first serve and you seat yourself.
(which isn't as bad as it sounds, it was never overcrowded and we never had to wrestle for seating)  The Oyster Bar and Penazzi also have independent menus, so don't make the mistake of making a reservation at Penazzi thinking you can order items from the Oyster Bar.
Some of the other reviews are confusing in that aspect and I wanted to clarify because my family and I nearly commited that blunder.

Talk about a diamond in the rough!!
We read the reviews of the oyster bar but went to the restaurant instead.
We were not disappointed.
The calamari was tender and lightly breaded quite a large portion too (3 to 4 people).
We had a fish and pasta dish both was excellent.
The frutti de mare was a little bit spicy but good with a large amount of seafood.
The fish was scallops dusted with pistachios and sitting on top of creamed leeks.
We didn't have dessert but they looked good as they past the table.
The servers were very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable.
The wine by the glass was very limited.
But all and all a great place to eat.

After totally stumbling into this restaurant, we were absolutely surprised that it was one of the best meals we have ever had on the strip!!!
The artichoke in lemon garlic sauce appetizer was to die for!
The Cesar salad was perfect and the veal piccata and halibut dishes were pure perfection.
The wait staff were very attentive and friendly without being overly pushy.
I would recommend this place to anyone.
Definitely going back again!
This place could count as a hole in the wall kinda place done Vegas style.

We entrusted the help of our fellow yelpers for a good place to eat before going to our show.
We turned our sights on the Oyster Bar and unfortunately, it did not live up to the expectation we had set for it.
Luckily for us, we were looking for something light, but we didn't expect having something light would compromise for taste.
We ordered two dozen oysters, one served on the half shell ($20) and the Royale ($29) which had caviar and some creme on it.
They both came out considerably small (take note of the photos) and the sad part was if you closed your eyes, you would not be able to tell the difference between the two.
Til this day, I still don't know what the fuss is over caviar.
Anyhow, the oysters were not only small, but lacked in flavor.
I was clearly disappointed because I knew I could get about twice as many oysters at my local crawfish house.
Sadness.
At least the crab cakes did not disappoint.
They were light, crisp, and slightly oily but not bad at all.
The sauce accompanied with it was great, but even with that being said, I can't overlook the fact that this oyster bar didn't have good oysters!
It isn't the best place to hang out at either.
Your view is basically the casino floor and a small bar area with a display of ice and oysters on them.
Too bad we looked forward to something all weekend that ended up being a huge let down =(

Fellow Yelpers, you have hit the nail on the head with this one.
I'm originally from the East Coast and I do have opinions about seafood.
Stuck-up, know-it-all opinions... and I was blown away by this restaurant.
I went to this restaurant strictly based on the reviews I read here and I had an incredible experience!
We ordered a garden salad, half-dozen oysters on the half-shell, crab cakes, and the bouillabaisse.
The salad was your standard restaurant starter.
Fresh vegetables and nothing fancy.
But that's not what I came for.
The oysters - the OYSTERS!!
YES!!
- were so, so good.
I was sorry we had only ordered a half dozen!
They were cold, fresh, shucked in front of us, and eaten in about two minutes.
The "Maryland-Style" crab cakes were very meaty, with very little, if no bread at all.
The seasoning was very light and I was impressed, and I am very, VERY opinionated when anyone claims "Maryland" when describing their crab dishes.
The bouillabaisse had LARGE shrimp and HUGE scallops as well as mussels, clams, lobster and fish.
The broth was a little too rich for my taste but I can appreciate how enjoyable the dish is.
I noticed that the people seated next to us had ordered the jambalaya and a fried shrimp appetizer.
Both of those dishes had the very large shrimp.
On the other side of us, I overheard a man telling his server that he comes to this restaurant every time he visits Las Vegas, and was bringing his companion for the first time, who remarked about how much they enjoyed the food.
Our server was excellent.
He was very friendly, offered helpful suggestions and even hinted to us that while there was a charge for an official split-plate request, there was no charge for him to bring me an extra plate... (if I wanted to split the food myself).
A great meal and I will definetly be back!

My friends and I had stayed at Harrah's for Memorial Day weekend and kept seeing posters of this oyster bar.
One of the girls and I are crazy about oysters so we decided to check this place out.
The host/waiter (I didn't get his name) was extremely nice.
He was very friendly, helpful, and provided great service.
My friend and I ordered a half dozen of the Oysters Royale (raw) and half dozen of the Oyster Rockefeller (baked).
Both dishes were really good although I liked the Oysters Royale more because of both the caviar and oysters freshness.
Although it is a bit pricey ($30 for both dishes), it was well worth it.

"Oyster- gasmic!
"  [First impression] Harrah has an oyster bar?
Indeed they do.
And a pretty darn good one at that.
We needed a light "snack" while strolling the Strip and decided to go for some oysters.
When in the middle of the desert right?
Why not!
I was sold when I found out they had my favorite-- Fanny Bay.
We decided to get a dozen mixed which is usually a great way to try a little bit of everything.
[Suggestion] *Avoid the temptation to get a dozen mixed oysters and go straight for the Fanny Bay.
They are by far my favorite-- small to medium size, creamy and meaty.
[Tips] *Sit at the bar.

Woo hoo~ Deals are still to be had in Las Vegas.
A dozen freshly shucked oysters for $20!
We made the mistake of ordering other things like the oyster shooter and Rockefeller oysters neither of which was a bargain or exceptionally delicious.
We should have just gotten two dozens.
No, wait, make that 3 dozens!
I regret that I spent $200 at Bouchon.
I could have had at least 3 meals at the Oyster Bar with that money.
I ordered a glass of Prosecco, and the pour was extremely generous.
Almost filled up to the top.
Yeah!
My husband got a strawberry margarita, which was delicious and stronger and cheaper than the one we had at the Mirage.
It's a must-try on the strip in my book.

five stars for the oysters!
this is as delicious and fresh as it gets!
especially in the summer when vegas is at its hottest.
i cant get enough of their cocktail sauce either.
ladies beware though, theres a waiter that stares at boobies.. and he does not do it discretely.
but other than that, everything was just fab.
ive had a pasta dish there before and it was really good.. the bread and butter is yummy.. and the waiters (minus the boob-staring pervert) are funny and likeable  oh yeah this place is in Harrah's

After reading the reviews here I had in mind what I wanted to order when I got to the Oyster Bar only to find they changed there menu just 3 days before.
The new menu is up now on line but it wasn't when I was there this weekend.
Seems like the menu has fewer choices.
The food was excellent and fresh.
We had a nice bottle of wine with our food.
The Manhattan clam chowder was spicer than I have had before but thats what I liked about it.
Now I am craving it.
We even went back the next day to try the pasta dishes.
Everything was great and we even enjoyed the people at the bar and the cook.
I didn't see the pervert (might be cause I am a old grandma).

The food is really what earned this 5 stars.
One chef who took our order was subtly rude.
The other one checked up on us well and made very pleasant conversation.
This place was easy to find in Harrah's, and we got very quick service at about 8pm on a Sunday night.
We had the Oysters Rockefeller style (baked with cheese, breadcrumbs, etc.
) and they were FANTASTIC.
The seafood risotto was also very well cooked and we got quite a bit more lobster in it than expected for $24.
We will definitely be making a stop in here next year when we go back to Vegas!

A dozen oysters for $20 FTW!
This review is strictly for oysters only.
First of all, I love oysters.
Hell, I love them so much that I made my bf walk 1 mile down the strip in 103 degree weather JUST so I could eat them.
Did I mention that this was right after we finished having lunch too?
Yeah, he definitely hated me that day.
At $20 for a dozen or $12 for half dozen, I think this place is a great deal.
The oysters are fresh, the servers give you all the condiments to go with it (lemon, horse radish, cocktail sauce, etc) and my entire time there turned into a oyster binge-eating contest all by myself (boyfriend was too full from lunch to join me) Hell, it was so good that the server convinced me to buy another dozen.
I still can't believe I spent $40 just eating oysters but oh well.
I wanna say this is this is the best because frankly, I don't know where else they would sell oysters for such a good deal.
The half-dozen price is pretty common but the $20 dozen price is what made me love this place.
I'm not a fan of Harrah's but this oyster bar makes me love Harrah's just a little bit more.

Excellent place for lunch!
We got a couple seats at the bar and we were quickly served.
We ordered a dozen oysters and got another dozen of our favorite of the two they had (Fannie Bay, I think - nice and briny).
The waiter paired the oysters with some excellent wine.
Finally we got another 1/2 dozen of the other (more mild) and finished everything off with the wonderful bread pudding.
All of this for $80!
It was awesome to sit right next to where the chef was shucking the oysters.
Also the horseradish that they served with the oysters is super freshly grated!
It was awesome!
Just watch out how much you put on because it can get really spicy.
This was one of my most favorite meals while I was in Vegas.
And I will be going back to this place again!

Service was excellent from the moment we sat ourselves to the moment we left.
Our server, Heidi, was pleasant and knowledgeable on both the menu and drinks.
She rattled off the entire beer menu to us without missing a beat..very impressive Ms. Heidi and kudos.
We ordered the clam chowder and fried calamari.
The calamari was an appetizer size, but wow this can feed four easily..it was served in a huge bowl and came nicely fried and very tender.
Came with an even mix of tentacles and rings.
Served with lemon, aioli and marinara sauce..delicious!
The clam chowder was very good as well.
Hubby and I came in just for a small bite to tide us over til dinner - wow..this ended up being our dinner!
I will be sure to visit this place every time I go to Vegas.
It's located right by the Harrah's buffet and Penazzi's main restaurant.

I went simply to get a dozen oysters and that's what I got.
They were great, shucked freshly behind the bar, good horseradish.
The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I was behind a pole from where the wait staff hung out and was neglected (out of sight, out of mind).
But $20 for a great dozen of oysters is worth a bit of a wait for a beverage refill.

Great atmosphere.
Food very good.
Wait service not the caliber of Circo, but very good nonetheless!
Food was rushed out even though restaurant was relatively empty.
This is the loss of a star.
I like my meals spaced out more!
Calamari was excellent.
Not over cooked.
Not rubbery.
Our dinners were excellent as well.
My wife's Shrimp scampi was perfectly cooked.
The shrimp were huge, the portions large, and the garlic heavy!
My sausage and chicken was very good as well.
Great flavors and great portion!
Definitely a must, even a return visit!
Forget Circo at Bellaggio, go here and be happy for considerably less!

So supposedly this is the best place for oysters.
A few of us met up here for lunch.
The oysters were pretty good, but it's not like I could fill up on it so we ordered a bunch of other appetizers.
The tuna roll was not very good, but the crabcakes dipped in the sauce were good, and the deep fried oysters were pretty good.
It's also in Harrah's which you can easily miss if you do not know how to get here.
We ordered key lime pie for dessert that tasted like cheesecake with a hint of lime.
Not bad for key lime pie for the first time.

I highly recommend this place for oyster.
The sushi sucked though.
And they key lime pie taste just like cheesecake.

This place is not crowded which I love and their oysters are ooo so yum.
The waiter said they had two types of oysters and for some reason "Asian people" like the "Fanny Bay Oysters" compared to the "Blue Point Oysters.
"  I then proceed to ask him why he said "Fanny Bay has a fishier taste to it.
"  I ordered the "Fanny Bay Oysters" and I'm glad I did.
Things you should expect:  Don't expect a 5 star oyster bar.
It's a laid back oyster bar and the only thing we recommend are the following:  -Clam Chowder : Rich and creamy filled with clams.
-Steamed Little Neck Clams: The broth is buttery and has herbs -Oysters:  You're not going to get full off of them so order a dozen per person.
-Calamari:  Make sure to ask them to do it WELL DONE or EXTRA Crispy.
They are the best when they are extra done.
If you don't tell them that they'll come out a little soft.
If you want a quick fix JUST for oyster and a snack come here to eat or grab a bite.
Don't come here looking for a 5 star feast.

I got a hookup here from the casino and so eating it for 50% off tasted a lot better.
My friend got the oyster dozen and I tried one, it was good (on ice), but tasted of nothing special.
I couldn't necessarily discern the freshness or flavor from any other good oyster.
I'm guessing it was average/good to everyone else, but not standout for an "oyster bar.
" The New England clam chowder (the red version) was actually really good, had a ton of seafood and clams in it (though I tasted some small shell bits which wasn't nice), but it was really tasty, I recommend it.
I got the fish of the day which was mahi-mahi, one of my top 4 fish behind sea bass, salmon, and swordfish, it was solid - grilled with lime and lemon pepper (nothing I couldn't have made on my own).
I'd say as averagely tasty as it gets.
I wouldn't really recommend this place for Vegas.
It's not bad at all, also the service is very average to poor.
For the price and location and ambiance you can go to a million better seafood spots.

Bf and I ate there two nights in a row.
The raw oysters were nice and reasonably priced: $20/dozen.
They are open till 2am on fri and sat night, and serve the oysters that late, yesss!
The second night we tried the seafood risotto - heaven!
The wine selection was kinda weak, but I still found what I wanted.
We'll be back for more!

Great little place.
Fast service and the food wasn't that bad or bland.
Half of the group ordered the $15 special (smaller portions, but there was a salad).
There was free bread, and lots of it which helped some of us fill up due to the smaller portions, although some were still left hungry.
Service was fast.
Table for 10 was ready in a minute.

I woke up from a nap and immediately turned to Mr. Hottie and demanded oysters.
He raised a brow and I knew he was thinking "Great.
What's this going to cost me??
" So I hopped on Yelp to find reasonably priced oysters.
I found Oyster Bar and read Su K's review regarding the place being a good deal and I was sold!
We hit the door dressed up for a fab night out.
We arrived at Oyster Bar around 10pm.
I ordered a glass of prosecco and we ordered a dozen oysters.
Oyster Bar carries 3 kinds of oysters on any given night, so we mixed the variety up.
Actually, I let Mr. Hottie mix things up and I sat back and sipped my beverage!
The oyster quality was great!
Some of the oysters were fresh and briny, others were soft and buttery.
The freshness of each oyster was without question!
We also ordered the mussels.
Now I'm not a huge fan of mussels and these didn't win me over.
They were a tad overcooked in my opinion; still the broth was full of flavor.
We sat at the actual bar of the restaurant and our waiter was attentive and talkative.
He was also preparing the food behind the bar!
He kept checking on our food and making sure we had everything we needed.
Oyster Bar is one of the best bargains I have seen in a while in Vegas.
A dozen oysters were 20 bones with all condiments included.
Was this a fancy seafood restaurant?
No.
It's a casual place to stop in, have a drink and have some fresh oysters before heading out for the evening!
I will definitely be back to visit!

I was a little hesitant eating oysters hung over.
I have a super sensitive stomach and raw oysters are not a number one choice at any time hung over.
BUT i love oysters especially fresh raw delicious oysters.
We order a dozen raw oysters with crab cakes.
The oysters are fresh and the crab cakes were delicious!
For only $30 for two people I would definitely suggest Oyster Bar for a quick seafood fix!

Thumbs up to the dozen oysters, which were FRESH!
And the yummy crab cakes that me and my gf devoured!
Everyone working here were so friendly and helpful.
I swear when we sat down we had 2 different cooks and servers asked if we've been helped.

I had to give this place 5 stars because it's such a great value for Vegas.
After a brief search on Yelp for an inexpensive seafood spot, Penazzi's was the overwhelming winner.
So once we got to Vegas and checked into our hotel, we headed down to Harrah's and plopped ourselves at the bar here.
The only time I've had raw oysters before was a couple shooters at the Acme Oyster House in New Orleans a long time ago, and even that had tabasco sauce and alcohol or something in it...so basically I had never had raw oysters because they skeeved me out a little bit.
I like mussels ok but I've always found clams to be too sea-water-tasting, and that's what I expected oysters to taste like too.
Well not these!!
We ordered a half dozen raw and a half dozen fried oysters and they were as fresh as could be, and not ocean-y at all!!
In fact, I liked the raw oysters BETTER than the fried ones, because they were just so darn refreshing.
The fried oysters were serious though, because they were WHOLE--not the pieces you sometimes get at seafood restaurants.
When you bite into them, oyster juices go everywhere.
We were pretty hungry so we also ordered a bowl of lobster bisque and the linguini fra diavolo with mussels.
The bisque was pretty gross in my opinion, but they sure weren't skimpy with the mussels!!!
It was good, but pretty spicy.
The raw oysters were the clear winner of the evening.
This place isn't cheap by any other city's standards but it really is a pretty good deal in Vegas--I highly recommend you check it out!

FRESH and CHEAP!
Another point for Yelp!!
We came here for dinner after a short walk on the strip.
There was a sign that said "Seat Yourself" so we sat at the bar.
We ordered the Neptune's Martini and a half dozen Rockefellers -- very impressive.
My wife doesn't normally eat raw oysters but she tried these, and said they were pretty good!
Some dude next to us ordered Rockefellers with chopped shrimp, spinach, crab meat and bacon!
We didn't know they customize orders, so we'll have to come back and try that one!
Dinner comes with free bread.
I, personally, would ask for just the flat bread.
It's so fresh and crispy!
I wanted more raw oysters so I ordered another half dozen.
Use caution when sampling the horseradish!
As Russell Peters would say... "It's mind BLASTING!
"  We also ordered some Jambalaya w/ Chicken.
This was very tasty!
Their Andouille and Tasso was out of this world!
At this point we had to undo our belts a few notches, and we were ready to leave... but then, there they were... Crab Cakes!
This other couple also sitting at the bar ordered them, and we had to have them!
These were pure crab (no bread), perfectly spiced!
They were a little on the moist side, but otherwise very good!
The Remoulade was the perfect compliment!
TIP:  Try it with the flat bread!
With that, we called it a dinner and left... a few pounds heavier!
Definitely recommended!

Wonderful restaurant inside Harrah's hotel casino.
Came here to have diner and service was outstanding.
Oysters, and the rest of the meal was delicious, tasty, and doen right.
The waitress Angie was very attentive, and made our evening pleasant.
Definitively recommended.
Will go back.

A great little Vegas gem.
I had heard some good things about this place, and the reviews were right.
Wife and I shared a dozen and a half oysters with a couple of chilled Grey Goose shots followed by their Jumbo Shrimp cocktail, and ended with the seafood risotto and a few glasses of bubbly.
The oysters were really fresh, the shrimp were jumbo although I thought 6 shrimp would have been better than the 4 they gave, and the risotto offered some much needed warmth from the 50 degree weather outside.
I'll be back next time we're here...could turn into a tradition.
A walk down the strip, some oysters, vodka and bubbly only in Vegas.

Amazing.
We ordered a dozen fresh raw oysters, a dozen Rockerfellers, and a dozen of the deep-fried ones.
In the future I'd probably get all raw ones!
They were SO good and delicious.
The fried ones were more batter and flour than oyster, so I would stay away from those if given a choice between the three.
There's not much to be said of the ambiance.
It's too bad, because the oysters are SO GOOD.
This place would probably be busier if it weren't a Monday night at 4:30pm.
And if it weren't at Harrah's.

ahhhhh brah.
perspektive.
when i read the reviews on yelp i wuz ready to trip.. even brought my moms-- an old skool shucker from the dirty south gulf coast.
service wuz great.. but... oysters.. nahhhh bruh.
they were TINY.. looked all cute on my plate.. but for $20 ?!?..
this may be a bargain to you kind folks on the left coast, but i've had much much better, bigger, saltier, fresher oysters at the likes of acme oyster house and felix's in n'awlins.. & paid less than $9/dozen.
listen, you gots to go to know.
the tuna roll-- 1 out of  5 stars, the lobster bisque-- tasted like it came from a can of campbell's soup.
this dude wuz disappointed.
and mom confirmed-- she wuz like, "yo, son.. you gots to do betta than dis".
sorry, mom.
next stop in vegas, chinatown.
stay tuned.

I guess the only reason I am not giving them a 5 star is simply because I usually set the bar really high, so a 4 star from me means definitely worth a try!
We ordered a dozen oyster(half fresh and half fried), they tasted so good and fresh(my stomach didn't complain what's so ever).
They gave us three types of sauces for fresh oyster-- cocktail, horseradish, and ranch.
( they also provide tobasco)  I ordered sauteed clam pasta with white sauce.
Not only it tasted good, they gave me lots of clams--Seriously-- I think I probably got 25+ or so  clams, and they gave me another big bowl for shells.
My friend ordered seafood risotto which was filled with clams, mussel jumbo shrimp and even real lobster!
They don't use strong wines like many Italian places in Cali do, instead it has stronger flavor of tomato sauce.
As of price, I think it is very subjective.
Some might feel it dirty cheap, some might feel the opposite.
My opinion is, given the quality and the service( the guy who gave us service that night was extremely friendly and helpful), it is definitely not pricy.
Most of their dishes are priced like many mid-level Italian restaurants in Cali, but they have a better quality!

BEFORE YOU HATE ON MY RATING, I just have to say that my review is NOT for the oysters.
I don't eat oysters, not because I don't like them, but because I'm afraid to like them..too much.
Haha.
So I'm sure this is the place to go if you want oysters but my review is solely for their crab cake, sauteed clams in white sauce, and their customer service.
First the crab cakes: very good price.
I read the menu and knew right away that that was what I was going to order.
$16 for crab cakes is about right..but wait until see the size of those babies!
They give you two huge gallops of crab cake, with real crab meat and a slight crunch on the outer layer.
The salad it sat on was amazing and the sauce it came with was even better.
I'd come back for their crab cakes anytime!
Now their pasta:  I was preferring the Shrimp Scampi but since my friends were already ordering the sauteed clams in white sauce, I thought..wth, I'll give that a try.
If it weren't for this dish, I may have given Oyster Bar 4 stars.
But because of this dish, I've decided to subtract a star.
ALMOST TWO!
This dish was...unacceptable for a restaurant of their status.
Yea, they give you a lot of clams...more like a lot of shells with no clams inside!
I thought, maybe they all fell out.
No.
I know the difference between clams and pasta.
It was really bland, too.
I couldn't even finish my portion.
The three of us left a pretty large amount of pasta behind.
No doggy bag, thanks.
Finally, their service.
Although friendly, it was slow.
We had a party of 9 but was waiting for 2 more.
Our waiter told us to "holler" when we were ready but how do we HOLLER if he's nowhere to be seen?
Also, two elderly ladies walked in and were seated next to us about 15 minutes after we sat down.
How come they were served bread before us?
Doesn't make sense.
So all in all, 4 stars for crab cake, 1 for clam pasta, 2 for service.

the oysters here are bomb diggity!!
I dont even usually like oysters because i think it has that ocean taste but these oysters were delish!!!
and the prices are very reasonable!
I also ordered the shrimp scampi and that was good as well.
The shrimps were a good size and the sauce was very tasty.
I am excited to pay this place another visit when i come back to vegas

What a delight.
Had modest expectations, but the food was excellent.
I had linguine with clams, and the light, white wine sauce had a lemony accent.
My daughter kept stealing off my plate, though she really enjoyed her gnocchi, which were large and plump and clearly homemade.
The wait staff was very friendly and personable, but the service a little slow, so plan to relax.
We had 6PM reservations and had to get out by 7:10 to make it to a show, and we did make it.
Prices were reasonable and we enjoyed a yummy split of champagne that was perfect for the two of us.

We stumbled upon this restaurant as we were picking up our Improv tickets early in the day, the menu looked good, and since we had to come back to the hotel for the show later, we figured it was worth a try!
My family is a bunch of seafood lovers, and we got our fill of seafood at the Oyster Bar!
We started off with the Lobster Bisque (so rich, and HUGE chunks of lobster), steamed clams in white wine broth (AMAZING) and some fresh oysters (SO FRESH!).
We also tried the crab legs, seafood risotto (swimming with seafood) and the scallops.
We loved everything, and felt that we really found a hidden gem in Vegas because you don't normally think of Harrah's as a dining mecca!
The prices were very reasonable compared to some of the high end dining options in Vegas...so I will be back next time I am in town!

I'm sad to say that Harrahs changed up their restaurant management who then decided to completely revamp the menu here.
They still serve oysters of course, but they aren't as good :(  They got rid of the awesome cioppino and the bouillabaisse so there's no point in going back.
I can't believe I went back just to get the bouillabaisse and they didn't have it!

6 oyster shooters with Patron Silver was perfect.
The freshest oysters we've had so far in Las Vegas.
Nice and plump with very little of an ocean taste.
We sat at the bar and served by the most friendliest guy.
It was a great atmostphere.
We will consider coming back in the future.
Usually we just go to Asian Buffet for all you can eat oysters but really it's a huge difference in quality.

Awesome place!
We were looking for a nice oyster bar that had a good selection of wine and fresh oysters and we found it!
Service was quick and knowledgeable and the atmosphere made an immediate impression.
Located at the back of the casino close to the parking garage, so it was easy to get to!

I was craving for raw oysters after looking at my old pictures at Boiling Crab.
There aren't many oyster bars on the strip (probably the only one on the strip) but luckily this one is legit.
Prices are reasonable: $20 for a dozen.
You can find cheaper joints with raw oysters like on Spring Mountain Road if you have a car.
Overall, my craving for raw oysters that night was satisfied!

I'm a good Catholic, so yesterday my friend and I went to the Oyster Bar.
We got there around 1pm, and it wasn't too busy and we sat right at the bar.
We got half a dozen raw oysters and the seafood platter.
I had their cosmo, it was a little weak (or not as strong as I was expecting).
The food came out pretty quickly, and the crab was just so-so and a little gritty.
The oysters were of a pretty decent size.
Our waiter Dominick said that we had to come back the next day to get their bloody marys and oyster shooters...we said "why the hell not" and ordered their oyster shooters with Patron.
Holy crap.
I was expecting an ounce of Patron with an oyster...no.
We got 3 OUNCES of Patron with an oyster.
He also made a Caesar and gave me a little bit of the leftover.
It was really good, and I am not a fan of Clamato!
Needless to say, it was a great way to start the night.
Maybe I'm not such a good Catholic...

After spending the morning and part of the afternoon driving to Vegas, it was finally time to relax.
Having read reviews of this place here on Yelp, I decided that some oysters would hit the spot, and my boyfriend agreed.
People, you were right!
We split a dozen oysters (okay, I ate most of them) and got a couple of glasses of wine.
The oysters were big, fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced.
And yay for horseradish!
The wine was priced a bit higher than in Utah.
However, our glasses would have been at least 1.5 glasses in Utah, so it worked out.
The service was quite good, and I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere of the place.
It was great to sit at the bar, relax, and occasionally glance over at the college basketball on the TV.
We seriously considered coming back here a few times during our trip, but we decided that we needed to have some variety.
However, I'll definitely be back here next time I'm in Vegas.

Ordered the seafood platter which comes with 3 of each: halved crab legs, oysters, mussels, shrimp and half a lobster tail.
Ordered another half dozen of raw oysters since they didn't have any Rockefeller's today.
Then New England Clam Chowder to warm our bellies.
I usually don't eat seafood far from the ocean since I have a seafood allergy, but from the YELP reviews I went with everyone's review and took a zyrtec just in case my food allegy starts to flare up.
Everything was fresh and service was prompt during lunch hour.
A star off since the chowder was on the warm side.
They list on the menu that the sampler comes with brandied cocktail sauce, but there was a buttery concoction that came with our order and sparked my interest to dip cold seafood into it.
It came with it for a reason, so order extra lemon aioli sauce that comes with the sampler platter.
So good!

The gnocchi with bolognese is outstanding.
Probably the best I've ever had.
Service was great.
It was a very quiet restaurant and romantic.
Give it a whirl.
You can also get a half off coupon coupons from Tix for Tonight.

Horrible.
Do not go here.
Well at least not in the later hours.
The service was HORRIBLE.
The food wasn't good.
Overall a waste of time and money.

This place is phenomenal!!!
It was so good that we had dinner here twice in a row.
We had their oysters and bouillabaisse.
Both were great!
The oysters were very fresh and the bouillabaisse (seafood soup) was very chunky and flavorful.
And on top of it all, it was very reasonably priced.
For all you vegas visitors, come check this place out!

I had the grilled oysters here, and, oh.
my.
goodness.
They  were ULTRA delicious!
YUM!
They came with red cocktail sauce, lemon, grated horseradish (the strong, sinus-clearing stuff) plus a standard appetizer of some cracker bread with a roll  that they serve before every order.
Apparently they were grilled with some butter or some sort of oil.
The cracker bread was actually perfect with the oysters, their juices and the oil.
I added some Tabasco sauce which they have available, to achieve my own personal taste perfection.
I only ordered a half-dozen, and wished I had ordered the full dozen!
Minus one star for somewhat shoddy service.
I originally ordered crab cakes, but after several minutes they came back and said that they had not been able to start them yet and suggested other menu choices - normally I would dock 2-3 stars for this, but my second-choice of the grilled oysters was delicious enough to make me an instant fan of this place.

This is the best place ever!!!!
I was never up to trying Oysters, and still to this day I only eat them from here.
They are delicious!!!!!
Clean place, great chef's!!
Affordable prices!
I crave this place all the time, I want to drive there just to eat there!!!
I had a dozen oysters, Cesar salad, and the chef gave me and my girlfriends this bomb plate, I believe it was Tiger Shrimp Brushetta.
OMG This was the greatest part!!!!
I still can't get over how FANTASTIC this tasted!!
I give this place 5 stars, and recommend it to anyone who is iffy about trying oysters!!!!!
We were all in heaven, this wasn't my first time there, however it was for my girlfriends, and they want to go back.
They did not want to eat or drink anything after to savor the taste!!

I'm not really a seafood kinda girl but the bf loves oysters so it was decided.
We trekked what seemed like miles to Harrah's and hunted down this oyster bar.
It is in the most awkward area for a restaurant.
Ordered the lobster bisque - yummy and creamy!
And I also had the salmon which was DELICIOUS!
The portion was surprisingly generous.
The salmon was nicely seasoned and the glaze was really tasty.
It's served with white rice which was kind of awkward.
The bf ordered jumbo shrimp cocktail and half dozen half shells.
I assume he enjoyed it because he didn't leave any crumbs behind.
I wasn't that impressed with the service or the place.
"meh"

My boyfriend and I went to try this place after reading good reviews on Yelp...I was disappointed.
The oysters weren't very fresh, the waiter was stuffy, and my boyfriend's salmon and rice came in little itty portions served on an oversized plate.
I also tried their "Sugar Daddy" cocktail and it tasted like Tylenol.
I don't dislike the place but I probably wouldn't go back.

Quick service and great menu selection!
This was our first experience with an Oyster Bar.
The 15$ six-shooter with Patron is highly recommend, best money I spent in Vegas and the presentation was beautiful.

The environment was great, hip, and fun.
Our waiter/chef was awesome he served up some hella good margarita that lasted me the whole night to be drunk!
Well worth it!
The food was amazing!
My sister and husband had oysters they said it was really good.
I had the risotto rice rice seafood dish.
It's similar to the Spanish Paella dish.
It has a curry cream rich elegant tang to it.
The clams, mussels, lobsters, and king prawn where a great size and I still had some left over.
It's a great sit down joint to enjoy the hustle and bustle of Harrah's without being secluded from the action.
Also our waiter/chef reminded me of Carlos Mencia with his Spanish accent; great personality and charming charisma!
He brought the food and environment alive!
My sister had the blackened fish; the flavors mingled and tinged together.
It was unique flavorful that was worth eating slow!

My friend and I were almost nearing broke when Chef "Nameless" from the Oyster Bar called out to us and told us to take a seat at the bar.
We told him our wallets couldn't handle the Oyster Bar, but he insisted that we try out his food.
I have always wanted to try this place out so i didn't put up much of a fight haha.
We sat down and ordered a dozen oysters ($20) and gobbled them down with horseradish, tabasco, and pepper- my fave.
They give you  complimentary crispy flatbread with your order, and our chef gave us a try of different types of oysters and sesame flatbread.
SO NICE!
We enjoyed every last drop and crumb of our in-between-meal, meal.
I love the service (he ended up hooking it up fatty $$$) and the food.
This is definitely going to be a must-visit spot in this city.

The oysters are like pearls of goodness....rich, fresh and succulent.
There are plenty of restaurants to choose in Vegas, and since it was my last night at Harrahs with the hubby, I really just wanted to stay in the hotel, find a good place to eat without compromising flavor.
Voila ...
Oyster Bar!
We sat at the bar and Trent our server, who's been working there for 19 years was super fabulous.
His service was impeccable and really showed that he loves his job.
So I ordered the Grilled Oysters with Garlic-Parmesan Butter and Alaskan King Crab Cocktails....both hit the spot!
I came here for Oysters and even the crab legs did not disappoint.
Overall, we had a great experience and walked away with a happy tummy.
So will I come back here again ...Absolutely!

Very fresh oysters!
Just what i needed for a miday snack!

Can we say YUM?
The last time I was in Vegas, (last year), a bunch of my friends went to the Oyster Bar inside Harrah's, while myself and others went to the pool.
They were talking about the oyster bar for days after.
So this time, I had to go.
I went with my BF and another couple in the middle of the day on a Saturday.
Not busy at all.
We sat ourselves, and look @ the menu/place mat.
We ordered 2 dozen raw oysters, (20/dozen), 2 bowls of clam chowder (6/bowl?
), and an order of Manila Clam Steamers in the White Broth (18/order), and I ordered a Mai Tai, which wasn't very strong at all and was $10.
(I have no tolerance, so if I say a drink isn't strong.. it's NOT)  The oysters were good, a little larger than I'm used to, but good.
They were served with lemon juice, cocktail sauce, and horseradish.
We asked for additional tabasco sauce.
The clam chowder was delicious.
A little thicker than I'd prefer, but good.
The clams were my favorite.
The clams were small-ish, but the broth was so, so, sooo good.
We soaked up our bread and devoured it.
I was sad when our waitress took it away.
Which by the way, our waitress, Angie, was super nice and super friendly.
Loved her.
So going back next time.

THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE OYSTER BAR ONLY:  I love coming here whenever I'm in Vegas.
You sit around a bar that has a mound of oysters in the middle.
They shuck them to order in front of you.
There are TV screens there with sports on at all times.
A dozen oysters is $20.
They used to have this item on the menu called seafood "ravioli.
" It had large chunks of lobster in it, shrimp, and other seafood...SO DELICIOUS.
Unfortunately they changed their menu.
Oh well...their other pastas are okay.
We only come for the oysters.
You can ask for the dozen half fried half raw if you want too for the same price!

FYI, I just called and Penazzi is no longer open.

It is because of this place that I fell in love with Oyster this is the reason for me to come back to Vegas.. it's so worth it.. fresh oysters, with amazing horseradish + cocktail sauce.. the amazing thing was that there was no wait!
tomorrow i am going to palace station oyster bar to do a comparison.
how can oyster be this good?
its amazing how man found God's creation..   thanks Harrah Oyster Bar.. you did well.
p.s.
i didn't know why they changed the restaurant title... it confused me... penazzi italian?
where was the italian?

OYSTERS OYSTERS OYSTERS.
I don't think I'd get anything else here...the Penazzi features oysters for a great price.
You can get 'em raw, baked, or deep fried.
The Rockerfellers are too rich for my taste (as oysters pack enough cholesterol for me) so getting a few dozen raw oysters to share with friends is what I normally do.
The ambiance here isn't great and yeah, it's Harrah's, but damn those oysters are good!

If you LOVE seafood you MUST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
visit this oyster bar in vegas!
OMG...................I go to Vegas once a month and yup I make my trip to this oyster bar every single time.
One time I went 4 times in one day.
Thats a lot of cholestrol LOL....................!
They have good Oysters and clams that come in this BOMB broth with white wine!
They also have pasta and all the seafood .
Oh yeah, they have a FULL BAR here.
The cooks are nice and very friendly.

The Oyster Bar at Harrah's has now become my go-to first night in town dinner.
The flights I get into Vegas often bring me in around 9:30pm... so with taxi travel and check-in time, I'm often now hitting the Strip until 10:30pm... AND then the hunger kicks in!
But what's open?
All the nice sit down places are usually closed at this point, but wait...
The Oyster Bar is open until 1am!
Problem solved.
:)  Not an Oyster fan?
Don't worry!
They have plenty of different seafood options as well as steaks, etc.
I've have the Mussels Fra Diavolo and the grilled Lobster tail.
YUM!
They also have a pretty decent wine list to go along with their food options.
Another plus is that it is self-seating.
You just walk in and plop yourself down and find something delicious.
I suggest sitting at the "bar" for the fastest service.

God Dammit!
Ive been very disappointed with all the places Ive been in Vegas.
I got oysters from the Oyster bar.
Hated them.
Shards were stuck in the oysters.
Absolutely nauseating.
I love my oysters with vinegar, which isnt primarily available until I asked the waiter for some.
And I asked for Old Bay.
The water alone is HORRIBLE in Vegas.
Seriously tastes like pool water.
You can taste it in the oysters.
I ordered the Alaskan King Crab legs - They were overcooked I think.
Came with potatoes, asparagus and carrots.
I didnt eat them.
I wouldve given this place 1 star.
The extra star went to my waiter, Joel - who was absolutely attentive to my requests.
The server though, didnt know where my crab legs were going - and walked right passed me.
That just peeved me because I was waiting for the longest time.

I'm not a fan of oysters but a friend of ours wanted to eat here so we gave it a try!
I had the seafood risotto which was super yummy!
It has one whole lobster tail, big shrimps, a couple of clams and mussels.
The waitress was a bit rude using the word "huh?!
" one too many times while taking our order.
The calamari wasn't anything to rave about, thin small rings what was more batter than squid.
The restaurant is very small.
Prices are ok.

Very fresh seafood and quite decent price.
Oyster is fresh, though not much variety.
The  schrimp was delicious.
The fact the I had both lunch and dinner at this place must have meant something.

We had just eaten before hitting up the oyster bar but had to come here.
We didn't want to miss it during our trip so we planned on ordering half a dozen...but really, half a dozen though?
I told my friend I could probably eat two at most since I was so full from lunch.
BUT we wanted to try a variety of oysters so we ordered half dozen Oyster Grill which was grilled with parmesan butter ($14) and half dozen Oyster Royale which was raw oysters topped with chive creme fraiche and wasabi caviar ($14).
When the oysters came out...Oh-my-God...both were really good.
By far the best oysters I have ever eaten.
You will know once you come here and try the oysters!
I left speechless...it really was a party in my mouth!
Service is excellent!
Really nice & friendly staff!
Love them!
I will definitely be hitting up the oyster bar again whenever I am in Vegas!!
I almost past this up because i had eaten so much right before coming here.
I am so glad I came!
Do not miss this place when you're in town :D  Oh, they give you a basket of crackers and bread too but I didn't eat those.
It looked tasty though!
Next time, I'll save room in my belly for the bread/crackers and MORE oysters!

Totally, totally coming back!
Fresh, cheap (for Vegas), and to the point.
Sit at the bar for quick service.
Order the oysters.
Seriously, they are fresh and delicious.
$20 for a dozen.
Guaranteed fresh, what more can you ask for?
The Seafood Risotto was $26, and really made for sharing.
There's tons of seafood in it...
Huge shrimp, lobster, clams, and scallops - all cooked to perfection.
It was awesome.
Not at all chewy and bland, like I expected, given the location and price.
I was so impressed.
The clams in broth were good as well, but when I come back... it's all about the oysters and seafood risotto.
Harrah's... who knew?

Great place to belly up to the bar when all the restaurants are full.
If you are lucky you can just jump in a seat like I did.
The kitchen is open and you can see all the food being cooked right in front of you.
Sitting at the bar you also had access to the latest sports game on the screen.
The bartender/waiter was great too.
He was prompt, attentive and kind even though he was soooo busy!
Food was good - bread was great, crunchy!
And I had a wonderful salad with shrimp that I made on special request that they had no problem making for me.
I would go back!
It's in the middle of Harrahs but once you are inside you would not remember you were in the casino.

This restaurant was a different restaurant when I wrote this review in 2008.
It is not for the Oyster Bar at Harrah's.
Interesting....

Delicious excellent food in a surprising location.
I highly recommend to anyone and am looking forward to my next visit to vegas for some great oysters and crab!

Buffets close at 10pm, so after seeing the Celine show (AWESOME!
) we weren't sure where to eat dinner; after looking around on yelp we decided on Harrah's Oyster Bar.
Harrah's itself is kinda dumpy and old, but the Oyster Bar was pretty good.
Open till 2am I believe.
We had: Crab Cakes: Eh, i've had better Clam Chowder: A+, lots of clam, thick and really good!
Shrimp Scampi: Good with HUGE shrimp; more like prawns if you ask me Oysters Royale: WOW I loved these!
Raw oysters with creme fraiche and wasabi caviar.
SO GOOD, now my second favorite way to eat oysters (1st is au natural, raw with horseradish and cocktail sauce).
Oysters Rockefeller: Also pretty good, 2 thumbs up from everyone at the table; I myself am not an oyst.
rock.
fan, but everyone else loved it.
Fresh spinach and light cheese; piping hot.
Salmon: our friend got this; looked really good!
Asian glazed.

This place is a must do whenever we're in Vegas.
The food & service are both  excellent, not to forget the view of the people walking by inside of Harrah's or are they the people of Wal-Mart walking by.
Wait,  they might be the same.
I can reccomend the Steamers in white wine, any of the Oyster plates especially the Oysters Royale.
Oh, the blackened shrip are excellent we did not order them but on our 2nd visit the chef had made an extra plate so our waiter offered them to us, a very nice comp & now we always order them.

First of all, really decent prices for the strip.
Not extremely break a hole in my pocket expensive but definitely not cheap either.
C'mon now, you're on the strip and you know what to expect people!
We had a little trouble finding this BAR hiding in Harrah's casino.
It's an actual bar where you seat yourself.
The tables are really small and the plates are all huge = problem.
We sat down on a round bar table near the bar/entrance and a waitress came over in about 1 minute.
NICE!
She was definitely helpful and extremely friendly, good service.
There was 4 of us, all guys and two of us already had beers so we were sippin' a little bit already and were looking to continue our buzz!
We both got the Oyster shooter, comes with a double shot of Patron or Grey Goose and half-dozen fresh half-shell oysters.
Of course we got Patron, and our waitress even noted that they dose a little bit of Patron on each Oyster too!
Maybe that's what made it so good!!!
They were extremely cold served on the bed of ice and tobasco/cocktail sauce and lemon!!!
Extremely delicious!!
Can you say "Gone in 60 seconds!?!
" And the shot of Patron was huge, the only bad thing was that only 2 out of 4 of us were a lil drunk by the end of dinner.
We also got the Crab Cakes and Calamari.
The crab cakes were good, very meaty and full of crab meat.
I would've liked them to be a little fluffier but they weren't bad.
Nothing outstanding either... the siracha aioli was delicious though, and the spring mix salad it was served on was gone in seconds.
The Calamari was really good!!!
Extremely crisp and good pieces, came out in a good sized fryer basket and there was even leftovers, after 4 guys dugg in on it!
Our friends ordered some type of Clam Pasta and Halibut with Risotto, they said it was okay...  All in all really enjoyed the visit here, definitely will return next time we're all in Vegas!

The Oyster Bar is actually more of a lunch counter with a few chairs and tables, and definitely a generic bar theme.
It was small but not intimate.
It was not busy this Monday late afternoon, early evening.
It read "Seat yourself" and we did but the staff seemingly ignored us.
The service was minimal.
An order was taken, food was delivered - there was no intermediate service for refills or asking how our food was or checking in on us, and then the bill.
The waiter disappeared on us twice for extended periods in this small place.
Once, he was chatting up another waiter with his backed turned to us for several minutes.
Another time, the male waiter walked quickly, hands free, right by us - with our two glasses empty, one Pepsi and another water - and didn't bother to look or notice.
A second female waiter eventually came by but by then it had been about 10 minutes.
Furthermore, when the small complimentary bread was gone, I wanted a little more but then again the waiter did not come by.
The price for my Salmon at $22, a dozen oysters at $22, clam chowder at $7, a Cosmopolitan drink at $14, and Pepsi at $3.50 plus tax and tip seemed excessive to us for the quality, portion size and (lack of) service.
My Salmon was a little dry but okay.
The Asparagus consisted of four stalks and four carrots with some okay rice.
I think many of the reviews are valid but some appear to be paid reviews to counter actual negative reviews.
On the good side, the oysters were good.

Oysters on the half shell--a dozen for $20!
The oysters are freshly shucked and you can't really go wrong with fresh oysters.
My friends and I also ordered the fried calamari appetizer and it was no good.
The calamari was heavily battered and mushy.
I'd suggest coming here for just the oysters and drinks!

3 1/2 stars.
I've been here 3 times already.
The 1st time was the best and that was a few years ago.
They had 3 different types of oysters and had some Alaskan beer that went well with it.
Today, only 2 types (blue points and fanny bay) and no more Alaskan beer.
I can eat raw oysters all day.
Seriously.
I've had 4 dozen in one sitting before and could eat more.
I mean, oysters don't even fill you up.
But the problem is, oysters tend to be kinda pricey.
That's honestly what stops me from sitting around all day and eating them.
I just run out of money.
I took my friends here-especially Luis because every time I'm at an oyster bar I text him.
I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years and I think this place started this traditional.
Well, we finally met up in Vegas so of course I have to take him.
I get some raw oysters and a dozen of their baked oysters.
Art discovers he's not too keen on raw oysters.
Well, it is an acquired taste.
James is allergic to shellfish and John and Luis don't mind them.
In fact, Luis orders the tequila shot oysters.
I can't honestly remember the last time I had a oyster shooter.
So we split all this.
The oysters are good.
The baked ones are really good.
It's rare that I enjoy cooked oysters whether baked or fried but these are really good.
I definitely recommend them.
The shooters are pretty good too.
I mean, tequila and raw oysters just mix well.
I can't say this is the best oyster bar in Vegas.
In fact with only 2 types of oysters I suspect it's not.
But for the strip it's gtg.

A super surprising find at Harrahs.
Super tasty and incredibly fresh seafood where you sit around the bar.
Great service and decent pricing (for the strip)  would definitely recommend it

We usual stay at Bally's when we stay on the strip.
It is a short walk to so many places.
Harrah's is a few casinos down the strip.
Inside the casino a ways is the Oyster Bar.
It is more or less in the middle of the casino.
They have a big circular bar and a few tables on one end and maybe some more tables inside the restaurant.
We just ambled up to the bar and sat down.
The bartender was really friendly and quick to get us situated with beers and oysters.
We got a dozen on the half shell and a half dozen Rockefeller.
The raw ones were being shucked right there by a equally friendly gal.
The bartender said the oysters were from New York.
No choice of bivalves, but I really don't need choices if the ones they have are good and fresh, which these were.
They were also not expensive, especially for the Las Vegas strip.
The Rockefeller was really good.
Very rich and saucy with the juicy oyster underneath the spinach and what not.
Quite different from the ones I had at Binion's the night before.
Overall a very good place to camp out with beer and oysters.

Its ok for a quick bite in a small casino!

This place is amazing.
The new england clam chowder was fresh and chock full of clams.
Oysters are fresh and clean.
Would definitely come back next time.
minus one star for service.
Even though the place was slow, our orders and request took forever.
There seemed to be only one host/waiter

The Oysters are huge and delicious here!!!
4 stars because service is alittle slow, but definitely worth the wait.

Okay I've been here numerous times before always for oysters but we went the past weekend for the pan roast and it was two thumbs down.
The broth was sweet for some reason and just not good.
Go for the oysters but that's all.

I have never been to an oyster bar in particular beforehand, so I did not know what to expect of the restaurant settling.
When we arrived, it looked like a place where you get in and get out.
Nothing fancy smancy.
We were not served oysters at the buffet.
Thus, we set out for oysters the following night.
We all ordered a dozen small raw  oysters.
I ordered mines half raw, half fried.
The raw oysters were very fresh and tasted delicious with the usual lemon juice and tabasco/tapatio.
YUMMM.
They were decent sized.
Some were smaller than the average.
When my fried oysters came out, they used the medium sized oysters.
They were huge.
I was not sure how I was gonna finish everything.
It came with a nice creamy orangy sauce that tasted like horse radish mixed with thousand island.
I am not sure.
I cannot identify the taste to be exact.
But all you need to know is that it is a good complimentary to the fried oysters.
It came with some salad.
Overall, my friends and I were satisfied with the food.
The service on the other hand was a bit slow.
We did not come at a busy time, it was moderate.
It took awhile for them to take our order.

If you LOVE oysters, then come here!
The oysters are super fresh and yummy!
I have been coming here for years and it never disappoints!
Raymundo is the chef that always makes my tummy crave more!
Awesome chef and even more awesome is that he remembers us each time we come back!
He prepared an excellent scallops dish for me this time around and it was fantastic!
No need to say any more....this place is great for oysters and seafood!!

5 stars for oysters, 2 stars for my fried calamari.
3 stars for the surf and turf.
Great service and good people watching.

I was delighted with my meal here.
I had the steamed clams, without pasta, which came heaped in a big bowl.
They were steamed in a garlicky, creamy broth that was really really really delicious.
After I had eaten each and every one, I dipped buttered bread into the broth and almost fainted from joy.
My husband had a giant plate of fried oysters that both of us thought were terrific.
My sister and brother in law had a crab Louis that was lovely and generous with the crab meat, although could have used more actual lettuce.
Also shared a good sized portion of fried calamari.
It was exactly what I wanted.
I used to love raw oysters but was poisoned in Texas from raw gulf oysters and can no longer indulge.
I was so envious of those were partaking around us.
This is the best restaurant at Harrah's, in my humble opinion.
Priced were fair and reasonable and service was fine.

Oyster Bar... Appropriately named.
You'll immediately notice a large iced section filled with HUNDREDS of neatly arranged oysters, an Oyster lover's paradise/heaven (ME).
You're sitting as if you're at a bar, so you're sitting on a barstool and eating on the bartop.
At least from where I was sitting, I didn't see any tables.
This place deserves 5 stars strictly for the oysters (raw and fried), the soups (Chowder and bisque), and their friendly/amazing service.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA?select=yWO6FNZ1o-Fg2cbngb-HtQ#yWO6FNZ1o-Fg2cbngb-HtQ  However, I had to knock this place down a notch because of the entrees.
The Jambalaya and shrimp scampi wasn't anything special.
They were bland and tasted much like the entrees you can order at those large chain restaurants.
Very disappointing...

Chowder was awesome.
The Oysters were good but a bit on the small side.
Service was just average.

Two words: Oysters Royale.
Raw, spicy (wasabi caviar AND amazingly fresh horseradish?!
) and perfect.
A great chive creme added a layer of smoothness and richness without taking away from the crisp, cold, amazing oysters or the flavor profile intended by the wasabi and horseradish.
#foodgasm (I would have liked larger oysters, I can admit it.
They seemed just a tad on the small side.
-0.5)  The Caesar was really tasty and, it was huge!
I don't care for tomatoes in a Caesar salad, but the overall dish was fantastic and tangy and bright.
No way could I finish it (I was saving my limited space for those fantastic oysters!
) but I gave it the old college try.
Really great.
The pan roast my date had was rich and flavorful and packed with proteins.
He said his favorite was from a place up in Reno, but this was a close second.
I loved the sauce and found the herbs really fresh and the whole thing fairly well balanced.
It needed a bit more salt to really make it pop.
Just that little something was missing (-0.5).
The lobster bite I tried was tender and juicy and I was told the rest of the fish was fantastic.
Service was on point; water and tea always full, checked on us often without hovering, and always with a smile.
And - WOW!
- so fast!
Watching them put dishes together was an added bonus of sitting at the bar.
Really a great meal, great food and generous portions, served by a great staff.
Yup, I am a fan!
Caveat: we sat at the bar.
I don't know if table service is the same, but I want to point that out just in case.

I come here and drag all my friends here every single time I go to Vegas.
I always sit at the counter.
It's so much fun to watch them cook the food.
My friends all enjoy this place because of the amazing service and food.
When I go there, they all work their schedule around it or change plans to go too!
The cooks take your order and cook the food right in front of you.
My favorite cook is Ly.
He's so nice and remembers me.
Even when I'm not in his section, he comes over to say hi.
Uh, maybe I do go to Vegas a little to often :/

When a friend brought up hitting the oyster bar at Harrah's, that he saw an ad for on the way in from the airport, I smirked, and thought he was a fool.
I was very pleasantly surprised by my experience.
The cooks double as your service staff and are honest.
And very kind... For being cooks, I was shocked at how nice they actually were.
I guess tips help...
If you ask them what's fresh, they give you honest answers - more than any service staff could every dream of, since servers don't handle the product themselves   The oysters we had were great, and fresh.
The clam chowder was one of the best I've ever had.
Chunky with clams and potatoes, flavorful, and delicious.
The steamers were awesome.
This place really impressed me, and I will plan on going back when I head into Vegas again - It'll be a great place to drown my sorrows from losing at the tables.
I'll kill my pain with fresh seafood, and white wine.
Also, quite affordable - So yea... Great place to forget those losses

I love oysters...and I always wanted to try this oyster bar...just never got the chance cuz I told myself "I'll only come here when I win" since it costs $22 for a dozen oysters.
I never did win though, and I just look and stare at the place...until this weekend, I just decided, WTH, I never win and I want oysters, I'll never get the chance...so I just went anyway.
So much for winning!
I love the oysters.
It's really good and not too "fishy" tasting.
Pricey though, wish they had specials on dead nights or something.
I would come back here if I want my oyster fix!

Highly recommended for relaxing and fun dinner before a show.
Sit at the counter for friendly, attentive service.
Clam chowder great.
Shrimp excellent.
Fish tacos delicious.
Cold seafood platter nice except for the lobster which was overcooked and not flavorful.
Tiger prawn saute looked fabulous as so did the salads.

I really didn't find this place to have great good; I also don't eat seafood which might be what you are expected to order here.
I felt like I was eating in the middle of a hallway in the casino as the seating was surrounded by major walkways.
I got the steak and didn't find it to be great.
I enjoyed my five dollar steak at Ellis Island more.
I found the food and service to be lacking here.
I'll upload a photo when I get a chance.
My girlfriend said the fish and chips was great though!

What a pleasant surprise this place was!
While my wife and I stayed at The Palazzo, my brother and niece stayed at Harrah's so, I found myself there a few times.
Fortunately for me, a couple of those times were around lunch time and we wound up at the Oyster Bar.
Frankly, was not expecting much as Harrah's overall just seems a bit meh.
The Oyster Bar was far from meh though even if only rating the quality of the oysters.
They were ice cold, perfectly briny and served with some kick butt hot horseradish to add to your cocktail sauce.
Ate 4 dozen between the two lunches.
Also tried the seared tuna one of the days.
It was good, not great like the oysters though.
The only true downer was the clam chowder which was average at best.
If you're in the neighborhood and craving some oysters, hit this place and you won't be disappointed!

The service, food, and scene were excellent.
I will return, fresh seafood in the middle of nowhere, WOW!!

Per the other comments I really didn't have unrealistic expectations of something in Harrah's and I've stayed there several times without dining here.
Harrah's is a nice place, value priced but not where you'd expect to find anything outside of the curve.
Also understand that I've never given five stars unless the food is extraordinary or the service is benchmark.
So, I just had dinner with a work associated and I'm impressed enough to give it five.
Trent, along with a woman who's name escapes me were gracious, attentive, honest and very knowledgeable.
They get the top rating however the food was also delicious.
In all, an oyster shooter, Six oysters royale which were divine, six grilled oysters with parmesan, quite good, I had the Carolina crab boil and my friend had the seafood risotto.
Both were ample portions, cooked correctly and Trent even had extra garlic tossed into the boil which is something I'd acquired a taste for in Louisiana.
Go for the food at fair prices (for the quality) and stay for the friendly and conversational service.
I'll be back and I don't tread over the same ground often, especially around here!

Juicy Oysters and Oyster shooters!!
Service here is awesome!!
Everyone is so friendly and nice, especially an asian guy named Ly.
He gives wonderful service to every single customer.
Having excellent attentive service makes the dining a much better experience for all.
Must try the oyster shooter with I believe it's called Asian Bomb alcohol which is a mixture of sake and some other stuff which makes it taste so unique.
It is soooo good!!!
It will kick your butt without the alcohol taste.
It's 3 for $12 I think but it's so worth it!!!
Oysters are fresh and delicious!!
There's different kinds of oysters which Ly explained to us.
I can't remember it of course, but there's a Japanese one and a southern one and blablabla.
I tasted 2 different kinds and they were sooo good!!
I love how it's already cut from the shell and ready to slurp.
A must try!!!
Also tried seafood cioppino, shrimp appetizer, and steamed mussels.
They were all very delicious as well.
The shrimps are big here so it was really good.
They put in some salsa-ish taste to the mussels while being steamed which makes it very juicy.
Great place to eat in Vegas if you're sick of the buffets.
Definitely a must try in Vegas.
The only problem you'll have is the price, but that's at any juicy oyster bar.

Came here twice, once on each visit to Vegas.
Oysters are incredibly fresh.
You can watch the chefs make their dishes from the counter/bar area where you eat.
I used COMP points here both occasions ^^

Thanx Yelpers for helping me find this place!!
Best oysters ever.
Super good crab cakes The best oysters rockefeller  The mussels were just "okay", though But everything else was SO good and most importantly the oysters in an oyster bar were so good that 5 stars all the way.
Plus, super big bonus for giving me a free bloody mary oyster shooter!!
Really good bloody mary too.

Everything you expect at a great restaurant found in such a small place; inside a hotel too!
The food: We had the oysters, the clam chowder, and the rib eye the four times we came here.
First of all, the clam chowder is the best I have ever eaten!
I absolutely LOVE clam chowder and eating it here delighted my taste buds so much that my mouth almost leaped for joy that first taste.
In my humble opinion, the rib eye steak here has got to be the best steak in Vegas.
Eating at other places, we thought it was really salty.
Personally, I think they go a bit overboard with their spices, but here, it was simply amazing to see that this place advertises oysters and yet, their steak is the best in Vegas!
Very funny in a sense.
Now, the oysters!
The oysters taste great, very fresh, and worth the price.
One time, they had special oysters flown in from Japan.
Six dollars more for a dozen, but my goodness, worth the price!
Once you put them in your mouth, they just melted; leaving your mouth in such ecstasy; that you wonder how you have ever lived without tasting such great food.
The one thing I do not suggest are their Bloody Marys.
I thought it was way too salty and they should balance how much vodka they use.
It overpowered the tomato juice and accentuated on the saltiness rather than a little bit of both spiciness from the Tabasco and the complimentary taste of the tomatoes.
The service: Every time we came here, the service was excellent.
We never waited too long with the food, and every few minutes the waiter would tell us about how the food was coming along.
Plus the kitchen is not too far from view so you could see if they were lying or not.
They appeased our cravings by giving us what we needed with our food.
Everyone was always smiling which made this place so inviting.
This place should be bigger and more advertised, and has become one of our go to places when we come to Vegas.
With superb service and food, this restaurant is one of our Vegas trip highlights when thinking about food.
Happy yelping.

What a yummy and reasonably priced place!
Some people I was with said the crab cakes were too salty.
Clam Chowder was AMAZING!!
Had the Oyster/Seafood for 2 App which was delish.
The flat sesame cracker/bread was sooo good.
Wine list was decent.
One of my friends had Halibut and said was good.
Other had Oysters Rockefeller and said was tasty.
My bf said calamari was fabulous.
Price for fresh seafood was decent.
I liked it!

This place is soooo yummy!
Everything I tried was good.
I never really had oysters but I don't think i'll eat them anywhere else but here.
It's pretty pricey but then again seafood is always expensive.
I recommend this place to anyone that likes seafood

Fantastic oysters and a really nice crab louie salad.
Service was a bit off on my visit - and the place could stand an update.
Really - who care the food is fresh and delicious.

Great oysters!!
Clam chowder and calamari were also very good.
The crab cakes were just okay.
If you love oysters go to this place, yum!

I was skeptical about dining here cuz it seemed random n out of place in Harrahs but man was I WRONG WRONG WRONG!!!
Amazing oysters great vibe excellent service I can't wait to go back in March!!
A must stop if u like tasty seafood!!

Truly a 4.5, but I'm in a good mood so I might as well round up!
I was apprehensive about coming here for dinner, but it was delicious and affordable (for vegas standards).
The Clam Chowder ($7) is to die for (probably the best clam chower I've had outside of San Francisco and Monterey)!
The Oysters on half shell ($23 for dozen) are fresh and sweet.
I had the Steamed Clams in White Wine sauce($19) with pasta (+$2).
Overall, one of the best meals I've had in Vegas and I would definitely come back!

Another great spot that Yelpers lead me to.
The decor and the high tables and chairs weren't ideal, but the food was outstanding.
Following Yelpers' advice, we tried the clam chowder to start, and as reviewed, it was outstanding, reminiscent of the best I'd had in Boston.
We also received some good bread to start our meal, which was nice.
We then followed with an oyster dish, forget the name, but it was oysters with spinach and parmesan and a horseradish sauce on the side.
AWESOME.
We ordered six, but I would've liked about twenty more.
We then had the shrimp jambalaya, which although not entirely NO authentic, was still very good.
The shrimp were especially good.
It seemed they'd been grilled first and then thrown in the jambalaya, creating a really complex flavor.
I really liked this spot.
I also liked that by strategically ordering the chowder and the oysters, we were able to save some money, as the place is on the expensive side if you get chowder, an appetizer and two entrees.

I would give this restaurant a 0 star if I can.
The worst restaurant ever.
The service was bad.
The lady in the kitchen doesn't wear gloves at all.
I sat there for 10 minutes watching her dig her long fingernails into all sorts of food, grabbed dirty cash with her hands, and went back to digging into food again.
So disgusting.
Then saw another man put back the leftover sauce into a container that they would later scoop out for the next customers.
I told the manager what I just witnessed and all she could say was: "I'm sorry, I'll tell the chef about it"  THAT'S IT !!!
While the manager was talking to me, the lady was still digging her naked hands into the food.
What the Fuck !!!
Nastiest place ever.
This restaurant should be shut down immediately.

We stopped by for a light lunch after arriving in Vegas on a Sunday afternoon.
The Oysters are truly fantastic and if I were in the area would definitely stop by for a half dozen - or dozen depending on how hungry I was.
So if I were rating this place on just the oysters it would probably get a 5.
I gave it a 3 rating for a few reasons; the bread they served was flavorless, it is basically in the middle of the casino so the atmosphere is lacking (and hard to avoid the smoking), and the clam chowder had very little clams - it was basically butter and cream soup.
I love butter and cream - but I wanted clam chowder and there just weren't any.

Too bad the lowest is 1 star and not 0....  Where do I start?
The worst dinner in LV!
I was yelping around to grab a bite before heading to the piano bar.
Since it has 4 starts, i figured it couldnt be bad... oh boy... was i wrong.
Food:   Oysters were already pre-opened.
who knows how long they've been sitting there uncovered.
It's raw food!
Dont you think it should be handled better?
Crab salad:  The crab leg was still FROZEN when i tried to eat it?!
wtf... the green leaves were black and beat up.
dude, a $20 salad cant even have crispy leaves?!
the crab salad itself?
it tasted like you brought the tuna salad to your pinic and let it sit under the sun.
**YUCK**  After the nasty taste, the plate was still full.
I didnt even touch my dinner because of what we had to see.
I didnt ask how my friend liked his orders but he didnt really eat his dinner.
Service: OHMYGOD!!!!
it's disgusting!!!
Just thinking about it now gives me goosebumps.
The lady named Rosi...she's the worst person to ever be in the food industry left alone at Harrah's.
Since our waiter was too busy talking to the other customer even though we tried to get his attention for too long; we looked at her to see if she can help us get our waiter.
Her response was " your waiter is over there.
"  No sh*t, i know that, so i asked if she can help me get him.
Her response was "he will come when he comes".
WTF?!
She was just standing there!
Then she started to clean up.... oh man, this is the worst part, Rosi.
She started to dig to the dirty containers to consolidate things BARE handed while a box of gloves was right in front of her.
We sat at the bar, so we saw everything.
She then wiped her hands to her uniform shirt, no not an apron, where she had been leaning against everything!
Then she moved on to dig into the raw shrimps, lobster tails, ..., pushing them down to cover them with those bared dirty hands w/ long red finger nails.
Not to mention, she wore a dangling bracelet that touched everything!
**YUCK**  Again, it's raw food!!!
oh then, her co-worker came and gave her share of tips, she touched the money, too, then went back to touching the food.
really?
I wanted to throw up bc I didnt know if she touched my food.
So we stopped eating.
Another guy came over, brought the finished plate from previous eaters, grabbed the leftover cocktail sauce from that plate and put it back in the big container where they scooped out the sauce for the next customers.
Really?
you can charge people $23 for a dozen, yet you re-used the sauce from a raw dish.
So, we paid $100 for a dinner that we didnt touch.
We paid $100 to watch how disgusting this place was!
My friend didnt even want to pay cz we didnt even eat!
we would rather spend $100 on in-n-out!
All the manager said was, she would bring it to the chef's attention and ran for her life.
I wouldnt be surprise if people get food poisoning from this place.
I went and took my digestive enzymes right way, and drank more alcohol at a different place to kill the germ, well at least mentally, it would, after seeing that disgusting Rosi.

Great fresh and affordable its in the back of the casino.
We had oyster rockefeller and Cesar salads they were great and affordable.
The chowder looked great also but I was too full to order some.
Will eat there next time I'm in town for sure!

Never a disappointment,,,, Oysters a various selection,,, tuna tartar  plenty and good!!!
Fried calamari needs some improvement...
I shall return!!!

Our waiter completely ignored us the first 4 times he walked by us after seeing the adjacent table.
No " I will be right with you" or anything of that sort.
After finally getting a hold of him and preventing him from running away he was nicer the rest of the meal.
The oysters were puny!
But at least they were fairly fresh.
For two people we ordered  half dozen oyster rocker feller ( good and rich) half dozen oyster royale ( this was gross, i had to force myself to finish it) dozen raw oysters crab louie salad ( generous crab portions, avocado was black however) parmesan crusted halibut ( i think was decent)  The lady shucking the oyster was moving at a snail's pace.
We waited forever while we watched her shuck them in slow motion.
It was similar to waiting for water to boil.
She really should stop talking to the cook and needs to concentrate on working more.
We didn't complain but our server actually came over several times to point out he knew it was taking a while.
He even looked over at her and said "she is very slow".
The table to the right of us complained about how long their order was taking, as did the table to our left; both tables arrived way after we did.
Bill was about 115.

The food matched the service - good but not great.
I honestly expected more of a selection of oysters when I walk into a place called "Oyster Bar" because that's why I go there.
They had the standard Bluepoints as part of their regular menu and three "premier" oyster options.
I ordered a dozen of their premier oysters on the half shell, Shigokus.
They were pretty darn good, and at $30, they should be.
Also had the bacon-wrapped scallops which were tender and juicy.
The Maryland crab cakes were also very good.
Their crab cakes were more the finely shredded type and no large chunks of crab, which I personally like to have.
For entrees I tried their special (New Your strip and fried soft shell crab) as well as their Jambalaya steamer.
The steak was good but the soft shell crab was a bit soggy.
The steamer had a good assortment of shellfish but a few clams were quite gritty from the sand.
The dessert menu was an afterthought and I ordered the Oreo cookie ice cream cake.
The service was a bit slow and the server didn't seem too knowledgeable about the handful of oysters being served.
I'd expect the waiters to be able to tell where an oyster came from and when it came in.
Is it firm or soft?
Salty or sweet?
Metallic, buttery, creamy, briny??
As an oyster bar, I wasn't terribly impressed.
Also the server added his own gratuity to the bill for me and two guests.
Really?
Altogether, with the $22 tip, the check was about $160 for three people.
Would I go here again?
Not likely.
I've had better $160 meals and I'd rather try a real oyster bar.

I came here with the bf and ordered the clam chowder and the day's special, which was some sort of Japanese oyster.
The clam chowder, was just alright, I've definitely had better.
The oysters were really yummy.
Very creamy tasting just like the chef had assured us.
It was served with cocktail sauce and horseradish.
I suggest going REALLY light on the horseradish, it's super strong and spicy, but adds a nice kick if you're into that.
I also ordered a lemon drop while the bf ordered the an Anchor Steam Beer to support a SF brewery, both ended up being really yummy as well.
Overall, this place isn't too bad, but nothing too memorable in my opinion.

We stay at Harrahs regularly so it is convenient to eat here, but that is not the reason we do.
This place has some of the best prepared seafood I have ever eaten.
The oysters are flown in daily so despite a negative review I read on here they are FRESH !
All the waiters are taught to prepare all the dishes which make it very convenient.
The following are dishes which I have enjoyed; creamy clam chowder, shrimp cocktail, crab cakes (superb), a shrimp dish with bruschetta under it, king crab and on and on!
You will not be disappointed if you venture over to Harrahs and belly up to the bar!
Enjoy!

Can you ever go wrong with bacon wrapped scallops?!
Such soft scallops wrapped with slightly crispy bacon...
Enough said.

Food was just ok.
Nothing special about it.
Service was ok. Server forgot to bring my water out for almost ten minutes, until I reminded him.
Also waited a while for the check.
Would have been 2 stars, but he made up for it at the end by trying to hold a conversation with us.

Looking for the best oysters on the strip without driving, this spot is the best.
Small, but reasonably priced for the quality.

A must visit every time I come to LV.
It's not cheap- a half dozen is about $15 and a full is $23.
You don't get to choose your type of oyster either, but I enjoy it, along with the bread basket- crisp sesame flatbread accompanied with house rolls.
The shrimp in the $17 cocktail are enormous, but you only get 4.
I like their house cocktail sauce.

I went here for a light dinner.
One word that sums this place up is "delish!
"  I loved it.
The crab cakes were on point, the bread basket was nice and warm, the dozen oysters were so fresh.
I asked for pico de gallo for the oysters and our waitress brought it right out.
She was really pleasant and checked on us regularly.
She suggested the oyster shooters in the glass, and omg!!
Yummy Buzz!!
We got 2 plain with just tequila and the other one with the pineapple juice and jalapeño mixture.
I would go back here for the crab cakes any day.
I forgot our servers name, but she was a really cool hispanic girl, with a memorable laugh.
:D in a good way.
This is my new "we HAVE to go there" place when I'm in Las Vegas.

I've been to this place several times and I always enjoyed it until my last visit there.
This place has the WORST service ever.
We sat down at the bar around midnight and we were ready to spend some money.
Wow... Where do I even begin with thr service.. Trent was the worst server I have ever had in my life.
I asked him for our bread after waiting for about 10 minutes.
He completely ignored me and then later came wuth the bread without saying a word.
I then asked him if they had pan roast available.
He said "uhhhh pan roast.....alright...." and then went off again.
I assumed that he put our order in.
15 mins later I asked him nicely if our pan roast was coming out and then he replies "uhhh...
The pan roast.... Uhhhh" and then he just dissapears again!!
Unbelievable... At this point, my boyfriend and I are so annoyed that we immediately ask for our check for the oysters we ordered from a different server.. And guess what??
He ignores us again.
-_- Finally we yell at him for the check and when he came out with the check I gave him my players card and asked him for my discount.
He then starts complaining about how he needs to go back and redo the whole check.
SO FKN WHAT?!!
wow we were so fed up at this point, we let him have it.
We pretty much told him he was the worst server ever and how we would never come back.
The worst dining experience ever... Go to the oyster bar at Palace Station.
The drive is well worth it, the food and service is a million times better than this.
This place should get 0 stars for its crappy service but I'm being nice by taking the food into consideration so they get a regretful 2 stars in my book.

So im sitting in my room at Harrahs yelping away, trying to find places to eat... and behold a oyster bar???
what?
heaven has spoken to me....  so after watching phantom of the opera we decided to go back and try the oyster bar.. since i love oysters my bf not so much.. lol he wasn't really excited to go but he did it for me.
walking in no body greeted us so we sat ourselves... someone came to get or order he was pleasant enough it was kinda busy so we understood the long pauses in between.
what we ordered:  1/2 dozen fresh oysters: kinda small but really fresh it was really good only own side i kept getting shell in my mouth like a lot of shell... i love eating it with a splash of lemon, a dash of tabasco and a dollop of cocktail sauce with extra horseradish   1/2 dozen oyster rockafeller: my first time having it, it had a nice flavor but it was kinda overwhelming it has a nice garlic flavor and topped with spinach and some type of cheese  it was a little too much tho i do think i could have ate a full dozen add a little splash of lemon to cut the heaviness  calamari: crunchy pieces... i love how they includes the tentacles that my favorite part topped with lemon, my bf preferred the marinara i just used my yummy cocktail sauce.
but it did come with a good aoili sauce as well   fish tacos: I didn't personally try it so i cant say much but my bf love it... only down part was there was too much sauce on the taco..   all in all if I'm back in vegas I'm defiantly coming back.. btw the bus boy was the niceest of them all like he was like asian and had a ponytail he was so nice.!

Harrah's Casino!
Came here for the Mac King show and was a little hungover/early so my friend and I decided to grab a few drinks here.
Sat at the bar and we were promptly greeted from the other side.
What we ordered: 1/2 Oysters - SO fresh and SO good.
Watch them shuck them right before your eyes (if you're sitting at the bar that is).
Tasted so fresh!!
Their horseradish was really REALLY good.
It's an oyster bar, MUST HAVE.
Bowl of Clam Chowder - This clam chowder was AMAZING.
I loved how they put a generous amount of clam... they were huge too!!
Perfectly chewy and not overpowering at all.
I love how I didn't feel bits of sand like other places...!
Bloody Mary - HANDS DOWN THE BEST BLOODY MARY I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!
And I've had a CRAPTON!
Please try!
Service is very quick and prices are fair for Vegas :P Highly recommend this place!

We were happy to find a moderately priced restaurant in the heart of tourst-trap land.
I ordered the Shrimp Jamabalaya.
The Mrs. had the crab salad.
We both were pleased but not bowled over.
The service was fine.
It's in the heart of the casino, so don't expect a dull atmosphere.
Given the nearby choices, we would return here.

This isn't by any means a high-end seafood experience, but it's in the Harrah's so I wasn't going into it with high expectations anyway.
The seat-yourself aspect of going into the place was a little confusing and the service furthered that confusion.
After a good while of sitting at the high tables facing the casino, one server brought in the bread and said she'd take our order but then turned around and left saying there was a "shift change.
" Once we got the right server sometime later, we ordered the Oysters Rockafeller, Jumbo Fried Oysters, Seafood Risotto, and the Lobster Ravioli as an appetizer.
Everything came out at the same time, so whatev on the appetizer.
The ravioli was reportedly good.
The oysters were my order; the fried oysters were better than the Rockafeller, but was still a pretty simplistic dish.
It was only good in the way that anything fried is good.
The Rockafeller dish was alright; I've had better at home in Washington for less.
They were a little gritty..
I definitely got my calcium dose for the day in shell bits.
I recommend putting on the Tapatio hot sauce that was conveniently on the table for those.
The seafood risotto was alright but my fiancé wasn't thrilled about having to de-shell every mussel, every shrimp and lobster tail for that dish.
The food quality gives this review it's 3 stars; only to be topped by real coastal restaurants with fresh seafood coming in daily.
The service was lackluster but not the worst I've seen in Vegas.
Situated right in the middle of the casino, it offers a great view of the usual tenants at Harrah's: hardened casino grandma's hovering over the slot machines.

My first impression was, "Raw oysters and cajun food, I'm so there.
"  Located in the midst of all your slot machines at Harrah's, you really don't need to go anywhere else in the middle of your fun testing your luck.
You won't have to take a chance with this place because the food is actually very good, and good quality, despite the fact that its not actually a restaurant but more a booth in the middle of all the slot machines.
We had fried oysters and the cajun jambalaya.
The seasoning for the jambalaya was so flavorful and rich, but not overpowering.
They don't skimp on the shrimp and sausages (yummy) and the portions are great to share with an appetizer and drinks.
It's seriously amazing how all this great food comes out of a station kitchen.
The service is great, and the setup really adds to the Vegas atmosphere.
Fine dining options are vast on the Strip, but sometimes you're in need of a little convenience to your fun without sacrificing great taste.
The Oyster Bar is your answer!
The lasting impression?
"Quick bite pit stop, or a place to wind down, it's the perfect place for oysters and more.

Terrible service!!!
Food was good but not super great and unfortunately my husband received his almost 15 minutes before I received mine.
He never got water even asking for it several times.
The waiter did offered to reheat his dinner but at this point we just wanted to leave.

Not fancy and not overly clean (the menus are gross), but it keeps me coming back year after year.
The GF and I are creatures of habit and always get the same items: Oysters Rockefeller, bacon wrapped scallops, shrimp scampi and steamed clams in white wine sauce.
All are very good, especially considering Las Vegas isn't really a seafood Mecca being that its in the middle of the desert.
I can't forget to mention the oyster shooters.
I'd suggest manning-up and taking one or two.
It'll help numb the guilty feeling you have from blowing all that money on the tables.

My girl loves the Oysters Royale w/ Wasabi Caviar bit pricey but worth her smile.
I personally do not like oyster's all that much but hear these are an amazing appetizer/small meal.

[3.5 stars]  Oysters...freaking raw oysters.
Who wouldn't like raw oysters (with my lady and those with liver disease as the only exceptions)?
Oysters that are arranged immaculately in their half shell by the dozen on a clean plate displaying their luscious-naked-selves in preparation for your partaking.
Since my caveman days in Vegas, I have frequented this spot to get a little extra oyster fix due to the freshness and quality as well as varieties offered here.
Not to mention, it was CHEAP enough to overindulge.
But time always seems to dull the glimmer of any establishment in Vegas.
At the very least, you will always eventually begin to notice some form of gradual decline like the dents and scratches that appear on a once-new car.
This oyster bar is no different.
If I was to review a few years ago, Harrah's Oyster Bar would have received a raving 5-star review.
Now, it sits merely on a 3.5-star bar stool (instead of a throne) and has lost its luster like I would say of spots at ol'Vegas.
(Packed but having an absence of a LONG queue).
The oysters are still okay but for some bloody unknown reason, the shucking has become a lot clumsier in the last year as I find more bits of shell in the oysters as I down each half shell.
This just ruins the overall oyster consuming experience for me.
Perhaps, they're having a bad day OR the oysters decided to go on strike together with the oyster union and extending their crap to the "taxpayers".
The Cioppino and the Bouillabaisse, which act as my main course after downing all those oysters, have also lost its mind-blowing flavor.
I can only pout now and visit this establishment more as a continued habit than as a personal food preference.
Service still remains close to stellar and I have always been treated like royalty.
Le'sighs.

Exceptional Service along with the exceptional food.
Oysters were succulent, dinner entree was delicious.

Stopped here on my way back to Wyndham  Dessert Inn, Harrah's is where the shuttle bus picks up for Wyndham customers and let me tell you this, after a disappointing experience at Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace where  oyster were good but shuckers at Bacchanal were slackers, too SLOW opening the well liked oysters , here at Oyster Bar at Harrah's, Rosi was quick in keeping up & opening up the fresh and plump Blue point oysters, they also have two other kind of oysters that you can try .
Service was good thanks to Trent.
I will back and will try the French Kiss oysters.

If I could AFFORD this, I'd come a few more times :).
For a first visit, I left pretty satisfied and on a positive note.
So, I'm going to review while it's still fresh on my mind -- and it'll be my first review of the 2013 year!
(I posted 6 photos, as well.
) I only came cause my sister got me some dining voucher comps.
WHAT WE ORDERED: 3 shooters (Bloody Mary, Asian Bomb, & Tequila Lime) $14 -- okay, these are definitely NOT my thing.
My friend finished all 3.
I only had sips.
It's the alcohol, bleh.
Bourbon Street Jambalaya w/ Chicken $18 -- This wasn't too bad; it wasn't delicious or anything, but it was pretty decent.
Sauteed clams in white sauce -- Typical clams but it was pretty sandy.
There were about 3 closed ones and I managed to open one and it was just very BLACK and sandy.
Wasn't a pretty sight.
Oyster Grill (half-dozen) -- This was one of the better things I had tonight.
Yum!
I'd totally get it again.
Prices are definitely not in my budget but I'd really like to try the other things on their menu (i.e.
the seafood platter for two) so if chance gives me it, maybe I'll be back one day...  PS: Get a TOTAL REWARDS card.
The prices are cheaper by only a $1, but hey, it adds up!

This is a favorite of my dad's.
I think we come at least once when we make a Woo family trip.
Relatively inexpensive compared to most seafood joints on the Strip, Oyster Bar at the Harrah's offers decent food in a bar like atmosphere.
It's literally a circular shaped establishment.
A bar with seats around it and a few belly tables surrounds the outer corners.
There isn't much walking space at all.
Forget about the salads and the entrees!
I think the calamari is the best darn thing on the menu.
The batter is super flavorful so you don't really need to use the dipping sauce.
All you need is a squirt of citrus-yum, my mouth is salivating at the thought of it!
Since it's an Oyster Bar, def try something in their Oyster section.
For those who don't like raw seafood,  I highly recommend the Bouillabaisse and Cioppino.
My mom likes those two dishes a lot.

We come here often and it's hidden away in a corner of Harrah's.
They have good rib eye steaks, cioppino, and steamed clams.
I get the clams in white sauce and I add pasta, which makes it into a delicious clam pasta dish.
Their clam chowder is also really good, but it's a huge bowl.
They also started having fish tacos, and the fish is nicely grilled and it comes with a side of guacamole.
Don't get the lobster because it's usually overcooked.
Service is great, the place is laid back, and it's a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of the casino.

The raw oysters here are absolutely delicious!!
I don't know what it is that makes it taste so good, but they are delicious.
I heard their other location is even better.. will have to check that out next time.
It was so good, my friend and I ordered another dozen oysters between the two of us - towards the end of our lunch!

Meh.
I was unimpressed.

Came for brunch before the Superbowl.
I love how you can sit at the bar and watch the action.
I saw all the tips on great Clam Chowder, so I had to try it out.
Awesome.
Best I've had in Vegas!
We tried the Peel & Eat Shrimp which had a delicious grilled flavor with seasonings and peppers.
Crab Cakes were delicious, served with a fresh salad and aioli type sauce.
And, of course, I had to polish it all off with a half dozen Oysters!
Fresh & delicious!!!
We'll be back, great food, service & ambiance!

This is one of my go to places in Vegas.
It's not the fanciest but the food is good.
The oysters are always on point!
The first time I came here, a year ago - the pan roast was perfect!
This time, it was still good but overcooked.
They were kind of busy so I won't hold it against them but this place is definitely worth a try.
If you're an oyster fan and want something good at reasonable prices for being on the strip - come here!

First time my wife and had Oysters!
No need to be seated by a host, just take a seat anywhere.
Service was on point.
We loved it!
I cant say that I would choose to eat oysters all the time but i did enjoy the experience and we got to try differnt breeds (i had no idea there was different kinds, i also did not realize that they are still alive when you eat em... weird) with different toppings.
I had the surf and turf and can highly recomend it.
The fillet mignon was as good as any but it was the lobster tail that had me drooling.
Im not a huge fan of Lobster tail as it usually has the texture of prawns.
This tail was the most tender piece of meat!
The flavor was off the chain and it was as tender as a piece of white fish.
LOVED IT!

Been coming here for several years, always sit at the bar and the chat with the chef's Ly, Trent and Dennis are fantastic all three of them have been there for some time and know their stuff, the food while not cheap is reasonably priced and with a Total Rewards Card you get $1 off many of the items.
Oysters are always fresh, the Surf and Turf is perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful.
It's hard to come up with enough words to praise the quality and freshness of their Sea Food, and the clam chowder..... We live by the beach and have to drive 300 miles to get the best tasting Clam Chowder I've ever had, rich, creamy and stuffed FULL of clams, no skimping here just pure quality and flavor.
Everything we've ever had here has been exceptional, you can't miss and for some good conversation with some great guys sit at the counter.

I can't believe I've been staying Harrah's all these times and I have never tried the Oyster bar!
What is wrong with me!?
I'm so glad I was able to dine here with my family before watching Legends in Concert (show in Harrah's, see review).
It's a rather small spot, super open to the casino so when we walked in, the staff behind the oyster bar told us to sit wherever we wanted.
We sat at the bar, not inside the restaurant but on the oyster side of the bar.
There were five of us so we managed to pull together three SMALL round tables to fit our drinks and bread and butter our waitress brought out.
Cool!
It was a tight squeeze though!
Bread and butter, yum!
Nice, crusty and wheat bread with room temp butter, yes I was drooling.
My mom ordered the clam chowder and a CRABBY mary.
The crabby mary has a nice sea taste that I loved.
It was pretty strong, I had to help mom finish it, lol.
Clam chowder tasted like the sea!
The chowder was super chunky and the bowl was pretty big.
We ordered two, two-dozen oysters and six oyster shooters.
The oysters were really good!
Kept fresh with good horseradish and cocktail sauce was the perfect topping.
The horseradish sauce was super strong which is hard to find at some oyster/seafood place.
The oyster shooters were six oysters topped with vodka and an extra-large shot of vodka chilled in the middle.
My sister, her fiancé and my dad and I were all buzzin!
The bill was pricey but it was well worth it.
Good food with family making more crazy memories in Vegas = priceless.

Fresh oysters and blackened scallops pasta!
So yummy at reasonable prices too.
I have to come here every time I go to vegas!

One of my favorite spots on Vegas.
Usually the first place we go to after we check in.
And the service was awesome.

They always serve the absolute best new england clam chowder i've ever had.
It's fantastic.
I stay at Rio but always journey to the strip just to have a bowl of this stuff.

Came here for a late night snack.
Ordered the mixed plate and they gave us a variety.
For condiments it was lemon, tabasco, pico de gallo, red wine vinegar with scallion.
Ordered some Corona's to wash it down.
When we were eating we witnessed some being smoked up on the grill N'awlins style.
Asked the people next to us and they said they had a nice smoked flavour but were not true New Orleans style!
Dang good man!

Awesome!
So simple, so ready, so quick, so delicious!
No host to wait for.
Start with sweet warm soft buns with whipped butter.
Followed by $24/dozen oysters in a half shell.
Watch the staff clean, ice the plate, add the horseradish, lemon half and cocktail sauce, shuck and place the oyster, then voila!
They have an assortment of oysters and they probably give you mixture.
Or if you prefer just one type, let them know.
Had a couple sit by me and I guess they're regulars...with their order, it was a modified dish of oysters in a half shell and a oyster shot.
Oysters were laid out as so perfectly prepared in a iced circular formation and the staff seasoned each half shell with a VERY GENEROUS amount of grey goose vodka!
I can only imagine had good that was and how drunk I could have gotten.
Ordered the jambalaya with chicken and it was great!
So filling.
Chicken grilled and amazingly juicy and tender.
The rice and sauce was just enough spice to tempt you for your next bite.
Zesty without being overpowering.
Loved the sausage...they were not overly salty or spicy, it was just right.
I almost wished I didn't have to go to the nightclub and just go home so I could have taken doggy bagged my jambalaya!

a whole lotta oysters..  and yes they are good!

So my sister has been telling me about this place for ages, finally had a chance to try it.
I was not disappointing.
Love the casual feeling of this place, you can walk up to the bar and sit or at one of the high tables.
Started off with half dozen oysters, perhaps one of the best, freshest, delicious oysters I had ever tasted!
For main course BF had Cioppino and i ordered shrimp scampi pasta.
The pasta dish had too much sauce, waaay to much and I almost sent it back but I ended up putting napkins to suck up some of it (TMI??).
But the flavor was great.
BF loved the  Cioppino, all kinds of differed shell fish in a tomato cream sauce.
They also serve bread and crackers.

Great place for fresh or Rockefeller oysters, and a good selection of fresh oysters!
This could be a bit pricey but then again, you are in Vegas.

This place is sooo affordable compared to other Vegas restaurants.
I had their Crab Louis Salad and that was amazing!
Their oysters on the halfshell is very fresh and yummy as well.
Remember to ask for the Louisiana hot sauce!
My cousin had the scallop pasta., which is made to perfection!
My brother had the clam chowder for $7 and it's the best clam chowder ever!
This is open seating so grab a table.
The food is really fantastic and obviously.
I came here more than once!
Mouth drooling as I'm writing this review.
Yummy.
Every single dish we ordered was cooked to perfection and it was all delicious!
Can't wait to go back to Vegas and I'm not skipping out at the Oyster Bar at Harrah's.
They've got me hooked!

I was craving some good Jambalaya on the Strip and I heard the Oyster Bar at Harrah's makes a very good one.
So, being the sucker I am for Jambalaya, I gave the Oyster Bar a visit!
I love how the kitchen/oyster bar is in the center of restaurant with seats all around facing the action.
It was nice entertainment watching the chefs crank out dish after dish and shucking oysters in rapid fire mode.
Let's get to the Jambalaya...  Boubon Street Jambalaya with Shrimp -- Smoked shrimp,andouille sausage, and tasso ham tossed with rice and topped with zesty sauce piquant.
http://bit.ly/11dqRp8 It's not the best Jambalaya I've ever had, but it was still very good!
Huge pieces of shrimp, a nice amount of rice, and lots of andouille sausage.
A surprise in every bite just as every Jambalaya should have.
Plus I loved the spicy kick it had!
The Oyster Bar is very casual and inviting and if you have a craving for seafood at decent prices, this is the right place for you.
Plus they're open pretty late till 11pm which is also a plus if you want to get a nice casual seafood dinner after a show.
I have to go back to try their other stuff, especially their oysters.
Overall, solid dining spot!

DO NOT COME HERE FOR THE PANROAST.
- overpriced - Palace Station's panroast is 100x better  Clam chowder (4/5) - This was good Calamari (3/5) - Just okay  I must say, i did NOT try the oysters.
Maybe I just ordered the wrong dishes here but I would not come here to try the panroast.
This place is WAY overpriced compared to the oyster bar at palace station which is much better.

Delicious!

We've been here before and they never disappoint.
We make sure to sit at the counter and always have a great time.
This time we had grilled oysters, they were awesome.
The seared tuna salad was superb (as well as being a large portion of very fresh ahi).
The clams were done in a wonderful sauce.
Toss in 2 great drinks and we're very happy with this place.
One of the very few reasons to go to Harrah's anymore.

Awesome.
Oyster heaven.

This was a really uncomfortable dinner mostly because it was my suggestion and everyone hated it.
Everything my mother-in-law ordered was sold out.
They refused to bring her anything to drink despite multiple requests... the list is endless.
At the end of the day, the food that was available was good but the ambiance and the service were lacking.

No joke, I would eat here every night if I could.
We had a gift certificate so we ordered everything the chef recommended....quite literally.
There was also a nice couple next to us that gave suggestions however I have a feeling this is one of those places that no matter what you order is amazing.
You literally sit on the periphery of the kitchen so you watch all the lovely bumbling pots of shrimp, clams, oysters and the sizzling of steaks sets the stage for the cacophony of kitchen sounds.
The experience on a whole was a delight of the senses.
We started with Oyster Royale- the oysters tasted very fresh and I loved the wasabi roe and cream, the oysters were briney and fresh, some of the best I think I've had in a while ( I LOVE oysters!
), then we had a cold seafood platter that was chocked full of tiger prawns, crab legs, lobster tail, and more OYSTERS!, the hubs got a steak (because he is a beef junky) which was cooked rare to his liking and I got a muscle pot of gold...I can't exactly remember what the name was but it had a roasted tomato sauce that was superb.
I started with a bloody mary and then I had a martini sooooo yes remembering what I ate past the oysters is a bit hard, but eh it's Vegas Baby.
Writing this review makes me want to plan a trip specifically so I can eat oysters again.
If you are a fan of "in kitchen dining" and like oysters you should try this place for sure.
I am a very picky seafood eater, and have had oysters so fresh I've pulled a live baby crab from my mouth (oyster's last meal) so I know fresh seafood when I eat it.

Great prices for fresh oysters and also the peel and eat shrimp.
The main courses were OK.
I was confused by mine, scallops with Cajun cream sauce and tagliatelle  pasta.
It had 4 wonderful large fresh scallops on top but the it had a hand full of frozen baby scallops mixed into the pasta and sauce.
My wife had a salmon dish which was OK but nothing to write home about.
If we go back it will be to have oysters and shrimp but not much else.
Service was questionable to be nice.

We stop here several times whenever we're in town.
Great location, just right inside Harrah's, which is nice when we stay across the street.
They fly their oysters in that morning, so always fresh!
Their clam chowder is amazing!
This last time we were there they had afternoon drink specials, 2 for 1.
The staff is always friendly and helpful.
Sit at the bar, and you can watch them prepare everything, and chat with interesting folk!

I've had two completely different experiences at this place.
FIRST experience- the Hispanic waiter was rude.
It seems as though he hates his job!
Lol.
I think he is also the cook for the panroast too.
Anyways, it took him forever to get our water.
The clam chowder also looked strange.... more pink than white.
We ordered a dozen oysters as well and those were delicious.
SECOND experience- our waiter was Asian this time.
Very prompt on our order and water.
I tried the Caesar Salad this time and it was yummy.
The clam chowder tasted A LOT better this time around- white, creamy, full of clams.
The waiter also talked to us and recommended the Kusshi oyster and actually let us sample two different kinds of oysters.
Needless to say, we ordered an extra dozen Kusshi oysters.
Friendly service and samples= happy customers who order more food.

This place is the worst.
Low grade dog food.

A lot of people go to Vegas for the buffets.
After dining here, screw the buffets!
This was hands down, the best restaurant my lovely friends and I ate at during the fun weekend.
I felt as though you cannot go wrong with any food items you choose.
Each dish comes with a special sauce (I am a sauce man) that just enhances every flavor you get.
The panroast was amazing.
The shrimp was huge (Good idea to dip it in the panroast sauce since the shrimp can be a little dry)!
The oysters were sized right (Careful on the wasabi-like dip).
What really did me in was the seafood risotto.
I do not usually prefer risotto, but they definitely did something with this dish that got me hooked.
The texture was perfect, the sauce was perfect, everything was just so delicious.
Each bite was something to savor, being drunk or not.

Not sure how to describe my dining experience, the food was underwhelming  to be generous.
I was expecting more, the service was adequate.
It was nothing to write home about.
One member of our party received his order at least twenty minutes after everyone else.
To make situation worse, his order was not prepared well.
I doubt I will visit this establishment again, I should have read these reviews prior to attending.

I never liked oysters until I ate the oysters here at Harrah's!
Omg so amazing!
Open late too!

Who knew Harrah's would hide such a great place to eat??
Came here after looking on yelp for 'best rated' and 'open now'... was better than expected!
Sat at the bar.
Our server (Danny?
) was on top of it!
Quick, attentive, definitely handling the fully seated bar.
Got a dozen oysters for $24, same price you'd pay at a farmers market, and they were delicious!
Also had the ceviche, also good.
Tried the blue lagoon cocktail.
Tasty all around!
Def recommend.

A little gem tucked away in the middle of Harrah's.
The clam chowder is delicious.
The oysters always great!
Don't miss it!

We came here thinking that it was going to be like the Oyster Bar in Palace Station and we could save the drive+wait over there.
Sadly, we were wrong.
The menu selection was much smaller than the other Oyster Bar, but they had a few similar items so we figured it would still work.
At first, the server was very friendly and attentive.
He got our drink orders right away and suggested a few items on the menu to help us decide what to order.
My dad ordered the cioppino, my sister & sales guy got the recommended shrimp scampi, brother in law the fish and chips, and I had the Cajun scallops over pasta.
The cioppino was cold, which is odd since all the seafood in it was overcooked.
The shrimp scampi was super bland so the two people who ordered it were dumping salt and Tabasco on it just to make sure their taste buds were still working.
My scallops were seasoned well, but all caked and burnt on one side.
The pasta part of my dish was super bland too so I had to scrape the seasoning off of my scallops to mix in to get some type of flavor.
I think the fish and chips were ok, so that makes it the best dish of the night.
When the server came by, I told him that all the food was super bland and he just said "bland?
ok" then cleaned it up and gave us the bill.
In terms of price, it was pretty expensive too.
Mid $20 - mid $30 range but you save $1 with the Total Rewards card.
LOL.
What a joke.

DO NOT CONFUSE THIS PLACE with the Oyster Bar at Palace Station- completely different.
Somehow GPS led us here instead of the other one we really wanted to go to- I mean it wasn't bad- but when you were expecting a pan roast with creamy sauce and instead you get a jambalaya looking thing you are a little bummed.
Their version of pan roast is completely different and it wasn't until the food came out that I realized we were at the wrong place!
No wonder there was no line!
However, I must admit I really liked how they sliced the lobster pieces in half so it was easy to eat.

This is a review purely on oysters cause that's what I got.
The oysters that I got was $20 -$25 for a dozen including tax and tip.
I sat by the bar where we got to see the staff opening the oysters up.
It was pretty pricy but wasn't a surprised since we were in the middle of the dessert so it is probably hard to get seafood out there.
Anyways I was extremely surprised by how fresh the oysters tasted and no sand!!
I'm not exactly sure what the different oysters were because we got a mixed but I enjoyed them all.
My friend ordered Manhattan Clam Chowder and did not enjoy it very much.
It was red/orange and looked like a tomato soup.
She actually said it tasted more tomato than clam chowder.
The restaurant is pretty small, the kitchen is right in front of you.
If you sit by the bar you watch then make everyone else's dish.
I guess this is why some of the other food isn't as amazing like some people were expecting because I don't think they had a specialize chef for some of the food.
I saw like some guy who looked like the manager and other stuff help cook the food.

My fiancee decided to try this place since my cousin was raving about it.
Since we were staying across the street at Caesar's Palace, we decided to take a stroll for a quick bite.
Once seated at the bar, it took some time before anyone walking around stopped to give us any attention.
We ordered a dozen oysters and the pan roast.
The oysters appeared fresh and were nice and cold.
The pan roast was ok, not as tasty as the pan roast served at the Oyster Bar at Palace Station.
Not sure if service was lagging because we got there about 40 minutes before closing, but the server just didn't seem interested in their job and we ended up giving up on ordering another drink during the meal.
If you're looking for an Oyster Bar, try the one at Palace Station.
This one doesn't seem quite up to par.

Came here for oysters on the half shell.
Sampled a couple different kinds, like the pico de gallo and wasabi/ creme freche.
After eating half a dozen of each, decided they were not what we wanted and sent the remaining half dozen back for plain oysters.
Amazingly, Matt, our server, gladly helped us out and hooked us up with a new plate of oysters, and we only paid for what we ate.
Fantastic!
Matt was wonderful and I highly recommend him.
Great place for oysters on the half shell.

The clam chowder was alright, the waitstaff was super fast, though it wasn't very busy, but the oysters we got in the half shell could have been better...
They weren't briny enough.
We also got one of the seafood entrees, it was mediocre as well.
The closest bathroom is a trek away .
Overall, it was alright.
Wouldn't eat there again, but it wasn't terrible.

I had the clam chowder and a dozen oysters.
The chowder was very creamy and thick.. it almost had the texture of a potato soup.
The bar seats around 25 or so people and there are a few tables.
There a good selection of dishes.
The oysters were sweet, but on the smallish side.

I cannot explain how delicious this place is.
First of all THE BEST crab cakes!
EVER!!!
You have to get these.
They are worth every penny!
The fish and chips and calamari are excellent too.
Everything is extremely fresh and so good.
Not only is the food amazing, but the service is equivalent.
Our server was Moon, who was such a sweet, nice guy.
He went above and beyond to get us everything we needed, and no need to ask for refills (which can sometimes be annoying); the minute our drinks were low, he was on top of it with another.
If you eat here, please make sure to tip this guy good, he totally deserves it.
Last but not least, the restaurant itself is extremely cute and cozy, there is no other way to put it.
We've only eaten here once (we live in LA), but we will definitely be going there again next time we are in Vegas.

YUM YUM YUM!
I'm from New Orleans and seafood was excellent !!!!
I'm a seafood snob and loved it!
It was pretty neat to sit at the bar and watch cooks make your meal for you!

We come here every time we go to Las Vegas, which is once or twice a year.
The raw oysters are always fresh and worth the price.
Our favorite dish is the pan roast.
It's filled with fresh seafood and perfectly seasoned.
One time we went to the Oyster bar at Palace Station, only to find that kids are not allowed as it's a bar type of place, so we can't compare these 2 places.
This place allows kids, but being in the middle of a casino, the air quality is not very good (ie, cigarette smell).

Worst service I ever had in Vegas.
Waiter is rude and we waited more than half hour to even get the water.
The steak we ordered was midium but had a well done steak which is disgusting!
Will never come back.
EVER!

OYSTAAA BARRR  Check it this place is hidden in a secret ghetto part of Las Vegas in a Hotel called Harrahs.
First things first if your broke you wont be able to pay!
Oysters range from about 20-30 dollars!
but I have to say.. ITS SUPER DELICIOUS NO JOKE!
Ofcourse just with oyster you wont fill yourself up but they actually give you free bread and chips which does the job!
The people working their tend to watch sports game on T.V.
so they tend to forget about their customers so you have to speak loudly to them to get their attention...  - 1 star for that.
Overall though if you just want some oysters this place does the job!
PEACE

They wouldn't let me order take out last night.
Boo.
I've done it last year and the year before.

Hey this place rocks!
Richard took care of us.
The raw bar was fantasti please give it a try.you will not be disappointe

Its a must have every time I go to vegas.
Beer boiled shrimp,  grilled oysters, raw oysters and Bloody Mary oyster shooters are all on my must order list.
If you feel like steak, it great there too!

Every time I come to Vegas (which is frequently for work) I always try and find the out of the way the little hot spot the locals go.
However...
I make it a point at least once each time to hit this place.
The staff/chefs are always fun and friendly!
(Dennis was great tonight).
The food is outstanding (and yes, I have a refined palette) for the price.
Tonight, Oysters Royale (never miss it) some blackened (for you NOLA folk not the same but great) shrimp and Pan Roast.
I've never been disappointed and never expect to be!
Skip Emil's.
This is the place for great food and company.

Oysters on the half shell, grilled oysters, oysters rock, clams, clam chowder, rib eye, split lobster tail.
Not one food complaint from our group.
The oysters were fantastic, the rib eye tender, the lobster succulent, clams were tasty.
Our only complaint was that we were seated, and never got service for 15 minutes until one of our party finally walked up to the bar and told them.
After that we were promptly served for the rest of our meal.
It would have been 5 stars for other than the service.
Note that this place is NOT cheap.
It's on average about 25$ for a dozen oysters.
You can certainly find them cheaper off the strip, and at various happy hours around the area, but we wanted a place we could walk to from where we were staying.
Our party of 5 racked up a 202$ bill for food and drinks w/o tip.
Some times ya just gotta splurge!
We went here the first day of a 4 day stay and I dreamed about these oysters the last 3 nights.
Yes they were that good, and I've had oysters from WA to CA to FL to ME.
These stand up to any I've ever had.

Went outside my comfort zone and ordered bbq oysters and the Rockefeller oysters...both awesome but favored the bbq ones.. calamari was good not chewy.....my waiter was an older gentleman(James) and he was awesome also...most definitly coming back...

II ordered the manhattan clam chowder one day for lunch and the next day ordered a crab louis salad.
the food was great.
I was in and out fast and back to my convention.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.
My husband and I searched the strip for some raw oysters and found some at Spago that cost us $25 for half a dozen and they were small and the sauce that came with it tasted like vinegar.
WE were majorly disappointed.
Well we left there and went to walk down the strip and found this little hidden GEM in Harrah's.
The calamari was the best I have ever had and the raw oysters on the half shell were large and came with the cocktail sauce and horseradish that makes them so good.
Great cocktails to boot.
My next trip this will be a regular spot for my meals.

I came here two days ago on accident.
A friend of mine suggested I go to the Oyster Bar, but failed to mention that it was the one at the Palace Station hotel.
I accidentally navigated myself here, but it was the best mistake I could've made.
I ordered the pan roast because that was what my friend suggested to me, thinking it was at the other restaurant, so I did.
They served it to me in a giant metal bowl that looked like half a mini torpedo.
It was kinda cool.
The pan roast comes with a variety of fresh, well cooked seafood that was absolutely delicious.
It was served in this yellowish curry that stole the show.
I could not stop eating and tasting it.
I was tempted to take a dish  home with me, but at $31 I decided to save it for some gambling.
Service was good.
Although I did have to wait a whole after my meal for the waiter to come by and ask if I needed anything else, which I did.
Overall good experience though.
I would consider staying at Harrah's just so I can eat here.
Plus it's open 24/7.
Awesome!

The Food gets a 5 the service gets a generous 2.
Oysters were awesome as were the king crab legs.
The service was comically bad.
Was not rude or anything like that, was just the classic Houdini service.
Order and watch them disappear.
Basically had to wave my arms like landing an airplane to pay the bill.
But food definitely makes it worthwhile just make sure to go there when in a carefree mood

Ok so me and the wife came in here for a dozen oysters, they were delish.
Since the oysters were so good we tryed the New England clam chowder that was awesome to.
I looked over and the lady next to use had A huge dish of seafood with a cream sauce at the bottom and convinced us to try it.
It's called Pan Roast OMG so good.
I'm from Florida and I know seafood this is good seafood!!!
But I think what mAde it so fun and a all around good expierence was our server Trent.
Ask for his section.
He's was at the oyster bar area when we were there.

If you've ever had a pan roast from Grand Central Station in NYC, you'll know this is a ketchup nightmare... it's so not right.
Horrible frozen ingredients mixed up with industrial grade HFC laden ketchup.
NO BUENO...

Great friendly staff!
Especially the server Moon, the dude from Korea!
The food is so fricken' salty though my god I'm dying from salty mouth as a write this!!
I still have a full table of salty food to eat and  I'm not excited to eat it!
The oyster shooters are good though!

I love this place!
Every time I come to Vegas I have to stop by here and get the grilled Parmesan and garlic oysters - the best I've ever had.
And the flash fried calamari is awesome (abnormally large pieces) especially since it's only an appetizer.
Plus the service is great and the environment is casual so it's much easier to be in and out and back to partying it up on the strip!

The server/ oyster shucker seemed annoyed to be disturbed from his sports game on TV by me ordering or requesting items like napkins, silverware, water, or the check.
Come to think of it the guy needed prompting the whole time!
For food that ain't cheap this kind of service is cray...
Especially with the wealth of good dining options in Vegas.
Run away from this place.
They suck!
My bacon-wrapped scallops were gross- covered in BBQ and the white fatty part of bacon, not the standard solid minutely fatty looking pieces real restaurants serve.
I love seafood whether it be fine dining or dive style.
This place sucked by all standards and the service was exceptionally poor.

We had read the reviews and decided to try The Oyster Bar for dinner one night.
So glad we did!!
This little seafood jewel is tucked away in a small section of Harrah's Casino.
We sat at the bar and watched them shuck the oysters and prepare our meals!
My husband and I both had "kettle" cooked items - he had the seafood bouillabaisse and I had the seafood risotto.
Both were excellent choices.
The bouillabaisse was like a seafood "treasure hunt" - it had a nice sized lobster tail, huge shrimp, mussels and fresh fish in a wonderful stock - it seemed as if you could put your spoon in the bowl and bring up something new each time!!
The risotto was cooked to perfection as we watched and tasted amazing.
Again, an assortment of fresh seafood throughout the entire bowl.
Our server, Trent, was also the cook and he was highly entertaining and extremely attentive.
Very fresh oysters and assorted seafood served in a surprising, casual atmosphere made this one of our new LV favorites!

This place was great, we went with our close friends and had a blast.
The variety of oysters were great and the calamari wonderful.
Love the flatbread and wonderful bloody Mary's.
Will visit this place again when in Vegas!

I failed at my first attempt to eat here, arriving at about 10:37pm after a gambling run.
On my second attempt, I was more successful.
I ponied up to this little bar and restaurant and got a jumbo shrimp cocktail.
My friends were about to take things to the next level and I had very little in my stomach, so this pit stop was very necessary.
The shrimp were big and flavorful as was the accompanying sauce.
The complimentary rolls and butter were taken advantage of given the fact that this is an in-casino restaurant which - much like everywhere else in Las Vegas - was kinda overpriced.
If you have a Total Rewards card from the Harrah's group, use it to get a slight discount here.
I did not experience much of the menu, but what I did experience I liked very much.
If you like oysters and other seafood, it appeared as if my co-patrons were very much enjoying what they were eating.

This place was good and I stop by while on business in town.
The varieties of oysters were great and the Bass was good.
Service was a little slow and need more work.

Maybe I ordered the wrong thing (spicy linguini w/ shrimp), but my friends had never tried the Oyster Bar at Palace Station's Pan Roast, so we tried it here.
It is not even CLOSE.
I had a feeling it wouldn't be up to par with the original.
It had a lot of seafood, but the consistency was very watery and a bit too sweet.
I got the calamari, which had way too much breading on it and was on the salty side.
My other friend got the linguini w/ clams, which was not a very large portion considering the near $20 price (more or less).
There's no wait but skip the Pan Roast here!

If only I could give 6 or more stars...
Without question, this was the best overall restaurant I went to while we were in vegas last week...
In fact We went twice... First... Best oysters Ive had...bar none.
Period.
Freshest, overnighted daily.
Chef knows everything about his oysters and can supply you with more facts about them than you know existed.The naked cowboy and naked cowgirl oysters (yes, these are the actual names) are a branded oyster that will soon be instantly recognized by millions of oyster fans coast to coast.
And the chef prepares them perfectly..
While there I also tried their new england clam chowder..
Barely any potatoes... Its all clam and again..
The best Ive had.
Chef Raymondo also served us up "oyster shots", some with bloody mary mix, some with a combination fat tire beer, cocktail sauce, and an oyster.
That was my first time on a shot like that... And wow!
Incredible!
Chey Raymondo also prepared a grilled shrimp and pepper dish that was amazing.
I also must specifically call out Chef Raymondo as literally the best, friendliest, most charismatic chef slash server ever (when you sit at the oyster bar the Chef also serves).
When i went back the next day for lunch, Chef remembered I like Fat Tire and came right over with a 6 pack chilled on ince in a bucket.
Every time I am in vegas now I will stop at harrahs oyster bar...
Multiple times!
Harrahs: great job on having the bar and whatever you do: keep Raymondo on your staff and happy.

Had the kuushi and kumamoto oysters last week and they were not fresh.
It's getting late in the season, so that could be why.
The oyster meat was flat and not plump and  it did not have the salty ocean flavor.
Had the seared tuna salad, now, that was excellent.
The portion was great for one person.
However, if ordering an main dish, this salad would be enough for two.
The service was fairly slow, as I sat at the bar and I may have been transparent that night, because had I not waved at the bar guy I may not have been served.
Once, I ordered the food came real quick.
First time eating there, the experience was ok.

I'm sure people walk by and don't give this place a second glance.
They are so wrong!!
The horseradish burns your face off in such a good way!
Shooters are awesome.
We had the cioppino and o.b's pan roast both fantastic!!!
The shooters are big, they will get a good buzz!
Carlos was great he was busy but still gave us great service.

I've never had a bad experience or service here.
I love their oysters on the half shell.
So fresh and they do a pretty good job shucking the oysters so that there's rarely shell pieces on the oyster.
I've been here so many times now but my favorite item on the menu that I recently tried is the cioppino.
Hands down an amazing dish.
Filled with tons of a variety of seafood (mussel, clam, lobster, shrimp, scallop, etc), and a fragrant spicy tomato based broth.
My family ordered the OB pan roast, the sauce taste a lot like mesquite bbq sauce.
Sweet and Salty but full of seafood as well.
Overall everything was good, service friendly and attentive, I'd come back on my next trip!

Good food & great service.
Went to Oyster Bar Friday Night & Saturday Night, food was really good and excellent service.
5 star!

This place was aight.
Not that fancy and I somehow confused it with another oyster bar at The Palace Station, so I was deeply disappointed when I found out they were two different places.
Considering I was staying at the Harrah's and I needed a quick bite before heading out for the night, this was a close option without going too ham.
I order a half dozen oyster with wasabi caviar and a clam chowder.
I guess I wasn't that hungry so this was enough to fill me up.
Thankfully, they do offer a basket of bread and sesame chip/cracker thing...a lot of it.
The oysters were whatevs.
The oyster themselves were fresh and a little bit briny since they were medium sized, but I thought the creme fraiche and a huge dollop of wasabi caviar was a bit excessive.
I had to scoop most of it off and just douse it with a lot of lemon juice.
The creme fraiche was so thick and creamy and the wasabi caviar, tasteless.
It didn't have that kick of spicy I was expecting.
It would have been better if it was just wasabi creme served on the side.
Clam chowder was your typical run of the mill bowl of clam chowder.
Nothing to write home about.
Also, if you have a Total Rewards card, there will be some discounts for you!
A couple dollars off for most of the menu so I can't say everything was bad.

After our EDC trip, my boyfriend and I did not feel like eating anything.
We wanted something small but nothing too heavy and filling.
Not sure if it is a good idea to eat raw food after a day of not eating and a night of drinking, but we wanted oysters.
As we walked up to the counter, we can smell the fishiness of the oysters.
It was around 1pm and we were expecting a lot of people, but there were only about 4-5 families around us.
We sat at the bar; right in front of where the chef would pry open the shells.
At first, we stood in front of the bar, waiting for a waiter or someone to help us.
We ended up getting fed up, so we just sat down.
Nobody came to neither take our order nor offer us anything to drink.
After 10 minutes, I started too waved down one of the chefs and he finally took our order.
We ordered the half dozen Salsa half shelled oysters for $18.
All I can say is, not worth it!
I rather go to boiling crab, even though it is not as fresh the one here.
But honestly, it tasted the same.
Yes, the oysters were fresh and the salsa made it extra flavorful and it did take away the fish stench.
But for $18, I was expecting a POW in my mouth.
Nothing happened.
Lame... We downed everything within 5 minutes...took another 10 to wave down someone to get us our checks.
Bam $21 total...and we booked.
Next time, if I do come back, I would probably just order some clam chowder or calamari.... (the family next to us ordered them and they looked and smelled good)

I've been to vegas so many times, yet I barely discovered this restaurant last year.
I absolutely adore this place.
My boyfriend and I normally just order oysters.
But when we were there last night, we ordered the Pico del oysters with the Catch of the Day: Chilean Sea Bass.
There is complimentary crunchy flat bread.
Be careful don't get full off that though.
Servers are extremely nice and so are the cooks.
We had chatted with one of the cooks our first time there and asked when they receive their shipment of oysters and other seafood.
He said they come in fresh every morning.
No wonder it tastes so fresh !
A+ !

Since trying the pan roast at Palace Station, my husband and I seek out other pan roast restaurants to get our "fix" and to compare.
We were staying on the strip and I noticed Harrah's had a restaurant of the same name so we decided to try it.
Yes it is more expensive than the one at Palace Station but it's packed with seafood.
My husband liked it so much he wanted to go back the next day.
We went there late so there was no line, they have regular tables too for those who don't like to sit at the bar type tables/chairs.
There was an additional discount if you went back within 24 hours.
In any event, the menu has a lot more items than the one at Palace Station.
Since starting this review, I've been back to the restaurant once more, still very good.
I also tried to go back to Palace Station- waited an hour and got out of line because I couldn't take it anymore so ...maybe we're going to just stick with Harrah's from now on.

everytime we go we get some oysters and oyster shooters in between doing other things.
asian bomb is the way to go.
intense but fantastic.
the guys there are a lot of fun too.

Love the seafood here, fresh and tasty.
Our server Sammy was very attentive, made our 3 and 5 year old kids feel special

This is my favorite Vegas spot that not many people know about.
The food is excellent.
Fresh, light, and made right in front of you.
The oysters are fresh and tasty and I recommend the fish tacos, cioppino, both clam chowders, and the crabcakes.
But the real charm here is the amazing staff.
The same folks have been there for years and the recognize us when we come back, even after a year.
Treat them right and they will be exceptionally nice.
Last year we got a free risotto sample and this year it was shrimp ceviche and some soup.
Prices are reasonable for Vegas and service is prompt and friendly.
A great place for lunch and worth a walk.
