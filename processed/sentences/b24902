I would NOT recommend seeing Dr. Saunders ever for foot problems!l!!!
He spoke to us with sarcasm and very direct with his questions if he didn't get the answer he wanted.
He was not compassionate and showed very little emotion unless he was trying to sell you something like orthropedics for your shoes.
REALLY!?
Regardless of your age young or old as his patient you should be treated with respect and this didn't happen.
I will NEVER go back nor will any of my family.

Doctor Suykerbuyk provided absolutely top-notch care for my daughter who needed surgery, including a plate and screws.
We had no insurance and Dr. Suykerbuyk and his office not only gave us fair pricing, but negotiated on our behalf with the anesthesiologist and the surgery center!
Dr. Suykerbuyk has a wonderful, friendly bedside manner and put us at ease right away.
Dr. S. is also extremely confident and with good reason.
Our daughter healed faster that predicted and now has 100% use of her ankle.
The appointments were made quickly, the office advised us promptly of any changes, and we never waited more than 5 minutes to see Dr. S. on follow-up visits.
Very professional all-around.
Other practitioners would be smart to follow Metro Foot & Ankle's lead with regards to care, pricing, professionally-run offices/billing, and bedside manner!

Dr. Suykerbuyk was awesome and friendly and had gone to him for years for terrible ingrown toenails...
Unfortunately they kept coming back so I went to Dr Saunders.
He was so insulting and sarcastic and degraded me (being a brand new young nurse) His medical care was good, my toe healed but I will never go again because I was so insulted, and I am not a sensitive person.
He needs to learn professionalism.
