The Potterrow shop can be found within the University of Edinburgh's Potterrow building.
It is essentially for the use of the students, and comes with all of the student essentials - stationery, food and drink, newspapers and magazines, as well as a large range of university-branded gifts.
Some of the best things about this shops are its deals.
The student deals here are great - one example is the Â£3 meal deal that includes a sandwich, crisps and drink.
It tends to be the place where I get my stationery from, purely because of its convenient location in the heart of the university campus.
If you need a new biro, or fancy sporting some university clothing, then visit the Potterrow shop - more or less a one-stop shop.

Inside the glorious student union of Potterrow is the EUSA student shop.
This EUSA shop is the biggest of all EUSA shops and not surprisingly the most popular.
During term time, this shop is mobbed when lunch time comes along!
If you want to pick up a quick sandwich and a drink then Potterrow stores a vast range of sandwiches, wraps and ginsters pastries!
With great deals on every week, students can save a lot of money coming here for lunch rather than going somewhere else.
And what I love about it is that it must stock the biggest variety of flapjacks I have ever seen in a shop!
Apart from the food and drink, newspapers and a wide selection of stationary products are available, with great deals on pads of paper (essential for any eager student!).
If you're however, even eager to be the complete student then a wide range of Edinburgh University branded clothing is just waiting to be bought by you!
Come on, you know you want to buy that school scarf or Uni hoody!

I always get a bit freaked out when a shop just insists on trying to sell me University-logo things.
When I was hiring my gown for graduation, I found out we had a mascot.
And they were trying to sell me one.
And I didn't like it one bit.
Logo-things make me think of cults.They make me think of an unnecessary amount of pride.
I mean, yes, I'm happy I went to Edinburgh Uni, but I don't need a hoodie or other labeled things to demonstrate this.
They sell pretty much everything they have at the DHT Basement EUSA shop here.
Because they're both EUSA shops.
Except that the one in DHT isn't mobbed.
And that brings me great comfort.
The prices are the same as in the other shop.
Except that the DHT Basement one doesn't try selling me useless things with my university's name on it.
So, yes, if you're looking for paper and pens and all that kinda jazz, come here.
If you can't be bothered to swim through a student mob, then go to the basement shop.
If mobs bring you comfort, on the other hand...
