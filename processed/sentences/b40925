This Park is abut four and a half months old beautiful park in Peoria, Park has a shaded play area for the kids & shaded water park, Grass area shaded picnic and barbecue areas, it's a  great park also nice clean new restrooms, Parking lot is well lit at night.
Even the play area is well lit for the evening, It seems to get kind of busy in the late afternoons, Park also has a stage area so you can have a puppet show or whatever you want to do, I highly recommend to come and check out the park the city of Peoria has done very good job keeping this park nice and clean.
A fun place for families and children.

My kids loveeee this park!
I love that my kids don't leave all grubby and dirty!
They got clean functional restrooms, shaded playground equipment, big spacious ramadas and a big pond to walk around.

Love the family atmosphere with the dogs and the ducks picnicking all together...well, sort of

This park has everything!
There is a nice little lake for fishing that has a fountain  in the middle.
The playground is covered for shade, and there are tree basic areas to it.
One area is for kids between 2 and 5, another is for 5 to 8, and there is an area for bigger kids as well.
They have a large baseball field area with multiple  fields.
This park also has large open grass area so kids can just run around as well.
The highlight of this park is their splash pad area!
It is a really cool set up and a larger then normal area for the kids to play.
Bring a towel and try to joy the Arizona summer.
Good job City of Peoria.
