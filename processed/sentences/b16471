Thank you for the mini peanut butter cupcake, babe.
We ventured out to The Venetian so that I can see the hotels and because my beloved Bouchon Bakery is located here.
After I bought a pack of mini macaroons from Bouchon and put the entire chocolate macaroon in my mouth, to my right there stands yet another bakery and of course, we had to make a stop.
Since I just ate 300 calories about a few seconds ago, I opted for the mini peanut butter cupcake.
He got a rum ball for himself and a tiramisu cupcake for his brother (forgot if it's the regular sized one or the mini one); the 3 of us were pretty satisfied w/ our selections.
The cake part is soft and moist and the frosting isn't too sweet although I wish it was richer.
Truffles and cupcakes galore.. this place has it all!

We had stopped by Bouchon Bakery, and right around the corner is this little hidden gem.
Located right off the elevator next to Grand Lux Cafe.
Just like the previous review, I had just purchased a couple hundred calories, but as we walked by we noticed these beautiful candied apples.
Almost too pretty to eat.
Along with apples, they had cupcakes, chocolate dipped pretzels, toffee, and many more treats.
I went with a milk chocolate/carmel covered pretzel and a pistachio chocolate square.
Both were good.
