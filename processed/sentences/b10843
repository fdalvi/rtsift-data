I went to Vegas and had a  reservation here and eventhough I pre paid thru Car Rentals.com, the wait was insane, when we got to the counter the rep said we were lucky usually the wait per him, is about 2 hours!!!
Make plans.
The car we got was alright, I rather have a nicer car and eventhough we hinted we ended up with the Ford Focus, oh heck who cares, jsut get me out of this airport!!!!!!!!!!!

Everything worked as planned.
Got the red car I needed and it went vroom.
Had about 18k miles on it so practically brand new.
Satellite radio a challenge if you are not familiar with it.
Took me awhile to find a good station.

Terribly long wait.
It's like they didn't know that anyone was coming to Las Vegas today.
They seemed to have more employees than people waiting in line as they were doing a shift change that took about 1 hour.
Someone else commented that it was like the Post Office and they were exactly right.
They just don't give a damn.
Rent somewhere else no matter how much it costs!

Ridiculously long waits,  not enough staff.
Waste an hour or more of your stay in Vegas.
Cars not the newest.
Only good thing is the price.
Staff try hard,  just not enough of them
