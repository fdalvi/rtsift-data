This is the BEST yarn shop I have been to in a LONG time!!!
The staff are AMAZING (Elizabeth and Terry where there that day) and were so kind and helpful.
I was visiting from out of state, and try to hit local yarn shops when I travel.
The selection was really nice, but honestly the Elizabeth made the experience top notch!
She showed me cute new patterns I would not have thought of and we bonded over patterns we had in our Ravelry library!
I LOVE this store and will for sure come back!

The staff are very knowledgeable and helpful.
They carry much better quality of yarn and supplies than the chain stores but the cost is higher, too.
They have classes and will help you if you take a project in you are working on.
I think they have knitting groups as well.
Oh, and I love stores with especially good lighting, natural or other!
My poor old eyes need all the help they can get!
Be sure to look around at all the pretty samples to inspire you!
