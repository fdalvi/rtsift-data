Best PTs in my opinion.
They have beer pong tables and pool tables.
It's close to UNLV so there usually a big crowd after games or on the weekends.
I usually go with a big group and drink through happy hour.
My favorite thing is there selections.
They have the pear cider and it's the BOMB.
Usually the bartenders and really cool, they get a little busy so you gotta be patient.

Visited the PT's on Tropicana two nights in a row during my recent Vegas misadventures.
Really enjoyed the huge mugs of Stone IPA, the tasty food from chef Sonia Lima -- and most of all the outstanding service from bartender Liz Brainard.
I'll be back!
