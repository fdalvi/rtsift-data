I was totally impressed by the owner (Rigo)'s enthusiasm and service.
He makes the sandwiches taste better just by the way he makes you laugh!
I have since referred at least a dozen of my friends to eat there, and I recommend you give it a try too!

It's a fair place but I wouldn't go out of my way.
The portions are kinda small for the price & the food is mediocre.
Not that you can expect too much from a chain, strip-mall style place.
It'll do in a pinch but I'f recommend to try Corleones or Uncle Sams instead.

I was so happy to see a Charleys pop up in Arizona!
For some reason we're like the only state that doesn't utilize this amazing quick restaurant.
The thing about Charleys is that it's always been kind of expensive but the fries alone are worth it!
This location seems to be a classic case of lost in translation.
Their fries aren't nearly as good as any other Charleys that I've ever been to and their sandwiches can't even compare.
The service is really fast compared to other locations because it's pretty much a ghosttown.
Someday I'll get a great Charleys experience without leaving the comfort of my home.
Someday :{

I was hoping for finally a good Philly but didn't find it here.
They have the meat correct with exception of its quality.
The bread seemed old and tasted stale.
Finally their fries were a disappointment.
I recall going to a Charley's in a mall and they were awesome!
Unfortunately, that wasn't the case here :-(

My husband and I went there for our first time today.
What a mistake.
First of all, the ladies bathroom had no soap or paper towels to wash/dry your hands.
My husband had the steak sandwich and I had the chicken ranch.
There was so little meat on the sandwiches that we were perplexed when we were finished.
The inside trash was overflowing.
I have been sick to my stomach the last hour....never again.

Amazing as always.
The classic philly cheessteak will never let you down.
Fast service, great food!
