There really aren't enough stars for Dr. Sudha and I can't believe there were no reviews raving about her services.
She just got a brand new practice so the address isn't accurate.
The phone number didn't change.
But she's always made it a point to see us and not "passed us off to the NP".
If your pediatrician doesn't feel like a member of your family ... you may want to give Gateway Pediatrics a call.

Dr. Sudha has been my toddler's doc since birth and I can't say enough about Dr. Sudha and her staff.
Everyone is great and they remember all the children by first name that come in!
Not only that, Dr. Sudha understands the human aspect of patient care because she's so affectionate with her patients, something that I truly love and appreciate!
In addition, most pediatric offices are decorated with child characters or animals, but Dr. Sudha's nicely decorated office has pictures of real children with disabilities on her wall.
What a great way to display the diverse world of children that surround us!
I highly recommend her practice to new or existing parents looking for a pediatric office!

Let me first say I love Dr Sudah!
Love her!
She is the bee knees of pediatricians.
Beautiful offices as well, oh!
And her lactation specialist Paulie is a rock star!
On the other side of the coin, I have seen two NPs who are not warm, not caring, not friendly, in truth I'm not sure why these two specific women are care givers.
At least after you jab my son in the thigh with a flu shot ask if I have any questions and please do not treat me like I am an idiot when I do corner you to get answers to my questions.
I know these women are busy and I'm sure they see a billion overly concerned parents a day but it concerns what's is most precious to us (our children) so please have the decency to pretend like these aren't stupid (to you) questions.
Again, I love the Dr. and would recommend her to anyone with kids but I just don't get the warm fuzzy feeling from some of her staff.
