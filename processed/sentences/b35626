This is the neighbourhood bar in the Alpine area of Kitchener.
We were here to celebrate a family member's impending nuptials and I am certainly glad I came to Chicago.
The food (I had some chicken wings) was good and there were lots of pool tables to play on.
The beer was cold and there are big screens to watch the game all over and the service was attentive... what more can you ask for in such and establishment?
We all had a great time, and hope to be back soon!

If you were a costumer there, and you weren't order any drinks, after many times you come, they gonna make you wait a long time to get a table or they will not give you any!
DISLIKE

Went here to meet friends for pool , beer, and pub fair.
The food is lacking , wings are ok but there is a real lack of choice for flavors.
Stay away from the poutin its bland cheese with under cooked fries and salty beef gravy.
The girl bartender is great, the waitreses are slow and unatentive.
I am not in a hurry to go back.
Will try other places before going here again.

Sports bar atmosphere with hot waitresses .
the pool tables are busy on the weekend and during the week the prices are way too high at night for a table.
The food and beer are OK.
The only time worth going is during the day on weekdays cheap pool
