A couple of weeks ago, my friends from uni came back up to Edinburgh and we ordered a take away from here, before heading out for a night on the town and we all agreed that Delhi Diner offers a great selection of food and is very tasty.
Even my vegetarian friend was able to find he had a good selection to choose from.
The food we ordered came very quick, although it was a Thursday night, and I'm sure the chefs wouldn't have been inundated with orders.
I ordered a couple of papadums and a chicken Korma, although I normally go for something hot, I hadn't had a korma in a while and was pleasantly surprised at how flavoursome this one was.
I ordered a plain naan to accompany my meal and this was good too, not too greasy unlike other restaurants that I have been to.
The price for all of this was around Â£13, which is about average, so considering the portions you get and the quality, I would definitely order again from here.

Mixed experiences I'm afraid.
Food is good and was particularly impressed when I ate in, however takeaways take forever to arrive and even when I've collected seem to take far too long (my guess is they forgot my order until I turned up).
Recently undergone a facelift so would be interested to see if anything else has changed.

I've recently been back to the Delhi Diner and it was really good.
The service was attentive without being intrusive, the food was delicious and they have big bottles of Cobra beer!
What else could you ask for???
Definitely will go back.
