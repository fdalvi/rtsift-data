Good selection of snacks.
Convenient gas stop right next to my better half's work.

Please just be prepared to wait.
99% of the time they only have 1 cashier in the morning and you will be waiting in line.
Staff is super duper diddly friendly.The store is very organized.

Not much you can really review about a gas station.
However, I must say that I was impressed that they had my change ready for me after I was done pumping.
I didn't even have to ask.
So yes, I like this place.
I will return.

I stop here at least three times a week on my way home from work, for all kinds of random stuff.
I do not buy gas here (wayyyy to expensive), but the two guys I always see behind the counter are awesome !!!!
Fun, nice sweet and remember me.
I love that type of customer service.
Here is what I don't like, though, I always go in there and the clerks know me by name I have to snow them my ID EVERY TIME I buy an adult beverage.
It's so annoying, first off I'm 33 years old(shhh dont tell), second sometimes I don't want to lug my whole purse or wallet in, I just wanna jump out right quick and get whatever and be on my way.
This rule of every person every time is annoying!!!!
It needs to change, like I don't have time for it and I understand its a rule but come on now!!!
My age and birthrate are not gonna change in 24 hours.
If this changes its 5 star central for this convenience store!!
