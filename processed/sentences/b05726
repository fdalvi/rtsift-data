2 years in and I still love these guys...prompt, admit when and if a mistake was made (just one so far) and just plain good folks.
Highly Recommend!

Super friendly and great service - took 3 vintage Hawaiian shirts to be laundered & 1 to be pressed and it was just over $10...most excellent!

I have been coming here for the last month since the good dry cleaner by my house shut down.
This place is inexpensive and does a fine job.
Today I dropped off:  two dress shirts; and  one pair of pants.
Total for dry cleaning $9.50.
They will be ready Monday afternoon, this is typical of this dry cleaner's 3 day turnover rate.
When you receive your shirts they are neatly pressed with a plastic tab attached to the crossed arms.
No complaints!

Friendly, quick & great service.
Smiling faces & excellent work will get 5 stars from me every time!
