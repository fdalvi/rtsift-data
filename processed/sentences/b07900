Bernie's cracks me up.
If you call the number you reach the barber shop next door.
Bernie's doesn't have a phone but the barber shop can tell you their hours of operation.
I've taken my car there twice now, it is a hand wash spot and it has a little Mexican restaurant inside.
I haven't tried the food, so the review is just on my carwash.
First time they did a great job, except for when I left all the windows streaked with water because they didn't dry it enough.
Second time they also did a great job, but they took over an hour and I was the only car there.
Also, both times the sign I read said $11.99 for the wash, yet I was charged $14.99..
I tried to explain this in my best spanglish but the lady ringing me up just kept asking if I wanted a taco..
So all in all this carwash isn't too bad (if time and money aren't an issue).
Maybe next time I'll try the taco.

These guys do a great job for $10.
This is the only place you can pull up get you car washed, get your hair cut, and eat a burrito, all in the same place.
You will pull out FLOSS'N in you shinny car, full stomach and fresh hair cut.
The $10 car wash comes with interior cleaning and vacuum, car scent, and tire wet.
Great deal!
Update!
the prices are not longer $10, I had my car washed a couple of weeks ago and the prices have risen to like $15, still a good wash and shine for the price.

Its really a 4 in 1 spot!
It has a barbershop, mexican food restaurant, auto detailer and carwash!
Truly a one stop shop, lol.
The car washes are always on point.
They shine my rims amazingly, clean the glass inside & out very well and its all done by HAND!
The little mexican spot inside has really good food to snack on while you kill time waiting for your car to be washed.
Ive never used the barbershop or detailer yet but the place always has customers so perhaps they know what they're doing.
