The Scottsdale School of Rock has been the best thing that has ever happened to my kids.
Megan and Shane who run the school (along with all of the other teachers and staff) love the kids and treat them as if they were their own.
My boys are gaining confidence, and learning musical accountability, how to be a team player, responsibility, music appreciation, stage presence, and how to actually play an instrument in a rock band!!!
I have nothing but great things to say about this school, its staff, its teaching methods, and the sense of community.
My kids run home to practice to be prepared for their next rehearsals.

I cannot speak highly enough about School of Rock.
The individual teachers are excellent and, more importantly, they have a character and professionalism that instills complete confidence.
Because their focus is not just on learning your instrument but in learning how to perform within a group, each student's confidence level soars.
It is amazing to watch.

The concept of SOR is nothing more then another way to wast your money!
The focus seems to be on keeping the kids locked down with lesions and not allowing students to play the music they pick to play.
It's like making a mountain out of a mole hole.
By not letting students move on until they know every mode, scale, cord name of the basics classic rock song they are forced into learning.
Not every musician learns the same way.
Because the school picks all the music, leaves no room for self expedition or original concepts.
If you want your kids to have the tools to be in a wedding band or cheesy cover band  then SOR is for you!
Other wise, save your $300 per month and find a local music store that gives lesions and learn the basics.
