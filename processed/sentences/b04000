It  was here that I recently was able to enjoy my first Pumpkin Spiced Latte of the season!
Convenient location to grab a coffee and browse the mall.

The two times that I visited Arizona Mills, I spent time in their Starbucks, which is near the mall's south entrance.
My seat of choice overlooked the hallway.
This is a prime spot for people watching.
Every seat in this Starbucks is a prime spot for complimentary WiFi.
Over a cup of coffee with Pumpkin Spice syrup, I spent most of my time on my smart phone using their free WiFi.
The Arizona Mills Starbucks is a welcoming place.
The place is designed to encourage you to spend time (and money) instead of rushing.
The seats were so comfortable that we delayed seeing the movie at the mall's Harkins Theater by an hour.
The Arizona Mills Starbucks is clean at the same time that their baristas are fast and friendly.
If Starbucks C.E.O Howard Schultz paid a visit to this Starbucks he would do the same thing as me, which is giving them a four star rating.

Super fast staff was super friendly!
Just a heads up if you want a flavor just order a ice coffee and just get flavor in it.
It's cheaper :)

I'm not a troll.
I don't usually make bad reviews, but today was a bad day in Starbucks of the Arizona Mills Mall.
I waited in a slow moving line of only 3 people in front of me.
By the time it was my turn, I ordered a blended chai tea latte.
I would have gotten something to eat, like the double chocolate brownie, a berry coffee cake or even a banana bread.
They were out of everything, except for carrot cake, which I don't like.
Next, I waited twenty minutes for my drink.
You know what?
I paid $5.36 to wait for my drink to get to me eventually, and that is unsatisfactory!
Also, slow wi-fi.
If you're going to provide slow wi-fi, you may as well cancel it!
