I recently had all of my carpeting and tile cleaned by 702 Carpet Cleaning and they did a fantastic job!
Alex, the person who did the cleaning, was very professional, thorough and extremely careful with my furniture, tables, etc.
I have lived in my current house for 3 years, and had the carpets cleaned twice before by different people.
This time was the best by far!
I had never had the tile professionally cleaned before, and it looks amazing now!
About an hour after the job was done the home office called to see how they did.
I told them that I was very pleased.

I've always had my carpets done by Sears but 702 Carpet Cleaning was by far the best.
Alex did a wonderful job.
I had my carpets cleaned upstairs and my tiles cleaned and grouted downstairs.
Alex was in and out within 3 hours.
He was pleasant, professional and it was a pleasure dealing with this company.
A++++++
