After not having much luck at the shoe store next store, I decided to hit up Ross (which is like a TJ Maxx or Marshall's).
Much smaller than I thought, their shoe selection was pretty limited but I found an awesome pair of Steve Madden red flats for under 30 bucks that I now wear way too much.
Score!
However, their lingerie section was pretty mediocre, although their juniors section actually had some high end quality merchandise.
The womens sections wasn't bad, the guys section actually was large and home dept.
while also not large had a lot of good clearence items on things like dishes, cookware, chairs, lamps, rugs, sheets, etc.
Pretty clean store and friendly staff, I just didn't find a whole lot and didn't think it was one of the better Ross's I've been to.
But for giving me awesome shoes, I thank them.

I like this place.
Plenty of stuff to choose from.
I always get something everytime I'm here.
Prices are reasonable.
Be patient you'll find something lol.
Good customer services also.
I'll keep coming back on this location.

The sales team (including the security guard) was not so friendly or helpful.
I had to pull my car up to unload my cart (because you can't take the cart out of the store) and not one of them helped to watch my cart.
A lady who stood by said that she would watch it for me.
As soon as I unloaded my bags, the manager and security were quick to take the cart away without a "bye" "merry Christmas", "happy holidays", nothing.
This place may have great items but watch out for customer service.....it sucks!
