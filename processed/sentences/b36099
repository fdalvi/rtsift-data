Perry and his staff are just wonderful.
They have helped me where other doctors have failed.
I cannot recommend Blue Serenity Acupuncture highly enough!

Good as new in 3 treatments..place is great..

I've been getting acupuncture and chinese herbs for my migraines for a couple months now from Perry.
I'm sleeping better and my migraines while still around are much less intense.
I've gone from having twice monthly ER visits for migraines to no ER visits, so thats a pretty good improvement.
I was worried at first we wouldn't be able to afford the treatments, but its so much less than I expected and with these results, much more affordable than going to the ER and doctor all the time.
Everyone is super nice, we're able to get appointments later which is great so very little work gets missed.
The no scent policy is appreciated too.
Everything is clean and modern, and very comfortable.
I also love Heather the receptionists photography that is featured all over the place.
