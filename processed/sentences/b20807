The best meat pies in Edinburgh...but get them early as they sellout quickly each day!

Used to work with Mrs Bain... whenever we were set to come in for a spot of weekend overtime, she'd take an order of Scotch Pies....
I'd get enough to last me all week!
Good ol' John Bain makes his Scotchies with mutton as opposed to.... whatever meat's usually in Scotch Pies....!
And boy can you taste the difference.
Can't vouch for the rest of the shop, but the pies alone merit 4 stars!
