I called this place one day to get an insurance quote next thing I know I get a bill from them saying I owe them fo rinsurance, even though I've never been to their office, never signed anything, never payed anything and never requested a policy.
So of course I had to call again and find out what this was all about.
They had the nerve to tell me I had a policy with them even though I only asked for a quote.
I ignored their ridiculous demand for payment for a service I did not use , demand or pay for.
I have Geico thank-you.
Now after 5-6 months I am receiving letters from a collection agency trying to recover Mr. Orchards nearly $200 fee for giving me a quote.

Awesome customer service!
The customer service rep in the front was very helpful and answered all my questions.
Gary is very knowledgeable and gave me the coverage I needed while saving me tons of money.

I used to be insured with progressive and came here to get a quote because I was referred by a few good friends their price blew progressive out of the water so I immediately switched over to them that same day.
I also just purchased renters insurance with them and went in to the office to meet the agents and staff I was delighted to see how friendly and customer service oriented they all are.
Ive been with them for months now and have no complaints I made a great choice.
...
I also came to find out that this agency is #1 in their district!
I recommend everyone to call in for at least a quote and see how much you save!
