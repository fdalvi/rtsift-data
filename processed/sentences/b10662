I was looking for a place to replace the battery in my watch.
It has always been  like pulling teeth to find someone to who will even touch my watches as most of them are Gucci watches.
If they were willing to replace the battery, they wanted to charge upwards of 30 dollars and up just because of the brand!
I happened to be on W. Sahara in Las Vegas when i decided to find a jewelry repair on Siri.
Gold Rush Jewelry Design was the first and closet entry on the list.
I decided  to stop and check.
To my surprise, not only were the owners very nice and down-to-earth, but I was in and out of there in less than 10 minutes and they only charged me 10 bucks!
I highly recommend you patronize this store.
It was a pleasure...and Krazy Buffet is in the  same mall!!
Love that place too!

Nice little jewelry shop tucked away in Summerlin.
I got there about 5:40PM (they close at 6) and I was out the door about 5:48PM with a new watch battery installed.
They even set the time and date, and it only cost me $10.
They work on all watches.
I would definitely recommend this place to others.

Gold Rush Jewelry Design, owner, Alfonso is extremely unfriendly and rude.
Before you buy anything at his shop, be absolutely sure you like your merchandise and unlikely to change your mind about it BECAUSE once bought your merchandise and left his shop, there is NO after sale service whatsoever.
He refused to replace the off color diamonds in my ear-rings that he has set.
He told me he could do nothing about it.
I will NEVER go back to his shop again !
