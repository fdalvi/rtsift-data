I have see Tiffany several times for a shoulder and back waxing and was very impressed all across the board.
She has a nice private salon with a great location and had a personality that was extremely comfortable and welcoming.
I've returned and will continue to return because it is a much better value and convenience than other places I've experienced.
I would highly recommended Tiffany to anyone in the east valley looking for an aesthetician or waxing of any kind.
