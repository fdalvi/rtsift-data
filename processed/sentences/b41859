Tried this place out since it just opened.
I really enjoyed my experience.
Julie took her time doing my nails to make sure they were perfect.
The owner walked around and checked in with the customers to make sure they were doing okay.
It is very clean and pretty inside.
This will definitely be my new nail place.

The owner and his wife Linda are very welcoming and friendly.
I highly recommend this nail salon.
Mani pedi's here are the best!

Right now their services are 30% off so I decided to give it a try!
Ends up I will be coming back!
It is very clean and brand new!
The gel colors available are endless so many I stopped looking:) They also have the perfect match for a pedi with regular nail polish next to the gel color which I loved!
Overall the customer service was legit and I plan to be a repeat customer!

My mother and I were driving by and happened to stop in to get our feet done.
We walked in after they were closed and still made us feel welcome.
We will definitely be going back, everyone is very nice and outgoing.
The salon is Very clean and beautiful.
I recommend Linda, Chi, and Andy, they all were very nice, polite, and out going.
We had a great time and look forward to coming back.
