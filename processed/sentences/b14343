Online check in makes the whole hair cut process a lot easier.
I gave this a 4 star because I liked my haircut and the check in.

service and quality are unreliable: one of the best haircuts I've ever had, but mostly mediocre and sometimes really awful service

This great clips is not crowded.
But not the best when compared to 34th ave and some others nearby.
Went in once and they started cutting my hair..No question on what you want to do or what clipper you use & I was first time there
