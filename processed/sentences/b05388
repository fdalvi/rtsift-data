I own a 2005 VW Touareg that was driving very rough, and my check engine light came on.
Desert VW quoted me almost $2000 for a new transmission, even though they weren't even sure that was the problem.
Pacific Auto Care diagnosed bad spark plugs and a hole in the vacuum  hose.
It cost me less than $500.
I was thisclose to letting Desert VW try and fix it -- so happy I went to Pacific!
My car now runs perfectly.

I went to Pacific because its close to home but continue to go because of the great honest service.
They always do a great job at fair prices.

I got stuck in Vegas with a blown head gasket.
Pacific Auto was fantastic.
They repaired my vehicle quickly and gave us rides to/from hotel.
They were honest and went out of their way to try to finish the repair in less time than they quoted.
Price was competitive and didn't increase even though they found the job to be harder than they anticipated.
I'd go back to them first next time.

Ten times faster than dealership for getting me a new window for my unique car!
Super friendly down to earth guys and gave me a good deal too!
