This place is awesome!
The gelato is so fresh and flavorful - made on-site!
The decor is fun modern italian.
Fantastic flavors, great atmosphere,  the best dessert spot in the South Valley!

Ok I've only ever had the gelato here, although they do have a small dessert case filled with cupcakes and cake slices  However, their gelato is so good, why get anything else?
A small with two scoops is $3 Not too shabby!
My favorite flavor is strawberry with chocolate gelato.
It's like eating chocolate covered strawberries....
yum!!

Not a fan.
The Gelato was ok, at best.
And the bad thing was that they had Costco muffins for sale.
ah, that's not good.
at least be creative.

Not the best Gelato I have had.
Nope.
Its okay for a hot summer day but it wasn't like I am craving it or anything.
Nothing like Frost in Tucson, although they do carry the flavor Striciatella.
The chocolate with hazelnut was okay, except there were hardly any hazelnuts in it.
The chocolate was okay too but there were no chocolate shavings in it either....It tastes more like regular ice cream than gelato, so don't know if I care for it that much.
The place is hip and cool though.
The scoops are way small than Frost size servings.
The owner was there and apparently they make all their stuff right on site.
I asked her if she had yogurt too and she said that sometimes they make it but its so hard to make so she tends to be lazy on that part.
Nice people though.
Will take friends here.

This is the best gelato.
They have a variety of flavors.
i only go here as a special treat considering the price.
The presentation is nice and the seating is cozy.
They do have actual food but I have never tried it, although it smells amazing.
