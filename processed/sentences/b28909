It's a pity that this restaurant is hidden off the beaten track, because the food here is very tasty and the service is very good.
I have only been to three Thai restaurants but this is by far the best one I have been to and the food has been consistently good on the four times I have been there.
I have found a firm favourite dish in the red curry, which always tastes delicious.
The restaurant provides good value for money with the servings you get and also offers BYOB, which is an added bonus on the wallet.
The d√©cor of the restaurant is pretty simple but this shouldn't take anything away from the fact that this is a hidden gem in Edinburgh.
