Its holiday time and that means a trip to Hallmark..cuz when you care enough.. LOL Well this location is perfect for me since its so close to home.
I had never been here either.
I always ended up at the one in the District.
They have a great selection of ornaments and of course I found some.
As well as cards & wrap.
I did have to juggle my things around the store for a few until a salesperson offered to take my load up to the front.
That gets  minus star..they should be paying better attention.
I did end up spending 60 bucks!
LOL Until next year Hallmark...

Nice store, large selection.

A card costs how much?
Upwards of $7-$8 were on the high end of the scale.
For any special occasion Hallmark has the exact sentiment printed.
I just don't get how paper could cost so much.
I am a windbag that loves to write my own messages into cards and they are no cheaper.
The average cost of cards are somewhere around $4.
I sometimes wonder if people even keep the card.
For something that gets tossed aside for the gift, I feel like I am getting fleeced.
Besides cards, they carry stuffed animals, decorative wine glasses, wrapping paper, gift bags, and other trinkets.
