I haven't been inside a portrait studio since I was changing my sisters diapers... she's 17 now.
I went into this Picture People location to get a free/promotional 8x10 for a modeling gig I'm trying out for.
Well, they were super quick with the shots and I had a great gal taking the pictures.
It took 5 minutes after the shoot for her to pull up the best shots and have me look through my favorites to pick out the 8x10.
I only came in to get the free 8x10, but I liked another photo so much I decided to buy a sheet which was reasonably priced.
The quality was so clear and the positions and the angle was perfect.
The photographer really knew her business and didn't pressure me to buy anything!
I think we can all agree that we hate being pressured to purchase and there was none of that with The Picture People!

We had 3 families for pictures.
Me, my wife and son along with my sister, her husband and two daughters and my sister in law, her three kids and her sister.
Everything was fine until we asked to look at one of the pictures on the view finder of her camera and was rudely told that we were not allowed because of copyright issues.
I understand copyright and their need to be paid for what they sell but not the abrupt way it was told to us.
What made this even worse was the fact that not only wouldn't she let us view any of the pictures on the view finder, she acted as though she was checking each one after it was taken for smiles and closed eyes but she was very wrong on those counts.
One of the individual family photos had the Mom with her eyes closed and the other shot with the same pose had the Mom with no smile.
It would have been nice if the photographer actually looked in order to get some good shots.

I had a great time.
i thought the pictures of us came out great

Just had a great experience having baby photos taken.
The photographer made some very nice photos.
will deffinatly be back.

It has been quite a few years since I visited Picture People for portraits and in the past (pre-Yelp), my experiences were mediocre at best.
Today we had a great experience and I'm pretty jazzed about how cool my 2 year old's pictures turned out.
What went well: **Online appointment process was EASY and problem-free **Started our session right on time **Only had to wait 30 minutes for prints to be ready **Got some very nice shots despite lack of connection with photographer **Great location--NOT in the mall anymore so a lot less distracting!
**Decent pricing for packages **Prints were very clear and excellent quality  What I wish would be better when I have a portrait session is that the photographers be less stiff with kids.
For a studio that specializes in child photography, my photographer and the other that was working while I was there were both just very stiff when working with kids.
Kids won't warm up and genuinely smile if they don't connect with you.
But then, most adults won't smile genuinely either if there's no connection.
I had to work REALLY hard to get my boy to smile.
If you have a kid who doesn't smile on command or has a hard time warming up to strangers who are stiff around kids, keep this in mind when working with Picture People.
Our portraits did come out beautifully, but not without a great deal of effort on my part.
I will definitely go back because of all the reasons I mentioned above though.
The end certainly justified the means.

Visiting family, we had a sitting with a new baby.
The photographer was excellent and patient.
The studio was cool (temperature wise), clean and professional.
You review your proofs in minutes and pick up picture the same day.
I ordered a collage and the photographer ran down all the packages, combos, and discounts based on what we were looking for so it was easy to figure out what to get, than trying to calculate which was the best deal in our heads.
I wish I could recall her name.
My sister has a membership and it seems like a beneficial program if you have a growing family and need professional pictures done throughout the coming years.
Highly recommended *but go early and plan ahead if taking a small one.
Earlier appointments, you tend to have the place to yourself.
