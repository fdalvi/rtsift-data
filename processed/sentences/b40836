New place opening, tons of work by great people!
Phoenix indoor karting, hobbytown USA and a bar and grill!!
We look forward to seeing new faces and getting to know you all!

Terribly disorganized.
Youth and adults use same karts, with youth throttled slower.
Smaller youths will need pedal extenders and struggle with arm strength to make sharp turns.
Cannot redeem RC car vouchers after 1:00p.
Advertised free WiFi,  but did not have it.

Pure chaos.
Front counter staff struggled with the computer systems that did not allow more than one transaction at a time.
Families with multiple people racing have to be processed individually.
People seem to be selected for races at the whim of the track attendants.
Kids races run in the same carts, but at a slower speed.
Condiments at "Your Behind BBQ" are stored in room temp water that was likely ice at some point earlier in the day.
