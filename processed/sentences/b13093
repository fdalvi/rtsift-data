The Lombardo family is passionate about their gelato.
They have 3 locations, all housed in bright, tidy kiosks inside various Valley malls.
The service is extremely friendly and the gelato, delicious.
I also thought it was a nice touch that the signs were written in Italian, with the English translations below them.
They offer approximately 18 flavors, which rotate depending on what the Lombardos decide to make that day.
When I last visited the line-up included seasonal flavors such as mango and tangerine, as well as regional specialties, like horchata and prickly pear (!).
And of course, there are the more traditional vanilla bean, chocolate, coffee and sweet cream.
Good news for the west valley -- there are 2 Lombardos there!

Lombardo's Gelato is no longer in the Fiesta Mall.
They are in Arizona Mills Mall and Metro Center Mall.
Their gelato is absolutely amazing.
When they say that it is a certain flavor, you can guarantee that it will be that flavor.
It is all natural, no preservatives.
If you have an opportunity to be where they have a location, I highly recommend you trying a sample.
Try as many as you like, you will not be disappointed.
My favorite is the pink grapefruit, but coconut and pineapple are wonderful as well.
