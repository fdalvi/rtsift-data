Mr Modos is a bar/pub, with quite a 'rock' element to it.
Situated in the Tollcross area of Edinburgh, Mr Modos is just a short walk from the city centre, and it is a great place to go for pre-drinks on the way to a night out.
The decor inside is really fantastic, it is quite funky and quirky, with soft rock music playing in the background.
Mr Modos offers an extremely vast range of drinks, with beers from all over the world, Bulmers cider on tap, tasty wines, and best of all, an extensive cocktail menu including the standard Margarita's - yum, and the more unusual Chocolate Chili Martini - not yet brave enough to try!
There are plenty of drinks offers available, and the cocktails cost less than £5 - bargain!
There is a jukebox which plays great music and there is a quiz night once a week.
The drinks are cheap and the atmosphere is friendly and lively so Mr Modos is a great place to chill out with with friends, or to begin serious pre-drinks before a big night out.

You know when you want to go somewhere to drink that isn't full of idiots and pop music?
And it's cheap?
This is it, this is the place.
I love this place.
I love absolutely everything about it.
First things first, it's cheap as chips.
£6 for a bottle of house wine.
You pay more than that for a nasty Merlot in the hideously overpriced Sainsbury's on the quartermile.
Cocktails are under a fiver.
Really you shouldn't need any more reasons to go, but I'll give you more.
It's really quirkily decorated inside.
Not in a way that's try too hard (take note Jekyll & Hyde), just in a cool, interesting way.
The staff are friendly, the music's good and there's usually a good crowd in there.
It's just a very good place to be, that's all there is to it.
Highly recommended for pre drinks, post drinks, all drinks.
