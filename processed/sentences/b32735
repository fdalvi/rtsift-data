She is the best!
I'd call her before you call anyone else

Got a ticket going 11 miles over in a construction zone!
Plus no proof of ins ( wasn't my car couldn't fine it).
Bill was $1433!
Called ticket lady, spoke to very helpful staff.
They got it reduced to illegal parking $195, no points, no traffic school, no proof of ins dismissed!!
I'm very happy & have already recommend them to people.
Saved me money & time.
Hassle free!
They even called & sent letter letting me know the outcome.
Very fair fee for their awesome service:)

I wouldn't do business with this law firm even if it was the last traffic ticket lawyer on earth.
I rather pay the fee and go to traffic school then have them rip me off.
It's the principle that's important to me.
To make a long story short, basically the customer service representative I dealt with was really hard to get on the phone and there technology are old (I had to request using e-mails as a faster way to communicate, they just deal with faxing.
They don't have a system that will keep you posted on your case.
I don't know if they even have a website).
Well back to the review, I initially talked to a representative and she told me it will be around $250-$300 dollars because I wanted to budget my finances then the next time I talked to her, she gave me a different quote of $300-$400 dollars.
Now, I think she wouldn't do that on purpose but that's just poor business practice keeping track of new potential customer's conversations.
Therefore, I took my business to a different law firm that I can trust.
