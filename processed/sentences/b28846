Iconic has been closed a few times when I've passed by, but they were perhaps on their lunchbreak or I was too late.
I was desperate to get a peek inside as they had some gorgeous teapots in the window and was so excited when I finally saw them open earlier this week.
Iconic was as cool as I had dreamed it would be.
From old pin-up postcards from the 50s and 60s to first generation Snoopy toys, it was the cult collector's paradise.
They had some figurines dating up to the mid 90s (Austin Powers still in his original box) and a bizarrely wonderful assortment of antique tacky holiday souvenirs and crockery.
They had a fantastic collection of old toys and dolls that would interest many generations of visitors.
It is interesting for a look, but i knew I wasn't going to leave empty handed.
I ended up walking out with a cat egg cup holder for Â£5.
i don't even like egg, but I love that darn cat crockery.
It looks like it's from the 70s and now sits proudly on my mantelpiece.
The owner was friendly and helpful, and he had a wee doggie sitting in the doorframe!
It was simply a lovely shop that I will definitely return to.
It had some utterly unique, beguiling stock.

Great little shop!
Basil the dog makes the visit even more special.
We found a couple of treasures we were searching for and got them at a great price.
Great place to stop in for a peek when in the Grassmarket area.
