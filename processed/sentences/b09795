Had an eye exam and a couple of pairs of glasses ordered from this location.
The exam was thorough and professional.
However, my problem was with the staff.
You would think after spending almost $500, you'd be afforded good service.
Apparently, this chain has scraped the bottom of the barrel when it comes to their non-medical staff.
When I called to find out if my glasses were ready, the young lady I spoke to left me on hold for 25 minutes.
I hung up the phone and called back.
No apology, just was told by one of her fellow workers that she was scatterbrained because she was pregnant.
WTF??
The saving grace was the assistant manager (Stacy).
I was pretty ticked when I showed up.
She took control, fitted my glasses (two pairs) and wouldn't allow me to leave the store until my glasses were cleaned and I was satisfied that they fit perfectly.
Kudos to this young lady .
Would I return?
Hmm... Only if I can get service from this assistant manager.

Just heard the young lady working state "those were our last patients.
Their appointment was at 6:10.
" So, show up 2 hours early for your appointment, and bump everyone else out of theirs!?
Unacceptable!

The doctor there doesn't have customer service skills or understand how to talk with patients.
I went there for an exam and he had me look through two lenses, never asked me how I could see the letter, after the 15 seconds of the two lenses he told me my prescription was going to stay the same.
Never looked into whether my vision has gotten any better or worse and didn't take the time to seem to care.
I did complain to the manager Rachel who was wonderful in understanding and didn't charge me for the visit.
I did make it clear I would not return to their vision centers with doctors of that knowledge.
I have used them for two years previous and will no longer go there.
