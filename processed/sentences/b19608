I am a computer Nit wit.
The machine I was using was so slow and I knew the security  on it was a mess.
I saw the movie "Untraceable", about home computers and lack of security.
It scared me to death.
I knew I had to get a new computer but was clueless.
Marlies at Leo Polus was wonderful.
She asked me a lot of questions regarding how I use my home computer and what I needed it to do.
Then  Andre actually helped me order it from HP.
Once again, I would have had no idea what to get!
Once it came he then came over to my house and set it all up.
It was a terrific experience.
They do website design, PC repair, data backup, hardware, software, networking, tech support, training and consulting.
Andre has over 10 years of experience.
It is technology you can trust and can afford.

My PC Techs provides honest and expert tech advice, computer maintenance, website creation and SEO services.
They are affordable and a delight to work with.

I was very impressed and comfortable with My PC Techs when came to my home to help me with my computers.
I always have alot of questions and they answered them all.
They set up a security system  and a backup systems for me, plus some other maintence.
They were very easy to work with.
