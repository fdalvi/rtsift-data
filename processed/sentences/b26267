Can not say enough nice things about Dr. Death.
Very thorough and reliable.
I would recommend him to anyone.
He helped me out with a tough situation!
NO MOR BUGS ever since!

Dr. Death takes care of the pest control at my apartment complex.
Before this company, I used to see various bugs and spiders roaming about & sometimes even in the house!
Since Dr. Death, I haven't seen any bug activity in or around my home.
Helps me sleep easier knowing there aren't any critters causing a ruckus!

Dr Death Pest Control (Trevor) has been my bug guy since I moved into my home, 5 years ago.
I have to tell ya, we tried them all.
Not only has he been the best at keeping away unwanted pests, but no contract and the best price in town.
But what I really enjoy about Dr Death Pest Control is, during our consultation, he listened and understood our concerns about the chemicals and our animals.
He assured us that his chemicals were pet friendly.
I will never use anyone else.
Thanks Trevor!
You are the best!

Trever and Ty are super nice and professional.
We just moved into a house and we had scorpions.
They came the same day and sprayed.
Very polite and answered all of our questions.
Thanks again guys!!

Have used their service twice in two years.
They returned my call relatively quickly.
Appointment was scheduled not too far out each time.
They did not try to push their continuous service.
I just needed a one time spray.
They sprayed outside and inside thoroughly.
This year I asked them to also spray the porch as well as inside the garage, which they did using something stronger.
Overall, polite, professional, fair pricing, and no upselling involved.
Highly recommended.
