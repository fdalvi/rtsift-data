Dr Striblen and Jessica are great at what they do however they need help in hiring their staff.
They are absolutely the rudest and most unprofessional that I have ever seen.
I was in the e.r.
Making an appointment for the next day with Jessica.
I called on my way to the appointment letting them know that I would not be able to make the appointment because I was on my way back to the e.r.
The person answering the phone sounded like the woman (Brenda) who checks you out, you know the one with the personality of a dead fish, and all she was concerned about was telling me I was gong to get a 25.00 fee for missing my appointment.
I told her I was on my way to the e.r.
and her response was that's fine I'll let Jessica know but I would still have the 25.00 fee.
She had the compassion of an ice cube.
It's too bad that the staff has such a reflection on the doctor.
Usually a rude staff means a bad doctor.
Not the case here but they sure need better help.

We have been patients of Sundance Medical and Dr Heather Harris since we moved here two years ago.
I go once a month for an injection.
I can walk in without appt  and have never waited more than 1/2hr.
My wife is very pleased with the level of care  she's received  with Dr. Harris.
The staff  is busy but  professional.
They call back promptly when busy.
Our prescriptions and refills are always authorized quickly.

I was on time and been waiting for 40 minutes now!
Direct care patients are supposed to be seen within 15 minutes!
And yes I'm sure the consultation will only be 5 minutes!!
They need to get it together!

Rude staff , our appointment was at 1:45 it is 3:21 and we are still here this is ridiculous never coming back
