I'm a mexican food nut and this place was recommended to me by a Latino friend.
The fajitas are incredible, chips, salsa and guac are homemade - everything is fresh and authentic.
Having the live mariachi singers only adds to the atmosphere.
Services was good, prices were fair, no complaints.

What an incredible find.
Awesome pazole and chorizo and eggs.
Great service, wonderful atmosphere, air-conditioned Nicely.

Went there on a slow Sunday with some hiking buddies.
The place is more appealing inside.
Nice warm atmosphere that can accommodate larger groups.
The menu has plenty of choices and the food is good though not excellent  I had the California Burrito which is vegetarian but I also added chicken.
Complimentary salsa and chips.
Beer and wine only and those are limited in choices.
Pleasant service.
OVerall a good experience.
I will be back.

Picked up a sea food tostadas lunch for us.
The octopus was very tender, little on the pricey side but worth it.
Surprised that they do seafood do well considering our distance from the ocean.
Well very likely return when we're in the neighborhood.
