Visting from Hawaii, stopped at the North Premium Outlets for shopping and food.
Daughter wanted yogurt so we stopped in.
Service is terrible.
They have 2 lines, one for salad and one for smoothies and yogurts.
Stood in line for yogurt which only had one other person in front of me.
Salad line was super long, about 8 people in line.
Waited for a long time.
Person in front complained that she was standing there for awhile.
After taking her order, cashier totally ignors me and the growing line waiting for smoothies and yogurt.
I ask loudly if there were 2 lines or 1.
They replied 2 seperate lines (one for salad and one for smoothies) so i question why the salad line cashier was able to take care of 8 people compared with 1 in the smoothie line.
Asked for a manager, Chris (the manager) does not apologize and does not take my order, rather he defends his cashier by telling me that everyone goes their own speed and that I assume he thinks it was perfectly fine that she couldn't even handle taking more then one order compared to the cashier next to her taking 8 orders.
Another women worker steps in and handles the situation, takes my order and then does not take my money.
She should be the manager, not Chris.
Chris does not know how to manage his employees nor how to give quality customer service.
Filed a complaint with Green Leaf's Beyond Great Salads with my email and phone number, no follow up.
I guess this is how they handle business.
No customer service what so ever on either end.

Green Leaf's and Bananas is located in the food court of Las Vegas Premium Outlets North.
Green Leaf's has made to order salads whereas Bananas serves smoothies and frozen yogurt.
There are two lines respectively, and they both seemed to move slowly.
We ended up ordering a Mango Magic smoothie and it took a while for us to get it as well.
The smoothie itself wasn't as delicious as I'd hoped it be.

Very tasty fresh food!
Sandwich not visually appealing but very tasty!
(Turkey chipolte).
Friends got wrap that they made fresh because she didn't want cheese.
Great healthy choice!

This restaurant is a very healthy option for somebody watching their carbohydrate intake.
I had the chicken avocado sandwich which was very tasty.
It had fresh avocado, and was very light and healthy.
A plus on a SUPER hot day shopping at the mall in Vegas.
