I am all about the wide shoes with my Fred Flintsone feet but not  when they look like shoes my grandmother would wear.
A fairly large  selection.
You'll need a car to get there, go past Luxor and  Mandalay Bay and keep driving, on the left side in a small strip mall.

Leonard's carries women's shoe sizes up to a 14 or 15--but you better have a E-width or wider shoe to buy there.
And there are two basic styles--grandma's shoes or cross dresser shoes.
Being the only shoe store in town to carry a decent selection for those with a shoe size greater than 10, it's a shame that they only cater to those with double-wide feet.
They've also moved locations over by the Hard Rock Hotel and now carry a selection of clothing that would make someone's grandma proud, but not mine.

Leonard's is closing down!!
:o(  I was there on June 1, 2009 and the salesman told me that the store is closing down and that they've just marked down all their items for sale.
Quick, get there before it shuts down in July!
New Balance shoes for at least $49.95!!
What a steal!!
I bought 3 pairs!

I'm Very pleased to see they've closed.
I dealt with them once.
The owner was a rude jerk.
