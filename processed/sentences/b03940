I've been to Dr. Waring now twice.
He is an outstanding physician!
The Doctor and his staff are very professional and nice.
I have high anxiety every time I go to Dentists and Doctors and these people make me feel very comfortable.
His office and facilities are very nice and modern.

For over 20 years I have been a patient of Dr Waring.
He's outstanding as a periodontist, plus he takes great pride in his work.
I go there four times a year for teeth cleaning and find the entire staff great to work with.

I found Dr. Waring not particularly attentive to my needs as a patient.
