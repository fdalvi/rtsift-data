I described this place as a hellhole on Saturday night & stand by that description - a favourite spot for hen nights, stag nights, sports teams etc.
all of which seem to feel the need to congregate at the far too narrow part of the already densely packed bar making movement anywhere a nightmare.
The courtyard outside is a better bet when the weather's good enough and occasionally an ad hoc bar is erected along with a bbq but generally you have to put up with the crowded indoors to to get served.
There's a gigantic tv screen outside too but it's not got particularly good anti-glare protection so if you plan to watch any sports here then you need to get along early, claim a spot indoors & put up with the throng.

Busy bar which is big on sport mainly rugby , has big screens and sometimes has very good deals on for food/drink.
Very popular with students and hen/stag parties but a bit of the beaten track but walkable up to royal mile.
