You have to visit this store!
If you love original products that are useful and beautiful check it out!
I recently purchased a back pack from here and took it all over Canada...hiking, biking, fishing and kayaking and it was a champion!
The compartments were great so I could protect my wallet in a crowd...there is a nice water bottle holder as well.
Most of all I can wash it and it is just like new!

Ok, yes I am a guy and this is most definitely a ladies store, but I wanted to buy my Mom a nice Birthday Present.
I knew she liked Vera Bradley and so I went to have a look.
The sales clerk Cecile, was amazingly helpful.
Since my Mom loves the Beach and we had a trip planned right around her birthday, Cecile steered me toward a nice beachy color scheme.
We started with a nice Beach Bag and then added a towel, hat, some flip flops and a few miscellaneous items.
Everyone made me feel welcome and my Mom loved the present.
So guys are welcome at Vera Bradley, just ask for Cecile and she will set you up.

Oh How my family loves Vera Bradley.
I have 4 little girls that just love to go in and see all the new stuff.
A sales girl by the name of Holly took great care of us.
She offered a wish list for the girls and they were in heaven writing down all of their wishes.
Yes we had a great time at Vera.
Go and see Holly she will fix you right up.
