After my car accident in January I contacted Parker Scheer to help with my case and they were nothing but supportive and helpful going above and beyond to make sure that everything was taken care of while I recovered.
Everyone was available to answer any questions I had and they were all very nice as well.
I'm a very satisfied client and would trust Parker Scheer with any future cases.

The people at this law firm are nothing but understanding and helpful.
They took care of everything for me; which left me little to stress about.
I would and have recommended them to anyone in need of an attorney.
I worked in a law office and have had another auto accident case dealt with at a different law firm and these guys are by far the best!

Andre and the staff at PSL are the most understanding, helpful and reliable group I have ever worked with.
Prompt with calls, updates and responses to questions .... their customer service is by far the best of any law firm that I have ever needed to work with.
I would recommend them 100% of the time to anyone who asks me for the name of an attorney.
