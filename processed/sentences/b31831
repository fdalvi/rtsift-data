Been coming here for over twenty years!
25 bucks for an oil change that takes fifteen minutes and never a line!
As a woman it's important to me to have a mechanic I can trust.
No worries at Action Fast!
These guys you can trust!
Thanks Action Fast for all your hard work and devotion!
See ya in 3,000 miles!

Make sure you tell Jay that you saw the Action Fast Lube ratings on Yelp.
Didn't see a $25 dollar oil change option,  I got the 5,000 miles oil , new filter, fluids check and tire pressure set to my requested setting for $47.00.
Was in & out in under 25 minutes.
Can't beat that.
See you guys in Oct.

Quick, friendly service at a fair price.
They changed the oil and checked the tire pressure for me in 15 min.
I paid 27.54 including tax.
I was not bombarded with a sales pitch for over $1000, but was told, in an honest and polite manner, that I could get a broken door handle fixed for $75 (other places have quoted that same fix for over $100).
Finally, found the place I'll be getting my oil changed on a regular basis!
Tip: Action Fast Lube is located next to Sun Devil Auto, they are separate businesses.
Action Fast entrance is behind the store.

Really pleased with the quality and speed of service at this place.
Definitely will be my go-to place for oil changes.
