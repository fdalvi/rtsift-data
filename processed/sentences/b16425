I have been to the Family Dollar on a few occasions but haven't really bought too much there.
The store is pretty organized and clean and they have lots of items to browse through, which is nice.
On this occasion, we were looking for a bandana to complete my fella's Halloween ensemble.
Lucky for us, they had exactly what we needed.
Overall, it's a cute little store and has lots of different types of items to shop for.

Since the recession I'm all about saving a buck or two for household stuff.
Family Dollar is one of the places we go to now for cleaning supplies and other household things, such as an iron and ironing board.
It's your basic money-saving place, but beware- it's not a .99 cent store so things cost more than a dollar.

Saw a flyer in the mail, and found the perfect little metal table for my patio.
Only $5, I could not pass that up for the low price.
I had never been in a Family Dollar, and was surprised to see that they carry cosmetics, clothes, kitchen supplies, holiday decorations...pretty much everything.
Even food.
The items that you would expect to be expensive were extremely cheap, while other things were over priced.
I am happy with my metal table though, as it was a bargain.
