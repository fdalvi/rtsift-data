Pretty neat "one-stop-shop" for pretty much anything that you might need or want.
Prices are a little higher than other conveniance-type stores, but their selection seems better, especially in the booze department.
Staff is nice and friendly, but they seem (look) overworked - ?
I hope they are treated well by the owners, because they always greet me with a smile when I'm in there.
Hopefully the Circle-K opening across the street does not hurt them too bad.

Everyone at this store treats me like a friend.
I've been going here since I moved into the Taylor Ranch community right next door from Chevron.
They have opened up a Circle K that is slightly cheaper on gas sometimes but not always, but I still go to Chevron.
The folks there have earned my business and I've got to know them over the years.
I go into that store once to twice a day and not once in 6 years have I had a bad experience.
I suggest shopping here because they are family owned as well so unlike Circle K you won't be sending money to some giant corporate conglomerate, but rather an American family.
It may just be a gas station, but it's worth mentioning that this is a great establishment.

Still get great service here no matter what time of day or night.
Another local business to support, especially with all the big boxes surrounding him.
Gantzel Farms used to be the only place to go years ago - I still visit them whenever I can.
Support the mom and pops in your local area!

Just thought I'd write an update since I shop here a couple of  times per week.
There are several new employees, and they are all very nice - Like another reviewer said, they treat customers like friends, and this is very welcome.
Circle K across the street has gone downhill FAST, where Gantzel Farms has stepped it up quite a bit.
Nice!
