Always good, friendly, and hot.
My family likes this "Chinese" best in Sun Prairie.
The food is even better of you eat it "in".
Never full of customers (is that good?
), it seems like they do a lot of take-out business.
There is delivery.
Not much updated decor.
Good for when you want local basic Amer/Asian, same menu as all the rest.
Some days it's better than others, but never bad.

I ate there 2 times.
I recommend sea food soup, spicy salty shrimp, Singapore rice noodle.
The location is not that good.
It's in Sun Prairie, a suburb area from Madison, WI.
I believe if the location is in downtown Madison, it would be one of the top Chinese restaurant in Madison.

Panda Garden is the best place to get Chinese food in Sun Prairie.
And they deliver which is a plus in my book!
I've eaten in the restaurant a couple of times, but usually do take out.
I've never had anything I didn't like there (and we've tried a very good array of items).
Tonight we had the Garlic Shrimp and Chicken Lo Mein.
Both were awesome!
The Garlic Shrimp had a nice spicy kick to it, but still had a TON of flavor!
The crab Rangoon and pot stickers are also tasty!
Pricing is very reasonable for what you get!

I love this place.
The fried dumplings are to die for.

Easy on-line menu, great selection and fabulous food.
I ordered hot/ sour soup, egg roll and chicken/ broccoli.
All of it was great.
I can't wait to go back.

Every time my boyfriend and I eat here, it has been great.
We really enjoy the steamed dumplings and hot and sour soup.
The staff is very friendly, too.

I was unhappy due to having to wait 55 minutes for my one meal (steamed veggies combo with chicken, shrimp and scallops!
Then I get two pieces of shrimp, three small slices of chicken a few tiny scallops!!
For $12.00 that is a rip off, a joke and unacceptable!
You going to charge for food with those items in you better put more than sliced veggies!!
I will never come back!
