It's next to my house so I have to give it a 3 stars since we always fill the car there before any trip we take

my morning coffee stop on the way to work.
Staff is always nice even thought it is 6 in the morning.

Reasonably priced gas station/store next to Fox Rental car.

This place isn't here anymore!
This is the 5th time on our trip that yelp has do e this to is.
