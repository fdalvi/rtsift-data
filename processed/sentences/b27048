Free Coffee Mondays this March....
Yeah!!!
Grabbed me an Idea Coffee this morning along with a Flat bread Sandwich & Hashbrowns...   All was good... my coffee needed more sugar but we all know How "  we" take our coffee is so Personal.
So I don't blame'em.
No 5 stars just because nothing was WOW about my visit.
the staff was nice & wished me a good day   oh I know why only 4 stars... they were out of Katsup for my hashbrowns... that tells me management may be lacking just a little.
Over all we will be back.

This was a decent Dunkin Donuts until it went out of business.

Growing up on DD and moving out west, where there is no DD *ahem* near me,  I was excited to see Dunkin Donuts in LV.
This particular kiosk at the outlet mall, was a little of center from the other franchises I've been at.
I didnt have any donuts, but I had a coolatta or I thought....It took them a while to even acknowledge me and take my order.
Only reason I got the drink is because of a sign the had up at the counter stating the price, I wound up paying $1 more, and it wasnt even like the picture.
It had coffee and WHOLE ice cubes...ahh..ok...I didn't argue because I just wanted to parch my thirst in the LV sun...but I was sorely disappointed.
