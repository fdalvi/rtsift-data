I never thought I'd review a liquor store, but here I am...  A month or 2 ago I was on my way to a friends house and needed to grab a 6-pack and didn't feel like dealing with going to Fry's.
I live nearby and have passed this place daily for the last 2 year but had never stepped inside.
There was plenty of selection and the prices were decent.
The staff is friendly and always good for a laugh.
Since then Greenway Liquor has become my go-to place for my alcoholic needs, and I will be coming back again and again.

have been using these guys for a while!
they have been taking great care of our party kegs and other needs for 3 years!
we dont go anywhere else!

Great selection and great customer service.
And there's a drive thru.
I've been a customer for 8 years, no complaints!
