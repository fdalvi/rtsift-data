I don't often write reviews but when I do, it means only one thing.
It's one awesome place!
Been looking for a barber since my regular one left town last month.
Saw this here at Yelp and decided to try them out.
It's a no frills, gets the job done, hair place for us guys.
Jeff is friendly and very talented.
He has made me into a regular!

I have been coming here for several months and have found a great barber shop!
Jeff and Angel both are fantastic "old school" barbers who know their crap.
They do an awesome job for a fair price.
The place is clean and the environment is quite manly!
I feel almost nostalgic smelling the aftershave and mixture of hair tonics that are in the background.
Definitely a place my father would have come for a shave and a cut...

Phenomenal barber shop!
I got a great razor fade, at a reasonable price, and some interesting conversation to boot.
If I'm in the area and I need a haircut I know where I'll be going!

Came here while in LV for business.
Not open on Monday.
Regular cut was $15.
Haircut quality?
Average--I've had better.
PROS: air conditioning; friendly barber  CONS: quality of cut was just "okay", but the barber didn't meet all my requests  I was traveling and needed a haircut.
Came to Yelp.
Regret to say, I do not understand all the 5-star ratings.
I asked for "tapered and blocked in the back", and the barber failed to deliver.
Same for "thin it out all around", which to him, ostensibly meant "here and there".
Cheers!

Jeff is great.

I've been coming to this barber shop for 11 years.
A simple men's haircut is $15 and the price hasn't ever changed.
There are only two barbers; Angel and Jeff.
They are both fantastic!
Each are meticulous about the details of your haircut.
They finish each cut with a straight blade razor around the edges and the back of the neck.
I am so very impressed with this barber shop.
Do yourself a favor and come spend some time with Jeff and Angel and get a GREAT haircut.

Either Jeff isn't very good with the scissors, or he doesn't know how to cut very thick hair.
I came out of there yesterday, completely dissatisfied with what I had gotten.
Unproperly faded back, bangs not straight, sides uneven.
Went back to get it fixed today, Angel was very good about it.
I would recommend Angel for simple cuts, but I would not go back to Jeff.

The best barber in this store is Angel, he works hard to ensure a great job on all levels!
My father was a barber thus I know and understand what professionals do and provide as far as services go.
Jeff's skills are lackluster at best-probably one of the worst haircuts ever.
I recommend this store but only for the reason that Angel works hard to provide a quality product each and every time.
Thanks to Jeff and his rude attitude I've taken my business elsewhere

No bells & whistles, no attitude.
Friendly, clean, efficient and yes a good old fashioned hair cut.
If your hair is nothing special, you just want it clean cut while spending a little time chit-chatting, then that's the place.

This is not Jeff's barbershop anymore.
Disregard negative reviews.
New owner is Frank.
He redid the place looks more modern, new chairs.
Prices are fair.
I got the straight razor shave for my head.
Hard to find barbers that do straight razor anymore.
Pleasant and relaxing place.

The New owner updated the entire shop.
New chairs, sinks and decor.
They were great.
I took my son there for a haircut before he went to have his team pictures done.
It was quick and a great job too.
The price was right as well.
I can not wait to come back and get a haircut and a shave.
