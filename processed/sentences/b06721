If you want anything vaguely leftist, this is the place to go.
Labor history, environmental science, development, African-American studies, and so forth.
Also, a good deal of history and political science relevant to lefty causes--even some fiction, but I didn't spend any time in that section.

An excellent bookstore and a community resource.
Of special note is the collection of Harvey Goldberg lectures-these are a must have for history buffs.
The staff is knowledgeable and accessible.
Some of them have even made history in Madison, written books, or both.

I started picking up books here for class, and began to really appreciate their other selections.
Certainly not a place to look for Sarah Palin's autobiography - plus one star for that.
They've also got a cool rack of zines and a bunch of bumper stickers as well.

Need a cola flavored lollipop of Lenin's face?
If so, this is the store for you.
They also sell other things here, such as books.
That primitive form of TV we all used to know and love.
This is a goldmine of leftist reading materials and they have everything from vegan cookbooks, to labor history books (even ones by my fellow Pilsen resident Kari Lydersen!
) , to kids books about the food chain.
They also have artsy books, zines, and a fairly extensive sale section.
Boyfriend even managed to find a replacement for a stolen kaffiyeh here.
The guy running the shop is great.
The sale section was still a little rich for my blood.
Why are all the good ones still $15?
Nuts.
Oh well, this is what happens when you usually shop thrift.
At least you can suck on Lenin's face while pouting over it.

Everytime I'm in Madison I make a stop at this place for some quality reading material.
While it's no Citylights or Mayday books it does have good progresive literature at reasonable prices.
Also love the cat that hangs out there.
I like that they take CC's as some of the more leftist places in the country don't.
