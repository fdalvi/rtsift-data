Okay I have admit that I don't personally get my hair cut (anymore ...I'm bald) but my son and friends have gotten theirs cut here and the manager is so awesome & friendly, I would recommend them to even more of my friends (if I had any).
So friend me, and I'll mention that you should go see these girls ...did I mention that they're awesome?

When in Scottsdale I get my hair cut here.
It is convenient to our place.
I have been a customer of Supercuts for almost 30 years, mostly in Portland but also in Seatac, WA, and Burlington, VT.  Staff changes but service remains the same.
I like what they do.
The price is right.

I love this place.
The stylists are awesome, especially Halla.
It's so convenient, right near my local Fry's Food store and right next to Papa Murphy's.
They recently changed the way that they take customers, though.
No longer call ahead the day of, now we need to call an hour ahead.
