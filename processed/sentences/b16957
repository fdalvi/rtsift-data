One of my favorite places to shop.
They have high end clothes for good prices.
The selection could be better, but it is decent.
They also have home goods too.
This is usually the first place I go to shop for clothes.

Good place for amazing deals on high-quality  name brand clothing, business clothing, and dress shoes.
Has a decent selection of housewares too...  Have to check out Changing Hands Bookstore next door whenever you visit too.

Steinmart, smeishmart...its just meh.
I'm always fascinated by the vision of the clothing buyer.
The colors are outrageous for the women's wear.
Vivid pink, bright green, yellows - If Easter was a 40 year old woman taking a bahamas cruise, she would shop here.
The quality of the clothes are decent, even good but they are always brands you've never heard of.
On occasion, it will be a ellen tracy, but mostly quality by brands that you won't recognize.
That being said, I can usually find a skirt or a shirt that is a good quality and price.
The selection of purses, accessories and shoes are really pretty good.
You will find discounted Nine West, Bandolinos, Anne Klein - not bad.
The housewares are also nice quality.
Ralph Luaren, Tommy Bahama and similar quality.

When I brought my item to the register it did not ring up at 30% off.
I told the sales clerk it had a sign that said it was on sale.
We went to the rack and it did have a sign that said 30% off and it was facing the rack with 10+ of the article I took on it.
She said it was a mistake and there was nothing she could do about it.
This is not the first time I have had this happen at Stein Mart and the sales clerks are never nice about it.
Items frequently ring up wrong and it is frustrating.
I won't be going back to this location.
