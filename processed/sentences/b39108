Devin takes amazing pictures!!!
My wife and I use our camera all the time to take pictures of our family, but seeing Devin's photos reminded me there is a whole other level of photography.
The pictures we received were absolutely beautiful.

Devin took my engagement pictures and I could not have been happier.
My husband, then fiance, had a general theme for what we wanted for our pictures and Devin took it and ran with it and he made it 10x better then I could have ever expected!
I love his work.

Devin took pictures of our business when we first opened and the unique images he captured really helped boost our business by putting a face to the name SoZo Coffee.
He also developed some of our print/logo work and was very flexible and easy to work with, especially since we came to him with a blank canvas and tweeked our ideas along the way.
Devin was able to capture the life and movement of the business and we are grateful for the committed and timely creativity and kind professionalism.

Devin is so professional and easy to work with.
He's patient and clearly understands the importance of really listening to the client in order to ensure that the end result is exactly what they were looking for!
That was my experience and as a result I recommend him to friends every chance I get.
