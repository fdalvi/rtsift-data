Great value for pizza.
Clean looking store and amicable staff.
Taste better than frozen pizza and most carry out.
The other review is a joke and not helpful at all.

Perfectly okay pizza

The best pizza I have ever had, the chicken bacon artichoke delight is to die for.
The staff there is already friendly , fast and the place is clean.

Pretty good service and the pizza is a great value.
We are happy with this location.

Pizza is what you should expect from Papa Murphy's.
Staff is not.
Call in to order they sound like they dont want to talk to you or be there.
Ordered a pizza wanted a second but they didnt care.
Just wanted to know when I would pick it up.
Gave them 45 minutes.
When I arrived I had to wait an additional 20 minutes and I arrived when I said I would.
THe staff just doesnt care.
