I went to this Dr. De Andrade for some sensitivity on one of my tooth.
His office staff is very very rude.
Once I was there he tried to sell me $2000 worth of surgery I did not need after I got a second opinion.

The only interest DeAndrade has is in your insurance coverage..A lousy, rude office staff who equally doesn't give a crap about you..DeAndrade keeps you waiting in the chair for 40 minutes because he is so busy selling his procedures to potential clients sitting in his other rooms.
If you have rotten gums, that doesn't mean you go to a rotten dentist..If you use DeAndrade you indeed have found a rotten dentist.
Avoid at all costs.

I had work done by him.
He is crude and disgusting at best.
After he had my cash in his pocket, his whole attitude changed.
He could have cared less.
Typical Vegas type.
Do yourself a huge favor ......avoid him at all costs.
