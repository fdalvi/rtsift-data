I suppose if you like quilting you will find enjoyment here.
Lots of supplies for people in this type of hobby and it's not very busy so you don't have to worry about long lines.

The store has moved from it's original location.
The fabric selection and store are much smaller :(

I shopped at the 32nd Street store a couple of times - i have shopped at the Thunderbird location many, many times.
The new owners are extremely friendly, helpful, knowledgeable.
The fabric lines offered are of top quality - Moda, Haufmann, Batiks - can't do much better than that!
The notions area is smallish, but they are willing to order what you want.
What I especially like about Quiltz is the intimacy of the store - they let you browse and touch without someone hovering.
Maybe this says it all: I have to drive 45 minutes to Quiltz and I look forward to my destination.
