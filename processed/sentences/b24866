Great location.
I like that it's carpeted.

This CVS is conveniently located on the corner, so it's great for any forgotten items you need to get on the way home.
They sell liquor, have a prescription drive thru, and are open 24 hours!

I love this CVS.
I get all my Rx's here (unless their out of my meds) and shop here quite often especially for the coupon sales items.
The store is always nice and clean.
The people who work there are very friendly and helpful.
The only reason I give it 4 stars is because they have one cashier who is extremely irritating.
He is extremely slow and makes transactions difficult especially if you have a return (even with the receipt).
I try to go to another cashier but they usually only have one line open.
