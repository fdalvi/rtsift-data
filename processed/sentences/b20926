This chippy has been run by the same family since 1967.
It's fish and chips are excellent and it also sells kebabs and pizza.
There's always a queue but don't let that put you off.
There's usually a staff of about 10 people behind the counter so queues don't last long.
Their prices are the same as anywhere else and they deliver.

A great chippie with the most friendly owners.
Never had a bad meal yet.
Highly recommended.

Fish and chips are always fabulous, and the pizza is delish!
Lots of other yummy goodies, kebabs, pies, etc.
but the owners absolutely make the visit!
Every time we're in Scotland visiting from the US, we make a point to visit Giovannis and they remember my dad every time we're there!
Last visit they actually sent us off with a jug of their delicious brown sauce and a Giovanni's shirt!
Absolutely the warmest place to stop in for a quick bite!
