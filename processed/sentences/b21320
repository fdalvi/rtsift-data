I dunt know, i liked it.
Hardly best Chinese i had by a long mile, but something that you get at the fast food setting and comes out of the tray... You know - It was not bad.
There was some flavor.
And it was not grease, which is huge with me.
Good stuff!!

I don't think I have eaten at a Panda Express since high school.
I don't think I need to go back unless I am in fact with someone in high school.
Needing to grab something quick and get back to a hectic Monday at the office I was lured in by the drive thru... My food was edible, but very oily, lacking in any kind of distiguishable flavor and the meat was fatty.
On the up side my fortune cookie was tasty and entertaining.
But, if you want quick "Chinese" in the area, be slightly less lazy, get out of your car and go in to the Tokyo Express down the street.

Who can abstain from visiting Panda Express every now and again?
Most people, but not me.
I need my Chinese food fix every few weeks.
And no other place fills that craving better than Panda Express because there just don't seem to be any other descent Chinese restaurants.
Most Chinese restaurants in Phoenix are terrible with a capital "s", "u", "c", "k", "s".
Panda Express fills the void by offering descent, fast food fare with easy to order combinations.
The Kung Pao actually comes with chili peppers making it spicy and there aren't those large flat misshaped pieces of meat loosely referred to as chicken.
And who doesn't love pandas?
I get the up sale every time just in case the two option plate isn't going to be enough that day.
Or maybe I've just grown too thin like most Americans.
In any case, if you find yourself in Phoenix and that dilapidated Chinese restaurant store front staring you down doesn't look inviting, Panda Express is always just around the corner.

Came here today to get lunch to go.
They were busy ,but not much waiting time .
They are very well organized.
The food just did not look so appetizing though.
I did get 2 orders to go beef and broccoli and Orange Chicken.
It actually tasted better than it looked.
The Choices for sides are noodles, which looked over cooked, fried rice , or white rice.
I choose the fried rice.
Not too bad though i know it is loaded with too many calories.
But, i was working hard today so i will burn it off.
I also got pot stickers and egg rolls both good.
Lots of easy parking in the lot, and they have a drive thru.

I'm still checking out the area around my job looking for fast lunch time eats, and this time I was craving noodles, chicken & pineapple, yes I know it's a strange craving, but it's one I knew Panda could satisfy!
Coworker and I got there at high noon on a Friday and there wasn't a line in site, guess we are ahead of the lunch rush, which was fine by me.
I ordered a 2 item combo with chow mein , firecracker chicken breast & sweet fire chicken breast.
I have to say the sweet fire chicken breast is my all-time favorite; I have tried many times at home to recreate that flavor!
Just delish!
I have to say that customer service was nice and friendly, and if you don't want to get out of your car, they have a drive thru too!
I still have many places to try out for a fast lunch time eat, but I know when I have a craving for sweet fire chicken Panda is right there for me to run to!

The food at this Panda Express is fine but the rice?
Not so good.
They can never get it right.
I've been coming here for awhile but the rice is always undercooked.
Come on if this is an Asian restaurant, you have to at least cook the rice right.
Some days it's edible and some days it's so hard it's almost raw.
I would give it 4 stars because they have great service but because of the undercooked rice I give it one star.

Service & Food here NOT GOOD!
(and that's an understatement)  The very few times I have been here the employees don't seem to speak very clear english.
I have to repeat myself several times before my order is understood.
Then the people behind the counter are rude, they don't seem to care about being polite, and have a "getto" type of attitude with customers.
Instead of "Welcome" or " how can I help you" it's "whaddu want" or " what u geddin?
" If you ask about anything other than what is on the board like TV specials or special items - they have NO clue what you are talking about, and will stand their and look puzzled, then they will just tell you NO.
Worse Panda Express experience ever..
I will not go back to this location, I will go to the other location in Chandler....   Word to the Manager - Teach your Employees that Customers Service is #1 Priority.. Maybe even have them smile once in awhile, and say "hello" and "thank you sir/ma'am" would be nice...instead of the "getto-fab" attitude.
