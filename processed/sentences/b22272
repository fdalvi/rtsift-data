I came here for Breakfast on Saturday Morning, and had a pretty good experience.
I was there early, around 9 am, and was happy to see that there was not a wait to be seated.
The place was busy, but not chaotic busy, which is good.
My server was fine, but I felt that she was a bit overwhelmed.
I will give her the benefit of the doubt on this one.
I think she probably just had a lot of tables, and it took her a while to get to me.
Nothing horrible, but maybe it was slower then expected for what I would have expected.
I ended up getting a garden omelette, which came with a side of pancakes.
Tasty!
I also like how they have different syrup flavors.
Yum yum.
I would eat here again, and enjoyed myself.
Go IHOP!

Oh, the brilliance of being right next to the Park and Ride for the light rail!
What more could a dance weary traveler desire than a nice pile of pancakes to soak up the alcohol in their stomach?
It's an IHOP, so I know what I want before I walk in the door.
That being said, this one always has good service, even at 3 am when 17 rowdy drunks walk in from the train.
I do recall telling our server she could "punch any of us in the face if we get out of line" but she never resorted to it.
She got our coffee and waters fast and right, and then the same for the food.
She even stood at the register and split the bill about 14 ways.

I drove by this location on April 5, 2011 and saw that the restaurant has been closed.
All of the signs were off of the building.

How, oh how could this IHOP close, with premium placement next to the lightrail?
