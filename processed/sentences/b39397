As a hardcore Yelper, I find it a responsibility to place a park or business on Yelp if there is no listing.
When I was walking in Southern Highlands back on July 13, I saw that Jimmy Pettyjohn was not on Yelp.
It is now and Lavi.
S has reviewed it.
Jimmy Pettyjohn Park is a 1.09 acre park in Southern Highlands at the northeast corner of Southern Highlands Parkway at Valley View Boulevard.
It is a park serving the local community.
It does a good job at this.
It is fully gated, which is a good thing if you have little children.
There is a state-of-of-the-art shaded playground, shaded gazebo, green grass,  rest rooms, and attractive preipheral landscaping.
In the summer, Jimmy Pettyjohn Jr. Park features night time movies.
When I rate community/neighborhood parks, I rate them differently than regional parks.
Due to the tiny size, I am very picky.
I look at the condition of the grass and equipment,  connectivity to adjacent land uses, and surrounding area.
Jimmy Pettyjohn Park scored well on all of the above.
The grass is a perfect shade of green.
The playground, gazebo, picnic tables, and equipment were in prime condition.
Although there is a need for a parking lot, the park connects nicely with the Southern Highlands community.
On my visit, it was part of a hike that included the Paseo Walking Path.
And the surrounding neighborhood appears to be safe with graffiti being relatively nonexistent.
I am impressed with Jimmy Pettyjohn Jr. Park.
However, I will not drive out of my way to Southern Highlands to visit it.
It is a park that functions more as a community green space for Southern Highlands residents instead of Yelpers such as myself that reside in another part of the valley.

This park is one of my favorites in Southern Highlands.
It is extremely quiet, secluded, and beautifully maintained.
They have a great variety of things to do.
They also have an outdoor movie show in the summer!
