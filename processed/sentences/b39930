Run!
Run Far Away!
This place is a hovel at best.
There are bugs everywhere and then there is construction throughout so that it is impossible to sleep past 6:30 am.
Not to mention that they shut off the air and water at random.
Not to mention that you will pay more than the rooms are actually worth.
Even though they are renovating they have left in the popcorn ceiling which may contain white fiber asbestos.
Ugh.
Additionally, do not expect the staff or property manager to help you.
They damaged my brand new bed due to their negligence during renovations and refuse to pay out, so I hope you have renters if you actually live here.
Take your money and go to a place like Cabana or Rancho Murietta instead.

The Mark is a great place to live!
Honestly, I was a bit skeptical due to some things I've heard, but as soon as I came to check it out, I realized they're doing some awesome things to make this place great.
They're remodeling it and really making it into an awesome place to live.
It's under new ownership who's ponying up the dough to make this place sweet!

NO!
I've been here since 2012.
I admit to staying cause they were cheap for what you got.
The whole time I've had to have my own exterminator come in.
Who by the way worked.
This place is full of infestations.
The staff is incompetent at best.
Any work orders for maintenance are ignored.
I have had to do most of the repairs myself, if I cared to have them done.
I have an old unit and have seen the new ones...not worth it at all.
The price is going up almost twice what it was, and for basically no more than a coat of paint.
lol.
It's a shithole.
If you've a choice, go somewhere else.
