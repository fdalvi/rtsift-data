This place is pretty cool and all...$450 for an unfurnished studio,and $500 for a furnished utilities included..plus they have rent a cops..yaaaaa to the rescue right?...right?.....

The units come pre-equiped with pets "Roaches".
Stay away if you don't want to get shot!

I stayed in a 2 bedroom apt.
It was spacious especially for the price.
However the neighbor is insanely crazy.
Kids run around all hours of the night, you hear gunshots from time to time, my car was keyed, kids ran up and down my stairs daily, they had no supervision, they had roaches, and management continuously lie.
I'm glad I got me and my family out alive.
