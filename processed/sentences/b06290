At one point in late 2009, I was going to this location at least twice a week for a month.
It was not good for my wallet or my health, but my taste buds were not complaining.
This Taco Bell has great customer service.
The employees work really hard to get your food out to you in a timely manner.
I get out of here so quick via drive-thru that I don't even remember paying sometimes.
I always order off of their value menu.
The Frutista Freeze slushies taste really, really good.
This location is awesome!

Taco Bell.....my favorite place to grab a quick bite when I'm short on cash in the wallet.
My Son enjoys a bunch of menu items here, but I'm a simple guy.
90% of the time I get 2 Bean Burritos, sometimes I order a 7 Layer Burrito.
This location always has fresh ingredients and always has quick, accurate service.
It's nestled between Sun City Summerlin (which is a retirement community) and the original Summerlin, which is a little over 20 yrs old.....so there's rarely a long line or wait here.
Will I return?
I'm sure I will.

I am addicted right now.
Everything is always quick and good.
The girls love the cheese rolls and the chicken burrito and I second that, so we can literally eat for four for like eight bucks, really??
I know it can not be good for us but well worth it on occasion.
Most importantly, what we always notice is how great the employees are.
Always happy and ready to help you out!
That is awesome!
Has anyone else noticed how small Taco Bells little sauce packets have gotten though?
I always have to ask for extras because they just do not have the coverage they use to.
Again thank you to the employees for always giving me a large hand full of extra packets!
You guys rock!

okay so I love Taco Bell but today was the worst customer service ever...I go through the drive thru and order my steak cantina bowl...then I'm asked if I would like to donate and I politely say that I already have...well then I hear in the back ground "she's lying" how rude...thank goodness I had taken a pic of my donation cause I used a silly name...I get to the window and tell the cashier she's very rude for calling me a liar an show her my pic that I donated...she looked at me and said "we'll that wasn't here" seriously does it matter which Taco Bell I donated at?
I just smiled said thanks I will just talk to the customer service rep since you obviously don't have good customer service skills an drive off...now I'm hungry an pissed bad combo!!!
