Nice enough folks, no street bikes or street gear, so if that is your genre skip this place.
On the other hand, if you are into motocross and 4 wheelers, you will find plenty to choose from.

Great gang, their off road knowledge and selection for either 2 or 4 wheel fans is second to none!
By far the best KTM selection in the Valley.
