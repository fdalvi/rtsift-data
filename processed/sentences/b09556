Do we have a complete lack of intelligence here?
It's not rocket science.
I was totally unimpressed with this location, but I did end up with a GREAT funny story to re-tell over and over.
Math is not the strength of our future youth that work here, tried to explain twice and still got no where.
I hope you have better luck... and maybe better review of this dive

I never get food here, I always just get drinks.
Never had a problem with service or waits.
Can't comment on food though.

I would not recommend this Sonic to anyone.
I have only been here twice, but both times it was bad.
The first time my hamburger was served on a stale bun with the meat over cooked.
The next visit my onion rings were all in a clump and under cooked.
Please stay away.
