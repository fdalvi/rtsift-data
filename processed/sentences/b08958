Understaffed in reception area, and the woman that was working up front was not helpful.
Took me multiple calls to get directions (even though I was out front....office is tucked into corner of shopping center and had delivery truck out in front....) I couldn't even get simple directions and then they verbally blamed me once I did arrive for late appointment).
The place seemed clean and I can't speak negative of the Dr.
But, until they get a functional front office staff, good luck to them.
I wouldn't go back and would not refer anybody to them.
An unhelpful and rude reception is not the way to treat customers.

We love Dr. Howard and his staff.
I make the half hour drove up here because we trust him to do what's best but not at unnecessary expense.
Reagan has a level of comfort with him than I've not witnessed with any other veterinarians.
As an added bonus they have a groomer so I can get her nails clipped at the same time.
Totally worth the $12 to avoid that stress for both of us.
Leave it to the experts, and let your dog blame someone else!
