WORST.
RESTAURANT.
EVER.
Mediocre atmosphere (at best), 1/4" thick (at most!
) tv-dinner "ribeye",  frozen corn, probably frozen prepared potato, and to say it had a tv-dinner flavor would be a compliment.
We picked up McDonald's on the way home, seriously.

I have had many different experiences in little restaurants that are kitchy and just off the main road.
Sometimes they are awesome.
This one, not so much.
The service was fine and the decor was expectedly kitchy, however the food...was just bland.
My sandwich might have been the spiciest thing on the menu, Sarah had enchiladas which were sooo bland it was kind of a shock.
Not sure if there how there would be a lack of good Mexican food here in Occupied Mexico, I can only imagine it has something to do with the giant 'anti-Obama' signs just down the road.
Oh well, lickily there are other good places to eat in Wickenburg.
I did hear another couple discussing how good the prime rib was.
It is prime rib though..how difficult is that?

This place is a cool old bar.
The staff was friendly and the beer was cold but the food is very average.
We recently stopped in and ordered ribeye steak.
The steak was okay but not good or great.
For the price, it was very thin, maybe a half inch thick at the most.
I would expect more for the money.
I would eat here again, but probably not before I try other restaurants in town first.
