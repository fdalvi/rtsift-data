This Circle K has some of the best gasoline prices in the area and the convenience store is well stocked.
I come here two or three times a month and the folks behind the counter are always nice.
WOW!

Again like my other reviews, it's a liqueur store.
You can find what you need here.
I'll say this, it's a little smaller compared to some of the bigger newer ones throughout the Valley.
But it serves it purpose.
