I cry when I fill up.

Quicktrip is always my first choice for gas and convenience items.
The staff are well trained and the facilities are always spotless.
I like that it takes all of 3 seconds to check out and every customer is welcomed when they enter.
They have an exceptional assortment of convenience foods from hot dogs to raw almonds.
They also carry a great selection of beverages.

Gas is $ 3.11 today here This Quiktrip is pretty West in the valley just off of Grand Ave the 101 freeway pretty nice staff very clean Store and gas prices seem to go up and down a lot but always a reasonable price.

Has is $ 3.11 here today.
Not bad.
Pretty decent price on gas for this quick  being one block from the on and off ramp of the 101 there is a low 's, BurgerKing, $.99 store and McDonald's and golds gym on the same road.
