I love Carvel ice cream.
Growing up on the East Coast, Carvel was our go -to ice cream place.
However, after living on the West Coast for many years, I went without Carvel for a long time.
Boy was I happy when I first saw Carvel in the C terminal of McCarran.
The soft serve ice cream is just wonderful.
Will I be back?
Heck yeah!

The ice cream Sunday I got was tasty but the service was poor.
They were out of vanilla, the cash register wasn't working and I got the feeling that the cashier didn't want to help me.

Pretty average ice cream.
The said, you drop extra Reeses Cups in dirt it would taste good.

So what does he want for dinner but ice cream.
It's okay, we are adults and stuck in a Las Vegas airport, so it actually makes sense.
He ordered a soft serve ice cream in a cup with butterfinger like crumbles everywhere.
Whatever makes you happy...
