First time I came in here 3 years ago, they greeted me as I walked in.
I have been treated exactly the same for the same 3 years.
I am a regular and I always have one specific person cut my hair  hair and it's great to have conversation with the hair stylist.
I normally show/ let them know what I want for my hair and they give me their input and what would be the best for your hair... regarding it's health and what you should/could do.
You don't HAVE to make an appointment, but preferrably you should.
Mainly cause they don't want you to wait too long.

My whole family probably get their hair cut here.
Wendy is the person you need to look for.
Any hair style, combover, punky, spikey, long hair, whatsoever.
She does all of them.
She's been my hair dresser for the past 7 years till now.
Never let anyone touch my hair.
Guaranteed trusted and will recommend to everyone!!!
Bring a picture too and she can do it.
Done it to my son and now he has combovers lol really chill place and friendly atmosphere.
Walk-in is welcome too.
A+!!
