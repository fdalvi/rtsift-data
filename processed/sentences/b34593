Bronze catered my temple's community Passover seder on April 7 for over 70 people and did an outstanding job.
The service was friendly and very efficient for this large crowd, nobody felt they were waiting too long to be served.
The salmon was cooked just right (also amazing for 70 people), as were the veggies.
The soup included three matzah balls with just the right texture (not too hard or soft), two of which were flavored (spinach and tomato), a first for me.
Those who had the vegetarian option (spinach and quinoa patty) at my table were also very pleased.
I highly recommend them for your next event.

Chef Peter is an outstanding caterer and did a marvelous job catering a Friday evening Mediterranean dinner at Beth Chayim Chadashim and the second sedar night.
Knowing how terrific they are, I will use them for my own parties and recommend them to all my colleagues, friends and family.

Truly amazing!
Bronze Fine Foods & Catering catered my wife's baby shower.
It was honestly one of the best catered culinary experiences we've ever had.
Truly!
I loved it so much I told the caterers they had to get on Yelp so I can write a review... and well, here we are!
Over the years, I've hired many caterers for corporate events and live event productions.
I've sampled many of LA's finest caterers and can honestly say they don't get better.
The service is superb (you'll never feel more taken care of).
The styling of the food is so good you'll be taking photos and pinning them to every pinterest board you can.
And of course... the food is AMAZING!
Can't say enough great things.
The chef has studied under some of the best in the industry (e.g.
Patina Group, Mario Batali's Mozza) and his quality of food and recipes are as good or better than anything you'd order in those restaurants.
Highly, highly recommend you reach out to the for your next event!
