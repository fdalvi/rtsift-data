This Banana Republic, the one inside Fashion Show Mall, is supposed to be some sort of special design.
As an article describing the store puts it, it is "designed like a walk-in closet with a residential feel.
"  Huh?
It just feels claustrophobic to me.
The clothes are in hallways in no discernible order.
But they do have some cute stuff on occasion that my neighborhood store does not have.
The salespeople here have been less enthusiastic here, in my experience.
They have never checked in on me while I've been in the dressing room (but they've left them unlocked, at least, so I can get in).
They also tend to focus on the negative.
For example, the Luxe club, their frequent buyer club where you have to spend $800 per year.
You can get free alterations, but the salespeople I've talked to about it start with all the damn rules - basic alterations only, no cuffs, no lining, thread may not match the clothing.
Whaa?
Returns have been a pain in ass here, too, in my experience.
If you buy with a rewards certificate, you can't get the rewards certificate back on a return unless you are in the Luxe club.
You can't use gift certificates and reward certificates together.
Too many rules!
And I don't even know if those are the rules... it's just what the people in this particular store have told me.
I like to pop in every so often to see if there is something cute.
I have gotten some of my favorite clothes here, so I'll give it an A-OK.

This is one of the nicest BR's I've seen in terms of store design and layout.
The boss is a big BR fan and cannot resist stopping when he sees one, so I've been in a lot of them.
This location gives equal space to men and women, and has sectioned off the store into "boxes" where clothes of similar style and color are displayed.
This makes it easy to find what you want easily.
This location also has a really nice shoe/accessory area toward the rear of the store - that's also where the sale racks are located.
Employees here were above average in terms of helpfulness.
