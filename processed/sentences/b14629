Had to find a new powder coater since my usual place went out of business recently.
After a lot of checking a round I ended up here.
Glad I did.
Great work, fair price & quick turn around.

I had to get two large pieces coated in less than a week.
My normal powder coater was backed up for 3 weeks.
I called Vyne after a recommendation from another shop.
These guys did a fantastic job; on time and on budget..
I'll defiinitely hit them up again.

Had the guys at Vyne do a a large hoop for a table I was building, it came out great, and they got it done in three days.
I discovered they have a $75 minimum, which I thought was a bit steep for what it was, but I am still happy with their work.

These guys do a great job on time.
We use them constantly for our in house manufactured products and they are consistant in color and quality every time.

Wow,  what an amazing job they did!!
I had an old Bistro set that looked so bad and they made it look brand new!!
So impressed!!
Very nice owner and employees,  will use them again.

Everyone was so nice and they are great people.
Thanks again for turning my old metal clamshell chairs into something beautiful.
