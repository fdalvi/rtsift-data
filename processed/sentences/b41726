Absolutely fantastic!
The spicy gyros was absolutely amazing and everything tasted so fresh!
The diverse menu was an absolute plus because it seems like they want to reach all of the crowds!
Definitely going back!

Absolutely fantastic!!
The spicy gyros was such a unique, wonderful and delicious idea!

Nice clean restaurant with a good selection of food.
They have all the typical Mediterranean style food but they also have some extras which is nice.
I had the falafel pita which was very good.
The iced tea they have is also good,it has a nice floral flavor and is unsweetened.
I was greeted very well when I came in and taken care of as I ate my meal.
