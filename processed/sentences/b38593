Went in today to get my eyebrows threaded, and honestly she did horrible.
I think her name is Ramila.
I get my eyebrows threaded all the time in Arizona Mills Mall, and they always do such a awesome job.
So I googled threading places in Phoenix, and this one seemed perfect!
It was very close to my house too, so I said why not and tried it out.
She took too much hair on the ends, and both of my eyebrows aren't even.
Very nice girl, but not very good at eyebrow threading.
I won't be coming back.

I have been looking for a great threading place in the Phoenix area for a while now but was unhappy with other salons I went to.
I drove past one day and decided to give Hollywood a try.
I was so happy with the outcome, the woman who did my eyebrows really listened to me and my eyebrows looked perfect.
They also have good prices.
I would recommend Hollywood to everyone.
They are great!

I found this place on groupon.
Great deal for full face threading.
The lady here did such an awesome job on my whole face and was so fast!
I am definitely coming back.

I absolutely love this place they do an amazing job.
I've gotten the same lady every single time and she is a very pleasant woman.
One time her credit card machine was not working and I rarely carry cash on me and she was willing to let me go & just pay the next time i come in..
I was blown away that she would trust me to even come back and pay my next time around..
I went & took cash out of the ATM returned to pay her.
I love that this place is on the south side & exceeds my expectations!!
Def my to go to threading place!

I really like this shop they are cheap, fast and accurate.
Plus you don't need an appointment like my treading shop in Scottsdale.
Glad my mom lives in the neighborhood.
