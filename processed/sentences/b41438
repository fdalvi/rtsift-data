It's an exhibition - it's a party - it's a wonderland it's all of these things.
And more.
Every year Edinburgh's art scene opens the Vaults on Market Street and turn them into a world of its own.
Sculpture, Fine Art, film, music, installation art and performances will take hold of you as soon as you step in.
You will forget your everyday life for a couple of hours and feel like floating in a creative aquarium.
I forgot that I was still in Edinburgh.
the tickets at 10- 15 Pounds seem expensive but you'll be able to see several bands and DJ's and judging from their Opening Night yesterday, it's spectacular and I would (and will) happily spend it again.
And they are a charitable fund!
Oh and if you are too busy at night: the exhibition Vaults are open during the day - for free.

This is quite surreal and fun installation art.
Love it and recommend you get down here, as only on for one week .

Art and very good Art it is.
You forget these Vaults quite easily on Market Street as they just merge into the city backdrop.
They don't get used like this so it's a great way to use a space and i hope it's the start of something special for artists.
The musty vaults host a series of arts and entertainment.
I fell in love with two particular artist's work - David Martin and Miriam Mallalieu apart from the bit where I  almost crapped myself going into Miriam Mallalieu's "Charnel House for Roadkill"!!
We went in the daytime so know real entertainment to hear, but to see there were plenty of cool artists!
