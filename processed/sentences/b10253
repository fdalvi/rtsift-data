One of the worst flower delivery services ever.
Won't ever do business there again.
I understand it was Valentine's Day.
However that should've been more reason to have more than 2 drivers delivering over 400 sets of flowers to customers!
Paid 75$ for a dozen roses with the vase, and it took way too long (four hours to be exact) for the roses to arrive.
My wife thought I didn't get her roses, and I had to tell her so the element of surprise was gone.
when I called the manager she said she couldn't even call the drivers to see what was taking so long.
One of the worst businesses I've ever encountered in my twenty years in Las Vegas.
They just lost my money and my respect forever.

I had a last minute wedding to do and literally ordered the flowers 2 days before the wedding.
Not to mention the day of I had to add a small bouquet.
The staff at Flowerama were amazing and all of the flowers came out beautiful!!
Not to mention the price was affordable and kept me under budget.
I HIGHLY recommend them to everyone I talk to and I will always use them in the future.

This is the first place i think of when i need some flowers.
I used to live near this one so i would use it a lot more.
The prices are solid and the selection is pretty good.
What really keeps me coming back is the outstanding customer service.
Each one of the staff really tries hard to make each experience great and unique whether you are buying a single rose or a whole bouquet.
It would be nice of the shop was a little bit bigger.
Cheers!

They have some beautiful flowers here.
They also deliver ($15 charge).
The lady there (Tree) was very helpful too.
Great customer service :)

I was pleasantly surprised when I received a delivery from my husband of this "Huge Gorgeous Bouquet" he purchased the bouquet from Flowerama and they did a fantastic job, they are Absolutely Beautiful!!!!!!!!
