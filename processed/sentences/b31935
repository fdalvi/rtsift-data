One of the FEW remaining places that do a straight hot shave.
There are other locations of V's around Phoenix who have entertainment guide coupons, this one is the one that doesn't (just my luck of course)

Yelpers,   It's taken me a year to find this place.
Back then, I (wrongly) thought that every haircut was the same, so why not go for the best price??
Trust me when I say that didn't turn out well.
Seriously, I've been to just about every haircut place you can imagine in Scottsdale and this one is by far the best.
Nodari is hair cutting prodigy.
Come here if you're looking for skilled, professional barbers.
Thanks again!

What a great find thanks to previous Yelpers.
This is the best haircut I have had in a very long time.
Hot towel and neck/shoulder massage after my cut.
Wow you can't beat that.
Well worth the couple of extra $.
Wish I had a V"s back home
