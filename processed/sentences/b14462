Worst customer service in pharmacy.
5 people working and takes forever to be acknowledged.
Then they argue with you over your coverage.
I'd just go to Walgreens if my rx coverage would let me.
You should too if you want to actually be helped.

This store is a decent store, although the day I went in there, I was in search of cold medicine and their pharmacy was not open.
They did not have the type of product I was in need of, so I left and went up the road to Walgreen's.

Faye the cashier is one of the most uplifting people in retail I've ever come across.
Seriously every time I'm in there she is so sweet!
I work retail as well so I know how daunting it can be but this girl is so full of life!
Anyway good job CVS for having an awesome employee!
