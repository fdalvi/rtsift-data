Excellent place right across from the airport.
The South side of the airport that is.
Web site needs some improvement.
Ignore the web site because this is a good place to go.
Their machine gun range should be open in about 90 days.
They also sell as well but since I am a CA native I really could not take advantage of this place.
And Until Yelp.com catches up to my business update request,,,  Hours are Tuesday to Saturday, 10:30 AM to 5:30 PM Closed Sun and Mon.
Their web site if you need it: http://www.machinegunkellys.com/

RIP OFF  Kelly Carn - and Machine Gun Kelly's are scam artists.
Kelly Carn has a dozen cases from breach of contract to Felony theft charges.
I have been trying to get my money back since 2008.
He lets you buy a weapon, then submits paperwork.
It never goes through and he avoids giving money back.

OK - I read the other reviews but I have dealt with Machine Gun Kelly's for a while and have had a really good experience with them - they are my favorite gun shop and I am very picky and demanding.
I love them!
They know thier customers by name and thier prices are ridiculously good.
I am in there a lot and I see MANY other happy customers - not just me.
I have been dealing with them for a while as my receiving FFL for online purchases and I have bought guns, ammo, accesories and other items in thier store.
I have found thier operation to be a fun,  family run business and a very interesting store.
It is one of those places that you just have to see or bring a friend to - there is a Tank,  random antiquities,  interesting firearms and something for everyone at Machine Gun Kelly's.
They have been honest,  helpful and very good people to work with.
I have had a great experience,  I have adopted them as my new gun store.
I have done many transactions with them and had no problems.
I think the other reviewers disatisfaction may be due to thier circumstances.
Anyone who is applying for a class 3 weapon will have difficult paperwork - people often have things on thier record that they "forgot" to put on the paperwork or things that slipped thier mind and the paperwork can get delayed for years.
Class 3 is very hard paperwork and many people dont get processed on that - that is not Kelly's fault.
As for the lady with the consignment guns...
I did the exact same thing once myself with a box of guns from a family estate.
I took them to a pawn shop,  they were cruddy old guns.....
I didn't want them and neither did anyone else.
They sat there for a year,  I forgot to pick them up by the end of my consignment contract and the shop never paid me and I couldn't get them back.
NOT the shops fault,  it was my fault - they had the guns,  they tried to sell them,  they didn't sell in my contract time,  I didn't pick them up - MY fault.
The only thing I can fault Machine Gun Kelly's for is that they sometimes open a bit after 11am - thier sign on thier door clearly says 11ish and it is a standing joke with the regulars.
They have a huge store and have to bring out all of the merchandise so I can totally understand why they open at 11ish (most days on time but sometimes its 11:20 or so.... nothing to get bent out of shape about!
)  I love Machine Gun Kelly's - I can get to them easily from either side of town,  they are experts on firearms and can answer any question,  they stock hard to find parts and accesories and they are just fun and nice people.
I give them 5 stars!

MACHINE GUN KELLY - SCAM ARTISTS AND THIEFS  I still cannot get my money back from this guy.
Another person reached out to me and told me this is his standard method of scamming people out of money.
He seems so nice and honest, yet he is a crook.
He gave me a partial refund and has avoiding me for over a year now.
His stuff is overpriced as well.

I bought a Sig Sauer 9mm from Joe.
I was very happy with the service AND the price.
I'll go back for sure.

This is the post from Subguns.com I have made Stay away!
Far far away from these people Still have not received my monies back to date!
Date: 9/25/13 20:09  I made the mistake of purchasing a NFA weapon from the Gun Vault in Vegas owned by Kelly Carn.
It has been 7 months since they have taken my monies and the weapon has yet to be shipped to my NFA dealer.
All I get from these dirt bags is the run around and they will not refund my money or let me speak with Kelly Carn ( the owner ).
Does anyone have a home phone, cell phone, or email for this upstanding person.
Thanks for reading!!!
