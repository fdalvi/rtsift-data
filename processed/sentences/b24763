We use their services at our office in Northern CA.
They send a woman to give us our flu shots every year.
Had no problems with payment or scheduling.
The biggest problem is not crying when someone tries to put a needle in my arm.
I try to tough it out, since I get my flu shot at work, and I don't want to appear weak with my coworkers around... but I usually end up asking to hold someone's hand.
They lose a star for not providing stickers and suckers to us when we're done; like my doctor does when I get a shot.

Worst company ever!!!
Do not use them..totally unreliable and unresponsive.
Do not respond to phone calls or emails.
Shocked they are still in business.
Stay away!!!
