I got lucky choosing this shop, I've found!
I sustained $5000 damage to my 6-week-old Honda Civic after being hit from the rear .
I called the dealership who said this is the body shop they use.
Since then, I've found that I got lucky choosing them, rather than the 'recommended' body shop (Sterling) that my INSURANCE COMPANY OWNS (shouldn't that be illegal??!!).
Sterling tried to get them to straighten and reuse a side panel, which they would not do.
After 6 weeks, I have my car back, looking and driving good as new.
I've heard from others that they are one of the BEST in the Valley.
I highly recommend them.

had to have a little body work done after a knothead backed into me in a parking lot paul at body pro was easy to deal with and had work compleated on time to satisfaction

This place was great to us.
When the insurance agent totaled our car, Body Pro explained what that meant--much better detail than what the insurance agent had.
They explained the that there is difference in payout when you take a salvaged car as opposed to letting the insurance take the car.
They were nice enough to fix the light in our car at a very, very reasonable price.
I will go here again if the need arises.

I brought my BMW 750 LI in after an accident on the highway.
They were informative and did an excellent job repairing my car.
It was completed on time and I can't even tell is was in a wreck.
Thanks!
