Gloria and Sally are he best.They are such a great people.Professionals and passionate with their work.

SALLY!!!
I love her!
I came to her through a referral.
I want a high maintenance orange copper color.
She worked with me to get the exact color I wanted.
I bought $200 extensions that I brought in and she colored them to match.
She colors my black roots without any bleach +++!
Sally also gave me really great suggestions for dry shampoo also shampoo and conditioner.
Allow yourself additional time.
Her prices are also reasonable.
Very happy and I refer all of my friends from Las Vegas and also visitors.
