i have never been to a big lots, but if i'd known this is what they are like, i woulda started going a while back.
they have everything there...and it's so freaking cheap.
some of the furniture was dented and scratched, but for household stuff like towels, napkins, or yard/storage clutter, this was a cool place.
i tried to buy a mirror, but my girlfriend didn't like it so i had to take it back....so hard to please sometimes.....

This is the largest Big Lots I've ever visited, and I've been to several in at least two states.
This particular store has lots of furniture, much of it name-brand, at ver low prices.
Yes, it's great for linens and household items as Travis suggested, but you will be amazed at what else you can find here.
Today I bought an HDMI cable for $12--so glad that I dind't shell out the $65 at Office Max!

I absolutely love big lots.
They have most of anything you are looking for.
All of it for way cheaper than what you would find elsewhere.
You want christmas decorations, body wash, cereal, a couch, picture frames, dvd's?
They have it.
It's never crowded.
The only possible downside could be that they often only have one checkout open, so there might be several people in front of you.
Other than that, this place ROCKS!!
