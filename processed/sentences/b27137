While looking for a deal on good quality furniture for my new condo I was somewhat disappointed in this place.
They have quite a selection and you can't tell any of it has been used, but the prices were higher than what I would expect for consignment, the staff was inattentive, and many bedroom pieces were being sold as a set.

Of course it's hard to review a place on it's inventory when that is constantly changing, but I'm going to do that anyway.
This place is in a practically empty mall, do not let the absence of cars dissuade you.
The decorators who know their stuff were all over this store the day I went.
They have a little bit of everything and everyday it's different.
They have a combination of gently used items and brand new items.
I love the one of a kind items that I found here.
The staff is super friendly and ready to help.
A hint is to ask how long an item has been there, usually if something isn't moving quickly there is some negotiating room on the price, it doesn't hurt to ask.
Definitely will be checking in here from time to time to pick up those unusual pieces that can define a space like nothing else can.

They have a large selection with a variety of types of furnishings....BUTT, their prices were ridiculous.
Nit to mention the two teams two times I have been there not one sales person offered to help me
