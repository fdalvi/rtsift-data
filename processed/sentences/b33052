Warning: Do NOT rent anything from this company!
They tried to pull a bait and switch on me by accepting a reservation for one thing, and then telling me that it was not available--only after I called and two weeks before my party.
They then tried to get me to accept a different product at a higher cost.
They totally disregarded our agreement and sent me scrambling on short notice to find a reputable company to save my kids party.

I absolutely love this party rental company!!
I rent a bouncer with table and chairs from them every party I have.
The kids always love it!
They have a great variety of jumpers, combos, and water slides.
Along with popcorn , cotton candy , and snow cone machines!
I recommend this place to everyone looking to make a party a blast at a very descent cost!
All the employee are very kind and very helpful as well!
Good job CnJ.
Thank you very much!

I had a great experience with this company!
Everyone from the time I booked to the time it was dropped off were very friendly, polite and professional.
It was easy to call and book a reservation.
They gave me a courtesy call before dropping off the bouncer and showed up promptly.
I had the bouncer overnight and they came to pick up early the next morning without me having to be there.
Overall I would definitely use c&j jumpers again!
