Delicious breads, sweet rolls, and now SOUP for lunch too!

I love this little local hometown bakery.
I love stopping and getting a coffee and cream cheese danish.
My husband loves their cinnamon rolls.
The molasses cookies are soft and chewy.
I recommend trying it all!

This is a special hometown place to go.
The best coffee, baked goods and chit chat.
Owners are hard working and very friendly.
I stop in at a minimum of twice a week.
Love it.
