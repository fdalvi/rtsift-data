Hyon is one of the best hair stylist in town.
Sevice is very friendly and price is very cheap.

I have been going to Hyun since she was at Fantastic Sams.
She opened up her own shop and I have been going to her ever since.
I've been going to her for the past few years.
She's very good at what she does, but i'm also a guy who just wants a short haircut so i can't give any feedback on perms or highlights.
It's a clean shop and it's $11.00 for a haircut.
That works for me.

Hyun is the best!!
My whole family has been getting our hair done here for over 6 years.
She is very fast and always remembers how we want our hair to be cut.
Her prices are great and she is so nice.
I will never go anywhere else as long as I live in Vegas.

It was a Sunday I was driving home from work and I desperately needed a trim.
I just happened to notice this hole in the wall hair shop, it's anything BUT fancy!!
When I walked in I was serviced right away and the stylist Hyun cut my hair exactly how I wanted and needed it.
Usually, stylists will say they understand what your requests are but just completely ignore them.
Hyun was honest and super sweet and she made me feel comfortable which is something lacking in many salons.
So I began coming here on a regular basis and I noticed the clientele are predominately male.
The stylists specialize in male cuts but I've completely ignored that fact!
Hyun has always done a great job with my color and cut.
I usually have highlights and touch up along with cut.
Did I mention all hair cuts are only $11.95 not including shampoo & style!!
What I usually get done here cost me around $60-$75 and at another salon will probably be close to $200.
Think about it..
It's a hidden treasure.
