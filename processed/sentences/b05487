A1 gets an A+ from me.
went in a few weeks ago and got the best deal in town on my gold the staff was friendly and helped me out.
i am not very knowledgeable about jewelry and felt like i was not being taken advantage of or belittled in the shop.
i went in today to pick up a ring that i had made for my girlfriend out of a few of my moms old rings and loose stones and it came out AMAZING i am looking into designing myself a ring and in time will return to A-1 to get a possible engagement ring.
i hope that others read this and make the trip to A-1 to experience the same warm customer service and knowledge that i received!!!!
A++++

These people are thieves, stay away if you want to keep your valuables.
I brought two expensive diamond rings in for Romy to redesign and they never called to let me know the rings were ready , I return numerous times and was told they were in the vault and they would call me when they were located, never did.
They kept my property, two rings valued at over $5000.
Stay away, THEIVES.
I will post this everywhere so no one else gets ripped off by these THEIVES

My husband just returned from A-1 to make one final attempt at getting back our rings or at least knowing that they were sold with no accountability by the owners so we have no choice but to press theft charges.
Buyers beware, it is not worth the $$ you save if your pieces are stolen and not returned.

I used A-1 to get great jewelry displays and boxes.
and they also got great jewelry too, plus they can repair most items!
nice staff
