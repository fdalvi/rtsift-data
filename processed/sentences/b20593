Although Matalan is full to bursting with clothes, I usually go for the homeware section.
Crockery and kitchenware are great value.
The selection of household linens are good value and always in this season's on trend colours.
Their luggage is good quality, some of the designs really stand out and you can spot them a mile off on an airport luggage carousel.
Make sure you get your discount card and sign up for the email alerts sometimes they send your discount vouchers.

I used to come here all the time when I was in first year, my dad would take me and I would stock up on jeans, cardigains and tights  - the things you can get away with being cheap.
Although it's cheap, the clothes I've bought here are amongst the longest lasting i've ever had!
I always go for the staple items, but they always have really good fashion items too.
This particular branch is huge but it follows an easy-to-understand pattern in the shop.
it's sort of like ikea, just walk around and you'll find yourself at the till!
Brilliant!
