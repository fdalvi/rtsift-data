Another Great Shop!
The entire store is a walk in Humidor.
Wall to wall selection, special orders, very knowledgeable staff and extremely reasonable prices.

Good selection and very friendly service.

Great staff but dry cigars wasted 20$ on two cigars that are as hard as a rock...very frustrating when you want to end the night with a good stogie

A True Treasure in the East Valley for Cigar Aficionados   Are you tired of those "smoke shops" where the humidor seems like a second thought and is filled with overpriced stock that is past its prime?
Well you're in luck!!
I was returning from my grocery expedition to the Mekong Plaza supermarket and taking Baseline instead of the 60 when I spotted this gem in a non-descriptive location.
A quick u-turn and I was inside ... and immersed in a total humidor!
Old friends greeted me and some new ones.
The woman behind the counter knew her products; what a wonderful surprise!
If you like a good CAO Toro maduro wrapped or one of my standby favorites, Rocky Patel ... whatever your taste, this is the place!!
Enjoy, (and there's a smoking lounge onsite)... enjoy!
