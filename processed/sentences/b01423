Good place to go to pick up a quick dinner.
There's usually a wait for breadsticks- but it's cheaper than even going to McDonalds!
The pizza isn't amazing- but it's okay for $5!

How can you argue with a $5 meal?
There's better pizza out there, but at 3 times the cost.
Definitely the best bet for feeding a family.
I've actually grown fond of their pizza.
They have an online coupon that will get you free sauce your breadsticks.
There's a wait about fifty percent of the time, but it doesn't last more than 3-5 minutes.
Usually it's not because of the employees, it's because some dim-wit at the front of the line can't decide what they want to order...at a place that only has about six different things you can order.

You pay 5 bucks for a large pep pizza and 3 bucks for.crazy bread.
You have aeal for.2 or 3 under 8 bucks.
Its.not the highest quality but for quick amd easy pizza it is a great deal.
I'd rather go here and spend 2 minites inside waiting to pick up my pizza rather than 20 at most other places

What's there not to love about a 5 dollar pizza made ready for pick up?
Mind you, this review is based soley off the hot and ready pizzas, along with their crazy bread.
I must admit I've never ordered their chicken wings, deep dish pizza, etc.
I like that there's a lot of parking at this location, they open at 10:30am and the employees here are always very cheerful an seem to enjoy their jobs.
The crazy bread.... Oh the crazy bread!
This is the best type of breadstick I have vet had.
They are so soft and covered in buttery deliciousness.
I can't resist picking up a bag of these things each time I come in.
The only reason I'm giving this place 4 out of 5 stars is because the "hot and READY" pizzas sometimes aren't ready when you order them.
