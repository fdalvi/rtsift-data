Bijoux Terner is the 99 cent store of "luxury" shopping.
Everything in the store is $10, and they offer a good selection of bags, hats, watches, jewelry, and scarves.
If you promised someone a gift from the casino, this is your best bet.
There are Bijoux Terner locations all over.
This was the best of the New York, New York, shopping that I saw.

I love this place.
I have been to a few of them in Vegas at the casinos when I visit and they have really cute accessories for a great price.
The pashminas are a steal!

I love these stores!
The NY NY one (this one) had the best selection of pashimas - I think during my lst trip to LV, I can say, that I have successfully sussed all of them out, and bought nifty items at each.
The pins, the pashimas.
sun glasses - love all of it!
such a great little place, I picked up my black pash, on our way to dinner, cause I was cold and had forgotten my (much more expensive real) pashima and popped in and grabbed one.
I was so happy I did, and now I take it with me as my travel Pash everywhere, I'm not gonna cry if it gets lost/ruined, and I plan to pick up several more on this next  trip!

I really wish these stores would be available everywhere...but then they wouldn't be as special, right?
I bought a few scarves here that will jazz up my outfits throughout the entire year at $10 each.
$10!!
And the quality isn't that bad.
Great place for cute accessories that will not dent your wallet.

Yes, it's crappy cheap stuff.
But it's CHEAP, and awesome.
You can buy that outrageous yellow metallic bag that isn't worth more than $10.
And when it falls apart 3 months later, you're okay with it.
I always stop here when I head to Vegas...the airport location is my favorite.

Gotta love $10 everything deals!
I always try to stop by whenever I'm in Vegas, I love love love the clutches here.
At $10/each, I can afford to get every color to match with my outfits lol.
The ones I bought, none of them broke down on me yet.
I don't really care for the watches, sunglasses, pashimas, etc offered in this store but whatever floats your boat, as long as you're getting a deal!
