Wow.
I can get fresh produce and everything I need to make awesome Asian noshables--AND fill up my tank at the same time.
I think I'm in love.

I was so happy when this store first opened a few years ago for its location and being the first Asian store to accept credit cards and not being "cash only".
After all these year, the best thing about this store (now that all other Asian stores take credit cards), for me, is their cooked food bar.
Yummy BBQ and roast ducks every day and takeout Chinese dishes by pound Friday to Sunday.
No takeout Chinese restaurant in Madison-Middleton region could possibly beats the price or the quality.
Great grocery item varieties.
Produce is usually fresh -- except you might want to avoid shopping between Sunday and Monday morning when everything just looks leftover-ish.
Meat department is sub par except for occasional live lobsters and crabs; go alternatively for the freezer for frozen meats if you must.
Last but not the least -- Could someone on the management PLEASE tell the female cashier not to "throw" the pen onto the counter but just put it down for the customer to sign their credit card slips?
If I could have a nickel every time she did that to me....
I always went to a different cashier if there was anyone besides her (who seems to be the only full-time cashier).
She hardly smiled back either as if she was always unhappy about something we customers did.

It is interesting to see the person above me mentioned the female cashier who hardly smiles and throws pen/coins on the counter.
I noticed that myself too and so did my husband.
Otherwise, this store is a lot cleaner than Midway and it has great selection of vegetable.

Yes, this store is very well stocked.
Additionally, it is right next to a very good Chinese restaurant - the Imperial Garden.
Very convenient!
