What a great deal!
I would come back to get another haircut

Full service and great pricing!
Haircut and eyebrows in same appointment, very convenient.

Great haircut at a good price.
He was very friendly and welcoming to me and my wife.
I will definitely be going back for my next cut.

Avi has been cutting my hair for the last 8 months and I always leave with a smile.
Not only does he make cutting hair an art, Avi is very flexible, creative and has great vision!
I am always pleasantly surprised by his passion to do his best and his desire to share it with his clients, female and male.
Avi is just awesome!

Avi was very personable.
Love the simplicity and down to earth nature of the neighborhood barber shop.
Being open on Sundays is a plus as well.
This is a great addition to the neighborhood.
Definitely would go again for a Classic men's haircut.

Inexpensive and good in a pinch or a quick lineup, but I'd rather pay a few extra bucks for a full cut.
Avi is a very nice and personable guy.

Love, love, love this place !
Great prices and customer service.
Amazing haircuts for men, women, and children.
And they offer eyebrow threading and waxing!
Superior service all the way around.
Best salon I have been to!
I won't go anywhere else.
