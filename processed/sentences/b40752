Fantastic service and fair pricing.
I went in there with my truck and they steered me in the right direction.
Couldnt be happier with the results

The owner Mark was very helpful explaining which systems would best suit my needs and what all I would need for my car and still stay within my budget.
Great prices, great friendly staff!

I like coming to Wheels Deals.
I originally came her a few months ago for just a sub, and walked out very happy with a sub and sub box installed for a good price.
I'm just an enthusiast sound buff, still learning about Car Audio, but I dig that Mark will let me pick his brain with a million questions, and Raphael will explain to me the best way to set up my truck.
I had them install some gear a few months ago, and about to bump my whole system up, and Mark is going to set aside a whole day for me.
These guys are legit, and the prices are solid too!
Great customer service.
These guys are my "sound guys".
