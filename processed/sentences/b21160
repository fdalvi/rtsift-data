Although I didn't buy anything from Rajah's Supermarket, it was definitely an interesting to shop to just have a look round.
This is the place which stocks all the local Chinese, Indian and Thai takeaways with their (mostly) authentic ingredients.
It feels clean and well stocked with a huge variety of exotic ingredients including sauces, chutneys, a whole range of noodles and rices and many more spices and hebs than I even knew existed.
Their meat is all Halal which means it has been slaughtered and cured in accordance with the traditions of Islam and is, apparantly, cleaner and purer than meat produced by other means.
It did look quite a bit more expensive than the standard meat you can buy at the butcher, but it also looked extremely fresh.
The service in Rajah's Supermarket is friendly and if you're after some exotic ingredients then this is the place to come.

This place is great for a look around - but I advise you do so when you arent hungry, you might end up buying everything.
The thing is this place seems to do a lot of supply for restaurants etc, and as such it has a massive array of all sorts of food - including many spices, meats, vegetables and some of the biggest bags of rice i think the world has ever seen.
The shop itself is large, clean and very well laid out (in my opinion) and the staff are massivly friendly.
I felt it was a little over priced, but that is most likely to reflect the quality of the food, as well as the fact ths place suplies restaurants and isnt really aimed at individuals as much.

I love this place  it looks tiny from the outside but there is a massive stock inside with a large warehouse at the back.
It is so much cheaper to buy dried spices and herbs etc here than at our big supermarkets or Real Foods  and Rajah's give a much greater choice.
If you like cooking Indian food then this is a must.
