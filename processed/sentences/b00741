Good Chinese food.
Very good lunch buffet.
Other than that, your run of the mill Chinese restaurant.
Huge seating area.

I used to drive past here and say, huh, I should go there one day.
It became a joke.
The girlfriend and I would drive past and before I could say anything she's say, "Yea, yea, we're going to go there one day.
"  So we went there.
And....  we most likely won't go back.
It wasn't particularly bad per se, but we've had better.
It was alright, and they had a decent selection, but nothing was really great or stood out to us.
Maybe some day, if we drive past it enough, we'll start up the joke again saying how someday we should give it another shot.
But unless we are hit by some kind of massive Chinese buffet cravings while we're right down the street, I don't think we'll be there any time soon.

Now that this place is under new management it's gotten better.
i went once before and it was kind of nasty, now it's cleaner and has a better selection.
Its hard to find  edible chinese food in Phoenix, this one is one of the better ones now.
I think it's renamed Fuji Buffet.
It even had a sushi bar (not a sushi eater, but it had one) and everything was as fresh as can be expected.
Large shrimp and chicken selection, and pizza and things for the kiddos.
Stay away from the desserts tho', not so great.
