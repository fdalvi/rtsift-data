Excellent product

Desert Palms makes the BEST emu oil products out there.
I've tried other kinds, hers are the best.
I've been pleased with every product I've tried/bought.
But my favorite are the chapstick (all the other chapsticks I've tried ended up drying my lips even more, this chapstick actually makes my skin better) and then my favorite is the Green Relief therapy.
It is really an amazing product.
Great for everything from muscle aches to skin irritations.
I buy the biggest size of Green Relief and we go through it in a couple months.
Also, her products are actually very reasonably priced.
I paid way more for Philosophy products that I felt were of equal, or in some cases lesser, quality as compared to Desert Palms.
It's a bargain at that rate.

Their emu oil is great.
I use it for inflammation of my jaw and shoulders, it's wonderful.
I highly recommend it.
We buy it at Fresh Vitamins in Mesa.
No dyes, fully refined, I love it.
