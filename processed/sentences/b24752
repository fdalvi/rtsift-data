This is a great place to hunt for cool stuff.
I found some great furniture and dress shirts for work the prices were so good I couldn't pass them up.
New stuff everyday and and really cool artwork and frames.

I wonder why the Value Village's have such friendly, helpful staff compared to other thrift stores?
Great prices at the Value Villages in Glendale, by the way!

This location is much better, only 4 1/2 miles from the other location which is horrible (read other review)... how that works I am amazed, the staff is friendlier and the store is in better shape.

Not a fan of this place.
the MOD was really rude and court to me, refusing to sell me something without a price because the people below her that price the products weren't working at the time.
It was a pack of polaroid film, that is probably gone to waste with some child ripping out the exposures from the packet.
I've been to other thrift stores where the MOD would price something, or just give it away if said price employees weren't in store.
Rude service.
0/10 will not recommend.

From time to time I like to stop at thrift shops to see if I can find some special for my home; mostly my garden.
I've found a couple of things at a less expensive price than at the store to be expected.
It's a pretty good size thrift store.
