We went to the Downtown Kitchener Ribfest & Craft Beer Show in July .
It's 1.5 hours from Toronto so we took the train down and back.
This way, we didn't have to fight the traffic on the highways.
Plus, since we knew we'd be drinking beer, we didn't have to worry about driving home.
Admission is free and you pay for what you want.
You buy a glass for $6 (which you take home) and then 5 ounce beer samples are $1 each.
There were seven ribbers and thirteen craft breweries.
When we got there about 1:30, there was a big crowd and line-ups.
When we left about 7:00, the line-ups were huge and there was a fun vibe.
This was the first time we'd been to this fest.
It was a lot of fun and it's definitely on our calendar for next year.

Drove 3 hours in traffic to attend the 2011 Downtown Kitchener Ribfest and Craft Beer Show.
I was not able to sample much of the beer because I was driving, but I did try a few sips from a friend of mine.
I was very impressed by this little festival which ran all weekend long, from Friday to Sunday in Kitchener's Victoria Park.
Just as in the previous year it was free admission and then you could buy a wrist band for $6 which got you a beer glass and 1 token.
Each token after that was $1.
1 token got you a 4oz beer.
My favourite new brew flavour of the event was the Flying Monkeys Smashbomb, which you can get at the LCBO.
I recommend it if you like a nice and flavourful India Pale Ale.
Now for the food.
With so many ribbers to choose from I just went with the recommended Boss Hogs.
They made a pretty mean $7 pulled pork sandwich, and for an extra $2 you got a side of beans and coleslaw.
It was pretty delicious.
The ribs look delicious too, but they were a bit too messy for me!
I look forward to the next Rib and Beer fest next year.

Amazing event, I highly recommend attending!
Good food, good beer, good music!
