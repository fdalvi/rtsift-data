They picked up my documents, and got them to the mortgage company before the promised delivery time.
I would use them again.
Website is easy to use as well.

I searched Yelp to find a local courier and found Coyote Courier Services from Chris W's stellar review.
I ended up using this company today to pick up an envelope and deliver it to my office.
It was $17 for a trip that would've taken me almost two hours round-trip.
I'd say that's worth it!
I called and spoke to Stevie on the phone to set it up.
She was friendly and made the process extremely easy...
I'd definitely use them again.
The only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five is that I requested a receipt be delivered, faxed, or emailed to me.
Originally, I was told they would fax it right after the delivery, but I'm still waiting.

Thank you Coyote Courier.
Just like the speedy Coyote in the cartoons, you came through and saved me time and late charges today!
After an event, I had some lovely black linens to return and needed to do so before end of business day.
I called Coyote in the late morning and crossed my fingers for availability.
Not only was the service incredibly friendly, they also said they could deliver it in time ... and on such short notice too!
While I waited for the associate to tell me how much it would cost, I anticipated many dollar signs considering it was kind of a long drive.
However, it was practically less than the gas it would have cost me to drive there -- only $17!!
I think I have found a new best friend in Coyote Courier and thank you Gabi and Chris W for your great reviews so I knew who to call in a time of delivery need!
