Bought 2 tacos,1 soft 1 hard.
It was Ok, The price is right thats for sure.
$1.06 for two tacos.
its kinda like taco bell but the meat seems a little more suspicious.i wouldn't come back here unless i was broke and hungry or very intoxicated.
taco bell is a better choice

Nothing too elaborate or profound to speak of here.
Above average "fast food" restaurant when you want Mexican food.
Prices are great with many options.

I enjoy Del Tacos Turkey Tacos with extra cheese.
They are low in fat and calories.
The service is always very fast.
I like Mexican food and most sit down Mexican restaurants can't beet Del Taco.
Try a turkey taco today and I think that you will agree with me.
