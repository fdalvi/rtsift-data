2 for 1 car wash. $7.

I don't frequent Green Valley Grocery / Shell Gas Station all that much.
I have stopped here in the past, as it is on my way to my old gym.
It's all about convenience for me at gas stations / mini marts.
The times that I have come here I have paid at the pump.
And, I think that I have entered the store part once or twice for road-trip goodies or ice.
My reason for coming today was to gas up my fathers car that he let me borrow.
Gas seems to be a little more expensive than the place I usually go to.
$3.74 a gallon.
But, what is $.30 cents or so more for a tank of gas?
Like I said, it's all about convenience.
So, as gas stations go... this place is good.

Water stop, pretty convenient, gas prices here a less than spots closer to the strip.
Coffee, water and snacks.
You can get a car wash here as well.
Gas and wash the car get some snacks and back on the freeway..

Every time I stop here, I am accosted by beggars as I pump gas or put air in my tires.
I have complained twice to the clerks; they seem disinterested.
I note the criminals take the dollars they cadge into the store and buy things.
Perhaps that is why management doesn't provide security or call 911.
I will never stop there again.
