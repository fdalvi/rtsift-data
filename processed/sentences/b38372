I generally try to stay away writing low ratings, especially when I've only ordered from a place once.
That said, the stracciatella gelato (my favorite flavor of gelato) was completely flavorless, and I threw most of it out.
Store-bought gelato would have been much better, and maybe they should consider that as an option instead of whatever they're currently doing.
My recommendation would be to get a cold coffee or smoothie to sip on while you're walking around, and skip on the gelato.
I'm giving Zio two stars simply because it's the only place I found serving gelato in Vegas.
Enjoying good gelato on a hot day is one of life's simple pleasures in my book, and the faux-Italy vibe in Vegas combined with the hot desert sun provides a perfect atmosphere for it.
Maybe some of their other flavors taste better, but I'm not likely to try again after my first experience.

There's only a few reviews on this place so I'm guessing it's relatively new.
I'm a huge gelato addict.
My personal favorite is at Illy Espressamente inside The Palazzo which serves Cocolini throughout The Venetian as well.
But after paying $6 for a scoop, I decided to go hunt for somewhere that may be a little cheaper.
Zio Gelato is located in what appears to be a hidden location on the far side of The Venetian in the hallway behind B&B Burger and the Sports Bar.
I got a scoop of the hazelnut which I paid $4.00 (plus tax) for.
Since I had the gelato from Cocolini exactly the night before, I can definitely say that the gelato tasted very comparable.
Since there are a few mixed reviews of this place, I'll just assume that not all their flavors good and they don't have as much variety.
Still - I thought the hazelnut was delicious and a pretty good bang for my buck, at least for Vegas Strip prices.
Servers were also very friendly.

I spent $16 in a frozen pi√±a colada that tastes like cough syrup.
It's impossible to drink, it's awful!!!
Don't waste your money here...
