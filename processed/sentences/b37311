Tammy was wonderful with my fill and shellac polish.
She had a great attention to detail and ensured they looked perfect.
Anne did my pedicure.
I sprung for the reflexology pedicure and was in heaven.
Such a long massage and great detail to ensure my toes look just as good as my fingers.
They have won me over!!!
Definitely come here for quality and friendly service!

I will say they wete definitely thorough....i was there for quite awhile getting a mani/pedi.
Glad i didn't have anywhere to be.
I was nicked twice and bled.
My polish is already chipped and smeared from normal wear...less than 24 hours.
I have a couple big red marks on one leg from too "vigourous" a scrub massage.
My heels are tender from the same over-enthusiasm with the scraper thing.
It was $50 for the mani-pedi....most places offer a deal for the combo and i was very surprised to hear the price.
Bad/Bloody/Expensive....AVOID.

This place is really good.
They pay a lot of attention to the toes, more so than many places.
I've been to the very popular places nearby, and I can't understand the appeal.
I think the staff here do a better job.
Great work, I'll continue to come back!
