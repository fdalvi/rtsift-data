I love Sol Yoga!
The name fits...everyone in this studio is sunny & warm!
Great teachers, beautiful practice room, and a wide variety of classes to choose from.
$60 per month unlimited yoga is a fabulous price.
No parking problems.
Frozen yogurt nearby....just in case.
Clean, cheery, and friendly.

This studio is very well designed, very nice cork floors.
The teachers are great.
They all have anusara training which is what I look for in a yoga teacher.
It's a little hard to find but lucky for me I found it!
You will get a good yoga class if you go there.
They are adding Zumba too which is always fun!
The owner is a very well trained and experienced teacher.

...
I had only been to one class a year ago ... it was not difficult enough ... it's not power yoga ... it's sort of easy going yoga ...
I'm on their email distribution list ... today 8-20-13 received this email:  "It has been truly my honor and privilege as the Owner of Sol Yoga over the last seven months ...
It is with mixed emotions that I inform you that Sol Yoga will be closing its door on September 15th, 2013.
" ... "If your membership has run out - no worries- you may join us for any of our classes until our last day Sunday Sept 15th.
If you would like to make a donation know all of it will go toward the teachers who richly deserve ever penny and a whole lot more.
