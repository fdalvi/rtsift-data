I was in need of an impeller for my pool pump motor.
I went to the local Leslie's and they did not stock this most common part.
They wanted to charge me to have it shipped to the local store.
I had heard the name B & L Pool Supply before and decided to call them.
They not only had the part in stock, but they were less expensive than the "big chain".
The guys at the location on Peoria gave me excellent service and advice.
They wanted to make sure I didn't walk out the door with everything I need to fix this needed repair on my pool.
They even gave my 4 year old son a frisbee just for driving 20+ minutes to get there.
I trusted these guys and made the drive...well worth it!
Go to the B & L Pool Supply near 51st Avenue and Peoria...great service!

Rude service.
I was not satisfied with some products I purchased there, and when I went to return them, the guy at the counter didn't care to hear my concerns.
He just wanted to process the return and get me out the door.
I asked if they had a restroom I could use, he rudely replied "NO!
" and just handed me my paperwork to get me out of his store.
I will never return to this place again!

WORST SERVICE EVER!
The service is OK in the store, but NEVER call them for a repair!
You probably will find  something better in Craiglist.
Repair department is really unprofessional and unfriendly, their priority is send you a bill instead of customer satisfaction.
You will find other reviews here stating the same, so save some time and money and call somebody else for repairs and try Costco or Online stores for supplies.
