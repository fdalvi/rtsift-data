We relocated from San Francisco last year and Paul and Heidi at Mc Cormick Ranch Postal are great.
He is like the Mayor of McCormick Ranch.
Always greets us warmly and holds the mail while we are away.
Heidi even calls us on the cell phone when a package is delivered.
Now this is customer service!
Love these guys!

What a pleasant surprise!!
I had to ship a relatively large framed picture and Paul blew me away with both reasonable pricing (SIGNIFICANTLY less than UPS Store down the street) and friendly, quality service.
His great packing assured that the picture arrived in perfect shape at it's new home in CA!!
Can't beat this 'mom and pop' shop - I'll be back!
