After much searching for an affordable window tint dealer, I was connected to JR.
This guy is nothing but a straight hard-worker who does great quality window tint removal and installation.
A couple months later, I'm a satisfied customer.
He removed the tint off my windows that I was previously warned by a cop for being at 5%.
JR was friendly, professional and excellent when he was able to pull my old tint off and install new, legal 35% tint on.
We had some idle conversation while he worked on it.
One thing to keep note of - he is mobile and comes to you.
If you live in an apartment complex, you may need to have an additional extension cord to help him out so he can use his blowdryer/heat gun to cure the tint.
This guy works so hard, he doesn't have a site or anything like that.
The number on his card is 623-418-1809.

I'm thoroughly satisfied with JR Window Tint.
This is a mobile service, making it very convenient for him to come to your home.
He stripped and reapplied new window tint on my car with precision and care.
He's affordable, professional, and a diligent worker.
It was easy to make an appointment with him, too.

Idk,  this guy is very unprofessional.
He initially said 1 hr for the appointment then rescheduled and then canceled.
He had a very unprofessional demeanor as well.
Idk how he maintains a  legitamate business, i world never do business with such a person!

When I needed to get the windows tinted on my Hyundai Elantra I asked friends for recommendations and also looked on Yelp.
I was impressed by the reviews on a few companies but settled on JR because of his positive attitude and fair quote over the phone.
I got a better deal by taking the car down to his workshop and he had the car finished in around 90 minutes.
They used 35% on the front side windows and windshield, and 20% on all rear windows.
They did a very nice job and it made a major difference to the temperature inside the car.
I am a very happy customer, no reservations.
