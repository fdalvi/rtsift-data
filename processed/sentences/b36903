Brad is the best barber ever.
He has a nice beard.

It took me 10 years to find the right barbershop in this town.
My instructions to my barber was, "cut my hair".
He did a professional job.

Best pompadours are made here!!!!
Ask for ROB, but all the guys there do a great job.
TIP: Please be ready to wait and make sure you know who is ahead of you so no one jumps in before you.
