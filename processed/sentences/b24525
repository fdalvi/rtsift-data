I just started a baking class and we were told that we needed to get a chef's coat.
I heard someone mention a place on 15th st and Mcdowell and figured it couldn't hurt to check it out.
I am so glad that I did.
This is THE place to go if you are a uniformed professional.
You can get firefighter stuff, security stuff, scrubs, and culinary stuff.
They have a wide variety of everything and their prices are VERY fair.
In terms of chef coats, if you are interested, they carry a lot of colors, many styles, and many brands.
You can find something for as low as 15 bucks!
You really can't beat that for high quality uniforms.
Keep this place in mind if you need a uniform for work...or play.

Very helpful & accommodating!
Went in for shoes & socks; left with a free pair of socks & an additional discount for my place of employment.
Will definitely return!
