We were referred by our realtor to this company when we needed a plumber within one week of moving into our new home.
Steve was very courteous on the phone, and apologized for not being able to come out that evening ( it was 3ish when we called) but would be out the next morning first thing.
He called the next morning to make sure it was ok to come out.
Quoted a fair price for the work, and arrived promptly.
He was able to clear the clogged main line quickly, put a camera in the line to show me what was going on, and was very patient explaining everything as he went along.
I would recommend Steve to anyone needing a plumber.

Very unprofessional and rude.
Acted like he was doing me a favor to replace a water heater.
Had enough and got someone else to do the job.
As a small business owner, I know if I treated my clients like this, I would have no clients.

My usual handyman was sick so he recommended Steve at A-Accent Plumbing to install a new sprayer head for my kitchen faucet.
I had already purchased the part so it was (I thought) a simple matter of attaching it.
The plumber arrived very promptly - the same day I called.
He was finished in 30 minutes, charged me $98 for an hour's labor & left.
I thought it was a lot but hey!
He came & fixed my problem quickly.
Fast-forward 2 weeks.
The sprayer head fell off in my hand.
My handyman came to see what was wrong and told me it wasn't installed correctly & he would speak to Steve about the issue.
Steve, however, was completely "unresponsive" (handyman's words).
No fix, no refund, no nothing.
I will NEVER use this company again & will encourage anyone who asks to go elsewhere for their plumbing needs.
This is the first negative review I have ever written.
