Great rock shop  When I was in the area on vacation I thought I should go here based on other reviews.
I am glad I did.
The rocks were reasonably priced.
They have a good selection of rocks filling up a part of the store (the rest is a gift shop).
I bought many good specimens from here.
It is close to good hiking too.

Very nice store - great for the rock hounds out there - good combination of jewelry and petrified wood, rocks, even some Local Meteorites and other gift items.
Great place to take yourself and out of town visitors.
Very Arizona and Very Carefree.
I bought a beautiful Moonstone Pendant and had lots of sizes to choose from.
Nice people and a very nice store in Carefree, AZ - Sundial Circle - Spanish Village.
