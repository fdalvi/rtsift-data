Hey i goto great clips all the time - in fact the same person just recently cut my hair for when i asked my girlfriends parents for their daughter's hand, for my engagement, for my wedding and fixed what the wife tried to do.
always very kind, relaxing experience.
and always a good haircut.

I went in yesterday with pictures that had different angles of the style I was looking for, good plan.
I get seated immediately which was nice.
I showed the girl what was looking for (essentially a layered cut framing my face).
When she was done I thought it was ok.
I knew it would look different when I got home and straightened it.
It looked different alright.
The right side of my part ( where I part) was choppy and did not fall evenly.
The left side was exactly what I was looking for.
So I went back in today to have it fixed and the girl who was there yesterday was not there now so I went with the other dark haired girl.
I told her what I wanted and it seemed like she understood.
She didn't.
Now my bangs look even worse then before and I will be needing pins to correct it.
I told her not to shorten them but to even the angle.
I now have boxy bangs and my front frame in VERY uneven.
I realize you get what you pay for when you use an affordable salon, but this is sad.

I've been a returning customer of great clips consistently for about 2 years for a reason.
When looking for a hair cut I like to be in and out and their online check in makes that possible, love walking in and skipping ahead of everyone waiting!
Also I went here to get my hair styled for my engagement pictures and Daisy did a wonderful job!
Who knew?
