I walked around looking for familiar products so I could compare prices and Pet Club's prices were higher than Petsmart and Petco on everything I compared.
I found Avoderm dog food that Petco has recently stopped selling so I went ahead and bought a bag.
I also bought an 8 oz box of Canidae Snap-Bits treats.
Unfortunately, I did not notice until I got home and mixed the treats into Peekaboo's treat container that the box is stamped "best before 4/10/13".
THAT'S TODAY!!!!
I called and the lady who answered checked the other boxes on the shelf.
They all have the same expiration date.
NOT GOOOOOOD!
Someboody has some fixing to do.

I don't know if this is a chain or a single store but its close to home and offers a different variety of doggy needs.
The people were pleasant and helpful and gave Milly lots of love.
We bought a massive elk antler for her to chew on and some probiotics for the tummy.
I also ordered a great name tag since the one we got at petco is already rubbing off.
I don't think I will shop here ALL the time because they are a bit pricier for some basic needs but for the specialty needs I will be back.

I shop at this store only because they stock a hard-to-find natural dog food and it is fairly close to my home.
The clerks are a lazy bunch who hang around the cash register yakking and rarely take the initiative to assist a customer.
In fact, the fellow who rang up my dozen items today could not even be bothered to bag them--he stood by uselessly while I did it myself.
I'm also concerned that most of the dog treats the store stocks are made in China.
With all the public attention on the lack of safety of pet food products manufactured in China, I would think that a high end pet food store would avoid such inventory.
