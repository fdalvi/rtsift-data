I like this location because I can get in and out quick everything does seem pretty fresh and the Employees are nic.

Can't believe I am just now rating this place!
Yesterday I bought like 6 packs of organic zucchini here because regular was 1.99 for a 3 pack and organic was 2.49 for the 3 pack and the regular was even on sale!
They had a great organic selection at outstanding prices.
They are a British company so many banned in Europe (horrible for you) products are left out of their selection (yipeeee) and they have the BEST organic ketsup on the planet :).
Oh and they were open on thanksgiving.
5/5+++ thanks F&E outstanding grocery.
Oh and it's 100% self check out which I don't mind.
Not for me but great dinner for 2-3 packs in every meat/veggie selection!
Possible.
Good all natural pre made lunch options as well.
Like having a personal chef or meal planner!
:).

Let me start off, by saying that I love Fresh and Easy.
I stop in virtually every day to grab myself a grapefruit fiz, and see what specials they are running.
F&E is always coming up with newer product lines and revamping their current ones (which can be positive or negative!).
The fact that F&E branded products have no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives makes them rock even more!.
