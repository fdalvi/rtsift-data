En Guarde!
My son, Kelton, really liked taking classes here.
He took the introductory course and the kids always had fun.
My only complaint is that it was expensive (200 for the 2 months) and the class is only 30 minutes once a week.
However, if your son or daughter has a pension for Alexandre Dumas novels, this is the class for them!

Coming from the Northeast where fencing is very popular and very hard to establish with a good coach, I would think local interested fencers would jump at the opportunity to fence with Shaun McGonigle.
He is young, vibrant, articulate and teaches strategic fencing, not just drills.
Cost is NOMINAL compared to other clubs (relative) which offer a fraction of the dedication.
Highly recommended for all three weapons.

Three Swords Fencing has made fencing a wonderful experience for my two teenage children.
The coaches are incredible; each coach has his or her own style of teaching, so there is a good mix of teaching styles for any student.
The atmosphere is friendly, yet professional.
The facility is clean, a well padded floor, and has equipment available for beginners (so it makes it easier to try out fencing before sinking several hundred dollars into equipment).
This academy is great whether or not the fencer is interested in competing or just fencing for fun.
I must add that the students are also polite as well as respectful to the coaches and other members of the academy.
It is a testament to both the parents and the coaches that this is a place of learning, respect, and enjoyment in the art of fencing.
