I love Gabriel.
He does an amazing job every single time I'm there.
I generally get two peekaboo highlights put in, and a cut and style, and always leaving looking great.
His attitude is always upbeat, it would be impossible to spend any time in his chair and not leave in a good mood.
The salon is always clean and comfortable.
I never feel like I'm being forced into spending more money or buying product, but when I have a question about what I should be using in my hair Gabe always makes excellent suggestions.
I have recommended him a good friend and my mother and both love him.
My mother even left her stylist of 10 years to start going to him because of the excellent service he provides.

I was in a bind yesterday and needed a cut since my regular girl was booked.
I stopped in this location because it is close to my house and got my cut done by Amanda who did a great job listening to what I wanted and it turned out great.
The cut was only $18 and my regular girl charges $30!
I stopped going to Great Clips years ago because once you finally found someone that knew how to cut your hair they would leave.
Anyway, this little place is pretty nice with a few other girls around (maybe 10-15 more stations here).
The inside is cool with color and the normal smell of a salon and the other staff is friendly.
It is a great location next to subway and my favorite Mexican joint Camineros.

I took my son here to get his hair cut.
I have had my sons hair left long since he was a baby.
He looks like a little surfer.
So getting his locks cut always makes me nervous.
Maybe it's just me.
(your saying yes aren't you?
) I have to say that this salon was very nice.
It didn't have that overpowering chemical smell that other places have and it was decorated with warm colors.
Friendly receptionists and clean.
I made the appointment with Amanda and she had everything already set up for my 8 year old.
Booster seat and all!
She was really sweet and was asking him about what he did for Thanksgiving.
She listened when he told her how he wanted his hair and would give the look asking for approval.
His hair turned out great!
He was a happy customer!
Will be back again.

I have been meaning to get my hair cut for a while but I've been apprehensive.
I used to have a great stylist in Glendale an was wanting the same pride in workmanship.
I went to a different salon on this side of town but didn't like it very much.
The shop was really nice it's just that my stylist didn't listen to what I asked for.
I decided to try Pure Elements because it was new and the reviews are really good.
I called to see if there were any openings and the had one for thirty minutes after I called.
I took an appointment with Lexi.
I hope that's how you spell her name.
But she was awesome!
A real joy to talk to and she did everything I asked with my hair.
Ben when she was finished she asked how I liked it and I had a minor change but she took care of it immediately.
I absolutely love my hair cut!!!

I would like to start by saying I'm absolutely crazy when in it comes to my hair.
As a natural brunette it is hard to find a stylist that can get it the perfect blonde without damaging it at all.
Amanda Banovac at Pure Elements does an outstanding job perfecting my color!!
I have gone to the same lady for years in Scottsdale but decided to try something a bit closer... And I am so thankful I did!
I have seen Amanda three different times now and LOVE it every single time!
Trust me I know first hand how it is having your set stylist but I promise you can't go wrong by switching to Amanda!
And prices are very reasonable which you can't beat!

Stopped by with the Aunt to get a little hair makeover before all the family photos were taken, immortalizing my split-ends.
Glad that I did!
My hair was cut by Liz and she did a lovely job.
It's clean, looked the way I described my "hair vision", and she spent plenty of time on extra touches, like making sure my ends curled under and back combing.
The stylists here are independent contractors, so they charge what they feel their services are worth.
I appreciate that - since, I feel it takes a driven and motivated person to take control of their own business image.
That's the type of person I want holding the scissors!
My aunt also loves her new cut - although I forget the name of the stylist.
Pure Elements seems to be a win.

Awesome customer service and stylist!
I will be returning!
Turned more horrible hair from a budget shop into something great!
Thank you Suzie!
Will be back!

Amy Mohr has been doing my hair for over 3 years now.
She is fabulous!
My hair is very fine and fragile so she always takes every procaution to make sure my hair is protected and comes out great.
Very resonably priced and very friendly.
Amy is always accomodating at making sure I get the apointment I want on the date I want, or the following weekend.
I have my hair foiled/bleached/highlighted every 6-8 weeks.
I was a licensed hair stylist back in my "younger days" so I am VERY picky about who I allow to touch my hair.
Amy always listens to what I want/need and is always professional.
I trust her with my hair and that is saying a LOT!
Love her!

I love this salon.
I have been going here for 5 years now.
Andrea is my stylist and is awesome.
This is my get away every 6 weeks and it's always relaxing.
The price is do affordable.

I visited Pure Elements for the first time today.
Meaghan was my stylist.
She's awesome!
Friendly!
Sweet!
Sense of humor!
Plus she have me the best cut I've had.
She listened to me and did what I asked.
My hair turned out great.
Everywhere I've been prior they've cut it way too short...Meagan nailed it!!
I found my new " Go to" place for hair, nails, brows.
They do it all here.
Thanks Meaghan!!
