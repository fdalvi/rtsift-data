always has a good selection of hookah!
my one stop shop for anything smoke related

DO NOT GO TO THIS STORE !!
If I could give them negative 5 stars I honestly would .
I came here back in December and bought a K-ECIG (150$) with a "Kanger" ProTank 2 (50$) .
I recently started having problems with the Vape and also the tank .
I went to 3 different stores that are much closer to me .
Like PINK SPOT VAPORS they told me I was ripped off and the vape is only worth 40-60$ and that the "Kanger" Pro tank that I have is a KNOCK OFF !!
DO NOT COME HERE !
Please if you're going to spend 150+ dollars on a vapor than go to Pink Spot or a place that knows what they're selling !
And if you want to get a ProTank than buy it from an AUTHORIZED KANGER dealer .
Like Pink Spot !
I am so incredibly pissed I was ripped off and I will be contacting the better buisness bureau and also Kanger letting them know I was ripped off and sold a knock off .
My mom also got a knock off Ego vapor which she also over paid for .
We're pissed !
