Where else are you going to buy Big and Tall guy stuff with style?
Come on!
Ever been to the "old guy style" B &T shops?
If it weren't for Casual Male (and the new form of it:  Destination XL, there would be nothing but epaulettes and high rise pants on my man!
Just say NO!

I came here on a whim as I was driving by because the world cannot stand to have my boyfriend wearing shirts that just aren't long enough anymore!
I walked inside and was immediately greeted and asked how I could be helped.
I let them know it was my first time in and was looking for some shirts for my boyfriend.
They were more than happy to show me around to different areas (including clearance) to help me look for something nice.
I ended buying 2 shirts, both of which my boyfriend loves!
I bought both shirts in clearance but still ended up with a $63 bill so definitely not cheap.
The salesman wasn't pushy and was really helpful.
I decided to sign up for the membership program because they told me a location would soon be opening in Chandler, which is closer to where I live.
I took my time inside and enjoyed my experience.
If you have a big/tall man in your life, definitely direct him here!

They always have something for my super picky husband.
Whether it be for a more formal occassion, or the the shorts and t-shirts he lives in.

The prices are high (even with sales and coupons) but the selection is great.
I'm used to being at the whim of whichever store I buy from when it comes to sizing.
Here?
I can get as much as I want but the prices will get you.
The staff is top notch.
Everyone is friendly and helpful.
I will say that Harbor Bay's stuff seems to shrink significantly even when we are doing cold wash and line drying.
So it may be worth getting a tall size even if you are not tall.
Other than that, I limit myself to a couple trips per year because otherwise I wouldn't have much of a paycheck left!
