Chris Phillips ... What a great attorney.
He delivered a level of personal service that is above and beyond the call of duty.
If you need any help with your family estate planning call Chris Phillips at this company.
You will be professionally served and feel great about getting your estate planning in order.
We highly recommend Chris and Black & LoBello!

Great service!
They took care of my estate planning, divorce and short sale.

WORST POSSIBLE USE OF $200  I didn't know it's generally common to get a free consultation from a lawyer.
Black & Lobello easily capitalized on my lack of knowledge and took my $200 -- in advance -- for a consultation.
I'm not one to think I can get something for nothing so I naively thought that paying $200 would get some real advice.
Not here.
The lawyer gave me literally nothing of use.
She was giving me the most vague and general answers to my questions.
After awhile I could hear her typing on her keyboard, oh checking email now are we?
On my dime?
So unprofessional.
I feel like I already know how they treat a paying customer so no need to continue with these people.
On their part they should be ashamed about taking advantage of people.
On my part, expensive lesson learned.
