My husband and I were looking to purchase a new home to move into and Randy was recommended by a friend of mine.
He listened to our needs and was easy and fun to work with.
He showed us several homes and was patient with us until we found just the right home.
He always kept us up to date on new properties and the offers that we had made so we would know where we were in the process.
We found the right home and the transaction was very smooth with Randy's help.
We are also using him as a property manager for our first home that we moved out of.
I was worried that it would take a while to find renters, but the home was rented out within a few weeks of us moving out.
I would recommend Randy for any real estate/property management needs!

We sold our home in 2012 and purchased a new home.
Randy was our agent for the sale and purchase.
It was a pleasure doing business with this young man.
He is smart and extremely well versed in the process.
He made our experience positive.
Randy is very dedicated to his business and he is definitely a people person.
I would highly recommend Randy Maher for all of your real estate needs!

Randy is the most hard-working and reliable realtor I've come across.
I've referred several friends to him and no one has ever been disappointed.
He is honest, pragmatic and realistic - you can tell that he loves what he does and he never makes you feel like you've inconvenienced him or bothered him, even if you have a million questions.
Highly recommended!

Randy helped me to short sale my condo with ease & answered all my questions on the short sale process.
He also not only helped me sell my condo but helped my fianc√© to find the home of our dreams after we had almost given up hope on homeownership.
He is knowledgable, dedicated & really cares about finding a home for all of his clients.
