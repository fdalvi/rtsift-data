Can always find what I need for my hair at a great price!!
An my Sally's card always saves me some cash !!!
Now if I can only figure out how to work all the nail stuff :)

I went to the store for the first and was greeted right away.
I was asked if I needed help and I tried to explain what I was looking forward to try to go back to my natural hair color.
The lady was not very helpful and was somewhat rude.
I tried to ask questions make sure I got the right product she just seemed as if I was a nuisance.
Then another lady asked if I needed help when I showed her the products I had and asked if it was correct she looked at me like I was retarded.
I was very frustrated because this was my first time dying my hair outside of the cheapie box and I  just looking for a little help.
There's absolutely no need for both of these ladies to be extremely rude to me when all I was doing was being a customer and asking simple questions about products they had.
The good thing I have to say about this store is it was reasonably priced and my hair did turn out nicely.

This Sallys location is my absolute favorite.
The women who work there are so beyond helpful!
I was asking them questions about dying my hair and they spent a good 20 minutes giving me helpful tricks and even showing me different techniques to highlight.
They're very honest and always point you toward the right products.
