In a nutshell, if you need to speak to a pharmcist at this location (in person of over the phone), make sure you're dealing with Matthew (who is AWESOME).
Eric is not very friendly, and short with people.

Friendly staff!

This CVS isn't a place would make on a weekly shopping stop however if i'm in an emergency and its the closest and only place open Ill go.
The staff is like a box of crayons thats been through a few kids or even classrooms.
If you know what youre going in for and then youre safe but if youre trying to find something specific that youve either never purchased before or not purchased at CVS before be prepared to spend a minute looking without assistance.

Okay store with okay location.
One time I was putting my phone into my pocket, the employee thought I was stealing.
I just told him that I was just putting my phone away.
And you are not allow to take the shopping cart and leave the store, very weird security measurement.
After all, this is somewhat a clean store.
