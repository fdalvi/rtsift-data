Pozoleria Guerrero is another little Mexican in the near-central Phoenix area.
Definitely not a bad experience and the atmosphere inside is a lot more pleasant than you would assume when driving by (think shady area).
Of course, this is the case with many of Phoenix's best Mexican spots.
The atmosphere inside was nice, the server was really friendly and helped out almost immediately.
Pozoleria Guerrero is open on Sundays which is nice as well.
The menu is fairly extensive, including the usual assortment of tacos, tortas, burritos, quesadillas, and of course pozole.
I decided to go with their specialty and got the pozole Rojo.
For those who don't know what pozole is, it's a type of pork stew that has little pieces of hominy blended in.
The spicing is excellent, and it left me with a runny nose.
A normal bowl will run you $7.25.
Other items on the menu were reasonable, with tacos ranging from a buck to $1.25.
The salsa was interesting and really spicy but good as well, although the chips were thin and left something to be desired.
All in all Pozoleria Guerrero #1 was a decent spot and I think it comes down to whether you want to get pozole.
In the future if I get a hankering I will definitely be returning.
I can't comment on the tacos, etc.
yet, but plan to try them in the future!

The different pozoles here are worth driving out of your way for.

Best pozole and menudo we ever had!
Had to order some more menudo to-go to take back home.
