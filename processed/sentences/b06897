Had them print some high quality resumes from a flash drive.
The service was fast and hassle free.

The service here is fast and friendly, and they offer lots of services.
The major downside is their pricing.
I had two copies made (~10 pages total) and got one item notarized.
This cost me over $11.
The notary fee was $.50, the copies a few cents, and then there was a $10 facility fee.
What does that mean?
Because I walked in I had to pay $10?
Is it their way of charging more for notary fees?
I'm not sure, but I was a bit disappointed.
Still, it was convenient, especially as it was 8 am and most banks or other locations that could have done notary services for me were not open yet.

Went in to get fingerprinted for a job and discovered that they can offer most of the same services that FedEx does.
They are not a true copy center but it is pretty close and I was impressed by their customer service.
For simple stuff going here will be much more convenient that driving to a FedEx store.

A nice place but a major rip off.
I was shipping some large boxes.
Here is the trick this store played and I presume major UPS Stores play.
If the LxWxH of the box is greater than 5184, then the billable weight is computed by the formula shown at this link.

Also, I had one a letter to mail and the lady charged me $3.95 to mail it.
Yes, it was less than 2oz and it was a small envelope.
That extra money I paid was just for convinece.
It's a UPS store.
These stores have no standards for prices.
They charge whatever they feel like.
