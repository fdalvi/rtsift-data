No matter which Sally store you go to, there's always that feel that the walls are closing in on you because there's so much crap everywhere and the aisles are so skinny.
This location is no different.
Regardless of which store I'm at, the employees are always happy to help me find what I'm looking for, even if they're already ringing me out.
They offer their advice about which products are best for what I need, and never try to upsell me on anything.
Thank you!

I have always liked Sally's.
I get my hair color here nice it is better on the hair then the box brands.
I also come here because they have the protein blocker I apply before I dye my hair so the color will stay longer.
They have a lot of great products but I do wish their stores were bigger.
They all seem very cramped and you will have to squeeze by other people to get down an isle.
But I guess smaller locations have less cost in rent which keeps their product cost lower so I am not going to complain to much about that.
There is always someone to help you out there.
Some times I wish they were not so young, pretty, and great looking hair and makeup LOL....
I am old and not hip so they look at me like I am so blah when I tell them I just here to hide my grays and wrinkles.

Horrible costumer service.
Didn't even want to be bothered.
Was rude and ignored me.
Also very small store and not enough employees working.
I was left holding my baby in her car seat for ever until i got help.
