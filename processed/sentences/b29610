Lars is very friendly and really knows what he is talking about.
Keys don't always seem to be a big deal, so why not just have one made at Home Depot, right?
Well, I have had keys made at Home Depot, and sometimes they work, and sometimes they don't.
When you get a key at The Locke Shoppe, it always works.
I have had a perfect track record there.
As a business owner, I can also have non-duplicatable keys made there so I know my employees won't be duplicating my keys, too.
I also like the fact that in The Locke Shoppe, I can find almost anything related to home and business security.
They do vaults, safes, security systems, keypad entry, biometrics.
Everything.
I can even get a wine bottle lock to keep the kids out!
Prices are great too!
I whole-heartedly recommend doing business with The Locke Shoppe.
Especially if honesty and integrity are important to you.

Lars is great.
Very responsive and helpful.
Really puts the client first, made suggestions to improve my security with minimal addition cost.

Timely: Lars was @ my apartment 30-40 minutes after calling him, which I appreciated as it was 6:30pm and he was probably at home already.
He opened the car without any damage to the door or window in about 3 or 4 minutes.
His price is competitive with other locksmiths.
Lars is a friendly guy and did not seem inconvenienced by my late call.
Unfortunately, I win the Darwin award for the year as the key was actually in my pocket, not in the car.

I gave The Locke Shoppe a call a second time because I had locked myself out of my apartment.
About 30-40 minutes later, Lars arrived and was able to open the door quickly, even offering to turn my door handle right-side-up, and gave me some advice as how to keep the locks in top condition.
Great service!
