Ship my sisters birthday present...Not a lot to say about this company.
They ship in a pinch and that's all I need!!!
YEA!!

I have been shipping items for the past 5 years and I have to say that this is THE worst place to ship your item.
I pack ALL of my own items and not ONE time in the past 5 years have I had an employee at a UPS, post office or FedEx store EVER tell me that the item had to be re-boxed in order for it to fit on the truck.
THEY did and I was forced to purchase a box.
Not only that, but EVERY time I walk in this place, I am asked what I am shipping.
I have NEVER been asked that till I walked into there.
So, since I knew it was the last time I was EVER going to drop a box there (i only did it because of the convenience), I was asked what I was shipping and I told them used vibrators.
PLEASE avoid this place like the plague.

Diane is the manager, she's great.
Victor is bilingual.
They're both incredibly helpful!
