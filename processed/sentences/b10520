This company took my order, and my money, then sent me tags that were engraved incorrectly, and shipped them in an envelope that was less than adequate for the order.
It arrived all ripped up, and the postage was much less than they had charged me for shipping.
When I contacted them, they were defensive and inappropriate, and didn't believe me.
They blamed the Post Office for not delivering my envelope intact, although it was crammed with merchandise and bulging way too much.
It would have been a miracle if it had arrived in tact.
And they would not refund me the overage on the postage, either.
I would never do business with this company again, and I am posting this as a warning to others who might consider doing business here.
You can do much better, and not get ripped off.

Amazing site and great products with really fast delivery.
My stainless steel tag came in 4 days and it's like a mirror finish.
well done guys at pettags.com.

Been ordering from this company before theyre was internet sales and we just love their tags and collars.
Fast delivery and the nicest customer service people online.
We will continue as long as we have pets.
