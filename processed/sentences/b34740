I have been a client of Cozy's for a few years.
I have seen her for blissful warm stone massages, orthobionomy treatments for my aches and pains, and myofascial scar release therapy.
Her skills and knowledge are way above average, she is definitely an expert in her field.
Whenever I want to be pampered or feel better, I go see her.
She is currently located in Angel Blessing Wellness Spa, which is a professional, clean and quiet office.

Cozy was great!!
She's incredibly accommodating and very pleasant.
I've been to see her now three times and will continue to do so ;)

Over the years I've had many massage experiences.
Some I liked and some, well, not so much.
What I love about working with Cozy is a couple thing:  first, Cozy herself.
She's no nonsense and professional, but she also has a spirit of fun.
Second, in the process of the massage - she doesn't create more pain along the way.
Y'know those masseuses where you're gritting your teeth through it and saying, "This is going to feel good - later.
"  I feel good through the whole thing - and I spring for the 90 minute massage, though 60 minutes is great, too.
Finally, working with Cozy she's helped me alleviate aches and pain permanently.
They do not come back.
So, she's not just rubbing on the pain - she's actually ridding my body of pain.
I just got back from vacation a few days ago and I'm so glad I have an appointment with her tomorrow.
I hurt my shoulder a bit carrying one of the heavy bags too much.
Should've gotten a cart at the airport, I know.
I feel good about the fact that after 90 minutes with Cozy that shoulder will feel a lot better and I'll have enjoyed a little mini-escapism in the middle of my day.
