Rebecca is an expert in skin care!
She is also extremely friendly & makes you feel very comfortable.
Her pricing is competitive & she has several great specials !!!
I won't let anyone else near my skin ;)

I've been seeing Rebecca for years and I have followed her to her new location!!
I traveled a lot for work and have had many facials, but what Rebecca does is an art and other facials I have had don't even compare!
Where do I start???
She is experienced and knowledgeable, has an amazing touch, the treatments not only leave my skin glowing and healthy, but the sessions are a treat of relaxation.
An added bonus, she's professional, fun, and friendly!
She takes great pride in her products and services and genuinely cares for her clients.
That can be hard to find these days!
She has great deals and I always feel that I got way more than I had to pay for.
I can't recommend her enough!
I send all my friends to her!

Rebecca's Skin Care is the best!!
Rebecca is very knowledgeable, friendly, and uses great products.
I can't imagine going anywhere else for facial treatments!

Personable and professional.
She did a great job for my step dad and I and my skin looked and felt great afterwards.
Thanks so much!
