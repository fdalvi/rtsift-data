Fun, inexpensive place for a haircut.
Real lather and straight razor neck shave.
And open Sundays.

To say that I'm picky about my haircuts is an understatement.
It's very difficult to find a good barber that can properly blend and fade the sides and the back of the head, and I've been on a nearly constant search since I moved to Henderson.
Well that search is over.
These guys are amazing.
Not only do they give the best haircut I've had here, but they do it quickly.
They possess the vanishing skill of talking and cutting at the same time to get you in and out as quickly as possible.
The shop has that old school feel of your neighborhood barber shop and social gathering place.
It's great.
Can't say enough good things.
Simply the best.

Clean fast and easy

My guy usually gets his hair cut by a woman who works here...unfortunately, she wasn't there when we went.
Because we had other things to do that afternoon, I tagged along, and waited on the chair line up that they have by the front door.
There were two men working this afternoon, one man who was heavier set with a pony tail, (I believe) and a thinner man that looked of Indian decent.
The heavier man had a client when we walked in, and was cracking jokes and making small talk with the customer.
The thin man that was open for my guy's haircut didn't say much, and decided to trim and shape up his own facial hair with a buzzer before doing my guy's haircut.....Uhhh... are you gonna sanitize that?
I like my guy's hair short.
1 all around.
The thin man made sure that we knew that was very close to the head, and almost bald.
Yes, thank you...we know.
My guy had to tell him a few times to be gentle.
The thin man was very aggressively shaving his head.
He didn't use a comb to make sure that all the hair was even, but none the less, the hair cut did come out good.
$15.
Cash only.
