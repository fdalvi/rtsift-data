I started my yoga practice 4 months ago with Yoga eight.
I went to 2 other yoga studios for their initial classes and settled with yoga eight.
I like the less crowded classes and the personal attention you get where the instructor can see you and can help fine tune your postures.

Flexible & generous scheduling (free first class!).
Nice atmosphere & good (i.e.
not distracting) music in a small, clean, bright studio.

It's a small and intimate environment.
The instructor can help each student perfect their poses and spend extra time doing so because the class sizes are so small.
Every instructor I've had there has been so warm and friendly, and they check in with you before and after class.
If you've never done yoga before, I'd highly recommend giving Yoga Eight a try.
P.S.
I tip my hat to those who do headstands and other complicated poses there--I'm too nervous about the risk of faceplanting on the laminate floor.
