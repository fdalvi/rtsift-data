Also known as HalloweenMart.com.
This location is their home warehouse, its a decent sized store for year round Halloween items.
They are open from M-F (hours unknown, prob 8-4?
), once the season draws near they expand their days/hours.
They have several locations around the valley around Halloween.
I perfer to hit the seasonal stores vs the main one because they have more visuals out.
They pretty much have everything you need for Halloween.
They have plenty of parking, the staff is friendly.
They're kinda blended in with the surrounding warehouses, so be alert (on the east side of Decatur).
Updated review: I love that this store is open year round.
Plenty of selection of just about everything!

I am a huge costume junkie and Burning Man habitue, so I speak from experience when I say this is the BEST COSTUME STORE in Vegas!
Huge, giant selection of well-organized (by theme) costumes...plus decent  shoe selection, too!
Plenty of kids costumes as well.
Lots of stage makeup and wigs, plus a whole annex of Halloween gore decos in the back.
The costumes can be expensive (as with all Halloween stores), but the shoes are surprisingly well-priced, and the wigs and hats (HUGE selection of hats) are really comparatively cheap!
And they usually have a decent-sized clearance rack where you can pick up some real bargains :-)  I whole-heartedly recommend this store!
Friendly, helpful staff, too!
**Note: it's called HALLOWEEN MART on the sign... it's right on Decatur, just south of Russell.

Really great selection, open year round!
They have some kooky stuff!
Check it out!

I have had two less-then-favorable experiences at this store.
I don't think I will be back, despite how close it is to my work (making it easier for me to go to then any other Halloween store in town).
Flash back to about a year ago.
I needed some tanga panties, the cute looking little boy shorts with all of the ruffles.
I was still debating what else I was going to wear to the event I was attending, so I started out with a black pair.
I found them near the shoes for some reason.
Didn't make sense, but their unusual placement later became important.
When I bought them I was told no refunds, exchanges only.
This also became important later.
After purchasing my other items, I realized I needed the tanga panties in pink.
So I went back to exchange them.
I wouldn't normally take panyies back a store, I'd just keep them for later use...
They had never been taken out of the sealed plastic bag though so I figured this was safe.
My receipt said exactly what I was told when I bought them - No refunds, exchanges only.
Despite this, the manager on duty the day I went back to the store refused to do the exchange.
She pointed over to a different part of the store, where a sign hung that said there was no exchanges allowed on under garments.
I pointed out that the black panties were not near that sign at all and instead in the wrong area.
I also explained that the salesperson that rang me up told me the store policy was exchanges only and never mentioned that what I was buying was not really able to be exchanged.
I ended up winning that battle.
I was still annoyed buy the entire fiasco though, so when it came time to get ready for Halloween 2009, I did all of my shopping elsewhere.
I have another event to attend this weekend that requires a costume.
I decided to swing in after work to look for a headband to wear.
When I was standing in a fairly wide aisle, an employee walked by carrying a step ladder... And she HIT me on the leg with it.
Now, I understand accidents happen, but the women didn't say a word to me.
If she realized she hit me, the lack of an apology is beyond rude.
If she didn't realize she hit me, she needs to wake up.
Either way, I am sure I can find anything I may need for Halloween or any other event at a business with better trained, more attentive employees.

This could be one of the best Halloween stores in vegas.
It is open year round, is packed to the gills with costumes, and the staff is friendly and helpful.
They are extremely busy this time of year, but the staff was willing to help answer my questions, help me find what I was looking for, and even opened the packages so I cold make sure the items would fit.
Their website is a great place to check and see if they have what you're looking for (they probably will).
Besides costumes they also have a ton of decor and other spooky items to transform your house into the Haunted Halloween Digs you've been dreaming of.

I have been here on many occasions.
Always looking for some last minute additions.
There are a surprising number of costume, wig, mustache (etc) parties I get invited to.
Halloweenmart is a great store.
They have everything you could ever need and lots of choices.
It's fantastic to just wander around and browse.
It's so much fun.
They have every genre of costume, accessory for every holiday you could imagine.
On this latest occasion, I was looking for a mustache for my fella.
Luckiily they had so many varieties to choose from and they were all very reasonably priced.
I love shopping at this place.
Lots of fun.

Halloweenmart has HUGE selection of costumes, accessories and make-up!
Their selection of decorations is superb!!
If I could afford it, I'd buy everything in their "graveyard" section of the store!!
They're open year round, which is fantastic because costumed and themed parties don't only happen in October.
They're a locally owned and operated business, which is a BIG plus in my book!
I don't live in Vegas anymore but I still have friends and family there and I'm all about supporting my hometown.
I used to shop at this store on a regular basis, when I lived in Vegas.
I think I actually bought every mustache they had in stock once.
:p Although, I no longer live there, I still order from their online store often.
Everyone I've dealt with, at Halloweenmart, has been polite and they all know their s**t!
They all seem to enjoy their job SOOO much.
Happy employees make the whole experience of shopping for costumes so much more fun!

None better; best shopping experience!
Incredible customer service.

Halloween Mart is a big store filled with what feels little selection.
They break down their inventory into themes which makes for easy browsing.
The aisles are narrow and gets jammed easily.
They do not have any dressing rooms so the sample costumes must be worn over clothes.
They most likely frown on the public nudity, so try a size and guess if you should go bigger or smaller is the name of the game.
I have been on a superhero kick lately.
They have a nice selection of higher quality outfits and accessories, but you will be paying a premium for them.
I just can't wait until November 1st because I will be taking advantage of that 40% discount.
Be sure I will not ever miss another superhero pub crawl again.
You might see me switching costumes as often as bars.

Researched places to buy a costume since Hawaii has a limited selection (and basically the same stuff every year)... and found Halloweenmart on Yelp!
THANK YOU fellow Yelpers!
Halloweenmart ROCKS!
HUUUUUGE selection of costumes, wigs, makeup, accessories, and everything in between that you'd need for Halloween.
The staff is SUPER FRIENDLY.
I can't remember the name of the gentleman that helped me... tall, skinny, Caucasian, young... he was GREAT!!!
Finally helped me to pick my costume after TWO visits to this place lol.
Great items, lots of parking, friendly staff.. the ONLY downside is that they don't have a fitting room... you have to try everything on in the aisles!
WTH!?
lol  Wish this place was in Hawaii!!!
:(   5 stars!!

EEverything and anything for costumes !

Is it Halloween yet?
I love dressing up, building scary Halloween sets and this store has it all year round!
No dressing rooms and costumes are all in bags so they arent the full on movie set costumes but if you get there early enough (the true reason Im here in August) you will be blown away by the selection.
I cant wait till Halloween and will be back many times to purchase some odds and ends before all hallows eve!

Halloween Mart has a very good selection of costumes AND props....I was really impressed with this place's set up.
I usually check back throughout the year too.
With Halloween coming, they had a back room with all the animatronics going, squared off into separate themes.
That gets this place 5 stars.
Its almost a fun little walk thru on its own!
Spirit does NOT even compare to this presentation.
What they lack is a selection of party goods- no plates, cups, napkins.
Go to Party City for that.
But they do have professional grade makeup for sale, which is kind of interesting.
No 3 color face paint wheels there!
They have GOOD quality stuff that I would actually buy when I was taking a special effects makeup course...worth checking out this season!

Bought a groupon, cuz I knew I needed a lot of halloween stuff this year!
I went in for a pink wig and left with wig, makeup, and candy,lol  They have a really good,safe,low theft system... NO dressing room, so wear minimal clothes if u wanna try on stuff.
They allow you to try wigs cuz there is no refunds on them.
You don't have to print your groupon,just let them scan it off your phone.
They prob have the best selection of all things halloween I ever seen.
Love the "graveyard" with sections of animatronic pirate skeletons, zombies, babies, clowns, etc!!!
awesome!!!
Even my 9-yr old loved that area!
Above all,go now, while there is not a line out the door and there is still decent selection.
PS: check out my profile pic-that's my new wig!!
JEM!

I am amazed by how great their customer service is.
I ordered decor items online using a Groupon, but when they arrived, they had sent the wrong item (due to the similarity in the name of the item).
The incorrect item arrived on a Wednesday, and I needed it for my Halloween party on Saturday.
I called to see what they could do.
Not only did Halloween Mart send the correct item, they shipped it overnight, all free of charge, so that I'd have it in time for my party.
And they did not require me to send back the incorrect item.
That kind of customer service is increasingly rare, and I'll definitely order from Halloween Mart again because of it.

Halloween Mart was a life saver for me on Halloween this year.
I procrastinated on a costume and was left trying to find something quick.
It was about 8 PM and almost everything was closed.
I yelped around and found this place.
I only had an hour and made my way here.
As soon as I arrived, the first thing I noticed was that I wasn't the only master procrastinator.
This parking lot was packed and this gave me flashbacks of my retail years working at Party City.
Before I walked in, I expected an unorganized and crowded mess.
I was wrong, just the opposite.
Halloween Mart knows Halloween!!
This place was well ran and I take it that they prepare for this.
One entrance and one exit to prevent the shoplifters from doing their thang.
Went in and was greeted by almost every employee.
I must have looked lost, because multiple different employees offered assistance.
I eventually found a quick custom and headed towards the line.
Line was long, but went quick.
I'm also told that this place is open all year round.
Selection and prices are bar none.
Kudos Halloween Mart for being organized, staffed properly, and being open during my time of need.
Next year, I will come early.
And yes, no dressing rooms here.

They offered a groupon and then were out of stock of everything!
Place two more orders trying to redeem my groupon over the next couple of months and every time they responded back saying they were out of stock of those items as well.
Finally I picked a another set of items and then they said it was back ordered and I'd have to wait till june to get them so i said okay thats fine.
Then they call me back two weeks later and say now those items are out of stock.
8 months later and I am still trying to use my groupon.
What a joke of a place.
I would never spend another dime at this place!

Halloween Mart is the #1 dress up headquarters in Las Vegas AND on the web.
www.halloweenmart.com The retail store is open all year long.
Whatever the occasion may be, the staff has an awesome imagination to bring your vision to reality.
Personalized customer service from a knowledgeable staff is something I enjoy wherever I shop.
You'll find everything from spooky props, decorations, holiday costumes, accessories, dance and rave gear, theatrical makeup, masks, wigs, shoes, lingerie, and so much more.
I have created so many costumes and looks from this store for the past few years alone.
I would highly recommend Halloween Mart to all my friends and family out there.

Very good traditional costume selection, with some added rave-wear that was interesting -  including a light-up headress.

Open even when it ISN'T Halloween for all your costume needs!
SCORE.
EDC weekend is fast approaching and although I'm not a raver, I better look like one damnit!!
I walked in and found everything I needed right away.
Friendly staff and I was good to go!
LOOOVE IT!!!!!!!!

This place rocks way better than any place ive been in town...I finally found my Halloween outfit for a lower price than e-bay or amazon!
THANKS  to Tavia and her great above and beyond service im going to look great and cant wait to send all my friends here to find their halloween must haves!!!
Or just cool costumes for whatever the occasion!

If looking for anything Halloween related Halloween Mart is the spot.
It open year round so if not every October or looking for costume for theme party fairly good chance find it.
I came in search too fill out some accessories that I lost from few years back outfit.
I walking around looking at current outfits or see maybe the trendy outfit this year.
Little frustrating cause they have lot of stuff looking for little accessories.
Needle in the haystack.
Thankfully being October they are full on staff and constantly people walking around asking if you need help.
I got lead in the right direction and happy that had couple of options rather then just one.
Sure Halloween Mart help frill out my Halloween outfit.
The staff there is friendly, helpful, and no doubt can tell they have the Halloween spirit.
The only thing steer clear from is as it gets closer too Halloween it zoo and more then likely more popular items will be out of stock.
Happy Halloween!

So I came into your store today with my little girl looking for something she could wear.
I had a hard time with finding an outfit she liked cause she didn't want to be anything girl related this year.
But you guys had a great girl named Jessica working in the aisle we were in who helped us find a cool Batman costume that my little girl loved and was so happy with.
Not the normal thing for a girl to wear but she was very happy and I was relieved to have had such a helpful employee walking us through til we found what we wanted.
It's nice going to a place with professional and patient people who can make shopping that much easier.
Thank you....

It's bigger and better organized than the stores that pop up only during the season, but it's not overly impressive.
The wig selection is really good, and I wouldn't go anywhere else for those.
In general the costumes are a bit expensive.
But that's not really the fault of the store as the MSRP is high these days.
You won't find much under $40.
Most are in the $50-$70 range.
The staff is helpful and friendly.
I like the system here where the costumes out on the floor are floor models to try on and an unopened bag is presented on checkout.
It's annoying at other stores when a lot of costume bags are missing parts, and you won't have that problem here.

After running around to a few different stores in search of a Halloween costume I finally stumbled upon Halloween Mart.
This store is full of great costumes and props and the best part is that it is open year round.
They have a ridiculous selection and a lot of staff to help you with whatever you need.
They don't have dressing rooms and make you try on the outfits in the aisle but other than that the store is awesome.
If you can't seem to find a costume go there and be amazed especially last minute.
Overall I will definitely be coming back here whenever I need to dress up in the future.

Good selection every year of costumes although like every other costume shop the prices are crazy for the cheap materials most costumes are made from.
They do have a great selection of wigs and other props.
Didn't spend too much time looking at decorations for the yard, but it looked like they had a good amount of stuff for that as well.
This place is open year around which is great if you have a dress up party anytime other than on Halloween.

wide variety of costumes and accessories.
but the store isn't as big as some of the others in town.
and it is a tad bit more expensive than other places around here, but its not a total rip off by any means.
if you don't feel like driving to town square or some other costume shop, halloween mart will suit you just fine.
just expect to pay a couple of bucks more here than somewhere else.

If you're looking for a costume of any type, this is really the only place to visit in Las Vegas .
The selection is large and the prices are fair also.

Good selection of costumes for all ages.
As long as you go a week before halloween there are hardly any lines & plenty of sizes.
Prices are average for any costume store.
A good go to for about any costume you can think of.
