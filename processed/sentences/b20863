What a beautiful little jewellery boutique Ocean Jewellery is, it's gorgeous!
Everything in store is specially selected by the owners and as such they have a beautiful, unusual range of pieces that you won't find anywhere else in Edinburgh.
The thing that strikes you as soon as you walk into this store is the variety and all the different colours of different stones etc.
there's something for every taste.
Ocean Jewellery is ideal for gifts and many of the items are very affordable, around the £20 - £30 mark.
When I popped in recently I saw a gorgeous pair of woven silver style heart earrings and I've been thinking about them ever since.
Gutted that my birthday isn't anytime soon.
The staff are very friendly and when browsing I never felt any pressure to buy which makes a change as some jewellery shops are terrible for that.

This rating is only for the nail studio part of this shop.
I love it and go there every 2 weeks to get my shellac nails re-done.
I definitely recommend this as a great little place for manicures and pedicures.
They do shellac (wide selection of colours!
), gels, minx and fancy nail design if that floats your boat.
I'm a plain old shellac girl myself but I'm fussy with how I like them shaped.
I'm never disappointed, hence my return custom!
They always have availability even when I call at short notice.
The shellac manicure costs around £25 (and they don't charge more for soak off which irritates me in other places!
) but I think you can get it a bit cheaper with their newest therapist who is still building up her clientele list.
If you're thinking about trying, i recommend Louise who does my nails.
She's quick,  friendly and a perfectionist when it comes to applying colour.
Great!
