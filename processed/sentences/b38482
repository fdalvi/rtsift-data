Place is a JOKE!
Walked in their to get a hair cut and sat down and the stylist decides to have a 5 min conversation with a salesperson that walked in after me.
I would have thought she would cut my hair as she talked but didnt.
I got up and left.
She had a stupid look on her face.
Never going back there again.

Been to this location for our kids' haircuts many times.
They do a good job....and make the kids feel at ease.
Clean place - as much as any place with loads of hair can be.
They offer online check-in too which saves alot of time when you walk in with 3 heads for haircuts.

Terrible hair cut, the person cutting my hair (attempting) had to call someone over twice to fix her mistakes, I didn't think a "one" on the sides and a fohawk fad was too much to ask for, well ended up going home and shaving my head.... Stay away from this place

Employees sitting outside after haircuts,  laughing at baby birds dying.
Actually swatted them away with magazines.
Emotionally scarring for my kids to see this.
The birds were beyond saving unfortunately or my husband would have rescued them as he's done in the past.
Going back to the kids places for them in the future to spare them seeing this type of 'human being'.
