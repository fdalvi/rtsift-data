Customer service was excellent.
The woman who took my order was in a fantastic mood and seemed like she was having a great day, a very pleasant, simple thing that brightened my day up after having difficulties at work.
Food was standard Taco Bell, delicious and streamlined to taste the same everywhere, but the customer service was impeccable and due to this I will definitely return.

This is the best taco bell I have ever been to.
I go maybe one to two times a month.
They are super fast, very friendly and I always order weird things (switch out items for others) and I have never once had an order wrong.
Even though I am special ordering, they are still insanely fast.
I love this place.
They will also suggest if you can save money by switching to a combo, etc.

My experience was very different from the other reviews.
After giving the cashier my order, I sat by a window.
I calmly watched person after person park their cars, walk into the store and give their orders and receive them right away.
I simply ordered nachos.
After several minutes of this, I decided to ask for a refund.
The manager apologized and said he will have someone make it right now.
I asked" was anyone trying to fill my order before I came up?
" Apparently not!!!
So I wasted my entire lunch hour waiting for a dish that was never going to come.
I refused the offer to "make it now" as I didn't have any time left.
I had to leave hungry and pissed.
