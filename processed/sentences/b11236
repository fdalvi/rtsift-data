I love these people so, so much.
For over a year now I have taken my dry cleaning, stray buttons, and anything in my closet that needed a little touch-up to them and it has always come out wonderfully.
But the best part about this place is that they do student discounts.
As a self-proclaimed fashionista who owns literally over 500 items of clothing, I have given this place a lot of business and having the student discount keeps me coming back.
The owners are very sweet and get things done very efficiently and correctly.
It is very much like a mom and pop shop, which is a rarity especially in this city.
From little things like adding a snap closure on a shirt to complete makeover alterations, this business does it all at a very fair price.
I am sure as long as I live in Vegas I will keep coming back to them.
My closet and my wallet thanks them greatly.

I seem to have shorter arms than the average guy.
Whenever I get a new coat, the sleeves always end up being too long.
It makes me look like a 5 year old trying on daddy clothes.
Because of this, alterations are something that aren't unusual for me to get.
Over at Come & See Alterations, I've had a few hems done along with sleeve jobs on blazers.
Prices were reasonable and can vary upon garment type.There's also an extra 10% off for being a student.
They've always done a good job and got things done promptly.
This one time I took in my blazer, the woman could tell that I needed it done quickly.
Instead of having the 2-3 waiting window, she said she'll have it done for me the next day.
It's special service like this that'll keep me coming back.

The work they do is great, their prices are affordable.
But this place is never open when they say they are.

Good work and kind staff.
Great for UNLV students who live on campus and need a close place to take their suit at an affordable price.
