I was referred to Dr. Docasar from a friend to help me with my menopause symptoms.
She uses the bio identical hormones, and let me tell you, it's been amazing!
I'm a different person!
No more hot flashes, night sweats, or cray cray episodes.
I highly recommend her for all your female needs.
She's very kind, patient and genuine about my well being.

I saw Dr. Docasar on and off for over 4 years now (because I'm always out of town).
She is such a great woman!
Last time I had to get a procedure done at her office, her team was so funny and easygoing which took my mind off of the stress of the procedure.
When I came back for a follow up visit 2 weeks later, my insurance had ran out.
I was really worried about paying for the appointment (I'm a student with no job), and she told me don't worry about it and that she'd rather see me put the money into taking care of myself.
I was so touched!
That had to have been my best encounter with a doctor!

I was very eager to visit Dr Docasar as I'd heard wonderful things about her from friends of mine.
Being new to the area, it was a relief to find  a new OBGYN to see for my female related appointments.
However, my first office visit was a very bad experience!
I not only heard the doctor yelling at one of her employees but using profanity too It was not only horribly unprofessional, but very frightening as well.
I didn't even stay for my visit because I was so upset.
I believe that a doctor's treatment of her employees is a huge reflection on her as medical professional.
What kind of bed side manor could she possibly offer to her patients with an ugly temper and foul mouth?
I'd suggest that women run very quickly from her office!
