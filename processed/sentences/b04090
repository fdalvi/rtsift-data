Nice people, and reasonable prices.
Plus, the biggest shirt you've ever seen.
If I'm lying, I'm dying

My class is doing a retirement gift for a professor of ours and after searching google for an embroidery shop who would do just 1 item I found Big Stitch.
I went in today after emailing for a estimate and going back and forth with Roy via email as he answered all of my questions.
I was very happy with the quick ordering and I was so worried I would not be able to get it in time but when Roy told me that he would have it done in a week I was thrilled.
Still have to wait for the final product and I will give it a 5 stars.
Will use this shop again in the future.

I placed a order for my club baseball team and had 44 hats embroidered, when I went to pick the hats up four days later then said, 14 of the hat logo's were not centered on the hat.
Well he just purchased a new machine last week that does six hats at a time and he's telling me that having the logo offset 1/4" to the side is "pretty good to him"  maybe you should take some time and learn how to use your new machine..... he's now telling me and my eight year old team that were out of luck.
DO NOT TRUST Roy Davis his work is poor and he's ok with it that way.
