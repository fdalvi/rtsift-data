This Circle K is very convenient on & off the 101 near Desert Ridge and the gasoline prices are great (worth the trip)!

I went in for gas and the CC  machine wasn't working properly.
I had some gas in the car, but decided to fill it.
Their gas prices are reasonable.
I paid the clerk $20 with the same CC.
Apparently, I only needed $17 worth.
The clerk (caucasian man in his low-50's) refused to give me my 3 bucks back.
He was a total ass!

This is one of the dirtiest gas stations I have ever encountered.
A little power-washing would go a long way.
Or, if that is too difficult, perhaps try simply emptying the overflowing trash cans periodically?
At any given time, a minimum of 3 of the 12 pumps are out of order.
The ones that do work are covered with scratched-in graffiti markings.
Classy.
The only redeeming quality is that the gas is usually a few cents cheaper than nearby competitors.
The only reason I keep coming back.
I guess you really do get what you pay for...
