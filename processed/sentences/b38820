Stopped in the store @ the Bellagio to look for a wallet.
The salesman was very helpful and I was able to select one pretty easily.
Love this store!

Worst saleswoman ever.
My husband and I were going for a stroll after a fantastic dinner.
When we go on vacation (rare occurrence), we like to buy something that is his and hers.
My birthday is also coming up and we wanted to take a look at the belt colors and buckles.
She hesitantly asked us if there was something we were interested in.
As soon as I uttered belt, she looked me up and down and said that none of her belts will fit me.
How rude!!
I'm a size 6 in pants.
We were dressed fairly modestly so how would she know that we were both physicians who could afford an extravagant belt, or 2.
I will never purchase anything in this store and I suggest the same to you.
If I could give this store's location a negative star, I would.

Richard is the best sales associate among all others at any Hermes Boutique I have ever been to!
He is gentle, polite, smart and very professional.
After a short conversation, I knew he had been living in Japan for years in the past, my fianc√© could still recognized Richard's japanese accent.
Nevertheless, he used to work at Hermes boutique in Waikiki, Hawaii.
Thus, I assume that given his "international experiences" and the length of his career life, Richard really knows how to properly treat a customer!
Anyway, we have had a very pleasant shopping experience at the Hermes boutique at Bellagio!
Absolutely gonna come back and shop more there one we have time!

I began my Hermes adventure with the wonderful Ms. Sarah at this dainty little boutique tucked away in the lobby of Bellagio.
Sarah is such a sweet SA, and even though I sometimes shop at my local H boutique, she's always provided top notch service and of course.... gorgeous bags.
Ask for Sarah, she will take care of you.
