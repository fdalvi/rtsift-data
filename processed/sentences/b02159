I am a frequent Subway patron, but I will not patron this franchise again.
I am also a supporter of our local High School sports teams.
When I presented a discount card from Boulder Creek HS, the manager REFUSED to honor the card.
Please do not support this Subway franchise as they do not support our schools and sports teams.

I got the tuna on honey oat with veggies.
Everything was fresh, and the tuna salad had the right amount of mayo, imo.
Not too much like at some locations!
I have ordered this particular sandwich many times, and this was a perfect example of why.
It's not amazing, but it's pretty good, especially for a quick, inexpensive, and healthier lunch.
The store was clean, the employees were friendly, and this is a convenient location for me.
I also liked that there is a designated handicap table.
I actually go to a lot of Subways, and I must say this was rare to find.
I would come back.

This subway is very Clean and the Staff is Great.
Love that they give the local high school students job opportunites!
Great food
