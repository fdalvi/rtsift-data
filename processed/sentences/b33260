Was referred here by a friend and very happy!
Great job on my cleaning and fabulous with my 6 yr old little girl, we'll be back!
Thanks

Had some re-work that needed to be done and could'nt have been happier with the way things turned out, the prcie to.

This office was awesome!
I was referred to them through an agency that I work with.
I called on a Monday and they got me in on Wednesday.
I got there and was greeted by the young lady at the desk with a smile!
I filled out all my paperwork and they took me back right away.
They stayed right on time.
So after having my x-rays and exam, I needed to have a tooth pulled.
Instead of rescheduling me to a different day, they did it while I was there.
So no second trip back!
The procedure didn't take long at all and it was painless.
The doctor was great and so were his assistants!
I have always disliked the dentist but was very happy with the way I was treated here!
They are great and I can't thank them enough for doing such a great job.
I will be returning for a cleaning soon and am looking forward to seeing their happy faces!

If you can tolerate the very rude unproffessionl receptionist, its not a bad place.

I have been going to Southwest smiles for over a year now and they have been great!
In the past few months I have had increased dental work done including a new bottom partial to cover 3 teeth and veneers on my top teeth.
I couldn't be happier!
I now have a perfect smile.
There is always a pleasant atmosphere here, the wait is never long, and they are great at  talking through all options and answering any questions.
