On my way to the airport I wanted something fast that wasn't McDonald's, Wendy's, Taco Bell, Del Taco, Carl's Jr or Jack In The Box.
OH LOOK!
KFC across the street.
I always said I wanted to try it.
Mostly because I haven't had KFC in a long, long time.
I think the KFC I ate in India didn't count, because it was in another country...anyway, I digress.
Whatever you do, don't go.
Please, don't go.
I took a verrrry big hit for the Mesa/PHX yelpers in going here.
I'm surprised I didn't get food poisoning.
The place is disgustingly filthy.
The tables were sticky and from a distance they all looked clean until you sat down.
I wanted to cry.
I really did.
It's such a huge contrast to the other fast food restaurant I went to.
Booths were unstable as was the clientele.
I felt really overdressed in my grubby jeans and grubby shirt.
The cashier and the servers were friendly and nice...I think they realized I was the only customer that wasn't high on something.
I was truly disturbed by some of their patrons - they were walking adverts for "DON'T DO DRUGS".
I think this KFC/A&W really killed any and all future KFC cravings.
I said that this place wasn't good for kids - mostly because I'm worried they'll catch next year's strain of the flu - yup, if you want to get your immune system up, come here.
Ok, going to go shower now that I remember what this place was like.
*shudders*

I was greeted by a friendly cashier as I entered and my order was taken immediately.
The price was outrageous but I paid it cuz me and the kids were hungry.
The order was ready quickly and we were served with a pleasant attitude.
The Restaurant was clean And everything was well stocked.
