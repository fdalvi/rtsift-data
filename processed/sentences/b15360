Great staff!
They have always helped me whenever I have trouble with something and they give their best efforts every time.
Clean layout and store, and caring, friendly staff.

This walmart never seems to have anything.
When I go to other walmarts I am surprised by all the things they offer.
It is very clean and friendly staff.

I like this one... not too hectic for a Superstore, and, well, it's super...

Its Walmart.
As far as Walmarts go it is very clean inside and out.
That is a plus compared to most locations I've been too.
I'd still much prefer we had something else in our community, but it is what it is.
If they ever start treating their employees better then I would consider giving them more stars, but they continue to pay their employees low wages and offer them little to no benefits.

The photo department was super helpful and went out of their way to help save me some money I my prints.
