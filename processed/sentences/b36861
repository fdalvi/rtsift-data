Best prices on cigarettes, don't really do anything else but come here and buy my tobacco.

What kind of a place is this supposed to be?
A hangout for dumbbells?
There's nothing in this place.
Is this a joke?
There are slot machines in the middle of the floor and a counter of some kind off on one wall.
They sell....
cigarettes?.....
pies?....
Can I get a pie, please?
Do they sell small bags of chips?
Chewing gum?
Bic lighters?
How about a free toothpick?
Can I have a book of matches?
So much empty floor space.
As I recall, there were only about 6 slot machines in the whole joint?
Oooooh, funnnnn!!
C'mon, Dotty, jazz up your dump.
Gimmee a burger and fries.
Gimmee a hot dog with extra mustard.
Gimmee!
This company seems to do well since Dotty has a chain of these slot machine garages all over Vegas.
Not much here for me.
I can have more fun stomping on ketchup packets.
