Eating at Tutto Pasta reminds me of one of the commercial bits which used to run for Ebert and Roeper at the Movies:    "This movie just sucks!
" - Roeper.
"How could your heart be so cold?
" - Ebert  This exchange really describes Tutto.
It's bad, consistently bad.
For a seemingly moderate Italian restaurant the food is shockingly disappointing.
But you wanna try it because it looks good, you wanna like it, you wanna give it the benefit of the doubt...you wanna go back in time.
The food is simply blah from start to finish.
Manicotti in cream sauce was overpowering in cream and lacking a real savory ricotta center.
A pasta and shellfish dish contained bland seafood and a similarly less than enjoyable sauce.
Even the bread, which from an Italian place you expect to be at the very least enjoyable was poorly seasoned and mushy; a sign of things to come.
Is the food inedible?
No.
Is it ridiculous for a restaurant of its price range to be serving that?
Yes.
Having eaten at the State Street location before, the food there wasn't good but admittedly better.
But the Middleton location falls totally amiss, often it seems as locale eateries stem out across their areas their branches seem to dip (pardon the tree analogy).
But in a country where Italian restaurants are just as abundant as American ones there's really no need settle for anything less than consistency of the good variety.

I'm not sure about the experience that the other Yelper had, but we were just here for our New Year's dinner, and had a great time.
The Middleton Tutto location has a nice warm atmosphere, a bit more upscale than it's State St. sister.
I also appreciated not getting seated near the waitstaff prep area(as we did upstairs on State, which was pretty noisy).
It also seemed like there were more menu options here, as well.
In fact, my boyfriend and I had a hard time deciding!
We finally agreed on the homemade cannelloni(which was very good, although I would have liked the sauce with more tomato, less cream...it was just so RICH), and the Rigatoni with Sausage and Mushrooms(which was also nice,  hearty but not overpowering).
The waitress was a bit, off(spilling our sugar packets all over, and refilling my coffee with decaf, and then asking my man if he wanted her to go grab the regular for him--I told her that *I* was drinking regular and he had decaf) but nothing terrible.
We will definitely go here again, because there were a few items we need to try next time!

I really like this place.
Tutto Pasta might not be the ultimate authentic Italian experience, but for this uncultured suburbanite, it does its job just fine.
The food is consistently good.
Comparisons could be made to Olive Garden, and certainly fans of that chain would like this place.
But the food is much better quality at Tutto Pasta, and also a bit more adventurous.
However, don't expect five-star dining.
This is Italian done for the simplistic tastes of the majority of the dining public, so don't expect absolutely stunning food.
I usually get one of the pasta dishes, and I'm always happy no matter which one I pick.
The pizza, while made in a wood-fired oven, is unfortunately too salty for my tastes.
The decor is excellent.
Very cozy and rustic, although it can seem a little overdone.
The "caves" with booths in them are especially nice.
Since we usually go here on Saturday lunch, the caves are always available.
Whenever I've been here there's never been more than five other parties dining; hopefully they get more patrons for dinner, because I don't think they can sustain themselves with so few diners.
The friendliness of the service could be improved, but since the restaurant is never very crowded, we've always gotten our food quickly.
The prices are reasonable at lunch but tending towards unreasonable on the dinner menu.
I've never been disappointed with a meal at Tutto Pasta (although companions have complained about oversalted pizza).
There's certainly more authentic Italian in the Madison area, but for unpretentious Americanized Italian food, Tutto Pasta is about as good as it gets.
I highly recommend.

I've given this place a try three separate times now.
Aside from the "Tutto Pasta" dish, which is pretty good, nothing else seems to be done all that well.
Most other dishes fairly bland.
Consistently poor service.
Horrible cheesecake (mealy and partially frozen)!
Too bad it's just not very good because they do have outdoor dining, which is something that most Middleton and Madison restaurants seem to lack.

It's your typical Italian restaurant ...
The food was good I ordered pizza, a glass of wine and some lemon dessert...
They were all well in taste... what made it 4 stars was the service .... the waiter was AMAZING ... he made sure our food was what we wanted, was on top of getting my wine, he was also good about making sure our water glasses were refilled and etc..

Ate here two nights in a row, staying in hotel nearby.
We ate in the bar.
The bartender, a very friendly lady from Argentina, provided AWESOME service.
She was the main reason we came back a second time.
The food was good.
Bread was really good.
I had pizza and my associate had minestrone.
Both were very good.
Still kind of wondering why people live in Wisconsin when there's 49 other states to choose from, but that has nothing to do with Tutto Pasta.
I would eat here again.
If you're looking for the best Italian of your life, you may be disappointed.
If you want decent prices, great service, and good food, stop in.

We stopped in here after a workday on a business trip.
The decor and the menu are rather like every other neighborhood Italian place.
The service was mediocre; nothing exceptional.
Thankfully the food was enjoyable.
I had the spaghetti dish with the seafood variety.
In summary, I don't think this is a place to go out of your way for, but if I was placed at the same hotel again, I would likely return for another meal.

The food is delicious...the service during our last visit was HORRIBLE.
Incredibly rushed, water and coffee never refilled, (we actually went to the kitchen to get the coffee refill) and worst of all the waiter was so unbelievably rude that we'll never go back.

Absolutely awful service... OK food... Had to wait an hour after our reservation to finally be seated then had to ask for bread and to place an order... After all that they did not offer to comp anything... Will not be back

The food (I had the tutto pasta) was very good.
The dessert (mixed berry tart) was ok.  Would've given 4 stars had I not had to wait 10 minutes at each opportunity (for water, for initial order, and probably 15 minutes just to get my check).

Went for lunch.
When we walked in I was impressed with the ambiance, but the meal failed to live up to the expectations.
Service was slow and waitress messed up my wife's order.
She did try to fix it but by the time you do that the other person's food is always cold.
She ended up just getting a bowl of soup that tasted like it had been sitting for some time..
I had the veal, it was tasty, very cheesy and the bruschettawas good.
Wasn't what I would call authentic but it wasn't terrible either.

When I saw Tutto Pasta's menu -- a long list of unusual pasta dishes, including some homemade pasta, with quality ingredients and rarer pasta types, cheeses, and sauces -- I was elated and couldn't wait to try it.
Unfortunately, my pasta (a spicy daily special with anchovies) was a bit of a greasy salt-fest.
I know anchovies are inherently salty, but it didn't seem like the chef made the dish otherwise less salty to compensate.
My friend ordered a daily special chicken entree and also felt it was just OK.
The restaurant was gorgeous inside -- and completely empty for a Saturday lunch!!
I went with a Groupon specifically for this location, so it appears they are trying to drum up business.
I heard it was newer but other reviews seem to indicate it's been open for four years.
They did have a good wine list.
If Tutto Pasta could focus on making the food a bit fresher and lighter, I'd gladly come back -- and probably will, just to give them one more try, since they have plenty to choose from besides plain old bolognese.

Service ok, Food ok. Nice atmosphere.

Living close by, I was really hoping this place would turn out great.
I excellent was let down by the small portions and the fishiest fish I have had in a while.
Entrees came out cold and over cooked.
The highlight was the waiter, he was excellent and was apologetic.
Too bad they haven't figured out the food yet.
They need to spend the money and get a good chef.

The staff and food were wonderful for my daughter's group of 6 before their Junior Prom.
Splitting the checks was handled professionally, they were respectful to these hardworking teens, and the food was wonderful.

Don't come here on UW graduation weekend unless you're part of a big party.
They're too understaffed to pay attention to the little tables.
They were out of the first thing I ordered (Veal Manicotti), so I ended up with Veal Parmesan.
Overall, the food was pretty standard for an Italian restaurant.
They have a children s menu, and my 8 yr old was happy with the Fettuccine Alfredo.
It did strike me a bit odd that they had a children's menu, but didn't have apple juice.
With better service, I would have probably rated 3 stars.
