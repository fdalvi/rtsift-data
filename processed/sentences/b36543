Republic Services, Las Vegas's trash monopoly can be clueless if you call in to try and find things like where to pick up recycle bins or order a trash can.
The call center reps will send you to transfer stations with offices that are closed on weekends and annoy you to no end.
But that all changes when you visit the Henderson Transfer Station office.
There was a lady there that had my recycle bins, she was able to answer ALL of my questions, and she did so with a smile.
The quality of service provided...it was amazing compared to the phone experience.
4 Strong Stars.
Yes a smiling older lady handing me recycle bins made me almost forget about the clueless call center people.
And if you have to go in to dump trash here, the line looks long but the staff tries to move it along quickly.

It's like pulling teeth to get recycling bins out here.
We tried to have them delivered...twice.
Then we went to the office on Sahara: out of them.
Finally, we got them here.
The girl was polite and sweet and I was happy that it was over so they get points for that.
But seriously just go get the damn things instead of having them delivered.
It's a lot less hassle and it's cheaper.

Why have 1 day a week service and then on Saturdays.
I guess I have to decide between ever going out of town versus getting trash picked up.
Terrible idea.
