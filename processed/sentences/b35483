I am a long time client of, Karri Hayes.
Due to her knowledge and expertise in skin care I have been able to not only quit taking antibiotics for my adult acne but I have the complexion I never thought I'd have.
Thank you, Karri for not only treating my problem skin but teaching me to take care between my visits.
You have also helped my kiddos keep their complexions crystal clear!
Such a positive influence my daughter is going to school to be an Aesthetician!
Thanx Karri!
See you...

My doctor recommended me to Karri after I asked her about her glowing skin.
That was about six years ago and I have been happily getting treatments ever since.
Karri is professional, conscientious and very straightforward and up-to-date about skincare.
I rarely have a skin issue now, and when I do, it's amazing how she can get in there and take care of it.
I seriously wish I had known her years earlier.
As others mention, she is also fun and energetic, and I get great advice from her about products and other treatments.
I wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone seeking serious, clinical skincare.

Karri, was an amazing person with a wonderful heart.
She took her time explained the laser hair removal process and what needs to be done.
She is not only detailed but, very careful with sensitive skin.
Karri is wonderful with her profession and affordable.
You defiantly get wonderful results as well the confidence you need once the procedure is done.
I live in LA and went to Arizona for a few weeks and I know once I buy my flight ticket my appointment with her will be the next thing i do!
Again, I highly recommend you check out all her services and you will not be disappointed!
PS..make sure you go in with lots of energy this woman will knock you off your feet!
Lots of laughs and lots of fun!
