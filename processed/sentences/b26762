Great little cigar shop with a good selection, works for me.

great place... awesome selections.. smoke some Romo & Julietz.
cigars great after dinner.. an wine..

My favorite cigar shop in town.
Paul, the owner, is a helpful friendly guy who will discuss cigars and most anything else.
The customers who frequent the place are also friendly and conversational.
There are more opulent places you can go to, but none more friendly.
Prices are moderate and there is a large selection in the upright cabinet-style humidors.

Great smoke's and good friends.
Paul has the best selection of the CIGARS!

YES a woman is going to review a cigar shop.
I might not smoke them, but my husband loves them and I love him, so I have learned a lot about cigars.
I can tell you as a woman I have NEVER felt uncomfortable walking into this cigar shop no matter how many men are in there smoking and hanging out.
Paul the owner/manager is a true gentleman and the men who gravitate towards him are the same.
I don't think he would tolerate bad behavior.
Now the important part.
His cigar collection is REALLY good and if you don't know what you want Paul will ask you a couple questions and BOOM there's your perfect cigar.
He is the cigar whisperer.
It comes in really handy when I want to surprise my hubby with some really nice cigars, I know I can count on Paul to help me out.
He has never failed us.
For those of you that live out of state like we do, call him up, give him your credit card and he has them mailed to you.
YES it's worth it, his prices and quality are unmatched.
If there is something special you are looking for he can place an order for you.
Ladies if you want a special gift for your man, there are many cigar associated accessories here for you to choose from.
He has a rewards program, so don't forget to sign up for the Hemingway rewards card.
