Honest and Trustworthy!!!
Bought a Kirby from Kirby of Avondale a couple years ago,  never happy with it,  Brought it in for service here.
turns out I was sold a dud, pieced together parts from new and older models!!!!
Owner was honest with me and went to bat to make it right!!!
Got me a brand new Kirby!!!
Earned my business for life...Highly recommended!!

Be aware that if you are an original owner of a Kirby, you can send your machine to the factory for a complete Kirby rebuild for about 1/2 the price.
You do have to pay for shipping your heavy machine and it takes several more weeks, but I wasn't given this option at the time my "repair" turned into a full rebuild.
As a Kirby authorized service center, I would assume that it would be required to provide all options.
I was specific in asking about the "lifetime" warranty I was sold on and it was kind of blown off saying that it wasn't lifetime, there was only a 3 year factory warranty.
I felt sick that I over paid by more than $200 and it says "all sales final" everywhere.
I should have done more preliminary research and to be fair, they were very thorough in explaining the differences in the rebuilds after the fact when I called them about it.
They gave me the pros and cons and extended my warranty for another year through them to try to make it right.
(They got 1 extra star for that.
) I just wish it had been mentioned before I forked over the $$$.
I probably still would have done it through them, but I would have at least liked knowing all my options.
My rebuilt machine looks good and works well.
I hope my "new" machine lasts me another 12 years.
That way the price I paid will be worth it.

Dave (owner) was up front and honest.
He did everything he could to help me out to get the vacuum that I wanted and needed.
He spent the time to go over the warranty and made sure I understood how to operate the machine.
I love my new Kirby vacuum and I recommend them.
The only downfall was that they don't take AMEX.
I like my AMEX card for big purchases like this plus my reward points, but they do take other credit cards.

Great service, and wonderful work by Dave and Karl.
Couldn't be happier with the work performed.
Fast service and quality work.
Great work Dave and Karl.
Love my G5.
5 stars.
