This company is fantastic, my thanks to Jose, Sergio, Luis & Francisco, all family members what a truly reliable, informative, hard working family.
They did a beautiful job on installing carpet, putting in tile and it was cost effective, no rip offs with this family.
What a pleasure, I would highly recommend them.

This is one of the best companies in Vegas.
They're prices are very reasonable ( better than H&M and Allied flooring) and they always have what you want.
They're also   nice people and very courteous,  specially Don Jose.

They are the best!!
