Damn good coffee!
Great lunch and specials.

they have the best lemon bars ive ever had     and there baklava and penut butter fudge is great       my friend said they had the best turkey sandwich

It is so nice to have such a place in our neighborhood.
The lemon bars ARE great, and we also enjoy their brownies and other baked goods.
Recently with the heat we have become fans of their Berry Smoothies - goes just as good with a lemon bar as the coffee!
Friday and Saturday nights include live music, always a good time with good people.
Tonight's special was pizza, yummy with Kalamata olives and more.
Couldn't pass up ice cream so brought home for later a pistachio nut and coconut pineapple ice cream sundae with strawberry topping, and nuts...
I think now is later...

Kindred Spirits has closed their doors.
It is a sad thing that we on the west side of Phoenix cannot support such a friendly and community oriented business, AND one that gave you the option to drop by for a quick coffee or for a more complete dining experience.
The live music on the weekends was also something a bit rare for our side of town, and will be missed.
Richard and Debra did a marvelous job updating the space, and making it a warm and welcoming place.
I am sorry that Youngtown has lost this business.

Looks can be deceiving.
From the outside it doesn't look great, but inside the food is excellent.
Best coffee in town.
