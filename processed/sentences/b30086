A few of my friends used Shake It Up for parties they hosted and I was impressed with the how professional, but not stuffy, the bartenders were.
All the guests at these events had rave reviews.
I decided to use them for the 30th birthday party I was throwing for my husband and his best friend.
We were expecting about 30 people, so I wanted a bartender to set a somewhat upscale mood and reduce the stress on us as hosts.
Booking was effortless and they worked with us to make sure we had a bartender that would mesh well with our guests.
Daneel showed up on time and was outstanding!
A true professional bartender, she even made a couple birthday shots for everyone based on the liquor we had and everyone raved at how good they were.
I will not hesitate to use Shake It Up for the next party.

We used Shake It Up (Chris, specifically) for my 40th birthday, and he was perfect for the event.
Chris did a great job mixing the drinks on the menu we created.
He kept up with a thirsty crowd all night (~ 35 people) with multi-ingredient cocktails (think black cherry manhattans, not rum and cokes)!
He was very personable with our guests, yet unobtrusive.
Arrived early to set up and his departure was not disruptive at all.
Very communicative owner, and planning for the event was easy.
Price was reasonable, and we will be using Shake It Up (and requesting Chris) for other medium-to-large parties we throw.
Seriously, use them.
We could not have been happier with how it turned out.
