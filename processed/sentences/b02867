LUNCH REVIEW ONLY: Busy, busy, busy.
Short staffed.
I used to go at lunch for the 5.99 soup and salad deal.
Started out great, but now you get a cup of soup and a tiny bowl of salad for each serving, and they tend not to stop by often to check on you.
Realistically, you get 1 refill, as they are very slow getting seconds from the kitchen.
Recently, lunchtimes have been absolutely packed.
I tried to go last week, but there was a 15 minute wait for a table, and I only saw 3 or 4 servers in the entire restaurant.
No thanks!
We went elsewhere.
Admittedly I have had good service there at lunch, but not recently,  and the few occasions I have gone for dinner have been OK too.

Had a free lunch there for Veterans day.
I forgot how good the food is and how quick the service was.
Yes, even for free lunch it was quick and pleasant.

We have tried this Applebees twice and will never eat here again.
The first time the service was horrible and the food was o.k.
The second and last time the food was not even edible.
I had the chicken tenders and the were over cooked to the point that they were dry and DARK BROWN.
I got a very very small amount of fries as if thats all they had left.
My girlfriend had the riblets and they were disgusting to the point that she did`nt have more than one bite.
when the server came by she did`nt ask how things were.
When we asked for the check she asked if we needed a box for the food and when we declined she did`nt ask if there was a problem.
If we had`nt had a gift card I would have refused to pay but at that point we just wanted to leave.

Okay now this is a large chain and on average it's okay to good!
and I have been to this place many, many times, but I have to say the last time I went there for the happy hour hot wings (they were dry, over cooked) then I had ordered a steak and seafood combo (Cajun) something but after my second brew I thought it was me, so I had the wife and my son taste it man was it salty!!!!
It tasted like they dropped the salt shaker in the food, but my waitress assured me that could not have happened "because all there sauces come in bags and are pre-made" (Gross, that did it for me) I  was outta there with the quickness...

I think most would agree, the reason for eating at a chain restaurant is "consistency!
"  Unfortunately, this location doesn't get it.
With them, "life IS like a box of chocolates..."  The food is edible to bad, the bartenders couldn't produce two identical Bloody Mary's if their lives depended on it, the waiters don't know whether to stand or crouch to take orders, your table is never cleared regardless how full of dishes, and worst of all - you are either "Dude or Hon!
"  Stay home!
Don't go!
If you live in the area and need a late night bite, there's a Denny's about one-half mile west on Chandler Blvd.
Yes, I know Denny's isn't the best either - but breakfast for dinner is never bad!

well i am regular and i get what i want when i want all girl good and included the guy.
can't be better happy hours to drink.
1.65 bottle budlite plus thursday and saturday kareoke for free.

I've eaten at Applebees on rare occasion.
It has never been any place I sought out.
In this case they had the advantage that they were not a McDonald's or Burger King, and they were open very late.
I had the 7oz sirloin.
It was adequate.
Nothing special.
A little dry, and a bit gristley.
The mashed potatoes were nice, and the garlic broccoli was fine.
The onion rings were fine.
Nothing special.
The breading was nice, but didn't have much flavor.
The others seemed to like their wings and the pasta dish they had.
I was told "three stars" when I asked about them.
But I just can't go to three stars on this one.
You might argue me up to 2.5 stars, but that's not an option on Yelp.
My wife did say the strawberry margarita was good (I didn't drink it).
If you have no choice, this place is OK.  Food is adequate, they have a happy hour, and they are open very late.
One of the better "last resort" options around midnight.

I go to this Applebee's for Happy Hour...
I have gone for dinner, but Happy Hour is definitely my pull.
Either way, it's average... it's Applebee's.
We tend to sit at the bar, but we'll go out of our way to sit in Brandy's section if she's not bar tending!
Brandy is the reason we choose this Applebee's for Happy Hour over some of the many other choices around town.

When ever I come to this Applebee's it is packed, but I always get great service, I read several of the other reviews and don't know why most are low scored posts.
I know a lot of people that come here on Thursday night for Karaoke and they have many positive things to say about this location, especially some of the staff being very attentive.
Come on those of you out there that love this place, give them there props.

Though the service is always cheery, they messed up my order (for the third time) and I had SERIOUS acid reflex (for the first time in my life) because of the "Cajun Shrimp Pasta" and I didn't even eat half of it.
I am in extreme pain and writing this review at nearly 2 am because I can't sleep.
I am from Louisiana.
Southern food doesn't hurt me.
This is painful.

Well, after their remodel the place no longer smells like a toilet!
And they did some other things right too.
The food - definitely stepped up at least a notch if not two.
I go here for their unlimited soup/ salad combos.
They have regular and premium salads(in smaller portions) which are unlimited, and you can swap and try different combos of soups and salads.
($5.99 and $7.99 I believe are the prices for the regular salads vs premium salads).
Premium gets your the asian salad, spinach bacon and something else.
I like they added low-calorie/ more WW friendly items too which are pretty tasty.
I tried their jalapeno shrimp grilled plate which was flavorful but not spicy.
And I like spicy.
So for all the bland people this is probably more aimed for you.
I'd put it as a 1 chilli from Arribas or the baja spicy from Macayo's... doesn't touch los dos though with a pinky though.
The beer is still ice cold, and although they changed their prices recently (they were super low for their re-model/re-opening thing) they are still really good for happy hour.
There are a lot of regulars here for happy hour from what I've seen which can get loud.
Overall they've taken a step away from their old drive bar scene and brought it back to a decent place to eat and have a good time.

Decided to stop by for a burger, Cowboy burger in fact.
The wait service was good, no complaints; the restaurant itself was OK, no complaints; the burger was salty, over cooked and dried out...simply terrible!!
I may go back occasionally to Applebee's but not for the Cowboy burger.

I ate here the day before yesterday with my son and my grandmother.
We were the first patrons for the day.
My son had the mini cheeseburgers with french fries and my grandmother and I ordered the same dish.
Sirloin steak (medium rare) with shrimp, garlic mashed potato's and a side of broccoli.
I've decided that I'm going to do a celebrity style point review for this one-enjoy.
Waiter was nice and gave us a lot of attention.
(+10points) Strangely, he never once offered to refill our drinks.
(- A gagillon points!!!!!
Just kidding.
-8points) Our food came out very quickly.
(+7points) Our steaks came out medium well not medium rare-like we ordered.
(-11points) Everything else on the dish was delicious and flavorful especially the broccoli.
(+15 points) **I'm not kidding here the side dishes were excellent I was taken aback by the balance of garlic and other spices in my food.
I was bummed I didn't have one of those "my God!
" portioned sized plates...mmm, okay, onward.
The dishes were reasonably priced (+8points) My entire entree was under 550 calories which I guess, is good.
(+3points)  I would definitely eat here again, but from what I've read I'm not the first person to experience meat not cooked to what was specified.
It would seem all the cooks at this location understand is kinda done and really done.
Which, for me, means that I won't go here for steak but I will enjoy Vegetarian dishes or seafood.
Also, if you do stop by try the raspberry tea it was really delicious.
Oh, and one more thing I don't care to figure out how many points that came out too, so if you want to brush up on your arithmetic...no?
Okay.

Started coming to this location regularly about a month ago, and to be honest my Applebee's virginity was taken here and every visit does not disappoint!
Good food, good atmosphere, and very friendly service!
