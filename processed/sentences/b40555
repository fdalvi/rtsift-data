This place is awesome!
They have great products and a great staff!
They're all very knowledgeable and professional.
I will definitely be returning.

Hands down the best dispensary in my area (Gilbert, AZ).
I have tried other places, but this place always has me coming back.
The atmosphere and service is awesome.
I am usually in and out fairly quickly.
All of their meds are high quality and have fair prices, including their strain of the week!
The staff here are extremely helpful and welcoming.
It might be hard at first to locate the place, but it's easily accessible.
I recommend this place if you're looking for a professional and welcoming atmosphere.
Thank you H4L!

This place is legit!
It's very nice and the employees are so educated!
Plus the wide variety of product is great too!

Wonderful dispensary, always has a great staff and awesome meds, nothing less that 100% customer satisfaction.
My first choice 10 times out of 10!

Horrible on all counts got lots to complain about especially those Virginia slims you call Pre rolls.
What a rip believe me  I noticed a huuge change when ownership changed
