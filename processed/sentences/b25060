A great cut at a great price!
I am always a little leary of trying out a new barber (I am fairly new to the razor cut), but rest assured this place is professional and it's one of the best cuts I've had.

I came here with the kiddos like 4 weeks ago and I really liked how they cut their hair.nice little place in the corner of val vista and southern.

Worst barber shop EVER!
Save yourself the money and hassle of having to get your hair re-cut somewhere else after visiting here.
Rude!
Untalented!
There really is nothing good to say about this place.
Terrible.
Stat away.

I been coming here for about 3 years and they been great for most part, mainly because of Marcella ( I think that was her name).
Always was a great cut and gave like 20 /30 min awesome massages.
She left in December 13 and it has gone down hill ever since.
I got my haircut about every 3 weeks .
