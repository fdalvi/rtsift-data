Great selection that keeps getting better.
Is easily becoming my favorite place for vinyl in the Valley!

great selection!
friendly and all about the music!

Matt is a cool guy!
lots of japanese imports!
price of wall stuff is closer to ebay than reality but he is reasonable and willing to make a deal.
Good to see a new shop.
