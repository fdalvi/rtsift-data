Did I mention the staff is incredible?

Stayed here over 4th of July with family.
Not to many people staying then, so, it's kind of hard to judge if the walls keep noise from other rooms out.
Staff is friendly, clean, nice pool and hot tub.
Wi-Fi is free.
Rooms are small, but comfortable.
Price was fair.
Breakfast is expensive, went off property to eat.
Air conditioning was loud at night, didn't complain, don't know if they could have  fixed it .
Madison is a quick 10-15 min drive.
If your travels take you to Madison, I suggest checking this place out.
