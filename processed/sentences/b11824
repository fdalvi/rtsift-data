Never been before so I thought I'd try it out...Its kinda sorta like a subway, but their hook is that they slice their meats to order......WOW!!!!!
People behind the counter looked miserable doing what they were doing...
I ordered a turkey pastrami with everything which was okay, but I still prefer Subway or Capriotti's...they also definitely give you better service for sure...ALOHA!!

port of subs.....   sliced meat fresh in front of you to edge them out over subway....
They have changed their menus since I have last been in there....
I ordered a small Blackforest Ham with provolone on Wheat with spicy mustard... it was great and exactly what I was looking for for lunch.
I think the price was sub 4 bucks too which was also a bonus.
There was kind of a long line and it was understaffed considering the time of day it was (lunch)    all in all, it was a great experience and I would go back to this particular one again should I need a quick bite.

This is the 2nd Port of Subs I have dined in at and the service is not so great.
The first location I went to was on 215/Decatur.
Horrible service as well.
I ordered the pulled pork BBQ sandwich.
The sandwich maker didn't ask what kind of bread, rather she assumed I wanted wheat, she didn't ask if I would like t toasted.
I notice the lettuce and veggies were old, brown and soggy so I asked if they had a new batch to serve and she said " no just cause it has a few browns in the lettuce, it's still good".
I was like nevermind you ignored my question and just made my sandwich feel less appetizing.
She went on to making 3 other people's sandwiches before asking if that's all i wanted and if I was dinning in or to-go.
I just don't understand Port of Subs  employment standards but I think I'm going back to Eating Fresh at Subway!
