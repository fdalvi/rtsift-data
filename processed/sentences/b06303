Located around the corner from Highland Falls Golf Course, I like to stop by this location to grab a quick bite before a round of golf.
I really like the Sausage Biscuit Sandwich here.
They always get my order right and are fast.
I don't ask for much from my fast food restaurants....ha!
Will I return?
As long as I'm golfing, there's a good chance.

Always very friendly here :)

This location is no longer in business.
It has been closed for several months.
I'm a little surprised they closed, as every time I was there they had customers, the majority of whom were seniors from Sun City.
Granted I was there at breakfast/lunch time, I have no idea how busy they were at night.
