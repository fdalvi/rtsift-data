Its your average Chili's.
Predictable and a great option when you don't want to think about it!!
Located very close to the Country Inn we stayed at, it's a dependable place to eat with great service.
Our waitress Rose was fast and cheerful.
I had shrimp on a Mediterranean salad.
It was good but for those who don't like a sweet dressing, maybe substitute something more savory (my husband hates sweet dressings.
When he asked how my dinner was I remarked, "You'd hate it!
")   The kids loved their sliders and the baby loved sampling bits of steak from my husband's fajitas.
I wished we'd had space for dessert but, alas, we did not.
Keep the blackberry iced tea on your list of good drinks to try.
After all, In Phoenix come June, you're going to need them!

I had my baby-back ribs, service was alright, ribs were a little dry.

Went here Thursday might after attending a meeting, There was 16 of use in the party.
We wanted a comfortable, non-fast food, restaurant.
So we picked this place.
Our waitress Sam was fabulous, professional, courteous.
Really for waiting on such a large group she exceeded our expectations (Totally unexpected) Everyone ordered something different and asked for separate checks.
She checked on us frequently and refilled our drinks promptly.
In addition everyone ordered something different and asked for separate checks.
For a casual chain restaurant I was impressed.
The food is exactly what you would expect from a Chili's Restaurant.
Average.
You know what you're going to get no matter what location you go to.I normally don't prefer to eat at chains (though I will on occasion so I didn't have high expectations.
I mean there is never a wow factor at a neighborhood chain restaurant.
It is however a decent place to get a hot meal.
They have a nice variety at reasonable prices Basically their menu offers something for everyone.
The service is  friendly and efficient.
And this location appeared to be very clean.
I had started off with a dinner salad.
For my entr√©e I had the grilled salmon.
It was ok but nothing special.
I asked to substitute broccoli for a different side and was accommodated no problem.
As for everyone else there was no complaints.
Plus all our food orders came out quickly   =========================== SMALL  GLITCH ====================== There was several people in our party that qualified for their senior discount.
When  we received our bills it wasn't on them.
So we inquired about it and was old they don't do senior discounts on such a large party.
After voicing our opinion regarding this matter and stating then we wouldn't be back those who qualified were given the discount.
FOOD:  I have never had a meal that was not to my satisfaction.
PRICE: Very reasonable.
SERVICE:  Fast, friendly service.
Very personable, Sam kept our soda and iced tea filled to the brim.
CONCULSION:  An alright place to go to hang out and chat with friends & eat some alright food  RETURN  FACTOR: Won't be my first choice to go here but I'll return.
RETURN FACTOR: 100%

================== RETURN VISIT UPDATE ==================  Came again Thursday night after a meeting I attended with nine other people.
It was the same group of people I went with in my first review of this establishment.
The group was seated right away and our drink orders were taken.
So why the low rating?
Why?
Because I ordered the Mango-Chile Tilapia.
I took one bite and thought it was terrible.
If you've seen my other reviews I normally like Tilapia so it wasn't the fish it was how the fish was prepared.
It was cooked fine but the Mango-sauce with avocados on top was not appetizing.
At this point everyone in our party was served and enjoying their meals.
I was waiting for the waitress to come around and ask if anyone needed refills or how was their food, But she was nowhere to be found.
When she finally did come around everyone was just about finished with their meals.
Then she asks about how everyone's food was.
So I told her.
Someone who I assume was a manger comes over and asks if I wanted her to have my meal recooked.
At first I said no I just wanted it taken off my bill.. because everyone was already done.
After awhile I reluctantly agreed to having my meal recooked without the mango sauce TO-GO..Upon reflection I should have asked for the meal to be comp'd and be done with it.
FOOD: The food is exactly what you would expect from a Chili's Restaurant.
:  SERVICE: I must admit for a large group we did receive good service.
PRICE: The price  for the quality of food you receive is OK. AMBIANCE: It's like every other Chili's.
CONCLUSION: When this sort of thing happens I don't know about you but it can completely ruin your dinning experience.
I mean nothing ruins my mood easier than a poor meal when I'm expecting something much better.
How I respond depends on my mood and on the circumstances.
I didn't appreciate the waitress not returning to our table for such a long time because this whole experience could have been avoided.
RETURN FACTOR 50-50....%.

DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH

This place is pretty bad.
I have never seen a restaurant with such great looking food on the menu deliver such lousy food.
Service is not genuine.
Burgers are greasy and disgusting along with the steaks.
Avoid this place no wonder how good the 2 for $20 sounds.
Used to be a fan of Chili's before.
What happened?

I have to admit, it is one of the nicest Chili's I have been to in quite some time.
Albeit it was a Sunday afternoon so it was a smidge slower than say a Friday night, it was still a nice.
The chips we had for the chips and salsa were warm and delicious and the lighter fare chicken salad was excellent.
One of the waitresses however seem to be having a bad day as it appeared she was in some type of disagreement with one of her tables.
I actually felt bad for her because like everyone else, I couldn't help but stop and stare like everyone else.
All in all, we will be back again soon.

I came here once and tried their chipotle steak it was yummy but didn't last long because within a month it wasn't even on the menu.
Came there a second time and got a bowl, it's very small (maybe have the size of the chipotle burrito bowl :/) so it didn't fill me up.
I preferred chipotles bowl over this.
