They played a huge game with me trying to up-sell the extra shampoo service that would have doubled the price.
Made it seem like not using the extra service would be no better than not getting the carpets cleaned at all.
He even called his supervisor to very loudly (so I could hear him) state how surprised he was that I wasn't going to do the extra service.
If it's so important why don't you bring it up in the quote I asked for over the phone?
Would not recommend.
