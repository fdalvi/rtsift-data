I got my oil changed in 30 minutes.
It was quick, painless, and I wasn't "hussled".
They mentioned I would want to replace something but they didn't try and force me to do it then and there.
I also got my oil change through groupon so it was nice to see a big company like Midas giving out discounts!

I got my oil changed here.
Found a coupon on the midas website and figured I would give them a try.
My car has always gone to the dealer for service but lately they are going downhill.
I was pleasantly surprised by this location.
They are very courteous and checked a few things on my car.
Didnt try to upsell me, just stated the facts.
It did take a while for my oil change to be done thats the reason for four and not five stars but overall a good experience.
I will be visiting them again.

came into town with an unidentified problem.
we use midas in California all the time, so hoped this would be a good fit.
we gave the manager our latest paperwork, she spoke with the ca.
manager, had the mechanics take a look, and in half an hour we were on our way.
thanks for taking care of a couple of out-of-towners!
