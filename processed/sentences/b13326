I got me some Paper denim jeans on sale here for $45, an English Laundry tee and some Donald J Pliner shoes for half off - and ever since I was hooked.
Roka is a small mens/womens boutique in the Arrowhead AJ's shopping center - heavy on the denim with shirts, sweaters, belts and shoes.
The owners are friendly and offer guests water and candy when you're shopping (or maybe it's just me).
Every so often they'll have a steal of sale - including their denim sales in February.
Who says you have to hoof it to Scottsdale for fancy duds?

I love going to Roka, especially when they have sales on Jeans.
They have a small very personal boutique with a great little variety of clothes that I usually love....my problem is not buying to much.
One year they had jean 50% off and I went nuts and bought 4-5 pair of designer jeans.
The shirts are always soft and cool looking.
I have not been by in a while but I need to since my clothing selection is depleting badly, worse than my bank account.
