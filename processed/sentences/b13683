This review is for 06/11/2011.
When you leave home, don't forget that there is a high probability that you forgot something.
I did forget something and I needed to get it fast.
With the handy, dandy GPS, I found a 24 hour Walgreens just near my motel.
The location of this Walgreens is on the east side of the 17 Freeway on the intersection of Northern and 19th Ave.
I felt like home if I see a Walgreens.
The building design is universal and I knew where to get items without even looking.
This Walgreens was busier than the MetroCenter Mall to think about it.
I can't specify what item I was getting, but I got in and out fast.
A lot of the customers are the elderly.
I think I got a few stares since I was the only big, tall, Asian guy in the store.
At least, the staring reputation follows me from Los Angeles to Phoenix.
Not much of anything to write about this Walgreens, but I am glad to have found it.
I was in and out in less than two minutes without any problems.
On to the next review!!
The Yelp Universe.
Where are you traveling today?

Worst most incompetent pharmacy on the planet.
Twice, received a call that my script was in, only to be told when I got there that it could not be filled that day.
Arrogant snobs as well.

Nice location, convenient to our hotel.
Busy, but we were able to get through quickly.
Nice selection of drugs, snacks, drinks, and a limited grocery.
Prices are reasonable.
Good choice for those things you have forgotten while travelling.

Ghetto location, kind of dirty and the employees are not at all helpful.
If they can ignore you, they will.
