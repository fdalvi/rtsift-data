amazing food..they rolled out a new menu Friday 7/19/2013 the meatloaf is the most amazing I have ever tasted!!!
my compliments to the chef!!
we have been eating here for a bout 1 year now at least 2-3 times per week...we have never had a bad experience!
everyone treats you like family!!
truly a hidden gem!

Not sure I agree with Mike's 5 rating, but the food was good.
Tucked out of the way, the place is impossible to casually stumble across.
But, the food was good.
and the service was very good.
They do close early on Monday evenings, or so it seemed.
Might just be a summer schedule.
Noise level can be loud near the bar area, but there is a dining area off the main area that is quieter.
Well worth another visit.
Note:  I gave it a loud noise level because of loud golfers coming in and dinking and trying to outshout each other.
But, if you move to the other room I suspect it will be much quieter.
Just don't know how attentive the service will be out there (out of site, out of mind?

Had the sunrise special breakfast today.
Amazing value, friendly staff, good atmosphere, slow service,  Definitely recommend
