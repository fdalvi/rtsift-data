I have used this cleaners (dry cleaning and alterations) for four years even though I moved to the north end of the valley three years ago!
Suzy and Sonny are always friendly and personable.
Great customer service.

I love this place!
I have has some clothes in pretty bad shape that they were able to make look like new.
They are reasonably priced and have excellent customer service.
I wouldn't go anywhere else!

We called ahead to make sure they were able to dry clean our two shirts on time before the following afternoon.
They were fast and friendly during drop-off and pick-up, but when my boyfriend put on the shirt after flying out of town the next day we realized it hadn't been cleaned at all.
There were still underarm stains and full body odor on the shirt despite the shirt being pressed nicely.
Perhaps they didn't have time and didn't care to tell us because we mentioned we had a flight to catch the next day so they assumed we weren't locals.
It was a bizarre experience and we will not be using their service again.

Took two suits and two dress shirts.
Not only did they get everything cleaned in less than 36 hours, but they also got the champagne stains out of one of the suits and fixed my coat button for no charge.
Really nice and very professional.
My go to cleaning spot in town.
