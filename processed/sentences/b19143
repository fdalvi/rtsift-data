What an adorable store!
Completely dedicated to dogs -- cute little outfits and wonderful treats.
The girl working there had her cute little dog all dressed up in a pink little puppy shirt and sparkly collar.
I'd never do that to my dog (he's too scruffy for that!
), but I saw so many adorable outfits I was sorely tempted...
Located around the corner from Coach, it is absolutely adorable!
Service was friendly and prompt -- can't ask for anything more in a retail store.

They have Yappy Hour on Thursdays from 6-8 pm, during which they run a buy one get one free special on select treats.
This is the only time I come and stock up for the dogs.
They also give you a card that they punch every time you make a purchase of $10 or more that allows you to eventually get $10 off your purchase of $10 or more.
Yappy Hour is also a great time to for my dog to socialize and they give away some free treats.

Let me preface by saying the store is a cool little store for dogs but..........Probably an off day today or something but we came to this location last year while on vacation and the staff was fantastic...friendly, gave attention to our little guy and let us try a sample behind the counter...then we purchased a good amount of treats and toys.
This tiime the staff didn't even say hi...i guess the reason why we pay so much for the treats is not because of quality but for the friendly interaction b/w us and the store...my dog would be just as happy with a twenty five cent treat from petsmart then a $2 specialty treat from Just Dogs....I always give places 2nd chances but if i get the same customer service as this last time I probably wouldn't spend my money there again.
