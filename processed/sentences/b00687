New to a city and need car repairs- is my middle name.
Its hard not being a car guy but having your own and you're wives car to take care of.
I always feel like I cant trust anyone who has the ability to repair anything on our vehicles since I wouldn't know any better.
I need an oil change fast so I took in my VW Jetta.
The guys we're really friendly.
Read a lot of mixed reviews all over and talked to the manager about them when I got there.
They fixed Thompson (my car) up real nice and no problems after like I was nervously expecting.
I'd go there again.

I'm surprised to see a review claiming they don't seem honest!
The guys here never try to upsell me and have actually taken a few minutes here and there to educate me on car stuff (yes "car stuff" - I am a girl, I know very little about cars, and I'm a magnet for people who try to take advantage) and let me know that I actually DON'T need certain things done.
Example: I needed a new tire and it was one they didn't carry in stock.
After trying to locate an affordable one, they let me know it would be much cheaper to just go to Discount Tires myself than try to buy through them because the only ones available through vendors were expensive.
I have since purchased a new car that gets free service at the dealership for a while..and I have to say, I miss Midas.
The people here are friendly and efficient - very unusual and hard to find in my experiences with Firestone, Discount Tires, Sears, etc etc etc!
Thanks, Midas at 7th St!

If you are looking for a good spot to get a great oil change.. this is your spot.
They are super friendly, have never tried to "sell" me all the extras that you sometimes get when you take your car in for an oil change.
Their oil change is very extensive as well.
You can usually grab a coupon online for $22 for the complete oil change.
