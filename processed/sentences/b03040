The best $5 dollar Chinese food around!
I come here regularly for their lunch specials.
You can get a very tasty Mongolian beef dish with white rice, egg roll or crab puff for under $5.
They have about 14 lunch specials to choose from or the extensive a la cart menu.
It's no frills dinning at its best.

I stumbled upon this treasure using my AroundMe app one night when my boyfriend and I were looking for delivery Chinese.
My family and I have been frequenting Shangri-La in the Metrocenter area for over 20 years and this may have topped it!
Queen's Bowl checked all our boxes: option for delivery, authentic taste, soup available, and at a most valuable price.
We will make this a regular spot.
An absolute must!

Great food and at an affordable price!
$25 fed my family of 5 :) And my wife loved it..."It's just what I have been looking for!
And it hit the spot!!

Was looking for a good local Chinese restaurant that delivered and this place did!
Best egg rolls I've had in a long time and the orange chicken & Mongolian beef was great too!
This is our new fave :)

Love Queens Bowl.
Good quality food at a good price.
Their service is friendly and fast.

The food here is decent, and they offer a good value.
They have been in that location for more than 25 years, so they must be doing something right.
