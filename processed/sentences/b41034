Came in with no appointment on a Monday afternoon.
I was seen in about 10 minutes with no problems.
The staff was very friendly and the wait was very short once I was in the room.
Very clean and I will definitely skip the urgent care and go here.
Very convenient hours and I was happy to see they are open on weekends as well.

Worst place ever.
Sat in the office for 2 hours for my annual physical and the doctor had me reschedule it.

I had a pretty fantastic experience at My Dr. Now.
I have had some PRETTY horrible luck with doctors in my past and present, so I was pleasantly surprised with how my appointment went.
I was well taken care of by a nurse of sorts and then placed in a room, with a minimal wait, and my doctor was FABULOUS!
I will most definitely be returning, because of the proximity to my home, and how well this appointment went.

I absolutely love this office and am so glad it's super close to my house.
I have seen Dr. Trinidad twice now and he is very personable and has a great bed side manner.
He's genuinely caring and very easy to talk to.
Lisette is a great tech/nurse.
She is very easy going and if you have had a hard time with people poking you several times, trying to find a good vein, you don't have to worry about this with her.
She's excellent, takes her time, and puts you at ease.

Its convenient since its near my house but to wait an hour to for the  the doctor to arrive is the worst thing ever.
Iam reconsidering coming back in here.
Not only i waited for 1 hour-_-, i also arrived 30 minutes before my time..oh btw iam still waiting.
I will update what will happen in this horrible experience.

I've bee to this location three times, the most recent visit was earlier this morning.
I think they have good service, they got me and my daughter in fairly quickly.
The doctor was nice, we both got antibiotics.
Clean place, new.
Overall I would recommend.
