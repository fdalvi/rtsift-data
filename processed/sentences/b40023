Walking back from a running event in Holyrood Park, I stumbled upon this great new location for Oink.
It just opened today and isn't just a popup for the festival -- it's here to stay to bring a delicious quick lunch alternative to Holyrood!
Although the location is small, it has slightly more seating than the original location on Victoria Street.
It has the hog roast in one window and a great big table by the other window, and fresh new decor.
My oink sandwich with crackling, sage and onion stuffing and apple chutney was delicious as always.
The staff are super friendly and welcoming, too.
As always with Oink, when the hog roast is gone it's gone for the day!
I'm thrilled to see they have this new convenient location and the same great food.

This satellite Oink has about a thousand times more space than the original, and while it doesn't quite enchant as much, it's still one hell of a place.
It doesn't get any better than an Oink on brown bread with stuffing and BBQ sauce.

Good news everyone!!!
There are now 2 Oinks!!
That's right, every day 2 whole pigs are being sacrificed in the name of pulled pork rolls!
I'm sure we can all agree its a noble cause well worth it.
Give me pork, stuffing, crackling and apple sauce on a roll and well you have the perfect lunch!!
Now with this second shop with seating near my office I am well catered for at lunchtime!!!
Hmmmm Pork Rolls come highly JD Recommended!

Great and affordable food.
I had the pulled pork on a brown roll with onion stuffing and barbecue sauce...YUMMMM.
The pork was juicy and the barbecue sauce met my 'Merican standards.
:) Try the root beer too, it's delish.
(Only Â£9 for lunch for two!
