Located in the lobby of the Hilton Suites in downtown Phoenix, I was fully unimpressed with their hotel restaurant.
In contrast to the beautiful atmosphere of the restaurant, the food was pretty lousy.
From my room I could just smell the bacon in the morning so I had to come downstairs and give this place a try.
The restaurant is buffet style for breakfast.
The food was barely warm and hard as a rock.
The quality of the food was much worse than the free breakfasts that come complimentary at other hotel chains such as La Quinta.
At least the service was good.
I think they refilled my drink after each sip I took!
They must have known I was going to need it to wash that food down.
I'll give 2 stars only because the service was great and the atmosphere was pleasant.

Bethany and Michelle are wonderful hosts and very accommodating.
The hotel is located just north of the downtown area and has a beautiful bar area.
Food is delicious and the peach ginger soda is amazing!
