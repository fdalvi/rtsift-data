Nice place that opened not too long ago in the Maryvale area.
It has TONS of desserts on the menu, lots of little snacks, and is complemented by a small menu of Mexican junk food like chimichungas, carne asada fries, or sonoran hot dogs.
When I first came here, I thought their take on the hot food available was unsatisfying, but as a work in progress they are making leaps and bounds in the right direction.
Last time I came here my food was tasty!
It has a bit of an identity crisis, however.
Is it a restaurant?
Is it a dessert shop?
They do it all, but I haven't had anything that stood out yet.
They'll keep getting better, and I'll update my review accordingly.
Until then, I'll be stuffing my face with some fresas con crema.
Yum!

I was very impressed by the nice staff and the morning Chorizo Burrito was so very tasty.

Good food, love to stop by for coconut with lime and chili powder/sauce.
Reasonable prices.
Open until 9pm
