I've been occasionally impressed with home entertainment set-ups found in some of my more affluent mate's houses.
This was nothing compared to the uber high quality gear available in Bang & Olufsen's pad.
Walking into what sounded like the climax of a Michael Buble concert, I witnessed a truly impressive HD image of the man bellowing his squeaky clean jazzy voice to an audience of thousands.
Ordinarily I'd snub Mr. Buble, but the Bang & Olufsen set up propelled his performance into a high quality band and proved to be something pretty special to witness.
Super modern and unique designs all add to the 'wow' factor but as expected so do the 4 didget price tags.

I've you're looking to set up a high quality entertainment system and you've got the money to back your ambition then this is most certainly the place to come.
The stuff here really is of high quality and I'm not sure if you could beat it for quality elsewhere.
Even if you could get better quality elsewhere I fail to see how much better quality you would notice.
Everything you need for a comprehensive system is likely to be found here, so if you have the money it's well worth a look, but it is worth price checking with James Morrow just down the road.
