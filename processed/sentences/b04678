The staff at this location is always very friendly.
I feel comfortable bringing my animals here.
They're also very quick to accommodate appointments.
I would recommend them.

I am visiting the area and away from my regular vet.
I selected the vet clinic that was closest to where I'm located and I had a great experience!
The front desk was very helpful and when I went back to see if the vet she did a thorough exam and I had many recommendations for me.
once I chose a treatment she was supportive with my decision.
When the exam was over I had some additional questions and the vet immediately came back to the room to answer all of my questions.
This location is very cost-effective and very friendly.

After misdiagnosing my cat and spending over $230 on unnecessary treatment in May 2013, I had to take my cat to the Emergency Clinic only to spend another $1,000 there.
My cat is now on a special diet and needs a prescription so that I can purchase his food.
I asked VCA El Mirage to work with me on the cost of his annual visit and I would bring in all 3 of my cats.
I guess money is more important than the health of my pets.
VCA wants $80+ for an annual visit and immunizations.
You can visit TLC - Value Pet Clinic at the local pet stores and pay $48 for all of the immunizations (including Rabies) AND a check-up!
Contact TLC at (480) 699-9950.
I also learned that it's much cheaper to purchase the prescription cat food online at chewy dot com.
Not only is the cost of the food cheaper, but they have free shipping on orders $49+.
