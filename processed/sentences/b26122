brought in a few pieces here after finding a coupon on the back of my smith's recipe.
half off an order of $50 plus.
took it in on a tuesday and told it would be ready by 5 the next day.
came in thursday afternoon to find out they couldn't get the stain out of one of my sweaters (darn chocolate) and it was missing a button.
Also, one of the shirts wasn't ready yet.
(a day after it was suppose to be.
) i said i'd let them try and find the button and come back the next day with hopes of everything being done.
i ended up not making it back for a few days, but when i came back for all of my clothes everything was in tack but that darn chocolate stain and they found the missing button and sewed it back on.
whew!
i didn't want to put up an arguement.
it came to around $27 dollars after my coupon for a blazer, a long dress, 2 sweaters, and 3 or 4 tops.
i was impressed with how well my white oversized blazer looked.
i deducted a star for it not being ready on time though.

This place was quick and efficient to deal with but I have doubts about their quality.
Items were finished on time and neatly pressed but I don't think they were cleaned properly or thoroughly.
I don't know where they dryclean their garments but mine smelled rather rank after being cleaned.
So much so that I had to get them cleaned again.
Take your drycleaning elsewhere, both the drycleaning places in southern highlands are certainly lacking at best.

Anna, The Taylor, is fabulous.
She can help you out in a pinch and does great work.
Not sure of the dry cleaning thogh.
Taylor gets a 5 star from me.

Anna is absolutely wonderful!
She is such a sweetheart and very knowledgeable.
Skilled in her craft, I have never experienced a late alteration from Maple Cleaners.
Truly a pleasure to work with.
