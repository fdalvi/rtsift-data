As good as any other Panda Express.

Consistently good.
The idea behind Panda Express is simple but ingeniously cunning.
I wish I would have thought of the idea.
Great tasting Chinese food that's clean, fast and affordable.
I love P.E.
Make sure you fill out the surveys...free entree.

Good Tasty and Fresh.
Check out the Sugar Wontons.
Mm Those are addicting.

Was exceptionally clean!
Major problem- when we went in at 11:45 am for lunch- food trays were either empty or half empty- no customers in the store- the dishes that we wanted were not ready and had to make other selections for lunch..probably will not go back- due to the poor planning for lunch crowd!

The best Panda Express by far.
The location is nice, big and very clean.The staff are very friendly especially Paula!

Very fast & attentive service.
All menu items fresh & hot.
Samples offered.
Ordered 2 different combos: chow mein, mushroom chicken, beef n broccoli; fried rice, orange chicken, Beijing beef.
Also spring roll sides with sauce.
All good.

Quality Service and Cleanliness is great here.
The orange chicken is always must!!!
I miss the Mandarin Chicken but they have the new Teriyaki which is ok.
