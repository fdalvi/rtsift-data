I had a fabulous experience with Mattress Firm over on Marks St. by Walmart and Party City.
We had just bought a Sleep Number bed and it was making my back problems worse so we decided to try a store that sold a variety of beds to get more of an unbiased opinion on what we should be looking for.
They had several different brands of beds and various levels of firmness for each brand.
All in all, it was simply trial and error to find a bed that worked great for us and the hassle-free experience was wonderful.
Thanks Mattress Firm!

Recently, my fiance and I picked out a new mattress at this Mattress Firm.
The sales associate, Todd, was helpful without being pushy.
He was friendly, but not in a used car salesman sort of way.
He helped us pick the right option for us rather than pushing the most pricey options.
In the end, we went with a higher-end product than we would have otherwise because we really trusted his opinions and felt comfortable with the purchase.
This was a great customer service experience.
Five stars, definitely.

The sales associate was absolutely wonderful.
He was extremely knowledgable and friendly.
I didn't feel like he was pushing me to buy anything.
He walked me through sleep tests to determine which mattress I would love the most.
Extremely wonderful service.
Now I am laying on my new tempur pedic =)
