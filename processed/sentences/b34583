Typical Starbucks located in ASU Tempe campus's Memorial Union.
They do not serve the toasted breakfast sandwiches and don't accept certain Starbucks incentives/coupons.
Hours may vary with semester breaks and MU building closures.

A typical Starbucks but STAY AWAY from all Starbucks on campus.
For some reason they have the WORST service..

The blonde guy who works there is SO cute.
Happy baristas and quick service (which is surprising considering it is one of the busiest in the nation)!
