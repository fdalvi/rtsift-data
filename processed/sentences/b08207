Scans of tumors read as cancer.
Removed kidney that had non-cancerous tumor and did not let patient know the result of tissue samples for 2 weeks while you are sitting and waiting for cancer or no cancer.
Could not obtain result while in hospital (asked on numerous occasions) and  had to wait until followup appt.
After surgery,  did not meet with family (had busy schedule and had to leave) and hospital visits were always with unknown associates.
Not very in tune with a patient's need to know.
Surgery was done with hand assisted robot; good recovery time and seems competent in surgery and new techniques.
