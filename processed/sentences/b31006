I was checking out this Art district and there was live music with several studios in the area, I went over to the "Of The Earth Cafe" and out front there was a taco stand with the owner Shane grilling up street tacos.
I had both the beef and chicken and I have to say they were both great.
The chicken had a great seasoned flavor and he even made his own homemade green chili hot sauce that tasted so fresh and flavorful.
I heard that this area gets hopping ever first Friday but I decided to stop by after the Suns game and check it out last night.
Also ask about the sweet potato taco desert they have!

I was at The Rhythm Room and saw these cool people selling Tacos, so I checked it out.
It turned out to effen awesome.
Fresh quality food!
ChiChi- lisous!
Be on the look out for these guys!
Chow down baby.

Was out and about wanting to just have a beer with a friend on a Friday night and came about Chi Chi's Tacos right outside Lost Leaf on 5th.
Man oh MAN are they good!!
Had one of each and the Sweet Potato Tacos are to die for!!!
