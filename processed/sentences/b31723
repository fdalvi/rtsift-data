So this place was under another name from another fame, but the owner is the same.
(ha, crack myself up).
The food is way better, the space is way roomier, They have like 100 TV's and the fact they didn't kick me out on opening NFL Sunday because I was on my roller skates makes mama very happy.
I plan on going here for all the 1pm games for the rest of the season.
They are kid friendly too.
Can you say no babysitter needed, take 'em with ya.
They need their own roller skates tho.
FOOD: recommend the pretzels/mustard - the cooked kind.

Food: Not good.
Dry meat in my cheeseburger, greasy fries in a basket.
Burger fell apart into crumbs as I ate it.
The bun was a hard baguette that I had to tear the corners off to get to the burger.
Unfortunately I waited so long to receive it that I didn't feel like reordering.
Beer: Pretty good selection on tap and bottled.
Music: The worst.
A drummer was pounding on a drum along with top 40 stuff they were playing, it was so loud and distracting I just could wait to get out of there.
It was like listening to someone fail at Rock Band while listening to a teen-ager's iPod on full blast.
It's a shame, because Gilbert needs some better options for nightlife.
I was really hoping for a better experience.

I eat here all the time on my lunch break.
It is unique and unlike any other restaurant.
I went there last week and i think it was closed down.
