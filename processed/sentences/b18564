Ok so they had their grand opening and we hung out at The Norterra Shops all day.
I have been waiting for this place to open to take the kid.
I am not going to lie we went there 3 times I still didnt try all the flavors I had peanut butter creme, raspberry creme, and watermelon ice along w tasting a handful of other flavors every visit.
My tongue is back to normal but I dont suggest eating there 3 times in one day I think my tongue had frost bite.
But I will be back for more soon they make smoothies and a bunch of other stuff I had never been to an actual store before the staff was really nice too no matter how many things we tried or how many times I came in lol.

I dont think I will stop coming here the staff is really nice every time!
Even when my kiddo decides to spill an entire root beer float all over their nice floor.
If you go to the movies across the way I suggest going here first instead of spending an arm and a leg on drinks.
They make custom ice cream cakes, they have sundaes, fresh fruit smoothies, vitamin water, soda, tea and they even have energy drinks like red bull.
They have topping's, waffle's and cone's just like any other ice cream shop too.

My Hubby loves Dippin' Dots!
In high school, we used to get the vending machine packs at the movies all the time.
I ran in to get a to go order last night after dinner.
In the large containers I got birthday cake & mint chocolate.
It was as yummy as we remembered!
I definitely agree on the frost bite thing though, this stuff is so cold!!
We'll be back to try the other flavors such as peanut butter chip, cotton candy, & watermelon ice!
They even do cakes, I'm tempted to order one for an upcoming birthday.

I think it's a little pricey compared to some other ice cream places, but where else can you go to get dippin' dots.
The staff is always friendly and the place is kept clean.

CLOSED!
Another yogurt place moving in...
