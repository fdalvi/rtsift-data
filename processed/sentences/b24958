Did a walk through today..
The new management was awesome.
The reviews on apartment reviews have all changed drastically from good to better... take it from me... i rent in the area and wish i came here first.. i will be a resident soon!

True resort style living here and the don't seem to mind if you get hammered at the pool while watching the game on the 4 tv's they have in the cabana.
just don't fall asleep in the hot tub.
you WILL cook.

They have a new website:  http://www.baronproperties.com/community.aspx?id=163    I don't know if they got bought out, as long as they keep the great reviews, I'm glad.
