Let me say it, I Love subway...not this one.
Sadly its the closest one to my apt.
Last night though, made me wonder just a bit.
Went with a friend to get a sub.
I wasn't hungry, thank Jebus!
My friend ordered his sub and when we got to the counter the one employee says to the other: "what's that crawling on the floor" under his breath.
My friend and I pretended not to hear as we walk out...I so much wanted to turn around and hear what it was...but I feared I would loose my love for Subway... *sigh* I hope it was just...cricket or something from outside.
My friend said the food was great though...
I mean their store front was clean, everything looked fresh and tasty...just...can't stop thinking about the thing crawling on the floor...

So 1 hour before closing the chairs were already up and the soda machine was already off.
I ordered a tuna sandwich and went back home.
I have to say that this was the most disgusting sandwich I have ever had.
The bread was stale and the tuna was so salty, I ended up drinking a gallon of water.
I just threw the sandwich away.

My dad is a regular here, couple times a week anyway.
He loves the Seafood Sensation and not all SUBWAYS carry it.
Tonight we were greeted by Anthony and Tyler.
Anthony even recognized my dad as a regular who is normally not here this time of day.
Service was great and we are on a clean outdoor patio with pop music in the background.
SUBWAY is consistently good and delicious (except tonight they were out of Seafood Sensation).

Great service.
Very friendly and helpful workers.
They got my requests correct and very knowledgeable when I asked questions.
My new location.
