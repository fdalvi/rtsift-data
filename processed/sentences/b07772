Went to this location for 2 yrs for oil changes and occasional miscellaneous repairs with no problem.
Once I got a 'new" used car, I went in for oil change and for them to look it over and came away with a 4 page repair list!!!
I have never gone back there.
I have gone back to dealer as well as a Midas location to verify the things on the list, they did find 2 things wrong, neither was on Firestones 4 pages of repairs and everything that was in the 5 pages was total BS.....I have never gone back!

Brought my truck in for a second opinion on my auto a/c.
The first place I brought it to told me that I had cool components under the hood but none of it was getting into the cab.
I brought it to Firestone for a second opinion,  they said I needed to fix the entire a/c unit.
Brought it back to the first shop I went to and they said my a/c was no longer running cool under the hood.
I'm not an expert detective, but I suspect that my freon was drained at Firestone so they could add the extra service on.

I have had many issues with one of my cars--my "clunker" and wouldn't trust any one but Firestone to fix the issues.
I prefer this location because the work done is not only incredible, but the quality of customer service here is above and beyond all of my expectations.
I am always treated with kindness and respect, I really appreciate all of their hard work!
If you want good service and if you want to be treated with respect, I highly recommend you go to this Firestone!
