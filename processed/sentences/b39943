I recommend the Cantonese Noodles these are ala Monterey Park, Ca.
True authentic Chinese cuisine

First time in for lunch.
Clean dining room nice staff and generals chicken was really good.
Excellent value.
Give this a try!

OMG amazing!
Love this place, always fresh food and the best spring rolls I've ever had in my life lol
