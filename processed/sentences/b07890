The course was in decent shape but I do have some issues that take away from it's overall rating:  The need to have animal control come clean the 8-9 dogs off the course or make some sort of notice for the residents that the golf course is not their back yard.
We had  a total of 6 golf carts in one round of golf due to sticking gas pedals and breaks... this is a safety issue and made it impossible to get into a good grove.
They are in dire need of some good service on their golf carts.
The course was fun and in good shape, just wish the risk I took on groupon was a great deal, as opposed to a par outing.

My husband and his Buddy played golf here today.
They just over seeded, they should have informed them before they played.
According to my husband they had just over seeded and it was like putting on Shag Carpet.
Also the Golf Carts were VERY Loud.
He wont be going back there any time soon!

This was the only course with available tee times on a Saturday morning, so my buddies and I in from out of town tried it out.
The course was in terrible shape, it was really slow, the surrounding houses were full of yelling people and barking dogs, and there was even a kid riding his bike in the middle of the 9th fairway.
I gave it a generous two stars because it was pretty cheap, and I guess you get what you pay for.

Was great for price.
Greens and fairways were decent.
Price was only $60 including cart, green fees, and rental clubs.
For price alone, I thought it a decent bargain for sure.
I would be back.
