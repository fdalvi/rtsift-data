Friendly staff.
Fresh eats.
What's not to love?
Nom nom nom!

Just tried the Fritos enchilada melt.
Not a bad lunch.
Had to try it... Not sure Id get another one.
It gets a little busy during lunch so the staff just focuses on getting you in and out.
If i eat there i'll usually pick the meatball marinara or the buffalo chicken.
