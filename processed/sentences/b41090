I have used Power Tags a few times now.
They are very friendly, accommodating, and very knowledgeable.
Good convenience prices as well as conveniently located for us out here in the Southeast Valley.

I had never heard of a third party licensing option, so I was kind of leery when my friend recommended Power Tags, Titles & More.
However, the DMV sucks, and this place is right by my house, so I gave it a whirl - and I'm glad I did!
Staff is friendly, prices are fair (a few bucks more than the DMV).
My vehicle was completely licensed in less than 30 minutes.
The process was insanely simple, and I would recommend this place to everyone!
They don't do drivers licenses as of April 2014 but they said perhaps in the fall.

Great service and is much better than waiting at an endless line at the MVD!

Been here twice since I moved here from St.Louis, amazing.
Painless, extremely helpful, quick.
Stacey, a member of their staff is one of the best staff members of any place I have ever met..I can't even explain how knowledgeable she was and friendly.
I will go back here again and again, they help with things that in St.Louis you would need to go to several places to service your needs for small things all at one place, they do it all.
Highly recommend this place!!!!!!!!!!!!!
