I recently attended the SHOT show in Las Vegas last week and needed to find a local videographer to shoot a series of videos for my company at the Show.
After looking at multiple candidates we decided to use Leo for a day of shooting and the video editing.
Leo was prompt, professional, and a true expert in his field.
He was able to create 15 videos for us and get them out the same week to meet our deadlines.
We will definitely be using him again at our next show.

Leo was recommended to me by a photographer friend for a video I needed fairly quickly.
He was professional, competent and knowledgeable.
The end result far exceeded my expectations.
Can't wait to work with him again.

I hired out Urbane wedding company to video my wedding.
Luckily they sent me Leo to do the job.
Leo was polite and listen to what I had in mind and got the job done with higher expectations then I could have imagined!
He was extremely professional!
We exchanged info at the end of the night and we both went on our way.
Leo keeps all his footage and backs it up just in case.
Something that every bride needs!
Knowing that at anytime I can't find our wedding video or lose it, I know I can give him a call to send it out.
I recommend Leo with more then five stars!
He is truly a gem in the wedding industry!
Thank you Leo!
