This just opened and I had never been into a Hi-Health, so I was amazed at all the Nurtrition/Supplements that are available!
The staff was great at answering all my questions  - 5/5 stars!
I was also very impressed with how knowledeable the staff was - and patient with me in my quest to find a healthy way to loose weight --- just a few pounds, I promise!
Great idea putting this right next to our local grocery store area.
Will make it very convenient to use in the future!

amazing service, i asked some questions and was explained the plus and minus of the different options, I will go back anytime i need a boost
