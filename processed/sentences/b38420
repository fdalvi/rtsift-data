Since its the only thing of its kind in the madison area Im giving it a 3.
There is a lot of equipment for kids to play on.
However most of it is ripped in places and coming apart and the toys dont seem like they are cleaned very often.
There is no changing table in the mens room which is super annoying for a kids place.
My husband uses the ladies room when he takes our boys because of that.
The hours are kinda strange as well.
I am glad for the place but I wish it want in such a terrible location and was better maintained.

Can't beat the price for an afternoon or morning of play for the kids!
The new snack bar is great and I like that there are rooms for the smaller kids to play away from the more rambunctious older kids.
I wish it was closer but we'll worth the drive to let my girl run and play till she nearly falls asleep on her feet!
