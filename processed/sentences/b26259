Very friendly and helpful staff.
It's close to home and they have what I need.

Not sure why I checked in but they didn't have the Atkins Shakes I want.
Fail.
The store looks decent though.

I've been packing some weight since I've started yelping, so why not.
I also had Groupon coupon to use.
Customer service as always is always excellent here and at all GNCs I've been to.
Knowledgeable and friendly service.
I forget the girls name who helped me but she shared a story of her losing 100+ lbs and have kept it off, good job.
There wasn't anyone else there so I started to ask everything and she didn't seem to mind lol.

The staff is so helpful and friendly

This is where I buy my vitamins.
My stomach can be sensitive, but their vitamins never bothered my tummy.
My husband occasionally buys some energy drinks or post work out recovery drinks.
I have the GNC Gold card which gets you a discount, I think it's worth the cost for savings.
The employees are always helpful and friendly.
The store is well organized, clean, and usually well stocked.
