I visited Simple Healings yesterday for the first time and had an absolutely great experience.
The staff was very friendly, the treatments were affordable, and the facilities were just beautiful.
I definitely recommend that you check this place out.

I found a Groupon for this place and decided to try it out.
The place is beautiful.
It is a husband and wife team.
They are very friendly and put you at ease.
I had a 90 minute massage.
It was one of the best massages I have ever had.
I would recommend them to anyone.

I booked 90 minute massage with aromatherapy, I can tell you I feel like a whole new person now!
I feel AMAZING.
He worked my muscles and massaged my whole body into relaxation.
I feel like a whole new person, I will not go anywhere else.
Gorgeous interior and very calming.
I would recommend Simple Healings to anybody who is looking for a fabulous massage in a professional & relaxing atmosphere.
So satisfied, from the booking of appointment to walking out feeling like a new person.

My first massage experience and it was defiantly worth it!
Bought the voucher off of groupon and Bob did a great job!
I will defiantly be back.
