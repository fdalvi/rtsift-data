Wow, can't believe no one has reviewed this  "Small, High end, well managed, well staffed, get the best bike" shop in town.
This place is not your "Discount" type Bike shop - these guys are Pros'.
They know what they are doing, they know how to fit you for a bike, and they know the business.
They Ride, they Tri, they know their stuff.
From Tri bikes, to Mtn.
bikes, to cruiser bike, to accessories - If you are serious or even casual about riding or just want to get the best service - this is the place.
If you are looking for a cheap bike and no care service, then don't go here -There are plenty of other factory type shops that can help you get the wrong deal.
Really - they will help you find what you are looking for - again, great service.

If you haven't sat on a squishy ass cushion to gauge your hips for a saddle, you haven't lived.
Or you just haven't been to Bicycle Haus.
Known as the cool place with all the hot cruisers and Schwinns next to the more hung over and yoga-practiced than thou brunch crowd at Mandala's Tea Room in Old Town Scottsdale, you will find guys who aren't interested in being salesman, being fake or dicks-you will find bike enthusiast who are serious about high performance.
I came in here one day since I had a long ride back to Tempe and my hands were ripped up from sweat on my handlebars, and I forgot my gloves.
I kind of circled around inside, tentatively picked out a pair and the friendliest guy said "did you check out the bargain bin?
" He then proceeded to sit on the floor with me and dump out the bargain basket and had me try on tons of gloves.
I have Charlie Brown hands with freaky short childlike fingers and long palms so most gloves have the unappealing missing finger tip extra material on em.
We ended up with a pair that wasn't in the bin, but not for lack of trying.
They organize rides and all my bike nerd friends (aka Bike Savior founders and mechanics, T.B.A.G.
enthusiasts and other assorted 2 wheeled non motored road warriors) salivate over peeking at this place.
Will you find a cheap bike?
No.
This is the highest plane of bicycle world...this is the HAUS, so serious it is in the German spelling.
I only docked one star since I haven't experienced the full service of buying a big purchase from them, so can't vouch for that but would assume you would def.
be taken care of.
Oh, and I love their counter...so Miami!

Oh I am SO disappointed!
Over the last week in June I scoped out four area bike shops in search of my very first bicycle.
During that time I went to Bicycle Haus where I spoke with Shasta, the owner about what I was looking for in a bike and what my budget was.
She was great and immediately pointed me in the direction of the Specialized Carmel I, giving me loads of reasons it would be the perfect bike for me.
When I saw the price tag I relayed my budget concerns and she said "You know, we can make it work for you," and then helpfully talked me through all the accessories that I would need to have a safe, pleasant ride.
I told her my time frame to buy was about three weeks later, thanked her very much and went on my way.
After visiting the other 3 shops I still liked my experience with BH the best and was also pleased with it's proximity to my house which would make getting there for tune ups and future supply needs extremely easy.
Fast forward selector: I walk in on a Tuesday, just to talk to someone about renting the bike before I bought it, and was pointed to John (Shasta wasn't there) and we talked briefly about the model, purchasing and renting.
I was a little put off by him because even though there were three other guys working there, he would leave me to go answer the phone and ring up other customers.
Come on dude, let's focus on customer service here.
I decided to go back a few days later to speak with Shasta again directly.
When I went in two days later, Shasta was there but didn't remember me, nor attended to me.
I found John who also had a hard time remembering who I was FROM TWO DAYS AGO and we went over all the things I would need again and I told him flat out that Shasta had told me we could make my budget work with this specific bike.
He stood there looking at me blankly, pointed to the price tag and said, "well I don't know what she told you but the price is $450.
" Then I asked him if he would put together an invoice so I could see exactly how much all of this was going to cost me.
More blank staring, then he told me he didn't know how so he left me at the counter just waiting for someone else to help me.
Shasta attended to a few other people who were milling around and then said she could do the proposal for me.
Still no recognition.
After we went through everything the price was almost $200 more than I could spend!
I walked out extremely frustrated.
I'm sure you could explain away not remembering me, but I work in a similar small, specialized industry and even if I don't remember names I always remember faces and frankly in this economy I don't believe that Bicycle Haus has a ton of people coming in looking to purchase their first bike right now.
I find both John and Shasta's behavior very off-putting and very disappointing.
I am all for supporting small businesses and ESPECIALLY women-owned businesses but there's no way I would ever recommend Bicycle Haus to a novice rider/shopper based on my very Jekyl and Hyde experiences.

Bicycle Ha√ºs by far has the coolest new cycling products under one roof.
They have the widest variety of everything you see in the magazines.
I find it impressive that they carry all the newer clothes, hippest bags, lightest wheels and largest food selection you could imagine.
I find myself stopping by for a coffee and checking out what's new weekly.
Checkout the fit studio nextdoor with the vintage track & mtb bikes.

This shop carries bikes at all price points but caters to the high end cycling market.
Very friendly staff, nice to see a business give back so much to the cycling community.
Ask about the vintage track bikes on display in the fit studio!

Bicycle Haus is the best shop in the Valley, if not State.
It's as simple as that.
There isn't another shop that carries the selection (and if you don't see what you are looking for, ask), has the friendly, and actually knowledgeable staff, and reputation that Haus does.
This place has a selection like I've never seen before, especially if you are looking for high end product.
The inventory and shop is always rotating and fresh, so I like to stop in and see what's new almost weekly, plus the staff is really friendly, and always willing to talk bikes.
They have a great selection of apparel, accessories, and nutrition, in brands that you can't find anywhere else around.
If you have never been fit on a bike before, this is the place to do it.
It is literally a computer science, the two hour long (give or take) session, will customize your machine to you!
Taking into account your body, flexibility, physical limitation, goals, and what type of riding you are doing to put you into the most comfortable, efficient, and effective position possible!
The shop also does a lot to support the cycling community both in Charity and time and effort.
Bottom line, if you are looking for good quality and service, this is the place.

Dialed-in.
That's the best way to describe Bicycle Haus in terms of inventory and service.
Always on the bleeding edge of the industry, but not so far away that us "normal" cyclists are left behind.
I know they offer the best of the best in terms of bikes, components, gear, etc, but some of us just aren't looking for that.
They've helped me with a ton of very basic upkeep items and a couple low end bikes (one 26" dirt jump mountain bike and a little kid's push-bike).
I even took my VERY simple single speed road bike in for a custom fit, which was worth EVERY penny.
The crew there has always been more than helpful with hosting community cycling events by helping promote and donating items to be giving away as prizes/awards.
No matter what level or dicipline of bike or biking you're into, Bike Haus will have you covered.

A few months ago, I had a pleasant meeting with the sales manager at a local Einstein's.
Being that I had just moved from San Diego, and had started riding again, I was looking for a new bike shop.
Surely there are none as GREAT as Adam's Ave. in San Diego, and so far, I continue to believe this.
I went in to investigate the store, and upon cursory glance noticed a $30 Specialized bike pump being sold for $70.
Hmmmm.
Interesting.
I went out for a ride last week, and, in my youthful exuberance, forgot my water bottles.
I know!
WHO DOES THAT!?
Along the route was Bicycle Haus.
I had a few meager dollars in my kit, and was in need.
Surely they would help a fellow cyclist out.
I entered, and I did so, feeling like I was getting stabbed by eyeballs.
A better term: eye fucked.
"Who is this enemy intruder, sporting different colors, and wearing a foreign kit?
"  "Details.
", I thought as I stated my case for two water bottles.
After being sized up, the guy behind the counter pointed nonchalantly, and said, "Over there.
"  After grabbing two bottles, I reached into my kit, and told him I was unsure if I had the $12 and change he requested.
I asked if I could bring in the $1.50 or so I may have been short, upon completion of my ride.
He says, "I'm sorry, you're going to need to leave one of the bottles behind if you can't pay for both.
" OVER A DOLLAR AND FIFTY CENTS?!
Turns out, I had $13 in cold hard American currency to pay the man.
But it left a really bad taste in my mouth.
I live on the road that the BH crowd frequents on their way to get their LGO caffeine fix.
I find them to be a generally unfriendly, pompous, and arrogant  lot.
No wave, no smile and nod, no common cycling courtesies.
When seen at LGO, they do the same.
I was passing this story along to a guy that I ride with, and he said that they do group rides on Monday and Wednesdays.
My days might be off, so forgive me.
His personal experiences ring like mine, however he passed one on that left me convinced of the depth of douchebaggery owned by these guys.
Picture if you will: Group ride winding down.
They get to their destination, and one rider develops a slow leak, which by the conclusion of post-ride hanging out has gone flat.
He goes to his trusty steed, and finds a hoof gone wrong.
Upon asking fellow riders for assistance (tube and Co2), they shrug shoulders and leave.
Trusty steed and rider hobbled, he is forced to walk home 1.5 miles, with hobbled steed in tow.
Inappropriate.
Grossly, and wildly inappropriate.
Get it together, guys.
Most definitely NOT what the owner had in mind for his store.
***UPDATE***: While at breakfast this morning, I had the honor of being enlightened with a story from a friend about the Bicycle Haus.
We were talking about my posting, and she said that she had been asked TO NOT COME BACK to BH because she "does not buy enough stuff" at BH.
She is a mountain biker, and was coming in regularly to get service done on her mountain bike.
Along with her service stop, she would pick up some post ride bars, and whatnots, and drop her bike, and go.
Seems as though they did not take kindly to her "quickies" and asked her to stop coming in, all together.
And now one of the service guys calls to ask her come to come back in??
Seriously?
And so, I was left thinking to myself, "That figures.
" when I heard of these shenanigans.
They can have em, cuz we don't want em!
But, hey, if the "coolest, sexiest, hippest" poser shit, some nose high attitude self-absorbed, pompous people, and bad service are what you're after, than it sounds like this is YOUR place!
BUT...
If you're an established, legitimate cyclist, and you look for inconsequential things like good service, competent wrenches, good vibes, good peeps, a smile, an appreciative owner who is thankful for your patronage, and and fun group of people who frequent the shop than you just might want to search elsewhere.
I would suggest Adam's Avenue, but maybe I'm the only one willing to pack all of my bikes and drive them to San Diego.
***Update #2*** I have never received "hate mail" for a post, until I did from a dude named Robert who said that I was a "douchebag, wanna-be asshole" for writing the review I wrote on BH.
Who would think I could irk someone SO MUCH just by expressing my opinion?
Love you, Robert.
;)  It would be of no loss if this place did not survive the economy.
And so, now it just complicated because: Of course, this is just OUR opinion, WE could be wrong.

Just popped into Bicycle Haus this past week looking for new components for my ride.
I was looking at a custom order  (~$1500 worth).
Guy behind the counter was busily typing away and thanked me and said he'd call me.
I walked around the corner and glanced over my shoulder.
Turns out the guy was on Facebook the whole time....very disappointing.

If you are looking for a shop with exceptional attention to detail... look no further.
I've been riding and racing with these guys for over 15 years and they are as knowledgeable  a group of cycling enthusiasts that you will find.
I highly recommend their store.

I think they're going out of business!
Stopped by twice this week, middle of the day - closed up tight,  no lights, no bikes outside, no explanation.

This was a great experience, and it's funny how it happened.
A friend of mine bought some things there like a seat bag with a repair kit, multi tool, etc.
and then returned it the next day after deciding not to purchase a road bike as he had intended to.
He reported some attitude from them, and then later that week I'd heard some other stories.
So, I wanted to go in and look at their bikes as I was in the market for a new road cycle, and judge for myself what the service was like.
I found Mark to be very helpful on my first visit even after telling him I wasn't purchasing a bike any time soon.
When I did decide I wanted to buy a bike, I went in and rode just about every Ultegra bike in the shop.
Before and after each test ride, they cleaned off the whole bike, put my pedals on, provided feedback and dialed in the seat and everything for me.
Other shops, even "high end" shops, will just guesstimate the setup of the bike, and often are reluctant to put on your own pedals and instead just want to use test ride platforms.
I left a deposit on the BMC I chose, that was equal to about 7% just because it was all I had at the time.
They were cool with that, and then excercised patience while I was rounding up the money to pay it off.
When I finally came in to pick up the bike, they had everything set up for me and even fitted the bike for me and gave me some free swag.
The biggest thing is the owner, Kale, said "thank you for giving us your business.
" I know it seems trivial, but most places will just say thanks, and it is kind of empty.
He made it seem sincere, like I was really important, and they really appreciated me spending my hard earned cash there.
I also exchanged a couple of emails and asked a couple of questions to Brock and Russ, who both were prompt, informative, and friendly.
If you have a question about your body mechanics on a bike or how it should be set up, Craig is a guru.
He even forgot he took out my insole and forgot to put it back in, and then called me and acted as though he was ready to bring it to me.
I must say, the stories I heard about the poor service are bunk.
My friends must all be doing the same drug, or they get nervous when they walk into a shop with this much worth of inventory.
This shop is clean as a whistle, well stocked, organized, and the staff is extremely knowlegable and friendly.
I wouldn't feel comfortable bringing a Huffy in here for service, but for anyone who is a semi-serious to a racing cyclist, this is a dream shop.

I must say that I am extremely happy that I ignored the 1-2 stars reviews of Bicycle Haus here on Yelp when I was shopping around to pick up a new ride.
My experiences with the store were nothing short of being top rate.
It clearly makes me question the integrity of the individuals that wrote those previous reviews.
Russ, Shawn and Broc were not only extremely knowledgeable and helpful, but they went out of their way to make my experience with their store that much better.
On my first stop into Bicycle Haus late on a Sunday afternoon, Broc and Shawn both spend an exorbitant amount of time with me walking through their bikes and prices discussing all of their pros and cons and helping me dial into a few bikes to come back in to test ride based on my preferences and past experiences.
They are a top of the line bike shop, but they were not pretentious in talking down about other brands not carried in their store like other have discussed.
Even though the bike store was closing, they stayed open and continued to help me out.
I came back on the next Friday, and Russ was extraordinarily helpful test riding each of the bikes.
Russ set up the bikes with my own pedals and provided me initial fits to each of them.
They best part was when the store told me to take each of the bikes out for a 5-6 mile ride to get a feel of how they rode on aggressive climbs, windy descents and nice flats.
Most shops would not have allowed me to take bikes of this level out of the parking lot let alone on a 5-6 mile loop.
Russ even made sure the bikes were tuned up properly to make the experiences were what they were meant to be like.
At this point I explored about 8-10 different LBS in between the Phoenix Metro area and Tucson/Oro Valley.
I ended picking up one of their 2011 Specialized Tarmac Pros SL3 with a modified Dura Ace configuration that Friday.
Even though I was convinced this was the bike I wanted, Russ and Shawn offered me to take one of the Ultegra Tarmac Elite builds home for a couple days to test ride it and convince myself even more.
I thanked them for the offer, but I still ended picking up my bike that day instead.
Russ continued to completely set up the bike to my desired configuration that same afternoon without any extra charges.
I would normally expect that, but it was a nice touch when he went out of the way to rebuild my pedals for me for free even though I bought a different set to put on the Tarmac.
Thank you for a great experience guys!
You definitely know how to win over a client by giving them good ole' fashioned great customer service like it is suppose to be done.
Most of my LBS experiences were only a fraction of what you guys provided.
I cannot wait until I get the complete fit done.
Cheers!

I was in Scottsdale on Vacation with my family and I had broke a wheel the day before in Moab.
I went to another store in the area and they told me it would be a week before they could look at the wheel.
I called Bicycle Haus after looking on-line based on some other criteria, and spoke with Shasta who was empathetic to my situation.
She called the Mavic Rep who in turn dropped off a set of wheels for me to borrow for the week, which I chose to buy.
I never mentioned my resume or history in the initial phone conversations.
I had been on the National Team, raced pro in Europe and a couple years on the Grundig World Cup.
This was over a decade ago for nearly the same amount of time.
When I was racing I definitely got preferential treatment in nearly any store in the world, and I certainly had my connections when I needed them.
I don't have that luxury anymore.
I now only ride on a very limited basis, and still much of the equipment I have is archaic and dates back to my last year of racing.
Bicycle Haus went out of there way to help me salvage a small bit of riding on my trip to Arizona.
They genuinely seemed to be concerned with my minor hardship and they made me feel at home.
Bicycle Haus did not know anything about my background and essentially didn't make a dime on my transaction.
I think this demonstrates their interest in the good of the cycling community.
I would recommend Bicycle Haus as a great choice for any serious cyclist.
They have a great deal of knowledge, beautiful inventory, and certainly went out of their way in a very altruistic manner.
Thanks Shasta and Thanks Bicycle Haus and I look forward to seeing you next spring.

Funny, the first time that I attain a "Dukedom", it's to a place that I'm not really pleased with.
I attained this status by having to take my bike back several times for the same BASIC repair.
I took my bike in for a tune up primarily because it was not shifting appropriately.
When I dropped it off the entire staff was very busy watching the Tour De France.
They said they might be able to get it to it that day.
Two days later I had to call them asking them if my bike was done.
"Oh yeah we finished it at 4:30 last night.
"   Apparently they finished it closer to closing time than that because who ever "fixed it" didn't bother taking it for a test ride.
Unfortunately I discovered this on a 15 mile desert ride.
it was a rough ride.
The next day when I took it back, I believe it was the manager manning the shop.
He was busy with a customer when i came in.
I have no problem with only 1 person manning the shop on a weekday afternoon, I don't have a problem with the fact that he was busy, but I do have an issue when someone doesn't even bother to acknowledge you.
Customer service rule #1 acknowledge your customer.
Just say hello and tell me that you will be with me as soon as you can.
I waited for about 15 minutes before someone else came into the shop and helped me.
Apparently the person that took the bike from me didn't pass on the fact that this was a return issue.
When I went to pick up the bike again they tried to charge me for the repairs.
Guess what.........IT"S STILL NOT FIXED.

Not being a "bike" person, the thought of venturing into a bicycle specialty shop is a little intimidating to me...however, they couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful, which totally put me at ease.
They have a very informed crew working there, everyone was busy working on bikes or talking with clients, but they didn't hesitate to take the time to answer questions and educate me a bit about the products I was looking to purchase.
My son purchased a "Fixie" and not only is it slick, its a piece of art really (and this coming from someone who doesn't really dig bikes!
), but the price was more than fair.
Not sure whats going on with some of the haters reviews on here, my experience was delightful and I would definitely recommend Bicycle Haus to novices who are looking to buy a fabulous product but need a little guidance.

For years I've been wanting a road bike and being the Internet nerd I spent most of my time online doing research.
As with car shopping decided to then hit some local bike shops to test some out and get some help.
Unfortunately I did not find a shop that worked out for me until my close friend introduced me to Bicycle Haus in downtown Scottsdale.
These guys are the real deal and Brock took great care of me.
Got me set up with an awesome Specialized Tarmac bike and all the essential gear and tips to get me on the road.
I had a zillion questions and the team was really patient with me.
Had an issue with my right clip not working well and brought it back to Bicycle Haus and they took care of fixing it while I waited.
If you looking for expertise and highest quality bike and or gear definitely check out Bicycle Haus.

I used to be very fond of this shop, but the differences in attitudes displayed towards high and low dollar customers makes me re-think my original rating.
I had some very poor experiences and follow up with their fit service, which for what it costs should not have happened.
I also had a warranty issue with an expensive frame that I ended up having to deal with independently.
I originally recommended the shop to two people and later had some very unfortunate reports back on their experiences, which was a bit of a bummer.
I like the staff members personally, but I can't recommend it to others anymore.
People also need to keep in mind that many of these positive reviews were written by people who race for their old team, or who have been a few of the long-time customers

Not exactly talkative bunch in there.
I have been in the shop three times in the last six months and it has been an effort to get them to talk or smile.
I get the impression that they want to be left alone.
This shop is a MAVIC wheel dealer, so in May I took my front R-SYS there to be trued.
(It got tweaked riding in the back of an SUV).
I asked at the counter if anybody there was trained on truing R-SYS wheels.
The man at the cash register said he was and took my wheel to the truing stand.
To my surprise he did not pop out the lock ring and was done in about 5 minutes.
I paid $10 for the work, took my wheel home and put it on my bike thinking all was good.
To my surprise it was still about 1.5mm out of true and he had it about 2mm out of round.
Now armed with the knowledge that the shop mechanic is a BS master and will not tell the customer the truth I mailed my wheel to the Colorado area MAVIC wheel rep.
He fixed it at no charge and it is round and true.
My take on this shop is, if you want this to be your local bike shop and purchase a new bike and a Ralpha kit the crew will take very good care of you.
As long as you don't have them true an R-SYS wheel.

Wow nice looking place from the outside..i was really looking forward to spending my money there!
However I was in the store looking around for at least ten minutes no one asked If I needed assistance or acknowledged I was there at all.
When I did inquire about a bike I got probably the rudest brush off reply, like I was bothering them.
Very cold atmosphere, rude snobby people they work on bicycles for crying out loud, I almost had to laugh!
I will spend twice as much some where else!
They got two stars because they place looks cool.

Kale and the guys down at Bike Haus are at the top of their game.
If you are looking for the most professional high end shop around then look no further.
