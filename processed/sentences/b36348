We don't live in NV, so I was a little nervous to have to order my cake long distance since we wouldn't be able to do any tastings or meet anyone face to face.
I called this bakery and spoke with them on the phone and they were very nice, answered all my questions, and made me feel at ease.
I found a picture online of what I wanted my cake to look like and e-mailed it over to them, and they did a fantastic job.
It looked exactly as I wanted it, the cake was very moist, and the icing tasted great!
They delivered the cake to my reception site, and everything was done as I expected it!

Had a destination wedding in Las Vegas.
Ordered the cake based on the previous yelp review and was just as pleased.
Cake was beautiful and tasty.
Great job.

Amazing cake designs!
Prompt, friendly service and I just about did everything by email from California!!
I sent them a couple of internet photos of ideas that I had for my friend's 40th birthday cake and they just ran with it.
SUPER CUTE RESULT!!
Check out their FB page for just a sampling of the wonderful designs they can do!

We're here for my sister's wedding cake.
Kim is so amazing, her willingness to work with you and her design ideas are impeccable!!!
They make the best designed and best tasting cakes!
Highly highly recommend.
