I nice little sandwich/coffee shop near the river.
I was in Edinburgh on business staying at the Malmaison Hotel about a block away.
The Clock became a regular stop on my way to work every morning.
Friendly Staff Good espresso A small selection of pastries.
But the best was the sausage sandwiches with HP sauce.

Looking out on to Leith Docks, Clock certainly boasts some great views.
The sandwiches here attract all the nearby  industrial and corporate attention.
After tasting a chorizo, Mexican cheese and salsa roll I was unsurprised at the afore mentioned attention.
There's a range of good deli's scattered around Edinburgh, and Clock can be proud to be one of them.
The staff are talkative and inviting too.
Top stuff.

Considering the number of times that I visit The Clock, I don't rate it that highly... am I mad?
Totally, but that doesn't take away from the fact that I can a) park around the corner quite easily and b) always get a quick lunch here that satisfies my basic hunger  The staff are nice & friendly, but the soup is often flavour-less and the baked potatoes are really hit or miss - quite often I've gotten home to find that my tattie is uncooked in the middle.
(I'm an old-fashioned, proper oven-baked to within a "skin" of it's life-potato gal).
The wrap & sandwich selection look much better, but I'm not big on bread... perhaps that's where I'm going wrong?!
I would still recommend for a quick grab & run lunch in Leith... and the service has pushed up a 2star to a 3star...
I'm nice like that!

Although a trifle underwhelming, you're not going to go too far wrong at The Clock.
Dishes are to a good standard, and the welcome is friendly.
Reliable, if unspectacular.
Overall, we said: "The Clock is really pretty smart, continues to be very popular, and is a good lunchtime stop.
Its offerings didn't unduly quicken my pulse, but they provided good wholesome fare, and, with the warmth of the welcome, set me on my way with a smile upon my face.
