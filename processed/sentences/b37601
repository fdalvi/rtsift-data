Great park of the beaten path for kids.
Also has a solash pad in the summer time.
Great park all around.

Love this park!
It feels very private.
(Except for the school next door) the only time the school becomes a problem is when it's over and all the parents crowd the parking lot of the park and take all the spaces.
There really should be some sort of rule against that because it's hard to get in or out when the parents are parked in all the spots and in a line blocking the parking lot!
That's the reason for my four stars, otherwise this park is pretty ideal for young children.
We fly kites, blow bubbles, play in the sand, and it even has a splash pad that's separate from everything else.
It's somewhat small, but it has everything you need.
The restrooms are pretty decent for park facilities and if you come in the earlier afternoon there always seems to be maintenance on site so it maintains it's upkeep.

Anthems great little secret.
We spash padded.... We've been twice in a week and it's never crowded!
The ants are bad but bearable.
I am loving every park we've seen in this area so far, and can't wait to try them out when the weather cools off.
