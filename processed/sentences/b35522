This company was great!
They provided me a security system at no cost and a discounted monitoring rate.
Also, they sent over a former police officer to do the consultation and he gave us a bunch of crime prevention tips on how to make our house safe.
We had a big nationwide company before these guys and they were able to not only give us all new equipment but also lowered my monthly rate and did all of this at no cost.
Extremely happy!
Thank you!!

Thoroughly pleased with our AZ Alarm Company alarm system that we've had since April.
I really appreciate the mobile apps that allow us to monitor our alarm activity as well as disarm and arm the system.
Jim, the consultant who came to the house was very professional and extremely helpful.
Recently I was 2,000 miles away and still was able to allow access to our neighbors so that they could feed our dogs.
They key fob is a nice feature as well.
Glad we made the switch from out previous company!
We are thankful we found this company.
Thanks AZ Alarm Company

We have used this company to install multiple security systems.
They have always done superior work.
They are knowledgable and professional.
The equipment they install is top notch, user friendly and very affordable compared to other companies in Arizona.
Thank you.
