So I live in the ghetto and this is the Home Depot I go to even though there is one a tad closer to my house.
The staff here is always very friendly and very very helpful!
On my recent trip Denny in the hardware section was beyond helpful, I wouldnt have been able to complete my project without his help!
The Hubs and I also purchased carpeting from here for our bedrooms.
They look great and were installed quickly!

I guess it's an okay place.
Out of the many times I've been here, I only get greeted or even helped a handful of times.
Countless employees walk by and no one really says anything or even looks at you for that matter.
You kind of have to find them if you need help.
Aside from that, store is actually pretty clean.

Not a whole lot to be said for this Home Depot.
It's about the only game in the area and they seem to know it.
In the trips I've made here, I've only been in and out when I didn't need to interact with the staff -- and, even then, I've been delayed 10+ minutes bc their spray paint cans didn't have the HD UPC stickers, resulting in three employees getting involved.
You're probably going here but, you know, just have an idea of what you are in for.

I hate it when I call a store and can't get a live person on the line or anyone to pick up the phone once I've been transferred--which was the case with the plumbing department at this location.
You suck.

Home Depot got everything you need to fix or remodel your house or anything in that matter.
The place is huge and can use more employees to assist customers.
Waited awhile to get my key copy but nobody came to assist me.
But it's alright I was in a hurry.
