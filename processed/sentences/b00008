This public library is a short drive from our house.
During the school year you see a lot of students here from the neighboring schools.
During the summer a lot of Moms here w/ their toddlers and young preschoolers reading.
I don't go here much although my daughter does.
They're open til 8PM four days a week which is cool for those who work later in the day.
Before we replaced our printer, I was here frequently.
Some of the librarians can be snooty but whatever.
It's a small hometown type library but has what you need to relax and read or get some work done on their computers and printers.
A good-needed staple for the area.
INFO:  Monday-Thursday: 9-8 Friday-Saturday: 9-5:30 Sunday: 12-3  CLOSED: January 1, Easter Sunday, Memorial Day, July 4, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, December 24 & 25.
Closing early at 5:30 on December 31.

The library is a nice, clean facility with good, diverse resources for patrons.
However, there is no designated quiet area that is closed off from the noise/speaking that happens in the front of the library.
There is a quiet reading room, but it is not closed off, so the noise easily travels back there.
Additionally, there are hardly ANY outlets near tables, so if you need to study using a computer, you're quite possibly out of luck.
Overall, I expect a quiet area to study in a library, and this one doesn't necessarily deliver.
More outlets would also make it a better studying spot.

Needs more books and homeless people.
DVD collection didn't include Jingle All The Way and the place feels off putting.
One star.

I've had a copy of Jingle All The Way since it came out and they haven't charged me a late fee yet.
Talk about refusing to enforce the laws.
