I called these people about a door that was damaged.
The hinge was broken.
They gave me the options of how we could repair it.
I went with replacing the entire door and frame since it was only 25 dollars more then repairing the existing one.
What I was really happy with is I didn't even need to paint after it was done.
No damge to the surronding walls or paint.
I would definately recommend these guys.

Have been looking for a good handyman for sometime and unfortunately, I'll have to keep looking.
We needed three new sinks installed and Mr.
Fix it was not happy that there were other trades working in the house, mad that he'd have to get some supplies, and unwilling to work past four.
Besides, he was rude to my girlfriend.
I fired them and am getting someone else.

What a great array of quality, affordable services this company offers!
I have used them for over two years now for inside and outside projects from a shed tear down to repair of my sliding glass door, to a leak in my kitchen sink.
Not only are they quick to respond, quick to compete the job, polite and good at cleaning up after themselves, but it's always at the best price I find anywhere.
I think what I like most about Linda and her team - what makes it really stand out - is that she is just plain helpful and as concerned about my bottom line as her own.
I have called her several times to say 'This is what is happening, what do you think it is?
" and she'll say "It's probably this or that.
Try this and see if it works.
If not, call me back.
" She could just as easily have said, "We'll come over and charge you $x but she didn't and doesn't.
" That's nice!
I own a small business too, and I know that for every 19 nice customers there are bound to be one or two that you can't please no matter how much you stand on your head for them.
And they're often the folks who vent their spleen unreasonably on these review sites.
So I thought it only right to take the time to tell you how great this company is.
I thoroughly recommend Arizona's Mr. Fixit to any metro-Phoenix business or individual.

I have used this company for several years, and will continue to do so.
Their handymen are knowledgeable, polite, and prompt.
Their rates are fair.
They have helped me with an electrical socket, washing machine, and cabinetry.
They take pride in their work.
