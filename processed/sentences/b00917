Just had the worst customer service from the management at the  Chilis on Camelback and 20th st. As a long time former employee of the company, I'm even more appalled!
Sad day :(

Most definitely the dirtiest Chili's I've ever experienced, inside and outside.
The patio had cigarette butts, a dirty ash tray filled with water from the misters, bits of trash strewn about.
Inside tables were left dirty, the bathroom was filthy too.
My food was cold and dried out like it had been made for someone earlier and then left under the warming lights.
Because I was in polite company and we were in a bit of a hurry I didn't sent it back.
I am quite shocked that I didn't get sick after eating there.
Both the health dept and corporate need to make a surprise visit.

Had lunch there today.
Waited for about 5 minutes for the host.
Then walked to the bar area looking for someone to seat us...no bartender.
After all that I was ready to never come back.
But the trip was saved by the service of our server.
I wish I could remember her name!
