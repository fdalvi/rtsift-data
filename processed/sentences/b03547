I wish everybody to experience such a quality time as the one you will experience in this spa  The village is pretty much what I wish to find when I get to paradise  Love it

I love this spa and Rochelle is the absolute best!
I've had several treatments  here and now I only go to Rochelle.
She does an amazing job with brow design, facials, peels etc.
I wouldn't go to any other spa in Scottsdale!

The Village at Gainey Ranch is the best!
Great environment, friendly staff, many amenities.
I get a great workout in here as well as take advantage of the excellent spa.
Snow is my favorite for my manicures and pedicures.
As for my hair cuts, Crissy rocks!
