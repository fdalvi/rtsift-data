Since Foot Surgery, I am finding that most of my yelps are about the places I am actually able to go visit.
(Doctor's offices and such)  Apparently my foot has not been on board with the post op healing, so my doctor referred me to Advanced Manual Therapy.
The Staff is absolutely awesome!
I made an appointment, when I went in I  had to fill out the paperwork, and then I was taken back for an evaluation.
Physical Therapy ... is a little like torture when you are already in pain , but I have to say that they do this all with a smile , and the make you believe that you too are on board for said torture.
(it really isn't as bad as I write, but I tend to be a baby when it comes to the frankenfoot)  Very positive atmosphere- and they help you set attainable goals, as well as get you to forget "trying"  we don't TRY ... we DO or we WILL.
I am totally excited to go back next week and hit my next goal.

Still going through physical therapy here.
I have to say that Jody , Andy, Dave, Jen all make a very excruciating recovery .. one that is fun and they challenge me to work harder .
Completely professional - and compassionate care.
Stephanie the receptionist/office manager rocks!
always very helpful and takes care of all the sticky insurance stuff ...
If you find yourself in need of physical therapy, I guarantee you that this clinic is the best one out there.

I chose Advanced Manual Therapy in hopes that they would speed my return to an active lifestyle after a serious shoulder injury.
I found the Advanced approach to hands-on therapy to be just what I needed.
I was motivated to work harder and gained greater range of motion and strength after only a few sessions.
The soft-tissue massage combined with aggressive stretching made a positive difference in my case.
Highly recommended.
