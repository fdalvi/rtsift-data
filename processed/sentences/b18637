Well of course men would like this place and rate it highly.
I actually had a good conversation w/ the barista.
She was nice and my vanilla latte was pretty good.
However, it's no Ice Blended Vanilla Latte from Coffee Bean.
I guess if I was good enough/met the criteria to work there, I may just work there for an ego boost.
I just don't like the fact that women are constantly objectified and their worth based on their physical "assets" or lack thereof.
Anyone can dress up like that.
I wouldn't expect anything less from Vegas.

Take a drive down Flamingo Road in Las Vegas and you pass by...Mortons, Ruth Chris, Flemings, Roy's Hawaiian...and SEXXPRESSO?!
We hit the brakes, literally, to do a double take.
So in lieu of Starbucks, we head here out of curiosity more than anything.
Sexxpresso boasts "The Hottest Coffee in Vegas" and is a free-standing structure that is drive-thru only.
We drive up to the window and are immediately greeted by a female barista in a sexy referree costume who was comfortable with our surprised, wide-eyed looks.
I ordered a soy cappuccino which was pretty good.
Less sweet than Starbucks.
Their menu has good a variety of smoothies, coffee drinks, and blended ices.
They aren't open on Sundays.
Probably because the female baristas were out dancing the night before at their "other" jobs.
Only in Vegas would this place work.
Worth a pit stop just for kicks!

It's hard to find a non corporate coffee outlet in Las Vegas, but I found this place on Flamingo .
Good coffee , not just a conversation piece.
I ordered the Mocha, much better that I would have expected from a drive in.
No pastries offered here, but a good choice of hot and frozen coffees.
