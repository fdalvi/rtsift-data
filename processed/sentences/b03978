We love Dr. Curran and the entire East Valley Children's Center team!
Dr. Curran is thorough, caring, attentive and energetic.
My husband and I are constantly pleased by his attention to detail and care for our son.
The office staff is also very kind and efficient and we are never left waiting.
EVCC also has a superb website that answers all the questions that new parents will have.
It's even more comforting to know that the info was written and compiled by the Doctors.

been taking our children for 17 years to see Dr. Curran.
Even when we lived in Johnson Ranch (that was a long drive).
He has aways talked to the children on their level before talking to parents.
On rare cases when we can not see him the other doctors at EVCC fill in for him.
That also focus on the kids.
I have no problem see any of the other doctors.
