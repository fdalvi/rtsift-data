Although some of the patrons can be a little tactless, (such as an old man standing up and yelling things to people at random)  this place is really nice to come to early in the morning.. Its not too crowded and the service is very prompt and sufficient...
However, there were not many veg options (I would have been more than happy to give 5 stars, had there been)..
I did find the fruit bowl to be delightful..
The hash-browns were very good too!!
I will most likely be returning..
Thanks for the great service!

Much like any other IHop.
The waitress was nice with the kids.

The food is usually good, especially pancakes and omelets.
It's usually busy, the booths are not that comfortable, but the service is friendly and it's a cozy place.
I come here about once a month.

I'm not the biggest IHOP fan but each week after our weekly meeting someone picks a restaurant and this week they wanted IHOP.
There was 10 of us in our party for dinner.
Our servers name was Denise got everyone's drink orders and took our dinner orders.
Denise seemed to disappear for long periods of time instead of being attentive to our beverage refills.
All  in all I guess her service was OK.
If the place was busy I would be more forgiving but it wasn't.
All in all Denise was very sweet and friendly.
On a good note I ordered the Tilapia Florentine ( two delicately seasoned tilapia filets, resting on a bed of spinach tossed in creamy Alfredo sauce and served with creamy mashed potatoes) I asked for a vegetable instead of the mashed potatoes).
When my dish arrived I did not see the menu said my Tilapia came in a  Alfredo sauce.
I asked what the sauce was and Denise told me ad asked "Why didn't I want the Alfredo sauce  " I replied I didn't see it was in a sauce", She asked if I'd like it without the sauce and brought me a new Tilapia dish with no problems or attitude.
What can I say?
It's IHOP.
Need I say more?
Everyone else in my group enjoyed their meals.
Sometimes you are in the mood for IHOP like food we were.
Our expectations were met and IHOP didn't disappoint us.
FOOD: I don't expect much from these types of restaurants so it's a hard to let me down when I eat there.
The food is OK nothing special but It hit the spot.
SERVICE: We liked the service that was given to us.
The restaurant accommodated our party of  10 no problem.
Our waitress was friendly, attentive and efficient.
CONCLUSION: The food was  good, typical IHOP food.
No complaints on that at all.
You get exactly what you expect.
IHOP is IHOP, Its laid back, casual dining.
The experience is better when you're with friends.
The menu is the same everywhere.

DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT

Normally when I come here the service is ok.
This time I received the worst service.
The restaurant was not too busy but our server was very inattentive.
After waiting for ten minutes we had to ask someone to get our server.
Once our food came we had to hunt someone down to bring us jelly for our bread.
We were never asked during the meal if we needed anything.
Then when my drink ran out, not only did I ask our server for water we asked someone else and never received it.
Not a very good experience at all.

Would be a better if the new servers would pay more attention to their tables.
I sat at my table for 15 before we were offered to order drinks.
The food was served fast and was good as always but was not impressed with the service.
Had to ask twice for silverware and the sides we had ordered.
