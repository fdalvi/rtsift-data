Super amazing car wash!!
This is the absolute best no touch car wash I have ever been in.
No need to scrub your car prior, it literally got everything off and I was through some weather, not to mention a cross country road trip full of bugs.
The people are all so nice!
They look happy to be at work.
There is a wide variety of goodies to choose from.
Parking is so amazing, there is such a large lot, the gas pumps are easily accessible as well as the the location in general.
Be sure to stop in.
This Ms. Terribles is fantastic and nothing compared to the Terribles "Chevron" that is just a mile or two away.

It's clean and new.
Chevron is the only gas station that I know of that sells Real Water.

I'm so glad they finally opened this location.
It's really convenient b/c the chevron in the smiths shopping center gets crazy.
The car wash is pretty nifty too b/c they it's all water powered.
The gas station attendants are really polite too.
Yay!
