I love Elizabeth's Moments of Joy!!
I would give this business 6 stars if I could!
I contacted Elizabeth and ordered a collection of cookies and whoopie pies for my graduation party.
I was definitely not disappointed in the quality and everyone loved them!
Way better than Sprinkles (gross!).
Her whoopie pies (basically a cupcake sandwich) are the most amazing things!
The flavor is indescribable!
I would say my ultimate favorite is her smore whoopie pie, seriously tastes just like a smore.
Amazing!
Her cookies are fabulous and the scones are a happy twist on a classic scone (not dry at all).
I would say my fave cookie so far is the Sweet & Salty Butterscotch, although I can honestly say I have not had a bad cookie from her.
Long story kind of short... if you are looking for amazing tasting baked goods that you don't have to slave over yourself, then look no further.
I will definitely be adding this to my list of gift ideas from now on!

Absolutely delicious twisted scones!
My taste buds cheered when I ate the Death NY Cinnamon scones!!

I usually find the baked goods at the Gilbert farmer's market.
I thought they only made cookies but today I discovered the gluten free lemon raspberry whoopee pie.
I did my best to make last through the day, but I could not resist.
It was amazing!!
Enough for me to look this site up and find the location so I could buy another!
