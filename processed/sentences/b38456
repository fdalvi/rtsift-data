Paid $75 for my little girls iPhone 4S to get unlocked back in March.
Aside from the lack of AC and the strong stench of lingering smoke, waiting 10 mins for it to be unlocked was no biggie.
We were told not to touch the SIM card.
Went back in August after updating the phone, nothing would work off of Wifi.
They unlocked it once again and told us not to update the phone.
I assume I'll be back once another update becomes available.

I called to get a quote on a repair for screen replacement, and I was told $ 120, so I drove 45 minutes to get over to Phones Are Us.
I get there and after I say $120 correct ?
Then I'm told "oh no that's just for the part, and it's like $200", then from $200 it went to $180, then the clerk said "oh wait let me ask my boss", while the clerk and boss went back and forth as to what to charge me they settled on $180, after they tossed around $160,$170, $175.
This place is a joke.
Go elsewhere.

DON'T HAVE THIS COMPANY REPLACE YOUR BATTERY IN YOUR IPHONE!!!!
I recently asked them to do it and it took 3 hours for something I confirmed takes a few minutes.
Furthermore, they charged me $60 to install it when the battery costs just $35.
After leaving their shop, I plugged the phone in to charge and it went as far as 13%.
I called the shop and all they said was to bring it back - no way!
I went to another shop and they confirmed that Installation of an iPhone battery requires that the connector needs to be soldered to the motherboard, and mine was never soldered.
Phones Are Us are a bunch of hacks and scam artists.
