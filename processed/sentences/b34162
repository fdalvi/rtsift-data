If you are looking to get rid of scrap metal from your home or business, or are looking for a local recycling facility check these guys out.

awesome service and great prices.
Finally a scrap metal/recycling company who are service orientated and have awesome pricing.
Thanks guys

I chose to bring my steel here for two reasons.
Reason 1: When I called, the employee was very knowledgeable and informative.
He patiently answered my questions and was very friendly, unlike some other metal recyclers I called.
Reason 2: I Buy Scrap offered the best price (well they tied another) of the four places I called.
The visit: I pulled in, walked up to the cashier window and he told me what to do.
Again, this employee was professional and courteous.
After weighing in, I was told where to unload the scrap, I weighed in again, collected my cash and receipt and I left.
Easy.
He even told me how much metal I dumped and how much my vehicle weighed (I was curious!).
I went somewhere else a while ago and they expected me to know where to go and what to do and an employee walked off with some of my aluminum with no explanation and I never got a receipt.
I felt ripped off (maybe I was, maybe not).
Not here though.
I Buy Scrap was great and I will be back.

I just wanted to said that, I am somone that like to scrap, been at so many locations and never, ever had this "great " experience I had from this company they're very people oriented, professional, this guys have the greates customers service I've ever seen on scrap business.
Not only that, the people at they're cashier window are really friendly as well!!!
There has not been a time that I leave that place with a big smile on my face .....
I strongly recommend this scrap yard and I well always come back!!
