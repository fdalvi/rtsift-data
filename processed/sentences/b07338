i bring random things here *cough* Guns *cough* when i need some quick weekend cash.
nice people, sometimes they seem standoffish, but are actually really nice.
my buddy Manuel works here.
the funny story is we discovered allot in common after i pawned my ipod.
haha.
then we ran into each other at the brickhouse during a hip-hop show...i forget which one.
oh well.
cool ass mofo.
this place always get two thumbs up from me, and i tell people if they need a pawn, go to windy city.
Yelp!

I traded in a set of drums here and was able to get a great deal on a guitar.
The employee who helped me was very knowledgeable and honest.
He genuinely cared for the purchase I wanted to make.
He gave me a great deal, and showed me keys components in the item I bought.
I would highly recommend doing business with this company.
It's a small looking place on the outside, but  when you get inside, they have a good selection or multiple things.
Very honest business!

I stopped here thinking it was Mo money pawn (which I was not impressed with once I found).
Really nice collection of things.
Musical instruments, tools, guns.
They had these two crazy looking knives from Brazil with intricate claywork and real monkey skulls on the hilt.
The guy at the counter was very friendly and seemed genuine.
The place had a nice vibe.
We were looking for ammo, but like every other store in the city right now they were out.
I will definitely be back.

This place is GREAT!
Got rid of some jewelry I never wear and they got me the beat price for it.
Plus they had a variety of items for sale.
The staff was friendly and you can tell that the manager, Johnny, definitely takes pride in his staff and store.
Wonderful experience!
