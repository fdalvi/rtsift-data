Chris is a God-send!
Literally!
I found him in the church bulletin and went there in need of major auto repairs.
My 2002 Chevy Trailblazer has a lot of miles on it and all the original parts are starting to fall apart.
He does free diagnostics and doesn't charge a huge labor cost.
He doesn't make up problems with your car just to get the business.
And if you bring in the parts, he discounts the labor cost.
Very fair.
Very nice man and his staff is super cool as well.
I highly recommend him.
I have been super happy with his service.

Such a great shop!
They never let me down with their attention to details and professional customer service.
The owner is a great guy and very friendly.. Definitely recommended.

Today my wife and I took our Sonata down to Chris's Auto Repair based on a recommendation from a co-worker.
I'm always apprehensive about repair shops because you never know if you can trust them or not.
Well, I'm not going to have any more fears because he's getting all my business from now on.
In a nutshell, this guy is honest, does excellent work, and charges very reasonable prices.
There is no reason to go anywhere else.
Its very refreshing to find a place like this here in Las Vegas.

The best and honest auto shop in town!
Chris has worked on my Lexus, Ford, and Cadallic.
His staff  was friendly and on top of there work.
It's hard to find a reasonable honest shop in town I am so greatful to have Chris and his staff to work on my vehicles, they have been able to fix any issue I have had.
