Stephanie at AZ Hair Company is amazing!
My color is gorgeous and my cut is just perfect.
My hair has never looked this good or felt this great.
I'll never go to another stylist again.

Had my hair done here today they did a great job!!

My sister is too nice to post a review, so I am posting on her behalf.
She went into AZ Hair Co with the expectation to walk out as a light brunette or a dirty blonde, as she was told would happen by the AZ Hair Co stylist.
She is in the process of going back blonde.
Instead, she walked out in full blown tears and with yellow hair.
The personnel told her there was nothing they could do and still charged her $160!
Needless to say, my family will not be going back there.

Best haircut that I had in a very long time!
Wanting something completely new, I decided to have my below the shoulder length hair cut short, very short as in above the ears short.
On a whim, I called and made an appt for the same afternoon.
The stylist, Janae, saw me right on time.
She was extremely friendly and very vivacious.
When I showed her a picture of what I wanted, she was surprised and made sure that I truly wanted to make such a drastic change.
She did such a fantastic job!
I love my new look as does everyone else.
I will be going back to Janae for sure and am happily recommending her to everyone I know.
Oh, and the prices at Arizona Hair Co cannot be beat.
"Chain" salons tend to get a bad rap, but I do know that a stylist in an exclusive salon charging 3 times the price could not have done a better job!
