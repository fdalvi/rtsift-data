City Center on the Vegas Strip is a beautiful example of modern design, almost a Modern Art Museum masquerading as several hotels.
So you would expect nothing less that the Crystals Mall Starbucks would reflect this impressive design - and it delivers.
A beautiful, modern-architected Starbucks, near the state-of-the-art Aria Hotel, that will have you constantly looking up and around  to soak in your surroundings.
Oh, and by the way - the coffee is great, as usual!
Also, the Crystal Mall website reports: "In addition to the standard Starbucks menu items, this location will carry special items hand prepared by Aria's culinary team every day, all for under $10.
" What more could you want?
Entrance to Crystal Mall off S Las Vegas Blvd is the easiest entrance to find this Starbucks.
Just a short walk straight thru mall from that entrance.
It's on the mezzanine level near the Grand Staircase.

Way overpriced Starbucks in a stinky mall.
Gross.
And this is from someone with a Starbucks addiction.
Certified.

There's honestly no reason for me to review yet another Starbucks, but I think this location earns the distinction of being the most expensive Starbucks location.
I understand that in this changing market, Starbucks are getting more expensive.
I get that.
Nestled in the Crystals Mall, this Starbucks has some of the most interesting decor.
I mean, it is Vegas on the Strip.
With a convenient location right in the center of many hotels, I can see why this would be a go-to place to grab a coffee after a long night out.
Frankly, it's not worth it.
I ordered two grande drinks, and the cost totaled to over $12.
Seriously?
I wasn't ordering any fancy frappuccinos with the works or anything like that.
I was simply ordering normal hot lattes and stuff, and lo and behold, I'm paying like $6 each for coffee.
If I wanted expensive coffee, I'd hit up a brand name coffee shop elsewhere.
There are other Starbucks locations on the Strip, and while I don't know the prices there, I recommend trying those instead.
They also did not have a scanner for the app.
Seriously?
TIP: Seriously?
