Dr. John Williams and Cathy Guinan, NP are the practitioners I see in this office.
Being in the health field, I know educated, and spectacular doctors.
Dr. Williams might be one of the nicest men in the world.
He has a caring approach, remembers names and faces and would seriously do anything for his patients.
He has his private practice here, works for Hospice of the Valley, and also is the main doctor for a large local Assisted Living Facility.
He is not only a very intelligent man, his heart is gold.
He provides that more caring feel that seems to be lost in some Physicians nowadays.
Cathy is just as wonderful!
She listens, takes her time, asks questions, and doesn't "lecture".
These two do not make you feel "badly" for lifestyle choices and make you feel so comfortable.
It's very important for me to be able to be honest with my doctor's, so I can get proper care and treatment.
You can do that here!
They take the time to really listen.
The front desk staff is pleasant.
The office is old, can get crowded.
No updated furniture or fancy ambiance... To me this doesn't matter.
The quality of care does, and what you get here I just cannot compare to anyplace else.

Unfortunately I have been a patient for 10 years.
Today I am sick and really need help and although I was in 3 days ago for a checkup to renew my prescriptions - mandatory every 3 months regardless of being healthy - I sat for an hour in a waiting room with several sick and coughing people.
Today I am sick and coughing and can get no help from my doctor here.
My husband is out if town, I have a puppy who is vomiting and a 10 year old and cannot get in to see the doctor, but they said they can't fit me in anyway.
They told me they changed their policies about calling in medicine- I was never informed.
Goodbye squaw peak family physicians.
