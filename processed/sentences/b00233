I've been going to this interdependently owned video game store since the owner's first location in the early 90's!
This definitely is the best video game shop in Madison!
I mean, the only other places I can think of are PrePlayed or Half-Price Books for older cartridge based games.
I usually hang around to talk and bring in super random gaming goods to sell or trade!
Highly recommended!
Believe It!

It' where you should go to buy and sell games.
Avoid Gamestop and the other chains.
Keep this guy in business.
He isn't always able to buy your stuff, so call ahead of time if you have something specific to sell.

Well, I was gonna call this "Madison's retro gaming Mecca," but a previous reviewer has already used the term.
Oh, what the hell, this is Madison's retro gaming Mecca.
I've never seen a video game store around that has quite the selection of classic games as this place.
I mean, sure, there's garbage games to wade through, but occasionally you find a real classic.
Last time I was in Madison I was able to pick up bunch of games through their buy one, get one 50% off sale.
I picked up Metroid Prime (which is gold to me, I love the Metroid series and I never was able to play the Prime trilogy when it was new) and a Medal of Honor game for Gamecube, as well as a couple of newer XBox 360 games to try out.
I had a great time looking at the old Nintendo and Sega merch that they have collecting in display cases.
There's classic advertisements for old systems and just tons of cool stuff everywhere.
The same guy who runs the store is in there every time I've been in.
He's a very nice guy, and shoots straight from the hip when it comes to recommending a game.
He commented on my fianc√©e's tattoo one time she was in there and sparked a great conversation.
He can be a bit caught up in his work if he gets to doing something, so you definitely need to speak up when it's time for you to check out or he might not notice.
Aside from that, this store is without-rival.
