This is a great church for every population.
Although it is mostly a young hipster crowd, the number of elderly and families has increased a great amount since we started attending church here.
Being a born and raised Catholic married to a Christian, I felt it was an easy transition.
They explain bible verses into information that can be applied into real life, which is key to making information stick for me.
And they provide Eucharist (although I'm not sure that's what you call it outside of the Catholic Church) where you eat bread and wine to symbolize the body of Christ.
They have some incredible programs that help refugees and other needy populations and you get to meet the people receiving help in person, so it's wonderful to hear from the person first-hand, the help that comes from donations.
The music is incredible with such talented musicians that bring the crowd alive and they are all pretty much hipsters so they give the music a modern twist.

I attended this church for several years.
Recently, I discovered this church teaches reformed theology otherwise known as Calvinism.
This is not a doctrine that I believe in, but many others do.
I encourage you do your own research on this subject before getting involved.
