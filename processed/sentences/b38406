Super cute clothes, super cheap prices!
I absolutely love little boutiques like this with non-boutique prices :)

Good merchandise, crappy customer service.
I don't want to hear you and your coworker talk about what you're doing for Halloween while you cash me out.
At least wait til I walk away.
Shame.

Customer service is great!
