Erin's is great..  An under-appreciated spot.
Big clean bar with good prices and good people..
Pool tables, darts, lots of TV's, plenty of seats and a decent jukebox.
Stop in and check it out..  Get a $1.50 PBR while you're at it.
Biker friendly!

This seems like it could be a cool place But here it is at 10:00 pm on a Saturday night and the place is all but dead

This bar is now "Dodey's".
Sold just under a year ago.
*See "Dodey's reviews.
