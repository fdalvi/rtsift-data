You need to be patient to wait ur food in here :) more than 10 minutes for 2 hamburger deluxes:)

This is a good place to stop going to or coming from Vegas.
Same consistent JITB food and the counter help is always pleasant.

On the drive to Phoenix from Vegas, there's a long stretch of highway between Wikieup and Wickenburg.
This place is a nice place to stop, stretch, buy some food, fill up on gas, and have a restroom break.
It's attached to a convenience store that has plenty of snacks and adequate bathrooms to handle a busy rush.
The gas station is a Mobil brand of gas with wide lanes and plenty of parking.
It's always on our list of places to stop during a road trip.
