Ashley was a great server.
She had a suggestion for everything on the menu.
We were there for Happy Hour which is everyday from 4PM-7PM.
When we ordered the fish tacos, she suggested adding a great verde sauce- which wasn't on the menu.
I ordered the house margarita on the rocks.
They're made from a mix and the first one was tasty and the second one seemed a little heavier on the mix.
Happy Hour margaritas were $2.50.

We went there a while ago, when they just opened up, so this might be a little dated, but ...
It was not good.
SLOOOOOOW service, boring food.
Maybe booze is good there but we did not have any for lunch.
All in all, i felt kind of bad that i dragged my guys there.
"I no like"  Eugene

**PLEASE NOTE**  I have received a formal apology from Juan Jaime Himself in regards to my bad experience.
I think that was the right thing to do, he is looking out for his business and cares what his customers think.
I also appreciate his offer to come back and try again at his expense.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Although I cant change my first experience Juan has gone above and beyond to make me a happy customer, that's gotta count for something.
+1 star ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Well, where should I start!
*Note to self, if  a place is empty at lunch time does it mean only drunks eat here at night?
That would be a pretty good guess!
My daughter and I were running errands all day and saw this place on our way home and decided to stop.
We ordered a couple sodas, some chips and salsa, which by the way they charge you for, even though they serve chips with your entree and have an open salsa bar???
Salsa was OK but the chips were stale and had been sitting in their own grease too long.
I got the 2 tacos, one carnitas and one mahi mahi.
(see pics) Greasy and Bland with Mushy Meat and just plain not good!
Although I could see where someone full of tequila might think these were the best things they ever tasted, if that even counts, I Think not!
My daughter ordered the small burrito, which we thought was just a smaller version of the regular burrito.
She asked for just beans and steak inside.
Well no need to waste a flash on that one, it arrived just as plain and boring as the tacos and if there was ANY steak in that burrito it must have been pre-chewed.....cause I've never seen any steak like that before and been charged and extra $2.50 for it,  where's the Beef Juan?
What a Total waste of money!
I agree with Eugene.T  I No Likey!!

They just celebrated their 1st year anniversary around July 4th.
They have great food at an even better then average price.
The staff has always been wonderful and the owners are there all the time making sure everything runs smoothly.
Tuesday nights they have a special Taco & Tequila special for $20.
The standard taco meal with 2 shots of tequila to sample or 4 half shots if you prefer.
One of these Tuesday night I'm going to get there for that special!

I went here for happy hour drinks and tacos.
Drinks were good.
I have a few Beers( which a generally good) and their house margarita.
I have certainly had better margs other places, but it was by no means bad.
Middle of the road.
It was however dirt cheap.
$2.50.
Decent Chips, Ok salsa  I order the two tacos with chicken.
They came out less than 5 minutes later and the were yummy.
They were not worth $7 though.
I would say more like $4 MAX.
Overall I will come back here for drinks, maybe get an appetizer.
The food was on the more expensive side for what you get.
Just an FYI.
They have loads of different kinds of tequila.
If that is your thing check it out.
The place is in a strip mall type place next to the Cox Store, but had a Urban hip-ness on the inside.

This place rocks.
I have been there twice and the staff is friendly, food is excellent and pricing is great.
I will be visiting there often!!

This is a new fav happy hour place for us, we've already been here twice this week.
It's pretty close to our house, great happy hour and great service, both times we've been there, our servers were really cool.
Oh, and the food is pretty good too, especially for being so inexpensive.
Can't beat $2.50 margaritas, they aren't the biggest margaritas, but...$2.50, I'm not going to complain.
I had a steak taco last night, it was pretty dang good, and they have a salsa bar.
My fiance loved his burrito.
There is also a nice little patio.

I went in to see an old coworker who owns this joint.
Although he was not in I found the staff very attentive and the food was quick and very tasty.
Looking for a cold drink and tasty mexican, I suggest this resturant.

I travel to Mexico quite a bit and the food in Mexico isn't at all the same as most Mexican food here in the States.
There are a few and I mean very few places in phoenix where you can get Tacos like they serve on the streets in Mexico.
Juan Jaime's is as close as I have found although they use a slightly larger tortilla than most street Taco vendors in the homeland.
This place is great for lunch and we get in and out fairly quick.
At night it is also good and sometimes gets a nice bar crowd.
It has a great atmosphere as well!
I like it Mucho!

Let me start by saying I'm really into tequila.
Ok, really, really into tequila...Juan Jamie's has a diverse selection of tequila's (80 or so) and for me, this place is all about the happy hour special.
Two tacos and two pours of premium tequila (anything under $15/pour) all for $18.
Super cheap.
My receipt had something like a $20 discount off normal prices (even their normal prices are are on the lower end for what I was drinking).
In addition, the bartender was jovial and knowledgeable about the selections.
I'll be back the next time I'm in Chandler!

Just went tonight.
Was looking for some late night Mexican food and atmosphere a step above most things that are open this late and found success.
This place is definitely trying to pull off cool and I think they do a pretty good job of it.
Their expansive selection of Tequila, enhances the mood they set out to create.
I do not like that you had to pay for chips and salsa but the food was pretty cheap for how nice the restaurant was, so I think it evens out.
They might charge for chips because it's the kind of restaurant where you could spend several hours drinking and if people ate chips the whole time that was happening it wouldn't be profitable.
I say this because their alcohol is a good deal.
16 oz.
Dos Equis for four bucks on tap and it wasn't happy hour!
This place is a balance of modestly priced mexican, drinking and nice atmosphere.
The food is not amazing but it's good, and with the atmosphere and wanting to eat at 11 at night this restaurant/bar is overall impressive.
(If weren't for the late late night aspect would probably only give it three stars)

Second tripwas better than the first.
Taco's are worth the trip.

I'm a big fan of this place.
Usually come here with Tori B. as she is the only reason I venture out to Chandler.
They have an excellent happy hour for drinks $2.50 margs, $4 Tres Olives and $1 off beer and wine.
The food is pretty basic (and honestly priced a tad high for what it is).
They have fish, shrimp, steak, pork and veggies.
You can have these served up in a taco, burrito or salad.
Like I said pretty basic.
What really sets this place apart is the owner and the service.
Every time I come in he is super friendly and always asks us to try new things he is thinking of adding to the menu.
One time it was a spicy jalapeño corn, and last time it was a honey chipotle vinaigrette.
The vinaigrette was awesome and he even gave me the recipe (no I will not share it).
If you're in Chandler and looking for a cheap happy hour in decent environment give Juan's a try.
You'll be glad you did.

Since I have not had the chance to partake in their happy hour, my review will be based solely on the food and service.
Probably the best thing about this place is value for your money.
Yes, you do have to pay $1.75 for chips and salsa, but when you can get a burrito for $6.95, it ends up being a great value.
With a few sprinkles of salt, the chips were good and the salsa bar gives you the chance to enjoy different flavors with your chips (and meal.
)  I had the carnitas burrito which was tasty, but was made unevenly such that all the rice was on one side and all of the carnitas and beans were on the other side.
Not too big of a deal; I just had to be strategic in piecing together my bites.
The nice thing is that it was a good size burrito; not some "as big as your head" monstrosity.
I was full after the meal so I didn't get a chance to try any of their desserts, but the Kahlua brownie with ice cream sounded delicious.
Maybe next time...

Overpriced and nothing special.
Tried it twice in a year.
Money better spent elsewhere.

I saw a bad review which really surprises me.
I go there often, but wouldn't call myself a regular.
I don't know any bartenders' names or anything.
But, I've never had a bad taco, bad service or bad anything ever here.
The crowd always seems chill.
The patio is nice.
I like the red lighting.
Good for street watching too.
Their food always tastes fresh and their salsa bar is very yummy!
Tequilas-great selection.
I believe Herradura is one of my faves.
I say, can't go wrong with this spot.
If you like a casual fresh Mexican kind of sporty type bar with a lot of modern touches and nice staff, don't see why you wouldn't enjoy!

usually, just thinking about drinking a margarita gives me heartburn.
that canned sweet-n-sour mix or whatever sucks big time.
im glad to report, the margaritas here are the shiznit!
they come in a really small glass but are super tasty, strong and cheap (during happy hour).
the salsa bar is good but all of their salsas are pretty hot.
usually the salsa verde is not hot only tasty, but here it is one of the hottest ones.
i figured out the radishes help distill the heat afterwords, though, fyi.
the mahi tacos are rather bland, but the others are good.
i also like how they have melted cheese in between the two tortillas.
gf said the shrimp tacos are delish - ill have to try those next time.

Overall, a very nice experience.
The food is very reasonable and pretty decent.
The salsas are meh, nothing to write home about.
The service is pretty good and they have a lengthy happy hour during the week.
The music is a little bit loud at times, but seating is not a problem and there is a nice patio area.

I LOVE this place!!!!!!
The food is so good, and not expensive and actually tastes like Mexican food!!!
I love the house salsa and the cheese quesidillas and the salsa bar!
Wait I love it all!
A must go!

We went late on a Sunday afternoon and just made it in time for their lunch specials.
Three mini tacos was the perfect amount of food and it allowed me to try three different kinds.
I got the steak, shrimp, and chicken tacos.
The steak and chicken were really good, the shrimp taco was good too, but I'm partial to the Baja Fresh shrimp taco-that one is my favorite.
My boyfriend got the carnitas taco and said it was really good too.
I wasn't too impressed with the salsas.
The green one was my favorite.
The atmosphere was great for either a quiet afternoon lunch, but I could also see it being a really fun place for night life too!
I can't wait to go back and order a margarita!
I love the simple, straight-forward menu and the extremely reasonable prices.
Our server/bartender was very nice too!

Juan Jaime's is just kind of eh.
Every time I try a new Mexican place I have these grandiose ideas that I'm going to discover some new and exciting taco's that'll blow my little mind and make me feel like I'm eating at a little taco stand in Mexico.
Well... as you can probably guess, I'm usually pretty disappointed when that doesn't happen 99 out of 100 times.
Well, chalk up another dead soldier in my search for amazing Mexican food in AZ.
Juan Jaime's turned out to be pretty average... decent assortment of various standard Mexican dishes; okay prices, pretty fresh flavor... but no 'wow factor'.
With Mexican food, you've gotta do something to separate yourself.
I can close my eyes and point to almost any cross street in Arizona and be within walking distance of a dozen Mexican restaurants.
So why the hell do so many of them play it so safe?
I guess there's nothing wrong with places like this... the food is good enough; I just feel like I could make the same stuff if given the same ingredients at home...
I want to be amazed when I go out to eat, not paralyzed by averageness!
Maybe the tequila part of the menu is a little more fun, too bad I don't drink.
Who knows if I'll ever go back to Juan Jamie's... probably will just file it under my ever growing list of average Mexican spots I only eat at if I'm desperately craving some south of the border food.
Blaaaaah.

I had lunch here the other day and over all my experiences was okay.
Nothing to rave about and nothing to complain about either.
My friend and I both had the Grilled Steak, which was flavored very nicely.
The wait staff during the lunch hour were extremely nice.
If you in the area and looking for a place to eat, give this place a try.

Fantastic service.
Simple menu with gret tacos and salsa.

Went there for Friday night happy hour based on Yelpers' reviews and the suggestion of a friend.
Close to home, so figured why not?
Did not expect how wonderful it would be.
We got there close to 7 and were able to score a table in the bar area.
Had the $3 house margarita (rocks with salt) and was delighted that it didn't suck.
It was actually quite good for the money.
Had the two taco dealie - one grilled chicken, one steak - in the crispy shells ...
I think about them daily and cannot wait to go back for more!!!
Is it wrong to daydream about tacos?
LOL!
Yeah, we had to pay for our chips and salsa, but it was bottomless chips and they were fresh and crispy, and the salsa was very fresh and oh so tasty.
Good variety on the salsa bar.
Highly recommend!
Oh, and one of the bartenders is total eye candy ;)  Bonus!!!
Oh!
And I also love that their happy hour runs until 8PM which is great for people who get off work late.

My wife and I have been coming to JJ's since about 3 months after it opened, a little more than 3 years ago and we love it here.
They have great happy hour prices (no watered down margaritas for only $3) and they have the best salsa in town.
With two small children (3 and 1 1/2), this is a great place that we can come and experience a happy hour environment (responsibly, of course) with the children.
We always have great service and that make Juan Jaime's our favorite Friday night hang out.

I am bummed.
Odd happening, been there twice, loved the food/margs - had the same waitress twice - and both times what I wrote on the credit card slip and what my bank statement reflected were different.
Like my server was tipping herself extra.
$3 the first visit, $1 the second visit.
I find that very odd.
Taking cash next time.
:(  Food is too good to boycott.
Might have to speak with the owner.

Have to say that the fact that the owners of Juan Jaime's follow Yelp and care enough about their service and customer satisfaction to contact someone who has had a negative experience made me up my rating to 5 stars.
Turns out the credit card discrepancy issue was indeed my fault.
My sincerest apologies to Mr. James and the Yelpers who may have read my update and gotten any kind of negative opinion about Juan Jaime's.

MARGARITA time....I love their ritas on the rocks!!!
Their shrimp tacos are my favorite in town.
I love the salsa bar.
The wait staff has always been nice.
The prices of  food and drink are great.
This is a great place to go with friends to eat good mexican food & kick back a few drinks.
The patio area is nice all year round.

Nice location - okay food.
This place took over ChopSticks according to a friend and kept some of the decor ha!
I can dig - recycle!
ChopSticks to Juan Jaime's??
Go figure!
Food was decent I'm not bashing it but if I can order the same at the Baja Fresh com'on!
They have great happy hour prices and for a long time too 4pm to 8pm!
Service was lacking....and the place can get kinda loud...what?
I said LOUD!
I think if you're hanging with the boys tonight for happy hour I would recommend this place -- otherwise go elsewhere for food.

Well....as a huge fan of fish tacos, I was excited to try this place and see what they offered.
Meh.
I had fish tacos and my husband had i think had the chicken tacos and we both left hungry.
For the price you pay for the meal (if you'd call it a meal) it leaves you very empty.
Maybe not bad for a late night bite to eat and a drink but I wouldn't suggest going for a dinner.
Oh and the fish tacos were just average.

I ate here the other night with my boyfriend and a friend.
We were planning on visiting anyway, but we got a coupon for a free appetizer and that pretty much cinched it.
We went during happy hour so we all indulged in the $3 margaritas.
I got the watermelon (on the rocks), which I loved.
My boyfriend got the house maragrita (on the rocks), which he wasn't crazy about it, and my friend got the peach (blended) which really wasn't all that great.
We got the nachos, which were about $7.
I was surprised to see that it was just chips and cheese with some salsa and jalapenos on the side.
They do have a salsa bar with different kinds of salsa and also lettuce and cabbage, but when I think nachos I also think sour cream and at least some kind of beans or ground beef of it.
Not to say it wasn't tasty, just not really what I was expecting.
For dinner I got a combo of a cheese enchilada and a steak taco with rice and beans on the side.
The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the enchilada, but everything else was tasty.
For dessert we got sopapillas.
These were tasty (how can you go wrong with fried dough?
), but had a little too much cinnamon (this is coming from a girl who *likes* her cinnamon).
They were also served with warm honey, which was good.
My friend and boyfriend were only so-so about the sopapillas.
It was a pretty good eat, although I don't know if I'd become a regular.

Really good tacos.
Generic beer selection.
Had a slow/rude/lazy Bartender.

Here are my thoughts about Juan Jaime's: - I can't believe they charge for chips and salsa.
This is not Taco Bell, it's a sit down restaurant.
- I asked for more salsa and the server said to me "Oh, it's right over there at the salsa bar.
" Apparently I have to get my food myself.
Not the best customer service.
- The menu is limited.
That being said, I did enjoy by pork burrito, which was recommended by my server.
- The happy hour specials are pretty good.
I enjoyed my strawberry margarita made with a top shelf tequila.
I really want to love Juan Jaime's because the food options directly around Chandler Mall are limited to mostly family chain restaurants.
Not sure we will be back.

- the food is bland - their wildly-touted "salsa bar" is boring, and 4' by 4' large - the waitstaff is, sigh, boring - the bill is 50% higher than you'd expect for bland food/service/atmosphere  It's unlikely that things will get better, so it's unlikely that I will recommend friends/family.
The signage and hype are cool to see, though, and their location is excellent.
Bottom line:  don't bother

overpriced and poor quality food.
the service was slow.
We had an hour for and had to get to go boxes once they finally gave us our food.
was never given a drink refill in the hour we were there.

**UPDATE** Totally earned more points in my book that the owner cares to read the reviews.
The menu said they charged for chips.
Its good to know that they don't.
I will definitely be coming back.
Overall it was a nice place.
_______________________________________________________ This was the first time I had ever been.
I found it online and decided to go to happy hour.
The atmoshere was lively with a variety of people eating, drinking, and talking.
The food was great.
I got two tacos (steak and carnitas) which was delicious.
The beans and rice are ok, I have had better.
You also can't beat the cheap and strong happy hour margaritas.
I was feeling good after two.
The salsa bar was a nice touch.
Now for what I would suggest.
I think its crazy that you have to pay for chips but the salsa bar is free??
Also, please get more waiters.
Our waiter has several tables to wait on and it took forever.
Poor guy was running all night.
While the table next to us had their own personal waitress.
This is a nice place for happy hour with freinds.
Just be prepared for a long dinner waiting on the server.

I love this place!
Have tried almost everything on the food menu.
You can't go wrong it's all good but my favorites are the nachos, shrimp tacos and grilled steak platter.
If you like spicy - try the green salsa at the salsa bar.
The tequila selection is good and they have a few awesome organics.
The house margaritas are tasty and a very good deal.

Carnitas and mahi fish tacos are great here!
Your choice of taco shell is a nice touch as well.
Solid bar, fantastic tequila selection!
Not sure about prior reviews citing high prices.
None of the food items are over $10.

Went here after I got off work last Friday night and had the best shot ever!
Everyone should go and try a "Snowball!
" it looks like a drink with the ice in it, but your supposed to chug it down like you would a mind eraser.
Definetly gets you feeling good, you shouldnt need many more drinks after that for a good night, =]

Was in Phoenix on business and found a local tex mex place near my hotel in Chandler area.
Glad that I went to Juan Jaime's Tacos...great food, service and fun people to meet & talk with at the bar.
I had the tortilla soup (nice & spicy) and two tacos.
All for great value.
I will definitely be back next time I'm back in Chandler.

Stopped in here with the hubby after shopping at the mall all afternoon.
We were both hungry but just wanted a quick bite and didn't want to deal with the mediocre chains around Chandler mall that are always so packed on weekend evenings.
Didn't know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had Happy Hour going on, even though it was the weekend.
We ordered the trio of dips to start.
The queso and salsa were both good though too thin IMHO.
The guacamole was nice and thick - I am not a fan of the stuff but my husband said it was like pure avocado with just seasonings added (which he liked).
Then he ordered some tortilla soup and I got a shrimp tostada then we also shared a combo plate.
Overall, I would say this is really not authentic Mexican food at all but still pretty tasty.
I would have just given it three stars but I added one more because they have my all-time favorite drink, the Michelada.
For those of you who don't know what that is, it is a beer mixed with tomato juice or clamato and you add lime juice, hot sauce, Worcestershire, and other misc spices.
I make mine at home with Corona Light and Mister T's Bloody Mary mix.
Of course it is better when done by a professional, but at most places when I ask for it they don't know what it is, even at Mexican restaurants.
Then when I explain it they stare at me like I'm crazy.
It may sound weird if you've never had one but is is the most delicious, refreshing drink ever.
They made it perfectly at Juan Jaime's and served it in a chilled glass with sweet chilli powder on the rim.
It was great!
I will come back to this place again just for that drink.
I was also very impressed with the tequila menu, it took up the whole page!
Overall, the food at this place is similar to Rubios or Chipotle but the atmosphere is way cooler.
There were no kids running around, and it had a great bar.
It seems like the perfect happy hour place.
I really liked the patio but I just wish it didn't face the street.
The location in Scottsdale looks like it is bigger and not in a strip mall.
But in Chandler we have to take what we can get I guess.

Just went here to celebrate my mom's birthday with our whole family of 15 people.
The service was great, always had a full drink and basket of chips.
The chicken tacos are about as good as they get!
Absolutely delicious!
The salsa bar is amazing as well.
Didn't drink on this occasion but definitely looks like a great place for happy hour .. $2.50 domestic drafts, $3.00 margaritas.
The server even brought my mom a margarita with a candle lit in the middle of it!
Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a great taco and happy hour!!

Very underwhelming...
I used to really like Juan Jamie's, but now that I've experienced Canteen on Mill Ave I realize it's just not that good.
The margaritas are pretty weak, the chips and salsa or chips and whatever you might order are grossly overpriced and the tacos are just not all that flavorful... totally "meh" in every way.

This is a nice little place to hang out for drinks and pretty yummy food.
The prices are  reasonable, especially their happy hour prices.
My fiance is a big tequila fan so he was very happy with the large tequila menu.
This place gets pretty packed sometimes so we always end up sitting outside because it's SO LOUD inside.
That is my only real gripe about it.
The food was pretty good, nothing amazing, but pretty yummy.
It's a nice place to just hang out.

This location is a little tricky to find...
It's in the back of the shopping center, right next to the Cox Communications store.
This place is very good.
They have a great selection of authentic Mexican food, and they also have a very great Tequila bar.
If you are planning on drinking, make sure that you go for their Happy Hour.
They have some great drink specials.
What's nice about this place is that the charge for the food is based off of what you get, not the meat.
You can get a burrito with Grilled Mahi Mahi, and it is the same price as their Grilled Steak.
Very tasty.
Also, make sure that you get some Chips and Salsa.
They have a great salsa bar with very fresh salsas and toppings.
Their chips are cooked right there, and they have that great thin and crisp texture that makes eating them quite addicting.
If you're looking for some great Mexican food right around the corner from the Chandler Fashion Center, look no further.
This is the place to be!

Phenom.
The food is always fresh and well seasoned.
A good selection of Tequila.
Every meal that I've had has been just fantastic.
The carnitas and the fish taco's are very well prepared.
It's fresh, the beans are fresh as is the rice.
It averages about $10 a plate but worth it.
This is how really good Mexican should be.
The salsa bar is excellent: you have about 5 different types of salsa from which to choose.
All freshly made.
I can't say enough about the flavoring of the meats and fish.
Decor is a somewhat minimalist/modern, probably to attract a happy hour crowd.
They have TV's for your viewing pleasure.
Service is friendly and quick.
I've only been to the Chandler location but will start going to the one in Scottsdale.
Good food.
You won't be disappointed.

The BF and I LOVE this place!
Their Margaritas are great...and potent.
We've never actually ordered the chips and salsa, but they always bring us some anyway.
Their salsas are good....but not great.
I love that you choose what filling you want in whatever menu item you pick.
Another great spot for us vegetarians.
We've only been there for lunch, but I'd like to give their happy hour a try!
Definitely recommend!

Love this place.
Everyone we bring with us really seems to enjoy it too.
Great value.
Great salsa.
Great food and service is always quick and friendly.
Would be nice to have a couple more types of salsa though.
We've had some chipotle and mango salsas at a couple of other places that I'm betting Juan Jaime's could do really well.

I went last Sunday with a friend n I was really surprise about how many tequilas they have for not a big place not a big fan of it but it's nice the fact a mexican place has that.
For other part they have clamato and squirt!!!
How many bars have that????
Actually one of the only ways I drink tequila is with squirt :) so I was really happy .....  My friend had the tacos n they looked amazing they looked like real tacos def have to come back to try those!!
And come back for a great service with Aaron....

Awful food bad service.
Anything else?
I worked by here for a while and some team members liked to come into this place at lunch for drinks.
Even the cheese crisp SUCKS!

Ok here's an update.
Just to give a little back info the owner of JJ emailed me through yelp because he was concerned about my low review and bad experience.
I thought that was kind of impressive he would actually care that much.
He was nice and I had kind of forgotten about it.
Well it was a really pretty day in AZ and I happened to be in the neighborhood so I decided to give it another try.
Maybe it could have been an isolated incident and I don't like to be an evil yelper.
I choose to sit outside since it was so nice and I was immediately helped and got a drink fast ( good start ).
Ordered the veggie tacos which came out promptly.
This was about the same time I ate here last time just for reference.
Taylor my waiter informed me there is a salsa bar so I headed inside to grab some salsa verde.
The tacos were quite good as well as the rice and salsa verde.
I'm not usually a fan of black beans, but they really were nice.
I would give it 3.5 stars for food, but maybe since I am in a good mood today and Taylor was a very cheerful and excellent waiter I am going with 4.
I'll be back, but so far seems like I just hit them on a bad day last time.

The fish tacos are delicious and margaritas are strong.
Great meal for the price.
Oh and the salsa is good too.

A great neighborhood taco shop and you can't beat the happy hour til 8!

Have been here for dinner once in the past week.
Service was attentive, and the food good.
Margarita was ok. Will most likely visit again.

I like the service my drinks came really fast.
The waiter/bartender was really cool and friendly, he called me "boss"; I love it when waiters call me "boss", anyways.
I wasn't a big fan of the dish wear, I don't like being served good food in a plastic tray but the food was delicious.

Good food, Good service and good ambience.
Love the shrimp tacos and their salsa bar is awesome.

Great food great prices.
Good friendly service.
Food always comes out crazy fast.

"I love this place because it is healthy Mexican food and they cater to vegetarians/ vegans.
Their salsa bar is great and you must order the 3 Amigos appetizer!

We stopped here for lunch the other day, in the mood for something a little spicy (and cheap).
I ordered the grilled steak tacos and boyfriend got the carnitas.
I don't normally love pork, but we each traded one of our tacos and both kinds were delicious :] The salsa bar IS a little limited, but there were two that I loveddd so I didn't really need more options.
Our total bill for chips and salsa (refills included), 4 tacos with rice and beans was $15.00...sold!!!
Food was great, we will definitely be coming back!

Fresh food, very reasonably priced, and an awesome selection of tequila.
Need I say more?
An added plus, they have great happy hour selections and a misted patio.

Came here for lunch with some work friends earlier today.
The service was prompt even with the seat yourself method for lunch.
I ordered the tacos plate.
The food came within about 15 min which for 4 people wasn't too bad.
The beans were the best thing on my dish which probably isn't the best thing considering its for tacos.
The tacos were just ok nothing great and the salsa bar wasn't superb as many people said it has about 3 good salsas in my opinion at least.
None of the salsas  in my opinion provided that punch i was looking for.
Customer Service was awesome food just didn't match.

Food and drinks are great!
Service has been lacking both times I've been here.

Great place nice food and wonderful tequila selection, ask for Erin at the bar for the best service.

I like this place I sometimes crave their tacos yumm!
Cute,small, service is nice.
I'm a regular now :)

In quiet chandler there isn't many options.
This is a pretty good place.
Crowd is young in the evening, especially after all the local servers get off work and come here to spend their tips.
Get the tacos trio.
Get the margarita special and keep em coming.

Spicy mango margarita on happy hour!
It's the best thing they've got.
I always get the chicken burrito with a wheat tortilla and black beans, with the rice on the side.
They give you a generous portion and I'm able to add as much or as little as I want to my burrito, depending on how hungry I am.
Their happy hour is great, and they have an awesome range of margaritas and beers.
I also have to say that they are SUPER willing to help you plan an event.
They've offered to set aside the patio for a large party, and they really seem to take the time to help you without being difficult.
I never felt like I was an inconvenience to make requests of them.
They have wonderful customer service.
Get there early on Friday/Saturdays, because it WILL fill up.
The food is great for the price and quality.
Also, try the taco sauce on the salsa bar.
It's spicy, but SO GOOD.

First of all, you get to seat yourself.
That's kind of nice being able to sit where you want to.
But when you think of having to seat yourself, you probably imagine a fast food restaurant.
This place is pretty classy and tastefully decorated.
Meals are cheap.
I ordered the cheese quesadilla appetizer as my main dish for $3.75 and it was humongous.
I was only able to eat half of it.
Happy hour specials are good too.
I got a margarita for $3.50.
Service was great and quick.
The only down side to this place are the menu options.
There is not much to choose from.
However, it does seem like you can add and substitute items which creates a little more variety with the menu.
I would definitely come here again in the near future.

I don't "Yelp" much but this place deserves a good review!
We strolled in a few weeks ago after shopping at Nordstrom Rack and enjoyed their happy hour, and then went back the next night for dinner.
This is the one Mexican place my husband and I can go to and not feel sick afterwards.
Their food is super fresh and the 3 servers we have had on the 3 different times we have visited have all been great -- attentive and welcoming.
After living in Chandler for 2 years now, I'm just bummed I didn't find this place sooner!

So I tried this place based on previous reviews.
I ordered their burrito with rice and beans, normal size portions.
They provide chips and salsa with several types of salsa available.
The meal itself was OK, nothing over the top.
The location is a strip shopping center, interesting décor inside with a full bar.
Maybe the allure is the bar with full meals available.
Not sure this is the place for me but give it a try.

My husband and I dine out quite often.
JJ's is always on our list every week or 10 days.
The food is always consistent.
No, it's not flashy, but you can count on a solid meal.
Besides the food and atmosphere which we enjoy, the staff is, in our opinion, top notch.
One person in particular knows exactly what we order, unless we throw him a curveball.
But the other waitresses come very close and are good.
So dinner for us, including alcohol, is around $25.
Where else can you have a solid experience, great food and service for that price?
Thanks JJ's!

Came here with an old High School friend to catch up.
We were there for four hours.
Prices were great.
However, we really felt like we were being pushed out by the waitress, whom we paid so she could leave.
She was very pleasant otherwise and good for the first half hour.
Plenty of room in the place for more tables, usually the only reason one pushes me out.
No one bothered to come after that to see if we needed anything.
I would have opened another tab.
Stingy on the chips, no one even asked if we wanted to purchase more.
Margaritas were good.
Food was so so.

Best for my taco cravings :)  Also, they have the only margaritas I will ever drink.
I am not a tequila fan, but the pomegranate margaritas are tasty!

One of the very few Mexican food restaurants in the local area that seems to let you taste the tequila in the margarita!
PROS: read my intro.
Also, the chips/salsa were decent  CONS: Ditch the specimen cup-sized container for the salsa, and bring a portion the patrons can enjoy  Been here once and haven't tried the food.
They get 4-stars from me because they serve a good marg.
Regrettably, too many local places seem to waive a cheap bottle of tequila over the ubiquitous ice cream machine-like contraption that holds the house margs, and pass off a Kool-Aid mix as a margarita.
Cheers!

Love their margaritas and tacos!

Awesome for good food, spicy bloodys, salsa bar and tequila.
Been going here almost weekly for five years.
The best taco/beer/tequila joint in the SE valley.

One of my meetup groups decided to have a meeting at Juan Jaime's.
I had driven by the location and never even noticed it!
Parking is a little crowded even though it is in a strip center.
We were promptly greeted and our server was wonderful - very attentive during the 3 hours we ate and drank.
We all tried the house Margaritas and not only are they strong, but they have a wonderful taste!
Chips were light and crunchy - I like that style even though they are oily.
Many salsas to choose from, all ranging from mild to medium in heat - nothing too spicy.
I had the tostada and taco plate and really enjoyed it.

Reasonable prices for reasonable portions.
You probably won't be taking a doggy bag home.
The salsa bar is fresh, and the service is speedy.

JJ's is a staple for my office.
It's close, consistent, and well priced.
Their Happy Hour is also a great value, and goes later from 4-8 pm DAILY.
Beat that!
$4 house margaritas pack a punch along with the value.
Not a ton of flavor - but take a trip to the salsa bar and add your own.
I feel like it's healthier with less grease and maybe that's the flavor compromise.
One of the best choices in the shopping center, by far.

I typically go here for a quick bite of Mexican food with friends or just to get a drink.
I like to order out due to the countless times I have had bad experience with one guy behind the bar.
He acts like he has a hang over and he couldn't get someone to cover his shift every time I go in.
LOL Decent food but small portions.
I want bigger burros!

Fresh Mexican food, affordable prices and awesome staff keeps my wife and I coming back at least every other week it seems!
The fresh salsa bar is stocked with mild to fiery selections to top your tacos, burritos, salads and chips.

The selection of tequilas is great, and the tacos are light, refreshing, and great tasting.

When you walk in the door...you are greeted with smile, a cold drink and delicious chips & salsa!
Carne Asada Street Tacos (mini's) are my family's absolute favorite....always fresh, hot and tasty!
If you are really hungry...order the Pork Burro Enchilada Style with Green Sauce....yummy & filling!

Love this place!!!
BUT!!!!
And it's a huge BUT!!!
Like KIM KARDASHIAN BIG!!!
Their music SUCKS!!!
Ace the Scottsdale club bullshit!
Give me some reggae beats, slightly!
Sublime!
That shit you play is wretch!!

I absolutely loveeee this place.
The staff is great.
I miss Sarah she was awesome but the rest of the staff that I see often are amazing too.
Is it bad they already know my order before I sit down?!
Great food, good prices and lots of tequila!

I really, REALLY want to give Juan Jaime's 4 Stars.
They have an extended happy hour from 4-8PM (even on the weekends) which includes $4 house margaritas.
Unfortunately, the food has been inconsistent our last few visits.
I would stick to HH drinks, chips and salsa!
If you do that, you can't go wrong.

What a great place.
For lunch, chose the Mahi-Mahi burrito with black beans and rice in flour tortilla with sour cream side.
Abundant chips with variety of salsas and different hotnesses.
Simple, fresh and tasty Tex-Mex.
Returned in the evening for well-made Margarita.
A quality margargita made with 1800 and Cointreau is $10.
House margaritas are $4...yep.
Based on freshness and value, highly rate Juan Jamie's, and will return.
Small gripe:  with the hard walls, the place is noisey for a conversation.

Drinks were good, strong.
Food: beef taco good, fish taco needs more fish, shrimp taco ok. Chips good salsa pretty standard.
Staff nice.

I've been wanting to try this place for a while.
Now that have, I'm good.
It's the kind of place you go to after a night of partying when your standards aren't so high.
It wasn't all THAT bad, but not great  either.
I judge Latin-style restaurants on their chips and salsa.
If it's not good, I know what to expect from their kitchen.
With that said.. the chips were greasy and salsa tasted like Pace picante.
I had the two taco plate of grilled chicken and steak tacos with re-fried beans and rice.
The grilled steak taco had good flavor, but the chicken was VERY dry.
I added lime and salsa to try and moisten it up.
All and all...it was decent, but not any better quality than a late night taco place.
Service was ok.

I had one of the best service experiences dining at Juan Jaime's tonight.
Adam, the bartender, was attentive and fun while waiting for my take out order.
The food is fantastic, but moreover the service was spot on.
Adam nailed it.

Great experience.
We met another couple here for Happy Hour and were pleasantly surprised with the quality of their food.
I had the chicken tacos and my boyfriend had the steak burrito.
The beans & rice were amazing!
The salsa bar in the back is a nice touch.
All reasonably priced and great service.
We'll be back!

Great food,  great service and a place to watch World Cup games at lunch time during work hours.
I had the three taco platter with shrimp,  pork,  and beef.
All were very good.
The salsa at the salsa bar was a nice addition.

I'm here all the time, it's the perfect neighborhood spot to grab a bite and drink and chill.
It's not obnoxious and overly loud, you can just grab a booth and relax, it's dark lighting and cool, it's NOT your typical mexican-cantina.
Dos Gringos has nothing on this place, I HATE DOS GRINGOS, it's sloppy, sticky, disgusting, and the food is garbage, not to mention the awful staff.
Juan Jaime's has good food, it's simple but good.
The staff at Juan's is also nice and accommodating, they know their people and take care of them the right way.
Juan Jaime's is a big win in my book for offering whole wheat tortillas...nobody else does I swear.
They make a good burrito, they make good tacos, it's a good bite every time, I never have a bad experience eating here, and I don't get bored of it either!
I love coming here to just chill and fill up, it's relaxed, it's cool, it's a place to be.

Pretty cool little taco joint if you are in the mood for some quick tacos...
I ate here a couple days ago for the first time.
Our tacos came out quick (i mean REALLY quick) and I admit that I was a little bit disappointed when I first saw them because they were small.
However they were tasty, especially with the help of the salsa bar - the salsa bar is awesome.
I will definitely return when I am in the mood for some quick tacos.

Oh my gosh...this place sticks.
Who are you newbs that are giving this place such high ratings?
It's Taco Bell with a bar.
Have you folks never been to Mexico, know Mexicans, ate at good Mexican rest?
Yelp lets me down every once and awhile.
The black beans seemed canned, the rice was dry and the taco meat was...well poor quality (see pic), I spit out as much as I ate.
The chips and salsa were the highlights and they were average.
Go to Si Senor in or Los Dos Molinos...trust me.

I've been to Juan Jaime's several times - both for lunch and happy hour.
I like the atmosphere here - it's relaxed, has an upscale feel to it and they play good music.
Later in the evening it can get fairly busy here and the noise level definitely increases.
Of course, the tequila probably contributes towards that...
The food is good - nothing super fancy, but quick and simple.
At lunch I usually go for the Tacos Trio (chicken), but I've also had their burritos and they are also good .
They have a great salsa bar with a lot of options.
The chips are okay - like someone else on here mentioned they can be greasy at times.
I would say I come here more for the happy hour than I actually do for dinner.
The bartenders stay on top of everyone and they have a very nice selection of tequilas.
Happy hour prices are competitive and the crowd that hangs out here is pretty social.
The service here is excellent - never had a bad experience.
I have to give a shout-out to Kaitlyn who took good care of us today during lunch.
If every place had a server like her, life would be good.
Definitely worth a visit - especially if you are looking to decompress after a long day or want to meet up with friends for a drink or two at the end of the day.

Great food!
Great service!
Anytime my husband and I come here we have a great experience.
An added bonus: you very easily veganize your meal!!
