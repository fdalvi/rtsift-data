I just had my annual MOT for the 40+ here.
To be really honest this place is due for an upgrade.
The building is tired and the interior features questionable.
It is also a maze.
The big waiting area is very open and consultation rooms are dotted around the waiting area.
Different rooms for different functions.
a talk/examine room, a weighing room, x-ray room.. etc.
I guess it serves its purpose.
Staff is very efficient and the nurses are friendly and to the point.
They have been supplied with ipads and laptops that look a little out of place in the tired setting.
I was in and out in 30min.
