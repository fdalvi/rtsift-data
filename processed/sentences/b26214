I frequent this dry cleaner because it is the closest one to my house.
The staff is nice and they appear to complete work on site.
They get the job done quick and my clothes are often ready before I can find time to pick them up.
If you drop your clothes off early enough in the morning, they will be ready by 5 pm on the next business day.
Prices vary depending on what you bring in but it's usually around 2 to 3 bucks per item.
You're supposed to pre-pay (pre-pay discount) but I think you can also opt to pay when you pick up, although it'll be more expensive.

I came across Big Apple Cleaners after searching on Yelp.
I needed an affordable and convenient place for dry cleaning after a recent move and Al Phillips is just not worth the price they charge.
Same day service is $1.00 extra per item, but still much less than AP.
The staff was friendly and my items were ready when promised and looked fantastic.
I will definitely return.

My first time actually getting something dry cleaned in years.
But it makes much more sense this way...
I don't have to hand wash all of my delicate clothes.
I love how close they are located to our house so dropping off and picking up is convenient.
There were some great reviews and so we decided to give it a shot.
They offer one day service as well as the option to pay before or after you pick it up.
We have done both with no issues.
They are always quick getting us in and have the clothes ready fast for pick up.
There prices are reasonable I have never had any problems regarding damages and things.
We will continue to frequent this location because it's convenient, fast and reliable.
