I took in three or four plastic grocery bags of cans at the end of  my last trip here and got about a dollar.
This trip I had about twice to three times that much, two kitchen trash bags full.
It still came to only $1.80 for three pounds.
At least it wasn't far to drive here, but still hard to justify the energy saving them other than the reward of knowing I was recycling.
I saw pickup trucks loaded with metals lined up going in a different entrance and the guy ahead of me inside the office got over $50, so I guess it's worth it if you have enough pounds of scrap metal.

This is certainly not the place to take cans...BUT for copper?
You can't beat this place.. after few visits, I've made at least 30% more than I anticipated..
The situation is efficient, and the staff is friendly and professional.
Parking can be a bit awkward, and there's nothing pretty about this place, which is why I love it.
I want to live in a scrap yard, when i grow up.

Updating my review to 5 stars: I'm glad Anthony D. of American Metals explained the price paid for aluminium cans, below.
The price does seem very fair with explanation, and as mentioned before, I feel American Metals Company is the best choice for a metal scrapping service in the east valley.

It's a bit out of the way, and I am more familiar with the Chandler yard, but this location is now the closer of the 2.
I've only been there a few times, so the getting in and out is a bit confusing still.
The staff has always been rather cool, however, and generally have been helpful.
Not like aluminum or steel is as valuable as silver or gold, but it's nice to be able to recycle it AND get a bit of money back.
4 out of 5 stars so far.

The new facility they have built is awesome.
Staff is great and they always have what I'm looking for, especially since my projects are not your typical hum drum things.

Why why why.
Does it take 25 minutes to go get and cut in half 400ft of barstock and im the only customer.
Ugh
