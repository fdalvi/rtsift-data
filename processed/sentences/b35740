Sleepy Wilson's BBQ catered my sons birthday party.
We had ribs, chicken wings, pulled pork, potato salad, macaroni & cheese and homemade lemonade.
Everyone commented on how great the food was because it is very authentic BBQ.
They had sauce on the side for the ribs and that was a big hit too.
I loved that they brought everything they needed to set up the food and that they made it look great.

Delicious food.
The Wilson burger and pulled pork sandwich are my favorites.

great little carry-out joint.
the food is amazingly awesome.
the chopped pork is sooo juicy and the ribs fall right off the bone.
i am soooo glad this place opened.
we usually go once a week to get our bbq fix.

So amazing, i love wings and prefer them spicy.
But these bbq wings were so good i almost ate the whole tray.
I don't live in lv, but i will be back!
This is a fast food location and worth the money.
Service is great, food is awesome...
Try them out and bring a friend!
Request the sweet potato fries :)
