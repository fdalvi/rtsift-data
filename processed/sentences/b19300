I've only ever had take-out from here, and I've always enjoyed the food.
It's good quality Chinese-Canadian food, and I've never been disappointed in a dish.
The Sesame chicken really does set this place apart though.
You have to try it.
My orders have always been filled quickly, and the service is pleasant.

Ming's isn't a fancy Chinese Restaurant, and it really doesn't try to be particularly authentic, but it does a good job of being the local takeout Chinese-Canadian place.
The takeout service is fast and friendly, and since it is close to my workplace it's pretty convenient too.
The last time I came, however, I tried to eat in, which was a bit of a mistake.
The portion was a bit smaller than usual and it took forever as takeout order after takeout order came before my eat in order...

This place has great Canadian-Chinese fast food.
The restaurant itself reminds me a bit of the Christmas Story where the family ends up at a Chinese restaurant on Christmas.
For this reason I eat in but for the most part I just get takeout.
Vegetable spring rolls are yummy, chicken fried rice and sweet and sour chicken balls are pretty good (good chicken to breading ratio) and General Tao chicken is great (spicy).
The sesame chicken is also super.
Although the place is steady with takeout orders the service and takeout timeframes are pretty good.
I like this place a lot.
