Really small overpriced candy store in The Mirage.
Kinna reminded me of Dylan's Candy Bar in NYC.
The signature candy they carry are these couture lollipops with refillable lollipop heads.
Many celebrities on the C and D-list endorse the lollipops like Kim Kardashian, Pussycat Dolls, and the cast of Scrubs.
The base of the lollipops are jewel encrusted so of course all the ladies love it.
It's located right by the doors off of the strip.
Kinna by CPK.

What Jeffrey L. fails to admit is that he was dyyiiinnnggg to visit the store because Jon Gosselin went here and he just has to be where Jon Gosselin goes.
Just kidding.
But on the real, it's hella small.
I walked in looking to purchase a perfectly round lollipop.
I even said it out loud and I didn't even know they had 'couture pops' which happen to be perfectly round.
I ended up not purchasing one because Jeffrey L. got it for me, he insisted.
What's nice is they can personalize a refill head kit, so you can get different heads if you want (that's what she said).
I like the watermelon and cherry the most.
Unfortunately, if you go on their website, you can only purchase a kit with the same flavors, but I think if you call they can personalize it.
Yeah, they're really overpriced, but if you're balling, like Jeffrey L. then it shouldn't be a problem.
They taste good and satisfy the needs of the orally fixated.
That's what she said.

I guess I was really impressed and just humored by this candy shoppe.
I love the name.
First of all, SUGAR says it all.
It is a store full of it.
Funny though, I noticed that they also sold drinks.
Coca Cola has distributed, to a small number of businesses, these tiny little Coke and DIet Coke beverages in tiny aluminum bottles.
The thing that made me laugh is that in a store called SUGAR that they'd even bother to sell the DIET COKE bottles.
And yes, Clarisse C., I'm one of those silly ones who has couture pops!!
They are perfectly round.
I love the Watermelon and Green Apple pops.
I was walking through that corridor and I noticed them.
I had to buy a few for my girlfriends.
They love them.
They are indeed some serious "luxe" pops.
The ones that I purchased were the stone/BLING encursted, celeb endorsed varieties.
Jeffrey L., what a sweet gesture it was for you to get one for Clarisse.
Anyways guys, there is all kinds of sweet stuff in here.
I have to admit, one thing that I didn't see was WATERMELON or RASPBERRY gummy bears.
THere is only one place in the world that I know of that carries those lil bears.
So, for that, four stars.
I guess I just thought a place like this, although very small, should kind of have it all.
ANyways, I liked the pops I bought.
One of the girls tried to work a deal with me but I think I ended up working a better one for myself.
HA!
True, you can get the refill pops online but luckily I visit so often that I think I can just buy them when I roll into vegas every other month or so.
One of the coolest things about their pops is that they can be covered if you're unable to devour them all at once.
It's nice.
You can carry it around with you in your purse or pocket even and not worry about everything around it getting sticky.
Nice ideas.
Steep prices.
Fun times.
It's vegas.
I expect to spend cash when I'm there.
I didn't mind.
It was a bunch of fun lil things that I bought from here.
Cool gift ideas.

I love my couture pop.
It's so pink and sparkly.
Love it.

Love the Sugar Factory, for one reason, Couture Pops.
I have two and plan to buy more, last time I was there I spent about 89 dollars.
Call me crazy but I think they are really cute, yes I am a guy, but a gay guy so it is ok to carry these around.
I am excited because a new one will be opening up at The Miracle Mile Shops in Planet Hollywood.
But I am even more excited for the new location at Paris Las Vegas which will include a restaurant, desserts such as gelato, and of course the merchandise and candy store.
Opens this fall.

Came here opening day.
The place wasn't officially open to the public and me and my friends kept coming back like little kids.
"Are you open yet?
Are you open yet?
" lol.
Well I had a gellato.
Yummy yummy mmm mmm.
I mixed the green apple with the caramel gellato.
OMG.
I had a baby.
The layout is cute.
The store itself is pretty small.
I like the pictures of celebreties that border the tops of the walls in the store.
The Britney Spears lollipop is the best one.
Oh and the chocolate cover sunflower seeds.
Who woulda thunk it?

The bling lollipop is $25 while the refills are $12 for 3.
Catchy concept but I don't see the value there.
Shop has other notables - sugar free selection and foot tall pez dispensers.

I went here after eating at Earl's and this was my first time going to Sugar.
I love the setup--nice and clean, white walls and loads of good candies from chocolates to lollies.
I wanted to buy their signature lollies and i did--the pussycat dolls lollipop and 2 refills of cherry and orange cream.
They serve gelato, which is great and the even have cute cupcakes for sale!
They serve their own drink mixes, teas, and coffee, so give it all a try at least once.
It's worth it.
I love being a kid in a candy store, and now there's a candy store for adults.
From candy bras to GIANORMOUS old-fashioned lollies and their signature lollipops, they have many things for any occassion.
Tip: they are open till 3am so stop by late at night and get your sugar fix!
Oh, and the signature lollipop collection runs $25 or more each and usually is great if you're going out clubbing or partying to show off.
I bought one.
Hell--you should get one at least once in your life!
Also, sample their gelato even if you don't have cash.
it's free and you can sample as much as you want, if you want.
Have fun yelpers!

Again.
I'm not a "sweet" kinda gal but, a co-worker told me to go with him to "SAMPS" a crepe and a milkshake.
So, I went with...
He got some Barbie milkshake and a banana/strawberry crepe.
GEEZ, talk about sweeeeeeeeeeet!
The girl behind the counter was really sweet (no pun intended) and patient with us and all our samples of gelato.
Overall, my friend was pleased with what he got...although he spent $15 for it.
Seriously?
$15 for a milkshake and crepe?
UHHH, ohhh-kaaay??!!
AND his crepe only had one banana and strawberry chunk.
PLEASE.
I suggest you go to Serendipity if you really need a good, semi-expensive, sugar fix.
Ohh, I almost forgot to mention their "couture pops.
" Basically a lollipop with an extremely expensive, reusable lolli-stick.
My friend got some to send to another friend back in Hawaii and each one is $25 a pop.
YES, $25 EACH....FOR A LOLLIPOP!!!
Sure, you can reuse the stick and attach a different flavor pop but, really???!
But, who am I to judge.
If you want it, GET IT.
If you have the money to burn, GET IT.
Shoot, get me one while you're at it =)

The Planet Hollywood location is bright, spacious, and cute with friendly and helpful staff.
There are so many goodies to choose from: candy, gelato, cupcakes, crepes, fudge, and milkshakes!
Everything looks soooo good and I seriously wouldn't mind trying a bit of everything.
The only thing I've had though are their couture lollipops.
They are a bit pricey but look how cute those sticks are!
You can mix and match sticks and lollipop flavors so whatever combo you don't see on the floor they can get for you in the back.
The sticks are reusable too so the next time you come in you can just get lollipop refills.
I'm so sad that my stick got accidentally thrown away, but I suppose it's okay since I don't think I would've really wanted to reuse the stick anyway.
The top was so sticky from all the licking!
The lollipop itself was tasty (I had watermelon) and lasted a long time.
They come with round lids so that you can save it for later - that's how long they can last so you do get some bang for your buck.

Ok, so I can't believe the new Sugar Factory has been open for a few months inside the Miracle Mile shops and I have not written a review.
Sugar Factory really stepped it up.
Not only can you buy the famous Couture Pops and other candy, you can now by gelato, milkshakes, and crepes.
My favorite milkshake is called the cookie jar and has oreo cookie crumbles, chocolate pieces and caramel mixed in.
So tasty and thick, they give you a thick straw to drink it.
My favorite crepe would have to be the bacon and swiss crepe.
Melted swiss on the inside, crumbled bacon on top, served with greens and a very tasty vinegarette dressing.
The staff is very friendly and always ready to educate you on Couture Pops in case you are not familiar.
Since my last review my collection, well combined with my boyfriend, of Couture pops has grown to 6 or 7.
I love them so much and I love the food and dessert additions.
I have yet to try the gelato.
So stop by Sugar Factory at the Miracle Mile Shops and see what all the buzz is about.

Candy store meets club.
Offspring is sweet yet a little wild.

HUH?
$25 for a lollipop?
I don' get it.
What's the allure?
Not like Brittany Spears or Kim Kardashian are paying that!
PLUS:  THIS COMPANY IS CANADIAN!!!

I had some time to kill before my flight left, so I decided to get some gelato.
It was good, but it was over $5 for a tiny little cup.
Not worth the $5, I guess I don't know the going rate for gelato, though!

I'm taking three stars off for the ridiculous couture pops.
Like, if I could take three stars off my rating of our SOCIETY OF NINCOMPOOPS THAT BUY THIS CRAP, I would do so.
I don't usually point to a luxury item and say, 'Imagine how many people you could feed for the price of this', but a rhinestone-encrusted lollipop holder crosses a line.
That such an item exists, fine, but the price point needs to be taken down a dark alley and shown a straight-to-DVD American Pie sequel.
That being said, I do like candy and gelato, which Sugar Factory does well.
I wish more of the items had listed prices because with the stupid couture pops priced at $25, who knows how supposedly trendy the rest of the stuff is.

I love this candy store, everything so cute and yummy.
The couture lollipop caught my eye.
The lollipop that has jewels on the stick which can be twist off the lollipop and a case for the lollipop if you can't finish the lollipop.
The limited edition celebrity is twenty five dollars and the non-limited edition is twenty bucks.
I got the Britney Spears edition which the jewels are pink and light blue and the favor of the lollipop is blueberry.
I just had to have one!

I had a cupcake from here.. it was 6-7 dollars.
total ripoff because it wasn't any good.
it was dry and the cake part didnt stick together.
I had a sandwich from the place across from the sugar factory and the sanwich was amazing and only 5.99.  honest opinion...I just think the sugar factory is really pretty and over hyped.
:\ nice on the eyes but not on the mouth.

I had 2 dips of cinnamon frozen yogurt.
It was excellent.
As others have mentioned, it's a bit pricey here.
I marked the place down because of the lack of value and the area where you eat.
Since the store is so small, the only tables are in the Miracle Mile Shops hallway, narrow in this section, and there are people walking by constantly.
Not even good people watching.
If I go back, I'll take the yogurt into the casino and sit at a machine where there's more room.

As a huge fan of sugar and all of her friends, I was super excited about the 15,000 square feet of sugar factory goodness at the Paris, but sadly they won't open until later this year so I had to make do with the one at Planet Hollywood.
However, I wasn't disappointed!
Greeted by old friends (Mary Janes and Uno's) and well as introduced to new friends (Couture Pops) I was in any sugar lover's paradise.
After picking up some treats to bring home, my husband and I tried the gelato (mojito for me and pineapple for him) we were amazed by how fresh the flavors were!
Service was also friendly and we were helped immediately.

Skip this shop all together.
The pricing is ridiculous and the candy I purchased (gummy coke bottles) was so stale I had to throw it away.
This establishment has pictures displayed all over town of celebs licking their suckers.
The true suckers are the shoppers paying a fortune for Walmart quality candy.
Save your money.

The candy here is way overpriced ($12.99 per pound), but I needed a sugar fix.
I'd gone a few days without chocolate so I happened to be walking around in The Mirage and wandered to this store.
I saw the Britney Spears couture pop advertised in the front and was steering clear of that section.
I got a tiny scoop of chocolate covered gummi bears and a few peach flavored gummi penguins.
This cost me $3.25 (1/4 lb).
Yikes.
The selection is the usual gummis that you could buy in a grocery/convenience store for 99 cents a bag.
They had a decent variety of chocolate covered items (pretzels, raisins, nuts, coffee beans).
Would not go back unless I needed chocolate to survive.
I did notice in the display case and in the back area of the store that they have bra and panty made of candy.
Perfect gift for a bachelorette.
Those were running $12-$20.

Expensive and small selection.
But if you a candy fiend like me, you'll pay anything for a fix.
This place is fine in a pinch and service is friendly.

Let's just get right to the point:  The selection was small and way over-priced.
This might be Vegas and you can probably get away with it but $13/lb?
Get real!
Everything was typical finds you can find at your local malls.
I still ended up buying a pound to get my chocolate fix while downing some vodka in the hotel room but I wasn't too impressed.,  For a place with The Pussycat Dolls endorsing it, I was expecting SO much  more.
Oh well.
I'd still go back if only to buy that cute shirt I saw.

First thing I asked in there, "do you guys go off the bartering system in here?
" They are selling candy, not artwork.
They should get rid of their some of their floor sales associates.
Then lower the prices a little bit since they would reduce payroll and put up prices on their candy.
Why should I have to ask someone how much is a jawbreaker or cupcake?
It's candy.
Don't think for a second that this candy is so good that anyone is willing to pay any price for it.
If the reason for not putting up prices is because they are high and people will be discouraged when they see them, then have reasonable pricing.
Have they lost their minds?
It's candy.
CAN-DY.
Asking for prices makes it a hassle type experience because of all the different inventory as opposed to an art gallery where people deal in thousands of dollars and pricing is negotiated.
If they want more business and to not come across as arrogant, then fix your business model.
Definitely not built for long term success.
I would have gave this no-stars if it allowed cause I walked out of there with anger over the ridiculousness and pondered what this world is coming to.

came here last summer and i was so excited to visit!!
this place reminded me of sweet factory in sf (but they closed it down couple years ago).
when i got here i was a bit disappointed because they did not have a big selection of sweets.
but i did like how they had those candy jars and boxes to put your candies in.
it was a bit overpriced but hey!
i'm on vacation.
it'll be souvenirs and i can reuse it at home anytime i want to.
haha.

i'm torn with this review.
The candy quality and selection is MINIMAL...I've seen better at a candy store at the mall...but I ordered the red velvet sundae and that was HEAVEN:  red velvet cake, frosting, ice cream, whip cream, and chocoalte and caramel sauce?
I died...I seriously ate almost the whole thing!!

So the atmosphere was great!
I loved the service too!
everything looked great to me until I saw some of the stupidest prices ever for lollipops.
The macaroons were pretty well made but didn't taste that good to me.
too hard and too over baked.
Being a candy store, it wasn't all that to me as a I walked around.
I wouldn't come back, but pretty decent experience!

I think Sugar Factory target customers are people who smoke cracks.
I don't care if my lollipops are design by celebrities.
I do care about how much I'm going to pay for it.
$25 for celebrities lollipop and $22 for standard lollipop = insanity.
It's not going to happen.

I love this place because you have so many options.
Restaurant: Adorable romantic/trendy atmosphere.
Drinks are strong, Cinnamon Toasted Crunch Martini is delicious.
The deep-fried Mac and Cheese balls were good but overpriced.
Besides the fact they were fried, it was nothing special.
The Ahi Tuna sliders were pretty good.
The Nutter Butter shake was INSANE!
I'd go back just for this 1ft tall glass of deliciousness.
Chocolate Bar:  Overpriced, buy the truffles at the candy shop.
The chocolate bar charges $2 a truffle, the Candy Store charges by the lb (~$0.87 a piece)  Candy Bar:   Some shirts were cute, they run VERY small.
I generally wear a M, but here I'm an XL.
Truffles melt in your mouth and taste good, but not great.
Vanilla Macaron is just sugary sweet.
Raspberry Macaron is soooo Good!
Chocolate one is pretty good but more sweet than chocolaty.

Fun souvenir from Vegas!
I got the Kim Kardashian sucker stem and the green apple sucker.
I am going to be staying at the Paris next week so I will try another flavor.
Fun but pricey little suckers!

Came here after eating at Earl of Sandwich and boy did this place suck!
It fools you cuz everything looks so delectable and so cute!
After walking around a bit I set my eye on ice cream.
Yum right?
Wrong!
I sampled two of their flavors and it was so bad I didn't even finish my samples... Too sugary not creamy and just unpleasant overall.
After deciding against the ice cream I finally settled on their red velvet cupcake.
My boyfriend came back with some chocolate covered peanuts and some peanut butter m&ms.
The pb m&ms were the only good thing, and they didn't even make them.
The red velvet cupcake was pretty awful.
The frosting did not taste like cream cheese, just tons of sugar and no other flavor to balance.
The cake itself was too dense but hard and not moist the way you want cupcakes to be.
And the chocolate covered peanuts?
Tasted the way chocolate does when it's way too old -crumbly and dry.
Gross

Fun to visit every time in Vegas.
Smack in the middle of the strip, a beautiful colorful display, nice employees that will give you a sample of anything, a 5 lb gummy bear...  Haven't eaten in the sit down area before, but I like to come and browse.

Lets begin with I was already one shot in when we arrived so my sweet tooth kicked it.
Didn't help that everything in the front looks absolutely delish!
Everything is so colorful and pretty.
Darn you over priced sugar factory you've suckered us in!
We went with the ice cream and red velvet brownie..
Lets start with the brownie is WAY to sweet, we both took one bite and then had to throw it away.
The cream cheese didnt taste like cream cheese frosting.
It didnt taste like a brownie either.
it was as if they put velvet cake on a chocolate brownie.
what a waste.
sugar over load!
yuck!
It looked better than it tasted.
The ice cream was good but i've had better.. Tiff got the cream brulee and my mouth watered for the hazelnutt chocolate.
Lets say that I like the Thrifty's down the street better.. both were just okay, not worth the price.
All 3 items cost 28 bucks... RIP OFF!

Definitely never coming back, For starters, the atmosphere was completely uncomfortable and the service was extremely slow.
The music was so loud I couldn't even have a conversation with my boyfriend who was sitting directly across from me.
The tables were pushed together really close.
It almost felt as if I was eating in a cafeteria.
The food was also extremely bland.
I got the New York Steak and it was probably one of the worst steaks I have ever had.
Our waitress was friendly but in general the service was extremely slow... by the end of the meal, we skipped dessert because we were so eager to leave.
This meal was not worth what we paid.

Very cute place!

This place is very adorable and if you like sweets you will probably be tempted to go in and try it.
We ordered a candy cocktail which was not bad.
The food was not good unfortunately.
I ordered a crepe with chicken which arrived cold.
They remade another which was hot... but there was a major lack of any chicken.
About 3 tiny pieces!
I hardly ate any of it, so they took it off the bill.
But it was frustrating to go somewhere for dinner and leave without having any dinner!
It's a very gimicky place based on decor and celebrity ad's.
We didn't try the desserts or candy.
There are so many great restaurants in Vegas, so I am not happy we picked this one over many others.
I hope they improve the quality of their food!

TONS of things to choose from.
I was offered help and greeted and the stuff was pleasant.
I got one of their chocolate covered apples and really wasn't a fan.
I believe it was the Butterfinger.
Also, I ended up buying it from the main counter instead of the counter they sell them at because I stood for about five minutes and the three girls behind that counter talked and often looked over at me standing at the register but didn't offer to help.
I went back to have my apple cut, hoping for the best.
A new girl was behind the counter and help me right away with a smile.
The inside is beautiful.
Just like any candy store should be.
It suckers you in!
Pretty pink candies everywhere calling your name in every direction.
Yum!
I didn't think it was unreasonably priced considering the hype, though definitely more expensive than your neighborhood candy store.

What an interesting selection of chocolate covered strawberries!
I love the variety of chocolates and sprinkles that they have on their large chocolate covered strawberries.
YUM!
So after having a few of these yummy strawberries I had to stop by the actual store on the strip.
It was REALLY crowded.
The only thing that I was craving was ice cream and they had gelato.
While the mango gelato was very good, they didn't have many fruit flavors but they had quite a few cookie and candy flavors.
I'm sure this is a tourist trap and the prices for candy is outrageous.
But then again, isn't that the theme on the strip?

Vincent: Jules, would you pay $6.95 for 1 single red velvet cupcake?
Jules: Well, we'd have to be talkin' about one charming motherfucking red velvet cupcake.
I mean, it'd have to be ten times more tasty than that Nothing Bundt Cakes or even some gourmet homemade shit, you know what I'm saying?

Sugar Factory!!
I went to last vegas last year to go to SEMA with my Hubby, and as I was looking for places to shop in the miracle mile shop, I stumbled on this super cute candy store.
Their specailty is I guess those couture lollipop, they are so cute but they are expensive, the price ranges from 22-30 per lollipop and they offer bundles that ranges from 30-80 so yah it is really expensive for a lolipop but hey if you're  the type of person that can splurge money on casionos and shows then maybe you'd want to get some of these cutesy lolipops  Ambiance: very tourisy and cute Price: $$ moderate but still really expensive for just a lolipop Service: is ok, there is so much people in this store almost all the time that the associates can't attend to all of them, but it was not a big deal for me.
Warning!!!!
place can get really crowded.
So expect a line and a ton of kids and teens   As of me I give Sugar Factory 4 stars because I am a fan of their lolipop flavors and their super cute couture handles ^__^

okay, i dont get what the employees' problems are here but i felt as if i was a big bad criminal about to steal overpriced lollipops & candy.
NOT!!!
i dont even have a big sweet tooth to begin with!
my bf and i were walking down the strip and decided, "hey why not stop in here for a bit?
" so we did, but once we got in we were greeted..which yes i totally get it, customer service all the guests...yes yes yes.
but i dont know about being stopped literally 10 times and being followed around the store even after i said "we're just looking around..thank you...etc"  thats my biggest pet peeve of any store i go to is being bombarded like that and its like they thought i was going to steal something.... i was getting frustrated because i really did want to check everything out peacefully...i couldnt.
i was about to leave until i saw a hello kitty pez and i got all giddy (b/c yes  i do love H.K.
since i was a wee little girl not like i join the fad out of nowhere)...my bf decided to grab one and buy it for me..but then AGAIN we got stopped -__________-  overall, everything or should i say..the very FEW things i got see were definitely overpriced...esp theyre arts and crafts/overly priced lollipops of course.
i wouldnt come here again just because i dont want to walk in a store and automatically feel like i dont belong there or im going to steal your precious lollipops.
puhhh-lease!

I went in there with the intent to buy a Hello Kitty lolli because I'm a freak and love HK.
I was ambushed by a very flamboyant worker there, who would NOT stop asking questions and pressuring me into buying $75 worth of lollipops and refills.
I have nothing against him, but dude, seriously, in not the only costumer in there, BACK OFF.
Pushy, stalking workers are a TOTAL turn off!
Once I picked out my lolli, he had to ring me up, and he gave me SUCH attitude when he said "so this is ALL for you?
" yeah, thanks to you, it is.
Enjoy the commission.
P.s.
I got cherry and I just opened it last night to eat some of it...it's fucking nasty.
It tastes straight up like plastic.
For $25, a chupa chups taste like fucking ambrosia in comparison.
I should have left it for looking purposes only.
Oh well, at least it comes with a protective case.
I don't regret buying it, I just regret opening it...

One of my favorite moments occurred at the Sugar Factory the day after St. Pattie's Day.
I ordered a twinkie drink.
Now, before you go thinking what the hell girlie man, there are seven shots of alcohol in it, and you get a twinkie on the top, and the thing tastes just like a twinkie!
Then I blacked out.

I am giving it 3 stars because of the attitude and nasty looks I got from the employees inside the store.
The girl helping me decide what Lolly Case and flavor I wanted was nice but the girl at the register was a Nasty Bitch with Attitude to boot!
If it wasn't for the great service I got at the bar from Caysee I would not return to this place again.
Caysee our Bartender was a delight and fun.
My Swedish Fish cocktail was YUMMY and the blow pop Martini was good with it's Pop Rocks on the rim.
Caysee made this place and need more employees like her.
Hope the owners from the Sugar Factory read this and fire the girl at the register and hire a Happy person who likes there job.

I am only reviewing one item, as that was the only thing I bought, because they are my all time favorite and must try them where ever I go and see them.
The French Macrons, were dry, tasted like they had been placed out there over over until they were all gone.
I will be going back to try some other items because I don't want my review to be based on something they don't have on there standard menu.

I went in with my wife for breakfast...
I figured its called the sugar factory lets try something sweet.
I ordered Nutella Choc Chip Pancakes with Dark Choc Drizzle.
I never tried this so i wasnt sure how it would turn out.
I got the HARDEST pacakes ever made....
I was so confused and asked the Bus Boy, are these suppossed to be Hard because of the chocolate ?
(dumbfounded) He responded are they hard?
I took my knife and tried to cut a peice and i was Jamming my knife into it without nothing happening... he saw i was not exagerating...
The Bus Boy that works there, said.... OMG i hate this place, i have no clue why famous people come here, this place blows....
Took my pancakes and said, i will go complain for you...
I was literally so confused thinking, should they be this hard ?
30 Mins had already passed by and but this time i said let me just get a side order of Home fries, that should already be made correct?
I dont want to wait longer for another order of pancakes.... 15 mins later, a side of pancakes comes out anyway...
This time not Crispy hard, But rubbery soft...
I took make 3 bites and just left it there...  THEN my order of home fries comes out... who the hell eats home fries with choc pancakes ?
I already cancelled the pancakes just to eat the home fries and you bring them out anyway.... then serve the home fries too... huh ?
The bus boy came back later and asked us, How did you hear about this place?
did you see a review or something...  No we just passed by.
Well i dont know why famous people come here, this place sucks !!!
I said, yeah now we know and wont make that mistake again....

Sugar free candy is a joy to find, especially in a store like this one.
I don't need sugar free candy for myself, but I look for it wherever I go because a few of my favorite people do need sugar free goodies.
I love to buy gifts for my friends, so it makes me very happy to find such a nice selection in a sugar loving candy store.
I ignored the overpriced lollipops and the pushy salespeople.
I simply collected the candy that I wanted and approached the counter.
It was only once I was at the counter that the cashier pointed out a few sugar free goodies that I had missed.
I appreciated the tip, and even bought a few pieces of the newly discovered candy.
Nice!
This was a happy stop for me during my trip to Vegas.
I spent far too much on candy that was no different than the candy that I can buy almost anywhere, but I left with the knowledge that I had found an almost healthy snack in this land of gluttony.

Love love love the pannacotta in a waffle cone!!
Kelly is the sweetest employee here!
She deserves a raise!!

I don't know about the attitude reviewers are complaining about, because I was already a bit tipsy.
What I do know, is that oreo cake pop was insanely delicious, and I like my little box of mints.
If you need a sweet fix, stop in.
If you don't, skip it.

Sunny, our waitress, totally rocks and was friggen awesome.
The smores crepe, yum, and the 35 dollar martini smoky glass dry ice thing, YUM, and the ambience was lovely.
Candle lit and fun.
However, if you try to walk to the bathroom while people are in line for Chateau night club upstairs, good luck.

I decided to stop in and see if there was a sugary goodie for me.
I was approached immediately by a worker who came on a bit too strong.
I told him I was interested in looking at a pastry and he said OK I will box that right up for you.
I mean HELLO I didn't even say I wanted what he was boxing up nor new what the heck he was boxing up.
When I asked him he said it was a 'Red Velvet Cupcake" and so I thought well ok that sounds tasty.
Then he rings me up and it was $6.95 for a single cupcake?!?!
Really?!?!?!
I didn't want to pay for it but was caught off guard and just decided to go ahead with it but was kind of nervous about telling my hubby after I walked out about what I had just paid for 1 single cupcake.
I did tell him and he said I deserved the treat and that I had always been wanting to try it so not to feel guilty.
When I got home I had this cupcake for dessert and it was just okay.
The cupcake was a bit dry.
The cream cheese frosting was good but tasted like any old Betty Crocker frosting from a can.
I will probably try a different location next time if I do stop in and hope I can be given the time to peruse and decide what I want and know what I am paying before hand.

Friendly and quick service.
Expensive candy though.
But makes for great gifts.

During my most recent Vegas trip, I came to the Sugar Factory for a drink.
I ordered the following drinks: blow pop martini, jolly rancher Both drinks are delicious, but I do warn you that they are extremely sweet.
The drinks were $16/each, which I think was a bit overpriced but it's expected because it is Las Vegas after all.
The Sugar Factory Store is filled with crazy overpriced candy and junk!
It's totally insane to pay that kind of money, however, I do admit they have a lot of cute non-sense things in their store.
If you were balling out of control and had a lot of money to throw around on junk, then by all means .
live it up!

No Vegas trip is complete without a stumble to the Sugar Factory for a drink or two...or five.
I haven't actually tried the food, so this review pertains solely to the drinks.
After hearing my girlfriend rave about this place for months, I decided to give it a try on a trip to Vegas.
I must admit, I had pretty high standards after hearing about how impeccable their drinks are.
I'm sure glad that I listened to her.
The key to maximizing your experience is to go during Happy Hour (I think 3-6 PM?
) since all drinks are 2 for 1.
Most drinks will run you about $14, so getting the benefit of this deal is pretty crucial.
I've tried a lot of the drinks on the menu, but a few in particular stand out: S'Mores Martini, Golden Graham Martini, and the White Chocolate Martini.
No matter what you choose, you really can't go wrong.
Relative to Vegas pricing standards, these drinks will give you bang for your buck.
Also, it's like eating dessert at the same time.
Pretty sweet!
Great place to spend a few hours in the afternoon with your friends.
Nice ambiance in the restaurant, friendly service, and the location is easily accessible(right in the middle of the Vegas strip).
The drinks do take a little while to come out, so make sure you're not in a rush to get somewhere.

Exquisite drinks.
Up until this point I had never thought that making drinks could be an art in itself.
Silly me.
Since I've heard their food menu is questionable, I've never tried it.
Thus, this review is for the DRINKS seulement.
I've seen the ingredients they've used to make the drink menu here, and it's all high quality, each concoction made with care.
The skills that go into each item is apparent in the fact that they put in quite a bit of alcohol in each (about three shots of liquor per average sized drink) and somehow they play in the taste of the alcohol and turn it into an actual flavor you enjoy.
Note, the alcohol flavor isn't masked, only mused with in a way that benefits the overall palate.
If it's your first time there, try the "Sexual Chocolate.
" Thank me later :)

My last visit to the Sugar Factory was a bit disappointing.
We called in advance to make sure that the Happy Hour special (2 for 1) was still going on.
The employee stated that it was in effect from 4-8 PM.
When we arrived, the bartender notified us that Happy Hour was not being offered.
Inconsistency is not cool.
Also, I noticed that a number of the cocktail drinks (e.g.
Swedish fish cocktail) were taken off of the menu.
There are only about 5 options left to choose from.
Realistically, the Sexual Chocolate is the only one worth ordering...
I'll give Sugar Factory another chance to redeem itself.

overpriced over-the-counter candy.
also, my daughter saw the hello kitty pre-packaged candy (she's 2 years old) and started fiddling with the containers.
not banging around, not throwing.
she would take them out of the box then put them back in.
yes, it's probably mildly annoying.
but she's 2, and it IS a candy store.
employee came and reprimanded her.

Good Gelato, open 24 hours...lots of sweet indulgences :)

5 stars for the super nice associate, but I was disappointed with the candy.
For a candy store, I was super surprised at how bad the chocolate was.
You can tell that it's not real chocolate.. it's most definitely artificially flavored chocolate.
I love chocolate covered raisins and almonds but I couldn't eat them.
Yes, I understand it's not a chocolatier, but C'mon..
I'm not picky.
It tasted like Palmer's chocolate.

I thought it was really cute and had pretty good candy!
What else can you expect?

Not the best service and felt it was overpriced for what you got.
Went to dinner on a week night before Jersey Boys and the place wasn't crowded.
I honestly didn't know if we'd make the show as everything from drinks to the food was super slow.
Our waitress took our order and then we didn't see her again until she dropped off the check.
No second drinks.. No how was your food...nothing.
I can honestly deal with subpar service is the food is worth it.
It's not!
I had a pizza which was under done and bland and my husband had a salad that had way too much dressing and barely any toppings.
We didn't order dessert - not that we were asked - so maybe we missed the best part.
With all the other choices in Vegas don't waste your time.

The Sugar Factory is known for it's delicious drinks and some of the worst service in town.
Seriously, I've had a problem with the Sugar Factory on the strip with customer service, and after visiting this location for the first time the other day, my hopes of better service crumbled, it's even worse here.
While the hostess was great and quick about seating us, we sat there for about 12 minutes before anyone even came over.
Not only was the waitress slow, she seemed confused as to what tables she was suppose to be waiting.
A moment after she left, another waiter came to take our order once again, and was confused that we had ordered with someone else already.
I usually get the veggie burger from Sugar Factory, not only is it really the only acceptable vegetarian dish on the menu, it's just delicious.
I don't know whether they changed the recipe or the chef is an idiot, but the once signature purple bun was replaced with a regular white bun.
Bummer.
:(  Finishing touch to our horrible experience, the bartender that brought us our drinks was a complete bitch.
We sat by the bar so I could see what they were doing.
She was chatting with another bartender and seemed irritated that she had to work, you know, do her job, and make drinks.
When she brought over the drinks you could tell she was in such a pissy mood because she couldn't concentrate enough to hold the drinks steady, she spilled a good portion of mine all over her hand and slammed the drinks on the table (further spilling my Cherry Pop drink) So now I have a drink with 1/2" of it spilled all over the table and she stomps off without an apology or cleaning up her mess.
Also, sticking the cherry tootsie pop in the drink is a great idea and all.
But it would be better if they took the wrapper off and put the sucker in handle-up.More pleasant to hold and no one has to peel the wet paper off the candy.
As good as their sugary sweets are, the service and prices are enough to sour our mood.
Stay away.
FARRRR AWAYYYYYYY

If I could cuss on here and not have my review erased by a moderator I would.
This place is over priced.
The famous bedazzled lollipops are defective and the refills don't fit.
Tried to bring it back for my daughter and they wanted a receipt.
I just wanted them to exchange it for a local 11 yr old without driving back to summerlin and looking for the receipt.
This place has ridiculous prices on everything.

Wow this place sucks.
Girlfriend got sick and the food was way overpriced.
Staff was nice until they realized how disapointed we were with the purple burger buns and nasty wiped avacado mayo and ignored us, probably because they recommended the meal we got.
I think they realize how much their lives suck working a horrible sugar factory location that just poisons and robs customers.
