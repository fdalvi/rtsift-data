I'm not gonna comment on any of the food here but the service at this location is always fast and efficient.
This is the nearest KFC to me since the one on Centennial closed down a little whille ago.
I'm definetly not ashamed to say I loves me some KFC.

They have good specials!
$10 for a 10-piece any way you want it & $22.99 with 3 large sides.
I gave them less stars because of the 20-minute wait to get grilled ones.

Friendly cashiers that will greet you and take your order quickly, however, the food took a little while to come out (maybe 10-12 min) but the chicken was fresh, juicy and steaming hot when I received it and that never happens at KFC or most fast food places for that matter!
It was definitely worth the wait, especially because the batter was extra crispy and tasty!
The parking lot seemed a little dark so be careful when coming here at night.
Other than that, there was plenty of parking, but they have a drive thru if you don't feel like parking.

Their original and grilled chicken are regular favorites in our house.
It seems to be popular with everyone else, too, as I often have to wait an extra 10 minutes while they cook another batch.
The staff is always friendly and efficient.
The location is convenient, too.

Every time that I have attempted to order here I have been told that they are out of chicken breasts for the day!
Are you kidding me?
Close this place down!
