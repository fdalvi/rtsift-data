Really nice hookah lounge, good hookah, good not loud music, friendly atmosphere, I recommend to come here

Excellent place!
Great hookah and food and DJ!
The owner is super nice!
Friendly atmosphere!

This place is one of my favorite little hidden gems!
It's got a very laid back atmosphere with good music.
It's nice because you can actually carry a conversation with someone without having to yell over the music like at The Olive.
We come here weekly and always get the "crack tea" which is this delicious Egyptian tea and a "sweet spot" (I'll let you find out what that is when you try it!
) I also recommend the hummus , it's very authentic.
Also the hookahs here hit exceptionally well, they are very clean and have an ice chamber below the bowl so you always get a smooth hit.
I also like that there are many comfortable couches and places to sit.
The coffee shop vibe makes this my favorite hookah spot!
And an additional plus is that the owner is very personable !

This place is perfect.
The food, the flavors, the atmosphere, and the staff all blend together to form a hidden oasis of what you can call a hookah lounge.
The hookah is amazing.
The food is good  Has a relaxed, layback atmosphere.
The perfect place to come and relax and smoke I highly recommend coming here.
