Part of the City Art Centre this is unfortunately not as good as the attraction it services.
A fairly soul-less though bright enough high-ceilinged room, at Â£6 their cooked breakfast is not good value & you'll definitely find better for less elsewhere.

When I have to work in the town, I often meet a friend for lunch here.
I like the large space and decor.
They have a good selection of vegetarian options which my friend really appreciates and its not pricey.
My favourite is their great big bowls of soup of the day.
The bowls are enormous and it comes with nice granary bread.
The have a large selection of traybakes and fancies, which you can get to go if you don't have enough time for a leisurely lunch.
Good kids menu too.
