I just moved here from Illinois and looking for a new hair salon has been hard.
I found Essentials on yelp and I am very pleased with my cut.
Jen listened to what I wanted.
Thanx Jen, great job.
I will be back and bring my 3 girls for hair cuts.

my wife and I have been going to Essentials for quite a while now.
We love the place.
the staff are great and oh, the hair cuts are too!

I'm new to the Madison area and thought my search for the perfect cut and highlight would be a long process, as usual.
I got it right on the first try!
Jen at essentials was fantastic.
She seemed to get what I wanted right away, and I walked out with perfect highlights and a great cut.
I'll definitely be back again and again!

I love Essentials.
Holly has been cutting my hair and she does a great job, listens to what I ask for and is so friendly.
It's a small salon, but it is really nice and you can tell they love what they do!

Called 10:30 am left a message, called several times during the still no answer.
Finally got a call back at 4:15.
Then said they might be able to get me in in 13 days?This is not customer service.

I've gotten my hair cut here for the past year or so.
Jen does a solid job and is super nice - she even taught me how to style my hair.
