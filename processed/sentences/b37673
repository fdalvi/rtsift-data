Just want to send a shout out for NVP Autowerks.
We recently had to take our Ford 250 Diesel in for repair.
It had a hard start when the truck was cold.
Riley (the mechanic) diagnosed the issue first thing in the morning, and to our surprise, it wasn't even the problem we expected.
It turned out to be the Fuel Control Module.
That said, we were offered 3 different options for repair (solder old part, replace with Ford Part, replace with BETTER after market part).
We chose to replace the part, and Riley had it ordered and installed within 1.5 days.
It's run like a charm ever since.
We were particularly surprised when Riley did a follow-up call just to ensure everything was running fine.
Excellent customer service!!
Our Ford is really starting to get broken in, and hence, we have more repairs ahead of us.
We will definitely be going back to NVP!

These guys are great!
Take good care of my 2002 Ford Exploder and don't treat me like a girl :-)  Go see them

Brought my son's Civic in for service.
They had it in & out the same day!
Very cool guys- Super HAPPY!!
Thanks so much!

I can't express enough how grateful I am that I found NVP Autowerks.
After taking my car to 3 national chain autoshops where I was told "this & that" was wrong and it will be a bajillion dollars to fix it, I found NVP Autowerks and they discovered what I was told originally needed repaired didn't need repaired at all!
(other things did need repaired, but not the items I had been told by the other shops) And NVP didn't charge me a bajillion dollars for the repairs!
They charged a very fair & reasonable price and provided me a level of trust I have not had in years, if ever, with a mechanic.
They have gone above and beyond to help me with the issues my '02 BMW X5 has been experiencing but most importantly, they stand firmly behind their work .
