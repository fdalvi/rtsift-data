Vintage by Misty is the best vintage store in the Valley and beyond!
We have followed her from Downtown to Scottsdale Central.
In the photo we are showing a very cool presentation of Alexander McQueen.
A great variety of designer clothing, jewelry and accessories at reasonable prices.

Love love love love this place!
Found it today and I'm still obsessing over the amazing finds in this beautiful boutique and planning my next stop in!
Everything is hand picked and one of a kind!
The owners are so friendly and outgoing and welcoming!
If you are looking for real vintage finds like chanel, Dior, Hermes, ect look no further!

Beautiful vintage clothing accessories sourced from Israel and other European countries.
The items here are unique and eye-catching and with that comes a fancy price tag.
Service here is excellent.
If you love genuine vintage items this is a must see while in Scottsdale.

This rating is based off not going inside.
It said open on yelp and sadly it's closed on Sundays.
So sad the store looks amazing.
I'll have to come back next time  in Arizona
