This is one of my favorite Starbucks locations.
The baristas are always sweet and friendly.
And patient.
Twice I've come in wanting to try something new, and they have recommended new drinks for me to try.
One, I didn't care for and they tossed it for me and made me my normal frappuccino that I love for free.

Love this location.
Friendly staff.

Great location.
Easy to find and tons of parking.
Super nice and friendly employees.
This location is quite small inside but there is still a decent amount of seating inside.
There is also some seating outside but not a lot.
Fast service which I look for in Starbucks.
Good food choices, they don't have everything though.
Free wifi which is a plus.
Clean and fresh looking bathroom.
Overall this Starbucks was definitely a nice one and I had a pleasant visit with no disruptions to make it bad.
