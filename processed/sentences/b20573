This place seems to me to be Stockbridge's answer to Marchmont's Peter Green's.
I say this because I saw pretty much exactly the same stock in here as in Peter Green's.
Except that Peter Green's is larger and the men are more charming.
No offense meant.
Prices are also about the same as Peter Green's.
They have a healthy (and by healthy I mean unhealthy) selection of ales and wines.
Which is pretty much the only reason I'd go in there.
Ales.
And wines.
Especially ales.
It's a very cozy little shop, with everything beautifully displayed.
Very organized.
Possibly even a bit too organized for my taste.
Though I'm already getting over it.
And the staff are always willing to help (I seem to think most staff are willing to help, but maybe I just know how to approach them).
Definitely get yourself to this shop if you're in the area and treat yourself to some boozy goodies.

This place is very very very small, so when you come here, don't be like me and try to cart around a bag of various tasty delights because if there are more than about 4 people in here, you will probably knock something over.
However, this place uses every inch of available space and fills it with lovely wines and beers and just about anything you might like to drink on a relaxed evening in.
When I came here with The man a few months ago we opted for two wines which were under a tenner (probably around the £6 to £8 mark) and they were both incredibly nice.
I've never before just walked into a wine shop, selected reasonably two priced wines, and had both turn out just perfect.
I'm sure our excellent wine choice is colouring me on this place a bit and unfortunately I've not been back since so I don't know if we just got really lucky, but I think it's a very good buyer who finds wines that nice for that price.
