Horrible preschool.
Teachers are lazy and the kids do not learn much.
We pulled our son out this year.
We realize now why they lost so many kids last year.
School has bad leadership and fired teachers because of low enrollment.

I've sent 3 children through the Pre-school at Har Zion and have never been more satisfied with a preschool.
One of my children is still in school there and she comes home every day extremely happy.
The teachers are the most compassionate people and truly care about the children.
I never have to worry that my child isn't being well taken care of.
And the Director is the best in the business.
Ask anyone is the Phoenix/Scottsdale jewish community and they will know exactly who she is and how amazing she is at her job.
If you are dissatisfied with your experience at this school it is for personal reasons that have nothing to do with the quality of the staff or the education the children receive.

My husband and I were married at Har Zion in 2003, when the membership was flourishing.
Today, their membership is really low, and not many young families are members.
It would be great if younger families at least attended services.
Babysitting is available the first and third Shabbat morning.
My son and I attend fairly regularly.
They are the only synagogue in the area that offers daily minyans twice daily.. More people need to be present for that though.
Please help by attending minyan  at least once a month.
Hopefully the incoming new rabbi will help bring in younger, newer members to help grow this synagogue.
