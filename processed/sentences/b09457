Thought this place was wonderful when we first looked at the place, spacious, great kitchen and living area.
Well our fridge leaked and always got our food, our AC leaked and we FINALLY got a new unit outside the apartment but did that fix the problem?
No.
Maybe we got a bad apartment but still it was a headache.
The complex is right down the street from a not so good part of town, dont believe me?
?look up on the Police website of the crime that has happened recently, almost all are Auto Theft related..and I have a locking gas cap on my car now because of the fact that I would get up to go to work and i'd start my car and what did you know...in my window for my speedometer read the message "gascap"  so i took a look at it and BOOM  there was my gas cap hanging by the string as soon as i opened the flap along with HALF my tank missing.
Good if you like tennis courts and being right down the street from AZ Mills mall.

I have had no problems with this place, every time something needs to be fixed its done promptly.
Its a little bit pricier but if you take advantage of all the complex has to offer then its worth it.
Great pool, nice racketball courts, tanning beds and a good gym.

We've been living here a year.
Our neighbors have slashed tires in the parking lot, there have been multiple domestic disputes with other neighbors where cops have shown up, the complex does nothing about it.
There is an abandoned upscale vehicle that has been in the same parked spot for 8 months.
The spa was broken for 6 months when we first moved here.
Our AC has been broken a few times this summer.
We called the emergency maintenance request line and no one responded.
Why set up a line and call it emergency!
We had to buy a hotel room because our place was unlivable with the AC out.
Save yourself the cost of a hotel room and rent.
Move to another complex!
