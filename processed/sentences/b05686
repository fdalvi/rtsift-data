The worst attorney ever, I hired Mr. Scalia back around 1997, paid his attorney fees up front, when it was time for family court he never showed up, He sent his partner or secretary I never even met,  and I lost the case, I was so upset Because my ex lied in court and they did absolutely nothing about it!
I called his office and left a message, asking why he didn't show up, he called me back and stated I was crazy and psycho for being so mad, Maybe because he already had his money, Never pay full upfront!
Also another court date he never showed up And the other attorney representing my ex said if I were you I'd hire another attorney.
I did!!!
This is 2013 now hopefully he is better!

Mr. Scalia is a very aggressive attorney.
He was able to get my cases resolved very quickly and the price was very reasonable.
The staff is helpful and friendly.
I could easily have given five stars but there was no parking, a lot of construction in the area causing a delay arriving.
I would definitely use Mr. Scalia again.

I've used Mr. Scalia's firm for years and have always had excellent results.
He is very straight forward and his prices are reasonable.
I have recommended him to a lot of my friends and they are all happy with his service.
