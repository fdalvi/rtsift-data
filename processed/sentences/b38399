So my friend has been telling me about this place & I gotta say I'm so glad I came along.
I found some cool things for my daughter at a fraction of the normal price but for me I totally scored!
Lucky jeans & buckle jeans for ridiculously cheap.
I bought them out of my size!
So get this....
They bring in stuff thats embroidered- back packs, lunch pails, bags, etc..... & sell them at a really low price.
Easy for you to buy this stuff and just remove the name & save a TON.
I'm afraid to go back because I will buy more stuff than I need, yeah its that good!

Raving fan!
The assistant manager Lia and store manager Susan Darner helped me surprise my wife and made me look like super husband!
Thank you guys for making our first baby experience awesome!

We had a terrible experience with customer service.
While looking at the jewelry, an associate informed us that it was 30% off and the clearance clothes were an extra 50% off the ticket.
Enticed by this, we shopped the clearance and found two dresses.
At the register, the dresses didn't ring up correctly.
I told her they were clearance items and should be 50% off.
An assistant manager was there at the counter and said that wasn't the case.
I told her what the associate said and she basically told me I was lying and that her associates would never say that.
I asked for her manager, whose name was Nola, and she told me that she overheard what the sales girl said to me and that I was lying.
I was surprised that she would've overheard the conversation and remembered it from 45 min ago.
I asked her to honor what the associate said and she told me no.
Then, I asked for the customer service number or number to a general manger and she told me to go online.
She finished by saying, "they will just forward your complaint to me anyway".
I was appalled at her reaction!
