The showed up when they said they would.
Very professional.
They checked our AC/Heat pump to make sure it was in working order for the winter.
Would do business with again.

I've been using Bishop Air for more than 10 years, and they've kept my 16-year-old A/C unit humming with yearly maintenance calls.
The guy I always request is Garlen: he is super-conscientious and does a great job cleaning the coils and getting debris off the unit outdoors.
He checks everything and doesn't try to create problems or tell me to replace parts unnecessarily.
I recommend Bishop Air highly.

Super honest and I really trust them to do 100%!
Highly recommend.

I would give them a zero if I could.
The owner was rude and unhelpful when I tried to narrow down when the tech would be there.
I have tenants freezing in my rental property and she could care less.
She said between 12-3 and I called to see when at 2:00 when nobody had showed.
I asked if she could call the tech and if he could call in way so we would know.
She yelled NO and offered no assurance if when I could expect him to show up.
I told her make it 2:30 or forget it.
She said no so I hung up.
She consequently called me at 2:30 stating in an almost joyful tone that she was canceling the appr.
Good luck getting any business when you treat people in this manner.

Very courteous and helpful appointment taker and the technician was there on time.
He explained the problems with my heater and it was a quick fix.
My problem was just  maintenance and he did not try to up sale on parts not needed.
I appreciate that.
My house is a newly purchased home and I should have called them before winter to have them do the maintenance need before it got cold.
I will be using this company from now on.
