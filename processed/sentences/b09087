The only way I was able to visit this well to do, upscale country club was a wedding the hubby and I attended this weekend.
Ancala is a beautiful country club with a great views of the golf course from the outdoor patio and bar.
The ceremony was held outside in the heat but luckily the planners were wise enough to place the multiuse outdoor patio on the east side of the main clubhouse to provide ample shade in the late afternoon.
You Arizoinans know your sundials.
We did get a sneak peak at the wedding coordinator's style and professionalism since we did some extra work for our friend the groom.
Dawn and her team were right on cue and nothing but accomodating and thorough with both the ceremony and reception.
She even carried a orange clipboard to match the wedding colors.
Dinner was decent for wedding food and their house wine wasn't bad either.
As a guest we had an enjoyable time at Ancala.

For a membership only place, this place was very sub par.
The food was something I would expect from a local dive bar, not a country club.
The only redeeming factor is the view of the course/camelback and the strong drinks from a limited bar.
