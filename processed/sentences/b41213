I have taken my car in there for the last couple of years.
They have stood by what they do.
I've had a problem that they have worked at resolving, and will continue to work with me until it is taken care of.
Great service, good prices, and all around nice group of people there.
Would recommend to anyone who is in the East Valley - worth the drive to me!

I love Jamey and his staff.
I really apprecate the late night drop off available and that they call me after they diagnois the problem.
Jamey is true to his estiamtes.
I appreciate the faxt hat when he gives me a price I am not paying more when I pick my car up.
I even have my sister taking her car there too.

They performed services for my family on our two trucks and two cars.
They have always made the repairs needed and at a very reasonable price.
They make every effort to see that you are satisfied with their service.
Highest recommendation!
