I like to support our local-small businesses and this is a new business where they sell women's clothing and accessories.They have a variety of styles and more to come.
My girlfriend loves it!
There's not many small local clothing boutiques like this.
Plus, It's at a great location on Sunset Rd!
Usually, we'd have to drive across town or to the strip to find a store like this.
I was lucky enough to walk in the day they opened and they have free sandwiches for their grand opening lol

Yuck.
Low class stuff.
What a dump.
