Dr. Koagedal is professional, compassionate and accommodating.
I have been suffering insomnia for years and he has helped me improve my sleep.
I recommend him highly!
Sleepless in San Francisco

This was my first time receiving acupuncture.
From the moment I walked in I felt relaxed.
The office is decorated very zen like which really set the mood.
The receptionist Mary was seriously the sweetest and made me feel so welcome.
Dr. Koagedal was amazing.
He took the time to listen to my concerns.
The treatment was so relaxing I didn't want it to end.
I felt fantastic after.
Can't wait to go back!

I'm so happy I found Dr. Robert Koagedal!!
It's a very relaxing and zen environment when you walk in.
I never have to wait and it always makes me feel like a priority!
He's there one on one to actually listen and address your concerns.
It's always hard for me to relax since I'm used to being on the go with my 2 year old but when I come for a session he makes it easy to relax and wind down.
I also love that he works with infertility doctors!!
I would highly recommend him!
