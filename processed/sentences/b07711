Clean  Quick Cheap  Do not expect medium to high end food.
It is fast food Chinese version.
The staff is good, the place is usually clean and the prices are not too bad.
I guess you get what you pay for.
I had Bejing beef and it was a little chewy but tasted good.
Angie had steemed veggies and seemed to enjoy them.
The kids had orange chicken and liked it.

I ALWAYS pay in cash at this Panda's.
If it wasn't across the street from work, I wouldn't go here at all.
Two separate times I have been double billed on my debit card for my lunch.
I'm not saying it was intentional, but either way it is annoying to have to dispute a charge with your bank.
Fair warning.

This panda is very slow but food is worth the wait!

This place is ok. With the had some fish items.
But ten again...
I don't think they're known for their "freshness".
Most of the food just sits there for a while.
It does taste pretty good tho.

Why do all Panda Expresses fill the serving spoons full to the top then dump about 1/3 back into the bin then give you whats left?
Now all you have is a ton of chow mien a bunch of soggy veggies  with sauce and a few pieces of meat..!
This location is really good at that.

This is a great spot to grab a bite to eat before the movie.
Typical Panda Express + free wifi.

Very bad Panda.
Don't come here after 8 or the meat and broccoli will seem rotten.
Always extra greasy and unsavory.
Drive down to 59th if you must have it.
