Sweeeeeet!!

Turkey Bacon Spinach Wrap yum!

I really loved the green smoothie.
It was so nice to get some vegetables in Vegas!
They also didn't add any extra sugar upon request.

Had the smoothie + half a sandwich for $8.99.
Great deal!
Island Green smoothie was excellent!
Trust me,  it really is good.
Sandwich was the turkey bacon ranch.
The roll/Bread was very soft and good.
I am full.

Based on the other reviews I gave it a try, and they were right!
I ordered the club sandwich and the wonderful green smoothie and it was all good.
While the sandwich is not huge, it's very tasty, well assembled, and your meal includes an apple or orange as a side.
When traveling it's hard to eat healthy, but this place helps a lot.
The smoothie is really good and it's a great big cup.
The staff there are friendly and seemed to really enjoy working there.
Yes, while I am in Vegas, I am going back there.
Oh, and the sandwich with the huge smoothie and the orange was $12.95, which for Vegas is very reasonable.

I'm a berry person so I tried the acai berry boost.
It was just ok but it lacked a little sweetness to it.

This place is definitely a repeater.
It taste delicious.
I got the cranberry truffle and the beach bum and they were both good.
Lots of flavor and fresh tasting.
The employees very nice and had excellent customer service.
They take the tome to explain the different options and get you the perfect smoothie.
