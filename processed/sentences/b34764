Thank you for timely service and great prices!

I moved from Arizona to NY state last year.
My A/C hasn't been "right" for quite a few years.
Fan, to my A/C & defroster wouldn't work, at times, and would at other times.
Then, had compressor changed here by mechanic--it was "bad".
A/C cold, fine, but  problem again w/ car after that, continuing problem, when A/C was on, with or without fan, it would stall at light or stop sign.
Sometimes it would, other times not.
Car mechanic here found that A/C wiring had been "hijacked" in his words on my bill.
His words, not mine.
He found root cause to be a CCRM, relay module.
Only place I had car worked on last 10 yrs.
was in Arizona  at Greenway, tires put on at Midas and this mechanic who worked on my car A/C twice.
Draw your own conclusions.

I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN.
1 radio tuner nob was missing from the console , the mileage counter no longer functions , the battery had as well been fiddled with and the radio wasn't working properly.
The vehicle was dropped of yesterday and to our knowledge was not worked on.
The following day (today) we drove the vehicle to find that there are several things wrong.
While there the mechanic several times kept trying to separate my mom and me so he could try to muscle her for more money.
They are thieves and liars and I believe there aren't more bad reviews of this business because the majority of their clientele aren't familiar with sites like yelp.
DO NOT GO HERE YOU WILL GET RIPPED OFF.
