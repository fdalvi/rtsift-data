ya, im one of THOSE girls.
you know, the kind that can't change her oil, flat tires, headlights, you get the picture.
i use AAA on a pretty regular basis and today it was the funeral of my battery.
I was sipping my sonic happy hour iced tea, listening to the radio while enjoying the cooler weather and my eventless saturday.
Then i got bored of that, so i decided to take my tea home.
but my car wouldn't start.
what the hay!?!
thankfully, AAA was on my speed dial and they set me up with a 30 minute time frame.
but im pretty much VIP since I use them all the time and a battery truck came to my rescue in like 10 minutes.
I don't know for sure if it's bc of my important, best customer of the year status that it came so quickly but it did and it's safe to assume it's bc they love me so much.
and it's another reason why i love them- ALWAYS on time.
the knight in shining armor (aka dirty work pants and beat up battery truck) came to the conclusion that my battery was dying a slow death.
but he had a spankin new one w a 3 year warranty and it was ready to go for a sweet little price.
he got rid of the old one, installed the new one, and i was on my way.
so for the $70 or so yearly charge for AAA, all i can say is it is SO worth it.
thanks and see you again soon, triple a!

I flew in from Washington, went to my house, and headed to the golf course.
Unfortunately my van wouldn't start.
How could this be?
My son had just purchased a battery for the van from AAA several weeks before, so I called AAA and they had someone out in 10 minutes.
He checked the battery, and the charging system, and everything seemed all right.
He then checked the battery again, and found that there was a dead cell.
He replaced the battery with no questions asked, and apologized for the dead battery.
He was very professional throughout, and definitely knew what he was doing.
And I did get to the golf course in time.
What more could you ask!!
Five stars definitely.

ring ring ring... hi.
aaa az?
am i in a safe location, yes, in the parking lot.
oh where?
at kohl's in Chandler, crossroads, ummm.... hmmm wait a sec.
Oh ok Arizona Ave and I think WIllis rd.
Its by the 202 Santan freeway.... how long will it take, an hr?
color car... well that's a toughie, it's a pathfinder and sometimes it seems silver and other times it's champagne... but maybe silver with a tinge of brown, no, it's not brown... it's silver-ish.
Ok i'll wait... toodles!
yea that's my usual dialogue...
I am an example that shouldn't be...
I play up the stereotype that gay boys are unable to change the tire, i do try and i do know but hell... i don't like my hands to get dirty and plus what's the point of having AAA plus if i can't use that 100 mile towing to tow me to a discount tire to get my tires replaced and checked?
I love aaa arizona for my roadside assistance, for my towing, getting my batterty charged up, or tire changed... it's awesome.
Not I'm not useless nor am I helpless I just believe that if you have the funds and want some peace of mind aaa arizona provides such a service.
I also love my membership gets me discounts at certain places and since I don't have a gold card it looks good in my wallet!

I find AAA to be one of the best decisions I've ever made as an auto owner.
Top notch customer service with no frustrations thus far and I'm a member for the last 5 years.
Highly recommend them to everyone.

I am so happy to have AAA.
They have been a total life saver on more than one occasion.
They will tow your car.
Bring you gas, change a flat tire, and jump  start your car.
Once i even purchased a battery from them and  their mobile van service.
You can also get trip tiks, discounts on travel and many more items.
Certain restaurants will give you a discount with your triple A card.. hard Rock anywhere in the country for one.
This is something i think everyone should have.
It is a life saver.

Never Stranded with AAA  !!!

I have been a member of AAA since 1993.
I gave my wife and each one of my children and membership.
We have used it periodically for different issues, from saving my daughter nasty snow storm to unlocking cars.
I can truly say that having that card available and someone on the other end of the phone has been money well spent.
I recently had to have my car towed twice due to mechanical problems.
Both times the drivers were courteous, friendly and very helpful.
I can't thank you enough for being there during a time in need.
That little card in my wallet is a real large serving of peace of mind.
Thank you

so, as an auto owner, i've had nothing but good experiences with AAA, from Georgia to NM to California to Mass, and back home to AZ, never a problem.
it's the travel department that nearly screwed us for our wedding.
way back when, we looked into destination weddings with a AAA AZ branch.
our rep always said "i'm looking into it, i'll call you tomorrow" and then a week later, i'd call to ask what the hold up was and was met by the same thing.
a month passes by and we find out that rep was fired.
so we've got plenty of time and decide to go to a different AAA AZ branch, the one on Glendale Ave. We were greeted with smiles and elations by their travel rep who said she had a great deal of experience with destination weddings and she would handle EVERYTHING to make our experience hassle free and a joy to remember.
said she did the same trip (although not for a wedding) for a group of friends every year, so she "knew what she was doing".
things went sour from there.
we hardly EVER received return phone calls on time.
all the guests we invited that were to book through this AAA branch never received phone calls back.
so every-single-one of our guests did their own booking with the hotel and airlines....not just 1-2 guests, all of them.
and when we pressed her about this, it was always "oh, my system crashed" or "oh, my phone wasn't working"....come on!
fast forward to a week before our trip departure...for our wedding and honeymoon.
still no word from the AAA rep. Three days before, we FINALLY get confirmation.
you want to see stressed?
how about a bride and groom having to wait till the last minute to find out if all their rooms and flights were booked after paying everything up front?
but the proverbial icing on the cake?
we were advised to have our invitees "donate" a wedding gift to our wedding through the AAA travel website.
that way, those guest that couldn't attend could still give us something and at the end, we'd get a check.
unfortunately, it wasn't that easy.
at no point were we informed that 10% of "donations" would be kept by AAA.
furthermore, my now wife has had to make numerous calls to the AAA office to actually get our wedding "donation" check.
it was always "they're cutting the check today"...a week later...."they're cutting the check today", etc.
to summarize, i'll keep my AAA for cars only.
their travel department was probably one of the most unprofessional, unorganized, and untimely departments i've ever had to deal with.
we would've saved ourselves a boat load of stress by doing it ourselves.

I've been a AAA customer for 14 years in multiple states.
I've never used their travel services but thought it might be worth it to try to book our destination wedding trip and airfare.
Our agent was helpful in booking our room and plane tickets, but when our out-of-state guests tried to call they only got her voicemail....and no return calls.
Multiple friends and family members would call my husband and I stressed out that our travel agent from AAA is not calling them back.
When we questioned our agent, she claims she never received any voicemails or that her "system was down".
When our resort no longer had vacancies, she was unhelpful in assisting one of my guests in finding another resort nearby.
She basically told her she didn't know what else was around.
Isn't this the job of a travel agent?
I will tell you that all 15 of our guests booked their airfare and resort stay ON THEIR OWN.
Our travel agent did not assist a single one in booking.
She became tardy with emails and follow ups and difficult to get in contact with.
She had suggested we register with AAA's Gift of Travel wedding registry without telling us that AAA will charge us a percentage of our wedding gifts as a fee.
When I confronted her with this after the fact she wouldn't return my emails.
When it finally came down to retrieving this money that was our wedding gifts from our guests, she kept telling me the check already cut and sent out.
This was June 1st.
I just received the check on July 19th, after having to follow up multiple times with the branch manager.
It's one thing for my husband and I to have to deal with this hassle, but no bride and groom wants to make things difficult for their guests.
We were very disappointed.

Thank you thank you thank you!!!
I've had AAA roadside service for two years now, and before today I (luckily) never had to use it.
On the way home from running errands today, we got a flat tire in the middle of rush hour on the northbound 51, near Thomas.
It's not the best stretch of highway under the best conditions, but at 4:30 when it's 111 out, no thanks!!
I called AAA and not only were they there within 20 minutes, but the technician brought us cold bottled water and got the spare tire on at lightening speed.
Nobody wants to have to call for help, but it's great to know I have such good service waiting for me if need be.

I got in my car to leave for my job as a teacher and got the dreaded battery click of death.
I called AAA, who sent a van in a prompt manner, but not soon enough for me to get to school on time, so I had to call in a substitute.
The van driver seemed very professional, and offered to replace the battery, install it, and dispose of the old one.
The fees he quoted just kept adding up and up.
I'm not certain how high they might have gone because I let him know I thought over 130.00 for a battery was excessive especially when I am a Premiere member.
I phoned the Honda dealership, who quoted me a price of under 90.00 for a 3-year battery, installed.
I had the car started, and drove directly to Tempe Honda for a new battery and full-car check-up.
The charge was under $90.
And kept $40 in my pocket.
A word to the wise--know your prices before buying a battery from AAA!!

I just want to complain the guy who came for  --- supposed to be ---  "service.
" He was rude from the beginning, as not listened to me, or communicate me (from the beginning - I know everything and you don't know anything attitude).
I explain why I want to change the tire (I do not feel safe to drive & handle is heavy) but he did not change.
He was rude and not explain well why he did not change.
SO, I would like to complain his attitude and tried to write down the name and ID#.
He hide the ID in the pocket.
I tried to see the number and tried to pulled the ID from the pocket, he shouted at me "DON'T TOUCH ME," even I do not touch him at all.
He states "YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GONNA CHANGE THE TIRE & I CALL BOSS.
Why did he need to hide the ID?...
I believe if he did nothing wrong, he can show me his ID.
I called the dispatch and complained his attitude.
He also called the company to complain about me with the twisted story, such as "she grabbed me," "she said -  do not change the tire," but no word about I was trying to see his ID.
Dispatcher told me to let him changed the tire and wanted to talk to him.
I passed my phone to him and he complains me about again lot of lie to protect him.
Besides, he states to the dispatcher "put a note that this customer is rude" in front of me.
I used more than a couple times AAA road service but never had this kind of rude guy.
I've never complain their service even waiting for a long time under AZ heat in the summer (one time I waited for 2 hours).
I liked the service before but anymore.
He was totally jerk.

Great for a jump or flat tire change, but be wary.
If you need a tow, they give you five miles for free, each mile thereafter will cost you five dollars a mile.
That is... unless you signed up for the premium, super duper elitist package.
Then you get one hundred miles of towing for free.
Good to know when your truck breaks down on the way to Vegas, and you need a tow to Wickenburg....sixty miles, ahem, make that three hundred dollars away.
The other thing no one tells you when you sign up is how your wait time will be in the two hour range for a flat or a jump.
That is, unless you signed up for the......  AAA Another would-be roadside samaritan who's succumbed to the corporate, classe system.
Bullshit, but it's better than sitting on the side of the road crying in your coffee mug.

I love triple AAA discount at payless along with a free passport photos yearly!
Free travel guides and maps :) ahhh so worth the membership!
Best of all road side assistance!
Lots of parking at this location!
A travelers best friend!

I was not happy with their mobile battery service.
After getting my car started with a jump-start they then needed to run some "diagnostic testing" to determine the quality of my battery.
The battery test came out as "needs to be replaced".
I was told by the service person my car would not start the next day unless I got a new battery.
He just happened to have a brand new battery available for purchase right then and there from their service truck.
At the time, it appeared the service person was doing me a favor by getting me a new battery to ensure my car would start again.
It seems to me as if this service truck comes with the intent of selling a new AAA battery.
I am disappointed in this AAA service.
This is not what I expect when I buy my yearly membership.
It states on their website that AAA is "Roadside Assistance You Can Trust".
This mobile battery truck is not service I trust.
I have heard of other people being told that their battery would not hold a charge and must be replaced, only to find their car starting without a problem after recharging the battery.
For instance, one person I know of needed a jump-start from AAA after the interior light was left on over-night.
The service person indicated the battery needed to be replaced and offered to get them a brand new AAA battery.
They declined, and were told again they really should have the battery replaced.
They took the car to their local shop, which did a full recharge of the battery (took 1 hour).
That was several weeks ago, and they have had no problems with the battery or starting the car since.
Their battery is not brand new, but it is still working well enough to start their car.
Be aware of this, and that the service person may try to sell a battery.
I would advise taking the car to your regular mechanic shop to have them evaluate it.
It may be that you do not need a new battery.

Thanks for leaving me stranded in a busy road for 1.5 hours.
I enjoyed almost being hit multiple times by careless drivers!
I called at 5:20pm.
I called again at 5:50pm.
Was told that I could expect the truck by 7:45pm, but AAA was willing to expedite for me to 6:45.
I guess it didn't matter that my car was in the roadway, partially blocking traffic.
The tow driver didn't get the request until 6:30pm.
So... it took AAA over an hour to make the request?
Unbelievable.
Up to this point, I have never had a problem, but I had been in safe locations (parking lots).
I guess customers in safe locations get preferred treatment over those stuck in an active lane of traffic.

Time and again (yesterday and today for example), AAA responds promptly, courteously and efficiently.
I can't say enough good about them.
I've been a member for years and can ALWAYS rely on them.
Because I travel to Prescott often, I upgraded to the 100 mile version.
I had to be towed from Skull Valley to central Phoenix and it only cost $40 with the additional miles.
If you don't have a roadside service membership, I'd recommend you look into it.
It's worth it's weight to me just in terms of peace of mind.
They have battery service, as well, which saves a major hassle (yesterday they were there in like 20 minutes).
Whatever they're doing, they're doing it well.

My AAA membership is so worth it!
Their roadside assistance has been a boon quite a few times for me - flat tire on two occasions, dead battery on another two occasions.
Calling for assistance was easy, the people I dealt with on the phone and on the road were very courteous, and the roadside assistance guys arrived in reasonable time and performed the needed services very efficiently.

I absolutely love AAA service.
.have used them a lot..for various things..
The towing services when my truck axle failed outside of Kingman was a blessing.
.i was out on a trip with my kids and her a thump then a knock..and total stoppage 20miles out of Kingman...remembered i had my membership and called and opened a ticket..within 20min a driver arrived.
.was able to get towed into vegas no problem.
Now advise that each service ticket will probably come from a local service provider.
The perks aka discounts are nice too.. %off movie tix..and other things  The travel packages are NICE!
Come on i got into a nice hotel in Redondo beach (off the beach) on memorial day weekend 4nights for $279   Overall i have been impressed.
.this will be my 4th year using AAA Arizona
