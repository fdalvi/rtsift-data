I'm always greeted with a warm smile, no matter who's hosting that day.
I like Street's consistent menu, no matter which location I choose, and I really enjoy their pizza...

Eating in is a decent experience, but for delivery, I have yet to meet their match.
When I order delivery I always get a 16" chicken pizza with alfredo sauce on top, and for the last 6 years I have received it in 30 minutes or less all but 2 times.
Its always tasty, fresh, and is my preeminent food for delivery, ever, period.

Had the pizza and its ok for something quick.
They do have pretty good lunch specials and the service was good.

I'm not a huge pizza fanatic, but this location was my go to on pizza nights.
I was sad to drive by and see they were replaced by a sub shop!
:-(
