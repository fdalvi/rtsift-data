I don't really think you can be a huge fan of a bank but in all retrospects Desert Schools is not among the worst.
Some pros:  Friendly service Easy to set up a bank account for your kids Personal service feeling  Cons:  Sometimes really slow service  Fraud department will freeze account frequently if you go shopping, for example, we frequently go to Tucson to go shopping and on one particular trip we spent a couple of hundred dollars on some clothing stores.
Two days later we were trying to buy the newest Xbox at the Chandler Walmart and we were not able to due to the account being frozen.
Okay, so we purchase the very next morning after speaking with them.
Fast forward to a week later and we were trying to buy a game, again the same thing.
Apparently there is a number you are supposed to call where you can review your charges and let them know it's okay to unfreeze your account.
This has happened countless times and the phone automation thing sometimes will take forever to unfreeze your account.
No real convenient locations They have joined the big boys and charge just as much in fees for those things you need.

Nicest crew and super helpful!
Forget the huge chains, these guys get my business from here on out!
The best
