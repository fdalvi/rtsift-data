This church brought me back to God, nuff said!

I cant find church that I like anymore in AZ.
I could go on on why this church is not for me.
My parents go here...make sense.
I will give $50 to the person that finds a good church in AZ...and plz dont say CVV  FBC orJoy

the worship and teaching are both exceptional!
the atmosphere is friendly and very welcoming to guests, i love it here.

This is the best church EVER.
The worship is amazing.
The message always captivates my heart.
The community that has been built here is so amazing.
Vineyard offers a free medical clinic, food bank, and community outreaches for those in need.
I have never been so blessed!
