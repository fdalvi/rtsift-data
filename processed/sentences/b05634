It's hard to find a good honest mechanic these days.
Hoppy's has always given my family and I great deals on auto repair.
They fix just about anything if you ask or will even help you find someone if they can't help you.
I highly recommend to place, they have been in business Vegas for a very long time and for good reason.
they have probably saved me thousands from expensive repair shops like dealerships.

Hoppys is the worst of the worst.
They use unskilled workers who will damage darn near everything on your vehicle.
They offer a 6 month warranty because that's about how long the so called rebuild will last for.
These are your classic rip off artist.
They screwed me over & wouldn't fix all of the damage that they caused.
Complaint submitted with BBB and channel 13 news.
Will also be contacting INS since they have illegal aliens working there as "techs" what a joke!

You can go anywhere in vegas and get some crap about your car needs this & that, and i will tell you this, this place is staight up!!!
They tell you whats wrong and they fix it.
No BS and no week of waiting while you have no wheels.
They are honest, fast, and they don't cheat you like the other shops around town....call and get a quote, and remember you don't win the best mechanic in the las vegas readers poll for nothing, they are simply the best.

If you are looking for good service this is the right place to go.Its hard to find good honest mechanics in this town but look no further :) The are very well priced and fast at getting your car fixed.
They fix just about anything no matter how big or small the job is, and if they can't they will help you find someone who can :) I recommend this place to everyone :) Thanks Hoppy's for helping me get my shift together :)
