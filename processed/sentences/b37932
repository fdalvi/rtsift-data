Fully alive is incredibly creative, professional and well priced!
I couldn't have asked for a better photographer.

We were so happy with Fully Alive Photography for our wedding.
Tracy was organized, professional, and so much fun!
Throughout the entire process she was easy to communicate with and prompt with responses if I ever had a question.
Our bridal party all commented on how great and fun she was.
Our wedding photos were awesome and I love looking at them, smiling, and remembering what an amazing day it was.
I recommend Fully Alive highly!

I had the most wonderful experience working with Fully Alive Photography - Tracy is a gem, and her pictures are transcendental.
If you want your moments unobtrusively captured and beautifully preserved, you can't go wrong hiring Fully Alive.
Total win!

I have been following Fully Alive for several years and can tell that Tracy has a natural eye for photography.
I finally scheduled a Rock the Dress session almost 11 years after wearing my wedding dress for the first time.
Tracey did my hair and makeup before taking me out into the snow for a fun session.
I knew she would make me look great and she didn't disappoint.
I absolutely love the photos.I look forward to working with her again in the future for family photo shoots.
