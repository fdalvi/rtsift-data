Small store located next to the target at the summit shopping center.
We have stopped in a few times for one or two things.
The layout is pretty standard with the selection of electronics in the middle and supplies on either side of the store.
They also have a computer center with tech support and printing services.

Super easy to find and also super nice inside.
The customer service is great and love how they have a huge printing section inside.
Everything is also always very neat and organized which is great and makes finding everything easy.
