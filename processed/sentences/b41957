My new favorite restaurant.
They have 22 different fish dishes ranging from $16-23, at least a dozen different kinds of pizza slices ready for you to pick out of the case, soups, salads, and 15 kinds of pasta that they will serve with any of 4-6 different sauces.
The food is so yummy!
I rate it 5 stars because the menu is huge, it fits a niche market that is in need of more restaurants, the people are warm and friendly, food is all freshly prepared but the wait is not long, and it is reasonably priced.

GreAt food awesome service .
The best fish in town .
Must go and check it out .
The menu will blow your mind .
Way too much to choose .
They have something for everyone .

Walking into this place looks nice and well kept.
I liked the setup they have.
I'm giving this place five star rating not for how nice and casual it is but for the food.
I haven't tried everything on the menu yet, but I will that's my plan in the near future.
I have had at least five items from the menu so far and I got hooked.
It all tasted to what I expected it to and I'm glad for that because there isn't a lot of kosher restaurants out here, so it's nice to know I can get kosher food in a restaurant and enjoy it.
The menu selections are awesome a lot to choose from, so there's something for everybody that loves to eat from pastas to pizzas and so on.
By the way this place is dairy only.
Give them a try you will enjoy it.
