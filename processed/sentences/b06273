Tory is absolutely unbelievable and is amazing.
She has helped planned a combined bachelor-bachelorette party and is still working on our wedding!
You are in the best hands when you choose Tory!
A+++

Tory just did our wedding two weekends ago and she is absolutely amazing!!
We could not have done it without her!
My wedding day was perfect and stress-free thanks to all her hard work.
I cannot thank her enough!

I don't think I could have survived without Tory!
In addition to being well connected ( I think she knows everyone in the wedding industry) and having a great eye for detail, Tory is exceptionally personable and knows how to decrease stress levels.
I was unusually stressed during the few days surrounding my wedding and Tory took on communicating with vendors and family, coordinating transportation and deliveries, and decor.
We had a detour on the way to the wedding due to an accident and Tory was on the phone with limo drivers giving them alternate routes to our venue.
Everything she did for us was above and beyond our expectations.
