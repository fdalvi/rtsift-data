Today has been one huge defeat after another.
I overslept.
Not a huge deal, but irritating.
Then I went out the flat without my keys.
Again, fixable, but annoying.
Then the worth thing happened.
I pulled my camera out (my nice, expensive digital slr) and found, at some point between using it last and that moment I'd smashed the LCD screen.
Cue panic, lots of swearing and more panic.
I rang the only camera shop I know in Edinburgh and they quoted me Â£115 to fix it.
WHAT?!
I came across this place and thought I'd take a chance.
Now, I won't lie, they don't do cameras or camera repairs in there.
They fix audio equipment and TVs at an extremely cheap rate.
The reason this place gets 5* is because the guy in there took the time to tell me all the camera specialists in the area he knows (he's in the 'biz') and even drew me a map explaining how to get there.
Considering he was getting no business from me, he really didn't need to do that, but he did.
And if that's not a mini victory then I don't know what is.
