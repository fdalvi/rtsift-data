Buyer Beware, I purchased an Engine from this business and was told that they were tested before being sold .
I invested travel time and money to have this engine installed only to find it was full of metal chunks.
Allthough they were kind enough to sell and credit me another engine I had to re-invest more money and time to remove the first engine.
I had the same experience with the 2nd engine as it only lasted 21/2 months.
This business offered no compensation for my troubles.
They were very nice and quick to write my credits but that was it.
So Buyer Beware of this business... JMP

Awesome customer service.
Worked with Katy & another gentleman whose name I've forgotten but they helped me track down parts for my dodge truck that they didn't have in stock at the time.
Would definitely recommend them if you're looking for a cheaper alternative for parts.

Unfriendly and unhelpful.
They don't want walk in business.
Go to the internet for new parts at a lower price.
NEW AT A LOWER PRICE!
