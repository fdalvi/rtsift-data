Stopped in here because I was tired and didn't feel like driving to my favorite spot.
It was a hot day and it was equally hot inside.
Nail spas are supposed to be where you can relax, not sweat during a pedi.
Aside from the warm atmosphere it wasn't busy and I was sat in a chair with hot water promptly.
staff is ok...not great,  not bad.
The work was decent.
Would I return?
No.

I had to clean up my nails once I got home!
Had a gel manicure that was thrown on hastily resulting in gel adhering to my skin.
My pedicure was also lack luster.
Sloppy job.
I picked a lighter color this time and apparently the dark color I had on previously was not completely removed - you can see dots of dark color under the new polish.
Lastly, the owner is so caught up in getting paid in cash she asked me 3 times during my mani/pedi if I had cash on me.
I explained that I did have cash for the tip, but not the whole service.
She preceded to ask me how much cash I had on me.
Rude, not relaxing and I will not be back.
