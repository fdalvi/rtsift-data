First I must start off saying that I love my pets like children so if you are of the same mind set, you will understand how hard it is to trust someone with your animals.
Cindy is the owner and she runs this business with her daughter.
I have known them for over 5 years now and have used them to pet sit my animals every time I leave town.
If there was an angel for animals that walked on this earth, Cindy is just this.
Her attention to detail, love for animals and care is beyond my highest expectations.
She is so good to my animals and takes very good care of my home while I am gone.
My puppys love her and can not wait for their walks with Cindy.
Cindy is part of our family now and I am so happy to have her in my life.
I would recommend her with the highest regards.
Her services include at your home or on special circumstances at her home to watch your pets, she checks your house, grabs the mail, waters the plants, makes sure the house is secure as well as the feeding, cleaning and excerise of your pets.
She has great rates, and has never ever let me down.

Cindy is wonderful!!
She takes wonderful care of our cat and treats her well.
She is very detailed and thorough with her reports on what happened while you are away.
We have used her for about 2 years and I would not use anyone else!

I cannot say enough about Cindy's Lots A Lovin' Pet Sitters.
She is absolutely the most giving, wonderful, kind and trusting dog sitter anyone could ever wish for.
We've been using Cindy's services for some 10 years now.
Every time we go away on a trip we do so without a worry or care in the world, knowing our dog and home will always be getting the best TLC and attention possible.

Cindy is TERRRRRRIFIC!!!
She is also dependable, detailed, and communicates well with us when we are away.
Our doggies love her and we love her cheerful personality.
She does, however, need a Facebook page so we can "like"  her there as well.
