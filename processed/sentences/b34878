We are so grateful to have found Rescue My Speech.
My daughter loves seeing these therapists.
They are always ao kind, helpful and professional.
They are always willing to answer your questions and genuinely care.

"My son has been coming here for 11 months with Ali and I am completely amazed at how well he is talking.
The staff is warm, friendly, caring & amazing at their jobs!!

My son has been coming to Rescue My Speech since July 2012.
At the time, he could say nothing.
Jayme and her team of therapists have worked with my son and his improvement is amazing.
The love and enthusiasm the team has for children is genuine, and their skills as speech therapists are outstanding.

I think they do so well w/ the kids.
My daughter has shown such an improvement over the last month, but is it too much to ask that the therapists acknowledge the parents?
They are so rude, they just walk on by, not even a "hello" or maybe a smile.
Three stars for doing what they're paid to do, but for their lack of courtesy....this is a business after all.

My pediatrician recommended Rescue My Speech when I expressed concern regarding my three year old's speech.
The first evaluation was so informative and I knew he was in experts hands.
He loved going to therapy and loved Ali.
They came out of every session with "homework" that we could do if he wanted.
It was worth every penny for the peace of mind I had knowing he had the best care and also the confidence and mastery he has gained in his sounds.
So glad we went for the first evaluation- thank you to the whole team there as they have discharged us:) Erica F

I took my daughter in today, Saturday 7/27, there was one family leaving when we got in.
Dean was who our appointment was w/.
This was my first time meeting him, he greeted us when we came in, was attentive, asked questions, and went over how my daughter's session went and his opinion on her progress.
Very impressed this time around.
