Never Again!
The place is filled with Ginzo low-classers that live there.
UNBELIEVABLE!
Out of all the rooms in the place, most of which were empty, they put us in the very back (a mile or so back) next to druggies that lived there and were up all night screaming and sitting in their cars smoking and shaking.
And 1/2 of the rooms electrical outlets did not even work, the TV was unusable as it had no remote and the power button was gone.
No refrigerator and no hot water.
Really Right Now?

It was an alright place to stay.
My room was clean and spacious.
The bed was huge which was a plus for because I move around a lot in bed.
They had and iron and ironing board which I needed desperately.
Plenty of towels.
Didn't have a coffee machine which I thought was standard now in hotels and motels; lose one star.
They're "all-inclusive" breakfast consisted of cereal and store bought danishes; another star lost.
And everytime I was in the lobby, the receptionists were dealing with some angry customer, either in person or on the phone.
All in all, my experience was pretty good.

For the price, it's just what I expected.
The bed felt decent, clean bedspreads, spacious room.
If your looking for a comfortable inexpensive place to stay for a night or two, it fits the bill.
I'm in the back, parking is pretty packed.

Pros: cheap, convenient location Cons: crappy a/c (in the Phoenix summer) and cockroaches in the bathroom.

This place is fucking garbage and should be condemned.
First room I got was fucking filthy, internet drops in and out and the dumb motherfucker at the front desk is NO help.
