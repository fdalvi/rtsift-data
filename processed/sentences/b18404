This is a good, clean Chevron with slightly more spacious stalls for filling up your car.
Nice location on SE corner of Bell & 75th ave.

Went to the bathroom while the gas was pumping and the store smelled like the damn bathroom, as soon as i walked into the store i knew i was in for something nasty.
clean your shit !!!

The biggest piece of shit gas station I've ever been to.
Got off work fairly late, went to just purchase a car wash inside (I work nights) and after purchasing a car wash, and the car wash drive thru was BROKEN, the man inside couldn't refund me my money, nor give me any contact information on upper management.
Told me I have to come back tomorrow and my money would be refunded AFTER he had sold me the car wash... WTF!
If u knew it was broken... THEN DONT SELL ME THE CAR WASH!!!
simple as that!
