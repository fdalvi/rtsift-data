Dr. Jones and his staff have a great practice here!
Records and pre visit paperwork are all electronic.
Testing is performed with the latest technology to facilitate quick and accurate diagnosis without discomfort.
Dr. Jones and his staff are very personable and my visits have always been great!
Very convenient for the lower east valley and I highly recommend this practice to take care of your vision needs.

I love my yearly exams with Dr. Jones.
The high tech machines make the  evaluation of my eyes such a pleasure !!

I had the best vision appointment  @ Premier Eyecare of Arizona.
The office is very nice.
I was given a warm greeting welcoming me upon entering.
The young lady who performs the initial tests was so nice and made me feel comfortable.
She explained the tests and answered all my questions.
Dr. Jones was great, my questions were his priority.
He is so knowledgable and has a gift in explaining difficult things in an easy way for anyone to understand.
I couldn't have been more pleased.
My family will be seeing this office for all our vision needs.

Dr Jones is amazing.
I have terrible prism and astigmatism issues.
He has been the only doctor who has gotten my lenses correct the first time.
I would recommend him to anyone especially, if they have difficult eye issues.
The staff is also amazing.
Amanda, especially.
They know exactly what needs to be done and how to do it.

New patient to Premier Eyecare.
My first visit went well, the staff and doctor were pleasant to see.
Thus far, would recommend this office to others.
