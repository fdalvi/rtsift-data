It is a nice  store, but not enough employees to service the busy times.

I love this 7-Eleven because they have the most friendly attendants I've ever ran into.
They are always quick to start a conversation, and to thank you for coming.
You always leave with a smile!
Best gas station in the Horizon Ridge area

Great Service every morning from JD & Nikki for my morning coffee break.
Can't forget about Jonathon on 3rd shift!
Keep up the great work!

Awesome customer service.
Always clean and super helpful.
Love the coke machine this is a daily  stop for me

Hey, go there like 2am and you most likely see the guy outside with some girl,who was sitting on a stool.
Went in to get a hotdog.
Right, they were dark in color and all wrinkled .
Nice deal 1/4 lb.hotdog and chips too bad it was more like 1/4 lbeef jerky and chips.
I walked out with nothing and went over to Timbers.
I won't take a chance going there to get something fresh.

It's a nice place , but !!
They have to keep up with the fresh coffee , 80 % of the times I have to make my fresh coffee
