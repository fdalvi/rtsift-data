The staff here makes the place great!
Every time I come here the employees are prompt, polite and really friendly.
And the KFC bowl is heaven in a dish.

How the hell does this place have five stars!!!
This is the closest KFC to my residence so I am forced to go to this one when I'm craving chicken littles.
I am not writing a bad review based on one bad experience either!
This is the third time this has happened and its shocking at how LAZY this staff is!!
A chicken little consists of two bread buns, the chicken, a spread and PICKLES.
Three different times and not even in a row I have ordered a total of 4 chicken littles and not one of them had pickles on it.
A Bunch of Idiots work here so PLEASE save yourself the anger and drive somewhere else or dissect your food in the drive thru before going home to disappointment.

Seriously?
This place hella sucks.
Customer service is just bad!
Sooo I went through the drive through and the lady on the speaker too her sweet time asking what I would like.
I asked about a few things and decided on a mixed 10 piece bucket thing.
She stated I could get 2 boneless breasts then a mixture of anything else.
I did just that, I wanted 2 BB and the rest legs.
OF COURSE they were a few short of what I wanted so she offered more breasts to which I accepted.
She gave me my total, which was not the same as she had quoted earlier and I proceeded to the window.
A different lady then gave me ANTOHER more expensive total and I asked why?
"Because you added more breasts" I rebutted that the order taker offered since they were out and the cashier shook her head and reassured me I would need to pay the upcharge.
Don't offer something because you ran out of an item then expect the customer to pay.
And 3 different totals is no bueno!
I asked for my card back and left.
Customer service is horrid and the employees seem like they hate their jobs.
No Yay!
for you!

The food was fine.
However, there was no one in the restaurant but us after 9:00 pm.
We waited so long, probably near a half an hour to get chicken, hot wings, chicken pot pie, and chicken bites.
This cost about $23.
This seemed like a lot.
The place also wasn't super clean.
The guy that took our order had a really hard time with it.
Maybe he was new.
