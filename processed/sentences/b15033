Clean.
Doesn't smell like chemicals are everywhere.
I've visited some salons where you cannot breathe.
Seats for the pedicure are comfy and nice.
The attendants are pleasant and they are knowledgable.
I am very ticklish and they handled me with care and respect.

Went in at 3:00 and they told me the wait was an hour.
Called back an hour later and they told me the wait was another 40 minutes, so I made an appointment at 5:00 for a fill and pedi.
I showed up on time and they made me wait 15 minutes and sat me in a chair from 5:15-5:50 with my feet soaking.
Ridiculous.
You don't have someone make an appointment and then make them wait almost an hour to even be helped.

I didn't check the reviews before going in (I should have).
The workers were pleasant and I enjoyed my hot stone massage.
I wasnt too thrilled with the Polish job.
I probably won't go back.
