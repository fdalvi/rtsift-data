Maybe it's just Scottsdale...maybe it's the fact that I don't dress up to go to Fashion Square...but I've never had a pleasant shopping experience at this location.
Only when I'm with my mom and we're clothed in nicer attire do we get a teeny bit of service.
Maybe because we look like we have money to spend?
The attitude of the staff is pretentious, even though they are just retail sales people.
Get over yourselves.
And learn your trade:  CUSTOMER SERVICE.
When I'm spending $96 on a skirt and $108 on a blouse I want some damn attention.
The sales associates are in their own little world, oblivious to the potential customers that grace the store.
When it comes time to purchase my clothes I'm usually ignored, unless I have my cash out and I'm holding $500 worth of merchandise.
This place is the last I want to visit in Fashion Square.
I avoid it when I can, but the clothes fit me like a glove...thus my patronage continues.

I like their clothes, they are pretty good quality.
The prices are not the cheapest, but it you can wait a few weeks, you can usually find something you wanted on sale.
Yes, I totally agree, customer service is not their strong suit.
It is surprising in this economy that they cannot find better staff.
I found a pair of nice dress pants, a pair of walking shorts, three tops and a dress for about $150.00.
I think that was a great deal.
