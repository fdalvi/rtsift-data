Got a groupon voucher for a session of Eyelash extensions.
I came in this morning and was greeted by Lorraine.
Being an eyelash extension advocate and wearer for many years I am very picky, selective, and critical of my eyelash beautician.
She put on a nice sticky cooling eyepad that did not slide off or become dismantled.
She was very quick in putting the eyelashes on with precision.
I got in at 11 and left 36 minutes later.
I'm used to a one and a half hour session.
They look great but I could have got a couple more lashes in place!
Will definitely go to her for some maintenance.
Only downside of this place would be that it is a bit pricey, I wouldn't have gone in for extensions that start at Â£70.
