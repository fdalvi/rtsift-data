This is the best spa I've found since I moved here in December.
I am very picky and the girls remembered me and what I like and what I don't like.
They made me feel very comfortable and welcome.
They are sweet, clean, fast and the polish last a very long time.

I got the most expensive pedicure.
It was well worth it.
I was there for about an hour.
The place was very clean, clean tools, friendly, and they made me feel comfortable ever since I walked in.
They also gave me a complementary water bottle and they also offer soft drinks.
They have a vast variety of nail polishes.
I can't wait to go back for another pedicure!
The girl took her time and was very gentle and explained everything she was doing and why.

I have mixed feelings on this salon.
It's super clean and cute.
The staff was friendly.
I really liked my pedicure, the nail tech did a good job, but didn't do anything to my cuticles.
My manicure was done by someone else and was only so-so.
Never soaked my fingers, again nothing done to my cuticles, and she used the buzzer thing they use to rough up your nails for acrylics, except I was just getting a shellac manicure.
I HATE the buzzer thing and when I asked to not have it she said my polish wouldn't hold- however I've never had a salon use the buzzer before.
I'd maybe go back for a pedicure, but no way would I go back for a shellac manicure.
