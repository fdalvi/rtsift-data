Just went to "Tony's".
New owners straight from Chicago.
Had great pizza and my family enjoyed real saucy wings.
Gave us all free samples of the Italian ice.
Yummy!
Also enjoyed the conversation.
These are the nicest guys you will meet!
Open late & delivery.
They just took it over so they are going to be redoing the interior.
Support local business and really good people.
Give it a try!

Don't judge a book by its cover when you pull up to Tony's because everything that comes out of the kitchen is gold.
The ingredients were fresh, the sauce had wonderful flavor, and the crust was crispy all throughout.
The chocolate cheesecake and free Italian ice samples were also outstanding.
If you're in the area, stop in and support a local business.
You won't be disappointed!

New ownership.
It is not Chicago-style pizza at all.
They didn't honor the $5 for $10 Yelp Deal I purchased.
We ordered extra cheese pizzas to be delivered.
The pizza was mediocre, but the delivery was pretty fast.
I'd rather pick up a $5 Little Caesar's cheese pizza than order from them again.
Unimpressed, but not disgusted.
