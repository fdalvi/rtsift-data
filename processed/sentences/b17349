My brother was craving chinese when he was in town, so we thought we'd give this spot in DC Ranch (Market Street) a whirl.
It was sad because although the food was quite good, the place was empty!
Granted, it was a Monday night, but having other diners always adds to a restaurant experience.
Regardless, the food was some of the best chinese I've head.
My husband and I shared the hot and sour soup (which is a huge serving, by the way), as well as the lettuce wraps (equivalent to PF Changs or Yard House - good but basic).
My brother had the egg rolls and was very pleased.
I had chicken and vegetables in a white sauce, and my husband had the same in a lobster sauce.
My brother had sweet and sour chicken, and each was very, very good.
The leftovers tasted great as well!
We will come back the next time we have a craving for chinese.
