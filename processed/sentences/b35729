I love Chiefs tavern its kinda like home.
You can walk in have a beer have a burger, and chill.
The bartenders are laid back and down to earth!
The food is pretty awesome considering this chill atmosphere they serve quite a selection of upscale bar food.
Ex: reuben sandwhiches, salmon burgers, TLT ( tomato Lettuce Bacon and smoked trout sandwich, chiefs chicken sandwich, burgers, steak sandwich, Gyros.
they serve fresh non fried food which is a nice change for a bar.

Stopped in on a Friday night and we were treated to live music at a shocking 6:30 p.m. startup time!
I tried the smoked trout sandwich, which also has bacon.
So if you want an overdose of smoked goodness, this is a safe bet.
The menu is extremely small, but well done.
During busy times some patience will be needed, but it is worth it.
Good beers on tap, and a very clean place.
It reminds me of when I was growing up and people would turn their basements into bars and host their friends.
We will be back, hopefully for the Sunday blues jam.

I go here after my golf league every week and get consistently great service.
Regulars are friendly and the place is comfortable, although a little small when the karaoke crowd gets in.
Limited menu, but what's on it is great.
Try the TLT (trout, lettuce, tomato) w/ Bacon.
You'll love it and if you really like trout, tell them to leave the skin on.
It takes it to another level.
