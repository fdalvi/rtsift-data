This girl working the refreshment counter had no personality and was a little rude.
Plus all the tables are dirty.
Mom & I like to stop the refreshment area for some sticks & pizza while shopping this Target...we enjoy these little stops.
But it can be hit or miss with the employees.

The pharmacy people were pleasant
