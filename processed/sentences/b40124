Maribel is the best.
Been loyal to her for bout 6 months now doing my Brazilian wax.
She's very clean first and for most.
And my Brazilians are cleaned waxed lol.
Had me in  and out within 25mins Thanks girl!

I have been seeing Maribel for over 3 years for eyelash extensions and she constantly amazes me.
I've been to multiple people for eyelashes and she is by far the best.
She has a unique level of detail not found in most people.
She listens to how you want your eyes to look and applies the lashes exactly to give you that desired appearance.
She is able to make the lashes look full while still looking very natural and her lashes last longer than anyone else I've been to.
The method in which she applies the lashes actually has made my natural lashes stronger.
Not only in she skilled in lashes, but she is an eyebrow genie as well.
She honestly excels in every area.

First time having a Brazilian wax, it was kinda painful but I love the results.
She gave me helpful tips to control the irritation.
I will be seeing her again in about 5 weeks :) Thanks again!

Maribel did my lash extensions...awesome work!
She is very good at this job of placing a lash on EACH of my lashes.
It requires a lot of patience and talent.
Check out what it takes on the Internet and all the things that can go wrong...it's very scary.
Don't take a chance and just go to Maribel.
The compliments I received were many and well worth it.
Just do it!
