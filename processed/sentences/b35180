A girlfriend writes the cutest blog and had featured the unique monogram bracelet for her Mother's Day blog.
I had to have it.
So, we went to Found by Domestic Bliss in downtown Mesa to get the bracelet as my Mother's Day gift.
What a cute, classic and if you are into French, this home accessory store is for you.
You have to check out their website to see all their interior design ideas.
They have a small jewerly section but all monogram items that are unique  If they do not have what you want they will order it for you.
Approximately 2 week wait.
Charms, bracelets, necklaces and rings.
The staff is very friendly and the store is very inviting.
Make sure you call ahead as they only open on certain days and they do have special discounts on certain accessories each month.

Great reason to go to Downtown Mesa.
Was there on Saturday and loved the shop.
The designs are interesting and the displays are inspirational.
You are certain to love the shopping experience here.
Don't be intimidated by the LightRail construction that will begin shortly.
Keep supporting the businesses along this stretch.

Truly a great owner who cares about his customers!
I highly recommend a visit if you like one of a kind, quality pieces....young, yet classic, tasteful, yet funky.

This tucked away store is a great place to find unique items for your home.
Each time I go in there it is a completely different store, they keep the inventory fresh and fun.
