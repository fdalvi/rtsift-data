Another fast food place located in the food court a Meadows Mall.
My kid like this place so I let him give it a go.
To me everything looks dried out & very pastey sauces.
They no longer have crispy beef and the other stuff just looks weird so my son chose ORANGE Chicken w/ half noodles half rice.
Whats up with the Fried rice w/NO pork?
Yuk!
I'm NOT a fan I'd rather go to Pick Up Stix at least its made to order.

I stopped by last week for the free Tangy Jumbo Shrimp with an internet coupon.
The restaurant was located in the Meadows Mall in Las Vegas.
I got 3 shrimp with the tails on mixed with red bell peppers and green beans.
I would not pay for the Tangy Jumbo Shrimp.

Good solid Panda Express.
It is in the Meadows Mall.
There is never too long of a line.
When I walked up and ordered a Panda bowl with vegetables side.
They made the veggies fresh while I waited.
Then I added the peppercorn shrimp.
I wish I go more than 6 shrimp with the veggies that come with the peppercorn shrimp, but my whole meal was a total of 270 calories.
It was filling and tasted good.
I enjoyed it.
When I am not on a diet, I enjoy the cream cheese ragoons.
The mall is right across from my work.
I have no complaints about this place.
