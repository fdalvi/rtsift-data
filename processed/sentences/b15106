I had a hard time finding this business on yelp because the place that I went to at this address was called "My Nails & Spa," not Tony Nails.
However, since it's the same address, I'm fairly confident it's the same place.
(Interestingly, there is a "My Nail & Spa" (Nail is singular, not plural) on yelp in a very nearby location, but the address is different, so that's definitely not the place I went to.
)  I walked in to My Nails & Spa on a Sunday afternoon without an appointment and I put my name on a list, but I only had to wait maybe five minutes before they had a spa chair ready for me.
Tim did my pedicure and he was really friendly, professional and did good work.
My pedicure lasted a good 2 weeks before showing any wear.
I know you're supposed to get it done every 2 weeks, but I always like to push it and see how long it will last.
At 3.5 weeks out, there was some minor chipping at the tips of the nails and I could see a clear line where the polish stopped and new nail growth showed - time to go back.
$25 for the pedicure, so it was OK value.
Price alone would've earned this place 3 stars, but an extra star is added for service.

The staff at My Nails & Spa (the name on the sign outside the shop) are really friendly & easy to chat with.
The wait time is never more than 10-15 minutes, which is a huge plus for me because I always decide to get a mani &/or pedi at the last minute.
I can't say that there's anything that really stand out about this place that's different than the other nail salons in the area, but it's really close to my house so that's why I'll continue to go there.
