Big branch building not usually too busy.

Worse bank ever!
If it wasn't so difficult to switch and to open a new business account I would have already done it.
Do not open an account with Bank of America!

No tellers.
Really.
Hire hire hire.
Today 2 tellers.
Yesterday At 4pm 1 teller.
This bank really sucks.
They have a greeter and plenty of personnel to open accounts and do loans.
But no tellers.
Really!

This is the worst branch ever .
There is always a long line and not enough tellers to help you .
I'm using different branch all over vegas and all of them have enough tellers,  and usually I'm in and out in 5 minutes but this branch is at least 25 minutes wait.
