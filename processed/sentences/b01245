I normally get the steak Carne Asada Taco's and let me tell you they ROCK!!!
You get a plate of three tacos with some chips, beans or rice and  with a drink for about $5-6 bucks.
Great stomach filler for cheap.
And hey pop a few coins into the jukebox while you wait for some interesting looks haha ;)

Taco Trio of beef pork and chicken, rice and beans.
Man that was some good grub.
I preferred the pork.
Try it.

Pretty blah, really.
It's fast food but with sit down prices and barely fast food taste.
The taco platter Jesse mentioned, is three street tacos on a styrofoam plate which has other little compartments filled with a a few spoonfuls of rice, beans, avocado sauce, and chopped lettuce.
They sprinkle a handful of chips over the top.
The meat isn't char grilled, but steamed on a flat-top and is greasy/wet enough that the little tortillas break apart before you get halfway through the first one.
I ended up dumping the mix into a pile, tossing the tortillas, and eating it like cereal.
Not horrible, but also not worth the price.
The combos are $6.75 and drinks are extra ($2).
so for $9 you get a pretty weak meal compared with other good/cheap Mexican places or decent sit down joints with service.

This place has decent prices and good tacos.
I get the 3 taco meal.
I think the pork is awesome.
Tacos come on corn enchilada shells (a plus in my book) and are served with refried beans and rice.
They offer a choice of green or red salsa.
I had the red it was mild/mediumish  in strength.
Tacos are served with salsa and onions with lettuce and tomato given in a bed underneath.
Great food - Very filling.
I would recommend trying it if in the area!
A-OK grub.
