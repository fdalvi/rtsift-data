The staff hear is very helpful.
I raced for the first time on 11/25/2012 and the track was a excellent short corse for electric cars, I broke several times and the staff was very helpful in getting me going again.
The rc cars and parts were well priced not over priced like other rc stores in Peoria Glendale area.
I look forward to racing hear again.
