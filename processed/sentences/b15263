This is a local General Store that takes care of the locals!
Drive by this place all the time, wished I have stopped by a long time ago!
What an awesome place!
They just don't make these anymore!!
It's been years since I have seen a store like this, has a lot of equipment for the local farmers and horse owners!
Has a sandwich deli, offers pizza, chili dogs, hot sandwiches, AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING OF ALL!!!!!!
THRIFTY ICE CREAM!!!!!!!!!!
Yes!!!!
Here we are my wife and I have been arguing about were to go for ice cream!
We both grew up with Thrifty Ice Cream, Now this place doesn't sale their ice cream at a cheap price.
"Remember the old 35 cent scoop at Thrifty Drug Store!
But now we have a place to go, when we are in a mood for ice cream!!!
If anyone is near by, you just gotta pay a visit.
I really think its a really cool store.

It a God send being out here in the almost boonies.
You can get just about everything there, hot food to go, random food staples, stuff for your farm and so on.
Everyone is really nice and helpful.

Cute little General store across the street from post office.
They have saddles cowboy hats sunglasses food if you need something quick on way home they also have beer.
This store also serves pizza and subs I have not yet tried them though I did have a pretzel.
It was warmed in the microwave  packed with salt but you get a lot of cheese.
I will never get one of those again.
I like the popcorn though.

The best ice cream around.
Such a neat little convenient store.
They have sandwiches, hot dogs and even pizza.
We've never tried anything but the ice cream.
We go back for it every time though.
My parents always stop in for some ice cream when they are in town also!
