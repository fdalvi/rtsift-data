This is a homey thrift store.
You'll find your typical thrift store items here.
Worn books, faded clothes, silly trinkets, outdated jewelry, ruffed up furniture, and abundant accessories.
I had a hard time finding many purchases, but I enjoyed shopping the store.
The employees were cheery and helpful.
They even asked me to fill out a computer survey so I could get a discount!
I love the proceeds help to support HospiceCare too!
If I lived in Madison, I would stop by on occasion as does my mother, who lives there.

i like the priced-to-move prices on the kitchen and housewares and the great selection of collectibles.
the employees are all volunteers with super great attitudes.. no burnt out minimum wage employees.
the clothing is limited and seems old-lady like , would like to see a more expanded collection.

I LOVED that they have more well maintained furniture unlike some other thrift stores.
They actually have a pretty large housewares section as well!
Lots of plates/cups/utensils, and quite a few bone china sets--if you're into that sort of thing!
They also had fabulous FUR coats on display....of course at $1k they are still pretty pricey, but I'm sure WAY cheaper than what they would retail for.
Pretty cool that they have these kinds of items here.
If you're looking for odds/ends and some classy tea sets without the hefty pricetag--then you're bound to find something here!
