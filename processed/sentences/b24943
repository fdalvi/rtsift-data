Don't go anywhere else for your granite!
Superior installed our granite kitchen counters last weekend and did an amazing job.
Their team is knowledgeable, professional and able to schedule appointments and installs within a matter of days.
We couldn't be more pleased with our entire experience with Superior and the end product...our kitchen is now awesome!
PS: their prices will beat any competitor, so don't waste your time and gas shopping around!
Just head straight to their showroom.

Highly recommend to others.
Timely and free in home estimate, got to choose my granite slabs at the showroom, competitive prices, timely and good quality install.
My kitchen turned out great!

First part of the process went well.
The person who came out to measure/estimate our countertops was friendly and walked us through all the options/pricing.
The next week, we drove an hour and 15 minutes to the showroom to look at slabs and bring back some samples.
We found two styles we really liked, and got samples for each.
We took the samples home, and picked one that we really liked.
I called in and asked our salesperson if we could make an appointment the next week to pick out 2 slabs in the style we'd chosen.
He checked the inventory and said they had plenty, so we made the appointment.
That saturday came, and we drove an hour and 15 minutes to the showroom, only to find that the style we'd picked out had sold out.
Which means we'd made a 2.5 hour round trip for nothing.
At no point during the week did we receive a phone call telling us it had sold out and we needed to reschedule.
The salesperson didn't apologize or take responsibility... just said "at least it's a nice day for a drive.
" No apology.
No acknowledgement that he could have called us.
That kind of service doesn't fly when we're taking about spending thousands of dollars on a remodeling project.
Needless to say, we took our business elsewhere.
