They have a BOA bank inside which is just about the only reason I go here anymore.
The prices are outrageous.
They have a turnstile you have to walk through and if you are my height it really hits you in the -----!!
The deli is ok, but really overpriced and the place is nearly empty everytime I go.
Too much Money for average quality.

Although this one is a little dated inside, it's not crowded especially since the B of A closed (that was the most crowded section of the store).
This means one can find something easily and get in and out without too much muss and fuss.
If we're in the area (lots of shopping as well as restaurants around here), we'll stop in for a few things (ever since the whole gas hike, we've been planning out our trips).
Very good selection of gift cards.
There's a deli/snack bar and florist in addition to the food/liquor/meat/produce sections.
Vons on average has higher prices than Smiths.
Markdowns on seasonal items are usually located in the front of the store.

How is there a line when nobody shops here?
I used to live down the street from this dump of a grocery store, and would not recommend shopping there.
The produce appears to sit for longer than it should due to the lower volume this Vons does.
This means you may not be so excited to pick up those peppers and spinach and bring them home to your family.
The store's appearance is dated, and not maintained very well.
I have never seen more than one cash register open, which means that when you and the other 6 people in the store check out, you'll be waiting for a while.
On top of that, the employees seem just as unhappy as you to be there.
Since there are so many options for groceries in town, choose ______  instead.
(It doesn't matter what you fill the blank with, it will be better than this place.
