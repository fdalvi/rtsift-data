This review is on one of the company drivers...For sure the customer service skills need some assistance.
Their driver was behind me at a light today and because I didnt try to beat the green light for a left turn( which turns to a green arrow just following) honked repeatedly and was flipping me off...and my child was in the care with me to watch this guy yelling and flipping me the bird.
And if the company reads these reviews the license plate was 059 YRJ- bald headed angry man needs a write up!

I've used Integrity a few times over the past few years and have nothing but good things to say about them.
Installers have always been knowledgeable and funny/helpful.
The chicks answering the phones are super helpful too.
I got the gift card that was promised , and that is the main reason I started using this company.
Great job guys !

Pretty easy to schedule and the guy that came out did a great job.
I thought he did some high quality work.
I called them for the $50 gift card.
I had the understanding I would have this 2 weeks after the install and it was closer to 3 weeks.
Just keep that in mind.
Overall, I'd use this company again.

Very easy and convenient process.
Everyone was polite, professional and had terrific work ethic.
They do fantastic work on both chips and full replacement (I have used them for both).
The entire staff is sincere and made sure I was taken care of with my insurance company as well.
