Dark, drinks well poured, great jukebox atmosphere.
Let's call it comfy.

Great place to watch a game.
Friendly service, honest prices on their drinks, and a great place to make friends :)

One of the nicest interioirs of a bar around here.
Very Clean.
Staff is friendly and actually introduced themselves after a shift change...awesome!
You can order foor next door at the gyro joint...good food and folks there too.

Friendly service, wide open with 4 pool tables.
First time here for happy hour.
Bar seems pretty clean for a dive bar.
Cheap drinks!
No bar rescue here!
I would come back!
