Great food.
Friendly staff.

Good food, great value!
My favourite KW breakfast place!

I cannot speak for their lunch and dinner service, but I will vouch for the excellent breakfast options.
This is a Greek restaurant so there are some wonderful options that you won't see elsewhere, Greek style sausage, olives and feta often join omelettes and other more traditional breakfast fare.
Breakfasts are big but not absurdly overlarge and include; bacon & eggs, waffles, eggs Benedict and meat lover options.
Vegetarian friendly too.
Never found a errant bacon shard in the taters, whew!
Try it and let me know how the dinners are!
Cheers ;)
