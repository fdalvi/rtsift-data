Great Sports Bar not too far from where I stayed at while in Phoenix a few years ago.
Nice service and staff, beer selection is great.

My car was in a shop nearby and I looked for the closest bar to wait it out.
I did meet some really friendly company in this place and ended up having a good time.
First impression: the place is really really dirty.
I didn't want to drink out of my glass.
The bartender was MIA for the first 5 minutes and wasn't to quick to give me a refill either.
I came here because the other person that reviewed this place said it was a great sports bar.
I think The Sixth Sense was on the small TV and the food... well, if I didn't feel comfortable drinking out of my pint glass, I sure as hell wouldn't eat there.

This is the kind of bar that everyone turns around to see who entered.
Not comfortable atmosphere unless your from this side of town.
Two small tv sets at bar and not much else.
Skiperooni.
