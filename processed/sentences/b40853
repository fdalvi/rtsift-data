As good as it gets for fast food!
Great location across from Hilldale, healthy food, cilantro chips, and very good service.
The Sofritas (tofu, spicy) is fantastic.
The outdoor patio will be perfect in the summer!
As will the alcohol when they get their license.
I've been to 2 other locations on both coasts, all similar, all great and reliable.
Parking lot is a bit treacherous in snowy and/or icy conditions as it's on an incline.

I don't like chain restaurants, they lack personality and it isn't as good as if the owner was nearby, ensuring each item is served with a little slice of love.
With that said, this place just opened near me and it is pretty ok.
I won't be going daily for lunch, however it is open till 10pm and if I am late getting home or need dinner quick and on the fairly cheap this is a good choice.

I love all Chipotles and this location is no exception.
Best fast casual out there.
No surprises here, you will receive the same burrito, bowl or tacos you love and expect.
Seating options are fewer at this location compared to downtown and the East side, but I have never encountered a problem.

Usually you can't go wrong at any chipotle, and the first couple of times were pretty standard.
The last time I went, my wife and I realized the chicken was pink, undercooked.
We showed them and they didn't even offer us a free dish, a refund, and didn't tell anyone else that some if the chicken was undercooked.
They didn't even apologize and walked away from us just to remove the current bin of chicken.
Got to give them 1 star just for that.

I've been going here on an every other week basis for my work lunches, and I've got to say that it's great for everything that you'd expect from Chipotle's higher-end style and quality of fast food.
The burritos are stuffed nicely and the staff was great to me.
The only downside is that it gets really busy if you go during usual lunch and dinner peak times, so I end up not always having enough time to eat during the time allotted for my lunch.
I can't always blame the restaurant for that though.
In the end, if you're looking for some burritos or tacos quickly and made with good quality, this Chipotle should suit your needs.

Management at this location needs some work.
I have been to this location multiple times now as I love Chipotle, but this location is not run well.

This Chipotle was amazing until this week.
I have been twice this week and it has been unorganized and chaotic.
Earlier in the week they were out of chicken and today the grill wasn't working.
The guac has also changed and now tastes and looks store bought.
Please get it back on track!

Oh, Chipotle.
I want to really like you, maybe even love you, but I just can't bring myself to do it.
Your rice is mushy, your seasonings are bland, and your meat, while plentiful, is watery.
Your line cooks stare blankly at me and don't even ask me what I'd like to order.
They seem to be tuned into some other-worldly radio program that only they can hear.
I know that your commitment to ethical food production practices and fair treatment for food workers is so admirable and correct, and I love that about you.
You even have unsweetened ice tea, and writings by my favorite author Toni Morrison on your drink cups.
But Qdoba still has my heart.
It just...tastes better.
We can still hang out if no one else is available, k?
:-)

I love Chipotle.
Eat their all the time.
However this specific one is always unorganized, out of items, and typically the staff just doesn't listen.
