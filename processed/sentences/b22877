OMG!
Finally, I don't have to go to a stinky, sweat encrusted, dirty DMV to renew my registration or transfer a title!
If any of you have ever had a bad experience going to the DMV and gotten the run around...stop going there!
Courteous, knowledgeable, and most of all friendly staff and NO WAITING for hours on end!
That's right ladies and gents, I said no waiting!
All I did was walk in explained what I needed and voila...DONE!
Seriously, why go to the crappy DMV where you have to deal with disgruntled employees when you can actually get GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE?!
(Yes, it does exist!
)  Check them out and give them your business.
I guarantee you will leave with a smile on your face!

Need to get a automotive title put in your name?
Want to pay for your registration on your car?
Don't want to wait or go into the DMV?
We all hate waiting for things and if you live in Surprise you might have to wait awhile at DMV.
If I need to take care of registration and/or title on my car I go to West Valley Motor Vehicle.
It is located in the Crossroads shopping center.
It is right next to Subway and Radio Shack.
Both of which are tucked into the shopping center next to Goodwill.
This place is a time saver and have never waited a long time here.
It is a simple in and out usually.
Save yourself a headache at DMV and stop here.
