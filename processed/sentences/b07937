If you need some cheep yet fashionable accessories or clothing ladies look no further!
Forever 21 has everything you are looking for at low low prices.
They are one of the few cheep women's clothing stores that tries to emulate high fashion designs so you will find a lot of types of clothing here including a great variety of dresses.
They also always have great sales.
So it's even better when you find cheep cute clothes on the sales rack!
I wish there was one closer to my house!

Forever 21 is the absolute best place to find affordable, trendy clothes and jewelry/accessories.
While their products are not of the best quality, they have the largest selection and the clothes are extremely low priced!
It's a great place to go if you are just looking to buy a few things to spruce up your wardrobe without empyting your bank account.
And their jewelry is amazing - they have the funnest items for mostly $10 and under.
I love love love this store.
