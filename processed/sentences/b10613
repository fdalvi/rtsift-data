Dr Freedman saved my Marriage.
My husband had a heart attack which Contributed to his Erectile Dysfunction.
Dr Freedman suggested a Penile Implant by Coloplast.
I was all for it but my Husband was a little reluctant.
Dr Freedman suggested he talk to a patient who has a penile implant.
After they spoke about the procedure my Husband was all for it.
My Husbands self esteem has returned and we are enjoying the results.
I am truly indepted to Dr Freedman and his staff for Saving my marriage.

Great medical doctor!
I would highly recommend this doctor if you need  urologist!

Dr. Freedman is someone I would definitely recommend if you are looking for an expert in urology.

I give this place five stars the wait can be a bit much but that's because he takes the time to explain things and make sure you know what's going on with what he is providing great gals up front overall a great atmosphere and place to get the help I needed
