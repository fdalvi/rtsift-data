Brand new location in NE Mesa.
It's a great location close to Las Sendas & Red Mountain community.
Also, conveniently off the 202 Red Mountain Fwy.
Grand Opening Feb 8 & 9th 2014 and offering free classes.
Took advantage of the grand opening to see if I would like it.
It's brutal but the instructors are absolutely wonderful.
They guide you through the class with 2 instructors...one to show you the poses and the other assist with instructions.
They gave plenty of breaks and open the doors to cool off to assist us that were new to hot yoga.

I have done bikram yoga a few times before coming here.
And this place was a big change of pace.
It was more of a full workout than a mind/body connection you get with bikram yoga.
I still like bikram yoga but this faster paced, energetic style was a great change up.
They also play music the whole time, which really helps keep the intensity higher.
Great spot!

Fantastic!
Excellent workout, super nice friendly staff.
Been going for about 6 weeks.
Each instructor is terrific.
Selling the treadmill!
