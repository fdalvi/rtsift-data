Are you looking for top-quality takeout chicken wings that won't leave a hole in your wallet?
Wings Up in Waterloo is the place to go.
The self-described 'Best Wings in the Galaxy' does not disappoint with wings that are tasty and meaty with just the right amount of breading to soak up the sauce.
My standard order of 2 lbs of wings came fresh and fast and I was on my way in a jiffy.
My preference is for the honey garlic, but my friends who love the heat go for the Sweatin' Bullets.
The next time you are looking for wings to go in Waterloo, you'll want to pay Wings Up a visit!

Wing's up is a very solid option for Wings in Waterloo, they have a number of different flavours to choose from and different options for how they prepare the wings.
They do have other menu options but lets me honest, who goes to a place called Wings Up and orders a wrap?
The fries however are very good; crispy potato wedges seasoned to perfection.
My only complaint are the take-out containers,  they use a very cheap cardboard container with printed graphics on the outside.
It is kind of like wrapping your chicken wings in a freshly printed magazine, the wings heat up the cardboard and soak into it leaving you with a cancerous smelling, soggy box when you get home.
I'd recommend pouring the contents of the take-out box onto a plate as soon as possible.
Another concern is the price, a pound of wings and fries runs about $15.
Which at a nice sit-down restaurant makes sense, but at a take-out place It is hard to justify.
Other than that, great wings.

Best wings hands down.
Prefer them over Wild Wings.
My go to place when I'm in town.
Order was ready in less than 15min.
Staff was friendly and knew their stuff.
Brought friends and they all agreed.
Try them.... You will love this place.
