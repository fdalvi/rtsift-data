Oggies is as good as it gets.
Great place.
3 big screen tv's, great selection of cigars and great prices.
Great staff too.

I've been to a lot of cigar bars and this is my favorite by far.
Excellent place to have a smoke and spin some yarn.
Michael Jay, and Pete always have something to talk about.
Next door to an OTB if you want to have a smoke while you watch the ponies run as well.
Great selection of Padron 1926 and 1964 which is tough to find sometimes.
His prices are not crazy and they have all the things you need to enjoy a good cigar.
I would recommend this place to anyone.

I haven't smoked a cigar in a couple years but I still find myself coming in here from time to time to just relax and hangout with Michael and Pete.
What an awesome place with the best selection of cigars!

I came into Oggies since I was told it was one of the better shops in Scottsdale.
When I walked in I was greeted by one of the owners and asked if I needed help.
He was helpful in letting me know what they carried when I headed to the back they had a small selection and a lot of the cigars I liked had been sitting there for quite a while since they wrappers were brown and had dust on them.
They also didnt carry a few brands that I like but the owner stated he can get what ever I wanted which was good to know.
Overall its a cool little shop but not enough selection.
I did like that the staff was helpful though.

Went to Oggie's to get my husband a great cigar.
I was interested in the Padron maduros and they helped me select the perfect one for my husnband.
I got the 1964 anniversary edition and my husband loved it.
So glad I went to Oggie's no one else in the valley was so friendly and so informative in helping me make a great decision for the best cigar for my husband.
Great place & great staff!
