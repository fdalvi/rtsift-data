Excellent company specializing in distressed properties, short sales and problem properties.
Liz will do what it takes to get your property sold or find you just the right property if you are a buyer.

Liz and Her team at Liz Harris Realty go above and beyond to help their clients.
I have personally watched her help homeowners complete nearly impossible short Sale transactions to helping first time home buyers to realize the American dream of home ownership!
I would say if you are looking for an agent in the Phoenix, Scottsdale, Mesa, Tempe, Gilbert, Chandler, or surrounding areas Liz would be MY FIRST Choice!
Sincerely, Marc

I was in Arizona looking for an investment home and came to know of Liz Harris Realty by referral.
We had instant rapport and she showed me the best that Chandler, Gilbert and Scottsdale had to offer.
Real Estate, although I love the investment side, I need a-LOT of help on the technical side and that's where Liz and her team shined!
With enthusiasm they explained the latest trends and news that could effect my investments and helped me choose the right strategy going forward.
I can honestly say her knowledge is steadily making me a great profit and couldn't be more pleased with her service.
