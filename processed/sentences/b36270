Ah, Burger King on the base - because there aren't many other options.
Stopped here on a few occassions, typically when I'm on base with family.
BK is not high on my list of places I like to patron on the regular, but it will do in certain cases.
Perks - No tax.
Shares dining room with Popeyes.
Other customers are nice.
Dining room well kept and clean.
Cons - Employees seem... A little out of it sometimes?
On a recent trip the cheese on my Whopper wasn't even melted.
Prep of food could use improvement.
Why go?
You're on base and it's convenient.
But honestly I'd pick getting sandwiches or sushi at the commissary over BK 99.9% of the time.

Pretty average BK.
It shares a dining room with Popeyes so you'll have decent variety in the building.
The trash cans are always turned facing the walls for some reason, and the fountain drink machines don't always function, but overall it's not much different than any other BK.
