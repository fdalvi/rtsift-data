It has it's pros and cons.
Cute bartender tho

They have Smithwick's on tap!
Good place to catch games.

This is a locals place with what seems like an older crowd mainly 60 plus at least on St. Patricks Day.
It is your typical neighborhood dive with ok corned beef & cabbage.
They did have a band which was a plus even though they were the same age as the crowd here they were good and made the atmosphere of the place.
It's ok for a place to stop in for a drink.
The food was ok as well.
The waitress seems to e about the age of the crowd and is really not all there.
We said hello to her on the way in as we walked oases her and sat in a booth next to a table she was serving.
Needless to say, she never noticed us and we had to get up to get her to tell her we were here and wanted some drink & food.
If a crowd comes in like it happened here, forget about it....
