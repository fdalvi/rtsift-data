Dustin is the man.
The Smog Man.
I had to renew my registration and of course waited until the day before I leave the country to take care of it.
(I'm the Queen of Procrastination) Here's how the story goes.
First to do is get vehicle smogged.
IT DIDN'T PASS.
Zippity-fuckin-doo-dah.
Whelp, there goes all my vacation money on car repairs.
Looks like I will be eating ketchup packets for ten days in Europe.
Is it even called ketchup there?
Awesome.
NOPE.
Dustin "suggested" I do this and that and then drive 65 miles and come back to re-smog.
I was skeptical, but decided I know jack about cars so I would take his advice.
I did this and that and drove 65 miles to Searchlight and back just like Smog Man said.
Then I pull back into Jiffy where Dustin is waiting for me.
PASSED.
The rest of the renewal process was a cake walk.
Mission complete.
The moral of this boring ass story that contains no sex, drugs or violence is this: Jiffy Smog wants you to pass so screw the vampires and werewolves.
I'm Team Dustin.
I think his name was Dustin....
The End.

Need a smog, go see DUSTIN!!!!
He is the man.

Went in to get my smog during lunch a last week and it was quick and painless.
No one in line, so drove right up, dropped the car off and 10-15 minutes later I am paying.
The service tech was very nice, not the cold I hate my job kind of guy.
Smog only happens once a year but I would come back next year!

The smog attendant was very helpful and prompt about the service.

Quick and simple.
Dustin's a friendly guy and will have you on your way in no time.

I'm new to Henderson (finally escaped CA), and was looking for a diesel smog station.
Dustin took the time to look up an address that was close to me, even though I could hear he had customers lined up for his business.
NICE GUY!!

Fast service, polite employee, was in and out within five minutes.
Cost was $28, which is on the higher end of smog places.
