Upon walking into Office Max I felt I was entering a deserted business.
I mean seriously, I saw no one.. And I mean no one.. For a good 15 minutes!
I wandered the aisles in need of a rubber stamp pad to fit my wedding monogram .. Up and down the aisles.. Again.
Finally!!
Yay!
There's another human life amongst me..& he took me to my stamp area.
Check out was odd..
The girl was umboxing supplies on the check out area..& her manager acted like I just may be bothering their task for wanting to pay... Ok.. Get me outta here..

Slightly Eastern European in mood and appearance.
If I was a betting man, I would bet by the time you read this review that this location is closed.

Holy cow....
I walked in to this specific office max looking for a few simple office items.
When I began asking a member of the staff about a "top of the line binding machine", his response was "it's ok, I don't think it will break on you but it's not a good one".
Last thing a sales person should ever tell a customer.
I think the staff here needs refresher training in product knowledge and customer service skills.
Oh well....
There's always stapled.

If you like to waste your money-shop here for ink cartridges!
Of course needing to get a printing project in the mail the next morning I ran out of ink.
Thinking a quick trip to Office Max will take care of the issue, I'd quickly pick up the ink cartridges---I had purchased cartridges earlier this year from Amazon for $27 and Office Max charged $77!!
Needless to say I had to buy the cartridges from Office Max-from now on will order my cartridge sets from Amazon even if I don't need them immediately.
