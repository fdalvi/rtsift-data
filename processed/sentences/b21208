Great taste.
Wheat (not gluten)  free.
Low GI.
Wide range of flavours.
The cheese ones and the sweet ginger ones are great.
Available in most supermarkets as well as health shops etc.
BUT, they contain palm fruit oil which is unhealthy and environmentally unfriendly.
I have recently switched brands to one that uses olive oil instead.
