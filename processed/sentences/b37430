This particular Elements location in the Scottsdale Chaparral Plaza is like finding a calming, relaxing oasis here in the desert.
I love the upscale-looking lobby where complimentary chocolates and lemon-infused water are available to enjoy before or after your massage appointment.
Great extras there!
I experienced a wonderfully soothing and healing 55-minute relaxation massage from Neny who added in some much-needed reflexology to my hands and feet.
Neny was very good at getting the sore knots out of my neck and shoulders and she gave me the best scalp massage I've ever had.
I would highly recommend this Elements location and I look forward to going back on a regular basis.

Elements has several locations throughout Phoenix.
I was visiting over Christmas, and my family highly recommended them.
I was in pain with restless legs, so was very happy that I was able to get in on short notice.
They also offer special introductory rates for visitors, which they offered to extend if I wanted to book another treatment during my stay.
Overall, I was very happy with my massage and the therapist.
She worked out all of the kinks and I enjoyed the rest of my holiday pain-free.
I will definitely come back the next time I'm in Scottsdale.

Had a fantastic hot stone massage at Elements!
Excellent therapist, I felt like he listened to me and had great technique.
The spa is clean and very relaxing!
Pricing is also very reasonable, two thumbs up for Elements!
