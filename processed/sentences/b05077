I've been going here for years.
If you want soft fresh Mexican style ice cream this place is the place is the place for it.
They have several unique Mexican flavors.
While I don't think the mamey is the best it is still pleasant and a more approachable introduction to mamey flavoring which may be a but stronger to some.
The corn and the other snacks are also very good.
I would also recommend the raspados and the aguas as they are very good as well.
I'm a bug fan of their Tamarindo agua.
Would recommend to someone who wants to try a different, sweeter taste of Mexico.

I love La Michoacanas!
There are more than 1 of their kind.
The thing with this particular location is that as soon as you walk in their is a slight foul odor.
Why?
IDK!
I really love their ice cream it doesn't get better any better than this.
However I am inclined to write a review based of multiple experiences that I have had.
My most recent experience was very disappointing, I went in with my small children we ordered our ice cream and then the guy says "it is $1  to pay with credit or debit.
"  I felt horrible because I wasn't going to take the ice cream from my children mouth.
I do go on to ask the owner if there was a sign posted anywhere he said no.
I don't ever carry cash and if there was a sign posted I would've gone to another location.
The ice cream is great though.
Just highly suggest putting up a sign for extra charges.
