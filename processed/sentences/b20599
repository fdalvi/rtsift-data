Ah the Saton Tavern as it is affectionately known due to half the sign missing.
Pubs in Gorgie are actually pretty scary from an outsiders point of view.
I would say the Station Tavern is probably the best out of the few here.
It isn't strictly a Hearts pub which most are in the area and it offers live music, quiz nights and Wii games.
And free soup apparently.
A friend of a friend works here so we stopped here on a night out once and it was surprisingly okay.
The regulars are pretty friendly and the drinks weren't too bad.
It's not somewhere I will go often but it wasn't awful for that one occasion.

This place is a bit of alright!
Every time I pass this place, I think about the N that was stolen from the sign.
How it's probably perched on some jakey's mantelpiece, with all his bastard weans asking about it for years to come  Come Wii nights, trying to watch guys older than your grandpa monkey around of Wii Sports is worth the trip.
I've heard about the free soup but I've never been fortunate enough to witness this miracle.
Do they give you free bread too?

I have been here once or twice since taking up pub kareokes as a hobby and tend to find quite a cunning experience.
some real hilarious stuff has heppened if you've seen my station tavern kareoke video on youtube.
It used to be on Saturdays at the time but since doing the place up it's been a friday.
I've never been in the new building.
But judging from the service of the old building I rate this place 4/5 stars.
I have no idea of the new place as of yet.
To try out the new kareoke date it's on Fridays.
