Once I found Cosmopolitan Beads, I wasn't disappointed.
Sure the space is small, but if you're a beginner, it's just the right size to explore but not get too overwhelmed.
The owner was very nice.
She stopped a class she was teaching to show us around a little, even taking us to see her studio out back.
I can't wait to take classes here.
One improvement would be to make sure the website is up to date.
It still shows May's class schedule.
If you are an experienced beader and not easily overwhelmed, head to Scottsdale Bead, however if you are beginning, start here - you can't go wrong.
