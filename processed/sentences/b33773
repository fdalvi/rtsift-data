Cool place with nice gently used designer clothing for men and women.
Not a bad men's selection either which is not common.
My wife stopped in with about 10 of my shirts and some of her clothes and they gave us $60 cash which was enough to buy some jeans and a few shirts.
I'll start making this a regular stop to check it out since there were shirts for as low as $7 and designer jeans for $25!
Small little place is next to Heidi's deli on the NW corner of T-bird and 83 ave.

I have to say that I was pretty excited when I saw this place open up next to the children"s consignment shop.
Let's start with the positive, because that's the way I like it!
I have had two experiences with selling clothes and both times have been good.
I make sure the owner is there when I bring my items in.
Trust me on this.
They are fair with the prices, it is what it is.
I bring in as much as I can, this way your not making multiple trips for 18 bucks.
You can choose store credit or cash.
The store credit is always more than $cash$ and can be used at either resale shop!
I love this!!
The one star review is a bit harsh, I must say.
But, I do agree with the comments on the poor customer service given by the young ladies.
When the owner is not there, the store suffers in that department.
The ladies have never been rude to me, but I see a lot of room for improvement.
I want to say that the store is really well organized and clean.
Upgraded fixtures and wooden hangers make this place super chic and with great bargins to be found!

anytime I'm in the area I stop in to cop some gear!
great prices on top brands.
