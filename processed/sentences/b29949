This place just opened and is located behind Gangplank (where I work a lot) and Yoli's brought in some breakfast samples for us to try out - good stuff btw!
A handful of us (12) decided to go over for lunch and check it out.
Location is somewhat hidden in the little market just west of Arizona Ave and north and between of Frye and Chicago St.  Nice little older house looking place, with a nice patio that's shaded and enclosed in the little market area.
Inside is all redone and very clean with new tables and chairs.
They do take debit and have a soda machine for refills.
Food is very homemade American cafe/deli style with good burgers.
Currently since they just opened they don't have menus other than large notecards with today's menu, which works well actually.
Had about 10 different choices...
I went with the turkey bacon sandwich w/ American cheese on sourdough.
Very good no complaints at all.
It did take a little bit since we slammed them with 12 people right away on their first day but they held in and everything came out within a reasonable time and with no mistakes at all even with all the custom orders w/ the burgers we had.
They use little baskets for the food and have metal silverware.
OOOH and pickles... crisp too, not soggy and floppy :)  I had some time to talk to the two owners and they're very nice and personable and were more than happy we showed up even though we swamped them a bit.
Very nice ladies and without a doubt I and the rest of us at Gangplank will return frequently.
I say get down here and try it out.

I've had a number of meals here and never been disappointed.
It's definitely one of our go to places.
They do a nice breakfast burrito and a great burger.
Fries are also quite nice.
While we often do take out (with it being right next to Gangplank), I also like the ambiance of the cafe.
It's got kind of a cool, old style feel.
Staff is super nice as well.

Pretty good food.
Great service.
They do tacos and burgers really well.
Sandwiches are mediocre but the price isn't bad, so they are still a decent choice.
Good place for a quick lunch if you aren't wanting fast food or a full-on sit down restaraunt.

Very cozy little breakfast/brunch/lunch spot in downtown Chandler.
The closest cross streets for Yoli's are S Wall St. and Chicago, and visitors coming here for the first time may have a hard time finding it if they don't routinely shop in the little artisan craft plaza the restaurant is in.
Once you enter, you are greeted warmly by one of the family members.
We had brunch here, and left pleasantly full and satisfied.
The meals are a very good price for the portions given.
I was especially impressed with the carne asada burrito ($6).
The burrito was gigantic, encompassing the whole plate, with a side of delicious freshly made salsa and some sour cream.
The tortilla was grilled which gave a nice added texture to the meal.
They have a "choose your own breakfast" option which I tried ($6.50), which comes with 2 eggs, and then 3 different breakfast selections (such as French toast, pancakes, breakfast meats, different breakfast potatoes).
Everything was prepared fresh, tasted very good, and a nice option I found was that they had sugar-free syrup for those that didn't want regular syrup.
They also have pretty good coffee ($1.75), both hot and iced.
It is smooth and rich, no hint of bitterness.
If it weren't for yelp I probably would not have even known about Yoli's, but thanks to the wonder that is the internet I now have a good breakfast spot to go to when I want to start my day off right.

Been going to Yoli's since it opened..Love it!
I have been told by friends that they have the best hamburgers, so I finally broke down (since I'm not much of a burger guy) and tried one with skepticism.
I now think they need to change their name from Yoli's to YUMMY'S Cafe!
Holy cow (no pun intended) it was Awesome!
Has to be the juiciest most flaverful burger I can remember eating.
Not sure I can order anything else now.

Mom and Pop place a little off the beaten path in downtown Chandler.
That really sums it up.
The restaurant is located in an old house so you really do feel like you are sitting at someone's kitchen table having coffee.
We went in for a late breakfast on Saturday am.
I had a Monte Cristo breakfast sandwich and the hubby had the steak skillet.
Food was A-ok. Good coffee and a nice place to just take your time and read the paper since they were not busy at all.
The server was a little awkward but his mom explained that it was his first day working the front of the house.
Remember what I said about Mom and Pop?
I can't say this was the best meal I've had but it was pretty good and we will definitely be back simply because all the other breakfast places we like just have such a long wait on the weekends.
Also was an interesting visit since I never knew this shopping plaza existed even though we come to the main part of downtown Chandler regularly.
Two of the shops were out of business so I guess I am not alone.
I am going to write some reviews of the stores that are still open so stay tuned for that.... ;0)

Good pancakes and hash browns - with a generous portion size on the hash browns.
Also enjoyed the Monte Cristo.
Good service from the chef's husband.
Another nice touch was the fruit water - tasted like cantaloupe, very refreshing.

I love this place, the food is great and the ladies that work there and own it I assume, are so nice and friendly they make you feel right at home.
It has now become one of my regular stops.
Support your local cafes and quit going to the chains of restaurants.

yumyumyumyumyum!
Ok, I really like this place.
I've been searching for the perfect biscuit sandwich since I left North Carolina.
Yoli's has a delicious one that makes a Carolina girl happy in the morning.
It's so nice to have a place for a homemade breakfast just a hop, skip and a jump from the office.
If I ever stop obsessing over the biscuit sandwich (not likely), I want to try their breakfast burritos, skillets and french toast.
Word on the street is that those are amazing as well.
You can also walk here from Gangplank if you stop by to work and need some good food in your belly.
They serve lunch as well as breakfast, and I think they are open until 3.

Just got back from my second trip to Yoli's in less than 7 days.
That's how good it is!
My first trip was late on Saturday morning and I immediately fell in love with the outdoor patio/courtyard area.
It was a tad too hot to sit outside, so we opted to sit indoors.
We sat looking out over the patio and Yoli and Vanessa (owner/cook and waitress/front of house, from what I can gather) were immediately friendly and welcoming.
They specialize in breakfast and lunch and we got the carne asada skillet and the carne asada breakfast burrito.
I would have liked the burrito to be a little more spicy than it was, but they make their own pico and marinate their own carne, so it was still pretty yummy.
You'll also see later on, that they are totally open to customizations, because you can tell they aim to please.
Went back for lunch today and sat in the courtyard.
Such a beautiful area that is tucked away on the side of Arizona Avenue just south of the 'new' downtown Chandler.
Yoli came out and brought us a complimentary plate of apple crumble that she had made that morning - what a nice touch!
We got to talking about the menu and we found out that we have the same love for Spam that we picked up from our childhood upbringing.
She said that on Monday's they do Spam & eggs (with white rice) - which is one of my all-time favorite breakfasts... hard to find in a restaurant.
She said she didn't have the white rice at the moment, so then she got to thinking and decided to make me a Spamburger.
She did spam, melted american cheese, fried egg, and a grilled tomato on top on a burger bun.
MMM!
A new menu item totally made up on the spot, and it was soooo delicious.
She gave me a side of fresh fruit (apples, peaches, grapes), and served us pineapple infused water.
I love the "island" theme to their menu... they use a lot of pineapple in their dishes and insist on using fresh fruits.
So hard to find in restaurants nowadays.
My lunch buddies ordered the Cali Wrap with the Cole Slaw.
Can't speak for the wrap, except that it looked very yummy.
I got a taste of the slaw and it had a nice kick to it (from the green chili's or jalapenos they put it in).
I'm not a fan of cole slaw, but this was good and I would order it next time.
I'm excited to make Yoli's my new Go-to breakfast and lunch spot.
They don't get much traffic because of their location, but they've got everything going for them:  good atmosphere, good menu, good service.
I must confess, I like that they aren't so busy, because then I can really settle in and feel at home.
But I know they need to be busy to be successful, so I hope things start picking up for them.
I can't wait until November when they start opening up on Sundays!

Love supporting local businesses!
They have a good menu selection and variety of teas to choose from.
Service and prices are outstanding!

I eat here nearly every morning.
It's so refreshing to have a place that feels like home.
Yoli and company not only serve a great meal, but they know how to treat customers right.

Cute place, pretty easy to find.
The outside area is fairly small but we were able to get a table with no wait.
Greeted very friendly when we went in.
Good food; I had the chorizo burrito and hubby had the hearty skillet.
Those plus an iced tea and an orange juice came to $17 and some change and with the 10% off for checking in, it was $15 and change not including tip.
The only problem we had was the long wait times.
It took awhile to give our drink order, took awhile to get them, and it took a lot longer than expected to get our food after we ordered.
We'll be back though.

Went here yesterday after hearing fabulous comments about their food and Yoli.
Went for breakfast, had the biscuit and gravy side.
the biscuit was warm, flaky, and had a great taste.
The gravy itself was pretty decent.
I ordered the Carne Asada skillet breakfast.
It was delicious.
Potatoes were nice and soft not mushy like other places.
eggs were done just how i asked for them; over medium not over or undercooked.
the carne asada itself looked and tasted like it was a good quality beef.
Maybe flank steak.
Onions and peppers caramelized just right, nice touch with the avocado.
Chandler needs more places like this.
It is truly a hidden gem.
Plan on being a regular here since it is literally down the street from my work!
Also, you can't compete with those prices :)

This is my new favorite place to eat breakfast!
My fiance' and I were on our way to get some breakfast burritos.
We zigged instead of zagged, saw a sign and turned in to try it.
Yoli's is cozy, with a great group of employees.
I had the hamsteak, country potatoes, and two eggs over medium.
The fiance' had a chorizo and egg burrito, and we both had coffee.
Both dishes were simple, but very good, to include the coffee.
The fiance' let me have a bite of her burrito and it is definitely one of the best chorizo and egg burritos that I have ever had, and I have ate a lot of them.
The best part of all are their prices.
Super cheap for the quality and quantity of food that you get.
Before this morning, if my fiance' and I wanted a light breakfast to start our Sundays it would usually be either breakfast burritos from a taco shop or we would go to The Coffee Shop in Gilbert.
Now we have the quality of The Coffee Shop (if not better), but without the high prices of The Coffee Shop.
I look forward to trying their skillets and biscuits  and gravy.
If you are just now hearing about this place go a try it for yourself.
You will not be disappointed.

Awesome Monte Cristo!
Staff is super friendly.
Yoli's Cafe is so good that I had to make a yelp account just to write a review and recommend it.
5 stars all around.

I found this little hot spot on Yelp and used my phone to navigate me there; I wouldn't have found it otherwise.
This small establishment is hidden in a neighborhood right off of Historic Downtown Chandler.
It's a quaint little diner with modest décor.
I felt very comfortable there and the service was fast and friendly.
As I looked over the menu the first thing I saw was the Morning Monte and havarti cheese as one of the ingredients.
Cheddar isn't better; it's all about havarti folks!
I needn't look further; I knew that's what I was having.
Hawaiian bread French toast, bacon, turkey, egg and the havarti - absolutely delicious!
Can't wait to come back and bring everyone I know.

After a morning workout I was starving and did a search on best Breakfast Burrito in Chandler: Yoli's came in near the top and I had never heard of it.
I stopped in and met Yoli who walked me through the menu.
when I was indecisive between he carne asada or chorizio, she recommended a combo.
One word: AMAZING!
Fresh pico with jalapenos, light cheese, and marinated beef/sausage were a perfect combination.
The spot is well hidden (which may hurt in the long run), but the place is spotlessly clean and charmingly cute.
Asian chairs, black counter tops, and a warm feeling make this place my new breakfast place!

What can say?
Believe the hype!
This mom and pop gem is truly a destination for serenity and great food.
Like many others I went with the "Mornin Cristo".
It was equally balanced in sweetness and savoryness.
I had my egg over-easy  to make it a little more richer.
The Spicy Orange Marmalade compliments it perfectly; for those who don't like a sweet and spicy kick you can also eat it with regular syrup.
The coffee was smooth and velvety , I didn't even have to use sugar.
The service was friendly but not overly bearing.
I ate in the courtyard facing the water fountain it was so peaceful.
The prices are so low and didn't feel the need to use the 10% check-in offer through Yelp.
I will definitely go back here again.

Went to Yoli's for a late breakfast with some friends last weekend.
We wanted to go eat someplace that wasn't the usual Denny's/Ihop/Good Egg.
This place was a nice change.
It's a quaint hole in the wall joint on a little side street in downtown Chandler.
I had the Monte which was a great breakfast sandwich of ham, Havarti cheese and an egg (I had mine scrambled) between Hawaiian milk bread French toast and lightly dusted with powdered sugar.
They give you this spicy marmalade on the side and when you spread it on the sandwich, it gives it a nice flavor.
Really tasty, definitely recommend.
My friends had the chorizo skillet that had country potatoes, an egg, cheese and chorizo.
They serve pico on the side along with tortillas.
They really enjoyed it.
Good food, easy on the bank!

Ok, we came here for a late lunch.
Definitely need to try the b-fast instead.
We had the pulled pork & the shroom burger.
The pulled pork is one thing that she's known for.
The flavor of it is great, but the pork itself wasn't as tender as I would have liked.
I love the kick in it though.
They usually serve it on a roll, but the day we had it we had it on a bun.
That was dee-lish.
The bread was sweet and light.
Me likes :)   The shroom burger was favored by both of us.
Try it!
I appreciate that the server double checked with us and made sure that we knew that the shroom burger was actually just a portobello mushroom and not a hamburger w/shrooms.
We knew, but I thought it was a kind gesture.
I'm determined to come back and try the breakfasts though!
If it wasn't for that, I'm not sure I love it enough to come more often.

Go to court.
Eat good food.

I would have never found this place had it not been for yelp.
It definitely is hidden but very cute.
The husband had the chorizo burrito and I had the carne asada burrito.
Both were great!
I want to return for the morning monte cristo... Looks delicious!
Prices are more than fair and this place is a great alternative to the chain breakfast places.
Give it a try and support local businesses!!!

Delicious place for breakfast!
It is a hidden gem tucked away in the neighborhoods next to downtown Chandler!
Awesome breakfast food!
Very friendly, personable service and great decor inside and patio/ garden outside!
The menu prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get.
The skillets are excellent!!
Definitely check it out :)

Seemed a little chaotic as they pack a lot of eaters in a small place.
Some small issues were present like a forgotten water and running out of flavored creamer.
Cozy place however although I'd try to snag a chair if I were you and not a stool.
Service - As I mentioned, server was a bit busy and running around like crazy.
Apparently there was a coupon that folks were taking advantage of and they didn't expect such a rush.
Even when running around though, she did her best to make sure we were ok.   Food - I ordered the green eggs and ham omelette plus I added tomatoes and it comes with a side of potatoes plus grain.
Wife ordered a belgian waffle with blueberries and strawberries.
Both of us ordered coffee; it was fresh and had a nice smoky taste.
Food took about 30 minutes.
Food was pretty standard for a place like this.
I would highly reccomend getting the green eggs and ham omelette with pepper jack (you can add tomatoes as well).
Food felt like it had been in the pass for a while.
Overall though, the flavors were good.
Price - We got all listed above for 17.60 plus tip.
I'd say that I'd quite a good deal for the large portions.
I'd give Yoli's 4 stars based on friendly service, good coffee, feel and price.
Food is as good as any other little mom and pop diner.
Nothing stood out, but nothing dissapointed.
Will be going back!

I did not want to get all hyped up over the reviews about this place.
All too often they will paint a picture in my head which just cannot live up to reality.
This is something I am working on.
I quickly perused the star ratings, and hurried out the door, excited for breakfast.
My friend and I were politely greeted & seated.
I saw the first item on the menu.. the "Mornin Monte" .. sold!
I ordered it with my coffee, forcing my company to let go of his indecisiveness.
He regretfully blurted out, "Errrr.. Ughh.. Combo: eggs, hashbrowns, french toast, fruit bowl" What a pussy!
So that was it..
Seated, orders in, coffee cooling.. all within 3 minutes after parking.
So we sat.
We listened to a group of elderly women discussing their kidney problems, admired the hickey just below our waitress' right ear.
We smiled at a baby going crazy on a bowl of fruit with strawberries in it, and cringed over the girls next to us complaining about their struggles at the office.
Actually, it was one girl griping, and the other sporadically inserting "yeah" here and there.
(I thought: bitch, its Saturday.. chill out!
)   We sat some more.
Patiently.
For about 45 minutes!
The Golden Girls had gone.. leaving us with the 2 unhappy hipster chicks..
Finally!
Our food!!
The wait was ridiculous, so in order to get me back in there.. this Monte had to hit the spot.
It didn't.
Not even close.
It's a french toast sandwich with egg white, turkey breast, turkey bacon, havarti, and some spicy marmalade.
Honestly, minus the marmalade.. this thing was bland as fuck.
The french toast egg mixture could use sprucing up.
Maybe throw some fresh herbs into the egg white too?
I dunno.
It wasn't impressive in my opinion at all.
Daniel's eggs and hashbrowns were eggs and hashbrowns.
He agreed the french toast was wack... and those strawberries the little girl was macking on.. the ones that made him say, "Fruit Bowl!"..
ya, those were nowhere to be found.
In fact, there were only grapes in there.
Weird right?
Service was great.
The big guy who took my money at the end was very cool.
I just don't like waiting 45-50 minutes for ho hum food..
Sorry Yoli's, you were a disappointment.

Very nice little place with pleasant decor and a small patio for dining outside in the shade.
6 stars for friendliness!
The owners and their employees give new meaning to nice as they greet all as if they were old, dear friends.
Food was solidly good if not great.
I had the green eggs and ham and while good it had a bit too much green which drowned out any other flavors.
Had a very nice biscuit  with a good crumbly texture and buttery flavor.
Hashbrowns were well browned and of good quality.
My wife had the bagel with eggs, spinach and Havarti and it was very tasty.
My wife is a very good cook and her comment was that it was "just like she would have made it herself".
High praise indeed.
All in all a good place to which we will return.

What a difference a day can make!
Yesterday my wife and her friends stopped at Yoli's for breakfast on the way to the Gem Stone Show in Tucson.
When she came home and she said we have to go back, that she really had enjoyed her breakfast.
So this morning I agreed to give it a try.
I'm a big fan of locally owned joints and always try to support those verses chain restaurants.
Yoli's is off on a little side street in downtown Chandler.
It's in a converted little bungalow that features some other little shops in a common courtyard.
When we walked in, 9:30ish, there were some tables available and a waitress walked by and told us to sit wherever we wanted.
Around the same time several other couples came in and seated themselves.
Customers around us seemed to be enjoying their meals and from what I could see they looked good.
We continued to see wait staff running around but nobody was acknowledging us, they could have said' "sorry, we'll be with you in a moment".
Now my wife is getting perturbed, I'm normally the one that says I'm outta here after 10 minutes but today for some reason I was being the voice of reason.
Finally after 18 minutes the same waitress comes by and asked if we have looked a menu yet, we didn't have any yet, we have no beverages or silverware - nothing!
She comes back with 1 and says that they don't have any extra menus and could we share this one.
Still hasn't asked us if we would care to have anything to drink.
After she finished serving the table next to us she then asks if we would like anything to drink, finally!
She comes back with our coffee and waters and she takes our order.
When my wife inquires about the potato choice we are told that they are out of the country potatoes today.
Its mid-morning and you are running out of potatoes already?
Ok, so we get our ordered placed and start to enjoy our coffee.
In the mean time I'm noticing 2 couples sitting outside and they have been waiting at least 15 minutes and no one is acknowledging them, you can see them looking around to see if they can flag down help.
When they finally wait on them we notice that they are getting their coffee in paper cups.
Then we hear another waitress tell the four top next to us that they have run out of coffee cups and hope they don't mind the paper ones.
My wife says they never had to wait the day before, which they had great service and the food was out in descent time.
Not so today.
It's now been 40 minutes since we placed our order, the waitress comes out to the table next to use to ask who ordered the Steak & Peppers Skillet, they reply that isn't our order, the waitress turns and looks at us (mind you now, she took our order) and says I wonder who ordered this.
I said that I also ordered the Steak & Pepper Skillet and she says they wrote the wrong table number on the slip.
(It was you honey) She then hands me a menu and ask if I would like to order something else, that they are out of Carne Asada for that meal.
This tells me that the cooks aren't checking what is being ordered until they are preparing that meal or the waitress is not in tune with the kitchen.
Either way that was the final straw for me.
We left and I'm disappointed for them.
You have to take care of your customers in a timely manner.
I could have over looked running out of some of the ingredients but not 40 minutes after you have taken my order.
Someday, if you last, I will try you again.
Good luck Yoli's!

Today my friend and I decided to have brunch at u.s egg, but I figured I would try and find something better on yelp.
Being close to his home I saw the reviews for yoli's and decided to check things out.
Upon arrival, we noticed several empty tables on the patio, and many inside, we decided the patio would be nice.
We were seated by the hostess and ordered coffee which was served quickly.
Our creamer was a little low so my friend actually went to an empty table and got more.
Upon his return another couple had entered and was seated at that table where he had taken the creamer.. We snickered when we overheard that table ask for more creamer when they ordered their coffee but went along deciding what to order.
5 minutes go by and the waitress took that same tables orders before us.
Ok, no biggie, but then she never returned to take ours.
Another 10-15 minutes goes by and we start talking about how when we finish our coffee we should just leave.
Well, that time came, and as we started to shift out of our chairs, the waitress rounded the corner and asked if we were ready to order.
By then, I forgot what I was having and my friend had stated we were just going to leave but requested the manager.
We went back inside and the waitress said, "please wait, the manager is helping the cook with these orders.
" now mind you, the place at that time only had 3 tables with customers.
One had already been served.
We stated we have waited way too long to wait around for the manager/owner, and walked out.
Upon our exit from the door, the rude waitress was snickering to the host, "good, we don't need your kind of people here"... We both heard it, did a 180 and confronted the statement.
"what was that supposed to mean?
" about this time the owner stepped out because the commotion had filled the empty dining space.
"how long have you been waiting" she stated, as if she's ran into this scenario before.
We stated 15 minutes minimizing the time that we really had spent.
The owner was about to comp our meal but the aggressive rude waitress was spouting that we were not skipped in service and we had just been seated.
In which we pointed out we have had time to finish our coffee in the time we've waited.
When owner asked the hostess who was seated first, she agreed with the waitress.
Which we even stated we took the creamer off the empty table that was ordered before us.
No use in arguing any further we left.
Our presence was known at least by the other customers eating outside.
I never in my life had been treated like a 2nd class citizen.
Did I mention, we're both gay...
So the comment "we don't need your kind of people here" really takes it to a whole new level.

Met a friend for Sunday brunch and sat at a table outside.
The atmosphere was outstanding, quiet and peaceful.
I had the sausage and cheese omelet that came with a biscuit and hash browns, all smothered with white gravy.
All I can say is, "Incredibly delicious!
"   Yoli herself waited on us and was wonderful.
No waiting to be seated, served or for coffee refills.
One of the best dining experiences I've had in a very long time.
We are new customers for life.
What a find, thanks to yelp.

Friendly owners take great care of you.
The chorizo burrito is excellent, I enjoy having an occasional breakfast here.
The location is a bit tricky to find a block off of Arizona Avenue on Wall Street.
Be sure to track this place down and give it a try.

I find the apology from the owner, a little different than the e-mail he actually sent me on march 5th.
I'll let you decide... Hi Teddy,  rick s. has sent you a message on Yelp:  Your Review  "Teddy I do appreciate your feedback, however there are 3 sides to every story yours, ours, and the truth..Yoli explained the situation to me as it escalated after she came out to talk to you and your friend..
I do agree that our server was inappropriate with the comment she made referring to you and your friend being Loud and Making a Scene in Public, nothing to do with being gay, how would she even know?
Yoli says that your friend repeatedly told her you waited 10 mins not 15..Maybe the wait was to long for your taste since you were really hungry.
It was a beautiful morning and enjoying the patio and the beautiful garden it what people do.
Possibly taking the other tables order was an oversight, You stated that since you waited to long you were going to leave and not pay your bill for the coffee, that Teddy is theft and you would never do that if you where in a store and the line was too long so you just walk out with a drink, right?
The server more than wanted to accommodate you after you made a fuss, including my wife.
Regardless if there were 3 tables or 30 tables full, learn to have patience.
Yoli was busy in the kitchen helping make 2 large to-go orders, many things you don't know happen in a restaurant.
We both have Family and Friends that are part of the LGBT community and we nor our employees would ever discriminate against anyone.
The whole new level of 2nd class citizen was really Amplified by your friend calling my wife a Wetback which you failed to mention in your review.
He should be ashamed of his actions.
We care about and even love our customers which you could still be, as we invite you and your friend back for breakfast or lunch and we both can make some apologies and have a better day.
Please respond when you have had time to read this and maybe cool off.
Thanks Rick and Yoli"

Whaaaaaat!
We love breakfast out and this is such a great little find in downtown Chandler!

Downtown Chandler's best kept secret!
Yoli's is an awesome cafe for casual dining with great food and service.
I highly recommend the breakfast skillets, they are delicious, and provide plenty of food to satisfy the heartiest of appetites.
Staff is very friendly and attentive, you can't go wrong with Yoli's!

Great breakfast place.
Cozy, and fresh food!
Went there last week and it was great!

We found this place on yelp and for a second there we could not locate it.
Keep looking, its there.
It is definitely a hole in the wall and if it weren't for the service, we would have given it a 5.
There was 1 waitress for all the tables during lunch rush.
We had the monte cristo and the luau sandwich.
Both were delicious.
Only suggestion- add some cool options to the kids menu.
We will be back!

Really enjoyed our breakfast here.
My french toast was great (not soggy), the coffee was good, everyone else enjoyed the breakfast.
Our favorite part was the little communal garden and sitting outside.
The kids had a great time walking around the garden, looking at the plants, sculptures and the birds.
Our waitress was wonderful and we appreciated the Yelp deal.
Just note my tip - from the outside, looks like a residential block, but the restaurant is in the back in the quaint courtyard.

Despite the modest appearance from the street, Yoli's is a real find.
Thank you, Yelp!
While visiting PHX, and lost and hungry, I searched Yelp for the closest breakfast place.
We parked with some trepidation.
Walking through the gate, we entered breakfast heaven.
Great food, awesome service, good coffee.
If I lived in Phoenix, I'd eat here multiple times a week.

Yoli's Cafe delights and delivers!
Awesome biscuits & gravy, really tasty french toast, and a delightful location.
This tiny little cafe is tucked into a neighborhood setting, attached to old downtown Chandler.
I have had breakfast and lunch at the cafe and am happy with all the food I had.
My first day, I ordered the hearty skillet and was pleasantly surprised by their delicious biscuits and gravy.
I actually ordered the gravy on the side as I am not always a fan of biscuits and gravy, but this stuff was AH-MAZE-ING!
I waddled out of the restaurant a happy camper, especially at the low prices they charged (even before the yelp check-in 10% discount!
)  The next time I went I tried the french toast.
I am somewhat of a french toast snob, and yet... they did not disappoint.
It was golden and delicious with a touch of sweet.
The sausage they serve at Yoli's is also fantastic!
I was super delighted and again, left happy and full!
On my third trip, I arrived a bit too late for breakfast, but my girlfriends and I decided to try out their lunch menu.
My friend and I had the monte cristo, and my other friend had a beef sandwich.
We were all happy with our sandwiches, though I could have wished for a side of fries or cole slaw to come with the cristo.
My friend ordered onion rings rather than fries to go with her beef sandwich and this was a superlative move; the onion rings were crisp and tasty.
The only downsides I've experienced is that if the place is busy you could be waiting for quite a while to get your food; if you prefer to sit outside, you may be in the sun; and the place is very small so it fills up fast.
However, the menu here has certainly delighted me, the staff are very friendly, and the atmosphere is beautiful.
You really couldn't ask for much else!

We went here for the first time and were very pleased with our experience.
The French toast was delicious, and my husband had the veggie burrito.
All ingredients tasted very fresh.
We also really enjoyed the staff.
They were very friendly and very accomodating.
We will definitely be back because we want to try the lunch.

Hmmm, let's see... when was the last time I went to the same place for breakfast 3 days in a row before Yoli's?
NEVER!!!
Fantastic food, great service, great prices, cool outdoor seating.
You MUST try the french toast, and biscuit/gravy.
yeah, I usually don't get those together either, but then I'd never been to Yoli's...

Loved our first visit here!
Good thing we mapped the spot because it would definitely be easy to miss given it's on Oregon in a residential neighborhood just W of AZ Ave.  We were quickly seated in their outdoor patio.
The weather was fair and breezy, so it was a good option to be outside.
Patio furniture is plain and decor is sparse, but the friendliness of the staff and the anticipation of some yummy food kept us happy.
Our order did take a bit long to fill (the friendly server gave us a heads up on that before we waited too long or got frustrated), but when it came, I thoroughly enjoyed my green eggs and ham, Sam I am!
My hubby got the Morning Monte and enjoyed it but not as much as he liked the bite from my green eggs and ham (he said mine was definitely much tastier).
The meals were very filling and at 18$ for breakfast for two - I like that!!
I will definitely come again as their other omelets and burritos looked worth trying.

Yoli's has recently been popping up on Yelp's 'Best Of' front page.
Many people are mouthing out and as the food whore that I am, I needed to go out and try it for myself.
My previous research told me that there were many 5 stars and 3 stars reviews regarding the ambiance, service and food.
It seemed that the place had be 5-stars for a while but trending analysis showed a decline in the late 2011- early 2012.
Alright enough nerd talk-  it was a Saturday morning, I was starving and I needed a place to have brunch with my lady friend in town.
When it comes to brunch at Yoli's, you really need to leave all your expectations at the door.
The neighborhood its in is a little sub-par, the parking situation isn't grand and the interior and patio decor resembles a home that stopped paying for landscaping services a long time ago.
The tables outside are all basic basic plastic, they are not squeaky clean (or perfectly leveled) and the seating is pretty limited.
If you are coming to Yoli's, you are coming here for the food and nothing else, this ain't no brunch at the Four Seasons.
Their menus are strictly breakfast/brunch related but at a 2-sided page list, their breakfast choices do have a large variety of flavors and prices.
The food is on the stealthier side with skillet dishes, omelets and diner-style potato sides.
My friend and I ordered their most popular dish, the El Monte- Hawaiian french toast sandwich filled with egg whites, turkey, bacon and cheese with a 'spicy orange marmalade'.
At about $7, the sandwich was pretty large and filled me up easily after just half of it.
The french toast itself was soft and spongy and the bacon had some crisp, but the turkey was very thinly-sliced deli meat so it didn't have a lot of flavor and the spicy marmalade was tasty but not spicy at all.
The service was a tad slow but the lady was very very courteous and nice to us, she just didn't stop by very often so we had to wait around for our drinks and our check for quite a while.
Overall I wasn't blown away with Yoli's but I would recommend as a place with decent portions and good prices.
As of now, a 3.75 stars on my book.
I am a big supporter of local restaurants and I love seeing a family-owned business thrive.
With a little bit more decor, faster service and a cleaner environment this place can return to be the GEM that people used to talk about.
Yoli, if you are reading this- I hope you take this advice, we all want to see you succeed so we hope you can get back on that horse and impress the hell out of us.
Good Luck!

I've never had such a mouth watering craving for food like I do for Yoli's breakfast.
This place is my #1 favorite place to eat in Phoenix.
You get great food in a friendly unpretentious atmosphere.
The food is absolutely amazing.
And the prices are very good.
For a wonderful meal in a great environment definitely visit Yoli's.
Try the morning monte You'll love it.

It's a great little spot!
The owner even came out to ask how I'd like my smoothie.
Super sweet people.
Cools spot and I love to support a local business

YUMM!
No wonder why this place won awards!
The service and food were amazing!
Their prices are pretty good too.
The neighborhood that its in isn't ritzy (there's a tattoo shop next door), but it's still a great little hidden gem.
Unlike a lot of the chains out there, Yoli's will really appreciate your business.
(Try the Monte Crisco, it's delicious!

I really love this restaurant!
I discovered it here on Yelp when I was looking for somewhere for my boyfriend and I to go for breakfast/brunch.
The first thing I like is that it's hard to find: I don't think I'd have ever found it if I wasn't looking.
Depending on if you exit through the front or back, it's like two different neighborhoods.
The second thing I like is the atmosphere.
The square the building sits in is very "quaint"... that's the best word for it.
It's a few old houses turned in to business, including a stamp shop.
There's a ton of cool landscaping happening in the middle, complete with an enclosure of birds!
Everyone is really friendly, there is awesome outside seating, and just good service.
Lastly, of course, is the food.
It's nothing extravagant, it's your usual breakfast food and combos, but it tastes like it just came out of my grandma's kitchen.
The pancakes are really good... and that says a lot because I usually won't eat pancakes.
One small touch I appreciate is that they provide flavored creamers, not just original half-and-half.
The coffee is good on its own, but I like a little flavor.
There's no doubt we'll continue to frequent this hidden gem!

Visit - 5/26/201  Indeed...a potenential hidden gem!
Food was decent, but wait staff was very good.
I got the steak skillet, son#1 the Denver omelet, son #2 the hearty skillet.
I am not a food critic, but the steak skillet was a bit bland, but it looked really good.
The home-style potatoes were really good.
Only major complaint was the time it took to get our food, else, it would have been 4 stars.
I think this was due to the nice weather and there were a lot of people that morning.

I really really wanted to love this place...
I live within walking distance and saw a nearly 5 star review.
Unfortunately my visit had not only what would be considered slow service but rather no service.
I had to ask for every refill we received for breakfast, and ended up having to wait for our check for almost a half hour.
I will go back because of the great low prices as well as the quality of the food.
I hate to give a low score to a local joint with such an amazing potential, especially given the fact that service is rarely an issue.
I will go back but will leave this 3 star until then.

Excellent food and ambience.
The service was good and the garden with all the birds is wonderful.
It was nice finding this hidden gem in Chandler!
We will definitely be back soon.

Got the Morning Monty and the Steak Buritto!
Very good.
Cute little place.
Staff was very nice.
Wish they served local or organic options though.
I dig the location and it was fun to try a new place, but I usually steer clear of non-organic food.
That's the only reason I gave them 3 stars.

I'm beyond impressed with the quality of food that Yoli's Cafe has to offer.
My girlfriend and I were immediately greeted by all of the staff when we walked into the restaurant and we were able to pick our own seat.
After looking through the lunch menu I chose the Monte Crisco and my girlfriend chose the Carne Asada Tacos.
The Monte Crisco was perfect!
The french toast bread was fresh and there was plenty of ham stacked on the sandwich.
Without asking, I was given both regular syrup and there homemade Chipotle Marmalade on the side.
The Marmalade was amazing and I will definitely tell them to put it directly on the sandwich next time.
My girlfriend LOVED the Carne Asada Tacos.
The ingredients were very fresh and they didn't hold back on the amount of meat in the tacos.
On the side she got Mexican Cold Slaw and this amazing side of re-fried beans that had a hint of beef and cheese.
After we finished our meal, one of the owners came out, sat down next to our table and asked us how we liked everything.
He told us a little bit of the history behind the restaurant and the area that surrounded it.
I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is tired of the franchise restaurants and who enjoys family/mom and pop joints.

We arrived separately after taking incorrect turns in downtown Chandler, ordered on three different checks, complained about how customer service in this country is lacking on so many levels and then we had breakfast at Yoli's!
Get thee-self over here straight-away.
They have been serving up delicious breakfasts for 18 months now and this is the first I've heard of them.
I need to get out more often.
Pancakes, waffles, eggs, breakfast sammies, omelettes, skillets, biscuits ... need I go on?
Friendly and personable service with smiles and helpful can-do attitudes.Good food served to order hot and yummy.
Inside seating, garden seating, your choice, your way.
I love a place that goes above and beyond to make my day a special one.
Thank you Yoli's for reminding me that there is goodness and deliciousness all rolled into one place right here in Chandler, Arizona.

Great spot.
Fantastic service and delicious food.

The French toast on my sandwich for lunch was absolutely delicious!
However, I cannot say I am a fan of the monte cristo.
French toast to me needs to be seperate from eggs.
I love me some good french toast.
I figured Id give it a shot.
Just not my thing all together.
I ate everything separate from one another.
My boyfriend loved his pastrami sandwich he said.
I cannot wait to go and try breakfast!

We found Yoli's Cafe searching for locally owned breakfast joints in Chandler and based on the reviews we decided to try it.
We went on Sunday around 11am.
The Cafe looks like an old house that was converted into a small restaurant and there is a garden growing in the courtyard.
The place is small, clean, and cute   We were able to be seated immediately but we ended up waiting an hour for our food.
This normally might seem like a con, but once you get the food on a busy Sunday morning you know exactly why.
It is fresh, hot, and delicious!
Best breakfast I have had out in a very long time.
I had the Garden Skillet with Country Potatoes & cinnamon raisin toast.
My boyfriend had the Chorizo buritto.
The skillet had fresh veggies, fluffy eggs, and fresh country potatoes.
It was YUMMY!
The cinnamon raisin toast was so good!
My boyfriend stole a piece because it was that tasty.
His chorizo burrito had hash browns in it and he said it was amazing, one of  best he has had.
We also had Mexican cokes in the bottle.
Yea real sugar!
My only criticism was that I wished we would have known how long it would take to get our food, an update at 45 mins or so I think would have helped.
Once the food did come though, I forgot about any impatience!
Our waitress said Sunday is there busiest day.
The price was fair.
Breakfast for two was $20.
We will be back repeatedly.

I tried out Yoli's this past weekend for the first time.
We arrived around 10AM on Saturday and were able to sit down right away.
We reviewed the menu and asked the waitress for suggestions.
The waitress said we must try the french toast as it is the most popular item.
I'm a fan of a good old American breakfast which is eggs, bacon, country potato's (with onions, peppers, and jalapenos), and pancakes which is what I ordered.
My wife ordered the same however she ordered french toast instead of pancakes.
Once we ordered it took around 45 min to get our food which was odd because there were only 8 patrons and 4 already had their food.
The eggs, bacon and potato's came first and it was not a good first impression.
The 2 pieces of bacon were ~3 inch long and the eggs did not look very appealing.
The country potato's did look good and they tasted very good also.
The highlight of our breakfast was the pancake and french toast, they were good enough to almost forget about how long the wait was and how unimpressed we were with everything else.
If I go again I will get the pancakes only.

Hey, you reading this deciding whether or not to give this place a try - DO IT!
Oh man, the hawaiian french toast was amazing; didn't even need syrup!
It's a cozy place and it feels kind of crammed, but overall, the food was great and the service was very friendly.
I will definitely be back!

I have been thinking about trying Yoli's since i saw them on a morning news segment!
However it was very disappointing.
I had the carne asada burrito and my man had a the monte crisco sandwich and a side of potatoes.
The burrito was very bland and has a strange after taste.
After trying the other dishes, I realized that all the food had the strange after taste...
I did not finish my meal...
I've had better at filly b's.
I will most likely not return.
It was also uncomfortably warm in the restaurant.
There are some amazing breakfast places around....
It's unfortunate that Yoli's doesn't make the grade in my opinion.

Food is amazing!!
The wait time for food is way too long.
But the quality of the food almost makes it worth it.

What can I say about Yoli's cafe...  ooh that rhymed!
Enough rhyming.
Would never have found this place if not for yelp and my normal Saturday ritual of typing breakfast/brunch into the search option to see where the internet is going to send me to fill me up with breakfast goodies.
When I saw a place in Downtown Chandler that was both reviewed as delicious and inexpensive, that's when my search that day ended.
Popped that address into GoogleMaps on my phone and away we go.
"In a quarter mile make a left turn," says my phone in that lovely monotone robot voice reminiscent of a test proctor in grade school.
Are you sure Google Lady?
That looks like houses...  "Make a left turn!
"  Ok ok ok, I believe you.
Don't have to yell at me.
Oh dear, where are you taking me phone?
Another quick right turn and we are clearly in a neighborhood and right as I about to turn around... "Your destination is on the right.
"  Oh wait!
It is!
Walking through the doors, I wasn't too sure if I was walking into a restaurant or someone's house.
That's ok though because it smelt heavenly and based on the amount of people in their, this was a restaurant or the home of a really hospitable homeowner who liked to cook.
We were promptly offered a place to sit and given menus.
Phew, it is Yoli's.
I ordered a cup of coffee and an egg skillet.
And dear lord in heaven above, I swear i heard angels singing when it was being carried to my table.
Too dramatic?
I may have let out an audible, "Oh Yeah!
" similar to that of the Kool-Aid guy though.
Eggs we're cooked to perfection and and coffee kept flowing.
The waitress was very kind and prompt with everything.
It is a definite family feel here at Yoli's.
Did I mention my bill was less than $15 for breakfast for both me and my girlfriend!
Give them a try down at Yoli's!
Trust me, you'll love it.

Looking for breakfast or lunch?
Eat here.
Cafe food with a Yoli twist.

Found this place hidden away in downtown Chandler.
Great breakfast and lunch.
Help staff are good and the food is excellent.
Cannot wait until the weather cools down so I can eat outdoors.
Great atmosphere.
Think you ought check this place out.

I came here hoping to catch brunch but I guess it ends at 11:30am or 12pm.
Luckily the lunch menu looked just as tasty.
We ordered the Luau pulled pork sandwich (the jalapeno cole slaw gives it a nice kick) and the Monte Cristo (french toast instead of regular bread slices = delicious).
Service was friendly and attentive.
The dining area is decorated like a household- very comfortable and clean.

Service was horrible.
Need to teach servers how to turn tables, prebus, etc.

Yoli's Cafe was such a delight - and cute as a button.
We walked in and were greeted by a very polite waitress.
Our drinks were brought immediately, and lunch followed shortly thereafter.
What a quaint restaurant tucked off the beaten path in downtown Chandler.
I can't say enough about the quality of the food.
The applesauce was the freshest, the egg salad sandwich the tastiest, and the fries (my wife let me sneak a few of hers) were the most fresh-cut.
Absolutely recommend and plan to be back - I'll never get enough of that egg salad

One of Chandler's best hidden secrets, and I'll just leave it at that to keep the suspense up.
But what I will say is that if you make it, try the Tuna Melt.

I found this place when looking for an early Sunday breakfast.
The cafe is somewhat located on a quiet residential street.
I nearly passed it in fact.
It is attached to several other businesses by a courtyard with limited outside seating.
The food is what you would expect, OK.  Would I go back, sure but it may not be a primary destination.
Give it a try!

I have yet to try something at Yoli's that I did not enjoy.
The chorizo skillet, green eggs & ham omelet, French toast, and cheddar biscuits are just a few highlights.
My bf & I have been going here for Sunday breakfast for over 6 months now, we love it...the courtyard, the food, the staff, the ladies singing in the kitchen!
:) The only reason I hesitated before giving a 5 star review is the more people that try it, the less chance I have of getting my favorite window table on Sunday.

Far from what I expected after reading reviews on here.
The area is cute, and I love the fountain with all the bird cages around, and the food was good, but when I have to wait over 40 minutes when there are maybe 8 tables, something isn't right.
The food was good, and almost worth me going back, but myself, and the table next to us waited at minimum forty minutes for our food after order.
Also, I noticed my on my bill, that I payed $4 for a kids meal when the menu says $3.50.
Menu says $1.50 for a small chocolate milk, but I payed $2 for it.
I could be wrong, but I think I got over charged ( duh ).
So yeah, if you do decide to go, go early, and check your bill thoroughly.

This is such a secret garden type spot -- lovely patio area, which I will try out when it is cooler next month.
We were seated quickly at 9am on a Sunday morning.
Wait staff very attentive and kept me posted on our food's progress.
Everything was very "fresh and clean" -- blueberries (TONS) in the pancakes were juicy and fresh, lots of fresh veggies in the omelette, (I'm sure) homemade cinnamon-raisen toast to die for...  ONLY downside was the really long wait for the food.
I had my three young kids with me and luckily I had lots to keep them busy because it was a long wait.
But we will be back, with our toys in tow...

Gotta love Yoli's.
Friendly atmosphere and located in a cute courtyard.
Since the first time I went, I felt like a regular and I really like that.
If you're impatient and looking for the fastest service, this isn't the place for you, but if you're looking for a warm, pleasant, relaxing place with EXCELLENT french toast.
This is definitely the place.

I'm giving Yoli's 5 stars for the winning combination of great food for a great price at a quaint location.
Went there on a Saturday late in the morning and we were seated right away.
Great little hideaway in downtown Chandler.
I ordered the Morning Monte.
It was delicious.
My family ordered various other items and we all sampled a bit off each others' plates and everything was excellent.
My favorite item was the chorizo burro.
Excellent chorizo with the correct combination of meats and spices.
The waitress was friendly and we chatted with the owner and she was very nice also.
Another really great thing about this place is the prices.
I don't think there are any items above $8 and most meals here are in the $6-$7 range.
Very reasonable for the good quality food you get.
After breakfast we took a walk around the courtyard and had a nice time looking around at the plants and exotic birds they have on site.
We also got a chance to meet the owner of the property and she was super nice also.
I will definitely be back to try out some other menu items.

We liked and will be back again, but we could've done without staff wearing open-toe shoes in/around the kitchen.
Food was good, portions were good, staff was friendly, just need to work on being TOO casual with the attire.

My first time here, and I loved it.
My family came with me, including my husband, 2 young sons and my mother in law.
The kids played with the puzzle and coloring books making it nice for the adults to talk.
The best part of our experience was being about to go outside and enjoy the garden area.
Overgrown trees shade the cobblestone walk.
They have cages outside filled with birds for everyone to enjoy.
It was a great way to spend sunday morning.
The food was huge portions, and I will be back next weekend for sure.

Today (10/13/12) was my very first experience of Yoli's.
I would like to start by making it clear that the food was delicious, the servers were fantastic and the atmosphere was quaint and comfortable.
I was geared up to provide a 4 or 5 star rating.
The only disappointment of the experience was the wait for my breakfast.
I waited an hour from the time I ordered to the time I finally got my meal.
I appreciated our server - she was so nice.
She apologized and checked on us regularly.
Unfortunately, that time period is just unacceptable to me, especially for breakfast.
I'll try Yoli's again for all of the other "pros".
Hopefully, I won't have the same experience.

I read about Yolis in the paper and decided to go there.
Seems like a lot of other people did as well as when we go there it was a 45 minute wait for food.
They told us that in advance and we decided to stay.
They were out of several items as they had sold out (French Toast - really, can you just run to the supermarket and buy more supplies?
This is a breakfast staple).
While the serves were really nice and friendly they were not the best at their job.
They would forget to bring things and when you asked they say they will bring it out and never did.
The table next to us had to ask 3 different servers for their toast before it got bought out.
It was a nice day so we wanted to sit outside.
That was a mistake.
There were flies everywhere.
What grossed me out was when we left there were 4 flies on the top of the syrup bottle on our table.
That means whoever used the Syrup next would be using Syrup that flies had been on (and the same goes for us, how many flies were on the Syrup bottle before we used it).
The food was big and good.
You can't argue about value for money.
That being said as much as I don't like chain breakfast places, I would prefer to go to one, not have to wait, not have flies and get better service.
Would I go here again, not worth the 15 minute drive so my answer is no.
If I lived closer I might go again but would only eat inside and bring my own Syrup!

Yoli's Cafe has THE BEST service hands down.
They were very accommodating of our large group and our requests.
Our waitresses were patient and friendly.
The monte cristo breakfast sandwich was AMAZING!!!
but what really blew me away were that they served the best pancakes in the world!
The food was so good that our group came back the next day for lunch.
The pulled pork was delicious!
All the food tasted fresh and made with love.
I wish I lived in Chandler so that I can have this place every week.
If I am ever in Arizona again, I will be sure to make a trip out to Yoli's

Other than waiting 40 minutes for breakfast we liked it.
Nice menu with good food.
Server was friendly and attentive.
I had the monte which was good other than the lack of crispy bacon.
My own preference.
Kids loved the French toast.

I would like to give this place a negative review just to keep other people away from it.
It's a hidden gem in Downtown Chandler area.
Went there for breakfast on Sunday and the food was awesome!
The service was outstanding as well.
Definitely sit on the patio.

The old saying, "don't judge a book by its cover" more than applies to Yoli's Cafe.
We actually considered passing it up because the surroundings are less than appealing.
We went around a side street taking us to the entrance rather than the back by the spray painted buildings with bars on the windows.
It's actually very cute and inviting when you go around front.
There was a woman with a parrot on her shoulder talking to people sitting around in the shade.
I was intrigued but much too hungry to stop.
Anywho, it's a very small little spot and we sat out on the cute little patio.
Our server was very friendly and helpful !
Both my boyfriend and I got different skillets which I forgot the names of (sorry).
But they were both delicious !
I would definitely recommend this little spot to others if you're looking for a yummy breakfast/brunch !

The food was good but took over 40 mins to arrive to our table; the food didn't justify the wait.
There were a lot of people there which says other good things about the quality of the food, but this probably didn't help how long our food took.
It looked like there was a single cook working a small griddle.

This place is seriously awesome.
My boyfriend and i have been staying down the street for a wedding so we tried the food for the first time on friday.
The prices are super fair and the quantities are huge!
We haven't had time to dine in and enjoy but we got take out and ate on our hotel room balcony.
We have eaten at Yoli's three days in a row now!!!
Breakfast and lunch!
There was nothing we didn't love.
If your in this area you gotta try it.
WARNING...place is addicting so you won't just order one time, we didn't even consider giving another place a try

Yoli's is easily in my top favorite breakfast restaurants.
I usually go with my gf Saturday or Sunday mornings and get the mix and match.
You can pick from several items and I usually get the standard egg, sausage, has browns with one pancake.
And, this pancake is just about perfect.
It's big, fluffy and cooked to a light and slightly crispy golden brown.
You don't even have to use syrup.
Recently, I tried the Morning Monte which I am definitely getting next time.
The flavor is exquisite.
Just about everything on the menu is worth ordering.
The restaurant is tucked away in a garden oasis in downtown Chandler.
We wouldn't have found it except for all the popular Yelp reviews.
They have a good amount of outdoor seating nearby a quaint arrangement of flowers, plants and birdcages that house several exotic and colorful birds.
It's worth going just to check out those lil guys.
The only downside is that the kitchen is small, so when the brunch rush hits, it can take a while.
But Yoli and her staff are so friendly and pretty honest about the wait.
We grab coffee and sit it out.
Trust me, it's worth it!

Good place - awesome coffee - wonderful outside area just beautiful.
Food was pretty good too.
Would recommend!

One of the best breakfast meals I have ever had.
If you are in the area, hit this one up.
I will go back every time.
Rock on!

Excellent place to eat.
Their food is always hot and fresh and the bagels are always soft and melt in your mouth.

I was apprehensive when it came to eating at a little hole in the wall joint located in the middle of what seemed like a residential area.
My buddy and I drove past it 2-3 times without even realizing it.
Food: I ordered the Turkey Pastrami and was pleasantly surprised.
The sandwich tasted very good and the meat wasn't overly salty.
The Swiss was a nice touch.
I'm not a fan of rye bread but it went very well with the rest of the accoutrement.
I didn't have anything else while I was there except for coffee (which was pretty good - got me all wired).
I'd like to dine here again when I'm in town.

So, when you find it.. and you see it's a house you might think.. okay, let's go to wildflower instead.
however, trust your instinct and stay.
Inside is small, and simple.
The ladies working there are all upbeat, funny, sweet, and listening to the hits RnB singing while they work.
My boyfriend and I loved it!
The food!
the food is delicious.
The mornin' monte is so good and the homemade marmalade is great.
French toast, yummy!
hawaiian sweet bread french toast?
Sign me up.
the whole experience was amazing from this little homemade hole in the wall place that our waitress said the food is made with 'love and happiness.
' and that's exactly what we got.
A+!

I love the food (aside from the green eggs and ham omelette.
) My only issue is the noise.
The size of the place is part of the issue, but generally the employees are loud and the place just seems to encourage a very "barking" atmosphere.
Very tasty, but I'd like to see them work on creating an ambience to match the food.

I really wanted to like this place.
It has really great reviews and I love supporting local small businesses.
However... my boyfriend and I didn't have the best experience.
When we first walked in, it was the cutest little cafe surrounded by a courtyard with wild birds chirping.
It was so beautiful!
So, we decided to sit outside.
We went inside to get sat and the host asked us, two for lunch?
It was 11:15 am on Saturday and we wanted breakfast.
We tried to explain and the host went on to tell us that if we wanted breakfast she would have to talk to the cook, because she might've put everything away.
But she might be able to make pancakes?
None of this made any sense but we ended up taking a lunch menu and a breakfast menu.
When she came out to take our order, she continued to ramble on about how they don't think they could do breakfast.
We give up and we ordered lunch.
we sit for about ten minutes and another table near us gets sat.
I overhear them ordering breakfast which kind of irritated me.
I let it go and still hold high hopes for this monte cristo I've heard such amazing things about.
What feels like a while later, we finally get our food.
It's nothing special.
It's really just okay.
My boyfriend had ordered and pastrami on rye and it was dry and overcooked and they didn't even put the sauce on it (that's why he ordered it), so we had to ask for it.
Overall, we wouldn't go back.
Maybe for breakfast... lol.

My boyfriend and I love coming here!
Great food and people.
I try to come every weekend.
I recommend this place to anyone and everyone!

We were headed to Chandler's mall and thus, decided to try a place for breakfast that we'd never heard of, since we're in the area about 3 times a year.
A Yelp search brought up Yoli's Cafe with it's 4 start average out of 101 reviews.
Looked unique, kitschy and in the general area of where we were going.
Done!
There was a short wait and a bit of miscommunication when we were sat and waited semi-long for coffee.
However, I have a soft spot for people in the service industry working breakfast.
It's such a bumbling rush for a few short hours and lots of people are angry jerks who pound gallons of coffee.
(How is it possible for some people to CHUG boiling hot coffee?
)   Once that was all rectified we ordered our breakfast and seriously waited about 4 minutes before it arrived.
AWESOME.
I got a breakfast sandwich on an Everything bagel (warm, chewy and toasty.
Delicious.
) with egg whites, mushrooms, spinach and subbed cheddar/jack for the Havarti.
It was one of the most perfect breakfast sammies I've ever had--and I'm a connoisseur.
Boyfriend ordered the veggie omelet which was STUFFED!
with veggies and came with really tasty hash browns and some toast.
They brought out sides of homemade hot sauce and verde sauce on his requst.
The verde was cilantro magic.
I wish I could buy a gallon.
To-go coffee was offered by our sweet server and all said, breakfast was $18.
Come on!
Oh how I wish Yoli's was closer to home.

I've only been here for lunch.
Delicious food.
Awesome customer service.
Breakfast looks pretty good - looking forward to trying it!

Average food, small place-- bad a very long wait after you order your food.
Make sure you have plenty of time if you plan on coming here!

Great food great service and very quaint.
Nice outdoor seating.

This is a small out of they way place with very good food and super friendly service, There homemade biscuit is excellent either with gravy or as a breakfast sandwich.
Get there early and the parrots will talk to you.
So much fun.

Never waist you time going there the service is rude the woman on the front doesn't know how to talk to people she's very stupid she need to learn how to keep her conments to her self better places around town with better services and better food and prices

Sometimes seating is a bit scarce, but once you have a table, the service is friendly and the food is good.

french toast done RIGHT!
Best I ever had.
Loses a star though for appearance, not the nicest inside.
Priced well and amazing service.
Again, try the French toast.

Very tiny and kinda unkempt place in a  working class neighborhood.
Lots of poor birds cooped up in miserable cages on the patio.
We arrived at 11 am ish and spent over an hour waiting for our breakfast in the sweltering heat.
Servers nice enough, food fine but really an hour?
WTHeck?
So... not worth the wait, over rated big time.
SKIP IT!

I had the steak and eggs, they  were good.
This is a whole in the wall place but the people there make you feel welcome.
With my grading of food it's either good or not.
I would recommend this place to anyone.

best breakfast i ever had.
they had a lot of different things for breakfast instead of same old stuff.
i highly recommend if you are in the area.
jeanne fors

Love it.
Really good food and nice people.
Check out the courtyard.

Top tip for Chandler: stay at the historic San Marcos Resort Hotel and stroll through the charmingly renovated downtown square to Yoli's for a super friendly family breakfast.
We enjoyed the great (and quick) service and the charming mister-cooled funky courtyard complete with parrots.
Don't forget to ask for the home made chile marmalade.

Great food, huge portions, great service, great ambiance!
Awesome find!

Yoli's Café is a very cute little breakfast nook in downtown Chandler.
From the outside, it certainly looks sketchy.
But the back patio is extremely cute and our food and service was great!
Awesome pancakes and Hawaiian French Toast, and the steak and peppers skillet breakfast was absolutely delicious.
For a quick, casual and cheap breakfast in Chandler, this is a great spot.

Everything we have tried we have enjoyed.
The Morning Monte is delicious, the marmalade really adds the extra zip.
Hubby loves the cheddar biscuits with gravy.
Service is always great, and we love that it is a local owned family restaurant.
They treat our three year old like a princess, and she loves the birds in the courtyard.

French toast without a smothering of syrup!
Great ambience for a lazy summer morning, we loved the touch of heat in the marmalade that came with the french toast, the cheddar biscuit sandwich was also tasty (a little salty for my taste, but I didn't order this one).
Wait staff was helpful, prompt, personable.
And because it *was* a lazy summer morning, Yoli came out and chatted as we lingered over our coffee and the younger one in our party checked out the parrots in the courtyard.
Looking forward to gradually making my way through the menu.

Fantastic hole in the wall.
The chef even came out to ensure we were enjoying our food.
Great service, great food, would definitely come back!

I'm doing it!
4th time here & every meal-awesome!
I've tried the Monty, French toast, chorizo skillet & asada breakfast burro.
Delish!!!!!
Owners awesome & staff is fantastic.
Way to go!!

Quaint set up.
ALMOST reminds me of HOT (my personal fave).
Menu items look good and there's a good variety.
Newspaper on hand to read which I really like.
Courtyard/patio dining, with misters, option.
Very limited seating indoors.
I had the pulled pork and it was fantastic.
I will be back.

Excellent waitstaff, delicious food, and good prices!
And there are rescue birds (mostly tropical) in the courtyard.
A little loud inside, but definitely a place I will visit again!

I really have mixed feelings about this place; food vs. service.
We decided to try Yoli's for breakfast yesterday.
When we arrived we walked through the courtyard and there wasn't an obvious sign that's shows you how to get seated or if you seat yourself.
Several servers just kept walking by even though I'm pretty sure we both had confused looks on our faces.
Once we got inside we were not really greeted.
The woman running the counter just kept glancing at us while we stood there and servers kept rushing around us.
It made us feel uncomfortable and in the way.
Finally we were told someone would be with us shortly.
While we waited something hard smashed onto the floor causing me to jump, one server loudly was yelling that It wasn't her fault, while the lady behind the counter was arguing, in a sarcastic tone, that it was.
The woman behind the counter loudly exclaimed that three coffees were ready, the server argued she only needed one.
They decided to yell back and forth about who was wrong.
There was absolutely zero professionalism.
Seriously, and if that was the owner acting in that manner then you can never expect the rest of the staff to behave either.
We had only been there a few minutes and our experience was already stressing me out.
I'll never understand people that truly have no tact or show courtesy, especially In front of the business's customers.
Finally we were seated and gave our drink order.
After our drinks were brought we gave our food order; we went for the hearty skillet, and the Hawaiian french toast.
The wait time on our food was actually pretty quick, maybe 10 minutes.
When the food arrived everything looked great, we dug in.
We're trying this new thing where we pick a couple items from a menu and share, so we both got to try everything.
We both felt the skillet was very tasty and was seasoned well.
We also agreed on the Hawaiian french toast that while it was good, there was nothing special about it.
It tasted no different than decently made french toast made with a thick texas toast bread.
We were expecting pineapple to come with it but that's extra.
They really should automatically add pineapple if they're going to call it Hawaiian.
That's like calling regular french toast "Texas French Toast" when using the regular texas toast.
Our main issue with Yoli's, as others have stated, is the lack of professionalism with the staff.
We heard our own server walk past our table several times cursing and exasperating her breath dramatically.
It was a turn off because we felt like we were a nuisance to the staff, as well as some staff members liking to show customers how exhausted they are.
Also we sat near a cart where the servers were throwing all the dirty dishes, and a pile of trash started accumulating on the floor that no one bothered to pick up; straw sleeves, empty and dripping creamer cups, napkins, foil, etc... No one cared that the guests could see how messy they were.
Overall while the food was good, the service was terrible.
Would we go back?
Possibly, when it cools off so we can sit outside away from the craziness that goes on inside.

Best little place ever...
Loved the food!!
Staff really nice and friendly...  We had the Monty and the Chorizo Omelette!
Definitely making this our Sunday after church spot :)

Great service, great food for the price.
Make sure to check out the aviary in the courtyard.

I went here with 3 other family members for my birthday.
We arrived at a peak time, on a Sunday around 10 am so I expected a wait.
We waited over an hour to be seated but then had to wait another hour for our food so we were finally eating (lunch at this point) over two hours after we arrived.
The outdoor ambiance was wonderful.
There was foliage and a beautiful outdoor eating area on a wooden platform, which we didn't get to enjoy during breakfast because we learned that area isn't actually owned my Yoli's.
So instead we were seated inside and if the air conditioning was on I couldn't tell.
We were so hot we were sweating.
And we weren't even brought water until we had been sitting there sweating for 45 minutes.
The food was the biggest disappointment.
Everyone ordered something different so we could get a good overall impression.
We ordered the "Hawaiian" French toast, supposedly a house specialty.
It tasted like regular French toast, and not even great French toast at that.
Supposedly it has pineapple but none of us could taste anything.
The sausage gravy that came with the biscuits was disgusting.
It had the consistency and taste of frozen generic gravy so I highly doubt it was homemade, as the restaurant claims.
The sausage links also appeared to be reheated from a frozen package.
My egg and bacon biscuit sandwich came with one strip of thin, cheap bacon that only covered half my sandwich.
The cheddar biscuits were nothing special and there was no option of a plain biscuit.
Unfortunately the whole menu was also pretty limited.
By the time we ate at noon they apparently had run out of a lot of things.
Overall the food quality was poor, the wait was ridiculous, even for peak hours (they could have at least brought us water), and the restaurant was too cramped and uncomfortable.
I do not recommend this place, especially if you have children because the wait is too long and the menu is too specialized for picky eaters.

So here I am sans family and not a clue where to go and what to eat, so like the rest of us: HELP YELP!!??
Found this hidden gem in Chandler and definitely would recommend it!
The staff is friendly, helpful, and ready to work!

Morning Monte was really good!!
Driving up seeing the outside we weren't to sure if we wanted to stop but once inside it looked fine and the food was so good.
Good prices and good coffee we will be coming back.

Only recently found this through Yelp - didn't even know it existed as it is tucked away of the well-beaten path.
Rating based on two visits - one great, one not-so-great.
But will give it another try and re-evaluate.
The owners are VERY friendly and I like that it's a family owned business, not a chain.
Even if they don't live in Chandler :)  Our first visit left a great impression - food was great, pancakes, French toast, biscuits and gravy - great.
Even their homemade salsa is great.
Only thing I noticed is its a bit LOUD inside - noise caused by the staff, need to tone it down a bit in my opinion.
But great meal, friendly people, reasonable prices - will definitely return!
Second trip, however was horrible.
Quickly seated and order placed.
But we noticed it was taking an inordinate amount of time for our orders to come up.
And our waitress (same one as first trip) was very inattentive.
We had to call her over a few times and ask what was taking so long.
It took 40 minutes for our food to come up - our waitress told us it was a new cook.
The scrambled eggs were basically inedible - way overcooked.
Talked to the owner and she would have made it right but I didn't feel like waiting any longer, so paid the bill and assured her we'll be back to try it again.
Only other negative was again LOUD - this time caused by a table with some unruly people in the corner.
I think the place is a bit of an echo chamber.
I noticed two groups moved to tables further in the restaurant to get away from them.
A bit annoying as they also had to wait for their meals and were still there when we left.
May try sitting outside next time but it's a bit hot right now.

I visited Yoli's two weeks ago for a breakfast business meeting.
It was a great experience.
The staff were personable and polite.
Our waitress told us about the area and was very patient when our guest was late.
Bringing coffee regularly, but not interrupting.
The food was excellent.
It was so nice to find a non-chain restaurant in the Chandler area with great food at a price I can afford to go to when work isn't buying.
:-)  I highly recommend them.

Beyond Excellent and attentive service.
The food was very delicious.
I had the monte cristo and found that it was perfect and tasted great.
The outside patio is great too

This place rocks!!
The staff was quick to greet us, take our drink and food order and offer refills.
First time we were told they were short staffed and would be a wait.
To help pass the time, the waitress came by often to chat, refill coffee, and bring us a free homemade muffin.
She was very funny and kept us entertained.
Second time, Yoli came by to see how we were doing and chatted for a few minutes.
I highly recommend the veggie skillet with chorizo added.
Also love the Monte and the hearty skillet which should be renamed "the kitchen sink of breakfast" because it was everything you dreamed of and more.
They even offer flavored coffee creamer, bonus.
Good job guys!!

Not sure what all the hype is about this place.
Service is horrible... Showed up at 10:30AM on a Sunday and checked in at the awkward counter and was told by the hippie hostess the wait was about 20 minutes.
So the wife and I graciously agreed to wait and take a stroll through the atriums and check out the bird rescue( probably the coolest part of this whole place).
As we ended out our about 15 minute stroll to see the birds, the hippie hostess comes and notifies several waiting parties that she has just been notified by the cook that the wait is about an hour now.
How you go from 20 minutes to over an hour is beyond me.
When you figure out how to run a restaurant let the world know and we might be back... Until then, good luck!

Yoli's Cafe is a little gem hidden off a side street in Chandler.
We had passed once before from trying it out, from the outside it looks like not much at all - it's in a historic house, off a side street.
Once you go into the courtyard however, it's a lovely place to enjoy breakfast.
The inside has a handful of tables.
The wait staff was probably the most friendly bunch of people I have ever been served by.
There was singing going on in the kitchen and just an atomosphere of happiness and family.
The food - yum.
I had the morning monte.
I don't do eggs, so this french toast sammy with turkey, bacon and havarti was a delish option.
It's served with a homemade orange jam - OMG.
I wanted to lick the jam cup -  I'm pretty sure I could eat this jam on anything!
Hubby had one of the skillets, hashbrowns, eggs, meats, gravy and biscuits served up in cast iron.
All the components were good - and the fresh made biscuits - YUM.
Maybe next time I have bisuits and jam.
Perfect Iced tea also - and that doesn't happen everywhere!
Plus - very reasonably priced  - 2 breakfasts, 2 drinks and a togo container of jam for around $25.
You can tell they have pride in their work and it shows in their cooking, service and attitude.
Makes you feel great about supporing a local business!
We'll be back!

Great little unassuming place in what looks like a courtyard of a home.
Food was excellent, service very friendly

This place has better than typical breakfast food with the coolest people working here.
Far better than average food, GREAT service, nice little patio = I'll be back soon!

Great food, good service.
I had an egg white Carne asade burrito and my husband had the 2 eggs any style with French toast, ham and toast!
He got to choose his sides which made him very happy.
:-)

Moved to the area in May.
In my hunt for food came across Yoli's cafe and loved the vibe and location.
I have eaten here now 4 times and have had 3 good visits and 1 not so great.
Food and staff are always consistently good.
French toast, carne burro are favs.
The one visit that was shaky was because they were too busy.Long wait times, not enough seats, etc...
There success might be their curse.
So be patient and if it looks too busy it is.

Good biscuit but I like the chorizo burrito my boyfriend ordered better.
It had more flavor and "kick to it".
Staff was friendly and I enjoyed sitting out in the patio.
Nice place to have brunch.

Great atmosphere, food and staff!!!
The restaurant is at what used to be an old home and has a lovely outdoor seating area with cafe lights and landscape.
Perfect place to cozy up with a cup of joe and great food.
There are also some rescue birds that you can walk around and see after your meal.
Highly recommend!!

All the other reviews are correct.
Not only is the  food delicious, but the unique open atmosphere makes it a true gem.
The outside appearance prevented me from venturing here in the past & I really wish it hadn't.
Came with my friend who's  a regular  and can't  wait to come back!

Seriously you do not need to wait 1 hour after being seated to have breakfast delivered.
While this place is very charming, it is understaffed and the wait is outrageous for service and food.
After arriving at almost noon on a Saturday 11/9/13, we waiting 20 mins for a table, which in itself is more than reasonable for a table.
The service took a while to greet us and eventually we were given menus and ordered breakfast.
Now we waited another 20 mins after ordering and the server who was friendly asked if we needed anything.
Yes, food!
She went to check on our order and came back and said it would be another 40, yes FORTY MINS for our simple breakfast order to arrive.
Shame on you for making customers wait over an hour to eat.
This was not shared before sitting down!
I overheard other customers also discussing long waits.
Do not go to this restaurant if you're looking for a quick or even timely meal and do not expect much from the service either.

I wanted to love Yoli's Cafe, but our experience was less than stellar yesterday.
When I arrived, I was told the wait would be 20 minutes.
I wound up waiting an hour.
I've never waited that long in any restaurant in Phx before.
When we finally sat down, we weren't given menus, we had to track someone down to get some.
It took a long time for our order to be taken and to actually deliver the food to the table.
My friend was getting irritable and I think that's the only reason our food came faster!lol The patrons next to us got so fed up that they left.
The French toast was not good and the short stack pancakes were just ok.
They were a little "doughy" for me, but my friend loved them.
Since her French toast sucked, she had to eat my pancakes to get full.
Now the pièce de résistance was the cheddar biscuit breakfast sandwich.
OMG!
So good!
Get it please!
Mine had egg whites, spinach, mushroom and Havarti cheese.
It was one of the bagel sandwiches, that I subbed the biscuit instead.
On the positive side, our waitress was very nice and apologized several times and even provided us with a muffin to hold us over.
I understand that they were swamped possibly due to the festival going on that day, but everything really reflected poorly on their establishment.
The prices for breakfast are very affordable, so I guess that's why people flock here.
I'm definitely willing to give it another shot, especially for that biscuit sandwich.
Plus I really want to support local family owned businesses.

Some of these 1 and 2 star reviewers need to go eat at Denny's more often if all they want is a cattle trough feeding experience.
You had to wait for a table?
Well no kidding.
When the place has 9 or 10 tables, there might indeed be a wait.
Some of us like a leisurely weekend breakfast or brunch at a small, family owned cafe and we don't mind the wait.
The facts are that Yoli's has very good food that is delivered with a smile by a staff that feels more like family than strangers if you bother to step into the place more than once.
Prices are very reasonable for everything on the menu.
The cheddar biscuits are amazingly good.
Breakfast skillets, omelettes, pancakes, etc.
are all delicious and the portions are very generous.
The wait for food has never seemed excessive to me after eating here at least 15 times.
Wait times seem appropriate given a small kitchen and small kitchen staff and everything on the menu being made to order.

I found this little gem of a place thanks to Yelp!
What a find!
It definitely doesn't look like much from the outside but WOW the food was aaaahhhhmazing!
It is very small but if there is a line - it is worth the wait.
I had the Mornin' Monte and I highly recommend it.
My friend had French toast and said it was delish.
We both had the country potatoes which were good too.
I look forward to trying other items the next time I am in Chandler!

I've came across this place on Yelp before and always wanted to give it a try...But I got lost somehow and couldn't find the location and just gave up lol.
Well I  finally found Yoli's on Google maps one day and I guess I know why I missed it the first time because it's in a run down area of Chandler and the restaurant is actually an old house.
I ordered the garden skillet with raisin bread toast and their famous Morning Monte Sandwich.
Presentation wise, the food didn't look really presentable.
There's a hype on Yelp of their Morning Monte and it's basically french toast with eggs and bacon (BTW the bacon looked like it's been left out all day, definitely not fresh).
The garden skillet was OK but I had better breakfast skillet elsewhere.
I just felt like something was missing.
The service?
Um...OK as well.
Our food took forever and I was just sipping on my coffee...next thing I know I was sitting there with an empty coffee cup for about 10 minutes or so.
I had really high expectations for this place because of the yelp reviews, but I was a bit disappointed and I honestly thought the food was comparable to IHop or Dennys IMO...

Never will I return to this place, I have not tried their food but the customer service alone was enough to make me never want to come back.So me and my friend show up albeit on a saturday morning we go inside because there's no clear signs as to where we should sit we ask one of the servers if we can just sit anywhere she says and I quote "yes go ahead and sit anywhere there's no wait list" so we go sit at a table after sitting there for a good 5 minutes another server comes and tells us that's not assigned to yolis mind you its still in the courtyard so we ask him where we should sit he looks pretty confused at this point and starts clearing up a table for us, well then a lady comes which I assume is the owner and very rudely says you guys can't sit here those people over there have been waiting for over an hour for this table we have a waiting list inside.
I told her I had asked a server inside and she told me there was no list her response exactly was and at this point she had raised her voice "well I'm telling you you cannot sit here and there is a waiting list" by this time we had had it we left and if it wasn't for a parade that was going on in the downtown area we would have gone to in pockets which we love and always get treated with respect.
Very unpleasant people and very disorganized place..

I had the Morning Monte which was delicious.
I never would of found out about this place without Yelp.
It's in a residential area off the main road.
Don't let that fool you though, the food was good and staff was friendly.
The outside area was nice and they even had a macaw!

Hidden gem alert!
It doesn't look like much from the outside and it's not in the main hub of downtown Chandler.
But as soon as you walk in you feel like you are in a completely different place!
The cafe used to be a small house.
Not much room inside, but there are plenty of tables on the patio and in the lovely gardens.
It is the perfect time of year to sit outside and take in the beauty and serenity of the gardens.
Also, there is an exotic bird sanctuary at the far end of the garden.
My kids got the biggest kick out of the macaws saying "hello" and dancing.
Luna was our favorite!
We also sat and played a few games of checkers.
Our food seemed to take awhile but other than that, the service was great!
Very attentive.
Our server even told about the cafe, how long they have been there, how they brought the bird sanctuary in, very interesting!
She also told us about the brewery that will be opening next store which we are really excited about!
And speaking of food, it was delicious!
I got the Hawaiian French toast and my hubby for a breakfast burrito with fresh salsa, so good!
A few things that would make this 5 stars in my book...they need to carry non-dairy milk options.
They didn't have almond or even soy.
And I would have loved a cappuccino or some espresso drink.
It just seems fitting with the gardens to have espresso.
That would be lovely.
Overall, great spot.
Family friendly, great service.
Will be back!

A few things... - This place is located in one of the older, and more colorful, parts of Chandler - When you find the place you'll wonder if its the right place - Parking can be a challenge  Ordered biscuits and gravy.
Not bad...little light on sausage but pretty good overall.
The biscuits were very good, but for some reason seemed to be somewhat toasted...odd.
Good place...will go again.

If you have taste buds and you want to reward them with a little bit of pure joy then you need to do the following:  Put down your phone Put pants on Find car keys Drive to Yolis Park car Order ANYTHING Tell your mouth "you're welcome"

"You can't rush perfection.
"-Said a really, really smart guy somewhere.
As someone who travels relentlessly across the globe, trying both national chains and local gems alike, I must say that Yoli's Cafe is the one place that I love coming back to.
However, I won't write about their "Morning Monte" for two key reasons: 1.
Everyone else has.
Read their reviews.
I've never had it.
(Although next time I go in I'll have to try it!
)  Around two years ago, my dad and I were looking for a new place to eat breakfast.
We'd looked everywhere from Scottsdale to Tempe, Phoenix to Glendale, and while we found a few good places and met some nice people, we still were unable to find that one amazing place.
Our search ended when we took a look into our backyard: Downtown Chandler.
There, we found a cozy little cafe owned by quite possibly the nicest, most talented cooks that this world has ever known.
Once we were seated, the first thing we noticed was the huge amounts of variety that their menu offered.
Their breakfast combo allowed us to mix and match a variety of breakfast favorites like bacon, french toast, eggs, pancakes, and around ten other choices, while their portion sizes were enough to feed even the hungriest of people.
Eventually, we settled on trying a little bit of everything via breakfast combo.
After about a 15-20 minute wait that was filled with extremely fun small-talk with our waitress, we received some of the best food that I have ever had.
I would go so far as to say that I was PRIVILEGED to try these amazing cooks' food.
Most notably, however, were their biscuits and gravy.
The biscuits are far from ordinary, plain, boring bread shaped into round masses of blah.
No, they are flavorful, fluffy, and fantastic, owing in part to the fact that they're cheddar biscuits (and yes, they are better than Red Lobster's).
Finally, they are usually put on the grill (they're cut in half) for a moment to lightly toast and have butter melted on them.
Kudos to Yoli, to whom these biscuits owe their name, for creating these little pieces of heaven.
The gravy was nice, not too much sausage, but not lacking either, and perfectly seasoned.
When the two were paired though, well, let's just say it was like a symphony of deliciousness.
I realize that some people just don't like the old southern classic, but at Yoli's they can still find something phenomenal to savor.
Their french toast is to die for, while their veggie burrito is my vegetarian grandma's favorite.
A word of advice, though, do NOT order the pancakes if you aren't ready to a) stop eating McDonald's breakfast forever b) eat lots and lots of awesomeness (they're VERY big)  After two years of visiting this haven of culinary delights, I offer three hints of advice to those who wish to try Yoli's: 1) LISTEN TO THE WARNINGS ABOUT PEAK TIMES!
Every breakfast place is bound to be crowded at the so-called "peak-time" of the morning.
Yoli's is no exception.
They may be culinary wizards, but they don't have time machines.
If you want to be stubborn/don't mind waiting, be their guest and wait for a table.
However, do NOT be rude to the staff just because YOU had the inability to realize that more people means a longer wait.
2) Don't be afraid to talk to the staff.
They're extremely nice and will offer honest opinions on the food.
Also, chatting with them helps time fly.
3) They have big food.
Good big food, but still, big food.
I look forward to my next visit to this amazing cafe, and urge anyone who likes to eat good food to try out Yoli's Cafe.

Found this cute little cafe on Yelp and my friends and I loved it!
It was hard to find at first and my friends both parked too far away and ended up wandering a bit to find it.
I parked at a small parking lot down the street, not sure if it belongs to a random apartment building.
We came here Saturday morning at 9am and it wasn't too busy yet; we didn't have to wait for more than 5 minutes before we were seated!
Our waitress was really attentive and helpful.
I ordered the carne asada burrito and my friends ordered the chorizo skillet (comes with 2 tortillas), and green eggs and ham (comes with toast).
It did seem to take awhile for our food to arrive but the time passed quickly nonetheless because we were having a good time.
I really enjoyed my carne asada burrito which is filled with tender meat, hash browns, and eggs, with a side of salsa.
The salsa was a little bland so I used my favorite condiment ever: ketchup!
My friend enjoyed her green eggs and ham which came out piping hot as well.
I tried my friend's chorizo and eggs and liked it but agreed with him that it could have used a bit more spicy flavor.
You do need to bring your check to the front counter to pay; we waited for a bit before realizing that!
They were super nice about doing separate checks.
And yes the garden has character and we had fun looking at the 2 live parrots behind glass windows in a bird sanctuary.
It did start getting busier when we left around 10:30am.
All in all, a lovely place for breakfast/brunch!

If you want really good breakfast or brunch food this is definitely a hidden gem.
You would never tell driving up to the front, but this place does it right.
I believe Yoli does all of the cooking so when it gets busy, be prepared to be patient.
They share an awesome courtyard with another new place called the Perch Brewery and they have a bunch of rescued exotic birds.
Our daughters love to come to this place just to see the birds, but the real reason we keep going back is the food.
The service is good as well, but don't forget you may have to wait for a table and then be patient for your food...it is well worth the wait!

Found this place on Yelp...A beautiful gem in downtown Chandler!
Loved the atmosphere surrounded by chirping exotic birds nestled in a romantic garden.
Was a lil nervous at first because from the outside it looked like someone's house, but once you come into the garden, it's amazing!
The food was very good, the service amazing!
Enjoyed the talking birds.
It was romantic yet great for the family too!

Arrived at 9:30 am on a Sunday morning .
We were surprised at the location but it works as a local non - chain restaurant.
Our wait was about 15 min and our drink orders were taken promptly.
Wit in 5 min our orders were taken and delivered in another 20 min.
The food was hot and tasty.
All three in our party were satisfied and stated they would come back.
A nice local restaurant.

Man, I love this place!
The food is awesome and the service is top notch!
I usually get the Mornin' Monte, but on Saturday I tried the chorizo burrito and my husband ordered a bagel sandwich which were both so very tasty.
We love coming here because the food is so damn good, the ambiance can't be beat and everyone is so friendly.
They even remember us and that makes me feel so special :)

Make sure to visit Luna, a beautiful cockatoo that sings and dances!

My boyfriend and I came here a couple of months ago and I was slightly disappointed.
They mixed up our orders with another table which happens I understand.
The food was pretty good, but it wasn't incredibly memorable.
I think we should give it another shot sometime though and try a few different things.
The bird cages next to the restaurant were pretty cool.

So many good options for breakfast.
Service is great, the staff is extremely accommodating.
Food took a little long to arrive, but the free and delicious muffin was enough to hold us over

Excellent food and great ambience!
If you're in during breakfast, have the morning monte.
If you want something spicy instead, try the chorizo - it's fresh and flavorful, and one of the best I've tried!

This was a very tasty and reasonable priced little restaurant.
The atmosphere is very homey; of course, its in what used to be an old house.
When you pull up, on Oregon St., it is the back of the restaurant.
You'll have to walk on the north side through what used to be a backyard gate.
As soon as you pass through the gate you realize how charming the outdoor patio will be once all the construction is complete for the other shops/restaurants.
We got to the restaurant just a little before 9:00am and we were sat immediately.
The young lady doing the register/host duties sat us and got us our drinks.
Since everyone suggested the Mornin' Monte, we got that; we also got the cheddar biscuits & steak and pepper skillet.
As I said before, all were tasty.
The Mornin' Monte was a little sweet for me, but my wife thought it was just right.
She especially liked the special marmalade that came with it.
The steak and peppers were prepared wonderfully and the chedder biscuits were smothered in gravy.
If they don't use the patio, it is very small (maybe 10 tables).
Because of the seating situation, know that a wait is probably more the norm, for anytime after 10:00am.
Again, it was very good, we plan to come back.

This place is awesome!
It has a great breakfast along with some great waitstaff.
If you want to go to a one of a kind breakfast place rather than some  chain this place is it.
Don't  get fooled when you drive up.
It is worth going to?
Congrats on a great place

Brought my mom (who was in town), son, and boyfriend here.
The food was so amazing that my mom called my dad (in California) to let him know how great it was.
We all enjoy good food and LOVE breakfast, so we are SO happy to have chosen this spot.
It will be our ONLY breakfast place.
Yoli's never disappoints.
I don't know why I ever go anywhere else.

This place is pretty much the bees knees, them biscuits and gravy, with the crispy softness of the biscuits.. just tastebud heaaaveeen.

I cannot say enough good things about Yoli's.
Let's start with the location; Off the main downtown square a bit, it's hidden in a lovely secret garden where it shares a courtyard with The Perch.
Parking was plentiful and easy.
The interior of the cafe is cute and very much like my granma's old house in Chandler.
It's bright, friendly, and inviting.
The hostess and servers were kind and attentive.
They made suggestions on the menu and gave us to-go drinks as we left.
Now to the best part; the food, oh my!
The Monte Cristo lunch sandwich was heaven on a plate.
The sweet flavors of the toast mingled with the saltiness of the meat and spiciness of the homemade marmalade was inspiring.
The jalepeno coleslaw was a nice addition to the sandwich.
The burger was also delish.
The bun was buttered and slightly toasted, the burger was cooked to perfection, and the fries were thick cut and tasty.
You will not walk away hungry, the portions are very generous!
I will be returning to Yoli's Cafe very soon!

First let me say that this place is hidden yet, very popular amongst the locals; there was plenty of street parking upon arrival but, close to nothing once we left.
The venue is reminiscent of a small house that one's grandmother or great-grandmother may have owned.
We arrived around 10:20 am and was advised of a 20-30 min wait; more like 45 to an hr.
For that I give them 4 stars as they are a but unorganized.
A new restaurant (The Perch) opened a few weeks ago and they share a courtyard with Yoli's which, could be both good and bad.
Yoli's is quite small and it appears that the property lines for both restaurants is very awkward; there are a few tables for The Perch that are right next to and surrounding tables for Yoli's Cafe.
This might be ok PRIOR to The Perch opening at 11 am but, anytime near that, they have no problem kicking you out.
Both restaurants should work together to work this out as it could potentially cause customer service issues.
The food was reasonably priced, I'd return.

Came here for Sunday morning brunch.
The food was very good, but the service was below average and the wait was long.
We shared a cheese biscuit, which was good and I ordered the Breakfast Monte which was also good.
I was going to order a smoothie, but when I asked, the waitress told me that the smoothies were made from a mix, instead of fresh made, so I ordered orange juice instead.
I don't have any complaints about the food.
The wait staff was friendly, but they seem very disorganized.
This place would really benefit from better management and better trained wait staff.
The staff should have assigned stations with specific tables they are responsible for.
When we were seated, it seemed that there was confusion over who was going to be our server.
Once we were seated, there was a long wait for the server to take our drink order, then a long wait for the server to take our food order, then an even longer wait for our food.
We rarely saw our server.
Other people we chatted with afterward, seemed to have the same experience.
Overall, I would say the food is good, but not worth the extremely slow and disorganized service.
If they can improve the service, this would be a four or five star place.

Since "discovering" this place a couple months ago on yelp, my wife and I have been several times by ourselves and with family or friends.
Everyone raved about their meal and the quaint atmosphere, it's not high end or pretencious, but it's clean and bright with good service.
Some of the servers and staff look a little "earth muffiny" with tats and casual clothes, but they're very friendly and attentive.
It reminds me of having breakfast at my grandmother's farmhouse when I was a kid-- very comforting and down to earth, but with healthier choices.
:) The prices are very reasonable and their lunch menu is more diverse than I expected.
The Monte Cristo is my favorite, with Bs&Gs (biscuits and gravy) a close second.
There is indoor and outdoor seating.
I highly recommend this place.

Hours are limited which sucks because I would def go more often.
Outdoor seating area is fun and welcoming.
Food is good and staff are friendly.
A hidden gem!

Great food and friendly staff.
I have enjoyed their amazing french toast and all the burritos are great.
Parking is a little tight at times.
The courtyard area is great to have a sit and enjoy some coffee.

Yolu's Cafe is a gem in downtown Chandler.
Yoli and her staff are so friendly and the relaxed atmosphere makes for a great morning start.
Yoli's menu is fresh and eclectic.
Try her Hawaiian French Toast or Fruit and Yogurt Parfait.
Yoli makes her own granola you have to try.

Best breakfast in town and everyone is so friendly.
Love the atmosphere.
Biscuits and heavy for the table is a must!!
Yummmm

What a fantastic find!
It's off the beaten path and provides great service and amazing food.
The cheddar biscuits are so good!
I will be back for sure!

After a bachelor party, my friends and I needed some sustenance.
It had been a night of heavy drinking and debauchery with the hired entertainment.
This place is a pretty nice hidden gem.
The first time, my friends and I thought it was pretty ghetto because from the rear it looked like you were going into the back of someone's apartment or backyard but it became apparently.
We parked off to the side in case GPS had steered us wrong and we needed to run fast, heh.
The actual cafe is small.
There is seating inside and patio furniture outside and a clear view of The Perch for some after breakfast boozing.
I know we had just drank excessively but sometimes you need to bite the dog that bit cha'.
Y'know?
In any which case, my friends got breakfast options which looked delicious and for all purposes they stated that the breakfast they had was delicious, however, I jumped straight to lunch.
Carne Asada burrito for me.
It came after 10 minutes and was pretty huge.
Sprinkled with cheese and topped with slices of avocado, I dove headlong into the burrito with their delicious green chili salsa.
It wasn't spicy but added good flavor with the jalapenos I had them add into the burrito.
The burrito was pretty good.
Not greasy like FiliB's and was pretty filling.
I would definitely recommend this place.
It's close by and when the time is right, you can easily scooch over to The Perch for some drinks.
We've been coming here for breakfast ever since.

I recently moved to AZ and wanted to try a local spot.
I got on yelp and found this place and it was a pleasant surprise.
Great breakfast and lunch that you can tell everything is homemade.
The pancakes are awesome, the homemade jelly is equally fantastic.
I also recommend the build a burger option for lunch, they have great options like chorizo.
The staff is always very friendly and attentive.
I had the chance to meet yoli herself and she was extremely nice and outgoing!
She even sat down and talked to us and shared her story.
Me and my family are now regulars, even when my parents come in from out of town this is the first place they want to go.

I dined at Yoli's for the first time today at lunch.
When we arrived at 11:40 we were the only customers.
This place only has one waitress so even though our food was okay, the service was super slow.
She was very pleasant, but they need additional cooks and servers.
My friends ordered breakfast, which came almost immediately.
My tuna melt came ONE HOUR after I ordered it.
All of the other outside tables were full and nobody had any food.
My tuna melt was not special in any way, so I would say only come here if you have lots of time and  want to sit and enjoy their cute patio.
I really wanted to like this place, but between the slow service and so-so food, we won't be going back.

The food here was really good.
It's in a super cute hidden spot.
The breakfast combo was perfect and I got to taste a little bit of everything I wanted; the French toast was very yummy.
All the people working there were super helpful and friendly as well.
The part that made this place even more awesome was that they had a bunch of bird cages in the front with a singing cockatoo, love birds, parakeets, parrots, macaws, and more which were so fun to watch and take pictures of.
It was a very fun experience overall.

Seemingly fun location next to The Perch with the birds and what not.
We thought the patio would be nice because it was beautiful out...
The food was good and came out hot.
I just couldn't concentrate on eating because we were getting attacked by flies and dealing with wasp and bee fly-overs the whole time.
I would say they have a problem.
The food took a long time too.
Find something else for breakfast in the area.

This place was fantastic, I stopped by there at random an had the cheddar biscuits and gravy with a scoop of chorizo on top.
The coffee was hot and plentiful, early on a Wednesday morning it was mostly empty.
It looks like most of the seating is outside and it is open just for breakfast and lunch.
I don't think I need to eat again until tomorrow and for only $9 it was a delicious bargain.

Yoli's is a little hidden gem in downtown Chandler.
It's got a little patio with a lot people waiting to be sat.
Everything is made FRESH, so it takes awhile for you to get your food.
Be patient when you come here, it's worth it, but everything takes a while to get to you.
They are on Hawaii time, aka no time.
The staff is super nice and they are very attentive.
They will come around on a regular basis, let you know where you're at with your order and refill your drinks right away and they always as if you want your drinks to go before you leave!
Recommend trying:  French Toast Biscuits and Gravy Skillet  The biscuits and gravy sell out fast so I would recommend getting there early if that's your favorite dish!
PS - before you leave, pick up a cupcake... you won't regret it I promise!

We have been coming here for awhile now and the consistency in great service and great food keeps us coming back.
The biscuits are a must!

Don't let the location fool you!
My girlfriend and I weren't sure it it was a real restaurant or not.
What a diamond in the rough though!
Get a smoothie and try everything you can!

Visited this place about brunch time one Saturday.
It's somewhere in Chandler downtown.
We parked along side Oregon St and walked through this alley like opening from the street.
The outside appearance won't knock you over.
As soon as you walk into the court yard it's a completely different world.
Full of plants and great patio dining.
We opted to sit inside since there were seatings immediately available.
But next time I would definitely vote for patio seating.
The wait staff were friendly and the service was good.
I ordered the Hearty Skillet.
The best part was the flakey and buttery biscuit crumble.
They were heavenly!
I'd say one of the best breakfast I've ever had!
Will definitely be coming back again.
A great place to relax and have breakfast or brunch and lazy away a weekend morning!

You'll wait a while on a Saturday or Sunday morning, but it's worth it!
I suggest The Breakfast Monte sandwich-- with egg whites, bacon, turkey, and cheese pressed between two pieces of french toast!
Amazing!
Service is a bit slow, but it's such a relaxed atmosphere at this place, it really didn't bother us much at all.

I've been here only once for a midweek brunch and the biggest complaint that I have was that the service pretty bad, though the food wasn't.
We arrived at around 10 am and were seated by a young boy, maybe 12 years old.
Roughly 15 minutes later, another 12ish year old boy took our drink order, which took another 10 minutes to arrive.
Finally, about half an hour into our stay, the actual server (who I thought was a customer because she was sitting with a group a few tables away), comes and does that thing some places do where the server sits down at your table and chats while taking your order.
That isn't something I normally mind, it's just a little irritating when you've been waiting for a half hour to order.
Things picked up from there.
I had a carne asada burrito and my husband had a bagel sandwich of some kind.
Both were serviceable if not particularly memorable.
It's actually a very nice patio seating area so if you have to wait at least you have something to look at.
Also, next door is some kind of a bird themed restaurant or bar, so all through our meal we could hear the birds loudly squawking and their keepers attempting to get the birds in their cages.
Some people might not have enjoyed that part but we found it very entertaining.

Hidden Little Gem, do yourself a favor and try this place.
I usually go on the weekends and sometimes they get busy but the staff has always been friendly and the food is some of the best.
Not one person I've recommended try this place has been disappointed.

Their food is comparable to Denny's but sit down setting is nicer : )  I had the steak skillet for breakfast.
Was told they marinate the steak but it tasted pretty plain and I had to use ketchup (which I rarely use).
Personally, it's as good Denny's skillet.
But this place definitely have a nicer sit out garden environment.

Food was great but we did have to wait 45 minutes for our food after ordering.

Patience required!
The service and apparently the kitchen moves at an extremely slow pace.
It took about 20 min to be seated, which was completely fine, but took an hour plus some minutes to get our food!!
Once the food arrived it wasn't bad, but nothing spectacular.
The service was maybe slightly less than okay.

Stopped by at 1pm on Sunday, cool, friendly vibe, but unfortunately they were changing from breakfast to lunch and said it would be 45 min wait for food.
We were too hungry to wait, but since they were so friendly and honest, we'll come back and try again.

Food was good.
I had the cheddar biscuits and gravy and scrambled eggs.
I was skeptical about a cheddar biscuit with gravy, but it was SO GOOD.
I went through the week and it wasn't busy at all, but I hear the weekends are very busy.
My only complaint was a weird urine smell coming from The Perch, which sits next door to Yoli's.
Will definitely return.

I'm not sure who these people are that gave glowing reviews of Yoli's cafe, but this place isn't anything special.. My girlfriend and I decided to try this place based on the yelp reviews, and we didn't like it much.
The service was slow, the hostess station inside was very crowded ( one of the servers bumped me into the coffee station), just a overall disorganized cafe.
We thought that the food would make up for their short comings, but it was just like any other local cafe.
Save your time, and patience by going somewhere else....

Go early!
It gets pretty crowded on the weekends, but we usually go between 7 and 8:00 and never had to wait.
As others have mentioned, the Hawaiian French toast delicious.
I don't eat meat so I usually get the vegetarian breakfast burrito or skillet.
Be sure to ask for the homemade orange marmalade- yum!

Five stars.
All around.
The food, the staff, the prices, the environment.
You won't get this kind of experience or service anywhere else.
I love coming here for breakfast/brunch when I'm in the area.
Overall, one of the BEST hidden gems in the valley.

This place is so quaint and the people working here are sooo friendly!
We brought my mother in law here for Mother's Day breakfast and the ladies were so nice and helpful with her.
She has dementia and doesn't walk well and they helped her walk through the patio and brought her the kids menus which was perfect!
Also brought her a cup with a lid so she wouldn't spill.
Like I said so helpful and kind.
I will be back and back!
Oh, and food is crazy good!

Great service and even better food!
Perfect day to sit on the patio.
The carne Asada burrito was one of the best breakfast burritos we have ever had!
Local spot!!
We love that!

My wife and I are new to the Chandler area and have been trying many of the local restaurants.
This is the best breakfast spot.
Everything we ordered was good & great service as well.
Very reasonable prices.

Am I still in Arizona?
This place is right out of the University District in Seattle.
The garden patio seating is is so peaceful, and not like anything else you are going to find around here.
Come here uptight, eat some fantastic award winning food, get some good vibes, and leave feeling alright out of sight.
I was able to substitute grilled chicken breast for the hamburger patty .
Had some sauteed spinach and avocado with it.
The onion rings were yummy.
I am taking a picture of the back enterance  to the restaurant.
It is hot as blazes out here!
I guess I'm still in Arizona after all.
Do not let  the unglamorous parking throw you off.
Be brave, and walk right in.
I have to get in my car and crank up the AC before my brain melts.
Don't forget to check out the Amazon birds!

1hr wait for our food after we got a seat.
Nice scenery and awesome vibe.
That's were it ends.
The Blueberry muffins was unbeatable and dry.
The biscuits and gravy was pretty dang good.
Should come with sausage or bacon though.
The Carne asada burrito was pretty bland.
The sandwich made out of French toast was the best thing and it was decent at best.
We will be back to the Perch but not here.

Such a fun, small, house-turned-restaurant hidden in downtown Chandler.
Great food.
Good service.
Not too many tables, though, so there is always a wait.
I'll definitely be going back!

Absolutely perfect.
Great food, great service, great atmosphere.
Love everything about yolis!

This little cafe in downtown Chandler is hidden away and doesn't look like much from the outside, but is pretty cute once you get into the courtyard.
It shares a patio area with the Perch and so you can go see the birds while you wait.
There is limited seating, so the wait can seem long for the number of people there.
We sat outside even though it was a little on the warm side in order to speed up the process, but there really is no speeding up the process here.
I shared the garden skillet and biscuits and gravy with my mom and my dad got the chorizo burrito.
The food took a loooong time to come out.
Once it did, it was tasty, but nothing particularly special.
I'm a bit of a brunch snob though and my parents seemed very well pleased with the food.
The prices are good, so if you're looking for a nice outdoor place to go hangout, take your time and not pay too much, this is definitely a good choice.
The staff was very friendly and helpful and the upside to things moving a little slowly is that they never try to hurry you out the door.
We were welcome to sit and chat as long as we wanted.

I went to Yoli's yesterday for the first time and boy what a bad experience, I actually walked out.
We arrived at 11:35 am looking for lunch.
Guess what, they argued about giving us a lunch menu because it wasn't noon yet and then when they finally gave it to us they said they wouldn't take our lunch order until it was actually noon!
What?!?
When I spoke to the hostess she wasn't any help so we left.
I'll not go back to a place that looked like it might be a keeper.
I was shocked to get this kind of reception from a locally owned place...

The reviews don't lie!
We arrived at 10am and there were only 2 other parties.
The service was fast and super friendly.
The Morning Monty is definitely the way to go.
We also had the volcano it was also delicious!
Best food experience we've had on our 2 day visit from San Diego.
Don't let the exterior fool you, this is a diamond in the rough!

Being new to the area I found this place through Yelp.
Going through the reviews we took a chance and went.
Glad we did!
The food was good and the staff was so friendly, you felt right at home.
The wait for the food is a while so only go if you have time to spare.
We will be back to enjoy the food and the staff.

The French toast is a must.
Hearty skillet a good choice, too.
Can't go wrong with anything here.

First time here.
It's right next to The Perch.
I had the steak and peppers skillet.
It was a great change from the normal eggs and bacon type breakfast.
My wife had the French toast w bananas and she loved it as well.
It's a tiny place with great breakfast food.
My only knock is that they don't have dairy creamer for coffee but they do have non dairy options.
Our waitress was fantastic and gave us suggestions on the menu as well as kept our drinks filled and needs accommodated.
