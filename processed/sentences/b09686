Do not let the exterior fool you!
Friendly service that is total quality.
My permanent cleaners.

This dry cleaner is awesome!
Not only are they organic they are family owned and do all the dry cleaning right here.
They are family owned and don't send it out.
They also do nice alterations.
Don't let the front of the place steer you away.
Very good dry cleaner.

We have been using Western Cleaners for years, and have recommended to a lot of people.
Would take my cleaning NO WHERE else.
Friendly, Fast and they CARE.

The building is an old gas station, but don't let that fool you to whats on the inside.
inside are the prettiest girls that are so sweet and so willing to help.
i haven't gotten my dry cleaning back yet, but i'll let you know how it goes.
if it goes as smoothly as the drop off, i'm hooked!!
The girls in there, and the other customers I talked to, were fun to visit with.
They should serve coffee.
Everyone would love to hang out there!

Without other Yelp reviews, I would have passed up this merchant.
The repurposed gas station is not very inviting in outward (or interior) appearance.
Think of them like finding an unpolished diamond.
That being said, the staff was very friendly and accommodated my unexpected need for same day dry cleaning.
That was possible because they operate the cleaning equipment on premises.
It is visible from the front counter.
It was encouraging to see a continuous flow of customers driving much nicer cars than mine.
This appears to be a business that customers seek, not happen by because it is conveniently located.
Great rush job.
Thanks for taking care of my unplanned dry cleaning panic.

Monica and Adam are the best.
Extremely friendly and helpful.
They make it a priority to know you by name and that you're completely satisfied.
I love the gas station look.
It could use a small coat of paint but love the nostalgia look.
They are my cleaners and would recommend them to anyone in the west valley.
They do all my clothes and clean our comforters too.
They do everything in house so you don't have to worry about the other guys being late.
Give them a try!
This is my first yelp post so hope it was not too long and clear to the point.
Again say hi to Adam and Monica.
