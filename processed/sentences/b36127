We have been looking for martial art classes and finally found Master Haydar!
It didn't take long for my kids to enroll & enjoy the teaching of push & kicks.
The M,W, & F schedule works really well for us.
The fact that my kids wants to attend all the classes goes to show he is doing a great job in his teaching.
Oh, his fees are definitely affordable too.

Master Haydar runs a tight ship!
He manages to keep the kids in line while still having fun.
They learn discipline, self-worth and control.
The kids have learned so much and love his class!

My sister in-law signed up my son and nephew for a three week summer course with Master Haydar.
They learned proper stretching, forms, and introductory movements in taekwondo including appropriate conduct.
Master Haydar is approachable and the children felt secure in his presence.
It was a great experience for the children.
