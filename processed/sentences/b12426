I find RetLab to have some neat things, but their price points are just about always rediculous.
Its fun to look at though and both locatons are completely diffrent in terms of stock( which can prove good or bad).

I really like RetLab, but the prices keep me at a distance.
For example, I went in to look and I found the perfect sketchbook.
Adorable and fun, with a little pizzaz, you know?
I was about ready to buy it when I turned it around and looked at the price.
"12.99?
" I asked myself.
"With 8.1 or something % sales tax?
" "No way.
" So I put it down and went to Borders and bought a normal one for 4.27 with tax.

Retail Laboratory huh?
Sounds kinda like a place where Scottsdale shoppers are conceived in a test tube.
I'm a huge fan of this place, but like the other reviewers find the prices a bit prohibitive.
But make no mistake, if you're looking for something cheap -- you WOULDN'T be coming to a Biltmore Fashion Park boutique to find it anyways.
So that criticism is sort of a moot point.
It's about the same size as their old loft space on Roosevelt - which has since closed.
Highlights * Stylish mens/womens boutique but seemingly more friendly than their Scottsdale counterparts.
* Hip labels such as James Perse, J Lindeberg and Modern Amusement mixed with smaller unknown but up-and-coming indie labels.
* Nice selection of pricey chotckies: hipster accessories, novelty books and other assorted cute-but-useless crap.
Worth a visit, if just to browse to see the interesting collection.

The new location is awesome and I love how they place the DJs they have upstairs overlooking the front of the store.
The staff is always friendly and inviting and most of the clothes are great.
I always make time to stop here when I am Biltmore.
