I've utilized Kristena Malgren's CPA services to compile my tax return forms for the past 2 years.
Kristena has been a pleasure to work with, is always willing to research and answer questions and has very affordable rates.
I'd highly recommend her for all your tax preparation and other accountant needs.

Kristena Malmgren was excellent.

Kristena was recommended to us by another CPA.
From my first phone call to her through the completion of our 2013 taxes, I have enjoyed every conversation with her.
The comments and suggestions from her on my "less than usual" tax return were thorough and professional.
I am very satisified on the preparation time and documents prepared.
With this service, Kristena can expect my business for a long time.
