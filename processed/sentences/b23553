A small chain of Las Vegas casinos with nothing BUT gambling  NO thrills & frills just video poker/slot machines  CHEAP EATS,CHEAP Smokes and FREE drinks for gamblers.
Check out the bar menu-CHEAP food & its really good...Chicken Fingers and Fries $3!!
:) Yummy!

No frills place.
I went to the one on St Rose Parkway.
The employee was nice.
Place is like grandmas house.
Why did I go ?
It was a checklist item because I have never been.So whats good and not?
Pro's- Really out for someone who wants to simply play slots If you like to gamble in a quiet area.
If you like to smoke Oldies background music easy parking  Con's  No flat screen TV's Smoke if non smoker No real food strange if your thinking your going to a bar.
No juke box, just golden oldies in background definitely not a meet up spot

Oh Lord, No!
Just no!
Step through the door to a schizophrenic d√©cor of kitchen kitsch and slot machines.
That's IF you can soldier through that fog of second-hand smoke.
They have jars of little candies and snacks you can enjoy with your beer and cigs (?
) while you play away, but why would you??
I understand they have cheap cigarettes, but you don't need to buy any.
Just sit there and breathe.
Or try to.
They also appear to sell food, but since their clientele appears to be 90% meth addicts, who are they selling it to?
Good heavens, if you want to gamble, go to a casino where you can at least get some comps and they attempt to filter the air.
Easy parking can't be the answer- I'm pretty sure none of the regulars own cars.
Go where they have a valet.
Do not go to Dotty's.
