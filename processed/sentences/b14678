I am a devoted patron of the skin & makeup institute.
Although it is a school, I honestly do not feel that quality is compromised.
I have spent high dollars at supposed top-notch spas for similar treatments and have received similiar service and results.
So why pay more?
I regualary get one of three facials: European Spa Facial ($30); the parafin facial which is moisturizing ($45); vitamin c lighetning facial ($50).
All three are very good, but the student can discuss options with you.
Others to try: deep pore clensing facial, deep cleansing back treatment and Aromatherapy Salt Glo.
They also have waxing, bronzing and makeup application, which I have not tried.
No matter what the service is always good and prices cannot be beat!
I will not return to high-end spas when I have the skin & makeup institute just around the corner.
*Tips are also accepted, not mandatory, but I would suggest at least 15%*

I went here this afternoon for underarm waxing.
I had never had it done before, so I was a bit nervous.
The woman at the front desk was very helpful and Laurie who did the waxing was great.
Very calming and friendly.
The place was clean and professional.
It was a good experience, and I will definitely go back!

I have been there at least 3 times and gotten facials each time.
The atmosphere is great and so similar to a spa minus the bathroom/powder rooms they have at spas.
It is $30 for a facial that lasts about an hour.
I am going to start a clinic study series where for $225 they do 8 treatments ranging from facials to peels.
I am very excited and think its a great deal.

This school is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!
the staff is great and they have great students.
I got a microderm facial and it left my skin felt wonderful and soft!
This school is so beautiful and in a great location.
easy to find and I have definitely told all my friends about this place!
