You can't go wrong with Popeye's.
This is the very first time I had Popeye's chicken.
My uncle took me here for a quick lunch when I went to visit.
I was quite excited since there was no Popeye's at the time in my area.
Yay for Popeye's Chicken... although I don't have it anymore because it's a bit well, greasy.

Three stars for the weak service at this Popeyes location.
I've been there a handful of times and found them out of spicy chicken on one occasion, out of red beans & rice on another.
And these weren't busy or overcrowded days.
These are the company's most popular dishes, how can a location be so poorly stocked that they run out of them?
Then there was the visit that they ran out of cooked chicken and locked the door until more was made.
Seriously.
It gave one of the employees some extra time to count biscuits as she made them.
Watching her do this, it was apparent she was having trouble with it.
If you have a choice, find another Popeyes location.
I no longer frequent this one at all.

a fast food joint in a gas station.
about as dumpy as you can get .
had a "b" rating from the health dept didn't speak hardly any english.
looked at me all dumb and then screwed up after taking 20 minutes by leaving out my pies.
i called back and everyone played the "no english" card hot & spicy chicken was good, buscuits are the bomb.
(they forgot the butter) (and forgot my pies) red beans & rice is good & spicy.
corn sucked-cold and undercooked.
better than kfc & churchs but still fast food chicken was good & hot but service & screwing up my order cost them

Poor customer service in Spanish AND English.
You just can't legislate or regulate against stupidity.
It is hard to manage a franchise operation, I know.
But with unemployment hovering at ten percent, I think this Popeye's can do better.
The chicken I'm not interested in fueling a brand loyalty debate.
It is what it is.
Spitefully overpriced, but each to his own as I prefer the flavor of the spicy.
But bad customer service in today's economy is UNFORGIVABLE.
I'm not talking about someone who can't speak in a language I understand (because they didn't realize it ... but I speak all languages spoken at this particular Popeye's) and I'm not talking about someone having a bad day at the register.
I'm talking about shameful, rude, arrogance beyond comparison.
No...I will never go back to this ghetto excuse for a Popeye's.
This chain restaurant franchise has earned my "Restaurant Most Deserving of Implosion" award for this year.
There is no excuse for the racism displayed by these people, and no excuse for the clowning around behind the counter in view of the customers whom you attach nicknames to.
Evil, evil people.
Grr.

LOVE Popeyes.
Pros: Best fried chicken there is.
The sides are AMAZING.
Takes me back to my roots.
Cons: Prices are a lot steeper than they used to be.
I've eaten so much Popeye's that I think a few years have already been trimmed off my life.........pretty good way to die I suppose.

I eat at KFC every now and then, so I was expecting the same if not better at Popeyes in Vegas, though as soon as I walked in, the menu seemed disappointing, mainly because it lacked the wide variety of options I'm used to seeing.
Anyways I went for the simple chicken and biscuits, and it tasted just as such, chicken and biscuits, neither special, or terrible, just average, and given the prices, its not worth it at all.
The Popeyes I went to regularly in Chicago makes this feel more like a dump then anything else.
Customer service wasn't very good either.
As the 2 star rating notes, "Meh.
I've experienced better.

I love popeyes chicken , but this location just doesnt stand up to the same type of service and food i have always recieved.
First off the employees were too busy sitting around and chitt chatting with each other , than worrying about their customers.
On top of that we ordered a BASIC meal 3 chicken strips fries and a drink.
However the 6 orders behind us were filled first , then ours....  how is this possible ?
Then once we recieved the food , it just did not taste good.
Luckily i do not live near this place and will not have to go again.

Service was terrible.
I was craving Popeyes today and I happened to be in Vegas visiting.
We went off the strip to this location hoping for some good ol Popeyes.
I was very disappointed.
First of all the cashier couldnt speak english but that really wasnt the problem.
The chicken was very dry.
It taste like it had been cooked in day old oil.
The mashed potatoes did not have enough gravy and the sandwich was sloppily put together.
They didnt even give me a napkin or fork when i was clearly eating in.
I went back to ask for sauce and they wanted to charge a quarter per packet!
Out of all the popeyes Ive eaten at Ive never had to pay for sauce and it wasnt even like I already had sauce and wanted extra.
If I could give this place a 0 i would.

My wife saw "Under cover boss" on TV, and decided to try Popeyes on 6111 W. Sahara Ave (ST # 5637) on 3/03/2012.. She was very excited and when she mentioned the TV program, she was met by a very Unfriendly, Rude, Ignorant and Strange attitude...it totally spoiled the whole experience and her appetite....never again.Tel ID LK940606 8 pce chick $14.39 mash $1.89 Tot $17.60 what a waist of time and money.

Fan of their food, but not the store, service, or parking.
Place gets packed on Tuesdays for their 2 piece deal.
Can't go wrong at this place for crispy chicken.
Location is pretty small (only a few tables).
Their fountain drinks are shared with Terrible's gas station (actually cheaper to buy a cup from Terrible's).
It's a fast-food joint, so you can't expect good service.
Always check to see if they gave you the correct number of pieces you ordered.
They don't offer you hot sauce or napkins, so you have to ask.
Parking here is a pain (especially on Tuesdays).

I love coming here on 2 piece Tuesdays !
You get two pieces for 99 cents!
I typically buy $10.00 worth for the week for every ones lunches.
It comes in handy when I'm dog tired from work and don't feel like cooking.
The best way to save is to make  the sides at home.
I'll usually pair it with rice,  mashed potatoes, or we will bake some Pillsbury biscuits at home.
It's a nice solid meal but it's best to get there early because the lines can get crazy!

Given the time I should up, (closing time) I got fast service.
And the girl behind the counter was really nice!

A big black Cockaroach ran across the the counter when we were placing our order.
we stop the order and went to Jack in the Box down the street.
I would not go back!
Stay away!

This popeyes is the worst.
Ordered a 12 piece only got 11.
I dont know if they cant count or what but I waited for about 15 min for my order.
Then the fries were gummy and tasted like fish.
Ok so moving forward when i got home and finally sat down and had a piece of chicken.
The inside of one of the pieces had so much coagulated blood it was disgusting.
Im not talking about a small spot the whole piece of chicken.
Needless to say as soon as i find the receipt i will be calling customer service because i refuse to drive back out in all that traffic.
A pure waste of money.
