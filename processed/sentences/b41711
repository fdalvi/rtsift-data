This facility is brand new and they convince you to drop on in for a $3 car wash.
I talked myself into the monthly pass so hopefully I can remember to get my moneys worth.
Last 2 visits to this place I have noticed that the front of my car isn't getting cleaned.
Still got bugs stuck on the front.
The guys direct you in and do a little pressure spraying on the front but I guess its not strong enough to do an effective job.
One thing I do like to is the vacuums.
They seam to be pretty powerful and I'm able to get my inside squared away.

I honestly wish you could give zero stars.
DO NOT purchase a monthly car wash from this company.
My son has literally been trying to cancel it for months.
We went in the first time and cancelled.
Went the next time and got documentation of the cancelation.
Still being charged so finally had to have the bank get involved and pay for a stop payment.
Its absurd how they handle this problem, I called corporate and they said he was still using the pass.
That's pretty difficult when his trucks transmission is out.
This is a complete scam.

This $3 wash is easily worth...
$4?...
It has brushes so I won't take my black vehicle here, but for the white sedan; perfeco!
You get what you pay for but don't be a moron and fall for the monthly deal, unless you'll really use it.
Per prior reviews there may be an issue with canceling memberships so maybe don't mess with it.
At $3 a pop, who needs an unlimited for whatever price they're charging?
This was created for a convenient & quick wash... that's it!!
Use it for such and you'll be pleased.
Good day!
