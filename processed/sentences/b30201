This place is awesome, had a small wreck and insurance totaled it.
I let Zen fix it out of my own expense and the price was very reasonable and my bike looks sexy as hell.
They spent extra time trying to make it look real nice.
Way better than other shops out there.
Labor was lower than all other shops I checked out.
thanks Dillon

I just had another tire replaced by Zen Moto.
I love these guys!
Quality work at a good price, real craftsmanship.

Thanks for taking great care of my bikes.
These guys are amazing.
Knowledge, super service and reasonable price.
You just can't do better than this shop.

Moved out from California a couple of years ago and had been looking for a shop where you can shake the owner/mechanics hand and know that you are paying him directly for the services provided.
This is the place.
Carbs serviced on a ninjette, CBR lowered for the wife, tires installed (Michelin sends me birthday cards because I buy so many).
Dillon is spot on and I'll continue to take my bikes to him.

Will come here again!
Really good customer service and very good work on my gsxr 750
