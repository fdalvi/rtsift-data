This place is the greek bizzity bomb!
Where I discovered the joy of gyros (but pre-Tzatziki sauce, they use some kind of honey mustard that was almost as good).
Great food.
Great Great food.

Whatever you are in the mood for, the Saz probably has it.
Very cheap with large portions...I once got the chicken curry for about $6 and it turned out to be half of a small chicken!!
Bare bones service, but the value is outstanding.
They have outdoor seating when it's nice, so opt for that.
Whatever you order, it's going to be good.

It's been a while since my last trip to the Saz, but as a freshman at Madison in the fall of '98, it was one of the first places I discovered on State Street.
Its simple decor and half-service atmosphere is great for the hungry-but-poor college student looking for a tasty variety of food in a quiet atmosphere.

One of the main reasons why I like the Saz, is because it is NEVER overwhelmingly busy.
There is always a place for you and three or five other friends to sit.
When Mediterranean Cafe has customers out the door, and the generic State Street food court crap won't do... this is when the Saz is the place to go.
(Motto:  The Saz, always the bridesmaid never the bride.
) Their selection of salads is reasonably priced and usually quite good.
The staff can sometimes be impatient if you don't know what you want right away  I have thoroughly enjoyed both their "Greek" fare and their "Mexican" themed items.
There is lots of vegetarian options, and they definitely have more than enough choices for the meat eaters.
The biggest problem I have with the Saz is they don't take credit cards.
I understand the food is quite cheap, but sometimes I'm a hungry girl with no cash and no ATM balance.
