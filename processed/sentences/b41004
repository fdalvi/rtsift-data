This place is small but there r lots of outfits and play toys.
The staff inside is wonderful very polite and she didn't bother me.
I just walked r looking at all the stuff.
The place is clean.

Omg!
This place is the best!
Even better than the website.
I love Antrece she is sooooooo help and laid back.
Give this woman a raise, best customer service!
She explains and shows you everything.
My husband and I will be returning for another purchase.

This place may be ok in person but DO NOT BOTHER BUYING ANYTHING FROM ADAM AND EVE OVER THE PHONE OR ON LINE.
The whole thing is literally a hoax.
they claim 24/7 customer service.
There is no possible way to reach a live person at any hour of the day.
I double dog dare you to try,  I have tried every which way possible.
I consider my self an expert at getting through phone trees and have successfully navigated even the toughest of phone trees in the recent past (EDD, DMV etc).
Adam and Eve overbilled me.
They took extra funds for supposed expedited shipping.
They provided UPS the wrong address.
Thier telephone tree says "this call may be recorded for quality assurance purposes".
It is a hoax to make the caller think they can actually speak with and interact with a live person on the other end, if need be.
There is absolutely no way to get through to a live person.
All other information is canned and generic in nature.,  There is no way to actually cancel an order, confirm delivery address, ask for a refund of expedited shipping funds or remedy a faulty product.
BUYER BEWARE!
There is no customer service available ever.
If you have a problem, the only recourse you would have would be to file in small claims court.
Do you really want to have to file a small claim for an ADAM and EVE product?
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE HOPING YOU WILL SAY.
Save your money and your sanity...go else where.
