I have been with B of A for roughly 15 years!
I have a credit card with them a savings and checking account.
I love being able to quickly & easily pay all my bills online.
I set them up and never have to worry about it again.
Their customer service it not that great!
It's very hard to talk to a real person.
Some area's the customer service is good (in house) but some area's of town, it's shotty...
This is an easy Bank which is what I like the most about them.
They make life very easy for you when it comes to banking and paying wills, etc...  Free notory, free cashier's checks, free coffee sometimes, if they have it!

need more $$$$$$$$$$ having such a good time on Mill

20 windows but only 2 tellers and a long line grrrr
