These guys are incompetent, unprofessional, and RUDE!!!
My wife took our 95 Toyota 4Runner to be smogged and the Tech failed the truck (after it passed the sniffer test) saying that it was supposed to have 2 catalytic converters.
The truck only has a single catalytic converter from the factory, and we verified this to him by calling the dealer in his presence.
We even told him to call himself and verify with the dealer.
It has never had a problem passing emissions with the single catalytic converter.
I have the carfax to prove it!
We immediately took it to another smog shop who said that the previous tech was incompetent and the vehicle is within spec.
Unfortunately the only ones who can give us an "exemption" are the techs at the DMV, since the vehicle has already been "black flagged".
So now I have to go appeal to the smog people at the DMV, and my vehicle has an emissions black flag on it's record.
The regional manager was at the shop when this all went down, and was just as rude.
Thanks to their incompetence hours of our time has been, and will continue to be wasted.

It was only $15 with the coupon from their website.
The man that did the smog check was friendly and fast, you couldn't ask for anything more.

Jim was absolutely fantastic in helping me with my oil change and setting up my groupon for unlimited oil changes for a year.

I just had one guy ahead of me.
Nice attendant and I saved $3 with a coupon that i printed from online ;)
