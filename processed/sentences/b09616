I am surprised I have never reviewed this place.
It is not a frequent stop, maybe twice a year.
I think I prefer the spices in KFC but Church's comes without all the grease.
This stop last Saturday about 12:30 I was second in line that turned in to about a dozen people and they had maybe six pieces of chicken in the serving trays so we all got to hang out for a while waiting for the chicken.

Churches chicken is better then KFC.
what else is there to say.
Also go to the website they have coupons there.
The spicy chicken is good.

I've been to many Church's Chickens and I like this one the best because I always get fresh chicken.
Besides that, the manger is super friendly and I always get extra strips :) or an upgrade for free!

OK didn't want to cook it was 10pm so thought pick up this to take home yule never go here.
Kfc is way better.
This place chicken sucks.
All there food sucks.
