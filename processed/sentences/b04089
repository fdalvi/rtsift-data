I was in the store for 20 minutes and no one acknowledged I was there.
No "hello" when I came in, and no one asked if I needed help.
I was the only customer in the store and there were 4 employees!
The only thing any of them said to me was the total cost for my stuff and then "sign here.
"  Two of the employees were watching the game on TV and the other two were having a personal conversation while they were ringing up my stuff.
I was treated as if my shopping in the store was an inconvenience to them!
Stay away!
I'll stick to the play it again Greenway instead!

Its simple.
So keep it simple when you go in.
Thrifty fun.
Some days you find stuff, some days you don't :)

Since the Gilbert location has closed.
The Tempe location has had more things to offer.
The staff has really stepped it up on customer service.
They do there best on helping you find whatever it is your looking for.

Friendly staff.
Small store, seasonal items go quickly.
Have snow gear now.
It's best to check it out before your sport season begins.

Bearded manager was kind of gruffy and staid, but I came in here for a cheap basketball and found one for $3.99.
They had basketballs starting at 8 bucks and higher also.
Mission accomplished I guess.
