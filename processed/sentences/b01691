The best bagels in the valley all start here.
And who doesn't love a bagel?
But this Chompie's isn't just about the bagels.
This is one of the best places for breakfast in the valley.
Corned beef hash, potato pancakes, chicken fried steak, and of course eggs served either traditionally w/ bacon to done w/ lox and onions served w/ a bagel.
I was surprised how good their pancakes were, but I realized I shouldn't be since they are a bakery and all.
Silly rabbit.
Hmmmm... strange concept.. Jewish deli for lunch..?
Rocks.
Super duper rocks.
Their reuben has been good to me.
And their patty melt is so freaking good.
Messy to the point you need extra napkins and maybe a spare shirt, but super good.
They also have an amazing selection of other desserts and baked goods.
I've never been disappointed.
And for you East coast transplants, you can also pick up some of your old East coast yummies here - say a bag of Wise potato chips?
Certainly made some of my peeps happy.
A great spot for a surprisingly good meal, or just a dozen bagels for the office.

HELLO CARB LOADERS!
This is your place to eat all the bagels you want.
What a yum-tastic bagel they serve.
I grew up on Chompie's bagels (this explains a lot).
There is something about the chewy moistness of the inside and the outside that feels and tastes toasted even though it's not.
Grocery stories sell them now but they really are not nearly as good as the FRESH ones in the actual Chompie's establishment.
