Sister business to another dry cleaner (I think the Fantastic Cleaners at 7865 W Sahara Ave), I used them on 17 Nov.
I paid for dry cleaning:  - Full suit (jacket + pants) $5.50 - Suit jacket $3.25 - Pair of pants $2.75 - Tie $2.75 - Long coat $15.00 (This seems expensive.
I'm not sure what other dry cleaners would charge to clean my overcoat).
Also, I paid $2 for them to repair/sew on a button to my pant's back pocket (I guess my butt's expanding faster than I thought).
5-stars because: - They offer same-day service (sign says in by 9 am, out by 5 pm).
- Offers dry cleaning and tailoring service that seem cheap (eg $3.99 to have pants hemmed).
- Friendly employees.
- Drive thru (under shade even) which allows me to pull my car up next to their front door, and the employee loaded my items in to my backseat on to the handle/hanger thing.
- All items are of course returned in that plastic/cellophane protector/bag and for suits they add this cardboard paper, origami-ish thing to the metal coat hanger so that the jacket's shoulder width are properly supported.

Excellent Value: - This is now my go-to spot for alterations and cleaning.
- I've used this place a few times since it opened up (I think in late 2011 or early 2012) and have always been satisfied with their service, prices are cheap and the staff friendly.
- For example: Tue/30 Apr I dropped off a men's white dress shirt to re-sew a button & to get it cleaned (including a soy sauce spot removal) and it'll be ready after 5 pm the next day.
Cost: $1.75.
- There's also a driveway/drive thru (under shade even) so you can pull your car up to their entrance.
Last time the female employee even helped me load my dry cleaned clothes in to the car.

Very nice employee service, and price is very worth for the quality

Located between Flamingo & Decatur, very close to my hotel Palm, I got several items in here for dry cleaning and they are very Reasonable and FAST!
They did a great job with my dress shirts, Friendly!

Has a fabulous quality to wash my shirt on my second visit.
I thought it's the best place to clean ur clothes in Las Vegas.
