3.5 stars.
Decent Italian deli, but kind of new age design.
They have a lot in the deli case, meaning sandwiches and pre-made salads(which I cannot comment on), but I was not impressed with the lack of Italian grocery items.
That part seemed sort of half assed to me.
They have frozen lasagna (kinda pricey), homemade sauce (reasonable), pizza crusts (cheap), and cheese (moderate).
Worth a drop in.

Truly wonderful spaghetti and lasagna.
I've been there twice and have been impressed with the food and the service

Gino's Italian Deli on Century Avenue is my go-to option for any time I don't feel like cooking or if I'm in the mood for an excellent sandwich.
In college I worked at a similarly-themed restaurant/deli so my expectations weren't too high when after college I moved out to Middleton.
I knew of the place and had driven by it multiple times but had never stopped until a fortunate visit from my father.
After helping me move a couch, my father took a look at my spartan apartment and said, "Well at least you're pretty close to the Middleton Gino's.
"  Upon learning that I hadn't ever been to either the deli locations or the State Street restaurant he insisted on getting subs that night.
Even four years later I can still remember how satisfying it was.
Over the years I've moved several times but I've never strayed too far from Gino's.
I enjoy the hot subs to such an extent that I haven't managed to work my way through the menu yet, but here are a few of my favorites.
My standard order is the Italian beef with giardinera peppers, provelone and a dip.
I couple this with a quarter pound of the Cajun chicken salad and I'm set.
I've gotten into a few disputes over the authenticity of the #12 Italian beef compared to the Chicago standards, but I believe you like what you were introduced to and for me this is the best it gets.
The #11 meatball sub is another favorite, so much so that I usually have a hard time deciding when I get up to the counter.
The cold subs on the menu are not to be overlooked either, although I find myself doing this all the time.
My personal favorite is the #14 artichoke & turkey.
The sweet and spicy honey mustard on this is perfect with the artichoke hearts and cucumbers, and this sandwich keeps well in the refrigerator so I like to take this in for lunch.
The #7 roast beef is great in it's simplicity - just thinly sliced beef with lettuce and horseradish sauce.
I like to pick up Gino's before heading over the Capital Bier Garten to meet up with friends and family, and the #7 tastes incredible with Capital Fest and 1900 (RIP).
Gino's is more than just sandwiches.
The lasagna is very well done and the fire chicken is a special treat.
When I get subs for dinner I often pick up a piece of lasagna for lunch the next day.
Just cut it in half and microwave it for three minutes.
I've also gotten a refrigerated pan of lasagna and cooked it for a big dinner before, and it turned out very well.
There is a decent selection of dry goods and sauces on the shelves, but being not so much of a cook myself I can't say I've tried any.
One thing to note - there is a cash discount so you can save a bit.
The prices are pretty cheap to begin with: my usual order of a #12 with Cajun chicken salad and lasagna for the next day comes in around $10.
There are times that I get bored with Middleton compared with downtown Madison, but having Gino's nearby makes it all worth it.

The food at Gino's is unbelievable.
The pasta sauces and made-to-order sandwiches are delicious, but the lasagna stands out from everything else.
It is a bit pricey, but easily worth it.
The pasta salads are somewhat oily but very flavorful.
Generally when I order a pasta salad it ends up looking better than it tastes, but not so at Gino's.
I highly recommend checking this place out.

My first Gino's experience was at the Verona Rd location, and I was in love(Hello...offer me Greek salad with chunks, not crumbles, of feta and I'm yours forever).
You can imagine my excitement when we moved to Middleton...a block away from the Century Ave.
location!!!
This store seems a bit smaller than the other, but just as high quality.
Great sandwiches, and you can purchase the tasty meats and cheeses that they use.
We get the half baked loaves of bread on occasion...mmmm.
I've also heard that the lasagna is hearty and delicious.
Will be popping in soon for a pan full.

At first glance you might not look at Gino's and think "Let's go there for lunch!.
" But think again.
Gino's serves up some of the best on-the-go sandwiches I've found in Madison.
I love the veggie sandwich--it is packed with loads of flavorful ingredients like olives and artichoke hearts and a zingy vinaigrette, all delicious wheaty bread.
Very reasonably priced!
The market is noteworthy as well, offering all you authentic Italian culinary needs.
Plus, there is a great selection of prepared foods (fresh and frozen) that will jump out an you and call "dinner.
" I've tried the lasagna and wasn't disappointed.
It came with a huge portion of french bread.
The staff at Gino's is always friendly and helpful.

Gino's deli is awesome!
It's not a truly "authentic" Italian deli, but it's as close as you're going to get in suburban Middleton.
The subs are invariably excellent; the bread is high-quality and the meats are delicious.
The cheese tastes mainly of salt but, then again, I've never actually had a sub where the cheese is anything but mediocre.
Anyway, you can't go wrong with any of the sub choices.
I particularly recommend the Italian beef or the Italian.
The pasta dishes are also great.
I've been having the ravioli since I was a kid (and the Middleton Gino's was located on Allen Boulevard) and it's always been a favorite of mine.
I also really like the chicken alfredo penne; it's pretty garlicky but absolutely delicious.
There are also some cold pasta salads that are worth checking out.
If you have a family to feed, Gino's sells premade pans of meat lasagna (they require 24 hours notice to make vegetarian).
It is some of the best lasagna I've ever had.
They are very generous with the meat sauce, which is great news for carnivores like me.
Gino's sells a few boxed pastas and some pasta sauces as well.
The selection is similar to what you'd find at a grocery store with only a few interesting products, so it's not worth coming here just to check out the grocery.
However, if you're just here to pick up some lunch, it could be worth your while to pick up a few other things too; the prices for everything are pretty reasonable, and the discount you get for paying with cash makes it even better.
If you are the Middleton area (or even if you aren't) you should make it a point to check out this place.

Their lasagna is awesome.
I brought it over to a friends house for a pot luck and we all now call it "crack lasagna", and giggle a little bit.
It's good stuff, watch out you'll be hooked.

I only ever get the #1 here (Italian).
Because it's good and I like it and what's wrong with that?
There's one guy who makes them better than the others, so I like it when he's there.
I think he puts just the perfect amount of dressing on.
Nothing extraordinary here, but a solidly good sandwich that I can't pass up when I'm in the neighborhood.

Really great subs.
One downside is if I'm really hungry one sub doesn't quite cut it.
Love the lasagna too.
The meat lasagna is actually MEAT lasagna.
Or maybe meat disk lasagna.
(its very meaty) They have some good take and bake dinners, some Italian grocery items like olive oils, pickled veggies, sauces, etc.

I have been going to Gino's for a very long time and still love it!
In fact now that I live in Chicago it has become a ritual that my mom brings a pound of the tortellini salad every time she visits.
Great prepared salads, fresh bread and awesome lasagna!
Pick it up, you won't be disappointed!

My family and I have been regulars at Ginos in both Middleton and on Verona Road for years.
Both are our go-to places for a quick lunch/dinner or for big family parties.
It's always reliable and the staff is friendly too.
I love ginos!

Really tasty subs!
I'd hate to see the calorie count for a sub here, though.
They have super fast service.
We also have gotten the bake-at-home lasagna at their Century Ave location in Middleton.
It's a little price but very good!

I must say that I was disappointed by my experience.
I won't mention the presentation of the lasagna I received after it is a fast service and in that essence taste is by far the experience I am purchasing.
I purchased a slice of lasagna with a slice of garlic bread and a salad entree along with a Sicilian sub (several meats cheese lettuce tomato banana peppers green onion italian dressing too i think).
The sub was all right but I must say that Jimmy John's served a much better version of the same sandwich.
The garlic bread was soggy (they wrap it in plastic and microwave it) and almost devoid of the desired garlic flavor.
The lasagna was alright.
I have had much better lasagna in many other venues especially my own homemade lasagna (not trying to toot my own horn).
They do you big pieces of meat that are nice to pop in your mouth but the sauce did not quite have the appropriate flavor.
I know generalities on the flavor but I'm writing this a day after the fact.
The salad entree is a choice from several.
I chose a tortellini salad with red pepper olives and parsley tossed in what tasted like an italian dressing.
It was the brighter spot of the meal but I would choose a different option if I went back (though I am pretty sure I won't...
I might try a different location sometime, Perhaps it was an off day for lasagna or they don't make it as well in Verona, idk).
So overall, I'd give this a B.
Fun to try new things though so give it a shot if your in the mood.

I have wondered what this place was like for a long time--Glad I listened to the fellow yelpers.
The meat lasagna was marvelous!
We have a great family recipe and are always very critical of other lasagnas--as many others know few can compare to a good homemade lasagna but this one is outstanding.
Try it out some night, stop in and pick up the premade lasagna, cook it at home for the family.
It was $19 for a platter that could feed a family of 6 comfortably.
You could also get the individual serving to taste if you don't believe me.

Love this place, and so does everyone I tell about it.
I've been going here for 17 years, and never tire of their offerings.

Cool local Deli, fast service, good sandwiches.
Take out.

Amazing, amazing, amazing.
Great selection of salads, meats and to-go pastas and Italian entrees, all with high-quality ingredients.
The subs are awesome (my fave is the #4 on Italian) - even the small is large enough to for a satisfying lunch.
Be sure to get a slice of turtle cheesecake for dessert... it's a slice of heaven.
Oh, and bring cash to pay instead of credit - you'll save some coin with their cash discount.

I LOVE Gino's and started enjoying their subs, salads, and lasagna over 10 years ago.
I moved out of state a few years ago and always made a point to stop at Gino's to grab my favorite sub when I was home visiting.
The lasagna also quickly became the staple that my mom made the nights we flew back to visit.
We now have moved back to the area and I am happy to say that nothing has change at Gino's.
The same friendly staff, and my favorite sub is still perfect.

I have been coming here for years, not sure why I have not done a review.
This place is always solid, never had something that wasn't good.
Sandwiches beat the pants off other sub places, and I can't seem to get out of the place without a container of Cajun Chicken Salad.
Soups are good, entrees are good.
If you need a quick lunch or dinner that won't break the bank this is a good option.
They also give you a discount for paying cash, another plus.
Try them, you'll like them!

First sandwich I had here...  a "Pastrami Plus" on Asiago bread....  was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.
OK..  maybe I'd been craving a pastrami sandwich for a week or two.
Every moment.....
In any case, that sandwich blew me away.
I couldn't believe it!
For $6 (maybe not even that!
) I'd gotten a sandwich that lined right up with Bari in Chicago.
I called all my friends.
Asked my girlfriend if she'd consider moving up to Madison.
We could stay.
There was a good sandwich place.
Then it all fell apart.
I went back the next day, and wished I'd gone to Cousin's.
Went back two more times over the next two weeks and for some reason they just couldn't duplicate that first one.
I don't know what to say.
I mean...  they weren't *bad*, just disappointing after that first one that was just *so* freaking good.
I also had their veggie lasagna once, on the recommendation of a friend (who raves about it btw).
Honestly, I wasn't impressed, but I'll admit that making lasagna is "my thing" so I sort of resent when it's anything less than 5 stars.
Anyway, for the friendly people, the cheap prices, and that first sandwich...  3 stars to you, Gino's.
Occasionally I'll be back....  like a long-lost lover returning to the place he met an old love whom he never saw again.

Whether you want a pan of lasagna or a quick sandwich, this is your place to go.
This is more of a 'pick up and take home' type place, but they do have a couple small tables if you're on the go.
You get a discount if you pay cash instead of a credit card...
Which for me is totally understanding.

It was average.
Not quite the same as italian delis in Chicago, but ok, I guess.

AWESOME lasagna!!
I could probably eat a whole pan of it by myself in one sitting, however my wife would probably divorce me, so i reluctantly choose to eat it in moderation.

Stopped here during our lunch break.
Both of us loved our subs.
I got the Sicilian on asiago bread.
Absolutely amazing!!!!
Best bread I've ever had with a sub.
Also got the grilled chicken pesto salad which was also very good.
Prices are very cheap also.
Can't wait to go back.

Who knew?
No seriously... Who knew this was here?
Solid marketplace for on the fly Italian ingredients and a decent Italian beef sammie.
Wish there was more space to eat than the two tables which practically feel outside given the draft, but I think this could quickly be a great grab-n-go option for me on that side of town.

"I wanna be a meatball from Gino's" Sandwiches, meatballs, homemade lasagna, cheese, and the oh so famous chicken pesto salad.
It's all good.
If you are picking up lunch or dinner from here, please let me know so I can swing by.
When you walk in and smell that perfect Italian Deli scent, you know you're in the right place!

Great prices, efficient service, and really good food!
We got the meatball, italian beef, and sicilian-- all of which were really flavorful and did not skimp on the toppings.
The sicilian was probably the least favorite of the three, but still was enjoyable.
The italian beef was loaded with beef, but some of it was slightly fatty.
The meatball had several meatballs, not dry at all, and the marinara was excellent.
Great experience overall.

I love this place!
It's where I stop every time I visit Madison.
Great subs, great family business.

I had the Italian Sub.
Tasty.
Quick service, quality ingredients and locally owned.
Enjoy;)

Love love loveeeee Gino's!
If I could afford to take the entire store home I would!!!
You can not go wrong with anything on their menu but their turtle cheesecake is to die for!

Hidden gem.
Meatball sub is fire!

Delicious Sicilian sub and Greek pasta salad.
As soon as you walk in the smell grabs you.
They also offer a cash discount.
I can't wait to go back to try something else on their menu.
The pastrami sub will probably be my next choice.

Really cute deli my family always stop at on our way to the cabin.
It has frech delicious food.
And the interior is really pretty.
Get your sandwhich on the asiago bread.
Delicious!
