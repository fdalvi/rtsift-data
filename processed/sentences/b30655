Aloha Las Vegas Yelpers!!!
Happy 2011!
I've been living in LV for a month now and I was excited to find me a new church home.
I attended New Hope of Hilo (Big Island,Hawaii) years ago when I lived in Hilo and I decided to do a little research to see if there was a branch here in Vegas... after a minute of searching online, I found Las Vegas New Hope :D  I've been going the last 2 Sundays and plan on going every Sunday.
They have a 9am and 11am Sunday Morning service.
Everyone at the church is really nice and most of the members are from Hawaii.
Pastor Kent Miyoshi from Oahu/Hawaii is a really down to earth pastor, super friendly and always welcoming.
The praise and worship team is great.
So if you're looking for a Christian church with a touch of Aloha... New Hope Las Vegas is the place to be on Sunday mornings!
They also have a youth, men and women ministry!
So there's something for everyone.
Bring your bible, sing a little, pray, fellowship with your brothers and sisters in Christ and give thanks to God!
Come as you are.
God is Good... All the time!
All the time... God is Good!
Amen!
See you in church!

That's my Church!!!!
Cheehoo!
Having grown up in Hawaii, I attended New Hope at Farrington High School for a little bit and then Windward New Hope at Castle High School a little before moving here to Las Vegas, and found New Hope Las Vegas back in 2003.
I started attending again a little before they found themselves a new home here at The River.
I am so glad I found a new home for church!

I love this church because it reminds me of home.
If you are from Hawaii and have been looking for a church that has the same warmth and love as New Hope Christian Fellowship on O'ahu, you will be "home" at New Hope Las Vegas.
