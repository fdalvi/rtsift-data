Dr Boesel seemed rushed and made a joke at my expense to his staff.
I am not sure if it was an ill timed attempt at humor or if he is just a douche bag.
Needless to say, I was not amused and I will not be back to find out.
Aside from that experience, I was very pleased with the facility and staff.

I see my doctor at the Scottsdale office but get shots here so this pertains only to the allergy shot lab.
The ladies are friendly and efficient.
No complaints at all.

Although I generally see Dr. Erdos at the Scottsdale location, I get my allergy shots at this location.
Occasionally, when I don't feel like schlepping to two different offices, I'll see a doctor at this location.
I saw Dr. Ching last week and she was fantastic.
Extremely knowledgeable, thorough, and recognized a recommendation from my ENT was in my file and addressed it with me because it's a specialty of hers.
Much like Dr. Erdos, she provided an excellent level of care and I would not hesitate to see her again.

They have been great with my daughter!
We see MD Jorgensen and they are very professional and courteous here.

The worst allergy place around.
Very unprofessional staff as they lack tact, finesse and have poor communication skills with patients like myself.
After a year and a half, I was informed that I was being discharged from this outfit for unknown reasons with no prior warnings at all and the doctor never even gave me a phone call!
They have a lot of nerve and frankly I don't need them.
Avoid at all costs and seek allergy treatments elsewhere.
Not recommended ever!!!!!
