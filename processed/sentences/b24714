Awesome staff and doctor.
I've been "catching up" on way overdue mouth work at Agave and I am so happy I have found a place where I don't dread going to.
The doctor is awesome at what he does and the staff is very friendly and welcoming.
I highly recommend this place to anyone in Casa Grande looking for a dentist!

This was the best dental experience of my life!
I had a wisdom tooth that needed to be extracted and I was in a lot of pain.
I was also six months pregnant so I was very nervous.
I went to a dentist that would not extract the tooth but instead set up an appointment with an oral surgeon, which sounded costly and unnecessary - not to mention the soonest I could see him was 2 weeks!
So we made some calls and got a hold of Agave Dentistry and they were able to see me in the same day!
Dr. Davis and his assistant were so thorough in explaining the procedure that I felt very calm.
To make a long story short, I thought I would be in a lot of pain so he wrote me a subscription, but I never needed it because the procedure was so successful.
I highly recommend anyone to go to Agave Dentistry.
Pros:  - Same day service - Professional, clean and attractive office without being over the top fancy like so many dentists offices are (no wonder I feel like those other dentists are charging me way to much) - Friendly staff - Dr. Davis is very knowledgable, thorough and has a great calming personality (I usually dread going to the dentist, but I was surprised at how comfortable and at ease he and his staff made me feel)  Cons- none

Friendly staff, knowledgable doctor, and clean office.
I had a front tooth repair that was done quickly and perfectly.
I wish I could post a before and after pic.
It was impressive and feel like smiling again.
