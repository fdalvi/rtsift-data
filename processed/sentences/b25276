I came here to buy some shisha and coals.
The place is in an older complex, tucked away right in the corner.
It didn't have the biggest selection.
:( They had mostly Fantasia and Al Fakher and a few weird flavors of Starbuzz left.
But they had Three Kings coals so I was excited about that!
:) The prices here were reasonable unlike many of the other smoke shops in the area.
Overall, small selection of Starbuzz but good deals.
Let me know if there's something better out there.

I dropped by just to pick up some papers.
Their music was up pretty loud, and the joint was totally empty.
The chick behind the counter was nice, though no salesman.
She made no effort to show me anything or sell me anything, even though I'm always open to new goodies.
Their pipe selection wasn't bad, though I've definitely seen better.
Overall, it was a substandard shop and the biggest factor for my dropping by was convenience.
I'll probably look elsewhere for future head shopping needs.

Came in the other day to buy my first ecig and was really happy.
The owner helped me out with all the questions I asked and knew a lot about them.
The other shops I went to had the same ecigs for a lot more so was happy to get a good deal.
He sold me one of the ejuices they make and it's amazing.
I would suggest this shop over any other shop

WOW!!!
Stopped in here for tobacco and ended up leaving with an e-cig and the best tasting e-juice EVER (you have to try Jamaican Cheesecake and Twisted Ice Cream).
Great selection of glass and knowledgeable staff.
Pretty much everything in there is local, too.
I was amazed!

If you are going to post your hours of operation you should at least be open/on site during those hours.
I showed up at 9:30, happy to get my day started and to come across the one smoke shop in Tempe open earlier than 10am just to find that the doors were locked, with no one inside.
Very disappointing.
