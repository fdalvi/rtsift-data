This pool is not your typical Vegas strip resort pool but more like a family type of pool without the drinking, loud music and fancy decor.
The entrance to the pool is right near the lobby elevators so it's much better then walking across the casino or a long walkway to get to the pool but to enter you just slide your room key into the gate like you would in a Super 8 motel.
The size of the pool is just average and not really exciting but it does the job and it's mostly full of families with young children and nothing exciting really.
3 Stars for the cleanliness of the pool compared to other pools I've been in in Vegas and minus 1 star for the entrance and minus for the size.

Met up with the girls during the Burlesque Hall of Fame.
We had a cabana and the attendants were AWSOME.
It's been a while since I've been in a pool.
It was clean and not too crowded, all things considered.
You can order food from the cabana, like a tray of assorted sandwiches for $28, but I would suggest heading into the casino to grab a bite at the food court and bring it back to the cabana.
They have bottle service, as well.
We had that handled, so we were brought plenty of water and buckets of ice.
Oh!
And ice towels!!!
I will always get the cabana.
