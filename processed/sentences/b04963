This is about as good as McDonald's gets in Las Vegas.
Sometimes they forget things in my order, but everybody is friendly, fast and the food is always cooked properly.
It's weird how the ingredients at one location can vary so much.
Everything is always fresh here.

Food took a while it was at night I was looking at apartments on that street all the way up the street but this is the only McDonalds in the vicinity and there's no other real restaurant in for a mile or two going up to Henderson

Normally, I try to stay away from fast-food in general and McDonald's specifically.
However, whenever I have a craving for McDonald's, this particular location is my favorite.
They do brisk business so all my meals were hot and fresh.
Inside the restaurant is cleaner than most other stores and the staff have been mostly friendly and helpful.
You should expect a wait in the drive-through, but that just means your order will most likely be just-made and hot (think fries).

Hair was found in food replaced it but made me feel like the bad guy about it.
Not cool guys
