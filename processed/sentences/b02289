I recently had to try to get a replacement battery for "she who wants to be free's" cell phone.
I admit to being a bit pessimistic that they would have a battery for the LG Vu.
Arriving near opening, I was glad to see the shop open and actually staffed by someone who had an interest in customer service.
I hope I don't butcher the managers name, I believe I remember it as Perri, but given my advanced state of forgetfulness, it could be Penny or Janice.
The manager took the time to find a battery (online not in store) and have it shipped directly to the apartment, saving me a possible multi-hour/day trip to superstition springs mall center.
She was also very knowledgeable, providing honest opinions on a number of my other questions.
In short, a very nice experience during a very stressful week.

So here's the deal.
I walked in the store, a person greeted me (good) and asked what I needed (also good).
Here is where it gets bad.
Now I have to admit that I just got done working out at this new and might I add awesome place .....
I will write about that later, so I was a little "un-kept".
Hair a bit messy, workout clothes on, slight smell.....but anyway, the sales pitch began.
Right off the bat I could tell that she worked off of commission.
Do you really need to be THAT desperate?
What kind of plan do you have, I can up-grade you, blah, blah, blah, nothing she said was really that bad or unexpected, it was just the condescending way in which she was saying it.
Like I said, I didn't look like a super model, BUT I have been into other ATT stores and have been treated very well wearing a similar gym inspired outfits.
Basically the lady hated her job and was trying to get me to spend mega $$ on something I didn't want or need and when I told her what I really wanted and needed....i.e.
a phone that has just the basics (I'm not that tech savvy and I am constantly breaking them) she just became rude, as if she had something better to do than show me a couple of freaking phones.
Now I could have been a little understanding if the store was busy, but it wasn't.
Only myself and one other customer were there.
That was the point where I just walked out with no phone in my hand:( I will just order it online.
It boggles my mind that in this economy sales people can afford to be rude to potential clients.
I'm sorry but I went in expecting service, choosing to go to their physical location to purchase a phone.
I should have just stayed at home and ordered it online.
