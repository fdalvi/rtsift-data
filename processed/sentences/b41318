A fanTAStic convenience store in the far northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada, this convenience store has EVERYTHING you'd expect and more!
Starting with the personnel, clean cut, friendly folks that are eager to please.
Fountain sodas: One of those fancy Coke machines that not only have the different sodas, but can add different flavors to all of them (lemon, cherry, vanilla, and more!
) as well as Powerade, Dasani waters, and more!
(with FAT straws, too!
) Hot coffee: multiple flavors, brews, and locales, there are flavored creamers and multiple types of sugar to add a little bit of oomph!
to your java.
Candy's, chips, Icees, sodas, beer and wine, ice and ice cream, there's even a "malt" machine where you mix your own flavors of milkshakes!
Sinclair gasoline, car wash, and someday a restaurant with drive thru, this Desert Pit Stop convenience store is a fantastic welcome addition to the Providence area of Las Vegas.

DON'T GAMBLE HERE!
It sucks!!!
I stupidly have and keep gambling here every day since it opened and haven't won once!
I have a lot of experience with gambling, as I have been gambling for over a decade, and I have never been to a place where I never win like this one.
I gamble everywhere in town, and I am not a bitter looser but I have never seen a place suck like this to gamble, as no matter where I have played in Las Vegas and lost, I eventually win something, even if little, and as much as I have put in daily, I have not won once!!!
The most I have seen someone else win there is $40.00.
I think because it's a new business, the owner is trying to recover the costs of his new business, by keeping the money from the machines the first 6 months to recover some of the money he spent.
By law I think they are allowed to keep 40% of what the machines take in, and pay out 60% or it could be the other way, either way I think he is holding out till he has to pay.
DON'T GAMBLE HERE.

****************************************************** DO NOT USE THE CARWASH IT WILL DAMAGE YOUR CAR!!!!!!
******************************************************      I am so disgusted at the way I was treated!
I wish I could empty my gas tank out for this car and 2 other vehicles!
I was ecstatic to know a new gas station had opened and was so close to Home!
I did my normal gas fill up which became a habit for me and household of 3 cars to do here.
Today I tried the car wash and the $9.00 car wash bent my license plate!
A common, no fancy plate, or license plate cover.
I tried to get help before I came into the car wash pushing the help button and NO one came no one came on intercom.
I went through it with absolutely no help!
This is not the first self car wash I go Into and nothing like this had happened.
A gentleman came out when I told him my dilemma and he said we warn you about damage, I'm telling you just to tell you just to tell you just to tell you ..
I haven't even finished and he is already giving excuses!
He tried to bend back my plate and said to take it off at home and bend it out and left back in store no bye, no I'm sorry absolutely nothing I turned around he was GONE!
So incredibly rude!
This location lost $300 every week coming in from all my household cars!
A simple here's your $9 back would of sufficed.
I paid $9 to have my license plate bent and my car was not sufficiently cleaned at all!
The worst lack of service and RUDE!
I wish I could give it negative stars!!!
