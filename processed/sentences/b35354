I love trying out new nail salons in my area.
I had a coupon for a special they were running.
32.99 for fill and spa pedicure...not a bad deal.
The decor is very nice, the spa chairs looked new and the nail tables looked kept.
Tony my master nail tech did a great job.
Didn't rush my services and didn't try to sell me the gel or the newest thing which instead of costing 19.00 it's 35.00.
I hate that.
My spa pedicure was kinda of relaxing, loved the massage chair, but the big screen TV was dominated by their son so we all watched cartoons.
I got the regular pedicure and no special services like hot rock massage were added.
It was pretty basic.
I know other salons in the area usually add that service as part of the basic package.
It would of been nice if they offered water.
All in all, I got exactly what I wanted and they did a great job.

I would NOT recommend this place for a pedi!
I could've done a better job myself.
Looks like a 2 year old painted my toes.
