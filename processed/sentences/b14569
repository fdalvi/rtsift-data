Just what the name says: Fast.
Clean.
Car wash.
I like how I can stay in the car and get a thorough car washing for $9.99 that includes my tires.
PLUS, free vacuums for the inside!
It's a spacious carport that offers many vacuum stations - for free!
Nice.
I come here for my regular washes.
The kids have fun riding through the car wash too!

$5 in & out.
If your the person who's looking for every little spot to be washed away from your vehicle you might wanna get your ride detailed, that means take it elsewhere.
This place is a self serve location.
washes cars pretty good too so when I need a little clean between detailing this is a good spot.
They have a whole role of vacuums on the side of the building (For those do it your selfers) and you can really get your whip looking so fresh and so clean.

Do not wash your car at this place.
The owner Matt never answers his phone or returns calls.
He also will over charge your credit card and not make it right.
This place is no good be warned.

I got the 9.99 car wash which is the best one you can get and my car is not too clean which it wasn't like it was too dirty to begin with and there was a guy standing inside the car wash to make sure everything was working properly I'm assuming we'll to say the least the tire shine didn't work either worst car wash I have ever paid for.
I do not recommend this place to anyone.
Waste of mo ey!
And they don't even answer the phone when you call!
