Excellent sushi.
Menu items are also very good.
Small interior.
Nice sushi bar as well as the restaurant.
Staff very friendly and attentive.
Reasonably priced.
Nice central location in North Scottsdale.
Good ambience.

I have been to Sushi on Shea several times, and have always been impressed with the food, service,and the food again.
Service has always been first class, the sashimi is fresh, and the sushi is expertly made.
For Phoenix, Sushi on Shea is probably one of the better sushi places around.
Unlike overrated places like Stingray, you don't see or have to deal with the Scottsdale rif raf.
Plus, the food is actually good.
What a concept.
The people that go here understand the quality of the sushi.
Plus, it's never terribly busy.
I say kudos to Sushi on Shea, I'll be coming back again!

Some of the worst food I have ever had I would never recomend this to anyone.
Go to Sakana or Hiro Sushi

Pretty good sashimi, their signature rolls..not so much.
Great service, overall a good restaurant.

I went  to this place with my newly transplanted Phoenix friends who found this place to be pretty unique.
The wait staff were very friendly and the sushi chef could not be more accomodating to fill any special requests.
However, there were some really good rolls and not so good rolls.
How can there be such an unequal balance?
The Good Ones: Zen Moment - Heavenly, I'll take a seared tuna on a roll anyday.
Samba Roll - Special roll for the night with special tempura, jalapeno, and cream cheese.
So tasty that we asked for 2 orders.
Strawberry field - Save this one for last due to its sweetnees, it's good, but minus the banana as its way overpowering, my friend swears that it didn't have banana on it when she ordered it before.
Appetizers: Gyoza - Friends loved it.
Crispy and tasty.
Ika Tempura -  My first time eating big Calamari steaks without the fringey legs and it was great!
Skip these: Caterpillar Roll - Very disappointing, there was no wow to it.
Salmon Skin - Special order, but way too fishy Mas Vegas - Too big and too bland.
While you could find better sushi, this is one of the better places and my friends will definitely be back.

Yummy!!
Went with my best friend last night for our weekly date and had a great meal!
We enjoyed the sushi menu but everything looked quite delicious.
I LOVED the welcoming sushi chefs and beautiful aquariums.
Here is a rundown of the food...  Edamame: solid...can't really screw that one up Philly: Great distribution of cream cheese!
I hate when sushi places over do it on the Philly... California: Solid but could have been a bit creamer and with some spicy sauce  Some kind of Latino roll: Skip it...weird texture inside Scallop roll: Yummm  Great experience and so far maybe the best sushi I have come across in AZ.
I will keep you posted

I absolutely love the yellowtail here - it is sooooo fresh and melts in your mouth.
I also just sampled the baked mussels appetizer - the restaurant now offers a free appetizer coupon which can be downloaded on the site.
The mussels were extremely yummy.
I haven't had anything here I didn't enjoy.
It's a bit pricey but well worth it.
I will check out the new Happy Hour and lunch specials when I get a chance.

I thought this place was alright.
If someone wanted to check it out I would go back but I wouldn't recommend it when picking a place to eat.
The menu is kind of small and there is really only sushi which is fine but if you have a non-sushi eating person in the group this place would not work.
We went here on a sunday afternoon at noonish and stayed for quite awhile....no one else came in while we were there.
This sort of freaked me out.
Anyway the sashimi and sushi were fine.
Nothing amazing but not bad at all.
The one thing I did not like was the spicy tuna roll was pretty big.
I can't stand that.
Anyway, its ok.
Check it out and decide for yourself.

There aren't many sushi restaurants with high-quality ingredients and a well-designed menu selection in the area; this is one of the better spots.
But OH MY the server, a young woman I'd bet was used to getting by on her looks, took more than 40 minutes to bring our sushi combo platter and roll.
I actually had to get up and ask her where our dinners were before she brought them, sans apology.
Drinks were slow too.
And in case you're wondering, it was a Friday night dinner, but an early one.
The place was not busy enough to excuse the service, even a little.

Thank the mooses, we've finally found a decent, affordable, not too yuppy sushi place in this state.
We found it by accident; some out of town friends inviting us out the dinner.
After our terrible sushi experiences were, I'll admit, I was nervous!
I mean, we've have fish scales in food, 3 hour long waits and more.
Not here.
They have a huge menu of both sushi and other Japanese delights, and between the four of us, we tried a lot.
Let's break it down: Edamame -- perfect.
Goyza -- not bad.
Eggplant in ginger miso - DELICIOUS and gone in 2.5 seconds.
Cold tofu w/  ginger -- not worth it.
Wouldn't order it again.
Could make it at home easily.
Yakisoba -- Lots of veggies, lots of noodles.
Great!
Philly roll -- delicious Sweet potato roll - AMAZING Avocado roll - MASSIVE amounts of avocado, greats size, great taste Spicy tuna roll - Tasty Sprimp tempura roll - Yummy The weird "mountain potato and sour plum sauce" veggie roll -- sour, salty and sweet all in one.
None of the three of us liked this one, but it was worth a try.
The service was pretty snappy, although our server did have to go back and ask a question or two.
Overall?
A great time, with good service, delicious food (and fresh tasting fish, according to my co-diners), and very affordable when the final bill came.
I just wish we lived closer...although that could be dangerous!

Love this homey sushi spot.
I am not a big fan of all the fancy rolls, but I find this place comfortable, consistent, and a good value.

I cant believe I am just now writing a review for this wonderful place.
This is the place that started my love for sushi!
While on one hand I should love that.. on the other it bums me I can not have it daily lol.
I found this place while working a few years ago servicing their fire equipment, and afterwards came in and tried it.
The owner is a very very accommodating and polite woman and the sushi has been the best I have enjoyed locally.
Sadako "the owner" has a place that is not only serves great sushi and rolls but does so at a fair price.
The edamame here is just right and place is clean, appealing, good for a quick lunch or a nice candle lit dinner with your significant other.
The large fish tank near the back is pretty nice to look at too.
Ill be back soon for sure!
5 stars, support this business for sure.

I haven't been a fan of sushi for very long, but this place has fueled my new craving for it.
The food is just as great as the service!
Highly recommended.

I love this place, we have had many great dinners here over the years.
I think only once was i kind of upset eating here.
It had nothing to do with the food or service, it was the crowd!
What do you expect though?
Even a Japanese tour bus stopped by and all were very pleased with the menu and food.
I am in the Bay Area and the owner always recognizes us and comes over to chat.
Also I love the saltwater tanks with the exotic fish swimming around.

The best sushi restaurant in Phoenix!
Always come back here when visiting Phoenix.
Spicy tuna roll is the best!
Waitstaff is great.
My teenagers and I just love this place!

We arrived before 3  on a Sunday, so technically they were not open for dinner, but we were warmly welcomed and treated to some sakis left over from a tasting held last night.
We had the Shabu-shabu, which was amazing, and the yellow tail sashimi was melt in your mouth delicious.
I had soft shell crab, and we shared the spicy salmon roll...fantastic dinner beginning to end!!!
At the end of the meal, we were treated to some soy milk dessert saki...great send off!

It was around 9:20 pm on a Friday, and I was starving.
Pulled out my iPhone, Yelped 'sushi'.
Decided to give the much-raved about Sushi on Shea a shot.
I was seated at the sushi bar--one of the largest I've dined at in Scottsdale.
Directly behind the sushi bar is a gigantic fish tank, serving as a reminder of the living creatures you are about to consume.
It does add a nice aesthetic touch.
At this point in the night there were only a few people dining so I had my own personal sushi chef.
I started out with hot green tea and some edamame.
It was cooked perfectly (I always hate it when it's slightly over- or underdone.
)    After much contemplation and internal debate (the sushi menu is quite large, including many nigiri- and sashimi-style options), I chose the Houston roll, vegetarian roll and unagi nigiri.
The Houston:  fresh tuna, cucumber, and jalapeno.
The tuna was indeed incredibly fresh and the portion generous.
Very tasty.
The vegetarian:  cabbage, carrot, sprouts, cucumber and asparagus.
It was HUGE!
I loved how I felt like I was getting a full serving of veggies from this one dish.
The Unagi was incredibly tender, although the cut of the eel could have been larger.
Props for minimizing the amount of rice it sat upon, and for using the eel sauce in moderation.
I loooove ginger, and when I asked for a LOT, the sushi chef presented me with a plate of generously cut ginger--clearly premium ginger, if there exists such a thing.
Bonus points for removing the paper chopstick wrapper from the vicinity and for refilling my tea before I had to ask for more.
A few bucks more per roll, but for fish this fresh I'm willing to spend the extra dough.
Don't be turned off by this--there are several cheaper rolls (including the above mentioned vegetarian roll), and I hear that happy hour is fantastic.
I've FINALLY found my go-to sushi restaurant in Scottsdale.
And because of this, I think I'll be able to call Scottsdale home.
Thank you Sushi on Shea.

I have only been here once, for a friend's birthday.
It was pretty good, I had a shrimp tempura roll.
Not the very best I've ever had, the atmosphere was pretty lively.
It was a good time, I would go back.

Jesus.
Yeah....I get it.
Easter was last week.
But this was place rose to the occasion.
I was in the mood for Sushi, so I bamboozled a fellow Yelper into joining me for dinner.
She suggested this place.
When you walk in, you are reminded of some middle class Chinese restaurant in Salt Lake City.
Oh wait....that's just me.
Probably because it reminds me of Ocean City in Holladay....right outside the former Cottonwood Mall.
I'd go there on my lunch breaks when I'd work at ZCMI/Macy's....but I digress....
The tables are nicely put together with blue table clothes that could easily match someone's dress.
We ordered a sashimi combo, the houston roll, and a vegetarian roll.
Everything was fantastic.
The fish was fantastic.
Cold.
Tasty.
Cuts were perfect.
It's all served on top of a bowl of sushi rice which is VERY flavorful.
It's mixed with little bits of what seems like carmelized onions.
A very complex, but subtle flavor that is sure to give your tastebuds a hardon.
The Houston roll was quite large, had a hint of jalapeno.
Could've used some more heat, but packed enough flavor, so it didn't really matter.
The vegetarian roll was simply amazing!
It was like eating your daily serving of vegetables right there and then.
Even though I was full at the end of the meal, I was trying to convince my partner in crime that we needed to order one more of these.
Didn't happen.
Probably for the better.
I am so glad we came here.
I am #defo coming back.
4-sho.

This place is amazing.
I adore the Chicken Katsu but everything on the menu is good!
The owner is lovely and they work really hard and do a great job!

As soon as you walk in, you will be warmly greeted and welcomed, the tables are perfectly put together.
Directly behind the sushi bar is a huge fish tank, which accents the ambience of this restaurant.
I had the sashimi, which was again, perfectly made.
Will be back for more!

This has to be one of my favorite spots.
I love the croqutte potato, and the house salad has a delicious homemade dressing that is off the charts.
I hit this place up about once a month and am never disappointed.

Prior to going to 'Sushi On Shea' I had only been to Ra.
I knew nothing about sushi, but did have at least a sample of what is out there as I know Ra is everywhere.
Sushi On Shea offers individuals the exclusivity of having some phenomenal sushi with someone without running into people you may not want to see.
It is tucked away in the corner on the second floor but is very spacious and with extremely gracious service.
Very nice fish tank to gaze upon even if you decide to get your food to go.
More of a formal sitting than a casual sushi bar such as Ra.
Can be intimate with seating available.
The wait is a bit longer than some places but not bad!

really good sushi and an nice quiet place to eat dinner.

Best sushi I've ever had, staff very friendly  I was in on vacation from palm springs and will come back again.

Best sushi the the north valley....period!

I loved the service here!
I took a friend to this place to try out Shabu Shabu (the only restaurant in arizona to serve this style food) for the first time and the server went through great lengths to give us the best experience.
Towards the end of the meal the server actually made some mixed eggs which did not come from the meal but as some sort of appreciation for coming into their restaurant and i thought that was amazing!
She strictly said that "this is special and we do not offer it" and for her to do that  is a plus in my book.
The Shabu shabu was great and I definitely recommend it!

Pretty good for sushi in Phoenix!
The service was friendly, and they have a good happy hour.
Very good for the price too.
Would definitely return!

I had sukiyaki here not too long ago.
I loved it.
It's a bit pricey, but it's very good, and you can easily share it with a friend.
The sukiyaki is brought out to your table and cooked right in front of you.
Smells wonderful, tastes better.
We also had mochi and green tea ice cream.
Both were excellent.
Our waitress was awesome.
She was friendly, timely and made the whole experience that much better.
The atmosphere was relaxed and calm and I would definitely recommend this place.

The sushi was very good.
It was fresh and well presented.
We also ordered the tuna tartare..
The dish looked great and I asked the woman (who appeared to be the owner,server etc.
)  if they had any rice crackers.
She mentioned that they use to serve them but they typically went to  waste.
Well, three minutes later she appears with a plate of wonderful crackers.
Terrific customer focus.

great service and the Vegas Roll was Yummy!

The place is good- the sushi is fresh and they have pretty awesome fish tanks (love me some puffers) in there.
My only complaint is that the miso soup is a whopping $4!
Is it just me?
Or is that too expensive?
Most sushi places that I frequent have it for about half the price... or it is included in the meal.
Other than that- I'm a fan :)

Probably some of the most awful/over priced sushi I've ever eaten!!
I am a crazy sushi lover!!
I just moved to Arizona from LA, ca and I've been checking out different sushi joints....trying to find the best one in AZ.
This place was crazy over priced for the crap food they gave us!
My husband got salmon and I got a few rolls.
The food quality was AWFUL!
The service sucked!
I don't mind paying $100 for a few sushi rolls, soup, and some salmon, but it better be good!
Sadly it was not, the rolls were small and very thin...the rice was hard!
This was the first time in my whole 22 years of eating sushi that I've ever experienced hard rice on a sushi roll!!
On a better note, the salmon and soup was pretty good!
I will NEVER return to this place......

Some how my review got deleted!!

Service was great and I spent the entire lunch staring at their awesome exotic fish tank!
Oooh sharks!
I really enjoyed the salad and soup that came with the lunch menu, both were very refreshing.
Unfortunately, my sushi was not.
It felt a bit gummy in texture which made me think it was not all that fresh.
It tasted fine and I felt fine afterwards, so I guess it was ok.
Still, I could not get over the texture!

Sushi On Shea...... OH MY.
I believe you have put yourself in, if nt above the entire class of Sushi in the desert.
Sushi and fresh seafood seem to have some challenges when you're hundreds of miles from the water.
But Sushi on Shea sees that as NO EXCUSE.
If you read on their website they make some great statements on how sushi should be etc...
They MEET and EXCEED all expectations I had.
So let's get to the review.
I've been to many Sushi places in the Scottsdale/PHX area but never had any with ingredients THIS fresh.
Even eating Sushi in the NW of the country in Seattle and Portland few have had as fresh an ingredients and I'm a very tough critic.
I actually went today for the first time(on my birthday) with my roommate for lunch.
What a treat.
We got the deep fried scallop roll, sweet potato roll, vegetable roll, eel&cucumber roll and california roll.
We also got shrimp and vegetable tempura.
As well as a small bowl of Miso.
HIGHLIGHTS Miso-AMAZING and flavorful.
California Roll-SO FRESH.
My roommate said it was the best California roll she ever had.
Tempura-Vegetables were FRESH.
Shrimp was as succulent and juicy as a shrimp could be.
Sweet Potato Roll- Very unique never heard of or had one, very good.
Vegetable Roll-The prettiest looking vegetable roll filled with ingredients.
And again FRESH(catching a theme here?
) LOL  Anyway, bottomline is that if you are new in town, been scarred by horrible "desert sushi", are a first timer when it comes to sushi or just need a new place to try of QUALITY.
Go, you won't be disappointed.
Og yes, and as other reviewers have said the surroundings in the restaurant are very nice, big fish tanks, chill music, AMAZING service.
Keep Yelipin Peoples!

Hands down the best sushi in the valley!
My husband and I eat here all the time and neither one of us have ever walked out disappointed.
The food is delicious!
I usually get sushi, but sometimes my husband will order something different and it's always top notch.
I've never had something that wasn't top quality.
Sadako cares about the food that she serves you and wants to make sure it's right.
The staff is great.
We've been sitting at the sushi bar a lot lately and Moses will make you whatever you would like - even if it's specifically on their menu!
Give Sushi on Shea a try - much better than other places in the valley!

This week, we decided to venture up to Scottsdale for our sushi fix, and despite a name that would seem to belong at a large outdoor corporate shopping center, Sushi on Shea had a promising menu.
We walked in early in the evening, and the place was virtually empty.
Sitting at the bar, we started with the miso soup with clams.
This was actually superior to the same dish at Yasu; the soup was less briny, and the clams were a little more plump and flavorful.
I knew at that point that this would probably be a good meal.
The first items we ate were the live jumbo clam and the kai snapper sushi from the specials menu.
Let me tell you - the clam was one of the freshest, most delectable seafood items I've ever eaten.
The owner recommended we eat it straight, without soy sauce - its flavor is so delicate and so perfect that you don't need to soil it with something else.
The kai snapper was also tasty; it was seared, with a bit of skin to give it a strong, unique flavor that you don't normally get from nigiri.
After the clam, we were served a half dozen oysters, which were topped with ponzu sauce (made in-house).
The oysters were good, but I felt like the sauce was a bit too overpowering.
I'd have cut the sauce in half.
Usually when I eat oysters, I only lightly drizzle them with mignonette, because I love the flavor of those scrumptious little bivalves.
Next, we had the yellowtail collar off the specials menu (I forgot what it's called, but the owner explained that it is prepared with garlic and ginger, and that her restaurant is the only place you can get it prepared that way).
It was absolutely delicious.
I'm not normally a fan of cooked fish, but this was probably the best cooked fish I have ever tasted.
It was fall-off-the-bone tender, rich in flavor, and the Japanese eggplant soaking in the soup was just delicious (and I don't even like eggplant).
While showing off her fresh uni (not as fresh as the just-killed-it-and-scooped-it-out uni I've had in California and Portland, but still fresh), she suggested trying it with squid and quail egg.
So we did, and it was delicious.
(As a side note, she did say that she gets live sea urchin from time to time; she had been expecting it to arrive with the live clam, but it didn't.
If you time it right, you might be able to get live sea urchin here.
)  After the uni, squid, and quail egg sushi, we had our main sushi and sashimi platter.
We went with king salmon sushi, aji sushi, and blue fin toro sashimi (all from the specials menu).
Yes, king salmon tastes different, and better, than your run-of-the-mill salmon.
And blue fin toro tastes different, and stronger, than normal tuna.
At this point, we decided we were not quite finished.
We ordered the tuna carpaccio and the yellowtail citrus roll (which was on the specials menu).
The carpaccio was my friend's favorite item; it is tuna topped with creamy horseradish mayo and wasabi and black tobaiko.
I'm not sure exactly what was in the yellowtail citrus roll, but it had yellowtail on the outside, and something cooked and flavored with a chipotle seasoning on the inside.
It was spicy with a hint of citrus.
My verdict on this place is that it is an extremely good sushi bar, with plenty of interesting cuts of fish that you don't see at the generic places outside of Scottsdale.
It is also not trendy sushi, and everything is nice and fresh.
Sushi On Shea has to be considered one of the best sushi bars in Phoenix; I'm not sure if I enjoyed the overall dining experience better than the excellent meal we had at Yasu, but this seems to be better place to get traditional sushi and less common fish.
A final note: the owner said they do omakase meals.
I didn't inquire about the price, but I will most definitely be back eventually, just to see how they do with that.

We magically landed at this sushi place about two weeks ago, so happy we did!!
We loved the location ( Corner of Shea Blvd and Scottsdale) and the amazing Blue lighted fish tanks!!
Great entertainment while eating!!
We came in close to closing time and they still treated us like royalty!!
Much appreciated!!
We then decided for the Eel Roll as well as their Cali roll, Teriyaki Bento Box and some Chicken Yakisoba noodles!!
It was all delicious, especially the eel roll and chicken yakisoba!!!
Yum :)  We honestly had an amazing time and satisfying conquer from this place.
The reason for the four stars is their early closing time!!
Oh well :)

Location was convenient and our server was very nice.
The food was just nothing to write home about.
We could've gone to Ra for the same food at a cheaper price...
The Spicy Tuna was very good.
We decided to try something new and go with the Houston roll which was good for the first few bites and then just got...weird.
Overall, the food was OK but overpriced for the quality.

Given that the last time I was here was five years ago - and it was packed with a line out the door - I assumed (which you should never do) that it would still be the same great place.
Unfortunately, we were one of three couples in the whole restaurant.
Not letting that derail our evening, we ordered drinks and our go-to sushi favorites, which, also unfortunately, came out to be half the portion size we normally see at our preferred sushi spots and twice the price.
While the sushi was good, the lack of atmosphere, cost per sushi ratio and the mind-numbing smooth jazz they were playing made it the fastest dinner we ever had, and now a place we won't ever return.
Sad to say given what it was in the past!

Being a vegetarian makes choices limited at times!
Japanese lady that waited on me was accommodating with my special requests!
Had Vegetable Tempura, a bowl of rice and my special request maki sushi.
Was as good as my Japanese grandmother made when I was a kid in Hawaii.

Sushi on Shea was a well decorated sushi restaurant.
The staff is friendly but that might of been because it was so empty.
I went on a Wensday night around 7 and it was completly empty.
I ordered a few of there specialty rolls such as the Lobster roll and the Eel and Avocado roll.
They were both good but nothing really that amazing to make me go back.
They do offer other selections other than sushi.

Not a big sushi fan but my wife is.
We went here and we ordered 2 sushi rolls and a coke and it was $35.00 bucks which I don't mind if it had been good.
But the scallop roll was undercooked and tasted bad.
Will not go back, should have known better since when I walked in there was only 4 other people.

I was super disappointed with Sushi on Shea.
My boyfriend and I split three rolls and he had a beer.
I ordered a cocktail (the purple haze I think) and it was NOT good.
I asked for a glass of wine instead... we got charged for both of the drinks.
Total came to $84... that seemed crazy?!
The lady that was working was super friendly and funny... that's the only reason I would give this place two stars and not one.

Descent service, quiet location, clean and friendly.
There was so many different menus to choose from, which made it confusing.
Even with the number of menus, there selection is limited and lacking creativity.
It's good spot to go for quick lunch break or simple dinner with the kids.

Went to Sushi on Shea for the first time last night (New Years Eve).
It was dead.
We just ordered basic sushi and had two cocktails each (4 total).
Bill was $130.
The sushi was ok, the service was ok.
There is far better sushi in the area.
Won't be going back.

Food is excellent, service great, family owned and been in business for over 30 years.
Exceptionally clean restaurant.
We have had birthday dinners there from 8-26 people over the years and we know owner Sadako Yamada.
Two beautiful 400 gallon fish tanks and candle light atmosphere

The best fresh fish in the area.
Delectable sashimi and amazing service.
The fish tank is a fun touch too!
