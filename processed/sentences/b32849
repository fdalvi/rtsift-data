I called this place yesterday to have flowers delivered to my daughter at school.
They are very helpful and reasonably priced.
Thanks Thompson Flower shop!

I just went into the flower shop during normal business hours and was told that there's nobody able to work there so I cannot get a flower they asked why I was there.
I told him I was there to get flowers and they said we're sorry you can't get any flowers here I said but isn't this a flower shop and they said yes but unfortunately we don't have anybody that is working.

I have never written a review.
Outstanding service!
I called from out of state to request a birthday bouquet to be delivered today.
The flowers were:  to quote the recipient : "FRAGRANT", "DELICIOUS",  "GORGEOUS" "1 of the BEST bouqets I have ever seen" "the vase is completely full and LUSH" I liked the idea of supporting a family owned business and greatly appreciate the service.
Thanks Thompson Flower Shop!

A small floral shop with excellent customer service.
Erika was great to work with and she was very friendly and understanding.
She worked with my budget and her creations were amazing!
I can't say enough good things about this place.
I highly recommend this shop.
