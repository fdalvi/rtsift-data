Free wifi.
It was pretty clean, even the restroom.
They use the card system here.
It was $1.99 for the double load washers and $0.30 for the dryers.
I wish the dryers were free like some other places though.
Come early when it's empty!

You use the card here, and it is free.....BUT....the cheapest washer is $1.99 and it is for a very small load.
The next size is up is the size of washer that most people would have at home..that was $3.99.
Dryers are 30 cents for 8 minutes.
I payed almost $20 to the equivalent to 6 loads of laundry in a residential washer...OUCH!!!!
Place was super clean and the staff was very helpful.
You can also use your visa/mastercard here.

The only one in Avondale I'll go to!
Clean.
Friendly, helpful staff, tvs, vending machines

Very clean.
Great Customer Service!
Great,  clean restrooms!
It gets busy, but that's expected for a clean, large place.
You pay for convenience and cleanliness!

The laundry service is pricey @1.00 a pound, but they did an excellent job!
Laundry smelled wonderful, was wrinkle free, folded neatly, hung neatly, and done promptly!
If I could afford it, I'd use it regularly!
