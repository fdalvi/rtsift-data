Do not come here!
I came here just to get a basic cut and they guy totally botched my hair!

HORRIBLE experience here.
My hair cut look so bad after I left the kids hanging around the front of the store made fun of me!
But, I guess it's my fault I usually go to another place, but I needed something convenient......  O wait, it's not my fault, THEY SHOULD LEARN HOW TO CUT HAIR!

Waited 40 min for a hair cut and was a  big mistake.
