Didn't like the first therapist I had.
Could barely understand her.
There is always a long wait.
The waiting area is not big enough and people wind up standing around.
They double book therapists so be prepared to share.
The only reason they get two stars is because they have a pool and that's a big plus if your doctor prescribes it.
But then again, the pool was a little stinky and dirty.

I have a problem with my hip.
My therapist Lauren is great.
She has provided me with exercises that are improving my hip.
She has also given me ideas to take back to the gym so that I can work there on my improvement.
As far as double booking,  I do not have a problem with her working with me and another patient.
She gives me my exercises then goes to the other person for thier exercises or situation (massage, etc).
I went to another PT place after breaking my leg (4 yrs ago) and I worked with the therapist only 3 times over 6 weeks.
Then they had an uncertified person giving me my exercises.
My therapist always has time for working on the muscle damage-massage.
She is encouraging and helpful.
Within 4 visits I have seen definate improvement.
I should only need a few more.
I have never had to wait more then 3 or 4 minutes tops.
I went ot the Chandler facility.
I did have to wait a week to get an appointment.

Tried physical therapy for my runners knee.
Fabian was knowledgeable and made therapy fun.
I am back to my active self thanks to his care.
The facility is clean,  staff is friendly.....
I would recommend 360 Physical Therapy!
