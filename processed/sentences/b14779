This is the local Circle K in my neighborhood.
It is on the way for the one stop shop.
They have good coffee, Power Ball, RedBox, and even Propane for the BBQ.
I usually get gas at Costoc, so Circle K is a good backup.
It is clean inside, easy to maneuver on the outside, and the employees are polite and friendly.

Not bad as convenience stores go, but I'm spoiled on the QT stores.
So yeah...  Officially it s a, "Meh.
I've experienced better.
