Rose is the only person i'll let touch my lashes She never disappoints and really takes her time to meticulously glue every lash.
The lady I used to go to would only take about 45min - 1 hour to give me a fill, but Rose takes about 2.5 hrs for her fills.
I know its worth the extra time because the lashes really do stay on longer.
No complaints here!

Best lash woman in Las Vegas hands down!
i got so many compliments after my first session that i looked different in a good way..they were asking if i got a facial or Botox?.
hehe Rose is my secret weapon to looking glamourous and youthful.
I can't say enough what a different it makes to have beautiful lashes that look natural.
Im hooked !!
i also want to say that she is very professional..cooperative if you need to change your schedule and is al in all a pleasure to see every time.
Thanks  Ann Marie
