First time here and This place spells my name wrong, c'mon it has 5 letters total (I actually don't care about this but worth pointing out)  Then I wait 30 min for a preliminary vision check (routing tests) then get sent back to the waiting room to wait for the doctor and then another 40 min passes.
this place has 4 receptionists and 1 doctor and is horribly inefficient.

I wish I had more stars to give.
Staff is extremely helpful and friendly.
Examination was thurough and well explained.
Even after moving to Mesa my family and I still make the drive to have our eye work here.
