Ridiculously cute clothes, a good sale, a friendly cashier, and some truly outlet-priced items.
I had to make myself STOP and get out of there before I got too many teeny outfits.
It would've been sooooo easy to go hog-wild here.
And this is what I've become -- hog wild at a kids' clothing store?
(shakes head and mutters)

Nice big store with lots of clothes for babies and tots.
I thought all of the stores in this mall were outlet stores, but the prices did not strike me as particularly low.
I guess I'm not really comparing apples to apples though; I haven't shopped at a regular-priced Carter's store yet.
I have purchased Carter's clothes everywhere from Kohl's to Costco to Ross, and I would expect to see lower prices at Costco and Ross in particular, but I guess I would've expected an outlet store to have the same or lower prices.
They do have regular sales, and you can use coupons on top, so I guess that's where you'd really start seeing some savings.
