We love these guys!
We broke down in Phoenix at 6:30pm on a Tuesday (on our way back home to southern California at the end of a long tour).
Matt answered the phone half an hour after their posted hours (who does that?
) and told me they could take a look at our car first thing in the morning, no problem.
The reason the car wasn't starting was something that didn't cost any money to fix , but took them 45 minutes to find (they had to re-plug a fuel line) ... no charge.
Then they found a radiator hose that was brittle with age and had just broken in a weird, out-of-the-way place, that would have caused us a ton of grief half an hour down the road, and fixed that for $85 including parts and labor.
Matt even drove across town to get the part so we didn't have to wait 3 hours for delivery.
We got out of there for $85 total; anywhere else would have charged us a minimum $100 just to look at it and then added on to the bill from there.
John and Matt are good guys who exude camaraderie, competence, and good cheer.
And they totally took care of us in a situation that a lot of other people would have taken advantage of.
We can't recommend them highly enough.
Thank you John and Matt!

Fantastic!
We took our car to a different mechanic with a blown alternator, 3 alternators later he was still replacing alternators, took it to camelback auto and they fixed it the first time and for a better price,  fantastic service!

What a great shop.
Brought my 88 Jeep Grand Wagoneer with a blown engine in  diagnosed as such, Re built to to my specifications.
Went through ever thing came in on budget and on time.....
This is my new shop.
I highly recommend this shop.

Great mechanics!!!
Always honest and the guy who runs the place "Johnny boy" as I like to call him, is always friendly and has great pricing with quality work.
