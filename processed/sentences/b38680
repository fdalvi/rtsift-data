I needed three pairs of dress slacks hemmed in two hours.
I was in and out in less than 10 minutes for sizing.
Sure enough, two hours later they were ready.
And they did a great job!
(Be aware that Yelp's map of their location is inaccurate!
They are on Broadway and Priest!

Been coming here for several years.
Great work, done quickly, at good prices.
This new location is even closer to us and more convenient.

I get all my alterations and dry cleaning done here and they always turn out great and are always on time.
They are very friendly here and I highly recommend bringing your items here :)
