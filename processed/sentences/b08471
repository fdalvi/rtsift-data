I couldn't get a read on this place from online sources.
Upon driving over there, my friend and I realized it was a pool hall and bar with finger food.
It looked like a fine blue collar place for pool / beer after work.
It didn't serve meals and was definitely not a place for white collar guys like us.
I recommend going there only if you know someone who already frequents the place.

Still open under a new name, can't remember what it is.
Haven't been there in 30 years.
Used to be a place for Indians to drink until they fell down.
Lots of 400 pound Indian women looking for a man.
Very nasty.
Had one beer there and saw a guy get knifed.
Never went back.
The culture here is so diverse, the liberals must love it.
I'm sure the place with a new name is still the same.

BRING BACK PECOS!!
BRING BACK PECOS!!
I learned a lot about Mexican Culture when it was Pecos Lounge.
They clientele would buy you beers/tomato juice because they didn't know if you were INS or what.
But they were real friendly to Gringos.
Got some Salsa dancing lessons on Saturday nights and played some sharks in pool.
Also got a LOT of free tequila shots.
I see that the 'new and improved' Juggz is already closed.
I haven't seen the doors open nor any bikes/cars in the lot in over a month.
Maybe they should make this a drive-thru liquor store.
I bet it would get a lot of business from the Apts across the street.
