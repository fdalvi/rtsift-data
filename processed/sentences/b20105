Being a fair distance off the beaten track for tourists and far enough away from the main student areas of town, Clars Bar attracts a large contingency of local residents rather than tourists or students.
Me and my flatmates came here after signing our lease for our flat at DJ Alexander just down the road.
The place had quite a nice appearance about it with lots of wood wherever you looked and seemed quite cosy and the clientelle seemed really friendly as did the staff.
There were lots of drinks on tap including several real ales.
It would be good to come here to watch a football or rugby match as I could imagine the atmosphere would get pretty intense in here.
If I was more local to here I would definitely come more often.

Superb local bar.
It really is a true local.
Don't be intimidated by this as they all seem pretty friendly and you are in the affluent new town / stockbridge area.
The decor is very traditional and this is one of it's main attractions.
Lots of wood, leather and brass.
I can imagine nothing much has changed for decades.
I don't go there as often as I would like but look forward to popping in when I'm in the area.
It is a good place to watch sport and they will even change the channel if there is something more interesting on the other side.
There are also 2 small rooms at the back which are ideal if going in with a group of frields.
