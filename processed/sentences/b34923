Lauren is patient and knowledgable.
She is a fantastic agent and helped me find the perfect home in a great location.
Even with my small budget she found me a great place.

As a established and busy Home/Commercial Inspector, I have been blessed to stay booked with new and repeat clients and meeting many Realtors.
Recently I had a repeat client request an inspection on a occupied home, giving me the Realtors name and contact info.
Making contact with the clients Realtor I never had a return or courtesy call.
The only reason the inspection was performed in a timely manner was due to the listing agent going far beyond the norm.
That agent is Lauren Paris although I did not meet her face to face her persistence's was what made the inspection possible.
I salute her professionalism, dedication and work ethic.
She is a minority in that respect she represented her client to the fullest and actually did more for all interested then the buyers agents.
She is a credit to her profession and no doubt an asset to her Broker.
I would recommend Lauren Paris to all buyers and sellers from the few times I spoke to her and the professional manner in which she preforms.

I have worked with many realtors in the past and Lauren is by far one of the best.
She is extremely knowledgeable and highly customer service oriented.
Lauren promptly returned all phone calls, emails and texts.
She responded to questions in a very timely fashion, provided advice when needed and communicated clearly and concisely.
Lauren is professional, and made the process very easy.
I will definitely be working with her in the future.
