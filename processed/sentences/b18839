Very homey Koran place with decent food.
I like the side dishes very much.
They have a lot of food here that you'd usually see  if visiting your Korean friend's mom's house.

Only place I know in AZ that serves Kimchi Fried Rice and Ramyun with the noodle cake things.
That alone is enough reason to eat here.
However, that doesn't mean any of their other dishes are lacking.
The GF and I some sort of clam/seafood clear broth soup and it was light, but still good.
Only thing I can think of avoiding is the lunch bowls.
A buddy of mine ordered the Chicken one and we weren't sure if the chicken was rubbery because it was super processed or not cooked all the way through.
