Danielle's professionalism and quality of the alteration I received deserve 5 stars however the procedures used to estimate and charge the client are in need of improvement.

Always on time and great job with cleaning and alterations.
I am part of their Platinum service could not be happier.

Well worth the drive for the service !!

Service is exceptional, friendly staff.
Clothes are always ready when told !!!
Tami and Danielle are what customer should be like.

I never write bad reviews, but I was so upset after leaving this place.
I called in before I came in to check on pricing on alterations and the girl told me $6-7 over the phone and so I was reluctant to bring my pants in right away.
When I came to pick them up, they told me it was double that for each pair.
It would have been one thing to understand that the customer was obviously misinformed bc I was surprised on the price and even explained to them what I was told by the other employee, but they had poor customer service by automatically telling me the manager would still make me pay before even trying anything.
And that I wouldn't be able to find alterations for $6-7 anywhere, but it's not like I arbitrary picked $6-7 out of no where to get a cheap hem; this is what I was informed.
Then they call the employee who misinformed me to make sure, even though I already got the impression they weren't gonna do anything about it.
And the employee says she doesn't remember, so of course it's her word against mine, therefore they told me they can "take the hem out" or "give me a 10% discount".
How generous of them....

Horrible!
Many times my clothes have returned smelling like cigarette smoke.
Very pricey too.
I will never use their service again.
