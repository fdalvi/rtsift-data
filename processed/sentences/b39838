I tried this place because it is close to me, what a mistake.
Food is bland and gross as well as over priced.
Save your money and go to Lil' Cesars.

The managers and customer service are the worst.
BUT the pizza is delicious!!!
I love it and have been coming for years.
I wish they would stop raising their prices though.
A large used to be $5 now they are $9.
