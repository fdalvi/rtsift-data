Service was impeccable - staff is well-versed, has FUN and was one of my fave boutiques in Vegas.
Selection was well merchandised - from RTW, to accessories, to more couture offerings.
Shop is a cozy gem - clever use of its compact space.
Worth visiting for the eye candy alone!

The sales girls were very stuck up and the selection was not great.
I did buy a bag.
I wish DVF would bring out new colors in the Stephanie bag or something, they are still selling the metallic black & silver & gold for $875.00 same price it was 3 yrs ago in the same colors.
I do realize they released other colors in-between but the store only had the black n silver n gold in stock.
I will never understand judgmental sales associates, u work at a clothing store please don't judge me I have a good job.
This store was a little disappointing.
