I have been going to the Athleta store in Portland and I was happy to see the one in Kierland open last year.
I love their yoga pants more than any of their other products.
So far, I have 4 pairs, 2 long and 2 capris, the other bonus is that they are not see thru, I checked, don't asked me how.
The only downside is that they are never on sale like other store (hint, hint, across the street).
I am glad I can at least use my rewards points to make them more affordable.

I LOVE their merchandise and it's great to have something other than lulu (are they even still around??
) but customer service is absolutely horrible.
Whoever does the hiring needs to reevaluate their hiring procedure cause right now it's just not working.
Save the stress and the great chance of being verbally abused by their employees (especially the woman with short blond hair) and order online.
