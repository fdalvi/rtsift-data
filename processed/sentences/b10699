I really like rockport shoes.
THey are so comfy.
However, it can be hard for the husby to find the shoes that he needs here.
His feet are kinda flat, wide and need to have just the right amount of arch in 'em for them to be comfy.
I came in here with the husby so he could take a look at the different shoes that they had available.
He found a few and tried them on.
I have no idea what he was up to.
I was whisked away into my own lil world.
I found that they had some boots that I was really interested in.
Not only were they comfy but although they appeared narrow, they were quite the opposite on the inside.
YAY!
I had to take advantage.
I told the clerk there that I wasn't going to be able to fit these into my luggage.
So, what did they do??
THe associate had them shipped to me.
When I got home from my Vegas trip, they were already delivered and waiting for me.
That was so awesome.
THANKS.

Decent selection.
Pricing is high.
Most of the shoes here I can find through other sources for cheaper prices.
When I was here, they were having a deal.
Save $50 on two pairs and save $100 on three pairs.
I really struggled trying to find a third pair worth buying (even knowing that it was effectively $50 off).
The sales folks were friendly enough, a bit pushy.
Much as I hate "showrooming" this is the kind of place where it makes sense.
Come try on a bunch of shoes, make notes of the models and sizes, and then buy them elsewhere.
