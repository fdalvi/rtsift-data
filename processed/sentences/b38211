Friendly lady rang us up for breakfast on the Saturday before St. Patrick's Day.
I ordered their cold tuna sandwich and regular coffee.
It was quick, considering that almost all our band friends were there buying breakfast before a street parade.
Food was okay, coffee was good.
Can't really complain.
However, having a food court inside a four star hotel in Las Vegas was kind of out of place for me.
But I guess that would be my review on the hotel and not this place.

Located inside the Tropicana hotel in Vegas, this is a great place to grab a quick bite.
Among many other items, they serve Pizza by the Slice....which is the perfect snack after a night of partying.
I tried:  Sausage & Pepperoni Pizza Slice http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/south-beach-food-court-las-vegas?select=ncLdFjaB3a9htYUWuwSnBA#ncLdFjaB3a9htYUWuwSnBA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/south-beach-food-court-las-vegas?select=FqoARkYIpXtO-GaUmVlafw#FqoARkYIpXtO-GaUmVlafw  Pepperoni & Jalape√±o Pizza Slice http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/south-beach-food-court-las-vegas?select=zHNa_aOLRUtbBBT1pZNXmA#zHNa_aOLRUtbBBT1pZNXmA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/south-beach-food-court-las-vegas?select=E80jurgo3wNlDAd6r3lw2A#E80jurgo3wNlDAd6r3lw2A  Although I asked for my Pizza to be "well done", there was simply too much Cheese and Sauce for them to properly cook it that way.
They tried though.....but it was still very "doughy" and soft....blazing hot though, I had to give it a few min to cool off.
The flavor of the Pizza was OK....the Cheese overwhelmed it a bit.
The Pepperoni was quite small too.
Overall, it's a pretty average Slice of Pizza.
Return Factor - 60%

If you came in through the local's entrance it's past the player's club (take 3 lefts).
It's after the Starbucks.
Tropicana LV matched our statuses with our M Life cards.
Locals eat 25% off.
This place is our favorite local's casino.
I wanted to try 1.50 Locals pizza!
It's truly delicious, espically the dough.
My boyfriend had two slices of the Meat Lovers, and I had the White pizza.
Next time I should remember to flash my Gold card for 50%..
Still friendly staff and great food 5 star!
Regular prices..
Slices are $4 plus .75 for each topping.
An entire pizza (18") is $18 but I think it's beats eating at "Secret pizza" in the Cosmopolitan.
Tropicana has Free wifi you can use, " ILOVETROPLV ".

Came back to try their Calzones.
The basic calzone has Ricotta, basil & Mozzarella cheese, I added Spinach & Pepperoni.
It was super nice to enjoy something THIS good.
I always order them everytime we're here because they're mouthwatering.
I can wait the 15-20 minutes for a fresh well made calzone any day of the week.
Basic Calzone starts at $9 and it's a $1 for each filling.

I got my first case of food poisoning from this place.
First thing i ate in the day was a slice of veggie pizza and about two hours later i was extremely sick threw up all night, had severe diarrhea, high fever, shivering, and sweat profusely.
I'm just not sure how long those pizzas are sitting there without heat.

$8.50 slices of pizza....yay (lol) the free Hilton Honors breakfast that I received here included choice of 3 items, and one drink.
It was by far the worst breakfast I have received at a Doubletree anywhere in the world.
I am a Diamond member and spend a considerable amount of time at Hilton properties and was appalled at the level of service here.
Bagels were probably a frozen bagel, thawed and toasted.
They tasted dry and old.
Bread was fine, but only served with butter...no jam.
Yogurt Parfait was cheap yogurt with some strawberry goop and granola.
Not worth it.
Save your money and eat elsewhere...

While staying at Tropicana this past weekend, my friends & I decided to try this cafe after spending the day at the pool.
Service was decent & food was just ok.
However, after a few hours of having our meals 3 of us encountered horrible stomach aches and discomfort.
Gladly it didn't get any worse other than feeling grossed out until late night hours.
Will I recommend this place?
Certainly not but maybe someone will have better experience.
