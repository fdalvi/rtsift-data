Great bank!
Very nice employees, although a slightly weird location.
Its located in Scottsdale next to a pizza shop and a best buy in a strip mall.
I came in, they printed me checks really quickly, and called it a day.
Thanks everyone!

Convenient location, great hours, and a notary always on site.

I don't have an account with Chase but I've made some deposits here for other accounts and everyone that works here is always so helpful and kind.
I would consider opening a Chase account based on my experience at this location.
Plus they have free cookies =)

Chase credit cards no longer provides e-bills to other banks.
This makes online bill pay a lot of work.

Wow, I must tell that today I was so greatly helped at this branch.
Ms. Lisa Carpenter (branch manager) treated me so great.
Todd did as well, but most of my problems were needed to be handled by the manager.
Ms. Carpenter helped me right away with my account in an urgent situation.
She treated it like it was just as important to her as it was to me.
And for that I'm super greatful, in fact I even gave her a hug at the end of it all!
Great branch, great costumer service!
Miss Carpenter is runnin a great ship over there!
And knows what she's doing!
Awesome!
Thank you!
