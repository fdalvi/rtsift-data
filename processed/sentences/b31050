This new Chinese Restaurant just opened in Waterloo, so it's early days yet.
They speak Mandarin, not so much Cantonese or English, but are helpful.
Tried the Spicy Chicken with Rice special and it was quite tasty, not too spicy, but had a good kick.
Service was fast but I was the only person in the restaurant.
They're working on their cash register, so I had to pay by cash, they didn't have debit working yet.
The restaurant is located in the same plaza as Starbucks at King and University.

4 stars for the food.
3 stars for the staff being helpful.
We had the sweet and sour pork on rice.
Pork was cooked perfectly but the sauce could have been more sour in my opinion.
We also had the spicy and sour noodle soup which was delicious--my husband couldn't stop eating it!
I would eat here again.

The food was great and huge portions.
The service is great.
