Both of my daughters had their wisdom teeth removed by Dr Johnson.
Everyone from the office staff, nurses to the doctors are very professional, friendly and caring.
Office is very clean and modern.
Highly recommended.

This is the second time I have been here and both times I encountered doctors who really short with me and acted bothered that they had to explain things to me.
Today though, the woman who helps the doctor (I'm not really sure what her title is) was completely unprofessional.
She stood outside the door of the room I was in and complained to the doctor about me saying she didn't know why I came back to the office if I didn't like the prescription I was given last time.
Completely rude!
I guess she got her wish though because I certainly won't be going back there.

Being a previous happy customer at Nevada Oral and Facial Surgery aka  www.nofslv.com , we took our mother-in-law here for the All-On-4 dental implant procedure to replace all her teeth on top and bottom instead of the lesser alternative of dentures.
She is very, very pleased with the results and would recommend to anyone who needs full teeth replacement.
Beware of the lower priced dentists whom say they can do everything by themselves (Dr. Gallimore of 702-dentist.com did the 2nd half restoration part); you need a skilled surgeon to do the first half correctly and a skilled dentist to do the second half restoration.
I believe you get what you pay for and sometimes not even that if you have to get it redone later.
I'd also be wary of the cheaper mini-implants that others try to say are just as good, they are not in my opinion.
Nevada Oral & Facial Surgery has a lot of videos on YouTube  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLznnTPDEYA ) and an awesome staff.
