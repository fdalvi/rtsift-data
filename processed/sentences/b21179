There are so many stairs that lead up to this hostel you will definitely be out of breath!
Be sure if you are leaving for the day that you have what you need so you will not have to ascend the winding staircase!
I came here recommended by some friends.
This hostel is an independent hostel.
It really could use a huge facelift.
They have a huge central kitchen area and eating area, where alot of people party and drink beer at night.
There is also a tv room with tons of videos and a few other rooms to hang out in as well.
The rooms have lots of beds, and when I was there each bed had a name.
Mine was "lava.
" That made the stay a bit more fun and memorable!
Alot of people live in this hostel and work in town, or just bum around.
That is a bit weird, but I still had a pretty good time here.
Also, it stays light in Edinburgh really late into the night as well.
This hostel is in a great location as it is within walking distance of anything you may want to do in Edinburgh.
Thankfully the city is absolutely amazing, as I was not inside the hostel very much throughout my time there.
Even though they do have showers, I have stayed in hostels for what adds up to many months in many different countries, and I couldn't stop feeling that I was still dirty as this hostel makes one feel a bit grimy.
There was a condom machine in the hostel, and I just had to take a picture of it.
Written in black sharpie were the words, "Insert baby here for refund!
" I couldn't resist!!
I probably will not stay here next time, but if you are young, or really want to party, definitely a great place to be!
