We go to this PetSmart on a regular basis... probably a few times a month for all of our dog and fish necessities.
The employees are always very helpful - one of the employees even stopped to help me pick out a properly sized "Gentle Leader" and showed me how to put it on my dog.
I love that this PetSmart does adoptions with the local rescues on Saturdays.
Stop by if you want to see some cute dogs and cats :)

I got my bearded dragon, Loki (pictures at lokibd.blogspot.com) from this Petsmart.
She is happy, healthy, and growing like a weed, so I appreciate that they buy healthy animals and do seem to take good care of them.
However, a few times I have gone in there I have gotten bad advice from a few employees.
For example, feeding a baby dragon mealworms is generally a bad idea as they cannot process mealworms' hard shells.
One employee told me they feed their babies mealworms all the time, and tried to get me to buy some rather than crickets.
Do your own research before trusting a pet store employee; they care for dozens of animals every day, all with their unique care requirements, and don't have the time or resources to devote to making sure your particular breed of reptile/amphibian is getting the best care.
The store is bright and clean, and when they have dog adoptions they are in a large but fairly out-of-the-way spot from the rest of the store, so you aren't tripping over cages as you shop.
Their stock of reptile accessories is pretty good.

Nice place to get my American Bully treats, toys and apparel plus our vet is in the back and there is a groomers available if we need.
Descent deals typically and a rewards program of sorts.
Only thing missing is Taste of the Wild brand dog food...

I made an appointment for my dog and after the vet looked at him, I felt that I was being sold on treatment options.
I asked the vet a few questions and she acted like she wouldn't say what she thought without me agreeing to some type of plan.
Any vet would have told me what they thought without me agreeing to a treatment plan.
I got some meds for the doggie, but will look elsewhere for vet services...beware of salesmen acting like veterinarians.
