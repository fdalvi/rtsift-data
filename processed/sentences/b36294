The overall experience wasn't too bad.
I thought I would try this office because it was close to my house and quick for me to get to.
I called and got a same day appointment for 5:30pm and when I got there I had almost no wait as the place was pretty much empty.
The exam was fine but the problem came when I checked what they had billed my insurance.
The amount billed for the appointment was triple the amount I have ever been billed by any doctor, in addition to that there was a 200 dollar charge for having an appointment later than 5pm, which I was never informed of when I made the appointment.
The billing department assured me that if my insurance denied that charge they would not pass it on to me but I still do not support the idea of charging insurance crazy fees that in the end just drive up everyone's insurance costs.
I will not be back.

This practice will triple charge you and your insurance!!!
They are a rip off !
I I have never had to pay such high out of pocket expenses with my insurance as with this practice they totally take advantage.

I was fortunately only to have to deal with this company for a short time.
You are not allowed to contact your doctor without making an appointment, even if it's just them telling you everything is ok.
I'm not paying a copay for that.
Will not go through my pregnancy with this company at all.
They are all pretty on the outside, but honestly that's just a front for the lack of competence inside.
I did like the doctor, may even see her at her other office not associated with the Goodman & Partridge practice.
