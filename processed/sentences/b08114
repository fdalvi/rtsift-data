Pizza Hut pizza is all the same to me no matter where you get it.
But what makes this place stand out is their friendly customer service and willingness to accept perfectly valid promotions and coupons that other Pizza Huts arbitrarily refuse.
On two occasions this location pulled through where another one failed.
Keep up the good work!

This is my neighborhood Pizza Hut.
I've ordered from here since I moved to Mesa, 7 years ago.
I always preferred Pizza Hut over any other franchise pizza place.
The last time I ordered from there, they really dropped the ball, TWICE!
So, I ordered last Saturday, and I upgraded my meal from breadsticks to cheese sticks for an additional cost.
My meal also came with cinna-sticks.
When the food arrived, instead of cheese sticks, I got bread sticks, with a heavy sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar.
I called the location, and after being transferred 3 times, and 2 reps basically telling me I didn't exist as a customer because my order had been delivered, so I wasn't in the system, I got to speak with a manager.
The manager offered to have someone come back out and bring the cheese sticks.
So, I agreed.
15 minutes later, an unhappy looking delivery girl shows up, shoves a bag of bread in my face, and says, "here", and walks away.
No apology, no have a good day, nothing.
And do you know what she brought?
BREAD STICKS!
Not cheese sticks that I paid for, and waited extra for, but bland and unflavored carb sticks!
Sorry Pizza Hut, but I'm done with you.
This location failed so hard that day, that I will no longer be doing business with you.
This economy sucks, and people don't like to spend money on eating fast food.
You should treat your customers like you care, and actually appreciate their business.
I have many pizza choices in my area, and now my choices have been narrowed down because I won't be ordering from you guys anymore.
