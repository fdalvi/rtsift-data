So far I have tried both the Muay Thai and Jiu-Jitsu.
Both classes were fun and a great workout.
Despite it being a group class, the instructors do a good job of giving individual attention as needed.
Most of the classes have a decent size group attending with a nice mix of students.
As someone who was absolutely new to the sport, the classes didn't go so fast as to make me feel over-whelmed nor so slow as not to be a challenge and a workout.
Prices are about average from what I've seen for small gyms/martial art places.

If you're looking to get in shape, learn self defense, or even aspire to fight professionally..
THIS IS THE SPOT!
I've been here for about 4 years now.
Everyone is like a big family, friendly atmosphere, no egos..
