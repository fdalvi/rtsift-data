Quality:  They've done excellent on everything I've taken there.
For example, they take the time to unbutton all of my button-down shirts.
The long creases down my dress pants are almost always on the  pre-existing line that the pants manufacturer put there.
Service:  They are always pleasant and courteous; my daughter will even get out of the car just to say hello.
Also, English is their 2nd language, and sometimes I'm not sure if I'm understood.
Price:  It costs me $5.60/day to have one day's pants & a shirt done.
It seems high, so I'm conflicted between taking clothes there or doing them myself.

This is my new favorite cleaners!
They're fast, and they provide excellent quality.
I don't dry clean a lot of my clothes, I just dry clean when I have something to be mended, or something with a stain.
At other cleaners I often have to double check their work and send things back because they haven't fully removed the stain the first time.
I've never had that problem with Crystal Cleaners.
They're awesome!

This cleaners does it perfect each and every time I use them.
I have all of my work shirts and slacks done here and I love the results.
I get my shirts pressed with heavy starch and they're always how I like it.
Even if I have a loose button on a shirt they fix it immediately before it goes together pressed.
I've never had them not be on time!!!
I highly recommend this cleaners above all the others in Chandler!!

Two suits and two shirts for $24 overnight.
That's what I am talking about.
And great hours if you need to pick up after work.
They did a great job and I will go back for sure.
