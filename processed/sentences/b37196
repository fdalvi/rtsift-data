Clean, nicely decorated, calm nail salon.
We were greeted and taken immediately, without an appointment.
The technicians were nice and professional.
My mom had a gel mani and regular pedi, I had just a pedi.
They let me stay in the massage chair the whole duration of my moms services- some places have made me get out of the chair even though they didn't need it :( .
We're not frequent nail salon people but I think they did a good job!

Lovely place.
It was slow on Saturday morning.
But my nail tech was in such a hurry to finish my gel nails and they look like they were done in a rush ;(  they look like I painted them myself which defies the purpose of having them done by a professional!
I will try the nail salon across the street next time.

I love this place!
they did exactly what i had asked for and when my nail tech couldn't do the bow I wanted he didn't even try he had another lady do it to make sure it was perfect!
the only negative thing was that the soaking bowl water was cold, but if that's the only down side i'll take it!
