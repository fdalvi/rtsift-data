The intelligent folks at this establishment put turkey meat on a vegetarian Bobbie sandwich because they don't understand the meaning of the word "vegetarian".
They'll also refuse to make you a new sandwich and won't refund the sandwich that they made improperly.
Now THAT'S customer service.

Writing a review because one of the vegetarian reviewers gave them a one star.
this place is good.
if you are a vegetarian or vegan or whatever, please dont go here and spare us meat eaters the grief.
Capriottis is the bomb.

This place is amazing.
The staff is amazing and the food.
We have been to another Capriottis around town and had some rude service once but this one is great.
We usually get the Bobbi.
It's turkey, with stuffing, mayo and cranberry sauce.
Pretty much just perfect.
So if you haven't tried it please do!

This is gonna be short and sweet.
Good food but I hate when you advertise something you don't have.
I can understand if something is online not on your site but you actually don't offer it.
You can't fix everything.
But on your own windows?
If you don't offer delivery please don't have it all over your windows.

Always a great sandwich here.
from the Capristrami to the Bobbie you can never go wrong with a sub from Cariottis.
Soft bread and full of fillings there consistency among their chain is very admirable as far as chair restaurants go.
I'm lucky to have one right across the street from where I live.
Youll pay a bit more than a sandwich from Subways but it's worth it extra buck or two.

Took about 20 minutes to make my sandwich with only 3 people ahead of me.
Also there's no reason for them to wear gloves as they'll type in the register and take your order holding a pen with gloves on then turn around n make a sandwich.
Not going to this location anymore.
