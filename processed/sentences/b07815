LOVED it here!
If your a true pupusa lover you will get your fill here.
Place is a little dirty and in the summer it gets real hot, but the food is absolutely worth it.
Wish they had one in north Phoenix!

I have been going to the pupusa loca for years, and have tried just about all of the different pupusa resturant  in the valley.
This place is Authentic and although the ambiance and the area isn't five stars their food makes up for it!
Everytime I go I have to order pupusa con loroco (a flower)  frijol, fried yucca, a drink can Chan and some fied fishies (I can't remember what they are called)....I forgot the fried plantains :-) Yuuuuuuuuuuummmmy!!
I am not Salvadorian but my friends who are love going to this place.

LOVE THIS PLACE!!!
Yes it's in the hood, yes the waitress doesn't give a crap about you, yes it's hella hot in there and yes it's full of "beanerish" drunk men just giving you the creeps BUT THE PAPUSA'S ARE THE BOMB!!!
That is the only thing I have ever ordered there and will continue to go there!

This place is the best for popusas.
Sad to say the location on 43rd and Thomas has closed And is now a mariscos restaurant.
