So, I'm looking for a quick meal.
And I thought to myself whats inexpensive, but the quality is pretty good, so Popeye's came to mind.
I went to the closest Popeye's near UNLV.
I will never go there again.
To begin with, one of the staff persons was mopping the floor while food is being prepared, I am no health inspector but I think its a health hazard, it provided an unsafe environment for the worker who were all just wearing tennis shoes.
Second, the cashier asked me if I wanted spicy or mild chicken, i told her mild.
She said that I'd have to wait 15 minutes for the mild chicken, so I said fine just give me spicy.
I also ordered an apple pie, which she forgot to give me, until I asked her for it and said she didn't put on the original reciept.
Anyway, I am a fan of Popeye's but not this location.

This isn't great food--not even close.
But it's one of several options on the walk home after classes, and when I'm not in the mood to cook this seems to be where I end up most often.
I like fried chicken, and when I want fried chicken, this does the job.

1) Stale fries 2) Watery gravy 3) Ketchup packs were all nasty because i guess sauce spilled all over it  i've been to wayyyyy better popeyes!

Rude staff member= nasty food Food cold and not fresh NASTY NASTY NASTY
