Quick Work, local business, Mike the owner was honest and to the point and replaced our blower motor for AC lickety split for this upcoming HOT weekend-got us our vehicle back the same afternoon.

I have been going there for years.
If you need anything they will do it for you.
I had them rewire my 72 mustang from head light to tail light and they did a great job.
They are not quick but they are always extremely busy.

Cars.
Haven't owned many of them.
I've ridden subway cars for most of my life.
When a car did need some work there was always a man around (Dad!
My brother!
) to handle the fixin'.
Yes.
That's the sexist truth.
So after hearing a number that made me gasp from a Ford dealer I turned to a dude.
He recommended Spitfire Automotive.
Actually, who he recommended was "Mike Carlton on Indian and near you.
"  Can I tell you next to useless this bit of information is on Google?
(Still shaking my head on that one.
) Anyhoo, I finally found the owner.
With such a glowing referral (the dude had used him to fix his off road racing bikes many, many times) I figured, "Eh.
Ok.
Besides, what do I know?
" And it was conveniently close.
After speaking to Mike to confirm his hours of operation I dropped my car off.
His team was able to look at my car the next day of operation.
They confirmed the diagnosis the dealer made lickity split.
I was shocked, there's no way to emphasize the level here, but SHOCKED when Mike called with his estimate.
The difference was substantially less *and* my car was going to be ready the very next day.
Let me say that last part again: My car was going to be ready THE NEXT DAY.
I don't know the location of the magical unicorn tree where Mike grows Ford dealer parts.
But my car, Bear, is so very happy.
No need for a rental car, so I was happy too!
Spitfire Automotive is family owned and operated.
It was opened in 1958 by Mike's grandfather when Indian School was a two-way dirt road.
Currently the shop handles automobiles and motorbikes.
There are plans to move motorbike repair to a northern Scottsdale location (74th St & Butherus Dr.) where it will be called "Dirt Riders West".
Motorbikes can be purchased at Spitfire Automotive.
While there I got my first up close and personal look at something called an off-road Beta Motorcycle 300.
The next part will make men groan.
(Ok. Maybe some women too!
) I'm looking at the bike and I think.
"Hmm.
It's ...red.
" I don't know!
These are things that go thru my head.
That, and, you better gosh darn write a review for this place.
It's girl friendly.
Manly place, but girl friendly.
Oh!
And efficiently fast!
