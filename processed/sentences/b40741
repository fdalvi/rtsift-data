Omg!
Pulled Pork sub was AMAZING!!!!!
Fries were ok. A bit soggy and cold my time it arrived at my room.
However they were open at 3am so that's a big A+ in my book!!!

I work nearby so sometimes I pop in at The Spread to change up my menu options.
I almost always get the chicken fingers, which are a great price.
It's something like $6 or $7 for them and they're a decent size and very filling.
They make it for you right on the spot so it's always hot and fresh.
I also need to point out that their fries are freakin' amazing.
One time my friend ordered them and I couldn't stop having "just one more.
" They really taste like In N Out fries, but a little better seasoned.
Also, the staff is incredibly nice.
I was worried since I came in the morning-time to order a lunch food that they might get annoyed, but nobody even thought twice about it.
It's my favorite part of Downtown Grand.

This place did not disappoint.
The "Mob Club" sandwich was well worth the price of nearly ten bucks.
The price includes a choice of fries, fruit cup, etc.
The bacon was great.
Excellent turkey meat piled high, and the bread was also excellent.
I look forward to coming back again!

Ordered the hot dog special.
It took 25 minutes.
It came with fries and a soda.
The soda calibration was set to more carbonation than syrup, my bun fell apart, and the fries were bottom of the barrel with so many tiny pieces and shriveled.
Take some pride in your quality of food.
