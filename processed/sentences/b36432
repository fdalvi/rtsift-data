Close to South Point Casino in Las Vegas ...so you can gas up and head out without going out of your way.

Located near South Point Casino & Hotel.
I've had to stop in a few times to gas up.
Normally, I don't because their prices are higher than the competition.
Best thing about this gas station is their location.

The fuel reward network doesn't work at this store.
Store has been notified several times to correct the system.
They refuse to fix the problem.
Reported problem to the fuel rewards network, hoping they can correct this shady problem.
