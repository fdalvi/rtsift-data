This  place is soo good and cheap.
We love it.
My husband and I have been coming here for over 12 years.
You have to try the chicken wings they r sooo good!
I recommend this place,  yes the place might be a little dirty so just take it to go.
its good for a quick cheap lunch.

I loooooove this place!!
I've been going there since i was like maybe 12 years old and the food is always good.
The lady is always nice and the little coin machines are always cute games.
The chicken is always bomb!

Best chinese food in vegas, hands down.
Homemade love in there and guess what??
the staff is nice..even on the phone.
the prices are too absolutely die for!
i spent more in gas getting there than i did on the food.
love u guys

My friends and I were going for lunch and I asked to go somewhere cheap.
THIS PLACE IS CHEAP.
It's also really delicious!
The sign is a little run down, but the inside is clean and the food is great.
They give you big portions and all the food comes in a to-go box so if you don't finish, you can just leave.
If you're low on funds but want to eat a lot, I recommend a trip to MB China!

Five stars every day of the week.
This had been one of the best Chinese food places in North town for years.
I'm not sure why there is not a line or the door.
I recommend the beef chow mein.
It's five bucks for a small bucket of delicious.

You can not beat this place for the prices!!
Good food, dirt cheap, funny lady at the counter.
Love it here, I'm from Cali and this taste like the hole-in-the-walls back home.
Sweet and sour chicken House chow mein Pork fried rice Those delicious chicken wings  Thats my usual!
all for around $25
