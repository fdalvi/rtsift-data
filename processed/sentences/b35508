Whoever thought that I'd be able to find heaven in good ol', downtown Vegas?
Accessed through an elevator across from the pool area in the hotel, you will find a gleaming, golden lobby with a receptionist there to greet you and check you in.
After check-in, I was led to a desk where I was offered water or fruit juice, a pair of spa slippers, and a key to my locker.
Inside, I found a fluffy robe to change into.
The waiting room had a selection of fresh fruit to choose from, some dried fruit, as well as teas and cucumber water.
I put on my swimsuit and went exploring.
Steam room: Wow.
That room sure was...steamy.
The Sauna: Very sauna.
I ended up hanging out in their very large jacuzzi.
I think the sign said it accommodates something like 20+ people?
or maybe it was 10. iono.
it was humongous!
After my explorations, I was led to the desk, where I was greeted by Mauro, who was to be my masseuse:  Magical And Unbelievably good masseuse who Really, really, really works Out any kink or ache your muscles may have!
I swear, it was an unbelievable experience.
I read somewhere that sometimes masseuses manage to relax a person so much that the person...farts.
I didn't fart, but I did finally realize how someone could start farting during a massage.
So there you go.

Not a very large place but the services were great.
I had Linda M. who was by far the best massuer I have ever had.
We used a groupon so the prices were very reasonable.
