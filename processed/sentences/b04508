I'm hungover as I write this, so does that count for something?
:-p  Anyways, this is your regular liquor store.
It's really packed inside, and there's a good selection, but everything is so disorganized!
I see a shelf of vodkas together, but beyond that, it's all mixed up.
Cognac next to tequila?
Whiskey mixed up with rum?
I like what they have, but finding something in particular would be hard.
When I finally checked out, there wasn't really a counter to do so.
The clerk turned down his TV and pulled the pin pad out of the wall for me to use my debit card.
They should really remodel.
Great novelties, though.
30 proof whipped cream, anyone?

A great place to grab a quick drink.
The drive thru window is always moving and they provide great service.
I have no complaints here.

I come thru the drive thru a few times a week and must say..these are the nicest employees..Richard and Hassan have worked there FOREVER.. and are friendly,knowledgable and get people thru the drive thru quickly.
For the room they have to do business..they do a great job..Richard always makes a point to ask me how I'm doing and has a sincere smile on his face...
