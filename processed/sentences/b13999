The staff definitely has a problem understanding English.
I had a coupon for "free jalapeno thickburger with the purchase of ANY thickburger".
I tried to order the basic thickburger and get the free jalapeno one, but the young latina girl could not comprehend and tried to charge me for a jalapeno thickburger.
She finally called a female latina supervisor over who had little more grasp of English and said she could give me a senior discount which would make it less than the price of the BOGO jalapeno thickburger they charged me for.
I gave up and settled for that.
It wasn't worth the hassle.
I will say I like their sausage and egg biscuits in the morning, and I've never had a problem getting that order correct.

The absolute WORST cheeseburger I've ever been served in my life!
See the photo.
Zero stars.
Seems like every other hamburger place puts an 800 number or a link to their website so you can comment on the food/service.
Not this place.
Now I know what they are afraid of hearing/seeing.
