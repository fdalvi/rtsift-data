very happy thank you

Great Optometrist.
He took his time to get me the right prescription and also informed me about new cheaper options for my daily contact lenses.
I would recommend coming here.

So I went here last week for a walk in eye exam because I have had trouble seeing distances for a while.
I was in the actual exam in probably less than ten minutes.
I have never had glasses before, or even an exam, so this was all very new to me.
I found out I did need them and the preview I got was excellent.
I didn't realize I could see such things.
Haha The doctor was very nice and explained everything to me very well.
I will return here again definitely and I recommend anyone to go here.

Great place.
Quick and simple.
Eye exam was fast and thorough.
Walked out with my contacts :) will be returning and will recommend to others
