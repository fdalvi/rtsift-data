Love Bistro blends!
Hands down the best aged balsamic vinegar!
The fig is fantastic too!
Heirloom tomatoes shouldn't ever be without this liquid gold!
(That's what I call it) so yummy!

25-year old plus balsamic is a sauce unto itself.
The basic version goes well on anything from veggies to meat to yogurt (seriously!).
The fig balsamic you could eat with a spoon, and the other flavors are just as good.
They're so good I give bottles to friends and family as birthday gifts and they've all thanked me.
You cannot do better than to go with Bistro Blends!!!
As an aside, they do ship anywhere in the country, and I wouldn't get my balsamic anywhere else.

OMG I LOVE this stuff!!!
I used to buy the oils and vinegars all the time, primarily at the arts and craft shows in San Jose and Campbell Ca.
We moved to North Carolina 2 yrs ago and can not get this anywhere.
After the mind blowing devastation wore off and my brain clicked back on I went on line and ordered several bottles to keep me in good standing with the fam!!!
My favorite is the Basil Garlic Parmesan, I pour a little in a pan and add cut up chicken, bell peppers and onions... once its warmed put on a tortilla with some cheese a little lettuce and some ranch and it is the BEST chicken wrap ever

This us the BEST oil an vinegar on the planet!!
