I've been looking for a great Vietnamese Restaurant on the west side and I believe I found it.
Like others, it is a hole in a wall, but the difference is that that place is always busy.
Great tasting Pho and spring rolls, The rest of the menu items look great too!
Try it out, you wont be disappointed.
I feel a little rushed sometimes when I go in there, but it's definitely worth it.

Best VIET noodle soup in PHX ---Pho Sure!
My now estranged Love was sooo inspired by this place that he secretly texted his viet.
Xgf that night to rekindle old memories.
Guess he was inspired by the cheap prices and the hole in the wall decor.

Really good pho!
Fast service, got our appetizer right away and pho was soon to follow.

Best coffee of any Vietnamese restaurant.
So so so inexpensive!!!
Best sandwiches, best pho, best everything.
It's the quintessential hole in the wall.
Everything is a comforting about the food.
My ideal meal here is an order of spring rolls, barbecue pork sandwich, and hot coffee.
And when we go to pay I always pick up one of those chewy green coconut desserts.
My husband orders pho and I always drink the left over soup.
For about 10 bucks, you feast.
