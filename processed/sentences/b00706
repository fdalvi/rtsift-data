This place is Not Closed!
It is off the beaten path.. Veez is Old school.. Playboy magazines to yar at while your getting a cut and ashave.. Its laid back and doesn't apologize for it..
They have great girls working there... Virginia has been cutting my har for about 3 years now.. She takes about an hour with shampoo, and beard trim, and scalp massage..
If you want a Central Phoenix old school experience..
This is the place..

Only good things come out of this salon... My hair being one of them!
I see Mara who works in the second room.
Mara has been cutting my hair for some time now.
I recently decided to take the plunge and get some color added to my locks.
I got some small wispy highlights at the front and ombre.
So many compliments.
As with any stylist, photos and knowing what you want are helpful (they aren't mind readers!
)  If something doesn't turn out right, Mara is always willing to have you back and fix it for little/no charge.
You can even stop in for a bang trim if you're not quite due for the full cut.
This place is tucked away just off 7th St, next to a dance studio and Fuego Bistro.
If I'm running early for my appointment, I have happy hour snacks and sangria at Fuego... Makes for a fun time getting your hair did!
;-)

Great salon tucked next to Fuego Bistro.
I have been seeing Mara for years and I leave a happy customer every time.
I love that she knows how I like my hair cut and make sure that I don't chop it all off.
Mara offers fantastic hair cuts for a great price!
She offers hair coloring services and she does amazing work.
She's the best secret in Phoenix!
