This store is amazing!
I needed a "one of a kind" "interesting" piece of furniture for my living room.
I stopped into this store on my way to Costco on Hayden and found the perfect thing!
The detail on this cabinet was incredible!
If only I could post a photo!
The family that owns this business is really nice and very knowledgeable about everything on the floor!
I highly recommend this store for interesting, beautiful home furnishings!

They have beautiful things that no one else will have in their home.
I really enjoyed looking around in here.

Beautiful unique things and sales lady was awesome, cheerful and friendly!
A little out of the beaten path but thanks to yelp we found this great place!

After having sticker shock from another store very close to Eclectic Home, I stopped in to see what they had.
I was THRILLED!
I found several pieces of furniture at 1/3 of the cost.
June was great to work with and very helpful!
I will shop there often!
If you are looking for things that look like Restoration Hardware, it is a must stop!
One of a kind items for sure!

If you are in the market for unique, one-of-a-kind furniture stop into Eclectic Home.
Not only was I pleasantly surprised by how reasonable their prices were their selection was outstanding!
Loved the friendly customer service too from this family owned business.
Will definitely shop there again!
