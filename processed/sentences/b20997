An old fashioned pub and mostly frequented by locals, Spey Lounge is nevertheless welcoming enough to those stopping by for a quick pint.
The decor is fresh despite the "old man" feel of the place (I actually love old man pubs), and they serve up traditional pub fayre if you're hungry.
Prices are fairly cheap and although it's small, it can be quite relaxed and peaceful during the day.
Although I got the impression it was a pub designed for locals, I didn't get stared down - there wasn't anything Royston Vasey about it.
Instead, I found it a fairly nice place to drink.
Nothing too fancy, but one of the better pubs this side of Leith Walk.
