I have tried several other coffee roasters for espresso and nothing compares.
Anyone into coffee and espresso knows how important fresh roasted beans are.
This stuff is fresh.
It is roasted the same day I buy it!
Gold Nugget Espresso is delicious whether you drink as a straight shot, americano or latte.
It is a very forgiving blend - I have experimented with pulling shots at higher and lower temperatures and it's hard to pull a bad shot.
Good stuff!

Lost Dutchman Coffee sells green coffee beans in blends suitable for espresso as well as single origin.
After roasting at least 40lbs of LD coffee over most of a year, I have come up with a great roast 'Full City' roast profile for both of their espresso blends (Gold Nugget and Jacob's Dynamite) that has balanced acidity with a nice cocoa flavor.
I had more luck with LD coffee than Sweet Maria's blends so far.
Roasting coffee is tricky and even small changes in roasting temperature and timing produces significant changes in the flavor of the coffee, so your results will vary depending on your equipment and technique.
Get yourself a home coffee roaster (I use the Fresh Roast SR500 modded with a thermocouple) and try your hand at coffee roasting!
Its lots of fun and you get a fresh cup every time you brew.

Cool little shop in the middle of a strange industrial strip off to the side of the Tempe Marketplace area.
If you're looking to roast your own coffee, they sell various blends of green coffee beans.
They also sell roasting supplies/machines.
They are only open to the public during certain times, since their main business is roasting coffee rather than retail sales.
This place is a rare find, since green coffee beans are hard to come by locally!
