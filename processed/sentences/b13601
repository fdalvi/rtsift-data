"Buy one get one free Whopper" Don't count on it at this location.
I ordered a couple of #1's here, and instead of breaking it down like the store on Olive, they just charge you for both.
Don't question them about it.
When they dane to answer you, you will  get a rude and surly answer similar to "If you weren't smart enough to order it that way, your loss"  This kind of customer service does not earn your money, no matter how hungry you are

Horrible location.
Can never get fresh food.
It always tastes like they made the burgers 20 minutes ago and the fries are cold.
The drive thru is horrible.
Literally every single time I go I am asked to pull around to the front for my order, even if no one is behind me.
This is so their drive thru times look better than they actually are.
The one time I was not asked to go around front they asked me to back up and pull back up.
This was done so I would look like a new customer, again for drive thru times.
I am done with this location.
Too many other fast food chains around me to put up with that.

Burger King..
While I love Yelp, there are just some places that you go that really need no reviews.
Or if they do, a small one.
Now if I were going to a 5 star resort, sure I am going to take note of everything from driving up to driving away.
But I digress..   Fast drive thru service.
Food was hot, drink was cold.
The soda to ice ratio was spot on... Come on, really.. Are you going to decide to not eat here based on a Yelp review?!
Nope!
Its fast food.
Unless there is a bug crawling out of my fries, I ain't going to bitch!
Put on your Kings crown and dive in the ball pit!

Like the shakes.
Nothing else.
Burger King isn't that great but the shakes are very creamy.
I only went here 2 times.
I know I'm doing a review for a fast food chain but get the shakes please.

Beware of the mouth breather at the drive-through!
I've never seen someone mess up an order so many times in my life in the matter of minutes!
