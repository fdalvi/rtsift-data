Came here in a Saturday around 11:00 am.
Our party of four was waiting for five others.
It wasn't very busy, only 2 or 3 people were here.
We waited for the rest party and they came as we were being seated.
The restaurant looks very nice inside, but nondescript on the outside.
But it was somewhat hard to find;  it's in the same building as Chase Bank.
For lunch there was a large selection of food, but not too much in each tray.
My favorite was the coconut shrimp.
It was lightly breaded with not too much sauce and a little crunchy.
Almost everything I had tasted pretty good; nothing too much too complain about.
The only complaint I had was the temperature of the hot food-most of it was lukewarm and not piping hot.
This was kind of expected because there wasn't many people here.
Though once some of the items dwindled there was fresh food being prepared.
I would rather have good food lukewarm rather than bad tasting food hot.
The service here was very good.
Our plates were taken away as we went to get food.
Our water cups were filled without asking;  a rarity at Asian restaurants.
All in all a pretty decent experience.
This is a place I'd like to come back to if they are still open.

Isn't it great when a new Buffet pops up?
Today I had the pleasure of trying this one for the first time, accompanied by Robyn N. & Norm R.  This place appeared in the shell formerly occupied by Crazy Buffet #2, and they don't seem to have changed it much, if at all, except that it's slightly less expensive.
Here were some other observations on this visit:  THE GOOD:  *  Nice dining room.
*  Friendly staff.
*  Reasonable prices.
*  Most food items properly identified.
*  Proper lighting for both the food and the dining room.
*  Big selection of 111 food items plus sauces & dressings.
*  Medium selection of tasty Sushi.
*  Good Mongolian style BBQ with 4 meats & treats including water chestnuts, bamboo, etc.
A FEW SHORTCOMINGS:  *  It was too warm inside.
*  They didn't have quite all of the food out at 11 AM opening time.
*  Their drinking water had a snarky taste.
It needs filtering.
*  The Sushi table didn't have separate tongs for each item, including the meats.
*  The soft ice cream machine was out of order.
They need to tighten things up a little here but overall I think it's a nice place.
Weekday Lunch Buffet:  $7.99/$7.19 Sr.

I would say that the food I had here at lunch with Rand H. and Robyn N. was quite good, a bit above 3-stars.
Some of the dishes, such as sushi and chicken wings, were a bit below par here, but  I'll bump up my rating to 4 because I did enjoy most of the items here, the price of the meal was very reasonable,  the restaurant itself was very clean and nicely appointed, and the service was very efficient and friendly.
