Great service.
Very welcoming and great tasting bagels.

Agh!
Ordered a bagel with cream cheese and thought it was the jalapenos that were funky til I realized the cream cheese was SOUR!!!!
If they are not busy enough to sell plain cream cheese before it sours...

I found the staff very friendly and welcoming and my sandwich (Leonardo DaVeggie) and pickle delicious.
The iced tea was also very fresh.
I would not hesitate to go back and try something else.

I haven't seen one of these in quite a while.
They still have great fresh bagels.

Well, I've stopped by here dozens of times (lol) to pick up a baker's dozen bagels to take in for my office staff, and a few times for lunch bagels, etc.
Always friendly staff, always great bagles and cream cheeses.
I was really happy to see this place open up so close to my office as it was a quick stop on the way in at 6:45am to grab a quick treat for the team.
Unfortunately, I went to grab a dozen this morning and the location is closed.
Confirmed with another store that this store closed it's doors on 10/6/13.
I'm sad.
