I love this station.
The hosts aren't annoying.
They are in tune w/ world, nation, and city wide events and news.
The music is not watered down.
I love it.
I like how they have the NPR news every morning @ 7, 8, and 10 am.
Good stuff.
I'd recommend that anyone looking for a break on the non-culture that Vegas has to offer, should listen to this sation.
You will definitley enjoy it.

Take me back Tuesdays by DJ Remix make the drive to work smoother, blasing old-school hip hop  and R&B jams from back in the day...From James Brown, to Sugar Hill Gang, New Edition to Soul Sonic Force, its all here..
If it sounds like I'm speaking your music language, check Power 88 Out!...ALOHA!!!
YELP 365-CHALLENGE(22/365) "Back in the Day"

friday nites at the colosseum, a pair of rollerskates and a whistle..   way back in the day..   toot  toot aaaaa beep beep    shout out to taro

I'm new to the LV but this station is becoming my new guilty pleasure!
OMG, you guys are playing stuff no one does and stuff that makes you say, "I forgot they sung that!
" I am loving it!
They don't even dig deep in the crates back in L.A. like your station does.
And, the Saturday morning blues, man, that blows me away!
Floyd Taylor, daddy Johnnie, the songs dedicated to the trash men; I TRULY LOVE IT!
Gospel music on Sunday!
This is how I found this station a month ago, looking for gospel music after church.
LOVE THIS STATION!
