The Royal Kabob is another random find thanks to the super cheap gift certificates at restaurant.com.
My girlfriend and I were super excited to try this place as it looked really cool from the pictures on the web site and it was reasonably close to our houses.
Unfortunately, when we pulled up, we realized they made it look much better in the pictures as it was just in a strip mall.
We then proceeded to have a very awkward waitress take care of us.
She wasn't bad, per say, but considering the place was empty, it was a little slow.
And just everything about her serving technique seemed awkward.
For example, when bringing out some pita bread and dipping sauces, I had to pry out of her the information of what each sauce was, rather than get a standard explanation of what they were.
The food itself was tasty... if it wasn't for the fact that the place wasn't visually appealing and the service was strange, we'd be back.
But seeing as how we couldn't stop talking about it while we were there, we'll probably pass and go somewhere else next time.
Food alone?
3 1/2 stars.
But overall, only a 2 star for me.

Restaurant is closed as of 2/09/10.
The sign is gone, and although the lights were on and tables were set inside, they quickly turned off the lights as we pulled up in front of the building.
They went back on as we left.
The phone number is now disconnected too.
