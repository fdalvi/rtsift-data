Ordered a large cheese pizza.
The crust was ok, not very flavorful.
The pie had a pool of grease covering it.
This pizza had a bland sauce and very little of it.
It just seemed that minimal effort went into the pizza.
This pizza is not worth a second visit.

Great authentic New York style pizza.
The place is beat up, but who cares, the pizza is great!

I love the Big Bite sandwich.
The 12 inch sandwich feeds two of us for lunch.
I must say that the big apple pizza has great flavor but I recommend the thinner crust if you want to eat more than one piece.
I just wish they delivered.

I have seen this place for years and decided to stop and try it out.
I order a large pizza.
It was good and fresh.
I will go back again.
The only thing  I didn't like was they charge 75 cents for a soda refill.
Who doesn't have free refills on the pop these days?

We just happened into this place while out on a driving adventure.
Place is dirty inside, could really use an update, but the FOOD WAS AWESOME.
We had a great salad, terrific spaghetti and meatballs, delicious sauce - but by far the best thing was the Cheese Bread and the FRESH BAKED ROLLS.
The food alone is reason enough to go back - we will, and just close our eyes to the place while eating and enjoying the food!
