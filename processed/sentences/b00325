This place is only open at night.
Like 5-9pm.
The owner is always working.
He can tell you everything about anything in the store.
He's helped me learn alot about scotch and wines.
Thanks Mike.
Fair prices, great deals (he's got an orphan bin for wines) and Mike will work with you if you are on a low budget to find something that is quality for the price.
awesome.

Always friendly and knowledgable.
Glad he's just down the street!

There's a rule in my family.
When you buy a house, make sure that you can walk to a liquor store.
This comes from the need to keep stocked in winters where you might not be able to drive, leaving you and your family shut in for a few days, disgustingly sober!
Oh the horror!!
I can walk to Mike's.
It's a small place but lacks nothing.They have an excellent wine selection, fully stocked distillates and a good selection of beer ...  all reasonably priced.
No pretense, nothing snooty just a good selection that won't break the bank.
Last summer, when it was so hot, I was looking for some vinho verde.
Vinho verde is a light, dry, somewhat fizzy and citrusy white wine from Portugal that is great summer drinking and, most importantly when drinking heavily, it tends to be cheap.
He had a really decent one, on sale for $5/bottle!!
More than reasonable!
I've walked way further for way less.
Way to go, Mike's!
