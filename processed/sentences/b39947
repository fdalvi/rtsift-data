I always order pizza from here when we're in the mood for pizza; rarely if ever.
I have ordered through theirn online service every time and I've never had a problem.
I have gone and picked up the pizza myself and have had it delivered, both times the staff has been nice.
Since I don't like many of the other pizza places around I will continue to order from here.
If no Peter piper pizza delivered.

I phoned ahead for my order and it was a busy, busy Saturday night for the workers.
They told me only 15 minutes for 2 supremes.
Wow.
I got there in 15 minutes, and they were ready for me!
Wow!
Fresh.
Hot.
Delicious pizza.
Courteous attentive staff.
The delivery staff coming and going showed passion for their jobs in making sure the pizzas got out to the customers as efficiently as possible.
I wish all Dominos were like this one.

The pizza itself was mediocre at best, I ate it but it's nothing to write home about.
$20.00 for one large 3 topping pizza is a bit pricey I think.
Delivery time was off by 15 minutes late.
And to top it all off, when paying by card you are asked to add a tip when the driver gets there.
WTF?
I,m being charged a separate DELIVERY CHARGE and I'm expected to tip too?
Isn't the tip the delivery charge?
Hell, why not throw on a road tax charge of a couple bucks and maybe a fuel tax charge and an environment tax charge, then you can justify $30.00 for a pizza.
There's gotta be something better than this.
