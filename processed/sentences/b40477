Just stopped by here today for the first time, 10/10!!
I usually go to silver mines but on the way there I decided to try this joint instead since it was new.
Customer service is ON POINT, the two guys (white, manager I think?
And black guy) helped me out and they were very nice.
I love putting all sorts of condiments on my Sandwich and they put exactly the appropriate amount and it tastes fantastic!
The only downside is really the price (14" for $11) is really harsh for a college student especially when subway is $5 for 12" (but subway is incredibly inferior compared to these guys).
Worth it, will come back here again.

I didn't get a chance to eat there, my review is based entirely on their ordering system/service...  As I walked in I noticed that there was one table with food and 8-10 tables holding tickets looking at the kitchen.
In front of me a bunch of people bottle necked in line - trying to figure out the order form.
No way I'm waiting for this, only an hour for lunch...

Which Wich was very new to me and I'm sure a lot of people At first I did not get the ordering system I stood standing there wondering what to do with the brown bags But I figured it out I think it's a pretty good way to order but I think the paying part and actually processing your order is where the line sort of starts From there you pay and then the "line" of workers make your order The cuban sandwich was pretty good The size was good as well The only baby complaint I had was the bread, maybe next time I won't get it toasted It felt a little too flaky and dry But the sandwich was good and I am not very hard to please The decor is nice and the manager was friendly

Amazing sandwiches !!!!
Amazing selection  Awesome cookie  Recommend this place guys

Heard about Which Wich from a friend and it was as good as he said it was.
Ordered the Cuban sandwich and it was as good as it is in Miami.
Loved the bread and the hot peppers.
This is now our new favorite sandwich place.

I had never heard of them but the kids thought that the name was funny/inviting.
We are greeted promptly and asked if it was our first time.
They explained the ordering system quickly.
Our 'wiches were made to order promptly and they were delicious.
Later I googled them and found that they are a new chain and are opening stores all over.
They are worth a try!

The Chipotle of sandwich shops finally arrives on Mill Avenue!
With an amazing selection and average pricing, Which Wich is a solid choice for your carb cravings.
(Although, all sandwiches can be served in a bowl too-- if you're into that kind of thing).
Much better than your run of the mill Subway, and much better looking too!

I can't believe this place only has 6 reviews when it has been open 3 or 4 months already.
I stopped in today for lunch and the place was packed but most people take theirs to go.
Basically, it's a sandwich shop, with similar options to Subway (tastes much better) but a totally different ordering system.
First you pick up a brown paper bag; the bags are all labeled according to the category of sandwich you are going to get (which more or less is based on the type of meat).
Then you mark on the bag with the sharpie provided what type of bread and size you want, toppings and condiments, whether you'd like it toasted or cold, etc.
Then you hand the bag to the guy at the register, grab chips and a drink cup, and pay for your food.
The bag goes to the folks making your food and when your sandwich is done they call out your name and you come to the counter and get it.
Oh, yeah, forgot to mention don't forget to put your name on your bag.
The spot for your name is at the very bottom and it is easy to miss.
It actually helps if you put your initials or some kind of mark on the back of the back so you can see it making it's way down the line and then you'll know when you are next.
They actually have a wall of bags with some cool drawings that people have made on their bags.
Other than that, the restaurant itself is your basic fast food ambiance.
Nothing too special.
They do have a couple of small tables outside on Mill Ave so that is cool.
Plus, it's only a short walk to Tempe Beach Park so grab some food and get out and enjoy a picnic in the sunshine!!

Worst sandwich I have ever had from any place ever.
So bad it pissed me off after 2 bites of yuck that I didnt eat the rest.
The meat is beyond gross with all kinds of salt and preservatives and other chemicals added.
The quality to me was something like the cheapest deli meat you would find in the grocery store but not from the deli.
You know what I am talking about.
Mystery meat.

The use of a "complex" ordering system keeps the low iq people, like the gentleman below out.
The sandwich was soooo good.
The muffeletta had an awesome tapenade, cronic.
A little pricey, but they pile the meat on there.
The 3star review is because of the bossy manager lady constantly yelling and micro managing the lackeys like she was Gordon Ramsey.
Oh.
They have melloyello, too.

I'm a big fan of this new spot in the Mill Ave District.
You order by filling in the extensive options on a paper bag which made it very easy to create the sandwich exactly how you want.
This place can get very busy during the lunch hours; however, the ordering system allows the lines to move along fairly quick.
I would recommend not getting the lettuce wrap option because it can be very messy.
(Yelp check-in gets you a free bag of chips!

Overall my experience at which wich was meh.
I came in on a Sunday there where a few people in line nut not many.
I'm mainly disappointed at the quality of the deli meat which was very salty and much resembled typical cheap processed deli meat.
Even worse, the price did not reflect the quality at all.
8.25 for a 10" is a good price when the deli meat is high quality but not for whatever they are using.
The service was meh as well.
Maybe they all had the Sunday blues but other then the cashier who was pleasant and actually smiled ( I think his name was Andrew), no one even really made an effort to be happy or go out of their way.
My wich had cucumbers in it which I am willing to write off as an honest mistake.
I asked for a side of pesto as there wasn't very much on my wich and received a small, less then half full Togo sauce container.
It was enough for one half of one side.
The employee never smiled once.
Overall, had the meat been better it would have been pretty decent.
The bread was ok but a little dry when toasted.
I won't come back though simply because of the price and awful quality of meat.

Which Wich is my new on-the-go sandwich spot.
Great value for a solid, customizable sandwich.
And the owner is a friendly, enthusiastic guy whose cool glasses should be appreciated by all!
