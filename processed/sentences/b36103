This is great bank.
Remember when banking was personal well MidFirst is what banking used to be.
Their friendly knowledgeable staff have worked with us on our personal banking and business banking.
I have recommended them to my friends and family.
They also have a great kids program for savings.
Their hours are great too open Sat.
and Sun.

Friendly and helpful staff.
Clean interior, not as nice as some of the other branches interior design but it's still a great bank :)

How can you not give this bank a 5-star?
It opens on Sunday, most banks don't.
It extend their business hours Mondays thru Fridays, most banks don't.
It gives you unlimited uses of other banks' ATM and reimburse you with the fees, again, most banks don't give you that options at all, unless you have a lot of money in their bank and they maybe will give you 1 to 2 times free monthly.
Really enjoy banking with this bank, check them out.
