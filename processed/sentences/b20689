It's always busy here!
Avoid between 3&4 on week days as there are kids all over the shop.
Pretty much another average supermarket.

Ahh, me thinks Tesco at Dalkeith should take lessons from their people at the Musselburgh store.
The check out operator was a tad on the sullen side.
T'was here to pick up some food for dinner tonight.
