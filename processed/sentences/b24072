Great help getting membership setup.
Only $29 a month too.
Good equipment and it's open 24/7.

Just joined AF- first time fitness club member & am very happy I did.
Friendly & very helpful staff, variety of people working out from newbies to muscle heads.
Clean, well functioning equipment.
Only downside: just 2 bathrooms which can be a problem at busy times.
