I love rag o'rama's New Tempe location!
Their grand opening isn't until the 31st!
But they are OPEN now!
The store has changed  dramatically, its bright well lit and upbeat  I always find the greatest deals here!
Got beautiful bold colored striped shirt for $3.
And a pair of brand new shoes, marked 50 percent off!
$3.50!!!
And the buyers and sellers do not have that terribly familiar, I am so much better than you attitude!

Went in to check out down street from my hairdresser, sorry just a meh 2 star, kinda small and cheap costumes.
I will stick with Buffalo Exchange or Rocket Resale.
sorry really wanted to like store, but after looking I wasnt able to find something I had to have.
Music played in store was good.
Parking on side.

Walked in and immediately found a pair of knee high soft leather boots for 25.00.
WIN.
They have 50% off racks that hide even cheaper little treasures.
I want to move to Phoenix so I can visit this store weekly!

Everyone at Rag-o-Rama was really kind and helpful.
Like any used clothing store it is hit or miss.
The first time I went in I found a purse right away and the second time I found a shirt right away.
Great and fair prices!

Found some super cute vintage items at this place!
The prices were great too.
I almost didn't go because of the three $$$ here on yelp.
I found that to be extremely inaccurate tho.
I think this place is definitely less expensive than rocket or buffalo.
The girls working were really friendly and cute as well.
If I lived in town, I'd be back for sure!

Nice variety; staff friendly, helpful & not pushy.
Clean.
Well organized.
Not sure where the three dollar signs come from bc everything was very reasonably priced.
Bought six items for under $40.
