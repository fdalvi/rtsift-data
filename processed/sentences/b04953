When we moved in here we were in a rush moving from out of state.
I had a great new job and we were looking forward to big increase in the quality of living moving from Los Angeles to here, and the apartment we were showed assured our home would be a huge upgrade.
I walked up the front door of my new apartment to find the key I was given didn't even work.
I took a trip back to the office and was informed that they make their own keys and sometimes they don't work.
Well, it's not that big of deal to walk back to the office before I get into my apartment.
I now see that it was a sign of how this place is managed.
Figure out a way to do it yourself rather than hire a professional seems to be thier motto.
Upon moving in, I saw the dream was over.
The carpet was so bad it was amazing that it hadn't been cleaned at all from the previous tenant.
There were spots and cigarette burns everywhere, but after such a huge move we didn't have time to complain, and we just planned on cleaning it ourselves after we moved in.
After moving in we realized that the spots on the carpet had already probably been cleaned, and proven impossible to remove.
Why would they have rented that to me after showing me an apartment with pristine carpet?
Unfortunately the carpet was just the beginning.
We performed our pre-move in inspection, which of course we weren't even allowed into the apartment before we were given keys after signing our lease.
We were completely led to believe we would be receiving a place comparable at leaset to the apartment we were shown, but the inspection list became a novel of dilapidation.
The microwave didn't work, which means the grease vent over the stove didn't work either.
The faucet on the sink leaked water everywhere.
The shelves in the pantry were broken and lying on the floor.
Their was a handle missing from the wet bar sink, there were cigarette burns on the counters on the bathrooms.
After reporting all of these things, we were told that maintenance is too backed up right now, and you'd get to it soon.
I believe that if maintenance is too busy to prepare apartments properly for move in, then you are too busy to be renting any new apartments.
Do you agree?
I demanded that maintenance come immediately to fix everything, and it began one of 8 visits to perform simple repairs.
The first guy to come was named Rick, and he informed me that my microwave couldn't be fixed, and he needed to order a new one and it would take one week, and he would fix the rest when he brought the new unit in.
After 2 weeks I came back to the office to complain about this and I had a new maintenance person show up who couldn't read english.
I know this, because he asked me to read the work order to him.
He then proceeded to take apart the microwave to "fix" it.
He also decided it couldn't be fixed and told me he would order a new one.
I informed him that one should have already been ordered, but he told me that it was not.
The following week Rick returned and informed me that the microwave had been ready for 2 weeks.
He had no reason for not installing it when it came in, just a shrug and a confused look when I asked.
He tried for about 20 minutes to install the microwave before telling me he needed to leave and get new tools.
After 30 minutes past without him returning I installed it myself.
He returned to take his tools back about an hour later.
Do you think it's reasonable for tenants to have to install their own appliances?
How do you ensure that your maintenance is competent to do simple tasks like this?
I was told that the handle on the sink couldn't be replaced, and I would just have to deal with only having the hot handle on the sink.
Rick replaced the faucet in the kitchen that was leaking water, and told me he couldn't figure out why all the red and blue temperature caps on the knobs are always backwards.
I figured it out when he left, since the sink was still leaking.
He put in on backwards, and since they "always" put them on backwards, it tells me he installs all of them backwards.
Does this sound like competent maintenance?
Is it reasonable for a tenant to need to reinstall a faucet that your people installed backwards?
I eventually fixed the shelves in the pantry myself, and refused to call maintenance again until my ancient fridge quit working and let all my food spoil over the weekend while I was out of town.
When I got back and threw away all of my spoiled food, I called maintenance and was told that the fridge seemed to be working again, and they wouldn't replace it unless it was broken when they inspected it.
Do you think it's reasonable for a tenant to keep a fridge that has already cost them over a hundred dollars in spoiled food?
I demanded a new unit, and eventually they complied.
As for the grounds, I was told the pools and weight room were 24 hours when I moved in.
I've since seen that they are often locked up without any sign of why they are closed.

We moved here from LA temporarily until we could buy our dream house.
We didn't see the apartment or its sorroundings before we moved in; I was dealing with one of the assistants and she sent me some pictures.
I call other apartment complexes and none of them offered short term leases such as 6 months, so we had no choice but to move here.
If you walk around; you'll notice A LOT of dog poop.
Maintenance guys try to do their job; however, it's just impossible to keep up.
These people are nasty!
I have a dog and when I walked her around (with my 8 month son on his carrier attached to my chest) I would still pick up after my dog so I don't understand why others can't do the same.
The manager at that time (don't remember her name) was super helpful and nice.
They changed all staff since we moved out.
When we got to the apartment the carpet was filthy even when it was still humid when we moved in.
One of the kitchen burners and the microwave didn't work properly.
The maintenance guy came because I put pressure since we just moved in and deserve working appliances.
They agreed and sent a guy the next day.
The maintenance guy said he could not fix it and needed to order a new one.
I asked to get another one from an empty apartment and get it installed and the next person could wait for the microwave.
They agreed too.
Even when they were busy fixing other apartments; I would always get someone in 3 days maximum which was not bad if it wasn't an emergency.
The security deposit was only 100$ (which is not bad even with my dog).
We never got it back.
Parking is bad!
We only had a carport for one car far away from our apartment and my husband had to get a spot anywhere else.
We were there for almost 5 months and the manager was nice enough to work with us in moving out.
We gave out two month notice but since we were having difficulties and didn't know exactly when we were moving out; she kept the date open.
Fortunately, we didn't have that bad of an experience here.
It just wasn't great either but it was a good transition place for us.
However , I wouldn't live here for a long time.

By far the worst experience of my life.
I had gone into the office and worked with Francine with my apartment search.
She was nice and addressed my concerns.
Although she complained about her coworkers and a fellow apartment renters child being sick and all the girls in the office joked about who could be the bigger B**ch to this lady.
All that should have been red flags but, I gave Francine the benefit of the doubt.
The floor plan of the apartment I wanted was not available at the time.
I was showed the smaller 2 bed/2 bath and was told "I would love the large floor plan".
So I went in the office and told Francine I want to rent the next Large Floor plan you have toward the end of March (as my current rent was paid through March).
I was told the apartment I wanted would open the end of Feb and would go fast.
So I decided I will hold that one and put $100 down and have Francine run my credit (I have GREAT credit so of course no issue there).
My move in date was 3/7/14 over two weeks away.
I we planned on doing a walk through the day before we move in just to make sure everything was perfect.
Fast forward to the day before we move in.. my fiance and I head over to the apartments for our scheduled walk through.
We arrive and another lady advises us the apartment is no where near ready but will be ready for us to move in the next day.
I tell her I have a 5 month old and would really like to see the unit prior to move in and it is pushing it close if there are any issues.
She said the unit would be fine and would show us the unit the next morning.
I ask her for her head supervisor and she provides Dana's phone number.
I contact Dana and explain my situation and am asked "what I would like"?!..
no I'm sorry...NOTHING.
Long story short I am advised my unit will be move in ready to go first thing in the morning if not there is a back up unit that is move in ready.
So the next morning we show up for our walk though and are advised Francine is walking the apartments.
25 minutes later I ask if Francine is the only person who is able to show an apartment and am advised anyone can show an apartment.
Just then Francine walks in and is a total different person.
She is very rude, condescending and a complete B**tch!
I ask if we are able to see our unit and she says.. "I know you spoke with Dana and to be Frank your unit is not ready and I can not show it to you could you come back at noon?".
I then ask about the alternate unit and she says "that unit is not ready either".
I ask if we could see that unit and she says "I guess I will meet you there" luckily Dana told me the number of that apartment.
As I walk into that unit I just start crying, it is a mess... patchwork carpet, the screen needs replacing, the drawers and cupboards are a wreck there are stains and dead cockroaches, the bathroom needs new tile work, new paint was needed.. how am I supposed to let my son crawl around this apartment.
I already switched my address over, turned on utilities, rented and packed a uhaul truck and had family come into town to help us move.
Francine CLEARLY knew the issues of this apartment and said she would send someone right over to fix everything.
I ask Francine if we were to switch apartments could they hold my mail from the other apartment.. she said "of course".
She then says she will meet us back at the office so we can decide what we want to do.
When we arrive at the office we ask if we could get our money back as this whole process was a mess and we would like to think about our options at this time.
Francine says "Dana said she would refund you if that is what you decide".
We tell her we would like a refund.
I call Dana and leave multiple voice mails (which were never returned) I then call Crystal creek and ask for a supervisor who is extremely rude and has no remorse for what we have gone through trying to rent an apartment from them.
She said it would be illegal to hold any mail for me and that it was inappropriate of me being frustrated.
This issue is still ongoing.
