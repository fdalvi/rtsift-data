It's hard to review this place because well, Harbor Freight seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it type of place.
Some people just can't stand the tightly packed stuff or the general feel of the place, but bargain hunters immediately see the huge variety of low-cost goods they have here.
This location, in particular, was cleaner and more organized than most.
Some locations are really run down and less cared for.
While you can find some real junk here, there are a lot of gems to be found also.
Their air tools, for example, have never let me down.
They sell for 1/2 or less of the major brands, and have always worked just as well for me.
I would NOT recommend things that are supposed to be sharp, such as drill bits, saw blades, and the like.
They are almost always junk.
Their hand tools have a lifetime warranty, and while I only have a couple of them, they have worked just fine.
This is THE place to buy the little stuff like gloves, brushes, cleaning supplies, and similar items that you just can't screw up.
The price on nitrile work gloves is about 1/4 of any other place.
Look coupons online before you go!

Ladies great place for tools for your crafting projects, not to mention the ladies room is cleaner than I expected (that's important to us ladies).
Good prices too.

What is there to really say.
Inexpensive, throw away tools that get the job done.
They have great, cheap consumables like grinding wheels but I wouldn't expect their grinder to last more than a few jobs.
