These guys are known for producing custom built off-road recreational vehicles, but my need was something very different.
I was creating a steel cage to cover a custom built speaker box for my vehicle, but the thickness of the steel I was working with was much to rigid  for the average person to shape.
Thus, I came upon Foddrill Fabrication.
On approach to the address, I passed by more than once due to the building looking like a residential home.
I believe the building observable from W Union Hills Drive IS a home.
A quick phone call later, and I was directed to the North end of the property, where the metal fabrication shop was found behind a large sliding push gate.
Several employees were actively working on creating the custom vehicles the company is known for, and a large bald man greeted me near an open garage door.
I explained what I wanted him to do, and he got right to it.
25 minutes later, the work was done and I have no complaints.
The bends were accurate and the fit was just right.
Afterward, he directed me to the office and a very polite woman told me "no charge".
Considering that these guys get $35 for a half hour of work, I was ecstatic.
Much like my previous post, the shop is very blue collar, but the results are outstanding.
Highly recommended.

These guys are as good as it gets.
Custom fab work is no problem.

Where is their Website??
