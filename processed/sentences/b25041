We arrived with my 3 year old  daughter who was so excited and nervous about her first trip to the dentist.
I told the front office staff upon check-in that I did not want her to have x-rays since she was very young and had no issues.
Just wanted a basic teeth cleaning.
This was not a $$ issue as my whole family is covered under Humana Dental.
The office staff balked at me and pulled out a binder that had information on radiation.
I said I understand there is low radiation with dental radiographs as I am in the medical field, I am declining them, however.
They then said the dentist would then not see my daughter today without x-rays!
I asked if the dentist could just do a brief exam and cleaning since my daughter was counting on this today- they literally turned me down and I walked out.
Went to another dentist who did the cleaning and had no problem with my wishes.
How will they stay in business?

I am so impressed with Dr. Nett and the staff at Happy Valley Pediatric Dentistry.
They are very professional, yet have such a good manner with kids.
Her staff is upbeat and friendly.
Dr. Nett walked through my children's treatment plan with me, explaining everything very clearly.
I would highly recommend this practice!
