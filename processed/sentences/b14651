A little hard to find but, well worth the effort.
They are great supporters of the military personel.

This place is great.
The staff is VERY helpful for the novice.
More importantly for me they never made me feel like an idiot no matter how many questions I have.
The recommendations for me were spot on.
David is an awesome guy too.
He really has put his money where his mouth is in supporting our Armed Forces.

Great selection and help.
Also nice place to have a smoke and hang out and BYOB.

Great shop!
I found this place when googled a shop in the area.
When I arrived I was greeted by the west host director, Brad, and he showed me around and suggested some great smokes.
There overall selection is great and the customer service was exceptional.
I enjoyed a cup of coffee and a cigar and have been returning since because of the customer service I received.
The only reason it is not five star is the pricing is a bit higher than I am used to, but not too high considering the brotherhood that is present at the speakeasy.
Highly recommend this place, I am glad I found it and it is worth the extra 50cents I pay for a cigar.
Keep up the good work!

First, they have an awesome selection of cigars - everything from $4 Perdomos to $20 high-end Gurkhas and everything in between.
If they don't have it, you probably don't need or want it.
Second - they have military lines of cigars, made by Oliva.
I can't speak for all of them, but the Army cigar I had was one of the best mild smokes I'd had in a while.
I'll make a point of picking them up every time I'm in the area.
Third - staff was friendly, helpful, and not pushy at all.
All in all, this is a perfect place to sit down, have a cigar, and watch sports or news.
I'd be in there every day if I lived in the area.
As it is, I'm going to make it a go-to place when we're in town.
