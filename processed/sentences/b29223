I always get a bit excited when I go anywhere near a music shop.
I love music shops, I could spent hours in them.
Imagine my excitement, then, when I see a brand new one open just minutes from my flat.
It was fairly short-lived, it has to be said.
First of all, they don't sell drums.
They don't sell any percussion.
Which is a shame, that's my instrument.
But I guess that's reserved for the magnificent Drum Central down the road.
They do, however, have a decent selection of guitars (the cowboy guitars, complete with authentication certificates at £49 particularly caught my eye), ukuleles, banjos, accordions and a few brass and wind instruments.
They've also got a reasonable selection of sheet music.
There's nothing much wrong with the place, it's just there are much better music shops in the area.
Might be worth a look if you're struggling elsewhere.

Great wee shop have had my guitar setup twice at Mev Taylor's both times for about £20.
My guitar came back feeling great and setup to a high standard.
I also think the price for gear is very reasonable all in all good honest music shop, highly recommended
