I've been with them well over two years, going on nearly three now and I've never experienced any problems with the staff.
They're really helpful and really friendly.
They've helped me replace many a debit card and they helped me when my identity was stolen and bank account cleaned out with  no hassles.
From my own experience I want to give them a five for how awesome they've been, but if we have to be nitpicky I hate this locale because of the smelllllllllllll this particular branch has.
I'm a guy, but this place smells horrendous it's like a mixture of old, paint and pesticide smell.
It's tough to bear and it hits your nostrils immediately upon entering.
I'm not one to complain, but I know I can't be the only one to experience this.
I'll give 'em  a 4 of 5 though.
Aside from the smell, their customer service more than makes up for the stench these poor people  go through on the daily.

This weekend my dog had an accident fractured his jaw in two places and his nasal cavity and under his left eye.
My puppy needed surgery, I rushed him to an emergency clinic, $700 bill there.
Paid it with my One Nevada debit card.
We had to transfer my puppy to the emergency surgery clinic on Durango, which was a great emergency clinic.
I was going to have to leave my puppy overnight which was expected and he was going to have surgery the following morning.
So I had to pay for his overnight care, and the low estimate for the surgery.
The first bill was $684, then for surgery $2,200.
When I tried to run my One Nevada Debit card again it was coming up DECLINED.
So I called One Nevada fraud protection alert to clear the charges, they asked me to verify charges, and I had let them know I will be making two charges right now so I need the card to be activated.
The person I talked to said it "Should work now, if not call your financial institution" Well its Saturday evening, and One Nevada is closed on the weekends.
I had the card run again and still did not go through, so we waited 5 minutes before  trying again; of course no luck.
I called the Fraud protection number again, they asked me to verify more charges even further back, I explained I need the card to work now; this is an emergency.
The person sounded like the same person I talked to previously, continued to say if it doesn't work contact your financial institution.
Are you kidding ME???
The card did not work.
If all of my money is on one card with more than enough to pay the hospital bills it should work when I need it.
I tried transferring money to my credit card, but that won't clear for 2-3 business days.
So ONE NEVADA has all my money and I cannot use it in an emergency situation because they are closed on weekends and their Fraud Protection cant reactivate my card.
I understand the point of the fraud protection..
Your protecting me, but when I need my money I should be able to use it.
Especially in an emergency situation where the life of my family member is at risk.
It's safe to say I will be pulling all my money out of my account.
I would really hate for this to happen to anyone else.
I was able to use another credit card Thank God!!!!

Staff was extremely polite and friendly.
They took their time explaining their programs and options available.
Even better was the short wait time!
