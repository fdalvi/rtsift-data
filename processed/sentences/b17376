There you are.....in Vegas......too many bars to choose from....how do you choose?
However, the Houdini's lounge in the Monte Carlo is calling your name.
Set right off the casino, this bar can transport you.
The dark red/burgandy chairs/curtains and dark wood tables/bar just relax you for a moment of the hustle and bustle outside this rich oasis.
Obviously, the drinks are the specialty here.
Martini's anyone?
These talented bartenders....more like mixologists.....can create you a masterful martini that tastes just like angel food cake, chocolate cake or even keylime pie.
No not all drinks here are desserts.
If you are looking for a clean and classic martini, you are in Bond's heaven.
Basically your taste with the imagination of these mixologists, you might have just found your "new" drink.

Gag.
I was totally underwhelmed by the drinks here.
I  had read several stories of people coming here for fantastic drinks, but I was unimpressed.
First of all, this whole casino/bar area was under construction which made the atmosphere less than appealing.
The drink menu was adequate, and they offered cigars which made my SO happy, but the drinks weren't anything special, especially for the asking price.
I was expecting "knock me off my socks" impressive for the City of Sin, but I've had better in Austin.

Not impressive at all.
Like Houdini himself, this place should disappear.
