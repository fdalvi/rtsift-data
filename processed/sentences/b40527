I've been going to Ciera for 7 years and she's always done a great job and I recommend her to everyone looking for a new stylist.

I have been going to Cassie for almost two years now and every time I go in she out does herself.
The color is always perfect!
She always knows exactly what I want.
As long as I'm in Arizona I will always go to Cassie.

Ciera is AMAZING!
It's hard to find someone who understands what you want...especially wanting to be blond.
Ciera has been cutting, highlighting, and adding extensions to my hair for over a year now.

Love the location and the salon is super cute.
Ciera cut and colored my hair.
Left looking and feeling like a new woman!
Will def go back.

best salon around!
Cierra does amazing work with hair.
I have naturally thick, curly hair and she does magic on it every time!
I leave her salon I couldn't be happier with my hair!
I highly recommend this salon, it's the perfect little spot to get pampered and get the perfect cut!

I have been going to Ciera for 6 years!
Wouldn't let anyone else touch my hair.
I get so many compliments on my hair.
She works magic!
I highly recommend her!
