Excellent property, very clean and my belongings are safe.
Friendly and professional staff.
Lots of hell from the day we moved in!
I'd highly recommend this property.

Jasmine and Josh were great to work with and very helpful.
Thank you for your service.

We reviewed several storage options in Las Vegas for a 10x15 space to store furniture, etc.
We were fairly confident that we'd be renting storage at another location and were doing due diligence to make sure it was a good deal.
Turns out that while it was a good deal, this place was better!
Clean, well lit and air conditioned at a better price!
And Deesa was very helpful and genuine - much appreciated!
So we switched over to this location and the move-in was painless and quick.
Would recommend them as a good value and a place that treats customers well.
