Stopped in this herbal shop on the way to Flag.
This place has tons of "Herbs and More" stuff.
I saw some great glycerin products like rose water and glycerin.
I was tempted to buy a bottle, but I was honestly only in this store because I had stopped and had a mediocre slice of pie next door.
This store offers a large selection of pure herbs.
There are salts and healing rocks inside as well.
The shop has plenty of printed documents on herbal therapy too.
I saw some photos of various fungal infections with the list of herbal remedies that could be used to cure the fungal infection.
Thats if you are into  diagnosing your own irritatiins insidw your mouth or other places.
I would have bought a cup of herbal tea if they offered it.... at least, that was the thought I had when I saw the "and more" in the name.
An interesting shop to check out herbal remedies for all sorts of things.
Check it out after having a slicw of pie.

Was in the area because I got suckered into stopping for some pie, those dang signs!!!
And was walking towards the gas station and saw Herbs & More, now I love Herb shops,  they are quite interesting for me, it amazes me on how herbs can be used for natural cures.
The real reason why I stopped in was for the & More, I was looking crystals, sometimes they are sold were herbs are at and I wanted to check out what they had.
Unfortunately I didn't find any, but the store does have a lot of offer, I did see a lot of herbs, even have dragons blood, if you are looking to cook up a love spell, dragon blood I heard is helpful haha.
It was a nice shop full of helpful information and I'm sure if you came in with a real need the sales lady would be more than helpful for finding what you seek.

Stopped in here on the way out of town and picked up some sage sprays and herbal remedies.
A nice store with quite a few things to check out.
Definitely worth a walk through.
