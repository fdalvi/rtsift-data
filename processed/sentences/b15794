Just bought some clip ons for my silhouette frames.
The lame plastic clips sold by silhouette go for $70-80 online (probably more at my expensive optometrist).
The young woman at the kiosk was outstanding...give her a raise (it was Sunday morning, 6/29).
In half an hour she made a pair that fit perfectly and are far superior to the original silhouettes...for just $50.
