New office, looks great!

What a friendly staff!
The office just recently opened, and I now know where I'll be taking my kids for their 6 month check-ups!!
They treated me so kindly, and were fast/efficient.
Plus my kids loved the movies/video games/play room while I was filling out the paperwork.
I seriously love this place!

Fantastic office and amazing staff!
Office just opened.
Tvs, video games and play place in the lobby.
Office is clean and organized and the Doctors are incredible!
We'll be back for all of our appointments.
