Always a nice display of seasonal plants on offer.

This place is awesome.
I have NEVER seen a garden center this large, and I'm from the land of large things.
I recently became a homeowner with a bigass garden.
This baby's huge.
In that garden lives a greenhouse.
In that greenhouse lives about 30 tomato plants, four cucumber plants, two strawberry, and various herbs.
I'm not taking the gardening thing lightly, clearly.
I got everything I needed for my garden here.
The staff were helpful and chatty, and their pricing holds up to the exacting standards of my retired accountant father in law, which is saying a LOT.
They have a garden club for £10 where you get a £5 discount card and then 10% off all plant purchases, as well as vouchers for their cafe.
I'm not sure if it would be useful for me beyond this year when I'm starting up, but 10% can go a long way when you are building a garden from scratch.
So, I'm thrilled to have this place 'round the corner from my house and I'll be visiting as often as The Man allows me to run away from steaming wallpaper.
Plus, there are highland coos who live down the way from the garden center, which makes it even cooler.

This is quite a decent sized garden centre with a good range of plants, pots and other garden related items.
It also has a cafe, that I've not tried yet.
I like coming here as the range is quite big and is well laid out.
Definately a good start to get that garden sorted and planted with lots of colour!
