Locally owned and operated, casual dining restaurant that is great for a business lunch or a family dinner.
Awesome fresh, fast power lunches!

Very classy, great food, friendly service.
Attentive and great prices...

Traveling on business and staying at the hotel.
I had the special, which was a filet with an over easy egg in top .
I loved it!!!
Service was prompt.
I'd come back again to explore the menu.
Everything looks really good!

Food was great however the service wasn't good at all.
I had to ask for the bread and dip, we had to ask for refills on our drinks.
And Our bill was incorrect.
Wasn't very impressed with our server.

The food at Benvenuto's is wonderful...I especially like the minestrone soup.
Service is generally fast and friendly as well.
The only frustrating part is sometimes they say they will deliver to my house, but then other times I call for a delivery and they won't deliver to my area.
Very odd and frustrating.
The times we have gotten delivery things were incorrect or missing so I suppose either way it is better to just go in and eat.

Last time I was here I asked for my ribeye steak medium- well.
it was overly well done and dry (fail).
Last night, I asked for my ribeye steak medium-well.
Again, it was overly well done and dry (fail again).
Tonight I call them for room service from the adjoining hotel.
This time I order the "Ranch Hand Ribeye" (per the menu - smothered with chipotle sauce, mozzarella cheese and onion straws).
I ask for it done medium this time.
So, up comes the order missing the soup and the bread that I ordered and zero toppings on the steak.
I call down and they send up the soup and bread but spin me a tale about the steak and the computer and  how it should have cost me $3.00 more because I didn't get the toppings that I ordered (what!?).
Steak actually was medium-well cooked this time, so I let it go but all in all I'm not impressed.
