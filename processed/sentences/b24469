great place, everyone is friendly.
best part is the nursery/kids club area.
My kids love this, as well as the wife and I!
we drop them off for up to 1 hr...talk about stress free grocery shopping.
the location is in a very pleasant neighborhood

Not the smartest people and nowhere near the lowest prices.
The only good thing about this Bashar is that it is convenient when I am in the neighborhood to get my hair cut at the Great Clips (which is the best one in Gilbert).
