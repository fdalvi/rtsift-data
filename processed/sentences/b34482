This place has really nice coral and has the best prices of all the aquarium stores I been to in az.

This is a small, privately owned shop that is unique for a few reasons.
First, you get great customer service from Carlos the owner and his assistants.
They take the time to educate you about saltwater aquariums and the livestock.
They are truly passionate about responsible ownership of these animals.
Also, he will test your water for free and tell you how to correct your water issues.
Secondly, the coral frag selection is HUGE and is very competitively priced.
This allows you to try a few different coral types for $5-25 each and grow them yourself.
Then, when the coral grow too big for your tank or mini-cube as I have, you can take them back and Carlos will frag them for you and pay you for it or trade you for new coral!
Basically, this is the place to go if you want to talk shop with Carlos and his crew in a laid-back home feel, or if you are new to saltwater aquariums and are a bit intimidated by it all.
There are a lot of regulars and people who are friends there.
About the fish selection- it's pretty small, but there are a few of the standards like clown fish, wrasse, firefish etc.

Great staff and reasonably priced corals.
The staff will really take the time with you to problem solve with you and help identify any areas to improve.
