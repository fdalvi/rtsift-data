Mmm, steamy!
I had never tried Firehouse Subs but I had heard plenty of good things about their sandwiches...
So when a location opened up fairly close to my work I decided to give them a shot.
When I walked in, every employee looked up and welcomed me.
I let the cashier know I had never been into a Firehouse, and she quickly went over the menu options and let me know that Firehouse steams all of the meats and cheese unless requested.
There are two sizes available, 8" and 12".
I had the 8" Turkey Bacon Ranch, no onion, and steamed of course!
My sandwich was ready to take back to work about 5 minutes later, and it came with a dill pickle on the side.
The sub was slightly messy due to the peppercorn ranch dressing, but not too messy.. Next time I may ask them to go easy on the dressing.
The ingredients were really flavorful, you can tell the meats used are of better quality then some other sandwich shops around town.
I will definitely be back to try some of the other subs in the future.
Bonus: Come in on your birthday with a valid id, and get a free medium sub FREE!

I've heard a lot of hype about this place so I had to try it out.
It definitely lived up to it.
Sandwiches were very tasty and the homemade spicy bbq sauce was delicious.
I overheard someone in line call this place "a trip".
I'm not sure what that means, but it certainly was a lot more interesting then other sub shops in town.

So excited they opened up a Firehouse in our  'hood.
I got a Club on a Sub and didn't think this sandwich was as good as other subs I've eaten at the S. Eastern shop.
Kind of bland, not much going on.
My dill on the side looked a bit mangled as well.
I know I'm nit picking.
So I'm not sure if it was the sub I ordered or the location, but I will give this Firehouse another try and update accordingly.
The place was clean.
The staff friendly.
Love the "fancy" soda dispenser, with tons of options.

FREE sandwich on your birthday.
Just show your ID.
That's how I got hooked.
I was on a mission back in December to get as much free stuff for my birthday.
Since then I've been back many times since.
Their subs are delicious and staff is friendly.
I've tried a couple different subs but my personal favorite is the Hook and Ladder.
Sweet honey ham and turkey.
They have a wheat bread option and I like it 'fully involved.
' If you don't like the regular chips they also have brownies and cookies with no up charge.
As part of their charity they sell pickle buckets for $2.
Just a side note that's cheaper than a Home Depot bucket.
The best part Firehouse subs soda fountain.
120 drink options.
which includes diet vanilla coke.
I don't know of any other place that offers this.
Even though there are closer sub and sandwich shops where I live, Firehouse subs is worth the drive.

So this time the food was much better but staffing was sub par.
Sunday night, there seemed to be a lot of employees but only one was making subs so the wait was a bit longer than expected.
Maybe he lost a bet or something but why do the customers have to pay the bookie?
Yum!
to the Firehouse Hero though.

The Subs here are Fantastic.
The Coke machine is unbelievable, I don't think I will ever go back to Subway again.
The prices may be a dollar higher.
But it is well worth it.
Clean Bright, Friendly.

Looking for a quick bite near home, I finally had the chance to try Firehouse Subs.
I've heard about them for a while and since I'm always looking for good sandwich options in town, I thought I'd give them a try.
Their menu is anything but extensive.
They have about 10 different sandwich options, but they all sounded pretty good so we were quick to order.
I got the Engineer which was great with the addition of mushrooms.
Considering the prices, you get a huge footlong sandwich for the price.
On top of that, the soda dispenser is amazing.
So many different varieties and mixtures to choose from.
You can get pretty much any soda you can think of and you have the option of adding flavoring as well.
It took me forever to pick my poison.
Service was good, the location is enormous and is clean, which is important.
When I got my food home, I was a little turned off by how soggy the sandwich was.
I'm not a fan of soggy bread typically.
My fella's wheat bread definitely held up better than the white I ordered, so I'll probably order wheat next time.
Despite the soggy texture, the flavors were fantastic.
A little bit too much meat for my taste, but I think I'm a bit odd in the respect of preferring my sandwich not as meaty.
The sandwich was melty and extremely tasty.
I'll definitely be back.
So happy to have a good sandwich option near home, since I don't like Quizno's, Port of Subs or Capriotti's.

The soda fountain is so 21st century.
A touch screen and a bajillion options for your soda.
I review this first because it's the first thing you encounter when you walk into the place.
The service is fast, the staff is ok (I think the girl at the register was having a bad day because she just seemed 'over it'), and the food is tasty-tasty.
I had the 'engineer sandwich' which consisted of turkey, swiss, and mushrooms (nom nom nom), and the combo came with chips and a pickle spear.
I took it to-go as I wasn't about to hang out in a lobby full of rambunctious kids (all the more to you parents and kids, but it was too loud for me).
It's frequented by law enforcement too, as while I was there, I saw LVMPD and NHP vehicles in the parking lot and some officers chowing down.
Infinitely better than Subway or Quiznos.
Mmhmm.

OH MY GOD can these people make a sandwich.
I was at a tournament in Las Vegas and my teammates and I desperately needed food.
I found this place with my phone and I am so glad we went here!
The Sweet and Spicy Meatball sub is absolute heaven.
I also tried some sort of chicken sub and substituted the mayo for honey mustard - it was amazing.
Yes, we went to this place twice in one weekend.
There is also a great soda machine here with over 100 flavors to choose from.
If you like your food on the spicier side, there are a number of hot sauces at the end of the counter that are rated 1-10+++ on the hotness scale.
The establishment itself is very clean, and very much like one would imagine a firehouse back in the day (minus one of those awesome poles).
The staff were all very friendly and seemed really amused at how excited I was about their food.
If I could, I would eat there all the time.
Firehouse Subs, please make your way down to Southern CA!

Great place to have a tasty sub!
Firehouse theme going on with a friendly staff.I support local spots that help the community.
They keep everything steamed so you know its hot and fresh when you bite into it.
Props for the fountain drink coke machine, 120 + flavors.
Average prices & well worth it.

Love this place.
I think I have been to each one in town and waiting for one to open on the Strip.
Tried them a while back just for a change of pace.
Fell in love on first bite with the friendliest staff, open and well lite stores and great meats on a tasty bun.
My favorite is the Italian, but each other one is almost as delicious.
They use real wheat bread, like you can taste the wheat... its that fresh and delicious..

The food is great, esp.
the Hawaiian pulled pork.
Amazing.
What wasn't so amazing was the crew on July 4 - from incompetance at the register to the whole staff seemingly in a sour mood.
The vibe was pretty cold.
Could cut it with a knife -  noticed immediately upon walking in the door.
The Firehouse out on Smoke Ranch Road was fun, lively, and the manager was talking to everyone, very different from the So.
Rainbow shop.
Net: Food good, employees - not so much.

Have been here several times now and love the food.
Just tried the Hawaiian pulled pork and added some spice to it from the amazing selection of hot sauces they have out for use by customers.
Very filling and getting to choose a drink from their soda machine (especially diet) made it a very nice lunch....

Great subs.
Very tasty

Went here when my dad was visiting from Nebraska on a recommendation and wow, we were both amazed at how good the subs are.
They are so much tastier than most other subs we have had and the soda machine was awesome..will be back

Best subs in the entire world.
I dare you to find a better sandwich shop.
Well worth the price.

I'm a junk food, fast food junkie.
I admit that.
I was a subway whore for many years.
I don't like my sub toasted, fried or whatever.
Just good bread, good fixings and fast service...  Than a friend took me to a  FireHouse and its been love ever since.
I will drive past the other place, if there is a FH close by...   First -  its not some tiny little storefront with some snot nosed kid behind the counter, waiting to make some sandwich than ring you up...  Nooo..
There is a line of people waiting to get working on making what you ordered.
friendly, smiling and knowledgeable people...   yes, I said smiling people who know what they are doing... Amazing, but true...
I usually go for the Italian, but will settle for an engineer if pressed.
Haven't had a bad sandwich no matter what I have ordered...    All the meat is fresh and steamed.
I didn't know steamed was this tasty!
The soda machine is soo cool, but they need two in each store because people get overwhelmed at the selections that they see to freeze in front of it and takes awhile to select.
Especially if they never encountered the new mix your own drink machine...

Typically you can't drag me into a sub shop, and I will say the first time at Firehouse, I was like "meh", not much sandwich for a pretty steep price $8-$9 (combo).
I think it was the hot melted that made it go down so fast it wasn't very filling.
Then I had another opportunity to go in and ordered a cold sub, the tuna on white with the fixings.
Quite Nice.
I coupled it with a wonderful combo drink from their nifty beverage machine mentioned by other reviewers, namely 3/4 minute-maid lemonade with 1/4 Minute-maid strawberry lemonade a squeeze of fresh lime and now I am even happier.
Plus bonus, the Cheetos get stashed for a late afternoon snack.
Count me amongst the converted.

I had several people tell me they really love Firehouse subs so I went to check it  out.
The sandwiches my son and I got were decent.
Nothing special, nothing really flavorful, Just OK. As mentioned in other reviews, the moral and employees are just there.
They have zero personality.
I don't care to have any real conversation with the person ringing me up or making my sandwich but when you are trying to be a better alternative than Subway, Port of Subs, Quiznos, try to at least fake that you want to be there.
I liked that they have a big selection of different hot sauces.
That was a plus, too bad I had to add plenty to make my sandwich have more flavor.
I don't drink soda all that often but they have one of those build your own coke machines and that is also a nice addition to Firehouse Subs.
If the sandwiches had better and or more flavor it would help this place stand out more.
With no personality service and just Decent sandwiches, I found it very forgettable and have no desire to try it again.

Pretty good!
i will definitely be back to try the other sandwiches.
good food, reasonable prices.

I had the Firehouse Hero, hot roast beef, turkey and ham.
It really lacked in flavor, just tasted like warm mystery meat.
This is my first time eating at Firehouse and I wasn't impressed.
The meat was piled up in the middle so I opened it up to spread it around and with 3 meats it barely covered the bread.
Expensive for a toasted sub.
Also they made my sandwich on wheat but I asked for white, not a big deal, but when I asked to have it remade they didn't even apologize.
And I had to wait until they finished making the other guests sandwiches.
I won't be coming back, customer service isn't there, no flavor and overpriced.

Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar.
Very good subs and I would recommend this place to anyone.

I've heard a lot about this place.
We walked in, it was very clean, and quiet.
It was 5:51PM when we ordered.
Candace took our order, whom was very nice and attentive to our needs.
She was so nice, it caught me off guard because I'm used to crappy service everywhere we go.
We're from New England originally, I'd been CRAVING a "hot oven grinder" for 2 years.
I got an Italian sandwich it comes with Genoa salami, pepperoni, ham, melted provolone, Italian dressing & seasoning, onions, tomato lettuce, and mustard.
Back east it's pretty much the same way but WITHOUT mustard & they usually throw hot peppers on it.
I wasn't heart broken I never liked hot peppers on my sandwich.
I got an 8" italian sub without mustard or onions on it.
It bought me back home for brief moment.
For $5.79 I couldn't be happier, I was shocked the prices were REASONABLE.
I HATE subway with a passion now that I've come here.
It was just THAT much better.
The combo is 2.29 more with a medium drink & chips.
Now for desert they had COOKIES.
=) Oh yeah, I'm going there.
I had a Chocolate chip cookie, my boyfriend had Oatmeal Raisin.
Both of them were soft,  chewable and delicious.
They're $0.85 for cookies & and they had brownies are $1.29.
The place steams the meats and I gotta say I never thought it'd be so freakin' delicious.
I'm in love with this place.
We'll be back.
I forgot to mention the whole reason we came I saw a picture of the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine that my boyfriend is thoroughly in love with.
I told him they had it, he didn't even give me a chance to look at the menu, he said "LET'S GO!".
Every time we get drinks from a free style machine we do half SPRITE vanilla & half Sprite Strawberry.
Tastes like a strawberry jolly rancher.
=) lol try it.

**Summary**       - Hot subs - Their hot subs are hot from the inside out.
From their heated meats to the melting cheese, they're simply delicious.
- Drink Machine - They have one of those drink machines that let you mix sodas and flavor shots.
It's quite novel if you haven't seen one before.
**Ordered**       - Hook & Ladder - Turkey, ham, and cheese.
This hot sandwich is definitely my favorite.
It has the right combination of salty meats and melty cheese.
- Firehouse Meatball - This is definitley one of the best meatball subs I've had.
- Engineer - Turkey, cheese, and sauteed mushrooms.
Unfortunately, the mushrooms are out of a can and ruined the taste of the sandwich for me.
**Recommendations**       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice quality hot sub.

Better visit 2nd time around.
They're keeping the warm pulled pork/coleslaw sammie, now (was limited time).
That's worth stopping in for, just that one!
They've perfected it.
The semi-sweet Hawaiian bun seals the deal.
Yummay!

The cherry limeade is awesome.
And as far as the sandwiches go, I've yet to try a bad one here.
I don't know that I can say that about any other sandwich chain.
As a chain started by firemen, hot sauce is supposedly a running theme here.
Over on the side is a case of various hot sauces from around the world.
Some of the hot sauces are delicious, some are off putting, but I really don't know that the hot sauce adds anything to their sandwiches.
To each their own I guess, but it's safe to say you won't be disappointed by Firehouse Subs.
Be sure to put it into your rotation of places like Subway or Quiznos.

It was my first visit too Firehouse Subs someplace that been on my radar for sometime.
I got the extra incentive when my roommate raved about the beef brisket and cheddar sub.
I always perceive this place as Quinzos sub.
Talk about SO much better!
The menu is not that big or diverse but can appreciate any restaurant focus on one thing and does it well!
In this case Hot Subs!
I ended up getting the beef brisket and cheddar sub.
Ironic?
It was great choice!
I felt the thinly deli cut slices of beef brisket had amazing flavor combine with melted cheddar cheese.
Awesome.
Even the deli pickle that comes with any sub had nice crunch and really good.
They do have other things on menu besides subs chili or pickles chip, etc.
I enjoyed the decor everything is theme too fire house station.
The moment walked in the entire staff was extremely friendly with welcome too Firehouse Subs.
The soda machine admit that its pretty cool!
Or where else do you find big red machine that dispensing all choices from one press of button?
On the devil advocate if busy probably not the something too look forward too.
The have hot sauce area another thing pretty cool about Firehouse Subs.
Over 30 different bottles that you can use if kick up sub a notch.
They had lot of people on staff so got my sandwich pretty quick.
The combo its great deal for quick lunch.
Sure be back too try more Hot Subs!!

Who knew they smoked their own brisket here, and for 10+ hours?
Not me.
If I'd known that I would have asked the hub to get me a sub, instead of a chicken salad salad, which was fine and homeade....
BUT the brisket, well, he was raving.
Even so, he let me have a bite and I had to agree it was great.
I gave 5 stars for the sub, and 3 for the salad...so if you are getting subs it is really 5 stars all the way.
He ordered the Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar Brisket Sub.
It came with tasty bbq sauce on it and very fresh bread.
Now the dude wants to buy a franchise.

Subs are good, I like them better than Subway or Quiznos.
This one in particular is pretty busy and I love the flavor mix soda machine.

love the soda fountain.
This is my favorite sandwich place, food is always fresh and the selection of sauces is awesome.

We really like the sandwiches and the snappy sauce they have to go with them.
I think the prices are a little high for what you're getting but it's a national chain and that won't change.
You need an engineering degree from MIT for the fountain machine :)

Best subs ever!
My husband loves firehouse as well (he is usually picky when it comes to subs) My fav is the club :) yummzyyyy

Went there for the first time this weekend.
Amazing sandwhich place.
As soon as you walk in they greet u, Everyone that works there are very nice.
Definitely better than Subway.

Great sandwhiches, A little expensive but at least you know you are getting a great tasting meal!

My favorite sandwich shop!
My favorite sandwich is the smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket.
I like their different selection of hot sauces and bowl of chili is excellent!

This place is so fire!!!
Every time they nail it  with there hot subs I just love all the different kind of sauce  you get to pick out.

If u are in the mood for a good hot sub with all the cool hot sauces, this is the place.
the fountain drinks section is awesome.Lots of variety of soda too.

A little surprised..
Lunch on a Saturday and everyone that works here looks like they are hung over.
Giving food to the wrong people and not making food at all...  Great food and nice place but I will steer clear of this place for my good at catering needs...

I came across this place after a meeting and it was an amazing decision!
Not only was the sandwich delicious, the huge variety of sauces were just about the best thing ever.
Friendly staff and minimal wait time.
All together a great experience :)

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!
The OWNER, as she wanted everyone to know, has the attitude that will keep me from entering any Firehouse Sub location again.
Worst attitude and customer service anywhere!
The chip on your shoulder hopefully gets knocked off HARD!
YOU MAKE SANDWICHES, YOU'RE NOBODY!

The subs here are delicious.
They have a wide variety to choose from.
Its a great spot to stop by and grab a quick sub for lunch.

Very good food a bit on the pricey side and they could beefing up the sandwiches more but never the less a great sandwich.
Would recommend

Dear Engineer sub,  How and why are you so delicious?
With your freshly steamed bun, gooey cheese, crisp veggies, tender turkey meat, all topped with perfectly sautéed mushrooms...
It's not even fair for the competition.
Subway, port of subs, Quiznos and earl of sandwiches, you are all in trouble.

I can't help but love the brisket and cheddar sandwich.
I adore that these stores has  those fancy multiple choice soda machines.
They also have a full bar of hot sauces, which I've never used, but, darnit I have the option.
I'm a Port O' Subs person at heart, but I have absolutely fallen in love with Firehouse Subs.

Great place for a sandwich.
Consistent food and friendly employees.
I love how they steam the sandwich to warm the meat and cheese.
Coke machine has so many options!

I am new to Firehouse Subs and I can say I'll be going back there a lot for sure.
Nice to have a hot sauce collection (won't find that at Subway or Quiznos).
Also a nice touch having some flat screens for my viewing pleasure.
Reminds me of hero places on the east coast.

You have to eat the sub at the store or it gets soggy.
They steam it and they are good sandwiches, but the longer they sit the soggier it gets!
They have a good variety of sandwiches.
They are definitely NOT on the health diet.

I have been to this particular location several times enough to know that the owner of the store was sitting in the lobby and greeted me.
Everything was fine until I returned from lunch and notice that my tuna sandwich was toasted.
I explained my situation several times until the owners wife got on the phone.
I was very frustrated at the time, because I explained to them that I have been asked before if I would like my sandwich toasted.
The owner's wife mention that none of her cashiers would ask that question.
So as customer in my opinion the owner's wife did not think maybe it has happen or maybe this customer has had other orders with the purchases before or this is not a first time customer of our store to notice who is the owner.
I enjoy the tuna from Firehouse Subs, but I will never frequent that store again, and will let co workers also know about the experience.
As a store owner take some responsibility that it is possible this has happen when she has not been the store.
The overall experience was great until I had to call about my toasted sandwich.
I have never had an issue with any previous orders from this location.
The subs are good, but the owner's wife is why they receive 1 star.

SUPERB ALL AROUND!!!
I'm rarely one to take time from my day to write reviews, and NEVER write bad ones unless they negatively impact my life.
Life is too filled with more important things, I say...
BUT I truly believe in saying thanks, and sharing kind thoughts where they are due.
THANK YOU!
The pleasure I consistently enjoy from the quality of these sandwiches is top notch.
More importantly, to me, a consistent level of cleanliness and sincere welcoming kindness from staff keeps me going there.
I met the owners as well, and appreciate their care in making sure their customers are happy.
I'm one and hope others appreciate what I do.
Again, THANK YOU!!

Love the sandwiches.
Roommate introduce me this place and now I am addicted.
I really enjoy there hot sauce selection.
I recommend backdraft, it's a 7, feels like a 9.

Great sub sandwiches.
I gotta say i honestly wasnt impressed by their famous meatball sub.
But I cannot get enough of their bbq brisket sandwich.
With bacon.
Sooooo goood!
This location gets pretty busy during lunch hour.
Call ahead if u in a rush.
Great food great service.
Oh and they have those fointain drink machines that make like hundreds of soft drink combinations, love those machines, i make my fav cherry vanilla coke, they need em in every restaurant!

Who doesn't like a sub stacked high with meat, toasted to add a little crunch and mayo or mustard to taste?
A great place for lunch or dinner or whatever.
The one recommendation I would have is to eat it there.
Trying to take a toasted sub home never works out as great as you think it will.

First time here with the family ordered the steamer and the hero and was not disappointed at all.
Very generous portion for the meats and very tasty.
Staff is also very friendly.
Definitely adding this place on my go to places.
