I'm so glad I found Dr. Bakir and Excel Chiropractic.
Yesterday, I had pain in my lower back so bad I found it hard to walk.
I went to my doctor who wanted to put me on physical therapy and pain killers for a few weeks.
After a trip to Dr. Bakir, 90% of the pain was gone and I was back at work the next day.
I've been to other chiropractors who seem to force the manipulations.
With Dr. Bakir, it seemed more relaxed and natural - I didn't really flinch at all.
I can't recommend him enough.

Rich is the best traditional chiropractor in town.
He's a pretty stand up guy too.
I've been to about 6 different chiropractors in  my life and he has helped me the most.

I have had back problems for most of my adult life.
Rich is the only Chiro i have found who actually HELPS my pain and doesn't increase it .
He is a normal drop table chiro and very friendly.
If you are a cash patient ( like me ) he is extremly reasonable.
He is a crackup and always makes my wife and i smile.
Love it here!

I cannot say enough wonderful things about this office!
+2 stars - super friendly office manager - they could fit me in straight away; told me the cost up front and was super apologetic that I was out of network.
+3 stars - TRADITIONAL chiropractic.
I am not sure when it happened but most chiropractors sell products/supplements/magic potions and that is NOT what I want from a chiropractor.
I need you to align things and put me back together.
And then some additional stars:  +1 star - Rich has a very quirky sense of humor.
+1 star - all the other patients appear to be very pleased.

Rich is a life saver!!
Best chiropractor ever.
I've been struck in my vehicle 5x and I couldn't live without him!
