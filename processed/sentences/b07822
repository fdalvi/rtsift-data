Horrible experience !!!!!!
Noooo exaggeration !!!!!!
The service was pathetic and food was ok .
My server came twice around and was rude , the first to get my order and drink and then to be obnoxious .
I went alone and wasnt expecting my boyfriend to show up but he did so instead of the server asking if he wanted something to drink she said " when did you get here ?
" That was RUDE!!
And she still didnt bother to offer him a drink or something to eat .
And to top it off she over- charged me for fries when i didnt even order fries to begin with .
Im usually a GREAT tipper but this was such a bad experience i stiffed her .
She didnt even deserve a penny .
I will NEVER go to this location ever again .

I know it is  Denny's but still.
Come on Denny you have competition for good cheap breakfasts nowadays.
You used to have a reasonable priced, okay breakfast.
What happened?
I ate here on 6/4/13 and the coffee was cold, the eggs were ice cold and runny, the English Muffin was raw, not toasted at all and the fruit was actually spoiled.
(brown bananas and sour, pruny, moldy grapes, WTH?
) The bill was 10 dollars and change.
OH MY!
The server was nice but overworked.
This is not the first time this location has had problems.
We used to go here for our welcome back breakfast at school.
It was bad.
One time it took 1 hour to get my food and I got sick later on.
YIKES.

I like the wait staff but the burger was too sawgy with so much grease other than that awesome

Horrible greasy food.
Gm didn't care at all when we complained.
Management reflects overall very poor experience.
My tummy still hurts!
