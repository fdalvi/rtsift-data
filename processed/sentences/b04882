This is where I bought my wife's wedding and engagement rings.
They came with lifetime warranties and lifetime cleaning and re-dipping for free at any Kay Jewelers nationwide.
Also where I got my un-scratch-able tungsten wedding band.
The people in all 3 of the shops I've been in are really nice.

We always get such great service when we come here.
From taking our jewelry in for inspections when needed to purchasing new items or sending out items for sizing or fixing they have always been nice, reasonably priced and prompt.
They even have a thing where you can always trade up on your diamonds.
May do that in the future with my Blue diamond earrings :) We will be back

I am a member of the united states armed forces and I went to Kay for the best quality service and rings.
I purchased an engagement ring for my girlfriend and when it arrived it came with very noticeable knicks and scratches on the middle (main) diamond.
I took the ring back to the store and the dealer stated to me that its not his problem and all diamonds are imperfect and i would have to deal with it.
He then stated that if i wanted a better diamond i would have to spend an additional 3 to 4 thousand dollars on top of the 4 thousand that i had already spent on the ring.
After stating this he said if i did spend the additional money it would be a perfect cut diamond, even though he had previously stated there are no perfect diamonds.
I am quite disappointed in the customer service and the quality of work from such a prestigious company.
I would not ever dream of spending my money at any Kay establishment in the future.
I would also recommend that everyone else stay far away from  Kay and their obvious lack of caring staff and low quality workmanship.
I should have went to Jared......
Sincerely,  A disappointed customer
