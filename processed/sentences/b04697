I will pass other gas station/c-stores to go to a quiktrip.
Doesn't matter what location i go too, the employees are always pleasant to deal with.
I like that all the QT's are organized in the same manner and are clean.
If there is a line at the register, it doesn't last for long because the employees can take care of two customers at once and they also don't hesitate to stop what they are doing to take care of the customer.

The best gas station and convienence store I have ever seen.
More than a convienence store; this QT is an indulgence stop.
Hot fresh pretzels to order, fast service, 50 different icy or smoothie flavors, tea station, and any snack you think your stomach can handle.
This place is crazy.
I wish they were in Michigan.

Probably the fastest, quickest, niciest bathrooms, cheapest gas station in the state of Arizona.
