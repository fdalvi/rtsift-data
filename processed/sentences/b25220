I had a mailbox here for about a year, and had a great experience.
Since I came in several times a week, I got to know the staff and they were quite helpful.
Living in Anthem, you can feel really far away from everything, but this store had shipping services, US Postal Services (though they charge a bit extra).
They have notary services as well and everyone on staff is knowledgeable and friendly.
A great thing about this location is that with your special key, you can get in to your mailbox even when they are closed.
Also, the location can't be beat--you can hit the UPS store, grocery store, grab a Starbucks, some sushi or mexican food or pizza, get your dry cleaning, even get a massage--all in one trip!

Above and beyond best service on the planet

This is a well run location of the UPS Store.
They are always extremely helpful whenever I come in.
Typically I am there to drop off my Amazon returns; I'm sure they make no money off of offering this service.
However, they still always smile, take my return, and offer me a receipt for proof of drop off.
I rarely need them for anything else, but if I did need them for any of the services they offer then they would be my first choice.
