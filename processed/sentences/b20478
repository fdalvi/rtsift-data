Woah woah woah!
Scotmid had a refurb!
This alarmed me enough to tweet about, which either proves how often I go to this Scotmid or how sad I am, feel free to make your mind up (both).
Gone is the cheery blue, and in is a Co-op esque black and green colour scheme.
In too, however, is a faux-country shop style interior with handwritten suggestions on blackboards and signs designed to look like handwritten suggestions on blackboards.
The shelves and units have been replaced by wire ones too, more basketty looking.
The food of course is still the same, as are the prices, and I'm having to get used to things being in slightly different areas (why have the crisps moved from besides the juice to next to the household items?
), but I'm sure in time it'll become second nature.
There's also a new fresh bakery counter from 'Stuart's' with lots of cakes and pies to choose from (although these aren't particularly cheap).
Honestly I'd rather give Scotmid a 3.5 than 4, but 3 felt too mean.
Refurb aside it's still a good local supermarket, and for as long as I live in the area I'll be in here all the time.

An amazing grocery store, especially for one with such limited space.
In a nutshell, it has basically everything you'd want.
Fresh fruit, veg and baked goods up front and tons of prepared meals and desserts on the side.
Plenty of juice and yogurt options, and a fair amount of dried goods as well.
What's better, they have tuna in SUNFLOWER OIL.
For those who don't know, this is the Holy Grail of canned tuna.
It's so amazing it can't be put into words.
And Scotmid has it, in 4-packs no less, for a measly 3.79 pounds.
