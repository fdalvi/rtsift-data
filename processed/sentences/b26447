My monthly rate is very affordable and the service is excellent.
I love this company.
Check them out they are next to the Marketon Grocery Store.

One star for the affordable plans, but that's it.
As long as you don't need their help everything is fine.
I had an accident and even though I had full coverage they didn't repaired the car.
It was very difficult to get in touch with the person responsible for my claim.
It took more than a month to receive an answer about my case.
According to them my car was damaged before the accident.
The mechanic who was contracted by the insurance said that they always had problem with Nevada Direct Insurance because they never want it to pay.
You get what you pay for.

My experience with Nevada Direct was completely satisfying.
I am not insured by Nevada Direct but was hit by someone who was.
She backed into my vehicle.
Because the damage to my car ($986) was less than my deductible ($1000) I had to collect the damages directly from Nevada Direct.
I called them with the accident particulars and I had a check in my hand for the entire amount nine days later.
Excellent service!
