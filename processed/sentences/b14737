Top notch all the way!!!
We have had several events here now and everytime it is clean and set up exactly  as requested!
The staff is awesome and friendly and makes sure we are always taken care of.
We will be renting the facilities here again several times in the future as so far, thay have been exceptional in all they do.

Great place for the scrap bookers convention, I can't wait until next year

A low-end convention center.
I guess it's probably cheap for them to rent it.
Just kind of dingy all around.
It does the job, but not if you're holding any sort of high-end event.

Attended a gun show that was hosted here a few weeks ago.
The gun show was cool, but the convention center is less than stellar.
Bottom line....it's old, dirty, and tiny.
Add to that, parking is not convenient....the gun show attracts a lot of people and parking was scarce.
If you fell asleep in the 1970's and woke up today, you wouldn't know the difference if you were in this place.
I wouldn't stage events here and would only come back so I can attend a show like this.
