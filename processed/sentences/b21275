I was excited when I found out there was a French bakery in Fountain Hills.
While working there the other day, I stopped by to pick up a few pastries.
I was pretty disappointed in the croissants and chocolate croissants.
They tasted like what you'd get from Safeway.
These were not as flakey and yeasty tasting as the good croissants I've eaten.
I've made them myself and expected these to be at least as good as my amateur attempts.
Not so.
I would call the pastries "OK" and would consider going again to try the bread.

A tasty treat hidden in a strip mall off of Palisades.
Fresh, authentic French bakery--only one in FH!
(I'm glad it's good)

These are definitely better than Safeway croissants.
The pain au chocolat I had wasn't flaky, but it was still pleasant, right balance of chocolate to pastry.
I'd probably give it 3.5 stars if I could.
Nice variety of filled croissants, nice presentation of their baked goods.

My heart still weeps when I drive past La Tartine and know it's no longer there!
I'll admit, I didn't partake of the "caf√©" side of the store - I was strictly a boulangerie-patisserie patron!
I loved knowing I was less than 5 minutes away from that-morning baked epis and real crusty baguettes!
And I was probably the chief reason why the canneles would sell out so fast!
And this past Christmas, I was buche-de-noel-less!
:-(  I also loved the occasional opportunity (usually during the winter) when someone from Montreal or elsewhere would come in and have a conversation en francais with Catherine and Yves.
I've long lost my fluency, but it still sounded so beautiful and home-like to my ears!
I don't know whether they ever check in on their old business - but I wish both Catherine and Yves the warmest of best wishes on their new venture in Las Vegas!
I wish we could have given you enough business to keep you in town!
You're missed!!
