My friend and I tag team car washes here frequently.
It is self-service and only a dollar for 3 minutes.
You can do a whole car in 6 minutes...sparkling in 9 minutes.
We always work it with one person washing while the other one wipes things down with a rag/towel.
They actually have different fluids for the settings (I think there is about 8 different settings).
Wash Around the Clock also has vacuums that do shampooing as well, although some are better than others.
There is a drive through car wash, but I have never used it.
If you don't mind getting a little dirty and putting some elbow grease into washing your own car, for only a few bucks this place is great!!
Not to mention a good half hour work out, depending on how much work you put into it ;)

It's much cleaner than other washes and they keep it up pretty good...I've only once been there and found a machine was broken.
It's pretty cheap.
I put my convertible in the self-service area (ok, actually, I get my husband to do the washing) but we run our other car through the automatic and it does a great job.
The kids love going through and getting sprayed with all the colors, it does a good job, and I don't have to get out and worry about them when they are with me.
Definitely one of the better self-service car washes around.

**BEWARE THIS CAR WASH** I recently visited this car wash and it caused $300.00 of damage to my car through its "touchless wash".
Actually broke my windshield!
I immediately drove my car around the building to show the attendant the damage.
He agreed the vehicle was damaged and stated "it definately could have been done in the wash".
He said i needed to call the owner of the wash to discuss the damage.
I called the "owner" of the car wash "David", which so happens to be the first Yelp comment on here????
Hmmm.
Anyway David was very unprofessional and immediately went on the defense stating there was "no way his car wash could cause damage".
He was very un-pleasent, and un-ruley, and unreasonable to say the very least!
He would not listen to any issues one of "his" customers legitimately had!
Not to mention (that it matters at this point) it was a horrible wash, leaving your car still dirty anyway.. Bottom line folks....
This low-dollar, ghetto car wash will leave you very unsatisfied, and certainly all on your own if you should (god forbid) ever have an issue there!
It cost me a car wash and $300.00 out of my very own pocket to fix his car washes mistake and malfunction!
They take ZERO liability and ZERO responsibility for their own fault even with 100% of fact its their fault.
Their lucky it was only a windshield or else this Yelp comment would have been linked to the civil lawsuit filed!
Think before visiting any of the "Wash Around The Clock Car Washes"!
Save your money and visit a differant wash that actually CARES FOR IT CUSTOMERS!
Thank you for listening folks and God Bless.

Went in yesterday with the kids (they like going thru car washes) and the machine took my money.
Unfortunately, I had put in a large bill.
I couldn't find someone there to help but saw a number on the door.
I called and low and behold, someone actually answered on a weekend.
I geared up for a battle but was pleasantly surprised when the manager told me he'd have someone there in a little bit and I could stop by any time the rest of the day and get my money back and a free wash for the trouble.
Finally a business that treats the customer right!
