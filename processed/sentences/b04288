so I ordered as usual not allot of waiting from order to window...
I get to the window and the employee asks me my order... slightly annoyed I repeat it and he sass..." Your Order Got Deleted"... so I pay the $7.31..
Thinking the entire time.... (being a Ronald McDonald's graduated of 83') Errors like this is an "Automatic Free Meal".. Will have to email Corp office on my "Deleted Order"

New remodel is looking good.
Food is consistent the lot is a little bit harder to get to than some locations.
Decent staff.

So the drive thru avg during rush hour but what pissed me off I get my dollar large tea dude it was all ice.
Come on you guys make too much to cheep me out of 4oz of tea thanks for the ice.
