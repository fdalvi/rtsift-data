Disaster.
This place is a nightmare.
It's relatively new and already doesn't look it.
And, I had one of the worst checkout experiences of my life.
I got in line and the line was long and getting longer.
There were 2 cashiers one of them had a very large transaction so the front end supervisor hopped on.
All of a sudden, one of the cashiers, who was dressed as Bon Qui Qui, stopped ringing and started processing her go-backs IN SLOW MOTION.
She would periodically look up and notice the line getting progressively longer, but continued to move at the pace of molasses in winter.
She has a promising future at the DMV.
After nearly 10 minutes of this the front end supervisor told her that she wasn't supposed to start that until 2:45 (it was now 2:40 and she had been at this for 10 minutes) and that it shouldn't take her more than 5 minutes.
Clearly she hasn't seen her in action.
Or inaction.
The girl acted like this was new information (I doubt it) and went ahead and started ringing.
I swear there was steam coming off the entire line.
It was totally ridiculous.
I will absolutely never shop here again.

I enjoyed this Ross much bigger than the others, and so much selection.
More registers, at first my concern was the wait though they have plenty of registers only had one cashier but in time 2 more showed up so the wait was not to bad.
I think this was a great Ross and I will definitely come back.
Also if you want to get through faster than in the line they do have a rack to put your hangers.
Only thing I didn't like was having to grab my own receipt
