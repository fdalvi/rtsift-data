After reading great things about the workout at Body Lab & seeing that your first class is free, I gave it a try a couple weeks ago.
It's in a great location off Hayden in a strip mall with plenty of parking.
As you walk in there are cubbies for your things & a small retail area.
There are 12 machines total that are spaced out well so you won't hit your neighbor.
The class is 50 minutes & totally different than anything I've tried.
It's similar to being on a reformer but with more capabilities - we did rowing moves, lunges, various arm exercises, planks, etc.
It's pretty easy to follow along but not as easy to do everything that the instructor says - but for every move there is a modified move, so this class truly is for anyone & everyone.
After my first free class I bought a 10 pack since the workout was great & both the instructors and fellow body labers were so nice.
Check it out!

I have bulging discs in my lower back and this workout doesn't usually aggravate them.
Classes are a combination of cardio and strength.
Great workout.
Great location.
It's expensive though and some teachers are definitely better than others.
I always appreciate being corrected on my form, which not everyone does.

Scott's classes are hands down the best!!
The 50 minutes fly right by and the workout is really great!
