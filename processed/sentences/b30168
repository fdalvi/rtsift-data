The decor is mismatched, but the place is comfortable and they have wi- fi.
The food  is delicious from the chips and spicy salsa to the fantastic chicken enchiladas to the yummy machaca chimichangas...if you love a well made margarita, try their Perfect Margarita: Don Julio, Cointreau.
Gran Marnier, triple sec and lime... Hand shaken... the best!

Really good food (and tons of it).
I definitely recommend the chimichangas and all the desserts..
They always seem to be empty, but I assume it's because they're new-ish and kind of far from the regular food places
