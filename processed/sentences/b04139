Ginger & Pete Kuzo are the terrific new owners.
The employees really take care of their customers.
Great service.

I run a small business selling merchandise eBay.
I'm in this place nearly every other day.
It's not the closest shipping site to me but it's the best.
The owners of the ups store also work there.
Can't beat their customer service!!

I'll take my business to FedEx or the USPS after my experiences with UPS stores.
They are expensive, lack decent customer service, manager is rude and micromanages the staff.
Hello, if they can't do the task without your "help" maybe you shouldn't have hired them or maybe you need to alter your training program.
We have gone here merely for the convenience of the location(s) and have had to take business elsewhere for various reasons (purchasing stamps, mailing packages, etc.
) Most recent visit, I arrived with a fax to send but a third customer that came in had hers sent first instead of waiting for mine.Had to wait for transmission receipt before they could send a new fax.
Business where my fax was being sent closed during the wait for the other customers fax and mine never went through.
Thanks for that.
I have got to remember to stop going there.

Spoke with a very nice lady who helped me locate my package- thanks so much for the help :)

Use to own a Business nearby and used them for multiple printing and shipping needs.
Moved about 5 miles away and continue to come back to this location because of the service and attention they give.
