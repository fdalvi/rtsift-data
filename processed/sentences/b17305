Tasty locally owned and operated sub sandwich shop.
Previously an instance of Zero's.

Yes this was a 5 star, but it is closed for ever

I loved Brenda's Subs.
They are now out of business at this location, and I don't think there are any other locations.
They had Philly cheese steak sandwiches and Philly chicken cheese sandwiches that were the best I've even had.
Brenda's Subs, you will be missed.
