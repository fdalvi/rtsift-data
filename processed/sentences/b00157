I'm still not sure which way to pronounce it, but if you want to meet some real-life northsiders- this is a good stop.
And it's not too far away from downtown.
Some people say their bloodies are unstoppable, but I didn't love it.
The decor is definitely influenced by NASCAR and NFL, and they also have a pool table and dart board - with a fireplace.
Probably a great place in the winter

Busse's is very much a typical neighborhood tavern, with cheap drinks (cheapest in the city that I've found) and nice down to earth people.
Recent updates have been made as far as tv's, games, sound system, etc., so if you haven't been in a while to catch a game or hear some music (the old juke box was circa 1970's) you might give it another shot.
If you are into "bomb" shots the Chuck Norris shot is something you need to try.
If you like tap beer the selection is limited, but very inexpensive, and the lines are always clean (hint: the owner drinks tap beer).
Cocktails are stiff, and REALLY inexpensive.
If you're a northsider looking for a new local hangout, or someone heading to a Mallard's game looking for a spot near Warner to hit up before or after the game (they always have Mallard gameday specials) this is the place.
