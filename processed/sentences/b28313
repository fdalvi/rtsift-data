Amazing show!
Just saw it tonight and I as well as the crowd were laughing from start to finish.
Well worth the price.
You also get two free drinks included in the ticket price.

Wow...1 star I have no choice!
Todd Paul needs to scrap this waste of a show and focus on funny!
I expected funny and this was far from it!
Hand me a crate to sit on and a microphone and I will show you funny for free!
Todd Paul...really?

For an hour long show, I think we laughed maybe 3-5 times....Not good.
We found ourselves more than bored 20min into the show....also not good.
We decided to have a few extra drinks, however they ran out of tonic....definitly not good.
As others have said its 3 comedians sitting on crates telling jokes, fake laughing at each others jokes.
I'm not sure why they even bother to call it a "dirty joke" show as most of the jokes were only made dirty with an f-bomb.
To their credit, other people in the audience of about 25 did laugh-sometimes.
Wouldn't reccomend this show.

this show is more of a play than a comedy show, that said dont be scared off from seeing a play.
setup is there are three comics entertaining each other between sets.
sort of a back stage view of what you dont see at a comedy club.
have seen performers at other venues in town, was great.
go in expecting to hear some jokes at a late night show.
the performers are good, the jokes are funny and the venue is smallish (is that a word) and intimate.
for me the show worked.
