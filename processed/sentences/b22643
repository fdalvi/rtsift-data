Bubble wrap?
Boxes?
Mattress bag?
Sure, Public Storage has it all!
Although we never used this business for its storage units, we HAVE been SEVERAL times to purchase moving supplies and have always had awesome service.
In a week we are leaving Arizona behind as we move across the country :( We have both done the cross country move alone but never have we BOTH moved TOGETHER!
It is amazing how much stuff accumulates in just a few short years!
We got on a big kick today and seemed to just blow through boxes and bubble wrap.
We were in 'the zone' and never even looked at the clock when we grabbed the keys to head to Public Storage.
Sadly we pulled up right when the gal was leaving.
When she saw us she said 'ooh sorry, we're closed.
'  With puppy dog eyes we looked at her and said 'all we need is bubble wrap.
'  Then, with a smile she said, 'SURE, come on in!
'  With that, we bought our 2nd box-o-bubble wrap and the packing could continue!
Thank you PUBLIC STORAGE for your awesome service and ability to serve a customer even at the stroke of closing time!
I'm sure we will be back sometime this week!

Great customer service here!
Vicki was great from start to finish, showed us 2 different size units and explained contract thoroughly.
Feel very good about storing our things here.
If you're looking for the right place to store personal belongings, this is the place!
