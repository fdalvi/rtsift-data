Lets face it.
No one wants a Testicular sonogram but if you just gotta have one, this place is great.
Nice office / waiting room.
Very nice staff.
Understanding and aware that some procedures are a little invasive and embarrasing.
They had a high degree of professionalisim and discretion.

Reception is quick and efficient, staff is nice and warm, very welcoming  I have been going to this facility for more than 10 years now and have always admired the way patients are treated.
They know that you are there because you are not well and they are very sympathetic.
Whether you are here for a mammogram, an MRI, ultrasound or CT Scan, your experience is sure to be pleasant...

I went for a CT scan and was treated very professionally and courteously.
They explained each procedure and made sure I was relaxed and comfortable.
They communicated with the doctor to make sure they were getting the scans he wanted.
The technology seems to be very up-to-date.
The place is very clean.
I would recommend.

I love coming to this location.
The yearly mammogram trip is no fun but there is no way around it.
The front desk people are very professional and fast.
I was called to the back and headed to get my test.
After the technician was done, she asked me if I wanted to wait for the results.
I already knew about this service, that is why I chose this location.
Yes,  if you wait 30 minutes in the waiting area they will come back with your results.
If you have to have your tatas squeezed, might as well get the answer fast.
