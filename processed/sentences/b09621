I have been coming to Marks for about 5 years now.
If ever you need a nut or bold these people have it from stainless to metric from great big to tiny.
Just to see what they have is worth the trip to their store.
Price is great.
Most of the nuts and bolts are sold by weight not how many.
I find they are at least 1/2 as expensive as a hardware store.
If you are looking fore something and don't find what you want?
Ask, if they have it they can direct you to the area.

Very friendly and helpful staff, I needed some very small hex tipped bolts that other places told me didn't exist since they didn't carry them, yet I had them in my hand... this is the place for all my nut and bolt needs from now on, awesome prices too...
Thanks so much
