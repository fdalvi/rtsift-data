Great cheeseburger for about $5.
Right next door to Charleston Antiques.

Wow.
Like Tiffany's http://www.yelp.com/biz/tiffanys-las-vegas but without cirque like acrobatics behind the counter and the quick wit of Alice's Flo or urgency of time.
If you're below the age of a social security check recipient, don't expect to be known.
But the place has a Cheer's like atmosphere where everybody knows everyone else's name.
It's a cash only place that serves comfort food and is definitely a regulars hang out.
The people a crazy nice and the food is well, comforting.
Attached is one of my favorite bars Decatur Liquor and you can't beat the price.
It's not 24 hrs but is good stop when you are near.

This place has it all.
Comfort food, prescription drugs, a connected full bar w/ karaoke, and angry old people that had to have come from losing Bingo at Arizona Charlies.
Don't expect a quick lunch because Grandma is your server and doesn't enjoy the hustle and bustle.

This is a great hidden gem.
It is exactly what this town needs...a little mom and pop diner that has all of the old time favorites.
We go there specifically for the grilled cheese and cheeseburger, which are some of the best we've found in town!
My husband and I were both born and raised here, so we've tried it all and Decatur Drug Diner is a great place for lunch and dinner.
We haven't tried breakfast yet, but have heard it is good.
Great for pick up too and they do except credit cards even though the website says they don't.
