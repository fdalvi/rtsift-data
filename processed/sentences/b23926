Excellent shoes, fabulous service!
They really know how to cater to kids and parents, highly recommend this shoe store.

This is a great little store, off the beaten path at the company's head office.
They offer a full selection of pediped shoes.
The gal behind the counter was very knowledgeable and nice.
We bought 4 pairs of shoes and will definitely be coming back.
These shoes are amazing!

This a great place to buy shoes for small children.
It is right next to the distribution center, so they have every shoe/size in existence.
The sales woman was very helpful and explained how the insole system works.
It is a little hard to find, so bring the address and GPS.

Pediped shoes are awesome!
I'm going to be sad when my daughter grows out of them.
I was so excited when they opened the corporate store.
They have a wide selection, which other stores did not.
You can even buy online & pick up in the store

The pediped store is so cute and their shoes are the only thing my son will keep on his feet!

Love this place!!
Wonderful prices, friendly and helpful staff.
So happy I can shop here.

What a horrible place.
Not only is it ridiculous to put shoes on feet that don't walk; they give such a hardcore sells pitch that you feel like you are abusing your child if you don't buy their over-priced baby shoes.
They really do make it sound like your kid will be a limp-cripple if he is denied these shoes.
If there is ever a time in your kids' lives when it is ok to not worry about shoes; it is when they are 2 and under.
