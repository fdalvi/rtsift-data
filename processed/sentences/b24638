Every time I just walk in and never have to wait.
Love this place.
They all do a great job whether on my nails or my feet!

My husband and I and two of our friends recently had a pedicure and I have to say this was the best pedicure I've ever had and the people that work there are fun!
The shop is nice and clean....I will definitely be going back!

Do not go to paulenes nails, unprofessional Dirty, the worst service ever, this place should be closed  I can't believe this place exist in the nails business.
