I needed some new headphones and I know that I have a really good accessory discount at AT&T (not to mention I was getting anxiety from all the Christmas shoppers clogging up the walkways) so I decided to stop in and see what they had.
I wasn't greeted when I walked in and it probably took about 3 minutes before someone checked on me to see if I needed help.
I know I look young, but I don't look like some punk 15 year old who isn't going to buy anything.
I asked about the different kinds of headphones they had and the girl went to go look in a cabinet.
I picked the one I wanted and she took it to the counter to ring it up.
I told her I have an accessory discount so she pulled up my account and said she had to look up the percentage.
I wouldn't think that would take too long but it was taking so long my friend at one point jokingly asked if I was signing a new contract.
When I was finally paid up the girl did walk around the counter to hand me my bag but I don't think she smiled once while she was helping me and she seemed to be somewhere between bored and un-caring.
I will be not be returning to this location if I can avoid it.

I stopped by several times at this store for buying my wife's and sister's phones.
Given stars are all for one of workers there whose name is Jocelyn.
I am a foreigner, and English is not my native language.
Sometimes dealing with sellers is kind of difficult since there are too many details to think about.
I would say Jocelyn is the best person to talk and ask about those details.
Usually I use online shopping like Amazon not to make small mistakes which cause additional costs for next couple years like cell phone contracts, but this is different with her.
I strongly recommend Jocelyn to anybody to purchase cell phones with AT&T.

Their service always fast, talkative, always have a discount on service that match with your need, and I always went home as a happy customer :)
