Best bank I have ever been into.
EVERYONE who works there is ALWAYS so nice.
Free coffee.
Beautiful building.
Plenty of parking.
Great rates.
This is my favorite bank of all time.
I keep reminding myself to switch my other accounts to this bank as well.
I feel like the other banks keep nickel & diming me.
But, not Midfirst.
The staff here has been there for a while and know what they are doing, so they don't sign me up for accounts where I will run into random fees.
I love this place.

5 star service.
Stay away from the Wall Street mega banks and put your money into a community bank like MidFirst.

Best private bank in the state of Arizona.
I used to work across the street from the bank, and I was recently in the area and decided to check this branch out as I believe that this was the 1st MidFirst Bank in Arizona.
I enjoyed their fast and friendly staffs.
In and out of the bank in less than 5 minutes.
They also offer nationwide free ATM service, it's a must if you travel a lot like me.
And they are the home bank for Arizona State University Sun Devils!
