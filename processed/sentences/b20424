lf it's educational books that you are looking for then really this is not the place to come as you're unlikely to have a lot of success due to the fact that this place focuses more on books for the enjoyment they offer rather than for the educational value they offer.
The library is almost entirely devoted to fiction and subdivisions of fiction - even its arts section is mostly comprised of musical autobiographies.
If you do get a reasonable amount of enjoyment out of reading a good book then this certainly isn't a bad place to spend the afternoon especially with its fairly comfortable reading areas.
It is most certainly a library there to entertain.
