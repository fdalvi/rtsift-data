David has been cutting my hair at his shop in Carefree, for well over ten years.
He's a pro; pleasant, meticulous, always reliable.
HIGHLY recommended.

After staying Carefree for the month of April ,2012 I looked for a barber shop and have to say that this is one I would love to bring home to Boston.Dave gave me two cuts in April, he is just  an excellent barber and very reasonably priced.
I usually go to my barber every six weeks or so.But I had to have one to go!!!!!!!
Thank You Dave ,and hope to see you next time I am in town.
Five stars and two thumbs up, Mark

David is a first rate barber!
He and Tanya provide super service and fantastic cuts!
Getting your haircut there is always full of laughter along with a great cut.
I highly recommend you pay Little Barber Shop a haircut.

I am new to the Carefree area and wanted to find a good barber.
I searched on Yelp and found David at the Little Barber Shop.
He is an excellent barber with reasonable rates.
Be sure to call ahead as an appointment is usually needed.

Coming from the midwest I had a great barber and was concerned whether I would ever find one in North Scottsdale but I did!
David does a great job and is reasonably priced.
Takes his time with every cut.
I'm now a regular customer.
