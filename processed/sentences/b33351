Lovely staff, the cashier Yodit was very helpfully store was very clean .
They always have the cheapest gas in town

I like this AM/PM for one reason; Cheap Gas!!
This station, along with the location at Decatur & Washington, always have the lowest priced gas on the westside of town.
It always amazes me that people will stop at the unnamed station a block away and pay 40 cents a gallon more than the same product is sold for at this station.

Wanna get cheap gas?
Come here!
I've always only come here for gas.
Lately its been 3.58$ and everywhere else is 3.80$.
The only crappy part is that if you dont wanna pay cash there is a .35 cent fee for using debit.
But thats better than paying that per gallon.
Its also on the corner acorss from Fantastik so its easy to get in and out.

Good coffee, lots of flavor choices, and creamers.
Usually very clean, cheap gas, lotsa snacks.
I appreciate the diversity in their COLD soda choices.
They seem to keep a lot of choices and replace them as they are bought instead of simply loading 5 choices in the fridge and calling it good.
The ATM at the gas pump almost always works, a rarity at gas pumps in the hot days of summer.
