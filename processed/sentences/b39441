The  food here is delicious and perfectly seasoned.
Lisa & Stephanie look just like their moms & it touched my heart to see the working together.
This is a great place to grab a bite to eat that won't empty your pockets.
The food & service will keep you coming back for more.
Loved, Loved, Loved the chicken waffles & the hush puppies!
If you're looking for real soul food, look no further!

Tucked away in the corner of a very tiny strip mall is this ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS place.
I came in and it was empty,I was the only person here.
The 2 women working behind the counter/kitchen couldn't have been more friendly and welcoming and suggestive when it came to me being indecisive about what I wanted to order.
Food is flavorful,juicy,and just plain ole fashioned home cooked yumminess.
I just wish this place had more visible signage alone the roadside.

Today I had a friend suggest Mother's Wings & Thinks.
The Staff was friendly.
The food was great!
I recommend the Mac & Cheese.
Thank you for a great experience.

Open 7 days a week LIES LIES LIES  I've been calling for the last half hour and it just keeps ringing!!
Maybe because of the Super Bowl ?
C'mon REALLY that's so BS
