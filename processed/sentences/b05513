This Sally beauty supply store is just like all of the others I have been to.
It has a staff of employees that are not really helpful or motivated to assist customers.
I walked in knowing what I needed however had a few questions regarding a certain brand of hair color.
The purple haired lady answered my question with a question then walks away back to stocking shelves.
I bought what I needed without the assistance of said employee and got the hell out of there.
Enough said...

Miserable staff that works there.
No thank yous for shopping at the store.
Will never be back.

I read both the other reviews before i came here and I really should have listened.
This store is in serious need of help !!!!!!!
It was just, wow, looked liked a tornado went through it....merchandise all over the floor to where you couldn't even walk through the already tiny aisles without tripping, stepping on stuff, or leaping to get over it.
Thankfully, my 3 year old son was there cause he cleaned up the aisle and stacked everything nicely so mommy could walk through, though I thought it was sweet and I wish he would do that at home...Its def.
not his job !!!.....
The customer service was just as bad.
Luckily I was in a semi patient mood that day.....I love Sallys but this one ugh pains me to say it....Ill NEVER go back!!
