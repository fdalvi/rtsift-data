They have never once gotten my order right at this KFC.
There is always sauce when I ask for none on a sandwich, the wrong dipping sauce for my strips, etc.
Okay, maybe they did get my order correct once...
But it was awful!
Check out the pictures to see what I'm referring to.

I love kfc's mashed potatoes...
They are just downright glorious.
However, the last two times I've gone to this location, there has been more breading than chicken, the chicken strips have been stale as all get out, and my mashed potatoes were far less than glorious; in fact, they've been down right mediocre at best.
Last night, my roommate and I went to grab some dinner and I could barely eat my chicken strips they were so hard.
My potatoes were cold and the service was just awful.
The service was slow, they got our drinks wrong, and the employees were really rude.
I'm not sure I'll be returning.
