Glad to put this guy on the Yelp map.
This is a cool store.
Only focused on Bass, they are informed and have great products here.
Not sure how they stay in business unless they do mail order, you can walk in here anytime and chat with the dudes behind the counter.
If you're a musician just go in and chat, he'll tell you about the music scene here, what it is and used to be, and will help you out with with anything, even if it's not a bass issue.
Many brands of amps from Hartke to Genz Benz to SWR, etc...
Many Basses from P-bass to Jaguar Bass to electric upright.
Good People.

I bought my first bass, a used Precision, from Lee at the Bass Place in 1995.
I loved this store, and it's a damn shame they've moved.
I'd been to this place countless times over the years, and was never dissapointed.
They always had the parts that I needed, the basses that I wanted, and the answers to my questions.
Bass Place had something for every bassist; from budget basses to high-end and boutique instruments.
Their amp selection was second to none!
Hopefully I will make it out to the West side to visit, but it was great to have them in Tempe for all those years

One of my favorite stores anywhere!!
Dennis and Lee are great guys, very knowledgeable and have always been able to help my needs, whether fixing something, selling top notch equipment at great prices, or just to share bass wisdom.
I recommend The Bass Place as five-stars as good as it gets.....anywhere!
