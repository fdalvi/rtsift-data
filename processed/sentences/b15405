This store no longer exists.
Edit 11/8/10: Changed to 5 stars, Manawerx is under new ownership and is sharing a store for the time being with Imperial Outpost Games in Phoenix.
Rumor is they may occupy the suite next door.
More as it develops.

Ordered online on a Saturday--- Hoping to get cards in by Friday of the following week.
The shop didn't even mail them out until 3 days later on Tuesday.
I can understand Sunday, but Tuesday?
What's the point of charging for special shipping options if you aren't even going to ship next day or in a timely mannor.
Good prices but now I am pretty much screwed for states because my cards won't be in on time.
Don't buy if you want them quickly.
