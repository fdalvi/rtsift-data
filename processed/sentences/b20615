I absolutely adore Karen Millen but if I'm being honest, it's usually just for some window shopping and expect to pay £200+ for a dress from here.
I guess you could see it as an investment as the dresses are all classics and most of them won't date so you'll always have a gorgeous dress on standby.
In addition to dresses they also have shoes, handbags and various other accessories to complete your outfit but these come with a hefty price tag too.
I was ecstatic when I saw that ASOS have started selling Karen Millen but unlike pretty much everyting else they stock these babies rarely find themself in the 70% off section... sadly.
The shop is very organised and everything is just so glamorous, when I get my high flying job (hopefully soon) I will make a trip to Karen Millen with my first pay packet to buy one of the beautiful dresses rather than just drooling over them from afar.
So if you're looking for an extra special dress with the "wow factor" and have a generous budget to spend then march yourself along to Karen Millen!

I totally agree with Eleanor on this one - I absolutely adore Karen Millen but can't exactly afford the £200+ price tags!
Saying that, I bought a drop-dead gorgeous purple dress 2 years ago and I wear it every Christmas and every big event, and it does wonders for my figure.
For those familiar with my reviews, I tend to mention my hips.
But wearing my Karen Millen dress, what hips?
My mum, with a steady pay cheque and a sugar-daddy spends a fortune in this shop.
No wonder, they have high prices, their clothes are amazing.
They always seem to get the trends just right, and they always have a matching pair of shoes and a clutch for every outfit.
If you have an important event coming up, or you just feel like spoiling yourself, hit Karen Millen.
You won't regret it, but your purse might.
Put it on the visa, deal with it next month.
