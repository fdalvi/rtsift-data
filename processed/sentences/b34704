So my wife found Amusing Events online and wanted to provide a singing telegram to surprise me.
It started with dinner at the house with friends and then we got a knock on the door and I figured it was our neighbors coming over for drinks.
I open the door to see a ballon and the curliest locks on a Richard Simmons impersonator.
He came in with a radio which he customized a 5 song routine to all the information my wife supplied him via email.
He was hilarious and never broke character even when throwing one-liners right back at him.
I never got the chance to catch his name, but was very impressed with the service.
As I mentioned the ballon, he also provided a handful of prank gifts that related to the information he received.
Such as weight loss pills, a sparkly jump rope, and dog treats as we just got a new puppy.
My hat's off to you sir for a great routine and making it a memorable birthday.
Based on their website the do comedy roasts, costumes, etc.
So happy to see another great local service.
**After looking at the website his name is Tom LaGravinese**

Thomas is abso-tudi-lutely hilarious.
He accomodates to your honey's schedule, and will surprise them anywhere; whether it is at their workplace or at a house party.
He is very funny, and makes you feel comfortable during his singing telegram.
Not only does he sing telegrams to individuals, but he also does comedy roasts.
He's truly a great find!
