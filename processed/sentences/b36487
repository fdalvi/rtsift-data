This location is  different from other Cleanfreak location.It cost you same as other location but you won't get "Clean" car wash.
Very shot car wash line.No pressure air hose to dry.Avoid this location.

For a quick car wash, I really like this place.
Here's why:  + They still use the scrubbing cloths that spin and actually get stuff off your car.
Most quick car washes nowadays only use the water pressure nozzles, which doesn't clean up the dirt and grime real well.
+ They give you a prewash spray before you enter the car wash.  + It's only $5-$10 (depends on wash selection) and then they give you a 50% OFF coupon for your next wash.
So next wash is $2.50 to $5....pretty cool.
+ It's right off the 101 and Via De Ventura.
Very convenient when driving to/from work.
I can also air dry any leftover drops on the freeway...ha!

I love these guys!
Always so friendly and helpful.
They have a 'wheel wash' that you can do beforehand as well as vacuums.
I do think the driers are better at the other location which is why I didn't give 5 stars.
Still, amazing value for what you get....especially if you buy their half off gift cards at Christmas time.
The perfect stocking stuffer!
Fast, friendly, reasonably priced, convenient....you just lost your excuse to have a dirty car.

The only car wash I will go to.
Extremely friendly service every time.
They are fast,  efficient,  and cheap.
You can't go wrong here with a $3 car wash.

I go with the basic wash for $6.
Gets my car pretty clean.
The vacuums do a great job sucking up the dirt on the floor mats.
I'm in and out in less than five minutes with a clean car!
