I found Northwest driving school online and am glad that I did.
Rich is an excellent instructor and was very patient in helping me learn and get over my fear of driving.
He offered practical advice on improving my driving skills and I would definitely recommend him to anyone who wants to learn how to drive.
Their customer oriented approach sets them apart!

Thanks to Rich, so I got my driver's license today.

A driving school couldn't be better than this one.
They taught my son even though he has learning disabilities.
He is an educated, safe driver now.
They are awesome!
