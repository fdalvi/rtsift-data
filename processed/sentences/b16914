READ MY REVIEW IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING A PURCHASE HERE AT THE BRIGHTON IN CAESARS PALACE.
I walked in here on a hot hot October day, only be to greeted by a sales associate and offered cold bottled water.
COOL!
I feel special already.
I eyed a couple of bags by Bottega only to rule them out because they were EXPENSIVE.
I stumbled upon the Furla area and started to drool.
Quickly decided to rehyrdate my mouth with water from Brighton than saliva.
I picked up this relatively big all leather hobo handbag and frantically searched for a price tag.
There was none.
So I proceeded to the sales associate who had given me water.
Heidi C.: There's no pricetag for this bag, how much is it?
Sales Associate (SA): Oh let me check for you... Heidi C: Okay thanks  **Heidi C. keeps drinking her water while the SA talks to another SA to find out the price of this gorgeous Furla bag**  SA: I'm pulling it up right now.
I believe it's 50% off.
Heidi C.: OH MY GOD REALLY?
Okay...  **Heidi C. noticed the two SAs whispering to eachother about my bag, staring at it, touching it, etc**  SA: It's originally about a thousand dollars, but we discounted it to you for $495 Heidi C.: WOW that is a big discount....so wait, can I know the exact original price?
SA: Let me look...about a thousand Heidi C.: About?
Uh...okay  **Heidi C. spends about 15 mins deciding if she wants the bag, discussing it with my friends**  Heidi C.: I think I'm going to pass...thanks though.
SA: Are you sure?
It's 50% off, $495 is a good deal.
Heidi C.: I know, thanks though.
AND GUESS WHAT?
I DID MY RESEARCH AFTERWARDS AND THAT EXACT FURLA BAG WAS PRICED ORIGINALLY AT $475.
EXCUSE ME?
SO THE DAMN SALES ASSOCIATES AT THIS VERY BRIGHTON WERE TRYING TO RIP ME OFF, BY TELLING ME THE BAG WAS A GRAND WHEN IT REALLY WASN'T, THEN TRYING TO LURE ME TO BUY IT BY TELLING ME THAT IT'S 50% OFF WHEN IT REALLY WASN'T AT ALL.
THEN THEY PROCEED TO TELL ME THAT IT'S $495 WHEN THE ORIGINAL PRICE IS $475.
THAT'S $20 MORE.
WHO DO THEY THINK THEY ARE??
I AM SO TICKED OFF BY THIS BRIGHTON.
IMAGINE HOW MUCH ANGRIER I WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD I PURCHASED THAT FURLA BAG.
IF I COULD BURN THIS BRIGHTON DOWN WITHOUT GETTING IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW, I SOOOO WOULD.
Ladies & gents, do your research next time you go handbag shopping.
I definitely learned from this experience.
F YOU BRIGHTON COLLECTIBLES.

I have to admit, I have visited this store several times before this review.
I was really excited to check it out and to see what my Auntie would get so excited about.
I did like some of their bags.
I love the heart motif.
I like that they have repair warranties and things like that.
Their store is a lil one but it's still got a pretty nice selection.
The one thing that keeps me from purchasing anything from them, at this specific location, is that the sales associates aren't the friendliest.
I'm sure that tons of people go in there just to look.
They probably touch a few things, model them in a mirror and put them back, but not quite as perfectly as they were displayed initially.
I know how upsetting it can be when someone comes and disturbs your display.
But still, put a smile on your face.
Sheesh.
I'm sure it takes little to NO effort to "kill it with kindness".
The sales associates there should try it sometime.
I bet it'd pay off.

YAY!
They have charms for my Brighton bracelet!!
I randomly came across this store and was helped very quickly and they had so many choices.
I wish I had that many choices at my local Brighton store.
