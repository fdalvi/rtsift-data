Woo Hoo!
Little Caesars opens in Fountain Hills!
Yummy pizza.

Not bad.
Not the best but the price is low.

The ONLY place I buy pizza in Fountain Hills!
HOT-n-READY $5.00 pizza or hot wings...

Little Caesars:  "WAIT, IT'S NOT READY!
"  I don't why this particular location NEVER has pizzas ready.
That's the whole point of going to Little Caesars, right?
You go in, give them $5 and walk right back out with a pizza.
It's really not worth waiting for, in my opinion.
