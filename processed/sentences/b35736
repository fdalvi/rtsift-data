Scott the manager is very knowledgable.
Go here its great.
Just bought a house with a pool so this is where I go for answers!

Walked in...
Went over by the "service area", some old white haired  (not the tall one, the shorter.
The taller one was being awesome and helping a lady out) dude with a southern drawl asked if he could help me, I told him that I wanted my Hayward cleaner rebuilt, he informed me that there was one service ahead of me and "people milling about the store" and he could "maybe get to it today".
Then I heard him take a phone call, he was flat rude and told the person "I can't see the website, I can't tell you if we carry what they are showing you or not".
Rude...
I walked out.
Please give these store back to Shasta Pool so we can get prompt courteous service like we used to.
Guess you don't need my Hayward repair, new hose, and gasket sale, I'll take my $300 somewhere else.

I'm very lucky to live near this store.
Scott and Patrick (I think) are like pool demi-gods.
They've been great to work with and their wealth of knowledge is astounding.
Hold up a part, a broken part or a piece of a broken part or give them a bad description of it and they know exactly where that is in the store or where to get it if they don't have it.
The best part is watching when they are surrounded by customers asking questions about their different pools, one after the other, all at the same time, back and forth while never missing a beat (or looking at the subway sammich that was procured but not eaten 2 hours earlier).
My pool is open and ready for the season and the water has never felt better.

What is it with these Leslie Pool guys?
It doesn't matter which one I go to, they're all nasty and crabby.
They act like I'm a nuisance going in there to ask questions abiut, get this, my pool!
Or they treat me like I'm some kind of idiot and not worth their time.
Guess I'll just stick to B&B pools over at McClintock and baseline.
They are the absolute best.
