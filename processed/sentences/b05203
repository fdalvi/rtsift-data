This is a great little place.
It had a very comfortable feel.
The service was really friendly and attentive.
It reminded me of the show Cheers.
Everyone in there seemed to know eachother and was really friendly.
The food was really really good and I love the fact that we could eat at the bar and play video poker.
I would definitely recomend this place for a nice comfortable evening out with some great Mexican food ;)

Cozy bar with great atmosphere, friendly staff.
Mediocre typical bar food.
Everything we ate was just "ok".

Went in on a Friday night at 5:30 and every single table was empty.
That was my first clue.
The name says "Saloon", no beer on tap.
I ordered a bottle of beer and asked for a glass, it was dirty.
Wooden window blinds are completely covered in dust.
Now let me tell you about the food.
I ordered a salad and the lettuce was obviously poured out of a bag.
You know the kind, with the little shredded carrots in it.
It was stale.
My friend ordered potato soup.
It was a bowl of boiled potatoes, cut up with a boullion cube added for "flavor".
Also had something in it that resembled either undercooked bacon, or maybe it was bacon fat, I dunno.
It was gross.
She also ordered the Fish and Chips.
This looked like a large, deep fried, very overcooked, oozing grease fish stick.
It was like an episode of Kitchen Nightmares.
Now i know why the place is empty on a Friday evening.
I won't be back.
