Ladies looking for a nice and clean place to get your nails done... Come to foxy's... Jackie will take good care of you...

The people are so rude & the place looks dirty.

I've always gone here for my facial waxing & the occasional pedicure on special occasions.
Lately, the service has been lame, had my eyebrow wax done and she messed it up big time cus the lady was busy talking on the phone at the same time.
The towel you lay on to do your waxing is sooo filthy & has previous hair from whatever body part it came off from.
Had a pedi done recently, white tips, they don't do it well that it came off from one of my toes the very next day & I haven't even moved around or wore closed toe shoes...
Wished I asked for another coat of polish!
So much for my loyaly, I'm going somewhere else!
