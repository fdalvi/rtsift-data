An honest mechanic!
This place is a full service auto repair shop in addition to an "Xpress Lube.
"  I have been taking my vehicles here for a while now and am very pleased with the service.
The prices are fair and quality of the work is top notch.
The best part is that these guys are actually honest which unfortunately tends to be a rare quality with mechanics in this town.
I have been to a lot of auto repair shops in town and have not always been treated fairly.
I am happy to give this place five stars.
I will be back.

If I could give ZERO stars this place would get zero stars.
First, I went to pay this company with their own company credit card they informed me that they do not accept their own credit card.
Second, I had asked them to put Havoline Full Synthetic Blend in my car and when I was watching them I saw that they added ProLine Oil.
I asked the mechanic what type of oil was that and why did they not tell me that they did not carry Havoline oil.
I told him that was a bait and switch to make me pay $80.00 for a off the brand oil that I had never heard of.
I hope and pray nothing happens to my engine because I need to know who will pay for my engine.
So I will NEVER go back to these rip-off people ever again!!!
If you want to take your chances with your car then take it their... but I WILL NEVER TAKE IT THERE EVER AGAIN!!!
THEY ARE FRAUDS!!

Solid 3 Stars..
Friendly mechanics that get the work done!
Affordable prices, but just like ALL auto places they do get extra stuff in there..  As in you come in there for one thing but end up with other things that were added on and fixed.. Mostly come in for oil changes and most recently brakes..
Nonetheless still convenient and close to home!
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
