This restaurant is located in the plaza across from the marker on the map.
HKSR is a family-run business, serving up tasty dishes of all the common Chinese-Canadian fare.
General Tsao chicken - good stuff.
Portions were large enough to take home for another meal.
We ate in, but a lot of folks came by for take out.
Quite a popular place by all appearances.

Hong Kong Seafood Restaurant is a Chinese-Canadian restaurant in Kitchener at the Forest Glen Plaza.
I have been here many times over the years and they have consistently provided good food at good prices, like the lunch specials - I had the Chicken Lo Mein and it was a great hot meal for a cold fall day!
Newly renovated interior dining room (about 3 months ago) is great, and it is certainly more comfortable than ever to dine in, but it's always been more of a take out place for me.

Good food with great prices and awesome portion sizes.
We have been eating here for a few years now.
The portion sizes are quite large and we enjoy the takeout as it feeds more then one person.

HKSR is quite a nice little storefront restaurant (at Forest Glen Plaza on Strasburg) with traditional, consistently tasting Chinese cuisine.
They have upscaled the ambiance inside (a few years ago or so) and the usual female hostess is a sweetie and very attentive!
Take out is very efficient and 10% off.
Country Hills fav!
