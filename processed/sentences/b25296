Needed a formal dress pressed same day and they got me in and had the dress pressed an hour earlier than what I needed!
They did a great job and it was less than 4.00 how can you go wrong with that!
Amazing service at a fair price I have no complaints at all

I take dry cleaning and laundry to Cobblestone in Maricopa almost every week, so I know what I'm talking about when I say they do a fine job.
Other than one lost pair of khaki shorts, for which we were fairly compensated, we have had no complaints and have been very happy with the quality of the dry cleaning and laundry and the service at the front desk.
I purchased a membership, so my dry cleaning is slightly discounted, and i get a rebate toward future cleaning costs after reaching a certain level (I think it's $100).
I do recommend this dry cleaning facility.
