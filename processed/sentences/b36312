One of the best, if not the best Chinese restaurant in the K-W area.
The food is consistently good, the prices are fair and I have yet to order a menu item that disappointed me.
The service is decent, they are good with getting orders right even when there are special requests due to dietary or allergy concerns, however they can be a bit slow, especially with deliveries taking up to 2 hours, but usually being a little over an hour.
In fairness I do live a good 8 km away, which is a 15-20 minute drive on a good day.
The restaurant itself sits tucked beside a grocery store and is easy to miss when driving by, the atmosphere and decor is nothing special but is comfortable enough to sit an enjoy some great food.

Service was slightly less than courteous, but the food was excellent and quick.
Would def do again.

Rude service and over priced over cooked food.
Everything was really greasy and had a reheated taste.
