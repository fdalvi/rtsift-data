As you can see from the picture, these guys do old school Italian so i don't need to go into great detail about the look of the place.
I'll get straight to the food, first trip I had one of the specials, Mezze Lune.
Little pasta pockets stuffed with goats cheese in a creamy tomato sauce.
Yummy.
Second trip, we couldn't get a table.
Waited for 20 minutes then left.
Third trip I had Fieleto Diana, which was Â£18 but they gave me like half a cow served with a sweet onion sauce.
This place is pricey, but you're paying for the extra effort they put into the food.
