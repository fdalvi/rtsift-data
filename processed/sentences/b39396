The Mr. and I both love this place for routine work, including oil change.
I feel like Tim is honest and quick but always delivers top-notch service.

Never trust their oil changes.
I went there twice thinking they were doing it correctly only to believe that they weren't putting in enough oil and not telling me there was nothing to be done about this seeping oil problem and it's nothing to worried about because it wasn't "severe enough".
About a month later after this second change oil change my car starts shaking vigorously after .
As I take it in to a different shop to have it looked at they tell me that there is no oil showing on the dipstick and the damage done to my engine is irreparable.
Costing me $3,500 to replace it.
I would have filed a lawsuit against them for negligence if I had enough money to do it.
DO NOT GO HERE!

Avoid them at all costs.
Trust me from years of experience they will rip you off and make sure you are repeat business.
If you are in Mesa go to Network Automotive on Main.
They are honest and dependable and won't rip you off.
