I have had a tooth ache on and off for almost 6 months.
My doctor had me on antibiotics to fight it, at the same time I am fighting with terminal cancer.
The other day the pain got so bad that I couldn't sleep, eat or think of anything else but that throbbing in my mouth.
My sister called her dentist and he took me in right away.
He decided to do a root canal and am I ever grateful.
It was painless!
He was so patient and was sensitive to my issues.
I would highly recommend Dr. Michael Grode.
Wonderful, friendly staff too!

The staff is great but the front desk is way too abrupt.
If the front desk would be half as good at customer service as everyone else they would be 5 star.

I am extremely nervous when it comes to dental work so when I found out that I needed 4 fillings I was not thrilled.
But I did the research and decided on getting composite fillings instead of amalgam.
Dr Bjork was patient and kind.
He hooked me up with the laughing gas which really eased my anxiety and then I didn't need lidocaine either.
He many times during the procedure checked on how I was doing.
He has a nice soothing voice which helps as well.
The dental hygienist was also very nice and comforting.
Neither one of them made me feel like a lunatic for being anxious.
After this experience I would use Dr Bjork again.
Not that I want more cavities but I don't think I would be as anxious next time.
Their out of pocket prices are comparable to other dentists in the area and they give a discount if you pay by cash or check.
All in all I had a good experience.
I also use them for my dental exams and cleanings.
Always nice patient people.
Would definitely recommend them.
