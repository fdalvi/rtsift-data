It's all about the gas station here.
More often than not they are one of the cheapest in the valley.
Not a huge fan of the store itself because of the customers, not the staff but I love the gas prices here so I have to give this location a 4!

I do most of my grocery shopping here due to proximity, plus the discount you get on gas is a great incentive.

Gas prices are really good here.
Usually I drove a couple blocks more and gas is more expensive than here.
Another thing, if you get the rewards card from Food 4 Less and for every $100 of groceries you spend, you get 10Â¢ off per gallon, Pretty good I would say!

Love shopping here always a friendly customer service  and fresh veggies and fruits, and very good deals on ur daily house needs
