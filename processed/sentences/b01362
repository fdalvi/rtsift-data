McDonald's is McDonald's.
My "beef" with this place is they stopped selling ice and I prefer not to have to drive all over town in search of ice while wearing pajamas!

Pros: It's McDonald's.
the food here is OK, and the location is convenient to my house.
Cons: slow service, long lines, and have had to pull around several times because of messed up orders.
the actual customer service is terrible here.
no more ice, especially on a day like the 4th of July.
friendly, NO!.
never been inside this McDonalds location, only in the corner store, which is a different story!
I guess convenience come with a price, not physically but verbally!

went back there today and asked for two simple burgers with nothing but ketchup and cheese, not hard, right?
apparently it is if your english is as good as your order taking skills

I really like the remodeling going on

Was there Friday morning around 9am- rudest young guy working the order window and took our payment.
That guy has no business in the customer service industry.

Don't plan on picking up a quick cup of coffee-or anything else-on the way to work!
You will waste an easy 10" getting through the drive-through: first No One is manning the order mike and when you get to the window to both pay and get your order-there is complete chaos!
They seem uncertain as to what you ordered-try to hand-out a completely wrong order-or are surprised you are sitting in your car outside their window in the first place!
This place has ABSOLUTELY the worst McD 's  service of ANY I have been to in this country!
Isn't there some award they could receive for this distinction?
