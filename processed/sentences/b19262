Its the best pho in k.w,and most places I have been to in t.dot

Good food but could be spicier.
Just dumping on the sriracha and sambar Orleans isn't what I was looking for.
It's good and not expensive, so go for it.

Of the three Pho Dau Bo's, this is the worst.
Incredibly inconsistent from visit to visit.
1/2 the time food is not very hot, meat is either overcooked or reheated and tough.
The other two are by far better.
Really enjoy Pho Dau Bo
