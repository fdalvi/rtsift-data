I've had the best experience with the Pecos Smart Storage...from the price to the exceptional service, I couldn't be happier.
The units are clean and cooled on the inside.
The office staff was more than helpful, explaining everything.
They walked me through entering my code on the gate, they made sure my door opened properly and made sure I understood the office hours and the access hours.
They even called me to correct a slight billing error that ended up being in my favor!
Who does that??
I have recommended this site to a family member that got a unit there and has received the same personal attention.
Thumbs up!

Great Place to rent Storage.
Tiera, specifically, impressed me with the follow-up and way she accomodated my specific situation.
Man, they are ON IT!
:)  They aren't indifferent to getting your business!
Go visit them to see what they can do for you.
Great place.
