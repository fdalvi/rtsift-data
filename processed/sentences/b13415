Staff are friendly and willing to help.
Store is clean and selection is good.

Do not purchase anything that requires delivery from this place, ever.
I purchased a washer and dryer from here.
It was supposed to be delivered Sunday.
I spoke with customer service and they said it would be rushed this morning.
It is now Monday, 4pm and no washer or dryer.
I tried to simply track my order through telephone over TWELVE times.
I was hung up on repeatedly.
This was due to the fact of being transferred to unattended phone lines.
I called about ten minutes ago to find out their reliable staff somehow managed to dent in a part of my dryer.
I HAD TO CALL TO FIND THIS OUT.
No one contacted me.
I cancelled my entire order that was over two thousand dollars.
This place is terrible.
I am completely disgusted with their lack of effort and professionalism.

These guys are always great when I visit this location.
Friendly staff and quick to help.
Always willing to go the extra mile to try and help.

If you like walking around a store and going back into the parking lot for your cart this is the store for you.
Poorly set up store.
