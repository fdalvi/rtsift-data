Got my wife a bike here.
Good service, quality setup, they know their stuff.
(it was cheaper than other bike shops too, I mean for a good road bike)

Great service, they know their stuff.
Awesome prices.
Ask for one of the Rays.
He loves his wife!

This is the best bike shop in the west valley quite possibly the entire valley!
Ray is the man.
Personable and fair, no elitist who's or attitudes.
I went in for service on dare I say a wal mart bike, and got no attitude just honest help and spectacular service.
They also have a huge selection of bicycles and gear.
I was not disappointed and you won't be either.
Definitely my long term local bike shop!

Just got my bike all tuned up and ready for 5 more years of riding.
Great service from the folks at AzCyclery.
Good balance of high end and hobbiest needs.
