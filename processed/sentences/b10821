It's almost 2011 and the sales lady still follows Black people around the store.
What made it worse is she tried to stay hidden... as if I wouldn't see her ducking in-n-out of the aisles every time I turned around.
There is much nicer fashion out there.
There's no reason to spend time or money at this place.

I bought a pair of men's Jeans on Sale(50% offf) here the day before Christmas.
The store is large, beautiful and visual.
The male staff that assisted me was good as well as the woman who rdid the money transaction.
Thank You both.
The shopping bags are nice too.
Was told by the female associate that this store is the largest RC store in the world besides the Paris location.
Love Roberto Cavalli clothing.
