Wish we had gone with Dave Dix and Long Realty when we originally listed our home.
We switched to Dave after 9 months of minimal activity and interest from original realtor.
In 6 weeks Dave have more activity than we had in 6 months.
He actively marketed our home, held numerous Open Houses to drive activity.
Most importantly, he was there to show our home along with buyer's realtor.
No one knows your house as well as you do.
We spent considerable with Dave to share specific features of our home with him.
This really made a difference in prospects seeing all of the features of the home and specifics of neighborhood.
Once we had a contract, Dave was instrumental in securing reliable repairman to do minor needed repairs identified in the inspection.
With the construction market picking up, many of our regular service people were unable to assist us on a timely basis to ensure a quick closing.
Truly the only realtor located in the Moon Valley area of North Phoenix.
Local office is unique with shared space with Dunkin Donuts, but it gets LOTS of exposure with people in the area.
It is a very professional seating, I was pleasantly service in this unique situation.
Would highly recommend Dave and his group for local needs.
