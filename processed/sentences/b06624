Tasty pizza, but hardly supreme.
We ordered a 12 inch thick crust double bacon cheeseburger pizza, and paid about $15.
The crust was thick, soft and tasty, but the sauce seemed to be straight tomato paste with no seasonings aside from an excessive amount of oregano.
They were stingy on the meat, to the point that we had to hunt for the bacon and even the hamburger seemed overwhelmed by the flavors of oregano and pickles (yes, they put pickles on their cheeseburger pizza).
I enjoyed the food, but there are a lot of pizza places in Madison, and you can get better food for less at most of them.

Supreme and sublime.
Best pizza and calzones (whole wheat) on the Near East Side.
In my opinion, the Near East Side could have a better pizza place.
The calzones in particular -- made from whole wheat and with some 30 toppings to choose from -- are phenomenal.
Dave, the owner, will not only match any coupon, but he has all-you-can-eat spaghetti every day and $5 pizzas when you buy a regular pizza.
PLus, this place is open until 11pm.
Which means you can stay and study.
That's right - 11pm!
The coffee place next door closes as a wimpy 9pm.
Sadly, because "Pizza Extreme" has a similar name, this local and independent spot has not received the attention it deserves.

Even though we were the only customers there, we had to wait an hour for our mediocre pizza.
At one point while we waited, another customer (apparently a regular customer) came in with his dog.
We watched as the dog walked through the kitchen area.
Yuck.
If we hadn't been starving, we would have left immediately.
