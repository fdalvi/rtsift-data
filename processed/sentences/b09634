Whenever I'm looking for something quick to eat and there's a Del Taco nearby, it's one of the first places I consider.
I was playing golf at the Wig Wam golf course and this location was right off the 101, so I stopped to grab breakfast before my round of golf.
I ordered 2 Del Cheeseburgers ($4.58) via the drive thru.
It came out fast, fresh, and accurate....there's not much more I could ask for.
If I'm in the area again I know there's a Del Taco I can count on.
Return Factor - 75%

The only reason I am giving this place 4 stars is the food always comes out hot and fresh.
Service can be slow, but the crinkle fries are worth the wait.
I like this place over taco Bell because sometimes u just want fries with that taco or burrito!
