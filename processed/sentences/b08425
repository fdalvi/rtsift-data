I love love love balaros.
My mom met elmira, the owner, when she was pregnant with me and I have been there ever since.
I drifted once and had my hair destroyed but Mrs myra fixed me!
Tamika is my stylist now and she never disappoints!
She gave me cold.fusion extensions and I love them.
I was also a hair model for felicia and she made me into a lion and dang was I FIERCE!!
Everytime I need a cut, color, or style I can go to any stylist and they never disappoint!!
If ur new.in town or looking for a new stylist go here!!
And what I love is not only do they take care of my hair but they instruct me on how to take care of it myself.
And yes people...they do all hair types!!

Been going here for years and always great service!
Love the hair dressers!
They have saved my hair sooooo many times!
Anytime I try out a new place I always come back to them to fix whatever the other salon did lol!
Never going anywhere else but here!
Thank you!

I just visited today and calling around and I am very pleased with my hair.
I just moved here and it is hard finding new EVERYTHING!
I visited this place based on proximity to my home and the other review.
I'm glad I did.
Johnele (I think that's how it's spelled) and the other ladies were so nice.
It truly felt like a family.
The price was great too.
I will be back!

Always accommodating, wonderful group of people.
Knowledgeable about hair.
I came here and Elmira took care of my weave and helped my natural hair grow past shoulder length so I don't have to wear a weave anymore.
The people in the shop are good with natural and processed hair!
Thank you!
