Wow, so this is what old-school Barber Shops are supposed to be like?
Awesome.
Only tried a few barber shops, in San Francisco, but was (pleasantly) surprised when I found this place.
I forget their names, but went twice, liked the job both of them did: a great job, plus a straight-edge w/warm cream, PLUS the shoulder-massage-thingy (that I wasn't expecting, and didn't see it coming, since the mirror was behind me).
Great job, guys!

Be warned!
The owner of this place...John?
Doesn't have a filter and has inappropriate language around kids.
Not to mention he smokes in his own bathroom!
Who does that?
You can't go outside?
Wouldn't that be against city code?
The other barber is okay thus the two stars.
Not going back.

My first visit yesterday was a pleasant surprise!
Tom was great, the atmosphere friendly and clean.
Vintage touches including hot shaving cream and shoulder massage bring back memories of barbers who cared about their clients.
I'll be back.

I didn't do a good job of reading the reviews on yelp.
My fault.
This place has two profiles,  one with obvious fake reviews, and that was the one I looked at when choosing to come here.
This place is pretty nasty.
Is a small space,  so replacing the carpet would cost all of $200 but instead its seriously old and stains all over.. plus,  here is the kicker,  smells like they smoke inside the shop!
SMOKE INSIDE THE SHOP!
!!Omg!
There is a review that says this place is clean,  omg, I had to look around to make sure I was at the same place when I read that.
A child's haircut is $17 (um....Vs barbershop charges $15 and the place is clean and professional).
They then changed me $1 to accept my credit card.
..what a joke this place is,  the haircut was Ok.  No,  I will  never ever come back.
How does this place stay in business?
Yuck.
