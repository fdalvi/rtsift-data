JetBox is one of the new food vendors in Terminal 4.
As I have not traveled out of Terminal 2 or 3, I do not know if there are other locations.
It is mostly food on a tortilla, and that being prepared mostly offsite and served hot here.
The basic burrito, with grilled veggies, guacamole and sour cream struck me as about right for a recent meal at the airport.
I did not feel like chicken or beef, so asked for the above combination.
When register chickie rang it up, it was a burrito with chicken, a $9 plus offering.
On asking register chickie how she could justify a charge for a chicken burrito, she responded that it was the cheapest burrito on the menu.
I asked to speak with the manager.
He came forward and advised that register chickie was correct, this was the cheapest burrito offering on the register keypad.
When I asked him to justify the chicken, he thought a minute and had register chickie change the order to a hot dog.
While meat was still in the "order", the price reflected a $3 discount.
Thanks for hearing me out and seeing the logic in my assertion.

Ordered a chicken burrito here on Friday, June 28th.
Onset of FOOD POISONING was swift and severe.
Spent Saturday pretty much bed-ridden.

9.90 for a cold wrap with tax.
So much for street prices.
The wrap was ok but the price is more than most of the better restaurants
