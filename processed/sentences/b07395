Absolutely my favorite place for prescription glasses in the Valley.
I positively adore my Prada glasses and find myself opting to wear those in place of the comfort of contacts.
Dr. Sherwin was very pleasant and easy to work with, although the office was at times a bit cluttered.
Nonetheless, it was a good experience.
J'adore!

Sherwin doesn't call back.
I ordered glasses from him that were $450, and I never heard from him again.
I left 3 voicemails to no avail.
I am usually not one to write a bad review, but this one was necessary.
I would never support his business again.

You can not find a better Optician than Sherwin.
He knows his lens and frames.
His prices are very fair.Best of all, he is a fine gentleman, and a pleasure to deal with...

Sherwin is old and not very reliable but he is a really nice guy.
I will give him that much.
Very good optician as well

Sherwin is very well versed in his field.
His prices are some of the best for prescription lenses.

Just the nicest optical store in town!
They had just been broken into a night earlier, yet took all the time I needed to get the glasses I wanted.
I have been to other "swankier" optical shops, and left feeling much lighter in my wallet but not like I had any reason to want to go back.
Sherwin has been in the Valley for decades, starting out his career at one of the shops I remember from my younger days.
He's moved on, opened his own store and I'm so glad I found him!
He was very helpful in choosing the right frame, and his style and color advice was much appreciated.
I highly recommend this store.
