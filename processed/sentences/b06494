No milk for the coffee.
Only cream.
No wonder everyone is fat.
Get my coffee, and it's half full.
Awesome.
All in all, all Micky D's in Vegas suck.
On a side note, the new oatmeal is pretty damn good.

HOW SAD!
If you yelpers don't give Mcdonalds 5 stars you are on crack this place is Gods gift to the world!
Long live the Big Mac!

I love McDonald's... Duh but I'm eating my mcchicken and the bun is hard which usually happens after 9pm anyways!
Oh well I also ordered Big Mac and 20 pc.
Chicken nugget...
When we got to the window I asked for various sauces including an "Asian sauce" but the guy at the window took total offense and copped an attitude with me.
He asked if I meant sweet chili sauce??
I felt like I may have upset him for some reason (but we are all ppl and I wouldn't have been insulted if he asked me for white sauce!!
LoL) so I said sorry and that I meant the Kung pao sauce.
But he said that didn't exist and was a dick!
I'm glad I didn't ask for gay sauce.
Ha!
Dude come on.
Ppl r ppl.
It is what it is!

This place is infamous for having a rude cashier and not having things in stock.
Complaints to management here go on deaf ears.
I go out of my way to go to the one on Durango cause of so many bad experiences here- this location really gives the brand a bad name!

I'm drunk, I come here and order a hot and spicy ( sub The mannaise  with Mac sauce) and 2 breakfast burritos.
Tell me why I didn't get any hot and spicy???
What the fudge??
