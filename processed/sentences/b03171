Excellent Health care  This is a family practice but the cater mostly to geriatric patients, but they are skilled in everything your family needs.
Most of your lab work can be done in house at most times sames day (no appointment/copay).
The PA and NP's are excellent and you will not see a big difference in care.
This is a large practice and very busy, but you will not feel rushed when you get your time with the health professionals.
They try to do as much care as they can for patients rather than making you see a specialist, but they know when referrals are needed.

Don't go here.
They schedule appointments and when you get there, they don't have you in their calendar.
The office manager Lori has no customer service skills.
They don't resolve issues with a satisfactory solution, they resolve it at YOUR expense.
Your time is worth nothing to them.
They are always late seeing patients and make you wait for long periods of time.
Don't waste your time here.
The only thing going for this low tech office is the doctors and nurse practitioner are good but the office is run inefficiently.
They also make coding errors and any mistakes made on their part is always going to be YOUR PROBLEM!!
