The yogurt here is pretty good and the setup matches that of U-Swirl.
They have two sizes of bowls and the yogurt is $0.45/oz.
The fruit toppings are big and fresh, but their liquid toppings are sparse---just white chocolate and caramel.
The one thing they have here that isn't at the U-Swirls I've been to is that you can mix the side-by-side yogurts together.
I would only go here if I was at the mall, but I was pretty satisfied with my frozen yogurt 'cause I ate it all.

Its pretty yummy here!!
I love they have super fresh fruit and yummy candies/junk.
Im not too crazy about the tart flavor, but the vanilla and asp pom was delish!!
They have 3 sizes and at the end I paid 3.90 for a pretty good portion.
The customer service here is super and thats why I would go back!!
Everything is fresh, yummy, and theyre super sweet!

My hubby and I stopped by here while at the Meadows Mall.
I was not expecting much as I am not an ice cream person.
My husband chose the raspberry pomegranate and love it so much he wished he filed up the whole cup.
I had the tart flavor and was super pleased!
The flavors were great!
I liked that that the calories were listed, it made it easier to decide on how much to get.
We'll definitely be back!
