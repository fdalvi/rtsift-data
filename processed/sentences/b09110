Okay, I love Oregenos and wrote glowingly about Ray's and NYPD a few days ago, but this is not them.
It is something I crave every so often, so I really need to learn to fight these urges.
Ugh!

I ordered a large pepperoni pan pizza togo.
I normally like pizza hut but for some  reason the pizza seemed way to greasy and didn't taste that great.
In fact I got naseous after eating 2 slices.

In the past, there were spans when I would order pizza WAY too often.
Lately, I've been eating a lot healthier...though, I'm not made of stone.
Of the delivery pizza places, I like Pizza Hut the most.
Their on-line ordering feature is extremely intuitive, allowing you to visually customize your exact order.
This particular location just so happens to be the one assigned to deliver to my location.
In the short time I've lived here, I've always had pleasant experiences with the delivery people.
They always seem to be happy, and are decently engaged.
Also, they always seem to arrive early or on-time...which is kind of important.
All in all, the Via Linda Pizza Hut is a reliable choice for a decent pizza in my opinion.
If you're looking for a tasty break from the normal pizza, try a Thin Crust Chicken + Jalapeno...but be warned...I think Pizza Hut harvests some of these peppers from the center of the sun.
Not ALL of them...but there are a few that make you sniffle something fierce.

Nice people but crappy pizza.
Barely enough cheese on pizza.
We left like eating dough only.
Not going back.
