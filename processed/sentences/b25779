this was the second gel manicure at this salon, my nails were filed down to mush, even with the gel polish on them they bend like crazy, both thumbnails broke the next day, won't go back

Been here three times with my elderly father and with sisters.
Today Bob is doing a great job.
The foot massage is the best ever.

Very professional and friendly I am new at this and tried several different salons but this one is the best they are all very good but I highly recommend Kathy she does pedicures, I have ingrown toenails and she works hard at helping me become pain free Thank you Shelly Kinyon
