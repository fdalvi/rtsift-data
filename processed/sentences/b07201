This is a great spot to go in Downtown Phoenix directly across the street from America West Arena.
You can stop in before or after a game for good food, drinks and ambiance or watch the game at the bar.

A solid little cafeteria on the 10th floor of City hall.
The good news is it's open to the public, and it's cheap.
If you're looking for a decent little bite to eat downtown, and looking to keep prices low, this is as good as any fast food joint in the city.
The food mostly consists of you'd expect to find inside a cafeteria.
Burgers and sandwiches make up most of what I noticed on the menu.
I went in pretty early and decided to go with a breakfast burrito.
It was far from the best I'd ever had, but for the low price of just $3.50, I can't complain.
What I will complain about is that service was pretty slow.
As a small line started to form, none of the employees came over to help the one who was taking orders and cooking.
They also charge a convenience fee with credit cards.
It's only 24 cents, but I didn't see the sign until after I handed the cashier the card, and she charged me.
Not to sound cheap, but if it had been posted in a spot before the register, I would've used cash.

Walking distance from the office.
The breakfast (2 eggs, hash browns, bacon, toast, jalapeno, iced tead w/ lemon) $5.25.
Lunch specials are all around $5.
The view is nice with window seating.
Orders are made to order, so it takes a few more minutes.
The crowd is City of Phoenix employees ranging from lawyers to police officers.
It's a place to eat modest priced home cooked feel food.
