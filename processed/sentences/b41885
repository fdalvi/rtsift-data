Chancery Lane is a cute new salon inside Sola Salon.
The British themed decorations were cool and the tea set was a nice touch!
Kelly is the owner and stylist and she gave me an awesome haircut.
I said, "make me look like David Beckham!
"   She laughed and said "she'd do her best!
"    I'm new to Vegas and lucky to find my new stylist on the first try.

I met Kelly through a friend after I had moved from Palm Springs and had my hair done by the same person for years.
I tried going to a few different people and had some horrible experiences!
I am super picky with how my blonde color comes out.
I have natural ash blonde hair which tends to come out yellow, orange or brassy if it's not bleached and toned the correct way.
I told Kelly from the get go what I wanted and explained how I wanted my hair to be white/platinum blonde, and she did just that!
She listened and had a lot of up to date knowledge on what she was doing.
She made me feel comfortable and my hair looked amazing!
Kelly is an incredible stylist and I would recommend her to anyone!

Kelly M. is amazing!!
I'm so sad I'm moving when I finally found a stylist that does hair right.
She took her time and explained every step she was doing.
I was nervous getting color and a Brazilian blowout before my wedding, but I'm so happy I went to her!!
I seriously haven't stopped getting compliments and I really feel like she genuinely cared about making my hair better than before.
And she was as nice/sweet as she was professional!
Definitely recommend!
