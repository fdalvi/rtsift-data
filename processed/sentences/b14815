This company makes frequent calls to Phoenix phone numbers on the National Do Not Call list using their autodialer software.
They claim ignorance of all privacy laws.
Do not do business with them.

A company which makes telemarketing calls to numbers on the National Do Not Call List, and blocks their Caller ID on those calls, is either incompetent or unconcerned about doing things right.
I've been on the Do Not Call list since it was first set up, but receive calls from Reliant Window, with Caller ID "Private Number".
This tells me everything I need to know about the company as soon as they identify themselves.

Just got a call from this outfit claiming their name is "Reliant Capitol" and it is.
Plus many other names.
Not sure about their work but don't care for their marketing techniques.
We are also on the Do Not Call list and they showed up as unlisted.
Folks if you want to earn my business, please be more honest.
