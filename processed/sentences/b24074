Friendliest F-ers (FedEx-ers) I've ever encountered!
Well staffed with employees who actually want to help you and aren't there to try and gouge you in upgrades and weights and ish.
Maybe that's just how Wisconsin folk are, though.
I got something printed at this location for $2.50 that according to the Illini F-ers, was going to cost me AT LEAST $39.99... whatta buncha crooked copiers.

I've used this place for work projects a number of times now, and I just feel like I have to publicly praise them.
These people are SO FAST.
I'm a big email/text person as opposed to phone calls, so I was overjoyed to find out how quickly this place responds to emails - like, "send-in-a-question-at-2 pm-get-an-answer-by-2:30" quick.
And then!
You place your order, and get a phone call within a couple hours to tell you it's ready for pickup.
One time it was 20 minutes for me, no joke.
I've never had any complaints about quality or pricing either, although I've only ever placed simple orders (getting color copies printed in large quantities).
But for those simple orders, their promptness really cannot be beat.

Normally I'm really happy with this Fedex location.
I had a HORRIBLE experience here this morning with the Assistant Manager, who provided a textbook example of enforcing policy without purpose.
Unhappy.
