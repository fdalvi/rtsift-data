The gym is older and a new gym is being built.
That being said the gym is always clean and most of the equipment is running.
The staff are very friendly also.
The gym offers a cardio room, a weight room upstairs, a basketball court and classes including zumba, yoga, pilates and spin classes.
The gym also offers personal training sessions for cost.
Right now they have a special to get 3 training sessions for free.
There is also a smoothie stand in the gym with delicious smoothies.

Definitely a fan, This was the first time i actually ever used the base gym.
I usually utilize plANET fitness but will be canceling my membership.
The machines are great and new and work well.
Friendly staff that cares about your needs or weight loss goals and i dont feel like im surrounded by juice heads because we are all in the same boat.

It's military and I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
