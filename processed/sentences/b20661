This is a good Chinese restaurant located on Portobello High Street, I have only come here once, but I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and the staff were very friendly.
I cycled to Portobello from the city centre with my friend and we both agreed that no matter what we ate, no matter how stodgy, it could be justified, because we would have burnt it off by the time we had cycled back.
I ordered curry sauce with chicken and fried rice with prawn crackers to share with my friend and it came to less than Â£10 each, which is pretty good value as the portions were pretty big, and this was the sitting in price, the prices to take away are cheaper.
The meal wasn't actually all that stodgy at all and the meal didn't seem all that greasy.
The prawn crackers weren't however all that crispy and seemed a bit soft, but other than that it was a good meal, and would return in the future.

This is my favourite Chinese Restaurant in the area.
We often have friends round and order a home delivery.
Never had anything but plaudits for the food.
The staff are always friendly and helpful.
Could not recommend this plac Elmore.
