After checking out t his little dive several times, I feel I can finally write a review.
So, the first time I stopped in with my friend, I was surprised (and slightly horrified) to walk in to this scene: lots of barely clothed boys waiving their junks around.
Eeek!
They kept trying to get us to buy their jell-o shots and it was a bit gross.
Second time, however, was much better.
My friend and her dude were there (he hosts karaoke on Friday nights), and it was a more comfortable setting.
Lot's of singing and clapping and yippin' and yawwin' (ok maybe not that last part, but you get the idea).
I find that in most gay man bars, I have a hard time getting service at the bar.
This one is no exception, but they don't take as long to recognize my fierce femme self...so that's cool.
All in all, it is A-ok, and that's just fine by me.

Sorry guys, but this one was a dud.
Went here with a few friends for a drag show because one chickie in the posse had a friend/co-worker performing...we left within 30 minutes.
The biggest reason we left was because 2 of us REALLLLLLY had to go to the bathroom, the ladies restroom was being used as a dressing room, so we couldn't get in there, so (adaptable and easy-going as we are) we went over to the men's restroom.
We were treated SO RUDELY by several of the men in line that it just made sense to saran-wrap our bladders and head over to a friendlier watering hole.
To quote the wise Sweet Brown..."Ain't nobody got time fo' dat.

Plain and simple; it's a dive bar with friendly staff.
Added bonus is the jukebox is always ready go!
