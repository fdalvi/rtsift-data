Decided to try this shop out because its owned and operated by a veteran of our US Army, I was not disappointed...excellent customer service and prices...I am glad I found this shop!

Great place!!
Love the service!
Didn't feel haggled to get more than I really needed.
Didn't feel overcharged.
Carl is very friendly and I wouldn't take my car anywhere else.

Wow!
I am so impressed with the professionalism and personal care that I received here.
From the very beginning I knew I was in good hands and was not being overcharged or pressured into a thing.
If you are looking for personal one-on-one care for your vehicle this is the place.

carl seems to be an honest and trustworthy ASE certified mechanic.
he saved me a ton of money($900) and i'll go back to him w/ all 3 of my vehicle needs.
I highly recommend his shop as he's competent, qualified and his hourly rate is more than competitive.
if u don't try veterans auto, you'll pay more.
thx for your service carl, you have my biz!

Took my truck in for a leak that another shop spotted during the last oil change.
Carl got me in quick and is a straight shooter.
Turned out there wasn't really a leak.
He had me in and out in less than 30 minutes.
Another shop may not have been as honest.
I would highly recommend this shop, owned and operated by a vet!

i found Veterans Auto on craigs list.
I took my mini van to carl after another shop could not keep my check engine light from coming back on.
he found the problem was a cracked T in the vacuum line and bad EGR sensor.
he had it repaired for less than the other shop charged w/ no fix and I passed emissions easily.
i'll be back for sure.
honest, inexpensive ASE certified car care, thx carl!
