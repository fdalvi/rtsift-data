I love Red Robin.
It's an amazing place and I have rated other locations a 5, but this location only gets a 4 because I went there today and was FREEZING the whole time.
I was so uncomfortable.
The food was amazingly tasty as usual and all five of us were really happy with the meal and the service, it was just way way too cold.
I would definitely recommend heading here for one of the many awesome gourmet burgers or the fiesta fajita salad, but BRING A JACKET!!!!!!!!

I've been to this Red Robin a few times and went again tonight and I can honestly say that I've never had a bad experience there.
The menu runs mainly along the gourmet burger/sandwich/salad route which is usual for a chain restaurant that is family friendly.
I've mostly had the burgers and once had a salad and everything has always been prepared to my liking.
The burger menu has quite a few options to it and they are pretty cool with letting you substitute whatever you like on them.
I usually get the 'Sauteed 'Shroom and Swiss' burger and it's always been just what a mushroom Swiss burger should be.
Lots of melted gooey Swiss cheese and lots of fresh mushrooms which they saute in a garlic butter.
Since I need to watch my carbs (that old blood sugar thing going on) I usually get the burger wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun and get steamed veggies instead of the all you can eat fries.
I have tried the fries at times and do recommend them but usually go with the veggies.
I have always had great service.
Always greeted promptly by a smiling server who never lets my drink go empty.
The food always comes out in a short time and is always served hot.
It may not fit everyone's bill....but if you're looking for a good burger at a good value I highly recommend it.
And FYI....for the holidays they are offering a gingerbread shake which sounds great.
Someday while doing some holiday shopping over in Tempe I'll have to stop in for one.....on one of those days that I am REALLY watching the carb count.

I like going to Red Robin; however, I do not particularly like the one located at the Tempe Marketplace.
My boyfriend and I decided to eat dinner there last Sunday night.
We were pretty hungry and we thought that Red Robin would hit the spot.
I was looking forward to the Salmon Burger.
We were seated immediately in a booth.
We looked through the menu and decided what we wanted to eat.
After five minutes, no one came to greet us.
Waitresses kept walking by, but no one stopped to say hi or get our drink order.
We waited five more minutes, by that time we were looking around to see if we had a waitress.
Still no one...we decided to leave and go to In-N-Out Burger.
I was really looking forward to a Salmon Burger, but I don't like bad service much less no service.
The location was not busy at all and there was no reason from my end why someone couldn't come up to us and let us know what was going on.
Those other waitresses passed by us and even looked right at us.
They knew we weren't getting served.
They could have possibly kept me there if they acknowledged that we were there and would locate our waiter/waitress.
I know this is one incident, but it really puts a bad taste in my mouth.

My mind was on the burning love burger all afternoon.
When I finally made it here to get it, I was beyond excited.
While we were walked to our extremely small table, we were walked past a few booths that we could have sat at, if they were actually cleaned.
The service was so-so.
We ordered an appetizer and everything came out all at once which really irked me.
A part of serving is timing which obviously our server didn't understand.
She also didn't understand that checking up on the table once during the dinner is unacceptable.
She did offer me a freckled lemonade at the end which was nice, but all in all I didn't even really feel like she served us.

Went here again today.
Just a side note to what I previously mentioned.
This is NOT the place to come and watch a game.
Now that baseball season is back (FINALLY) I decided to eat lunch here and sit in the cocktail area to catch a bit of a game.
Their televisions are tiny and from where I could see were neither flat screens or HD.
Boo.
Service was bad again.
The server was really cute but seemed not to give a crap.
It looked like he was getting his bar cleaned and shut down so he could go home but there were three tables in the cocktail area, all needing to either be greeted or helped, and he ignored us.
Oh and my salad came out with avocado slices, even though the picture on the table showed that it was supposed to come with them.
So the servers don't really have a clue what they are doing and neither do the cooks, obviously.
This is my strike two at this location.
They have one more chance and that's only because their burgers are so darn good.

It's your standard Red Robin.
Once again, I was with a large group of people (40 or so) and though we were first turned away from RR due to seating, they called us back to tell us that they had room for us.
Kinda sorta nice.
The waiter for my table was impossibly nice and courteous (we definitely tipped well) and the food arrived pretty quickly.
Again, standard RR.
I had a salmon burger, and the only bad thing was that the salmon started to break apart half way through.
Oh well.
It doesn't really deserve four stars, but it doesn't deserve three either.
Ehh.
3.5, then.

Food is what you expect from a chain restaurant, always the same with little imagination.
You know what you are getting and it never dissapoints based on expectations.
Our waitress however exceeded expectations.
Jessie was attentive, friendly and did everything to make our lunch experience at Red Robin a pleasant one.
If the manager reads this, Jessie is by far the best waitress I've ever had at a Red Robin.

I like Red Robin.
There, I said it.
I've never had a bad waiter experience and the food has always been just what I've expected.
Big ups to this location though.
My group made a reservation for 60 people for lunch yesterday.
I called an hour or so before our time to ask if it was cool if we came in a little early, and apparently there was a mix-up with the days because they thought we were coming in the following day.
What could have been a huge disaster was not because they quickly accommodated us and after about a 5-minute wait we were all seated in the dining area.
They had no problem splitting checks, our food came out at a reasonable time, drinks were filled, great experience.

ACK!
I haven't been to a Red Robin in years.
I remembered liking it.
However yesterday was very iffy and not sure if I would go back.
I went here yesterday with a friend for lunch.
Our waitress was very uninterested in us being there.
We ordered our drinks and some onion rings.
The onion rings come out as a tall stack on this tall metal object, I was leaning forward talking to my friend when the waitress tries to shove the onion rings onto the table damn near taking my eye out.
She was close enough that I felt the heat of the onion rings on my face.
Aside from near blindness, they were good.
We both ordered grilled chicken sandwiches, and both agreed that they were the most god awful grilled chicken sandwiches there could be.
despite the gobs of sauce on them, the chicken itself had no flavor...and was rubbery.
I had some sort of pesto cibata chicken, the bun was soggy on one side.
Soggy bread makes me gag, its the worst.
Wet bread ::shivers:: they put a pesto sauce on it, some sort of diced tomato concoction and then a very odd flesh toned sauce.
No clue.
I took two bites off the none soggy side and that's all I could bear.
I will say though, the french fries are freaken Yum!
That is what saved me from starving to death.
My friend doesn't like confrontation so I didn't send it back, if I was there with anyone else, this meal would have sure been sent back.

Mediocre at best.
This place is a wonderful example of American cuisine gone wrong.
When a restaurant relies on salt and mayonnaise as the staple flavor profile, the food is well, boring (i.e.
Chipotle Mayo).
Red Robin is a burgers and fries type place, fried everything.
Fried everything should be DELICIOUS!
What is missing?
The presentation of all the dishes is fine, it is the utter lack of flavor that was so disappointing.
Had a burger and onion rings, and while there was nothing particularly wrong with it, it was completely forgettable.
The atmosphere is very corporate.
The service is designed to be good, but falls flat, again too corporate (waiter virtually up your ass when you don't need him, and not around when you do).
In summary, there are way better places to spend your time, money and calories.
We gave it a shot, and it wasn't our cup of tea.
If you like it, more power to you.
I usually do not review restaurants until I have given them several chances and tried different items, but I won't be returning.
I just can't bring myself to eat here.
The food is edible, but while I was eating, I actually wondered to myself why I was eating it.

I went here today for lunch with my best friend.
We were seated quickly and had a very nice waiter.
We both liked our lunches - her chicken caesar wrap and me bonzai burger.
I like the seasoning salt for the fries and my hamburger was cooked perfectly and tasted really good.
I would definately go here again with a group.
The menu has something for everyone.

I love Burgers & Beer.
I love Beer and good food.
The Burnin Love Burger at Red Robin rocks!
The flavor is all over the place.
I can say this about most of their burgers although this burger takes the cake.
Oh wait, I forgot I added some of the fried jalapenos from my friends plate into the burger.
Yum!
I prefer to sit at the bar to avoid being distracted from my delicious food by the "oh so lovely kids.
" The bartenders are always Awesome with the specialty drinks Red Robin throws out every so often.
One thing I love is that they are cool when I ask to try one of the special drinks and they make a mini.
Although I would recommend the Mug Drafts!

Went here a few days ago with the family.
We've been to this Red Robins a few times (birthdays, events, casual).
A lot of their customers usually consist of the College crowd, rarely any "families" that eat there because of the mature-atmosphere.
Waiters/Waitresses are nice, they're always on top on refilling your glass, asking if you need anything, the stuff you see in basically every other sit-down restaurant.
When I went, I had their new Bourbon Burger, it wasn't that great, it tasted like Chili's (ugh) burger with fried onions on it.
Except the Red Robin fryers actually remembered no mayo or tomatoes on my burger (unlike Chili's), so I was very happy about that.
The Bourbon wasn't very flavorful, it was messy, but the picture already shows it's not a clean burger to eat!
Once I added the Red Robin "special seasoning" on it, then it got really good - halfway through the burger...
I did not get the "unlimited steakfries!
" special... but I don't know if it's because our waitress was busy with a large group of college kids who were there for a birthday and simply forgot.
My sister had the Royal Red Robin (with a fried egg on top).
She liked it, but nothing to write home about.
Previously, before the burgers, I would order the Fish and Chips, the fish are nicely fried (can't burn deep fried stuff though huh, lol!
) and crisp.
The Fish itself are very large pieces, so you get the bang for your buck on this item!
I would recommend sharing it with another since you get four pieces of fried fish.
I would defiantly come back to this Red Robin though, don't get me wrong, but I would suggest going with a more adult group that doesn't have a lot of children in tow...
It is more popular with college kids after-all.

Red Robin is always a fun, family-friendly place to grab a burger.
Their new menu has made it even better.
The only reason I can't give them five-stars is because *sometimes* their service is hit-or-miss.

If you're a fan of cheese and mushrooms on your burger, get the pub burger.
And the sweet potato fries are very good too.

I don't like Red Robin.
I was never a fan of their bottomless bland big cut steak fries.
They're plain gross and bland.Burgers, I'd rather go to Wendy's and get their dollar burger!
One night after work me and hubby dint know where to go and I was craving for fish and chips so thought of going to Red Robin for this.
I was surprised to see they have bottomless sweet potato fries!
For an additional of .79c you get endless of this side!
Happy girl!
I'm not sure when did they start having this cuz we don't really frequent this place but I'm glad they have it, I have the sole reason to go back to the place again.
But still only an A-OK rate though, the service was going great until I asked for another order of s.potato fries it took them forever to bring another one, we're already ready to go the time she brought the fries was the same time we gave our card to pay.
Too bad but I still took some of the fries home and munch them the following morning, yeah I know they're kind of soggy but don't blame me I just love sweet potato fries ever.

Delicious fish burger, bottomless steak fries, the best Mai Tai (a large food chain could offer) and great service, what more could you ask for?
Sometimes you'll even catch Red Robin when he makes an appearance.

Once you've been to one Red Robin you've pretty much been to them all.
I've been to this location a few times when visiting family & friends in AZ and everything has always been just fine.
Burgers, salads, appetizers, etc.
are all pretty standard.
Every time I've been here the service has been fine.
Now that I think about it, I think each time I've been here it's been with friends who have small children.
So yeah, this place is good at accommodating kids.
Normally I'd give a place like this three stars, but I'm bumping them to four because of the bottomless fries.
If you order anything on the menu that comes with fries they'll just keep bringing them to you when your out.
The last time I came here me and a friend were waiting on another friend who was running late (because of her kid) and we asked the waitress if she would bring us fries while we waited since we knew most likely somebody was gonna order something that came w/fries, and she had no problem doing so.
Also, even though this isn't a place I would necessarily seek out for watching football they do have several TVs if you happen to be here when a game is on.

What can I say, it is Red Robin!?
It is a chain but it's a good one!
I always ask for Loretta because she is the best server/bartender :)

Who doesn't love Red Robin?
This location is really close to my house, so it's great for those quick dinners when you don't feel like cooking (and lets be honest, that's all the time).
The burgers and chicken tenders (clucks) are usually really good, and the fries are delicious and bottomless.
I especially love the A1 Peppercorn Burger and the Buffalo Clucks.
Sometimes it can be busy and loud with kids and the service can be slow during those times, but it's always a good place for a quick bite.

Top notch burger, the old fashioned way with a sesame seed bun.
All the ingredients were fresh and blended perfectly.
Forget all the other mediocre chains (jack in the box, In and Out, Whataburger, etc.
) and come here - and get a great beer too.

What not to love unlimited fries and great burgers.
I love the milk shake.
I would rather pay $3 more dollars and go to roaring fork.
The prices here are way overpriced for burgers in a plastic basket.
But mighty tasty.
I really want to give four but my index finger wont let me.

Not liking Red Robin is analogous to not liking freedom.
It's a good burger at a good price.
It's family friendly: arcade games, TVs, and the 'Red' bird mascot will bring a smile to people of all ages.
I've gone for many years and I won't be stopping anytime.

Red Robin...Yummmmm!!
From the endless fries option (which J and I never take advantage of) to ordering off menu and getting a custom burger, Red Robin is awesome.
There isn't a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich on the menu.
Sad.
Very Sad.
HOWEVER, the waiter/waitress does magic for the ticket and I always end up with a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich in front of me!
YAY!!
If you don't have one already, be sure to get a Red Loyalty card.
With the registering of this card, you can get a free burger for your birthday!
Gotta love free stuff!

They get five stars now.
You know why?
Three little words I long to hear: Gluten-Free Buns!
(OK, technically that's two words, but I love them nonetheless!
)  The buns are a dollar extra, but if you are like me and are tired of eating a burger with a lettuce wrap, or worse, with cutlery, just for the illusion of a sense of normalcy, they are worth it.
And, frankly, quite tasty.
I don't know if all RR are serving them now, or from the same bakeries/distributors, but I for one am glad for it!

I like RR.
I'm willing to pay the outragious price for some drink with a long name here.
I love the burger choices, the hot wings, the seafood splatter.
Oh and the bottomless Root Beer float!
I love the new Royality Card.
The staff here is very good, some of the best service in AZ.
Which says a lot because AZ is unfortunately known for awful service.

Cause of their bottomless fries!
Need I say more?
I enjoy a good burger and as weird as it sounds Red Robins always seem to satisfy my appetite.
My favorite so far is the Guacamole Burger with bacon --- yum!
Always done right!
The place itself is a zoo with a carnival on the side; babies crying and kids running amuck.
If you can't handle that then I say please stay away!
I always hangout at the bar where there are no kids allowed; good call!
The drinks here are pretty basic and each wait staff has their specialty drink you can order -- cool!
This location is a tad bit noisier I feel since it is closer to the ASU crowd and I gather it's more family oriented because of the marketplace.
Oh well it's just for a quick bite!
- Enjoy!

I love the broiled  burgers are superb.i went at lunch and it was super busy so we sat at bar with quick friendly service.i got the blue cheese burger.great.the onion strings were soggy .but no biggie.i want to go back and try more.and I picked up a there 20 spice blend for 3$.love it.stay classy yelp.

Super sweet waitress!
Free burger for my bday.
My 8 year old daughter loves this place so we'll be back!
I have 12 week old twins and the staff was very accommodating, even opening the door when we arrived and left.
Not bad for a chain restaurant!

The Jack Cantina Burger was excellent.
They use 2 1/8 pound patties, so the portion is smaller than the regular size burgers, however, they are served with bottomless fries.
Also the Mr. Pineapple Beer was excellent.

$16.00 for an ok Burger & Fries, Coke tax and tip - nuff said

This is the FIRST Red Robin I had ever been to (earlier this year).
The service is always really good.
Good Veggie Burgers, love the bottomless fries (garlic & sweet potato), cool shakes and mixed drinks.
One of the few restaurants to stay open late in this town!!!
Great place to come after a movie at Harkins.

Shayenne is the best.. She always hooks up my fries real quick.

For a chain, Red Robin does burgers well.
Prime Chophouse burger.
Service is quick.
A bit loud inside.
$10 burger is worth the visit.

I eat at this location probably once a week and have for quite some time.
The staff at this location are excellent.
They are always so mindful of your time, especially around lunchtime when I don't have all day to sit and wait.
The food is always fresh, hot, and delicious and the restaurant is very clean.
I have used them several times for catering purposes and while I am bummed they don't deliver, it is always great to know that my large orders will be ready on time when I show up to pick them up.
This is my favorite location by far!

Had a fun time at Red Robin in Tempe.
Had the banzai burger w/fries... can't go wrong with any of the burgers or the endless fries!

"As good as it gets" for a chain family restaurant.
I give it 5 stars because for what it is, it does it well.
Food is good, service is very good.
I eat here several times a month and have never had a bad experience.
Servers are always attentive every time I've been there.
It does get busy at times but I've never waited more than 10 minutes for a table.

This is the first time I have ever been here.
I really liked it.
We had a great waiter, but then he was cut and we got a replacement.
Though she also was very good.
Our Burgers were fantastic!
Cooked fully well and very fresh.
Also, our waiter brewed a fresh pot of coffee for me.
Endless fries as well, can you believe that.
They also have this great new program, a royalty program.
Sign me up I can't wait  .
A free Burger the month of your Birthday and for every 9 burgers you get your 10th free.
Clean bathrooms,as I went in there to wash my hands before we ate.
They have a TV in the Floor near the waiting area,which I have never seen before.
I thought it was really Cool!

As I have said before, I'm not a big fan of chains.
Red Robin is one exception however.
It's a great burger for a decent price with as many fries as you can eat.
What's not great about that?!?
I'm mean really.
I've been to several locations around various states.
The service at this location was above the standard.
My waitress went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and happy.
I really appreciated the extra attention to detail.
I'll be hitting up this location again in the near future.

Your typical family burger place.
The wait staff is usually friendly and efficient.
The food is ok, I recommend the garlic fries they are bottomless.
It is usually a bit on the noisy side.

We were served by Cheyenna.
She was pleasant and upbeat, which seems to be the norm for servers at Red Robin.
The food is always good, and one of the few places where I don't have to force my son to eat the food that I give him (he's 2).
Always a fun atmosphere.
Recommend to anyone who is looking for a cheap lunch or dinner that is quick, but doesn't feel like you're being rushed.
Enjoy!!

Of the three Red Robin locations nearby, this one is probably the least clean, and the least consistent as far as service goes.
It is the closest to home though, but we often opt for Tempe Market Place or the Red Robin out at Chandler Fashion Mall.

Yeah a solid burger and fries joint - some tasty looking milkshake options too if you happen to want to bump your meal up another thousand calories.
Got a slightly tweaked bacon guacamole burger with the bottomless fries (awesome!
) and would go again to try another variation (and sweet pot fries this time..)

We have been to this place a few times now.
So it is safe to say I really like it!
Endless fries for starters, then really good Burgers.
So worth the trip.
They even send you emails about all the great deals that they have going on.
The thing I really like about that is you do not have to print coupons they have it all downloaded on your rewards card.
So I think they really care more about the environment with that because, no ink and no paper wasted.
A really good Idea!
Staff is always friendly and nice,even when you call on the phone.
The place is clean and the food is good.
They even made me nice fresh coffee the other day.
My most fun part here is the TV in the floor, I am really amused by that.
Clean bathrooms and lots of parking.

I haven't been to this Red Robin in a while, and I came back with a friend of mine this afternoon to meet up for some food.
What a good time!
It was busy for a Sunday afternoon, but fortunately we didn't have to wait.
We were seated in the bar area and our server greeted us promptly.
We already had the menu's at our table, and after scouring it, I went with the fries.
My friend went with a chicken salad, and I her sister went with the fish and chips.
Overall, our food was tasty, and I really had a good time.
While we were busy gabbing, our server always refilled our drinks, and after I bill came we had our bill split.
She was friendly and nice, and I really enjoyed our time here.
I will say, the handicapped bathroom was out of service when I was there, and it was a bit messy and needed attention overall.
Nothing horrendous, but could have used someone to go in there and clean up the towels on the floor and mop some.
Overall a positive experience and I had a good time.
Will be back when I'm in the area again!
Oh, and happy hour all Sunday long!

Was here with my wife and son today.
Never been to a Red Robin before so this was a treat.
Food was pretty decent and staff was nice.
They had the air conditioner blasting so was not very comfortable.
But we live in Arizona so that is a common occurance.

What's the point of the Red Robin cards if when you walk in the waiters get to decide that they're "expired"?
Note: there isn't an expiration date anywhere on the cards.
We refused service and left.
It was a gift card from my mom by the way.

We have been here a few times now.
Sorry to say this was the worst we have experienced.
It was a Tuesday night, about 8:30pm.
Not too busy when we got there.
We had to say hello to the hostess, she just said later, how you doing, (2).
She never said follow me,or is this table alright.
Just put our menus down and said enjoy!
When our Server Rachel came up,she was alright,she brought us our drinks right away.
We waited quite awhile for our food, the manager finally brought it out to us.
Then asked if we needed anything.
Both of our drinks were empty.
We asked for refills.Rachel brought them.
About 15 min or more later she came by to ask if we liked our food.
My girlfriend had ordered hers well done,it was still very pink in the middle.
They offered to re do she declined.
We all know never send food back.
She said no it is OK, I just want you to see it is not cooked.
Mine was cooked all the way through.
Even though I had ordered Medium.
Anyway, then the manager came by again.
Though did not introduce himself as the manager at any time.
We found out from Rachel that he was.
Again he offered a re cook.
She declined and said no ,it is fine.
I will take it home to the dog.
He offered to take it off the bill.
We still never got another refill of drinks, we were dying of thrist so could hardly wait to get home and get some water or out to the car where we had water bottles.
Lots of milling around by the employees,but not too much going on on the floor.
We were really disappointed about this visit.

Steer clear of the Prime rib dip, stick to burgers and chicken sandwiches.
Advice from a very helpful server.
Do that and the food is great!

Came here for dinner with the wife, the service was great and the burgers were good.
I really enjoyed myself here, I will likely return to this restaurant.

So this was my first time eating at Red Robin ever..... yes I said ever......
I was really excited to see that they had a mushroom burger on their menu!
Not a lot of places have mushroom burgers so I was super excited to try it.
When our food came out my burger was cooked to my specifications, but the taste of the burger and the mushrooms was very dull.
I felt like there was no flavor or pizazz to the burger.
With all the mushrooms, onions and cheese I figured this burger would be making my taste buds jump around.
Instead it did the complete opposite.
I ate a few bites and decided to just visit with my friend and munch on my fries.
My fries were cold and kind of mushy.
When I eat french fries, I like them crispy and warm.
A lot of my friends love this place, so I will give it another try, just not a very good first impression.
Maybe if I order something else I will have better luck!
I usually try to give new places more than one shot just on that occasional off day we all have every now and then.

I hadn't been to Red Robin in years, and it will probably be years before we go back.
Pretzel bites were hard.
The taste of the mushroom burger was just weird.
Fries weren't great.
The onion rings were ok, but more breaded than battered.
They did sub out pretzel buns on our burgers for us - and the campfire sauce is tasty - but alas, not enough to make me return.

I come here every year on my birthday for a free burger.
It's a toss up if your going to get good service but for the most part it's usually good.
A few times I have been they take forever to get your drinks and take your order other times it's very quickly.
With any restaurant this can happen.
I always get the whiskey river burger it's my favorite.
Bottomless fries?
Yes please!
Also love the tower of onion rings and sauces that come with it.
If your into a big burger sign up for the loyalty card and get a free one on your birthday!
P.s.
The red robin mascot is creepy in my opinion sometimes walks around the restaurant and makes me uneasy.
But then again I don't like clowns either.

Bummer visit.
Went on a Saturday night but it was late enough to avoid the really big crowds.
Got a table in 10 mins.
Asked for a gluten free menu, which Red Robin is really good at.
My wife ordered a GF burger, no onions, no cheese and a side salad instead of fries.
I ordered the prime rib dip with fries and cole slaw.
We also asked for silverware and napkins since they were missing.
Our order arrived in about 10 mins, still no napkins or silverware.
Got those after five more mins.
My wife's burger had onions (no cheese) but the biggie: her salad had croutons!
Really?
The server had even asked if she preferred a GF bun or if she was gluten allergic.
I SAW him write down allergic!
My sandwich was tasty but they were obviously getting rid of stale bread.
I know the difference between toasted and stale too.
Good thing I had the au jus.
Lastly, my endless fries and bottomless lemonade?
Never saw the waiter again until he brought us the bill.
I'm done with that Red Robin.
Obviously they don't care.

You can never go wrong at Red Robin.
I mean how could you?
There's bottomless fries, either steak fries or sweet potato fries.
And also mouth watering burgers.
Have been to multiple locations around the valley and the service is always great and never a long waiting time.
If you're in a crunch for time you can also call ahead and order your food and it will be ready by the time you are seated at your table.
I would recommend this if you have a shorter lunch break.
My favorites items are the Whiskey River Burger, Whiskey River Chicken Sandwich and Whiskey River Chicken Wrap.
I guess I'm a big fan of their BBQ sauce.
Not to mention they have the best ranch amongst all restaurants.
Lastly, I recommend the berry lemonade to compliment the food.
This is also bottomless so drink up and get one to go!

On May 2, 2013 a group of friends and I came here to grab a burger before a movie.
Four of us became incredibly ill only hours after eating here and we were all sick for 3-4 days afterward.
Two of the other members who came with us did not get ill.
Apologies, I would have written something more timely, but just getting around to it now.
I've eaten at other Red Robin's before and never had an issue.
It appears it's just this location.

I am sitting here now!
I'm only giving this place 2 stars because the waiter is nice.
First as we walk in the door we noticed dirty tables everywhere and it isn't even that busy.
Second, we order an app and it was served with a dirty plate.
When I asked for a 2nd plate that as well was dirty.
I gave up and just ate with my fingers.
Third, I ordered a chop house medium rare and got a chophouse medium well.
Sigh!
My husband got the A-1 burger which he thought was ok. Over all we did enjoy the fried mushrooms and fried zucchini.
The waiter was friendly and the service was fast.
The water taste like tap water and the beer was good.
I don't think id return here :(

Best gluten free buns ever.
Honestly, if you're cutting it out for health reasons or just trying to eat well, check out the gluten free buns!
They even do the fries in a separate fryer, which I appreciate.

We come often because of the gluten free options.
We have eaten there several times and never gotten sick.
It is for sure the family favorite and I find the staff here a bit better than some of the other locations.

Been to 5 Red Robins, this is probably the worst one I have managed to go to, but its not a bad place for a quick dinner with friends or a Burger.
Food always come out slower than expected, even when its almost empty, I have had to wait 20+ minutes.
Few times I have gotten coffee, never been asked if I want cream or sugar.

Been here a few times and every time, the service seemed very slow...  Looks like there's plenty of people moving about but no service was being given.
The food wasn't too bad.
The bottomless fries were fine.
Once I even substituted for bottomless broccoli.
Of all the typical burger places with this kind of atmosphere, this place can do better.
Last time, I ordered a Chili Chili Burger and there was barely any chili on it even though on the menu, it was painting an image of a lot of chili on this awesome hamburger.
Turns out, it was just a hamburger.

As good as it wss in 69 in Seattle.
Very pleasantly surpried.
Ordered the cheese burger with sweet potato fries.
The fries were so good I ate them without catsup.
The short srack onion rings were best ever and the burger was thick juicy and done right.
The provolone on top was melted into the burger like it should be.
Service was outstanding.
This is a burger place, not a chicken place, so order burgers.
Kind of like ordering American in a Chinese place, not a good idea.

Every time we come here it's always so good!
Granted when they are slammed we may have to wait a few mins longer but hey would would you expect !
Always fun and everyone is always so friendly!

My sister and I took our two nieces and nephew tonight.
We haven't been in awhile and now I remember why.
Everything we ate - two appetizers and our dinners - were loaded with salt.
It was awful.
I had ordered the fried cod - terribly salty.
When I peeled the coating away, the fish itself was delicious.
The server was friendly and efficient, which was great.

Me n the wifey were craving a nice juicy burger so we came here to Red Robins....not too shabby....very busy when we got here.....our burgers were cook to perfection.....the service was top notch....especially our server.....great gal.
We were stuffed....we both ate just half our burgers.
Lol

This was the worse red robin I have ever been to.
The waitress was nice but the manager was really rude.
I came to red robin to get a free burger for my birthday with my red royalty card.
I didn't register the card until this morning which I called and asked if it was Ohkay to use.
Someone on the phone said I could use it as long as I bring my id, which I did.
The manager didn't do anything about the issue.
All he said was it takes 24 hours to active and I could get use it sometime this month.
Why would I want to come to red robin again within the same month?
Maybe this place needs to replace the manager if they want people to come there.

I should have read the reviews before choosing this place.
Shame on me.
I felt like we were at a day care facility that happened to serve awesome burgers.
Crying babies, unruly toddlers, older children literally running down the aisles, inattentive parents and unbelievable amount of NOISE.
Unfortunately no matter how tasty and reasonably priced their burgers are, we will never return to this locale.
Not slamming the establishment, just letting others know.

Red Robin is a great standard burger.
You can't go wrong and they have stepped up their game from a kiddie place with balloons, to a more of adult bar.
They are one of the rare (pun) places that will cook a burger the way I like it - RARE!
This one's good and near ASU so expect eye candy.

The family and I stopped by for father's day and I had the best burger experience in my life.
I'm originally from California and I consider my self to be a burger connoisseur.
I've had them all from in n out to The Hat.
Long story short I know a good burger when I eat one.
At Red Robin I ordered a Red Robin classic cheese burger with an onion bun, crispy straw onions instead of regular onions, meat cooked well done and also my must have ketchup.
After taking my first bite I knew that this was the burger of the year.
This burger was perfect in every aspect.
The bun to meat ratio was perfect, the onion bun also gave me a softer more flavourful alternative from your standard sesame seed bun.
The crispy straw onions added a nice texture to the burger as it complemented the lettuce, tomatoes, relish, mayo, and ketchup.
This Red Robin is taking the crown for best burger of the year in my book.
I look forward to getting back to California and trying the same burger to see if quality and taste are comparable.
And last but not least I would like to thank my waitress Kayla M. for serving us she is really nice, friendly, and if you get a chance check out this Red Robin.

like always the burger taste great in red robin , but the table was so dirty and sticky.
we cleaned the table using some of our baby pampers tissue and it tuned black :(
