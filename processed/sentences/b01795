02.08.10  I don't know why I almost always end my trip reviews with a bad one on a fast food restaurant at the airport.
This is no different.
Seriously, I know life sucks when you work at a fast food restaurant at the airport.
If you don't want to work there, maybe you should find another job.
It's definitely not good for business when you have a sour look on your face while you point me to another cashier because you don't feel like taking my order.
I did get an extra piece of nugget.
In your face.

How can you not like Wendy's?

Located in the T-4 D gates this is the place to stop for your super large super cheap iced coffee.
I also like picking up a snack or small breakfast sandwich depending on the time of day I am rolling through here.
Having over anticipated the time I needed to get through security I had plenty of time to walk from my C gate to the D gates to pick up something.
I have had no porblems with the service or food quality on the couple of stops I have made at this Wendy's.

I was starved and Wendy's was the only fast food that was quick and easy in between my flights.
Unfortunately, the line was super long and they only had 1 register open.
I had an hour to spare, so I was willing to wait for hot food.
Luckily, the line went quick.
But, what I don't get is how there is only 1 cashier, 1 runner, and a ton of people working in the back kitchen.
I was baffled...
The cashier told me the wrong number so I was waiting for my order while other people's orders behind me came and went.
When I questioned my order and conveyed what number I was given, they claimed that they didn't even have that number in the system.
Perhaps I just made up a number of my own and wanted to wait for my food...
Really?

Typical Wendy's grub.
Certainly better than BK and McD's but still nothing to write home about...
I bumped the rating up a star (2 to 3) simply because of the location, fast service and reasonable prices (for an airport).
Expect 2 star food with 3 star service in an airport, but nothing more.

Charged for a #6 instead of a #1.
Price difference $.60.
I receive $.30 back.
Thank you, unhappy manager.
