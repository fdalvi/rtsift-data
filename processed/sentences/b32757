Vegas Henna is wonderful to work with.
Excellent artistic skill, lovely personality, flexible scheduling and a fair price!
I hosted a bridal henna party at my home - was so easy working with Vegas Henna and we were all very happy with our designs.

I first met Melissa of Vegas Henna at my girlfriends baby shower, not knowing much about Henna.
She did a beautiful job on my girlfriend's growing belly as well as did designs on all of the guests at the shower too.
I have since seen her 3 more times at her 1st Friday booth and each time got a different design.
She's friendly and easy to work with.
Oh, and make sure to check out her Solar Lanterns and other merchandise that she has decorated (super cute!

First met Melissa about 3 years ago.
My sister found her and she was able to come to our hotel and take care of the 3 of us.
Have seen Melissa several times since.
I get more compliments from her work than anyone else when I am back home.
Her technique allows my design to last almost two weeks.
I give her the choice of what she will do and I love that it is all free hand.
Can not wait to be in Vegas in September and hopefully we will see Melissa again.

Another awesome henna design from Vegas Henna at the Las Vegas Belly Dance Intensive!
I have never been disappointed with her work.
I like to just give her a price point and let her do what she wants to my hand.
If you're around where she's vending (Streeats, First Friday, etc.
) give her a try.
