Marshalls looks like a traditional, older fashioned jewellery store from the exterior but you may be pleasantly surprised.
I had mistakingly thought it looked a bit outdated, but they've got some lovely, delicate looking rings for as little as a tenner, Ortak necklaces and an interesting collection of second hand gold charms.
A lot of their styles will appeal to older generations, but there are contemporary pieces if you look hard enough.
Marshalls is also a functioning store that polishes, mends, customises pieces and engraves on request.
The business is a Jack of all trades in that respect, but for the casual browser there are both timeless, modern and unusual trinkets to suit a variety of clinetele.

I agree with Marj, I was pleasantly surprised by this place.
The staff were very nice and helped me look for a fake gift for my fake aunt, which if she existed she would be very happy.
There was a tonne of beautiful second hand jewelry that I'm glad someone salvaged from Cash for Gold's evil furnace.
Hope this place doesn't get swallowed by the bigger retail chains.

Are you stuck on a gift for a special lady- friendly?
Does this lady-friend like jewerly?
Is your budget under 20 pounds?
My love-struck friend Neil thinks Marshals is a saviour.
He says that the people in there is also very helpful with choosing a piece, without being scronful about it.
Although the stuff he bought for his lady friend is not my cup of tea as far as bling goes, she loves it and is happy, so that means the seas are calm, making us all happy and drama-free.
(for now anyways).
