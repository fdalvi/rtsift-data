The husband came here on our wedding day to get his hair cut.
They took great care of him and used shears so he wouldn't look like ...well like he got a haircut on him wedding day.
Everyone here is great and while I sit here and wait for him to get done, everyone walking out looks good too.

Friendly staff and feels like "the barber shop" movie with ice cube and the Korean Lady...:) but they all great.
Kind of pricy at $18 but quality is good.
Beats driving to base for me.
The setting is a little boring and they could use an interior designer just to have some sort of sports theme, but I think that's the only thing they're missing.
No ticketing system either, so a little unorthodox.
I'd still come here versus other places.

Went recently to barber in the back of the shop.
Received a good cut.
Will be back.
Gary did my hair

Came in today on short notice, Mike was able to get me sat quickly which was great.
Good people, sports TVs, and a good cut.
Definitely will be back.

I come here with my son, I call in advance to get in and get out.
This is a modern day place, good music and tv.
Everyone is very polite.
My son 5 yr old doesn't want to go anywhere else's.
I get a straight edge on my head and face and live it.
Good location too!
