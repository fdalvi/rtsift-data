Okay, I've gave this place a try two times.
First time was great with the discount I received as a first time customer.
You get a haircut, shampoo, chair massage, and hot face towel for about 20 bucks plus tip.
The second time I went now that I moved to Las Vegas, and this is the closest place to get a guy's haircut.
The lady that cut my hair didn't really know how to cut an Asian guys hair...
I've was waiting in line in the lobby, and noticed they get a lot of Air Force guys coming in and getting a buzz cut like G.I Joe.
Kinda reminds me when I used to go to my NEX (Navy Exchange barber shop inside the base when I was in the Navy).
I was disappointed with my hair when I left.
I asked for a trim off the top, but she cut my hair really short!
I guess I'm spoiled because I used to go to Korean hair salons in Los Angeles to get my hair cuts lol.
So for now, I'm still searching for a nice place to get a haircut as an Asian guy...

Just got the worst haircut in my 49 years on planet Earth.
This includes the ones my Mom gave me when I was a kid.
The girl that attempted to cut my hair had no idea what she was doing.
She took about 20 snips at my hair ( about 3 minutes) spun me around and asked me how I liked it.
What a joke.
Trust me on this.
Do not go any where near this place.

Extremely slow unprofessional and ghetto.
Bad at cutting hair too go to the one at Decatur and 215 instead.
