Best, most fun market in the Valley!

-Thieves Market is a mini Flea Market with vintage treasures, jewelry, yard sale stuff, and misc.
artisan vendors in a small dirt lot.
-Held the first Saturday of each month (I think?
It's not real clear on their website).
-Monthly event is from 8am - 3pm (Again, not posted on their website, maybe I found this info on their FB page?
)  -$1 for admission  -Get there early, parking can be a real hassle.
-There was a (greasy) food truck on site.
-Since it's held in an empty lot, there is a port-a-potty located nearby...so, don't drink lots of coffee before you go.
-There are like 4-5 gas stations along the 12 mile drive along Cave Creek from the 101 if you need a restroom, gas, or whatever...plus, a McDonald's a few miles from the 101 on Cave Creek (east side of the road).
-It is located: 6070 E. Valley Way.
Go to their website for map and directions.
-I liked it, I would go again.
I found some cool vintage stuff at really good prices.

My first time here, although I live here.
A bit pricier than a yard sale, but lots of crafts and vintage.
A fun way to spend the day for a buck, and didn't see anyone selling what I consider junk.
Another treasure in Cave Creek Az

Not impressed - there were 2 people there who didn't have southwest stuff or run of the mill garage sale/craft show stuff.
We walk slow and were back to our car in less than 10 minutes.
I wasn't much impressed with the rest of Cave Creek AZ either - so if that's your thing, this might work out better for you.
