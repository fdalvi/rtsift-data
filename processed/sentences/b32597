I'm an adult and I would love to come here!
My 7 year old needed a yearly cleaning and X-rays.
They were so nice and enjoyable, tv's, video games, toys!!
Great service and they did a awesome job on my sons teeth.
After they took great care of my son, we ended up having to have oral surgery there.
It was also a great experience!
They were so nice and careful with my little dude.
He was back on his feet the next day.
Thank you so much for being cool.
We will be back.

Can't give a review.
Accidental check in.
No pun intended...

They are amazing!
I took both my daughter 3 and my son 6 and they had a awesome experience.
The staff is friendly and the dentist is very nice and informative!
My husband and I were allowed to come in and see exactly what was going to be done.
We had a horrible experience at tiny teeth and they fixed the problem right away.
My daughter even had a "wiggle" ( tooth taken out) with no problems!
I would recommend.
This place to anyone!
