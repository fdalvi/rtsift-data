This transfer terminal is in a good location.
You can catch the SDX, the Deuce, the 109, 117, 217, 212, 402, and the 104.
If you are heading to the airport and don't want  to pay for garage or economy you can park your car here for free and take the 109 to the airport for $2.
Don't like parking/ driving on the strip?
Park here and hop on the SDX, you can catch a free ride like many people do on the SDX just watch out for workers checking for passes.
The SSTT has a nice lobby with clean restrooms, plenty of chairs and tables, vending machines, and security that watches the parking lot.
Only complaint I have is that a lot of people utilize the free parking and sometimes you can not find an available spot

This place is pretty convience for myself to get to from school.
The 109 bus goes directly here with stop in between of course.
I find it to be extra convience for people traveling from other cities in and out where the buses do take folks to the strip and the airport.
Also for faster transport, there are taxis.
Each bay is designated for a specific bus.
I tend to use Megabus so it has been always at the same bay.
Side note, there are vending machines and public restrooms.

First this place was hard to find.. not even the taxi driver knew of it.. but once I called information we weren't that far away..
It's actually right on the outskirts of the airport ( not in the airport) Outside across the street and gage from the airport.
We wanted to arrive early to obtain good seats.... we should have listened when they said don't arrive to 30-45 minutes early..
THERE IS NOTHING HERE.. it is strictly a bus depot, with the characters you except to see, the homeless, the trying to get home, the runaways - speaking of ... there was entire wall just dedicated to run a away children.. well that just ruined my weekend.
There are only a few tables inside and vending machines...I was thrilled with the bathroom either only because you could enter the woman's' and men's' very easily , there was no door.. it was a 2 way entry so anyone could grab you as you walked in.
It's not that bad if you are only waiting for about 30 minutes, but for the 3 hours early we did it was a horrible...
I will return again since this is where you catch the MegaBus back to Los Angeles, just only 15 minutes before departure.

I didn't want to give this place five stars because the majority of my reviews lately are either five stars or one star and that could start to look a little manic: love it!
hate it!
love it!
hate it!
truth is often somewhere in the middle, no?
anyway, in spite of that, I'm giving this place five stars even though I don't want to and this is why:  free long term parking 10 minutes and a $2 bus ride away from the airport.
the long term parking lot is just two blocks north of south strip terminal .
I left my car there for 8 days - no problem, and it seems secure enough.
I called after 7 days to make sure they wouldn't tow it - once I got the number (not the easiest thing in the world and I forget what it was, sorry.
) I reached a security guard who cheerfully told me not a problem.
I don't think they were going to tow it on the 8th day anyway, but I wanted to make sure.
Can't beat the price (free) location (ten minutes away) or the shuttle to the airport (catch the 109 bus at the terminal two blocks south of where you park in stalls 17 and 18. bring $2 in cash, exact change.
it comes roughly every 20 minutes)  Off the top of my head I can't think of another airport that has a free airport parking set up like this one.

This place seems like the middle of nowhere but actually has great connectors to the strip and downtown.
You can take an RTC bus or Duce bus for $8.00 all day pass to the strip, Duce goes all the way to Freemont Street, runs every 15 min until 12:30.
The busses start again at 8:00 for RTC and Duce is 9:00.
Purchase the tickets at kiosk in terminal, credit or cash.
They have restrooms open 24hrs but that's it after 8:00.
I was there at 11:00 waiting for Megabus for 12:30 and kind of creepy late night, I didn't see any security around.
If you hang out in the terminal until the bus arrives it's heated and well light.
