Very professional staff and clean facility.
I actually hadn't given blood in over a year because the location that was convenient for me (McClintock and McDowell) had closed and this location just seemed too far.
Fortunately, the good people at UBS will frequently give you a courtesy call if they have your number.
Quick and painless.
Now that I'm back on track, I'll continue to come here for my donations.

Great service but their system in AZ sucks.
Why do you have to call a toll free number in Scottsdale to make an appointment in Goodyear???
Makes no sense.
In NV they list each location phone number so you can talk direct to where you want to go--not in AZ.
You have to talk to several people to make an appointment or get to talk to a location your interested in.
