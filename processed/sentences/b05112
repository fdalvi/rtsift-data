Went to this Arbys a few days ago because I was craving the Ultimate Angus (Three Cheese and Bacon) sandwich.
The advertised picture of this sandwich looks amazing.
Well to my surprise, once I received my sandwich, it looked like a totally different item.
The bread was even different.
It was horrible.
I know food doesnt always look as advertised but this was not even close.

As usual they slop a whole bunch of secret sauce so you can't taste the beef or the rest of the sandwich.
I had the new advertised Rueben and sure wasn't impressed.

This is our second time at Arby's for the King's Hawaiian sandwiches, we typically don't frequent Arby's very often but these sandwiches have brought us back twice in a month which is unheard of.
The service was okay, the food was good, the fries were hot.
Would I drive across town for Arby's?
No, but just down the street is fine with me.
4 stars because this happens to be a location with competent staff, fresh curly fries, and a soda machine that was well stocked.
What more could you ask for?

Our food was served fresh and fast!
Amongst our group, we had an apple turnover which has delicious frosting, jalepeno poppers, Reubens, a roast beef sandwich, a couple of shakes, and fries.
They only had one apple turnover left so we had to split one.
The chocolate shake was really a vanilla shake with chocolate syrup squirted in for decoration.
The rest of the food was incredible!
Totally bummed about the shake and turnover..... Maybe next time.

The cashier was extremely efficient.
He got my order right the first time without making me repeat anything at the drive thru window.
After he gave me my total, I made the decision to add a bottle of that fabulous Arby's Sauce they now sell by the bottle!
Heaven!!
He told me he would have my updated total at the window.
When I got to the window and he gave me the total, I asked if that included the bottle of sauce.
He responded, "I'll take care of it.
" He then gave me the bottle for free!
Oh yes!
I'll be back!
