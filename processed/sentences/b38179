Excellent pizza, also had sampler platter and the sauce was excellent, the pizza could have used a bit more sauce, but still great.
Friday night crowded, but it's a small place.
Staff was friendly and apologized for wait.
Had our two-year old with us and they brought him a little bag of goldfish during our wait time.
Love the loyalty program, definitely can't be beat!
Only thing I noticed is that the online menu didn't match the menu in the restaurant.... Kind of a bummer since the pasta online sounded very good, not as many choices in person.... That's the only reason for the 4/5 rating.

Love, love, love this place.
Great food and the absolute best White Pizza!!!!

My husband and I got pizza here about 2 weeks ago.
The pizza was just ok.
There didn't seem to be enough sauce so it had a dry taste.
The restaurant seemed nice and the staff was very friendly.
I think next time we will try one of their other dishes.

We love almost everything about Angelo's, from the delicous food to the completely remodeled space to the outdoor patio to the warm and welcoming staff.
Actually, that's in the wrong order- it's the staff that keep us coming back week after week.
Every time we're there, I know that they truly appreciate that we've come in do dine with them, and they do their part to make sure we have a good experience.

Food was great,fast, and staff was friendly.
Even got us food not on the menu cause it was fish fry Friday.
Would go there again if we lived closer!
The Cajun shrimp app was delish and our waitress was beyond helpful
