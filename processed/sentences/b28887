My boyfriend checked out this cute little shop in downtown Glendale while on the hunt for my Christmas presents.
He scored a CHI straightener for $75.
They have unique jewelry and lots of Marilyn Monroe merchandise.
A nice independent local store!

Great shop!
It's so much fun to hear shoppers say the name "happy hippie"; it makes me happy just to hear it!
Very helpful, attentive staff.
They do consignment now- ladies, bring them your clothes, shoes and accessories!!!
Watch them on Facebook for evening events: promotions, open mic nights, etc.
It's wonderful!

LOVED this place.
Cute apparel & REALLY cute earrings & accessories at great pricing.

I love this place.
The happy hippie offers comfort, style, and quality rolled into one.

Awesome boutique.
Fairly inexpensive.
I love love their pumpkin spice soy candles and all their incense make my apartment smell so good!
Cute clothes and very friendly associates.
Many of the surrounding stores aren't very nice so they were a breath of fresh air

I love shopping at this store.
I always get great dresses that are comfy and decently priced.
They also have a great selection of preowned clothes in the back too.
The acessories and fab as well.
I love their selection of earrings and someone they work with or know makes these awesome leather cuffs.
They have paintings, incense, candles and so much more.
They ladies that work there are great helpers while shopping and super nice to talk to as well!
