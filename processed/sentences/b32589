I got the beef doner plate.
It was ok, but not particularly flavourful.
Also, I didn't really feel filled up after I left.
But, like, ok, at the end of the day.

Love me some Rana.
The chicken doner wrap is the best IMO

Quick and cheap middle eastern food, and surprisingly good for the price.
The chicken donair is great, and the baklava is good enough.
Grab the donair plate if you're looking for more value, though the pita is good for lunch.

I always get the same thing when I order at Rana: Chicken donar plate with extra rice and salad, no fries.
This dish is delicious, and big enough to eat for two lunches in a row.
Tastes great warm and cold, and the service is always fast, even if there is a line.
My only complaint is that depending on who is on cash, sometimes they will let me get extra rice and salad in place of fries while other times, they will only let me get extra salad.
Not sure what the big deal is there, since rice, salad, and fries are all pretty equivalent in terms of how much they cost to produce.
However, that's a pretty small gripe...

Colleague: "What do you want for lunch?
"  Me: "Meat.
"  Colleague:"...Rana?
"  Me: "Yup.
"  That is how most conversations are carried out just before deciding on going to Rana for lunch.
Usually I order the chicken doner, no onions, and it will taste exactly as I expect it to taste: meaty, filling, and delicious.
