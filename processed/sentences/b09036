Twila's Barbershop is a family operated business in the heart of, South Scottsdale.
If your looking to get a great haircut at a reasonable price this is the place to go!
Great environment for everybody at any age.
Go give them a try you won't be let down, guaranteed.

Berry berry nice!!

Another 5 star review.
Davin knows how to cut hair.
Medium fade from a 2 to "just enough to let me push up the front" and he nailed it.
Good old fashioned normal barber shop for those that prefer rockin in public to rock and republics.
every 2 weeks from here on out.

I can't say enough about Twila's!
Best barber shop in town.
Family owned and full of character!
The haircuts are amazing and there is always some good conversation to have while your waiting or in the seat.
Twila or her on Davin have always cut my hair and it is fantastic every time!
I recommend Twila's to everyone I know.
Why waste your money on a chain when you can invest in the locally owned business like Twila's!

Excellent shop where I have been going  for 10 plus years.
I drive 7 miles and would drive 17 past many others because they make me look great.

I've been getting my hair cut here for almost 20 years.
Three generations of this family have cut my hair over the years.
Always a great haircut, which is often difficult because I have such thick hair.
A very nice mother/son operating the shop now.

Get a hair cut and a nice close shave.
I like the shaving cream warmer.
