If I could give JSM Properties zero stars, I certainly would.
The staff is totally incompetent and does not appear to care at all about the safety and well-being of their tenants.
We have been poisoned with carbon monoxide three times since renting from them, and not until after we called the building inspector did they make any effort to replace the furnace.
During the process of replacing the furnace, they failed to take any precautionary measures to prevent drywall dust from accumulating all over every inch of the apartment, and then failed to clean it up, leaving us living in hazardous conditions for over a week now, and I seriously doubt that the conditions will improve as they refuse to do anything to remedy the situation besides offer us a free sandwich at Jimmy Johns.
Unacceptable.
TL;DR: If you need any maintenance done, you are f**ked

JSM caters mostly to college students, but for the companies available to college students, they weren't that bad.
They were fair on our security deposit, replaced things as we needed them, and the place was much more livable that other places that my friends were in.

I love renting from JSM.
The staff is very friendly and accommodating, prices are reasonable for madison rates (which are terrible), and they are always quick to deal with any service requests I have.
I live at the Firehouse and our ceilings are crazy high so when a light bulb is out or we need to get the cobwebs cleaned I always have to call, they always send a person in 24 hours (yesterday they sent someone the same day).
As well as great customer service, they always have events going on at their offices for their renters.
some of the event include free food or items, others are things like a march madness bracket competition or taking surveys for a chance at free rent or groceries.
All in all as a college student property management they are stellar!
