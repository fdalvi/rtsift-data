So last week we get a flyer for this place, it was actually put inside of our Lilac planter by our front door.
We decided to give this place a try.
We got a pizza (veggie with no tomatoes), a side salad, two liter of Diet Pepsi, and two large cookies for $20.
That was with delievery.
The pizza was very good.
The dough was just right, not to thick or thin.
When it arrived it smelled wonderful.
It was very good.
I am a person who does not like a lot of sauce on her pizza, so when a place does not totally cover the dough with five ladels of sauce I am happy.
I even usually say light sauce.
We did not tell this place that, and the amount of sauce was perfect.
So I would order from this place agian.

Like the other poster we received a flyer stating if it isn't the best they will refund the money.
So we tried it.
Got the pie and it wasn't cooked.
I called them and informed them of the situation.
The individual said he would refund the money.
I said no need just give us another pizza next time we call.
He said that was great and gave me his name.
Win- Win both I thought.
A few weeks later I called the same number and informed the person of the deal and she would have to talk to someone about it.
She said she would call back which she did- there was no person by the name I was given.
I asked for a manager and she gave me the number to call to talk to some one- which I did and was told the managers were gone until the next morning.
So I called another number asked for a manager.
He came on the phone and I explained the situation- he said there was no person by that name.
by this time I was so irritated that it took 4 phone calls over a $20 items.
He said he would give another pizza, but I didn't want to go thru the hassle again and declined.
So if your pie is bad and want a refund ,.
expect a interrogation and lots of inconvenience in getting.

This location is out of business.
