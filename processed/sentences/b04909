There always seem to be sales when i walk in here.
Customer service is usually ok though Ive had a couple of visits where its been spotty.
Sign up with their list on website & get coupons!

Evertime I come in there sees to be a sale!
Clothes are cute and is one of the few places that I found that has skinny/slims that fit my 5 year old with a 4t waist but a 6 in length with out having to sinch the waist in so much that it looks rediculas from the back.
