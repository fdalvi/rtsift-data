One time I think I was really sad.
And when I'm really sad...I eat a lot.
I ordered a Mexican pizza with lots of meat - and cheese and mexican stuff.
I ordered chicken wings....and garlic bread.......and a calzone.....yea it was big.
Yea I ate a lot of it.
Yea....it was good.
Moreso average.
But....yea I was sad.

This pizza is like all of the other chains dominos, papa johns.
If your looking for good or desent food go somewere else
