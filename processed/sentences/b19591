See Tracy for an awesome fill and Chris will give you the BEST pedicure!
Their prices are the best in town, specially the pedicures which are 40% OFF (which ends up being around $15 for standard pedi).

Very nice ladies.
I would recommend them to any of my friends.
Cheap!
$17.50 spa pedicure with nail polish included.

This is my go to place whenever I'm in Vegas.
Tracy is the owner, and she is amazing!
I've gotten to the point where I only see Tracy for any of my waxing services.
I love her, she's gets my eyebrows just how I like them unlike other places who like to thin out the eyebrows.
She's also amazing for any nail/mani/pedi services, but I think all of her staff do a fine job.

I'm really reluctant about giving out 5 stars to any business.
If I do they have to be top notch, the best of the best.
At Queen Nails they are the best nail salon I've ever been to!
I usually like doing my own pedicures solely because when I go places to get pedicures, I don't know if I'm the only one who feels like this, but the person doing my pedicure seem to always be rushing the pedicure & a little too rough & careless about how they scrub & cut my nails.
Sometimes it even hurts.
Not only that but the manicurist are ALWAYS talking to each other.
It makes me feel uncomfortable & I assume they're talking crap.
BUT here they seriously are so professional!
My manicurist name was PETER.
He's the sweetest guy ever!
I was reading a few reviews & someone said that it was "quiet" in there.
I wasn't sure what she meant until I got there.
Quiet as in they keep the talking to a minimum so it doesn't feel like they're talking crap about you or anyone in the store at all.
& your manicurist talks to you just enough talking so you feel comfortable with them.
& the pedicure itself didn't feel rushed at all.
He took his time & the only time I twitched was when he was scrubbing my foot softly because it was a ticklish spot.
Plus a hot stone foot massage?!
YES!
Thank you.
This place is seriously the most professional, clean & affordable nail salon I have ever been to.
I highly recommend this place!
I'm never going anywhere else ever again.
Oh!
& I forgot to mention that they even have cute little bear chairs for kids when they get pedicures too!
So if you have kids & they want to get a pedicure, this is definitely the place to go!

Loved my $17.50 pedicure, especially because it had the hot stone.
I had never gotten a pedicure with hot stone before!
I loved it!
Gave a 3 stars because the girl I had did not talk much, she moved my feet and chair without even saying a word.
Felt very awkward.
Also when I asked for white polished she looked at me like I was crazy and asked why I wanted white then talked to her coworker in their language ....
I like white on my toes?
Is that bad?
I just felt very uncomfortable.
And that's probably my biggest bet peeve when people talk in their language because it feels like they are talking bad about me.
Another thing I noticed when I got my toes done was that the polished had already chipped off before I had even left.
I let that go and just left.
But overall it was a nice pedicure, I'm complementing if I want to go back.
The price and hot stone would probably be the only reason I would go back.

This place is wonderful.
Paid $17.50 for a great pedicure!
I walked in with rough and callused feet - they did a great job making them look good.
Ladies are polite, and are quiet - which I prefer.
Paid close attention to my nails.
Really cheap and includes hot stone massage and polish.
I came in right when they opened, and they were very busy by the time I left.
Someone came in as a walk in as I was leaving, and they were able to take her right away even though they were busy.
Highly recommended because of price, politeness and attention to detail.

I am a regular at this salon!
The prices are more than affordable, and the staff does a great job.
I always request Peter, but I know that all of the techs are top-notch.
Carve some time out of your schedule to relax.
Also, for a limited time they are (or were)offering $35 hour massages.
I took them up on the offer and found myself feeling very relaxed and pampered.

I've been here a couple of times.
They are pretty cool I really enjoy their pedicure special for $17.50 with hot rocks & all that good stuff lol.
However the only thing I won't recommend is their full set I got a full set & not even 3 days later it was time for a fill.
I feel like they try & rush when doing your full set.
The pricing is good if you like a half done job or a not well done job.
Oh & one more thing the man that works there his name is Andy was a little rude both times I went like he's upset you came or something.
( wouldn't recommend him )   If you was to get a full set let Tracy so them

They are so rude here second time in a row I have been here & the guy Andy has gave me attitude.
He rolls his eyes & when he talks it's nothing but attitude , this will be my last time coming here the prices are good & everything but I rather pay $20 something to have a good job done AND be treat nicely.
