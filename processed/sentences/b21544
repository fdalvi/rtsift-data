We started off with Mango Margaritas, the obligatory salsas and chips and a delicious (complimentary) tortilla soup.
Our entrees were Red Snapper Coscina - saut√©ed red snapper filet with a zesty tomato and cilantro sauce accompanied by rice and homemade refried beans.
A picture of our entrees may be found in Webster's Dictionary under the page heading "Mediocre".
We concluded the meal by sharing a caramel flan that was too dense, but very tasty.

I like the food here.
It is good because they have a veggie been dip, so good.
I have the tostada with the veggie beans and its good.
Margaritas are good too.

The chips were good,but is that saying much?
I will give them kudos on their service,because they were very attentive.
I ordered the carne asada burrito (and you know that's the thing I check for first usually if you are a Mexican establishment) with rice and beans.
The burrito was average but the thing that didnt set well for me was their rice.
It tasted like it was out the box.
This place has a long way to go to beat Vivo Michocan, Fausto's, Super Mex,etc...

Decent food and prices.

Service was attentive and food was decent, some say bland,as they must like a lot of salt and seasoning, which I like to add a little salt,not overdo  the seasoning, like most places I have been too.
I got the shrimp fajitas and was amazed the huge shrimps I got, yummy... Lots of onions and some bell peppers, which I know come with it , but really do not partake..
The rice was a little stiff, not soft and fluffy.. And the chips with bean dip was yummy too, and change from the salsa mix... the extra star for service....
