My son's have been seeing Dr. Weiner since the day they were born.
He came to the hospital and gave them both their check-up, ever since then, we have stuck to him.
The staff is exceptional, professional, and courteous.
Your children will be in great hands.

We take our children to see Dr. Henry Ky.
He is patient, caring and spends the time to talk with you about your children's health, makes sure that they are up to date on their vaccinations and doesn't rush you.
Would highly recommend.
The staff there when we went were helpful and friendly.

The nurse got us be4 r 4:30pm appt.
very nice.
Now waiting for the dr.  We r here for sienna's cheer physical and for her to check her hands.
The visit went great.
A good visit.

Our experience with the office staff has been unpleasant every time, both on the phone and in person for visits.
The wait is always long (atleast an hour, even first thing in the morning) and it takes forever to get your questions answered.
They are incompetent when it comes to billing/insurance issues and have completely overlooked our past records from other pediatricians (which would have given our child 4 immunizations that he'd already been given.
) In order to get an immunization record, we needed to make an appointment for an office visit.
The pediatrician was short with us, seemed annoyed with any questions, and basically told us to go to the ER if we had a concern.
We are never coming back here.
This place came recommended, but apparently it's not for informed parents who want to be involved in their child's healthcare.

Dr. Muyot is amazing my two children both see her.
It's really nice to have a doctor that really cares.
We have been patients of hers for 13 years I would highly recommend her to everyone.
We go to the teneya office it's clean and the staff is always friendly.
If you are looking for a doctor look no further she's a keeper.
