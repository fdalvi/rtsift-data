I've been to other Lo-Ann's and was quite pleased.
So when we moved here, this was the first place I tried.
Also, they didn't accept the Lo-Ann's card that I had.
You know, the one that when you visit X amount of times you get a free visit.
Was highly disappointed.
I've since found a place I like much better.

This place is no long Lo-Ann Nails and Spa.
The name of the salon is B-Happy Nails & Spa.
This place is aweful!
Been only 5 days since my mani / pedi and she didn't paint to the bottom of my nail bed so I now have a big open spot on the bottom of my nail bed and the polish has already wore off the tips.
Looks ridiculous to have nail polish only in the center of the nail bed.
The pedi was just ok, but the massage chairs were more painful than relaxing (no cushion).
She spoke VERY little english and told me I was good to go.
Walked to the car and touched a nail with a finger while opening the door and it messed up the nail went in to get it fixed and she took acetone and wiped off the part that messed up and painted one coat over it and said "there you go".
Now only 5 days and $35 later and I have to go somewhere else to have them redone.
Oh did I mention she ended up cutting the skin on my fingers and NOT the cuticles.
So now my fingers are REALLY sore and pealing.
