OK...
Lets be honest.
This is a typical Walgreen's.
they advertise them selves as a health partner and then they put the medicine in the back and the booze and cigs up front.
Does that sound like the kind of health partner you want?
But aside from that pet peeve of mine they really are good.
I always get EXCELLENT service from the pharmacy.
They check and double check everything and the wait time is better than most places.
The rest of the store is clean and well maintained and the Non-Pharma employees are also very helpful.

Clean, well lit and a good layout.
Also have helpful employees when you have difficulty finding specific items.
I am a bit bummed that my wife's insurance for RX is no longer accepted there.
Now, I will need to review CVS to see how it compares.

This is my go to pharmacy.
The service is always great and they are really friendly.
My gripe is that the sign says that it opens at 7am.
The few times I had to stop by on my way into work, they don't open exactly at 7...the workers typically arrive at 7:05 and open at 7:10.
So my rating is 5 stars for the pharmacy and 1 star for the store, averaging out to 3 stars.
