Nice sitting area!
Better humidor than most shops in the area.

Lots of Locals...Good Friendly shop....Will go there again!!

I think this place closed.
There's a notice on the door that says "Notice of Bankruptcy Chapter 7"

They have a huge selection of B list cigars mostly.
They don't have many 90+ rated smokes, including any of the Padrons, 64's or 26's.
I purchased their houseblend which I intend on smoking over the weekend.
The prices are fair, lower than most shops like this in California.
