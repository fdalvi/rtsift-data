If cheap drinks, boring decor, gloomy lighting and emaciated, alcoholic drinking buddies are up your street then Balfours Bar is worth a shot.
For the rest of us, this place sucks.
I stumbled in here with my mates by chance on a night out and, even in the state we were in, we were bored and depressed by the place.
The staff are nice and it has a pool table and a dartsboard for entertainment, but it's just not good enough and doesn't do anything for the overall mood of the place.
I walked past here the other day at about 11:30 in the morning and there were two men and a woman shouting and swearing about how someone's dog needed to be taken to the vet.
I think that pretty much sums it up.

This place is as rough as a badgers arse.
Inside, Balfours Bar is deffinatly a place where you come to drink away your sorrows through the day so that you can pass out at night.
You dont talk to anybody and you dont make eye contact with anybody.
When you do have to make your intentions clear you do so in a muttered grumble where the only distinguishable words are rude or about urinating.
When you need to smoke go outside and blinkingly step into the early morning sunlight, stare menicingly at passers by and shout at each other.
You then return inside and be mean to the barstaff who are trying thier hardest not to cry and quit.
Go home instead of drink here.
