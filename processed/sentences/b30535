Trailer trash Phoenix now have a home!
This place smells of urine but of which the aroma candles that are burning cannot cover.
The locals with no taste in music, the songlist is all over the place with no sense of direction.
Bare and lacking, the decor is in major need of the Fab 5 from NYC.
I'm sorta afraid of even trying the food.
Beach theme in the middle of the desert?
Get the picture.
Someone mentioned an Open Mike Night, but not gonna stick around here, I'm too afraid of what I'll see.
Too many people wearing sweat pants for my like, and the woman next to me at the bar is using a hand stapler that the barkeep loaned out so she could 'fix' her shoe!?!?
Did I mention the drinks are dirt cheap?

I don't know what Dave S.'s problem is, but The Playa II is a very homey, comfortable neighborhood bar.
I am not trailer trash - major eastern city symphony orchestra musician with degrees who stumbled upon Phoenix when retiring - but I enjoy hanging out here in a friendly environment with Mama Sharen running the show.
The kitchen is VERY good and very reasonable.
Italian night on Wednesday is one of our favorites.
Hamburgers are very good.
Great drink specials.
This is not a Scottsdale phony place - give it a try.

Smells nasty.
Free breakfast on Sunday.
Not worth the trip

Love this place!
Momma (The Owner) is the most amazing woman you could ever meet.
She always has the best interest for all of we customers.
They have poker some nights and breakfast for free at 9am on Sundays.
Great place to watch football, play pool or hang out with you friends from the neighborhood.
