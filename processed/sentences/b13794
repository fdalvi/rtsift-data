VERY knowledgeable and helpful staff.
They even give you a water bottle to use to bring in samples of your water that they will test for free as often as you want!
Price is fair, and they stock pretty much everything you could ever possibly need for your pool.

Went there today to pick up a couple of items.
Waited to check out and both sales people were busy with other customers which took quite a while.
That was no problem waited till they were done.
Finally one of the clerks was free and instead of ringing up our two items told us someone had come in before us and he needed to check on him first.
Seriously, we had waited in line more than 10 minutes and he couldn't take 30 seconds to ring us up!!!!!!
The other customer was just browsing the store and hadn't even come up to the counter!!!!!
We just put the items on the counter and left.
Normally we buy our pool supplies from Leslie's but there are many pool supply stores in the valley and its time to take my money elsewhere.
Won't be hard to find better customer service than this!!!!!

My bad - this place is not closed just moved down closer to Teakwoods.
