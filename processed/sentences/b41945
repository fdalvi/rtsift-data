A coworker brought in the tres leches cupcakes--- to die for!!
Love LOVE.
Definitely ordering from them soon.

Mmmmmmm!!!!!
These cupcakes are SO GOOD!
Definitely coming back for more.

Bought a dozen of the Americana Apple Pie cupcakes for an office party recently.
They were easily the most amazing cupcakes I've ever had.
I've since placed another order for double that amount for the 4th of July party I'm going to.

Had a dozen of these delivered to my fianc√© for his birthday and he just loved them -- even better -- his mother COULD NOT STOP RAVING ABOUT THEM!!
(major daughter in law points!
) She doesn't normally eat dessert and just could not stop talking about the tres leches and how moist and incredible they were!
I know what we will be bringing next time we visit her!
Can't wait for their Gluten Free items too!
Good Gluten Free desserts can be hard to come by, but this place just nails it.
