My boyfriend's grandmother celebrated her 90th birthday here.
It was a lovely location, at the foot of Cammelback Mountain.
She was the happiest that I've ever seen her.
Being that she is a lifelong Catholic, it was a really special location for her.

I've been here a few times for weekend retreats and to visit friends who were on retreats.
The place is great - secluded amongst Camelback Mountain.
The only downer for me is that I'm a local, so when I go on retreats, I like to travel far so I truly feel away from it all.
It also is no fun when it's so hot so you don't want to go outside.
But for people who are coming from out of town, this is definitely a great retreat site.

I've been here twice so far and highly recommend it!
Great place for a retreat, meditation and Spiritual cleansing.
Terrific grounds and facilities!
Solid!
