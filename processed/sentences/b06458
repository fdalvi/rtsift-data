This place is a total dive...it was messy and disorganized.
Most of the party items were cheap and poor quality and the staff when we visited, were hardly helpful and didn't seem to want to be bothered.
Spend your money elsewhere.

HI I'm Amy the owner of the Party Supply House.
In the summer of 2012 I remodeled my whole store.
You will find that my store is new and improved!
Not only do I have all your party and cake decorating needs, I also keep my costumes and accessories out all year.
If anyone came into the store during the remodel, I am truly sorry for the inconvenience.
I agree it was messy but with a lot of hard work  I am very proud of the outcome!

I came looking for a specific thing that I was not finding at the other party stores and this was my last hope as it was too late to order online.
I needed little tiny sombrero hats.
I asked for the fiesta section and they had a great selection.
It wasn't a big fiesta section but they had a lot in that little section to make room for allll the other themed items they had.
I found closely enough of what I was looking for at a reasonable price.
Their prices overall were better then Party City and Party USA but some items were pretty closely priced and they had different items.
It seemed Party City and Party USA order from the same category.
I did not browse because I didn't want to be late to see my pretend boyfriend Phillip Phillips perform.
But at my glance around there would have been a lot to browse!
Big store!
