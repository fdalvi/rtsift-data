Stopped in for a LARGE iced coffee and a breakfast biscut sandwich.
The iced coffee was much larger than most coffee shops and hit the spot.
The drive thru was busy but the restaurant inside had a small family enjoying breakfast and me.
I found the location to be clean and the service friendly.
Oh yeah and the bacon for my breakfast, real bacon, I'm impressed.

Don't like fast food, but sometimes you just have to settle.
They added lettuce when I said not too....  spicy chicken wrap tastes ok for fast food

For a Wendy's, I really like this one.
Everyone is always really nice to me, and the store is super clean.
No complaints.
Also, these chains need to start posting their hours!

Positive: fast and accurate service.
Close to my office.
Negative: Nothing ever tastes right.
The fries are limp and the frosties have an odd taste and texture.
The chili is served the wrong side of warm.

Wendy's is no luxury dining experience in any case, but this one is exceptionally bad.
The ketchup dispensers are broken, but the staff doesn't care.
The cashier used more obscenities than I would like my six year old to hear.
The dining area was dirty.
Worn paint and damaged seating everywhere.
The bathrooms have a gas station feel to them.
The food is low quality, even by Wendy's low standards.
If you must eat here, get it drive through and keep your expectations low.

Wendy's.
It was raining today in Phoenix!
Flatbread sandwich.
With medium fries and dp.
Medium is like 20 oz of soda.
I ate the food - it was fast food quality.

Thus Wendy's is usually pretty good.
Busy location.
The food is always hot and fresh.

Always had good food here, just went in for a frosty float and the lady at the window barely spoke to me.
I got my order pretty quickly considering the long line ahead of me, but no line is long enough that you can't say thank you or "have a good evening" to a customer.
