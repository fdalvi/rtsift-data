Beer World sounds alot more fun than it really is.
It's really just a store with many beers,  but not as good a selection as you would find at your local Bev Mo.
It's been a while since I went there, so maybe they have more beers on hand now.
Anyway, a decent memory of one of the most alcohol -soaked trips I've ever been on.

We support and shop locally owned and operated businesses.
Locally owned and operated beer stores just happen to be a favorite!
Dave knows his beer and has some nice high % beers to choose from!

This place is awesome!
These guys are friendly and know their stuff.
They have a lot of great beers on hand and make great recommendations.
Plus, they have a drive-thru and a cat for a mascot!
How cool is that?

This place is great-better prices than large boxstores.
Sure, the selection is not as extensive but more than enough to choose from.
Dave is entertaining and knowledgable.
And the diverse clientele-could be a reality show!
My favorite stop on way home from work.
