This gym studio deserves more than 5 stars for sure!
This place is equipped with hard core trainers some of which hold the highest record of pro hits in one show in one year.
It's owned by big names like, Whitney Jones and Felicia Romero just to name a couple.
They know who has talent and they know who can train hard.
Great job guys, I'm so happy to be a part of this team!
For a great trainer recommendation, Crystal is where its at.
No effin around with this tiger, she knows what you need and she's not very easy on you which is much appreciated if you want results.
She is a fitness competitor and is on her way to getting her pro card.
She's a hard worker, determined and has an endless passion for fitness.

Honestly the best personal training gym!
Everyone there is so nice!
They care about your wants and needs!
And when they give you a meal plan they make it with the foods you like!!
I train with Erik Young there and he is fantastic!
Definitely knows how to kick some butt!

Very happy with the results I've achieved from training here!
A little pricey but expected and worth it!
