I just came back from the candle lighting ceremony at my church for my Greek Orthodox Easter.
So Xristos Anesti to all the Orthodox Christians out there.
Right before midnight, the church goes black and we all have our candles ready.
Then each of our candles gets lit from the person next to us until everyone has a lit candle.
The ceremony is so beautiful that I started crying.
At that moment when we celebrate Christ rising, I feel so spiritual and close to him.
I felt something pass through my body.
Another year, another Easter, another beautiful ceremony.
Xristos Anesti kai Xronia Polla.

Perhaps the most beautiful church in Phoenix.
The Greeks have a reputation of being a loud, friendly bunch, and this church prooved the point.
The greeter at the door asked if we were familair with the Orthodox, and offered a prayer book tohelpus follow the service.
Being raised in the Eastern Catholic Church, and Baptised Russian Orthodox, I know a little about the church, so his help was unneeded, but greatly appreciated.
The Choir is magnificent, the Priest LOUD AND CLEAR in his chanting, and the whole atmoshpere is great.
Go some Sunday, and see what worship should be!

I run past my Church when I run along the Canal so I thought I should review this beautiful place of worship.
As a member of the Catholic and Greek Orthodox Faith, I'm very proud to attend Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Cathedral.
I always feel such a spiritual connection as soon I walk in.
The greeters always make me feel at home with their welcome smiles.
This Church by far has the best Members/Congregation.
Xristos Anesti celebrations always bring me to the verge of joyous tears so if you're a person of Faith and want to try something different, I highly recommend their Easter Celebration services.
