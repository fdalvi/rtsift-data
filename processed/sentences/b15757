Well, if you're in Vegas and you're staying at the Wynn, it's hard not to see Cartier.
Resplendent in its bejeweled glory, Cartier beckons.
If you have to ask the price, you simply can't afford it - but you're in Vegas and you already knew that, right?
So complaining about the stratospheric prices here is a bit like going into a Ferrari dealership and asking about a cheap commute car.
And wait ... there *is* a Ferrari dealership at the Wynn, which happens to charge admission for gawkers and tire-kickers.
And I don't recommend actually asking them about the cheap commute car ...  ... but back to Cartier.
I've been to the boutiques in New York and Paris, and this one is definitely smaller but no less willing to snuggle up to you (and your platinum card).And the trinkets do tempt; I found myself orbiting around a display case with cuff links, pens and such like.
Alas, most trips to boutiques like this end up being a feast for the eyes only.
And the staff there were happy to oblige.
Professional and unassuming, the folks there seem to treat everyone walking in as a prospective client, which is good ... because this is Vegas, and you never know who might be walking around with a mitt full of Benjamins looking for the right piece of bling.
