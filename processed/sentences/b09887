I love going to their Thrift Store.
I can always find something there that I like.
But, more importantly, I'm very happy to know that the monies received goes to help our little homeless kitties.
Sometimes I shop there just so I can visit the kitties next door.
Thank you 4 Paws for your wonderful service to our little furry friends.

This place is under investigation for euthanizing cats and kittens with faulty testing results.
This is far from a no kill shelter - their vet, Dr. France, should not even have a license.
DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAT OR KITTEN HERE!
