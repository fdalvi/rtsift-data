I love this place!
Always a friendly staff and they are very involved in facilitating pet adoptions.
They have great food and treat options for your pets.
I buy Earthborn for my two dogs and cats.
They have a buy 10 bags, get 1 free at this location.
I was also impressed with the prices.
In most cases, they are less expensive than Petsmart when comparing the same or similiar products.
I am loyal.

If you are looking for a place to buy high quality pet food at very good prices then look no further, friendly staff, clean store.

My husband and I shop here quite frequently for pet food, toys, beds, etc.
We purchase Blue Buffalo dry dog and cat food and every tenth bag of each kind is free at Pet Club!
The staff is always friendly and helpful.
I have a small dog that is prone to seizures that I must feed medicine twice a day to.
We used to use Blue Buffalo canned food to put his pills in but we noticed it was decaying his teeth quite a bit.
My husband explained this to an employee at this Pet Club and he suggested we try an oatmeal type brand called Embark.
My dog tried it once and was hooked.
He seems to enjoy it more than what we were previously providing him.
The employees here are always willing to answer questions and provide useful information.
They all seem to have excellent customer service skills at this location.
