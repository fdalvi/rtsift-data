I love this place!
There Topperstix are amazing and you have to try there Buffalo Chicken Topper pizza, it's out of this world!
They are also open till 3:30am so when hunger hits, this is the place to call!

First time trying toppers pizza, will never try again.
Extremely greasy, the pizza smelled like burning plastic and tasted like chemicals.
Not good at all.

Closes early repeatedly.
If its an evening with nothing else open, not cool.
Guy inside listening to loud bg music.
All lights on, before closing time, open neon glowing.
Me at door: starving, cold, and now no hope for food in madison; unless someone opens a steak 'n shake, waffle house, etc.
Seriously, why is it near impossible to get food here?
The gyro sandwich I previously had sucked.
Bread wad hard and stale.
Phone# is longwinded & unhelpful, no option to leave message for main office.
Not going to this slice o' somethin again.

Note: I am only giving this franchise establishment three stars as a rule I have for chains.
I'm from the Dallas area and had never heard of Topper's until a trip to Madison.
After spending the night getting hammered downtown until 2:00 a.m., I was in need of sustenance.
I was staying at a hotel in Sun Prairie and everything there shuts down at 10.
IHOP(E. Washington location) was packed and McDonald's didn't really sound appealing.
Saw that Topper's is open until 3 and I figured "what the hell".
I ordered a large 3 topping pizza special that included an order of Topperstix.
The fella taking my order was friendly and patient, considering I had about 3 gallons of Long Island ice tea in me, and he suggested the taco Topperstix.
Total was just shy of $20.
I get back to my hotel room and dive into a damn good pie.
The crust had good chew, the toppings tasted fresh and were plentiful and there was plenty of cheese and sauce.
What I really enjoyed was the taco Toppersitx.
They were way better than I thought they would be and complimented the pizza nicely.
If you're in the need for a quick meal, Topper's is a good bet in my opinion.
