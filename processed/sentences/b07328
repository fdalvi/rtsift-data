Wow!
I just had a great tv repair experience at Melrose Electronics.
The owner, Richard, is knowledgeable and friendly.
We took our tv in because it was not turning on.
He gave us a quote (and by quote I mean an amount far under what 3 other establishments had offered) and then fixed the tv within 2 days!
Wow!
Great, old fashioned repair shop that doesn't haggle or hassle customers.
I will return here 100%!

I would not even put one star but you at least have to pick one.
My gosh, bad, bad mistake taking my unit there.
Stay on top of your repair for he'll own it after 30 days.
Its the first thing he makes you sign!
I think that is the mission after all.
I haven't been so upset with an outcome in a long time.
Strange free estimate, all over the place repair plan and failure to keep in touch gives this shop ZERO stars.
Thanks for ruining the karaoke party sir.
Arrrghh!

This guy knows his stuff.
Helped me to determine whether or not to actually fix the tv or just buy a new one.
A real straight shooter
