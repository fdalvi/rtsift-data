Great customer service!
Nicole and Jim went above and beyond to make our rental enjoyable.
Thanks Jucy we had a great trip to the Grand Canyon!

Great setup for 2 people for a weeklong trip.
Anymore than 2 would be way too crammed to fit gear and bodies and food.
Couldn't get the fridge to work properly so used ice- so not much room.
Linens very nice and fresh- the blanket left fuzzies all over so it was very obviously new.
Had to fix our own flat tire but 24-hr call center was helpful.
Pickup and drop off was very easy and friendly staff but place seemed a bit sketchy likely due to new location under construction.
Would rent again but would be nice if van was available without the penthouse since we didn't use it.
Definitely do unlimited mileage; look for a groupon deal.
Oh, and the van is very photogenic...
