Went on a drive last fall with the parents and stopped in here.
Cute little diner with a very friendly staff.
The food was good and we all enjoyed our meals.
One of the waitresses noticed our dog in the car and offered us some water to give her, nice touch.

Home Cooking!
Friendly service makes you feel welcomed.
Breakfast is served all day.
Only open for breakfast and lunch so don't wait too late to sit down for lunch.
Love the Chicken theme, I am a chicken collector!
UPDATE : went back again in July 2013 and everything changed.
Apparently the new owner has trouble keeping employees.
The cook had not shown up in two days so the owner (who is not a cook) was cooking.
The server made it obvious to us that she did not like the owner or her ability to cook.
Service was not good, food was ...ok. Was charged extra for fries with sandwich instead of potato salad, but server never mentioned it was a dollar more.
That info was hidden in the tiny fine print on a different page of the menu from the sandwiches.
The bathroom was even dirty so I guess the dishwasher quit too.
Disappointed in the total down grade of the place.

I've eaten a few times here.
The service is always good and the food has always been excellent.
I especially like the deserts always fresh and unique.
Thanks for the great food.
