Grand China's lunch specials are my BFF.
They make kung pao veggies for me, and it's like a taste of comfort not known since I was in the womb (or so I imagine.
) it's always perfect, always quick, always hot and delicious.
Oh...
I love it so.
The service is great, my water is never empty and the servers don't bug you but they're always around if you need anything.

Ive been going to Grand China for about 4 or 5 years now.
Not once have I had a bad experience.
When I do eat inside the restaurant, Ive always had quick friendly service.
Their lunch specials are anywhere from $5-$7.
They include soup, egg roll, wonton and whichever entree you pick with fried rice.
Definitely worth it.
The dinner specials are about $2-$3 more than the lunch specials but they also come with some extras.
No matter what you get, you will usually get more than what you pay for, especially if you stick with the lunch and dinner specials.
The service is very consistent between the 3 restaurants I visit.

Discovered this restaurant about 5 yrs ago, It's close by.
Have dined there probably 30 times.
Have had only 1 negative experience.
Lunch or dinner food is always consistent and good.
Service is great, friendly and competent.
Very quick on the beverage refills!!
They have recently added Teriyaki bowls, chicken and beef.
Very reasonable and filling.
If you want some good chinese food and in the NW area give this a try.

Why have this restaurant listed?
IT HAS CLOSED DOWN!!
