Long story short.
This restaurant is hopeless.
My girlfriend and I checked this place out after buying an itison voucher.
Unlimited tapas sounded fun and I was hopeful we'd be treated tasty food.
There's no menu because the restaurant claims that they change the menu based on local and season produce.
My palette says frozen food defrosted in a microwave.
The no menu thing is to hide the fact they're not serving anything fresh and saves them making a decent menu.
Instead of tasty tapas we were served lukewarm (at best!!!
) food that'd been microwaved or just taken out of a packet from morrisons.
The wine selection was limited, craftily missing out the cheaper wines leaving you with a choice of Â£19 a bottle or more.
Service was average, one of the waiters didn't explain what any of the dishes were when he brought them to the table  Do not go here, even if someone else foots the bill.

The restaurant is fairly new and located in the ground floor of a old Bond Warehouse just off Constitution Street.
They have made use of the double height ceilings and put in a mezzanine level, creating a small area ideal for large groups of people and providing more table space.
We received a warm welcome and were seated at our table near the large arched windows.
The interior is clean, simple and especially liked the candles in red coloured glasses dotted up the stairs.
Giving to space an almost zen-like feeling.
All the staff were authentic Spaniards which felt reassuring.
I love tapas and so this restaurant did not let me down.
The menu is broken down into 3 sections, 'From the orchard', 'from the sea' and 'from the farm'.
We ordered 6 tapas between the two of us, wondering if it would be enough?
Thankfully it was plenty, the dishes were small but tasty.
Do try the pork and mushroom cream sauce and Monkfish, prawn and squid in tomato sauce.
First time I've eaten squid that isn't rubbery, it just dissolved in the mouth, lovely!
