This is THE only place in the valley to come if you own a Mustang or other classic car and need it worked on.
The mechanics are great and they sell a ton of different parts for your restore job.
Great shop.

John sold me a transmission with a year warranty and it broke and he told me I broke it so it wasn't under warranty..... What the hell is a warranty for exactly??
If it breaks it's fixed by the shop..
I had to haggle for a day just to get him to cover half the cost.. Beware a warranty at the mustang shop is not a warranty.
Oh yea and he sold me a 5.0 engine that had the lowest compression that I've ever seen and almost didn't take it back.
40psi was the highest measurement I got on cylinder 2.if you want good mustang parts go else ware!

Not recommended.
I had work done on my 69 fastback several times by The Mustang Shop.
First of all, each time, the repairs took weeks longer than I was told they would take.
I was talked into replacing the air conditioning with a modern system.
John told me it would blow "ice cold".
It did not blow ice cold and was ineffective on hot days.
I asked if they had a bezel to accommodate a CD player.
I let myself get talked into having them install my new stereo.
Bad move.
Poor, ugly work.
Several other instances - work always took longer than promised.
