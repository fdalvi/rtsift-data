I went here with a Groupon and have been seeing Patricia for six months now.
She is a great lady and is as nice as they get.
I have had  several  microdermabrasion  and a peel.

I'm so glad that my first facial was from Patricia.
She is professional, kind, and very accommodating to her clients.
I left my first appointment feeling (and I personally feel looking) five years younger.
I am officially hooked.

Saw Patricia for first time this week.
So impressed.
Just the best combo of skill and personality.
Beautiful, classy and well appointed suite.
I had a microderm and enzyme mask.
Skin still feels great.
I've been looking for a new aesthetician since the woman i had been seeing up and moved out of state.
Patricia was the third person I've seen and as they say, third time is the charm.
