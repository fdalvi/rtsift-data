A little bit more expensive then other Chevron.
but it a gas station.
Friendly workers inside.

This was my normal gas station that I used to go because 1.
Lived in seven hills & 2. my mom works at M resort.
It was down the street from where I lived and I would stop by and get some Roy's Deli subs.
The gas is usually more expensive than other Chevron gas stations but it was convenient since it is right there.
In addition, Roy's Deli makes some awesome subs.
It was like where were you all my life, roy's deli?
From what I remember, the sub that I had was about $5-6.
Very good and recommend trying it if you ever have to stop by this gas station and need a to-go lunch or something.
Overall, the cashiers there are sweet and friendly.

They have a 24 hour gaming center with free drinks to players.
This is my go to gas station when we are visiting this part of Henderson.
Just wish that their gas prices were more in line with the competition.
At least the prices are lower than California!

They just updated the gas station and added a newer car wash system.
No more $7 car wash.
They still have the $7 car wash but it doesn't have alot of wash cyles in it and so they have the $9 and its the top wash.
They added a new Water Wizard machine.
They had a older water wizard 1.0 but now they have a water wizard 3.0

The burgers here are amazing !
Just like they should be very amazed at the staffs quick and very professional pace
