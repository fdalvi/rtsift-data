Backyard Dream Builders and Stewart are a dream come true for people that are looking to do heavy or light construction on their home.
I am positive that everyone has worked with a contractor that you were less than happy with, but that could not be further from the truth when working with Stewart!
We have had out fair share of people that were not on time, didn't show up, or took total advantage of us, and I will NEVER use anyone else again besides Steward and his crew.
The work that we had done on our backyard was FANTASTIC and everyone else that sees it agrees!
Stewart is not only at the site everyday, and works to get the job done to perfection, but he is always early and ALWAYS keeps everyone in the loop.
We are using him for a couple other projects and can't wait to see how those turn out!

Here it is: I called Stewart at Backyard and CLEARLY explained my project.
It's a smaller one and was he interested?
He wanted to see it and  bid it and we set up a time when it was convenient for him to come to see and quote it.
He did not quote on-site and wanted to send via email.
I'm totally fine with that.
However, he NEVER followed up with me with a quote.
From my view:  I think this is a waste of a (potential) clients  time.
Thus, the 1 star.
If he reads this and follows up or can prove he sent an email that bounced back  (It's been three weeks now since his visit)  I will update this review.
Until then...message to all contractors: don't waste my time, it's not fair.
