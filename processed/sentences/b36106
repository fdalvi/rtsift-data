I've always been very picky when it comes to finding the right personal trainer for myself, because of my specific goals.
I have no interest in paying someone to watch me run on a treadmill or jump rope, I can do this myself and don't need to pay someone to stand next to me as I am doing it.
As a chiropractor, I want to make sure that I am able deliver great adjustments without having to feel exhausted at the end of the day.
I am also looking to refine and develop specific movement patterns that will allow me to give the best adjustments to my patients, so the exercises and drills that I practice are very specific to me and my body.
When I was introduced to Peter Pinto by James, I knew that he was exactly what I have been looking for.
Peter understands that the nervous system governs our body and therefore is able to integrate neurology with his training.
He took the time to listen and evaluate exactly what I was looking for and needed, instead of making assumptions as to what he thinks I needed.
I've referred many others to Peter, and have heard nothing but great things about him.
They absolutely appreciate him and the detailed analysis that he gives them.
Peter caters to your needs specifically, which I find is one of the most important qualities that make a great physical trainer.

The most unique and intense training i have ever done!
Routines change constantly and is challenging.
I have been training with them since march and have lost about 26 lbs.
The trainers are good and the class is fun!
I highly recommend this class.

I love the way they train here.
Their knowledge of nutrition and movement is better than any other studio that I've been to.
They have a certain way about motivating you, while building a supportive training community and having fun at the same time.
They really understand all of the elements of a holistic fitness program.
Hurts so good!
I love it!
