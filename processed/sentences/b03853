I have been using Sam the Bug Man since 2003.
I cannot recommend them highly enough -they provide quick and reasonably priced services for almost all pests and, they are extremely knowledgeable about pests here in the hills..
I know that my yard, house, pets and family are in the very best hands!
You will NOT be disappointed.

This company is GREAT!
I would give then 10 stars if I could.
We moved into a new house Easter weekend and discovered it was infested with ticks.
I called Sam the Bug Man and they not only knew what to do right off the bat, they came out and did it the same day (Sat before Easter).
They were really nice and went out of their way to come out on short notice on a holiday weekend.
I will be using them regularly.
Don't hesitate to call them!

Tony came to our home to take care of a large Africanized bee colony.
He arrived when he said he would, he was thorough, knowledgeable and conscientious.
He patiently answered all of my questions about bees and just about every other insect new to me since I'm new to the Sonoran Desert.
He even returned the following day to ensure that everything was fine.
