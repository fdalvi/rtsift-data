Best place for eyebrows!
I go there regularly and I am yet to be disappointed.
The lady that does my eybrows is so friendly.
I totally recommend her.

Here is an Awesome story.
My boyfriend and I went to get pedicures together and this was the chosen place.!
We LOVED them.
They were attentive, friendly, and most importantly CHEAP.!
Super close to home and did such a great job.
I was very impressed, being it was the first place we checked out randomly.
Would definitely recommend .
