My daughter and I went this Monday on Martin Luther King day.
We had an appointment set for 1:30.
The wait was long.
We sat there for a good hour.
We watched as the doctors did all the contact lense fittings before they took the eye exams.
This wait aside, I really did like Dr. Patel.
He was very friendly and explained everything to us in detail.
We will definitley go back to see him in the future.
We went to get glasses next and this wasn't too bad either.
We where waited on right away.
We had a newer associate help us and she asked for help from her coworkers as needed.
She was very friendly and the overall experience was good.

Horribe guest services.
There is no such thing as glasses in one hour at this store

From scheduling an appointment here to getting assistance with picking the perfect frame, I had an exemplary experience.
I was fortunate to have Joyce as my point of contact as she went above and beyond to meet my selective expectations.
After getting to know me a bit, she helped navigate towards exactly what I was looking for.
She gave great, honest feedback.
She also ran the numbers at the end to make sure that I was getting the most for my money.
She valued my time and made me feel like an authentic person rather than just another customer.
The selection is pretty good overall.
They have generic and designer frames with the option of getting "high definition" lenses.
My lenses turned out great as the clarity is awesome and glare and reflection are minimized (which is important for my job as I have to give occasional presentations for large groups).
I wasn't too fond of the wait when picking up the new glasses the next day (hence the 1-star deduction), but am completely satisfied with how well they fit and look.
I will probably be a repeat customer and I recommend giving them a try!
