I was excited to find this in my neighborhood, and I will go back--HOWEVER--It smelled like BO, and I'm not sure if that's better or worse than a resale shop that is full of overpowering air fresheners.
The man behind the counter was a bit of an oversharer (he hates when people bring in a big pile of clothes and use their store credit for a small number of nice things) but I was pleased with the 2 nice toys I walked out with for about $8.
They have a lot of stuff in a very small space, but inspect it carefully before you buy it!

I love this store.
They are a locally owned and operated resale store.
They accept toys, clothes, and certain baby furniture.
Bring in your stuff for store credit to buy new stuff.
There are very few shops of this type in madison.
None other that I am aware of on the east side for sure that specializes in kids resale and gives you store credit.
The owners are extremely friendly and receptive.
I wish there were more stores like this.
I only wish it were bigger!
They are an an asset to the community!
Also they are near Ellas Deli so you can make it an afternoon if you like!

This place is great!
Today I picked up a very nice wool sweater for my daughter, Spider-Man laptop for my son, a Kenneth Cole shirt for him, a Sit n Spin, a xylophone, dolls and ponies and books and tons of other clothes and boots--- all for less than $60!
We're thrilled.
Very well priced and nice condition.
Get there now!

I've been to this store a total of 3 times and 2 of the times it wasn't open like it said it would be..
I don't know if the owner was running late or sick but it just seems really unprofessional to run a store on whatever hours are convenient for him.
As far as the store I love it, Nice selection of things.. Now only if I can get there when he's there I would love it even more.
