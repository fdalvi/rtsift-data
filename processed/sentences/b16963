Great prices and friendly staff!

Wonderful staff!!
So helpful & the prices we're very reasonable.

Holy after-Christmas madness.
Kohl's puts this low end department store to shame.
I found nothing I liked.
Don't go here unless you're paid in cash every other Friday and have a family of 7.

They do have some really cute stuff, but this whole new pricing thing...it blows.
Things were so much more less expensive before...
However, if they'd follow suit with other JCP's and add a Sephora...I'd be there weekly!

Under new ownership.
They have really done a great overhaul on the store it has a sleek new look and they have a Sephora in there now.
It used to look geared towards an older crowd but has a new hip look.

Yay!
Sephora is finally here!!
This is the only reason I decided to return to JcPenney.
I was pleasantly surprised that things have once again been changed to include sales.
In fact it seems that the whole store seemed back to normal with sales and clearance.
I may actually start shopping here again.
