The best dentist EVER!
From the time you walk in, Maria is warm and friendly.
To seeing Dr. Hsu she's informative as to procedures, and an infectious laugh.
I'm sending my wife and kids, ASAP.

Finally a dentist that cares.
Pecos dental goes above and beyond to make sure that I'm taking care of.
I always enjoy my interaction with my the entire staff.
I highly recommend them to anybody looking for a dentist.

Dr. Hsu is the consummate professional and she provides the ultimate in dental care.
Until I met Dr. Hsu, I had never come in contact with a dentist who did not think that all wisdom teeth are bad, that they must be immediately removed and whom even inferred that to not have done so already, put the patient's intelligence in question.
I had a wisdom tooth that was going bad and she suggested several alternatives for its remedy.
There was no pressure to have it removed.
We eventually decided on a crown, which was no easy task for any dentist.
But, she got it done.
That was 10 years ago and I still have my tooth.
Pecos Dental is highly recommended and as long as Dr. Hsu is practicing, I will go nowhere else.
