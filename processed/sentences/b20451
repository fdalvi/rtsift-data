I stumbled across Affordable Antiques the other day and I really enjoyed having a browse around.
Selling mainly antique furniture there is a great selection on offer and the friendly shop owner advised me that they get knew stock in every week so it's always worth popping back if you're looking for a new wardrobe or dinner table.
There were lots of wardrobes and I imagined stepping inside the intricate designs to find myself in Narnia or buying an old writing desk to find a 100 year old love letter hidden in a secret drawer.
The prices are very reasonable for the quality of the products on offer and if you're looking to furnish your home then this place is a good shout.

It can be very easy to doubt a shop when it gives itself a name that appears to be on first impressions a bit of a juxtaposition, but if you come here, as advertised on the shop front, you will genuinely find affordable antiques in the sense that they are good value for money and not excessively priced.
The stock held here is almost exclusively furniture, so don't come here expecting to find any trinkets or general items of interest smaller than a chair.
However, for the items it does stock, it does do rather well.
Take one of the sideboards on offer for example.
This was a piece that really caught my eye, simply because it's a fabulous piece of craftsmanship and quite obviously a cut above what you would normally find.
Although the side holds a slight defect in the form of a cosmetic crack it's still great value at just under £400.
Now I know you're thinking that it's a lot of money, because you can pick up a flat pack sideboard for £250, but consider not only the difference in quality and atmosphere generated by these items, but also the fact that in ten years your flat pack sideboard will be falling apart and worth very little whereas your antique will be a slightly older antique.
