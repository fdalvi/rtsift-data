Went here to have my engagement ring cleaned - I am terrible about taking it off when working in the kitchen, etc!
This jeweler's website claims they do jewelry cleaning, however, when I walked in and asked, the man working was very rude and dismissive.
He asked "is it our merchandise?
"  When I told him no, I just need my ring cleaned - he stared at me a half beat, then said the jeweler was not in until next week.
Basically turned his back and continued playing with the rings in the display case.
Needless to say, I will not be returning next week when this mysterious jeweler is due to return.
I will take my business elsewhere!

The guy is always friendly and willing to help out did a good job at sizing a ring.

Came in to get my watch battery changed.
It was 15 min before closing but Mike (owner) didn't hesitate to help me out.
He got my watch battery replaced and all the while, I had a great conversation with him.
Really nice.
Funny how he pegged me as an LA girl from the start so give him props for paying attn.
to his customers.
Have to say, just from that interaction, he's got a customer who will definitely be back.
There was no pressure which I find sometimes at jewelry places.
