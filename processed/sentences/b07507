We are renting a storage unit for a second time from this location.
Doug is very nice and because I'd spoken with him ahead of time, our paperwork was already waiting for us when we arrived to rent the unit.
That made the process so much faster.
I especially like that you get to use a moving truck for free with your unit rental (even though it is at a different location).
We needed it some extra time and that was only $15 - a bargain.
Thanks, Doug!

I worked with this location to rent a unit for a customer and the service was always outstanding.
I look forward to working with them again!
