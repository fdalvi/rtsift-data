Been using this company for years for all of our custom uniform needs.
We run a commercial service company providing janitorial and maintenance services to buildings all over the US and all of our uniform orders come out of this location.
They are always on time and have very competitive rates.
I would recommend this company to anyone.
Blue collar also has provided me with all of my own non-uniform industrial clothing.
They always have a very good selection in their store and have the ability to order anything I desire.

Great pricing and durable clothes.
I have shirts that I've been wearing for 10 years.

I can't praise them enough!
I've been buying from them for years, and hopefully will for many years to come.
The quality of the products they sell is the best and the prices are amazing.
So nice to find this in a small local shop that provides THE BEST customer service!
Even though I moved to Tucson a few years ago, I still make sure to stop in whenever I need anything they might carry.

Best little shop for uniforms.great to deal with and quality work  Jerry
