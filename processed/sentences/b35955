Love the carts.
Pretty much love all the carts.
But whenever I eat from any of the carts this must accompany my meal.
She has a really large variety of fruits to make smoothies and you can mix and match.
There are also non-fruit things that you can add like chocolate but I always stick to the fruit.
MmmmmmmMMm.

Nice smoothies but this review is more a plug for their spring rolls-- not sure if these are a regular item (there was a sign taped to the straw dispenser advertising them), but a single spring roll here was nearly as big as a burrito-- so a spring roll and a smoothie will pretty much set you up for lunch!

We generally head to Madison a few times per year to hit up the Dane Co Farmers Market (because it's amazing!).
The Natural Juice cart is almost always on the agenda because, let's face it - the market is CROWDED.
The sea of humanity can get overwhelming, especially on a hot day.
Enter "break time" at the Natural Juice cart - the ladies that work here are fast and pleasant.
Their juice is fresh and delicious and reasonably priced.
The Mister generally gets a smoothie but I stick with refreshing, tart limeade.
One other plus - you can get creative and design your own smoothie flavor.
Want a soursop and blackberry?
Chocolate and avocado?
Blackberry and jackfruit?
No problem - they'll make it for you.
