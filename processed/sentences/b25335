Helpful customer service folks and even extra people on duty when the ATM was down.
If only the real estate aspect of Chase was as good as the banking side.

I have honestly had nothing but exceptional service each time I've visited this branch.
Not one person has ever come across as too busy or put out by me, even when I came in with a deposit AT 6:00pm.
I know it is extremely rude to do this and I apologized up and down and if they were bothered, they never once let it be known.
I visit this branch on a pretty regular basis due to the location of my office and the necessity for making almost daily deposits and can say they are THE best.
I have used several locations and have been very happy with each one but this one takes the cake.

This is the best bank ever.
I like Chase as a bank in general, but the people at this branch are absolutely stellar.
They have helped me with everything from normal banking transactions to handling my mother's estate.
I opened my account at a different branch, but went to this one when neither the staff at my branch nor customer service at the 800 number could help.
They solved that problem with such a great attitude; for the first time in it seems like forever I felt like someone actually wanted to help me.
I've been going there ever since, and they continue to go above and beyond for me.

Chase just closed my account for no reason, I went to deposit a check at an ATM and it said to contact customer service, they said I "posed a risk" couldn't tell me why just told me my account was suspended and that they would mail me what was in my account within 7-10 business days!
Didn't know they could close your account without notice or reason, ridiculous!
