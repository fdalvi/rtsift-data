Sixteen years with Keith and still going strong.
Always accomodating...right up to the last minute.
Consistent, excellent results in a relaxed setting.
Brilliant work with color and keratin treatments.
Can't imagine going anywhere else.

Lucky for me......I found Keith.
He is incredibly talented.
Love my cut & he is incredible with highlights!

I have been a client of Keith's for over 16 years.
Keith does color, highlights, cut and style to keep my hair looking it's best.
When I leave the salon, I feel so good about how my hair looks and especially love the compliments I receive.
What is nice about the salon is, it's just the client and Keith.
So many salons have too many people working on your hair; a person to bring you a drink; a person to wash; a person to color; a person to cut and lastly a person to style.
Keith does it all!
