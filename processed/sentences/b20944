I first encountered Pace Print when I was attempting to produce a large amount of flyers for a student society I am involved with.
Rushing into Pace Print, I asked the very friendly and helpful member of staff what i thought was going to be an impossible task - I needed 400 flyers in two days.
Amazingly enough, Pace Print was able to do it with no trouble at all, which was a pleasent suprise.
However the cost of this was pretty high and I felt that if it were not for the speed that I needed the flyers, and I had had a chance to shop around, I would not have chosen Pace Print.
For more personal use, Pace Print offers printers that specialise in party invertations etc and business cards - even t-shirts.
Unfortunatly the price of all this is still expensive, and while the service is fast and friendly, the cost of all this is too much.

My printer won't connect to my laptop.
It's really annoying.
It means I can't print simple documents.
What do I do when I need these simple documents?
I was worried that requesting a printing job for 40 sheets in black and white would seem too small.
Not for Pace Print.
They happily printed off 20 sheets, one-sided, black and white and then another 20 sheets black-and-white double-sided, at the grand total of Â£6.
Sure it's more expensive than if I had my printer up and running, but I was in a pickle and they happily did this for me.
Kudos to the staff member who served me.
He was really friendly and helpful.
I simply had to email them a PDF of my document and they emailed me once it was printed and ready to collect (in around half an hour).
I really couldn't fault the service at all.
