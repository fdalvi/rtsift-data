Gotten my haircut twice here and he consistently does a great job....and for $10, can't go wrong.
Just don't ask him about politics.

Jose did a great job, was quick, it's cheap, and the conversation is great.
No complaints.
You will feel better by going here

Great little place to get a haircut.
Jose did a great job cutting my hair and I will be going back.
I will also be bringing my boys here to get their hair cuts as well.
