I like Z Gallerie.
If for nothing other than checking out their displays for arrangement ideas for my place.
I like the color schemes and the way that some of the furniture arrangements.
The associates are helpful to where I sometimes feel bad for pretending to be shopping when I'm just looking for the next way I'm doing my bedroom or dining room.
Anyway, the prices aren't bad when things are on sale - considering most Z Gallerie's are in malls.
And considering it's furniture, most stores are clean and organized because it's not like a shopper can just pick up a bed or couch, walk around with it then leave it some where because they don't want it.

I'm a fan of their home offerings and have been back over the last few years to find new ideas to add to my home as well as once when starting over.
The prices are a little outlandish sometimes, but you can find some particularly good bargains when things go on sale.
The furniture that I've bought here (a desk and a bed) were of really good quality and the prices were great.
The bedding that I've bought is hit-or-miss; look at the floor samples closely and you can get a decent idea of how some of it will wear (their small stitching always seems to snag and/or come undone).
Look at the tags too because a lit of the stores don't stock everything in every color; they'll order it for you though!
