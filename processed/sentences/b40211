Ask for Ken he is an Amazing nail sculpture and can do just about anything!
I only have him do my nails so I can only speak for his work.
I wanted a set of pink and whites and I explained I wanted the pink very dark, he did gel and used a very dark hot pink which was perfect!
The work and effort he puts into my nail creation is incredible, he takes his time and is a perfectionist which I love!
I am so spoiled by his work I refuse to go anywhere else so if he gives up the nail profession in the future I will be screwed!
I will post a photo next time for sure as I have been so busy during my birthday month that I totally forgot.
Don't forget to ask for Ken!
Go ahead girl and get your nails did!
lol

Last minute before I head out to an event, I needed to have my nails done.
I drove by Rainbow Nails and decided to give it a try.
Met with Diana(owner).she was so kind and squeezed me into her tight schedule.
And in half an hour ---my nails look awesome!
This is my new nails shop to go from now on!everyone should chk out this place.

So happy to find that Diana from Luxury Nails now has her own shop.
She is meticulous and always does a phenomenal job on my gels.
My nails look fabulous for weeks.

I havie been going to Diana for a number of years and thrilled she has her own shop.
She does an amazing job on my feet and nails.

Was looking for a place nearby while getting my car fixed.
Found Rainbow Nails on Yelp so I called.
They got me in with 10 minutes notice.
Ken did a fill for me and painted an awesome pink and black flower.
In and out in under an hour.
Was very impressed with this shop.
Bad news is that now I will have a bit of a drive from home to get my nails done.
I'll give them a little more notice that I'm coming next time, but I'll definitely be asking for Ken!
