I went to this establishment a few years ago after a looooooooong night of debauchery during my buddies bachelor party.
It's an Asian massage parlor....in Las Vegas....and it's open 24 hours a day.
Bingo!
To my surprise, these beautiful babies actually gave me and my buddies a pretty descent massage.
Granted, it was 4:30 in the morning and we were completely plastered, but it totally relieved my sore shoulder from pulling those slot machines all weekend.....uh, yeah....
I cannot confirm, nor deny any naughty activity within my group of drunk 20-somethings that morning...but I will tell you that my masseuse offered me something called a "body shampoo" for an additional $30 at the end of my rub down.
I think I blacked out, because that's the last thing I remember before waking up naked in my hotel room at the Luxor.
Gotta love Vegas.

Yup I got a massage here.
It was epic and I had no idea it was an alleged "brothel.
" I can't believe Ruggy has been here too.
I feel weird about it, but ultimately indifferent.
I haven't been there in about 5 years but I thought about it today for some reason and learned it's part of a string of happy ending and unlicensed goodness.
Probably won't be back ever but oh those Las Vegas memories.

hey...after losing a few black chips on damn BJ table and downing about 25 shots of Patron, my buddies and I (well actually just me) was feeling lonely.
so the cure for this?
oh ya!
it's Vegas so i headed over to this place just expecting the usual Happy Ending...well i be damn!!
i got much more than that!
i cant tell u what because I dont want to get my self arrested since i have a job i need to keep.
anyways this is a cool place.
okbye
