I really love this place, I have my own washer & dryer at home but come here to clean my blankets and sheets etc.
It really does a great job and it's very high tech with their card system.
I was a little worried about the location of this place at first but after being there two times I no longer worry about it.
I always see the attendant lady cleaning all the machines picking up trash keeps the bathrooms clean etc.
Also if you check in on Yelp while you are there you get free dry with your wash!
I love the extra big machines

Friendly attentive service.
$2 for a small wash load that take about 23 mins.
Small load dries in about 30 mins for $4.
Why have I never thought about taking my comforters to a laundromat instead of dry cleaning or sticking in my machine at home with tennis balls bouncing in the dryer?
I can't believe I was in and out in less then 45 mins after washing and drying a small load.
