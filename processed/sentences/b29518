I hate giving a 1 star but I have to.
I was shopping and needed a little treat for me and my toddler..so I thought a cinnamon pretzel would be perfect.
I should have known when I saw the girl DUNK the whole pretzel in the butter it was gonna be bad.
Then she covered it in a half inch layer of cinni-sugar.
When we sat down I had to scrape off ALL the topping and what I was left with was a horrible artery clogging nightmare.
I tried a bite and was not pleased.
I had to let the little guy try a piece cuz he was very aware of the "treat".
He actually spit it out.
He never does that..he eats everything..even sushi!
I should have went back for a refund but had to get the boy something stat before he flipped out.
So we went to Nestle for a cookie...

I love the cinnamon pretzels never had a bad experience at this place.
I happen to like the extra amount of butter and cinnamon they put on the pretzels.

Whenever I go shopping in this location I always grab a pretzel dog.
