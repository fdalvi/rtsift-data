Togo's is not the place to go if you want a veggie sub.
I can't comment on the quality of the meats but their vegetarian options are boring.
What's the point of a cheddar cheese sub if they can't toast it?!?
Oh, the humanity!

One of the best sandwich shops I've ever been to.
The sandwiches are actually as big as advertised, you can barely fit your mouth around them!
I highly recommend the Turkey and Avocado.
Friendly staff, a little pricey, but well worth it!

Togo's is the best for Sub's as for Vegetarian.
When I want an opinion about Veggies I will ask a rabbit!
