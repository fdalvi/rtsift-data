I really enjoyed working with Ed at the Tempe store.
He was extremely helpful and patient while I was making my decision.
I bought one rug and will return to by a rug for another room.
Thank you for your great customer service.

Great experience!
Greg was very knowledgeable and was willing to price match a rug I had been eyeing at another store.
I even learned a thing or two about the history of Persian rugs and how they can truly be a work of art.
I will be back to buy all my rugs at Arizona Rug!

We picked out an area rug that we liked.
It was the right design and size.
When we got it home and started cutting the pad we realized that the size of the rug was smaller than the labels read.
It was about 4 inches less in both directions.
When we brought this to the owners attention, he said he had never had that happen before.
Uh huh and the moon is made of cheese.
He could not imagine why a rug manufacturer would want to change the measurement.
Welllll how about they can charge more for a larger rug.
He never offered to refund any money.
He was so surprised this had happened.
Hard to believe!
Won't go back.

We've looked at rugs for several months, at various stores throughout the Phoenix area.
Brought home rugs from 2 different stores to see how they looked in our home.
Arizona Rug Company, Scottsdale location and Greg in particular, never pressured us to buy; in fact he remembered us from several months ago when we first began the process.
Other companies we looked at or brought rugs home to check out kept the pressure on...."What can I do to get you to buy this rug?
"  The rug from AZ.
Rug Co. fit our space, was the right colors, and worked into our budget.
Purchasing a hand knotted rug is a big investment.
We feel that AZ Rug Co. offered us an honestly priced rug and we were treated fairly by Greg.
Love the colors, love the size...it will last our family for many years to come.
Thanks AZ Rug Co.
