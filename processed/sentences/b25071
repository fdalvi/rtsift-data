I'll start with the positive.
They have some friendly members of staff.
That's it.
You might catch a staff infection here, so watch out.
It's like a shack that somehow got a bar licence.
I have a friend who drags me here on occasion as it's his favourite dive.
It's one wrong glance away from a fight, every time.
If you like the danger and excitement of drinking a beer in a building that may collapse on you, go for it.
If not, avoid the dregs of society and go somewhere else.

First off, we all know first impressions are what count.
My first impression.....welcome to your new home!
My husband and i recently moved to AZ from WA.
Called the bar to see what entertainment was offered on a friday night.
The bartender/owner introduced herself and invited us over.....great fun, great drinks, great people.....GREAT first night out in AZ!

This bar is a hidden little gem in Goodyear/Avondale.
I love dive bars & this is my favorite one in Arizona so far.
Everything is so far if you're on the westside.
Some guy wrote a review about getting a staff infection & close to getting into a fight each time.
I have no idea if he was writing about the same place.
It's a local bar with with 2 pool tables & a jukebox (which is pretty awesome).
The drinks are cheap & the bartender is friendly.
I wouldn't come here to mingle or a night on the town.
Its a good place to unwind, have a drink, listen  to music and relax.
