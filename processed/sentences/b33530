Hollye and her photographs are truly incredible.
I interviewed several photographers  for my wedding this year and am so happy Hollye was available.
Just by looking at her work, compared to others, you realize she is an artist rather than a picture snapper.
Not only are her photos to die for, but she makes you feel so comfortable when she shoots.
She has a gift.
I cannot say enough positive things about Hollye and would recommend her to anyone that is interested in having moments captured  that they can cherish for the rest of their lives.

Hollye did an absolute smashing job captured our wedding over a year ago.
I know, I know - it's a big day, and expectations are sky high.
But with Hollye, we had the ultimate confidence she would snap each and every stolen moment and then some.
Not only do we look like shining stars in all our pics, but our guests do too.
She even gently coached my husband on how to kiss for the pics (less pursing of the lips, perhaps?
), which led to lots of laughs and great candids.
We couldn't have been more comfortable with her and her discreet team.
Our images are seriously sharp, creative, and magazine-worthy thanks to Hollye.
Only challenge is narrowing down the hundreds of drop dead gorgeous images to build our dream album!
Thank goodness she's there to hold our hand through that, too.

Hollye is a TRUE talent.
Talent like hers is rare and worth every penny.
I am BEYOND happy with how everything turned out.
Every wonderful moment of our sepcial day was captured and perfectly shot.
There is not one bad thing that I could say about the experience!
