I will only go here!
I'm a chicken to mouth pain even at my age!
Dr. Greding puts up with my cowardly ways and knows that it's fear more than anything.
I'm respected by the staff, well cared for, and they call you after the procedure and check on you.
This is during their family time and personal time.
Thank you Dr. Wallingford and Dr. Greding for all you do!
And associates and staff!

Amazing in all ways!
Dr. Greding is super awesome!
He is very friendly and personable, and great at his work!
We had some fun pulling some teeth last week 05/30/2014.
I personally don't have any issues with teeth being pulled and I don't have a fear in dentists, so that helps.
But Dr. Greding is great at keeping you calm and understanding all the steps that happen with your treatment.
He even checked up on me afterwards.
We had a good laugh about my swelling.
He is very passionate about what he does, and it shows in his overall care and treatment towards everyone.
While I'm not your average dental client (I overall enjoyed and was awake during my teeth being pulled.
), I still would recommend Aesthetic to anyone!
Everyone is very friendly, the whole office is always clean and super cold.
I like super cold.
If you aren't a fan of cold, definitely bring something to cover up!
Definitely a great place to go for dental work!
