Most awesome used bike shop ever.
I have friends that have built entire motorcycles out of here.
Cheap prices, the guys are very busy, just go in and talk to one of the friendly faces over there and see for yourself.
I have saved so much money on parts, it is ridiculous.
Love this place.

$20 and 20 minutes to get two tires mounted and balanced, as well as some angled valve stems put in (which I provided.. although they provide regular valve stems at like $1-2/pop).
That is just ridiculous.
Excellent service, great pricing, and a super friendly staff make Bob's the place to go.
I'll be sure to come here again for all future parts and services.

I needed a new starting motor for my 1981 Kawasaki.
They had one!
It took a little time to find one, but I am guessing they have one of everything even for a 30 year-old bike.
Everyone is extremely friendly and knowledgable.
If you don't know how to replace a part, they can definitely show you how.
They even test parts for you to make sure that the part you brought in was faulty.
I now need a new speedometer.
Bob's will see me again this week!

Worst customer service EVER.
LEARN TO ANSWER YOUR PHONES.
They never answer their phones, and if by some OFF chance they do, they say they have something and then when you go down there to pick it up, THEY DON'T HAVE IT.
Or anything remotely close to what you asked for in the first place.
Thanks but no thanks.
They will no longer be getting our business.

Eric is a great guy.
He is helpful and knowledgeable.
He always takes the time to talk with customers and seems to truly care about people's stories.
Also, if you need something he doesn't have in stock, he goes to great lengths to get it.
