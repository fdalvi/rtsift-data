Great barbers.

I have been getting my hair cut here for 12 years.
It's super basic.
They have had some Barber turn over - over the years, but they are reliable.
I pretty much say - "a one and a half on the sides blended... a little off the top and tapered in the back.
"  Then they cut my hair.
They still use a straight edge here, too.

What ever happened to no-nonsense barber shops?
Thanks to a little Yelp from my friends, I found this spot for a quick haircut on my way to work.
Simple old-school spot.
Nothing fancy.
Just a few old guys giving straight up hair cuts for a reasonable price.
What I liked the most is that they still break out a little hot shaving cream and the straight razor to clean up the neck and edges.
Then a little hot towel, and off you go!
Gotta love preservation of the art!

Although this place has the friendliest staff I've encountered at a barber shop, the cut I received was short of okay!
Great friendly atmosphere and some funny barbers to chat with.
Unfortunately, I do not see myself returning due to a not so nice haircut and a price that shocked me when I reached the register to pay.
