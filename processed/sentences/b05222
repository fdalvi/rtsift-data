Friendly service!
They pack your veggies too.
:) wish they still offered $5 footlong deal for every sandwich..

Friendly service.
The food looks fresh and tasty.
They get you in and out quite quickly.
Clean establishment.
They also have a few tables to sit at or you can carry it out.
They also cater.

I really like this subway!
They are all very nice.
Everytime I go in I see someone cleaning, which makes me feel confident that the restaurant is hygienic.
They aren't stingy with the veggies which I love!
I make the choice to come here instead of the other subway down the street.

this'll be a lackluster review, but what can I say about one of the most popular sandwich chains?
Their breakfast deals are one of the best, and I wish they had a drive-thru here to make it more accessible.
A flat bread sandwich and a coffee or drink for $3 is something that can't be beat.
Get it!

Had the Philly cheese stake sandwich.
It was all right .am so full right now !
Lol  The customer service great no hassle on how we wanted the sandwiches .
The employee was friendly .

Stopped in at subway for a cheap bite not expecting much...
But this location was clean the food was fresh and staff was friendly!
