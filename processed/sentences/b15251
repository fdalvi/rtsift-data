This place used to be good.
Unfortunately it is not anymore, I started going there with Lee Ann she seeemed good the first and second time, and then,  the last times she did not do a good job, took a lot of time, did lots of things without caring aobut my hair, and finally the last time I paid a lot to have to get out of there with my hair wet because it took her so long.
So  it happens at first they do their best and then, they just do not care.
This is the tye.

I had my hair colored and cut today by Charlie and she was fabulous!
She understood what I hoped to achieve in long lasting hair style that fit my personality and lifestyle.
The salon has a great vibe and loyal clients.

I LOVE working here.
Such a great staff and everyone is SO supportive of each other.
