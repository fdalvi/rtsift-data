Local joint.
Great prices.
Excellent service.
Had a great time for Superbowl here.

Ok food.
Ok service.
Left smelling horrible of cigarette smoke.

The servings were huge and reasonably priced.
Great service!
Definitely making a return trip.

Friendly local's joint that emphasis cleanliness.
I've been to hospitals that are dirtier than BL.
First class video viewing den for the big game.
Always has a $2 beer deal.
The pub grub cheap eats menu is pretty good.
Makes a mockery of joints like PT's on Nellis.
Seems that many people like the action on the slots there.
Despite previous reviewers comments about cigarette smoke the ventilation system is especially excellent for a locals joint.

my wife and i were regular patrons of this bar for past year and a half.
2 months ago we went there for drinks and entertainment.
went to use their atm machine - machine malfunctioned and did not dispense the money or receipt.
bartender was informed and following day the had repairs done.
ended up our bank (chase) took out the money anyway.
we filed a complaint and the returned the money then 2 months later we get a letter saying they are going to take it back.
found out bar is telling them that there was no problem with the atm.
my wife went to the bar to talk to glen (manager) and he basically told her that we took the money.
my wife and i have spent plenty of money there and to be accused of wrongdoing is bs.
pretty sad that the bar and bank has to take our money.
we will no longer be going to the bar and will be changing banks.
future patrons beware.
