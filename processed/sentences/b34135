I took my daughter in there with a soar throat and after 2 hours went back there to see what was going on and she was sleeping on the table so i woke her and asked where the doctor was and she had no clue.I asked where the doctor was and they said she had an emegency.Good thing i was there or she would have gotten locked up inside for the night.I left and they said they would find out whats was wrong and call in a perscription and we still have no clue.I have to take her somewhere else now and pay again.I have been there many times and have never had bad service but after this forget it and they dont even seam to care

Made an appt online using my phone ahead of time.
No wait.
Came on a Wednesday evening.
Fast service.
Very nice, friendly, patient employees.
Was given a breathing treatment, chest x-Ray, my medication was called into the pharmacy for me.
I was never rushed.
I felt listened to.

My overall experience was positive.
We were there right at opening, filled out paperwork, processed our co-pay, sat down for maybe 30 seconds and then was called back.
My daughter's vitals were taken, doctor came in to do initial exam, went back for X-rays, and then back to the room to speak with the doctor and PA. Easy enough.
The reason why I only have 4 stars is because I felt like compassion was initially lacking when we first got there.
Maybe the individuals working this morning don't have much experience with children but I felt like there could have been more compassion towards her and her injury.
Maybe they were put off a little with us walking in right at opening...I don't know, but my first impression wasn't great but at the end of our visit, I did feel positive about the overall experience here.
I would definitely return if I needed urgent care.
