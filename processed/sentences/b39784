Come get your nails for New Year's.
You will be so amazed at how beautiful your nails and toes will be

Good job, good attitude, good customer service,  they don't sit and talk their language and laugh around customers.
They made me feel so welcomed .
I will definitely come back

Needed a last minute mani 530 on a Sunday, and despite closing at 6, Myloan still took me no problem.
Another girl walked in right at 6 asking for a pedicure, and she was happy to take her as well!
Very thankful for her.
I will be back :)
