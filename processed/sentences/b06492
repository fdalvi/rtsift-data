Been looking for new rugs for my kitchen floor, and since I wanted something with a Little padding, it was hard finding something to fit my expectation.
Then it hit me, try Anna's.
At first, I walked the floor looking at the inventory and was surprised by the cost, it seems reasonable.
For someone who likes to sew and often do sew my own curtains, I was impressed with the quality of the fabrics used.
I found want I was looking for, and after reviewing the cost of new towels, will be back before year of year for new bathroom sets.
This place is worth looking at for linens.

Great Service, some good deals.
I loved shopping there.
The attendants were so nice .

Bedsheets, comforters, pillows and blankets.
Here is a large selection of colors, styles, and quality.
If you are looking for a purple bathroom set, with everything to match, this is your place.
Today, I came looking for a new king size bed pillow, feather, and some extra pillow cases.
There are at least 8 different styles of pillows to choose from.
I was happy with the standard hotel style.
I quickly found some extra cases and once again pleased with the cost.
You should check this place, there are some good bargains to find here.

Most women like shopping for shoes and clothes.
However I am a fan of sheets, towels, and comforters.
Yes, I have a large collection because I am always changing my theme.
Somehow I was searching for the craft store and I came across Anna's Linens.
They had a sale for 500 thread sheets so i had to buy several sets as well as a new downs-comforter since it is cold in vegas.
I will be return after the holidays to buy more things for my new place.
