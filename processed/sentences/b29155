While still on my quest for the best cupcakes in town and I stumble across this place while walking Meadows Mall, and it's great!
Moist, tasty cupcakes from a small homegrown company making their way from a tiny little stall in the mall.
Amazing and cheap at about $2.50/cupcake (we had mini cupcakes on the strip that cost more)!
We tried the strawberry cream cheese and red velvet, both moist and yummy.
To give the full 5 stars the red velvet would need a tad more chocolate flavor and a smidge more frosting-- but overall I would definitely visit this place again and I'm looking forward to trying other flavors.

Located in Meadows Mall, upstairs in the food court, Cupcake Cafe caught my eye.
Overall, the cupcakes were pretty good!
It's about $2.49 for a babycake (regular size cupcake), and $3.95 for a King Size cupcake (a really tall cupcake, about two cupcakes in one).
So I take my first bite of the strawberry shortcake which is white cake with strawberry frosting.
The cake was moist and the frosting was okay just a little too much for me.
I also ordered the red velvet, it was good!
But the only downfall I can say about this place is the paper bags they put it in if you get it togo.
Pretty much the cupcakes get all messed up!
I sure hope they get some togo containers like every other cupcake place.

check their facebook page cause the last i looked, their meadows mall location was closed :(
