Cilantro Rack in conveniently located downstairs from my office off of Silverado Ranch and Maryland Parkway in the Smith's shopping center.
It opened in late March, and I decided to check it out during a lunch break.
It's a Mom and Pop type of deal that specializes in discounted clothing and accessories.
This store kind of reminds me of a Factory 2 U.
It's not as "dirty" as Fallas Parades, but definitely not a Burlington's or TJ Maxx.
They offer clothing for women of all sizes and men as well.
I did see a couple of decent brands in the store, and nothing was priced over $19.99.
I am personally not a fan of the clothing they sell, but they clerk did say they did get new stuff in all the time.
An update may be coming soon.

I can't get my leg in any of this stuff.
So I guess if your a small petite size women, this store might work for you!
Only thing I could fit is a purse!
lol

I love their summer dresses, i bought like 8 of them, nice cotton fabric and very well prices!
I actually had the change to meet the owner and they were super nice!
I do have to say most of the other stuff didn't fit me, since I'm an XL, but their summer dresses are fantastic!

I love the clothes here.
You can buy anything for anyone of all ages.
They have styles for all ages: women, teens/juniors for boys and girls, a small section for kids, men, there's also a section for people who wear plus sizes.
The clothes they have are very good quality brands for up to 60% off!
From formal to casual to work attire to swimwear and more, I think they have it all!
The staff are really friendly and helpful.
I would definitely recommend anyone to stop by and check It out.
