Lol.
The first review really.
What to say about a place I use to work at for 5 or 6 years.
Beep beep beep.
Lol jk.
I saw that their store signs was light up the other night so I guess they're still open.
I always shop at office depot for my office supplies but not at this location.
It is in a bad location because there aren't a lot  businesses around them.
For customers coming into the store use the door on the left/west side of the building, there are a lot of customers who mistakenly use the doors of OD to get to the store next door or the other stores doors to get to OD.
For customers waiting for their cars at terribles checkout the restaurants around the corner they're pretty good.
Last time there they had dirty restroom and water fountain.
But customer service was good.

I love this Office Depot because the people are so friendly in here and the service is fast.
I don't come here often, but whenever I walk in I'm greeted by at least 3 people and it's not just a simple "hello.
" It's normally, "Hello, how are you doing today?
Can I help you find anything?
We have lots of items on sale today in that section over there.
" The people working in the print area are also very fast and know what they're doing.
It's not like other office supply stores where I have to walk them through the process of printing out my papers step by step.
I simply just tell them I want everything in the "print" folder printed, one each, black and white, and they have it ready for me within a few minutes.
As I walk out the door, I'm usually thanked for coming and wished a great day.
If the customer service were like this at most other office supply stores, I'd be a very happy camper.

Worst Office Depot ever.
The employee at the copy center doesn't know how to change the copy machine from Legal to letter size.
He was extremely rude.
