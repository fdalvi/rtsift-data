I have known Chelsea for a couple of years;  seen numerousl people who she colors their hair and it looks great.
Her haircuts and styles are also fabulous, our whole family benefits from her talent.
She is a fantastic lady who is fun loving, hilarious and compassionate.
On top of all this her prices are very reasonable, you have to give her a try.
You'll love her!!

I am the happy owner of a new pair of lucious lashes!
They look amazing and I am officially hooked.
Thanks Chelsea, I look forward to seeing you in 10 days for my fill.
(She has an incredible offer for 3 fills per month.
) That means, they will look perfect all month long.. Every time I bat my lashes, I will think of you.

I just got an amazing haircut and style from Chelsea, she listened to everything I said and asked questions to be sure I got exactly what I wanted.
Her shop is so cute and she was friendly and really talented!
Thanks Chelsea, you'll definitely see me again :)

Ever leave the salon looking and feeling like a million bucks, only to wash and style it yourself and realize you can't maintain the look?
Yeah, used to happen to me too.
Now that I go to Chelsea at Glass Hair & Lash Bar, that doesn't happen anymore.
Not only does the style look great when I leave, but Chelsea always gives a style that I can maintain on my own.
She also did my "wedding hair" and looked stunning!
I would give her a million stars just for that alone.
I highly recommend this salon - You can't ask for better!!!
