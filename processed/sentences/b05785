I have been using chiropractors for 20+ years to heal injuries and just to generally stay healthy and aligned.
Dr. Youngblood is one of the best ever.
Her knowledge and concern is vast.
She has literally moved mountains (in my spinal column).
Plus, she is holistically oriented, her staff is bright and attentive, and her office is centrally located and very aesthetically pleasing.

Love her!
She is a friendly sensitive doctor with an holistic approach that I deeply appreciate.
Her staff is really friendly and I am very pleased with how I have been feeling.

My son Zac has been going to Dr. Youngblood for over a year.
He is 4 years old and suffers from Nut Allergies.
Dr. Youngblood is amazing with children!
Zac loves to see the "tickle doctor".
She does great adjustments and Zac has taken a liking to her kind ways.
She has been a DC for over 25 years and is very respected in the LV community.
If you are looking for a seasoned, professional and well respected chiropractor, I recommend Dr. Youngblood.
Her staff, Ilene and Porsche are always friendly and professional also.
