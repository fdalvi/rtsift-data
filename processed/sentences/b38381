Courtney you are the best!
She does waxing, facials, Reiki and more.
I went for a hydrafacial!
A elaxing environment.
Spa ish feel.
Dont be surprised her space is in a MD's office.
My skin felt soo smooth and soft after.
I really believe hydrafacial helps with my hyperpigmentation.
I wish I lived in Vegas so I could visit more often.
Courtney is soo attentive and kind.
You will love her energy!
Just go you will not be dissapointed!

I have been treated by several other reiki masters and I'm blessed to meet Courtney..
In addition to the skills that she has as a reiki master, Courtney is a very friendly, caring and a person full of energy..I trusted her from the first time I met her.. She always go an extra mile from what is required from her to do..  She has helped me with my emotional stability and with clearing the negativity that I suffer from..  As for her clinic, very clean, very relaxing and very friendly employees..
I made it a habit to go at least once or twice a week..
I highly recommend reiki with Courtney, u will never regret it!
