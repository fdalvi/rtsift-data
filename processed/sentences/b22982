This is a coffee roaster who provides beans to local coffee shops.
It is run by the affable Randall Denton, who used to be a barista and manager at the legendary Willow House.
Xanadu supplies a few local joints, like Sapna Cafe, and the coffee is delicious, and the rates are reasonable.
They also offer bags for the typical home coffee addict, and a subscription service.
I don't really know much about the bean process, so I'm going to stop myself here.
If you are a restauranteur looking for locally-roasted beans, or a coffee fiend who wants to support your local roaster, look this place up.

This is some amazing coffee.

This is some of the best locally roasted coffee.
Do yourself a favor and find out if your favorite coffee house uses them.

This review is about the Espresso Blend and the service - I have not tried any other blends as I drink mainly straight espresso so I'm very picky with the beans.
Randy is a great guy.
I buy a lb every week or two depending on my work travel schedule.
I explained I like very fresh beans and he has been very accommodating.
I call, ask when he is going to roast next and try to make sure I pick it up in a day or two after.
Now the beans...
Very good blend.
It is a light City Roast which, in my coffee geek-dom over the last 12 years, has shown that I prefer this style espresso roast.
The flavors are good with med complexity and it works well with milk drinks too... the milk does not kill the complexity.
It is an all-around good blend for both straight shots and milk drinks and I have made this my daily beans :)
