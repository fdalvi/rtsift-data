I didn't intend to eat here,I was going to the Burger King inside Palace Station but apparently they are closing everything down in here.
Burger King is closed, the Cafe is closing to become Denny's and you have Subway in the Sports Book left to get some cheap fast food.
Well this isn't a normal priced subway NO $5 footlongs here.
Since this is now the only place to grab a bite to eat quickly in the Palace Station there is a pretty good line to wait for your sub sandwich.
Nothing special just the same as other locations.
Cheap subs.

The sandwiches had a lot less greens and vegetables than I'm used to at Subways I've frequently eaten at in California.
Also didn't have any avocado...
Overall the sandwiches were of much poorer quality than I've come to expect from Subway.

How can you go wrong with freshly baked bread?
This isn't a bad choice if you're eating in corporate America.

NOW serving breakfast @subwayfreshbuzz made YOUR way!!!
CHEAP + good-not your typical Fast-Food!!
I love the whole wheat muffins and being able to load it up anyway you want depending on what mood you are in.

Expectations aren't too high for a 24 hour Subway within a casino, but perhaps if the employees weren't male and facing the screens of the sports book, service would be more attentive.
Visited this weekend while a major game was playing, wanting to grab a pizza- Subway pizza is delicious, try one if you haven't already.
Employee was polite but incredibly slow.
Between carrying on a conversation with his coworker and staring at the game screen, the guy barely had the capacity left to focus on making my order.
It was simple, too.
Received it finally, hot and delicious.
Only complaint is that veggies were not chopped up prior to adding to the pizza- other locations have cut them into smaller pieces, as for the salads, before baking, but not here.
Giant pieces of pepper and onion tore up the cheese as I ate my individual pieces.
