They have a good variety of scrubs to choose from and they also have nurse accessories (i.e.
shoes, bags, stethoscope, pens) which was a plus...a one-stop-shop for nurses and anyone who wears scrubs on a daily basis.

Nice selection of scrubs and excellent customer service!

"You'll be required to wear a white lab coat", in my brain translates to, "You'll have to go to work in a shapeless sack that will make you look like a marshmallow with legs".
Nooooo!
After calling multiple places that sell lab coats, but don't have a single one in stock for you to try on, I came upon this place.
They had 4 different styles of lab coats in stock, ready to be modeled, lol.
I found 3 that where cinched at the waist 'YAY!!
" and 2 fit, so I walked out a happy camper.
If I must look like a marshmallow, it will be like a marshmallow with a waist & plenty of pocket space :)  Added bonus: This place has extended hours & on most days closes at 9 pm!
Check their website for the exact days.

Went here today,friendly and quick service with a lot of availability for males.On top of the fact that's it conveniently located right off the 101 and Northern.
Recommending indeed.

Service was beyond excellent!
The 2 ladies who helped me were just the sweetest!
I came in looking for a specific color of scrub pants for my uniform, and they helped me pick the size and everything.
I will definitely go back when I decide to purchase more scrubs!
