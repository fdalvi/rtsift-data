Imagine'at Photography is AMAZING!!!
They have now done two shoots for our family:  One when we were a family of 3.5 and the second as a family of 4.
Daniel and Danie are incredibly flexible, talented, and genuinely warm.
They are a pleasure to work with.
It can be very difficult to capture great photos of children.
Daniel captured the spirit of both of my girls and also of the sister love that ties them together.
Their pics evoke emotion and truly warm your heart.
There are so many options from which to choose and each one tells a different story.
Daniel has an amazing eye for photography and comes up with wonderful ideas to convey the spirit of our family.
They also communicate very well, get back to you very quickly when questions are asked, and deliver their products within a timely manner.
I have been nothing but pleased with both of our photo shoots and look forward to updating our family photos in 2014!
