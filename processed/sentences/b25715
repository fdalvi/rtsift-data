Finally!
I've found a place to buy quality bras.
Nothing makes me more irate than when I shell out $50 for a bra at VS and the under wire pokes out a month later.
I don't have that issue with Soma's bras though, they make them strong enough for a man but ph balanced for a woman.... er... something like that.

I'm sure the quality of Soma products are fine but I wouldn't know.
I've been to this location twice leaving without buying anything because no one ever offers to help.
I went with the intention of buying at least three new bras.
I told the sales lady i didn't know what my size was since having kids/nursing.
She didn't offer to size me or help.
Please, don't waste you time with this location.
