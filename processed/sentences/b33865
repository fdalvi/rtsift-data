I'm so glad I found an honest and inexpensive place I can take my car to I took my car in for an oil change and a transmission drain +refill, and they finished the job within a couple of minutes.
There was absolutely no waiting time because the mechanic was so quick and efficient.
Not just that, they rotated my tires and checked my tire pressure for free.
My car runs better than it's ever run before now.
This place is the only place I will bring my car from now on.
The tricky thing about this place is that it is located behind a few restaurants, so it's a little hard to find.

The best thing about coming to Chinatown district for auto repair is that it costs half the price of auto repair services anywhere else in the valley.
This place is a little difficult to find because it's located behind the Tofu Hut restaurant.
It's not very visible from the streets.
What I like the best about BUSY BUGGY is that they answer questions, and they answer the questions honestly.
They don't feed you misleading information like 99% of the other auto repair places do.
For example, many of the other auto repair places will say things like: "You must only use the specific Transmission Fluid that your car's factory produces or your engine will DIE.
That's why we gotta charge you more because we can't use a generic brand.
" Now everyone who does their own auto repairs at home knows that is bullsh!t.
I've been using a generic transmission fluid for the last 90k miles and my car runs like it's new.
Here at BB motors, they won't lie to you like they would at the other auto repair shops.
What makes this place especially great is that they do every kind of repair.
When my  engine light came on while driving to California, I first went to a guy in Orange County(Larry's Auto Repair), and he quoted me at around $4000 to fix it.
I drove over here and the guy comes back to me a few minutes later and tells me it was from a previous "misfire" and that the car's computer system was merely getting confused and that no repairs were necessary.
HOLY SH!T!!
Now that's one honest guy!!!!
He saved me $4000!!!
And he said that even if my engine was having the type of problem that the previous scammer claimed, it would never cost that much.
I will admit that I hate having to take my car in for an oil change.
I'm one of those guys who needs to do it himself.
Changing my own oil at home is actually one of my hobbies, and I used to look forward to it every 3 months.
But, I recently moved into a community in the Providence district of Las Vegas that provides no garage or space where I can jack up my car and change my oil.
So nowadays I have no choice but to bring it in.
The pros of bringing my car in to BUSY BUGGY for an oil change is that it actually costs less!
If I purchased 4 quarts of Quaker State(the least expensive), and an oil filter, it would come out to around $18.00.
Here at BB I think it was like $12.00 for 4.5 quarts of high quality Castrol, oil filter, and they even check your air pressure, rotate you tires, fill your wiper fluid, check all fluid levels, and check your air filter, all for free.
That's a great deal!
Customer service is great.
It's like being at one of those 1950's full service garages from the old movies.
The workers are all dressed nice and clean, and everything in the shop is so well organized.
I've never seen such a spotless garage before.
I can't believe how fast they get your car onto the lift.
At all the other auto repair shops, they let your car sit in the parking lot for a while, and then some extremely obese guy covered in motor oil, waddles out to your car all lethargically.
Usually it takes him about 5 minutes just to walk from the entrance of the garage to your car.
Here at BB, the moment you drop your car off, they sprint out, jump in, and jack it up for repairs.
It literally looks like those Nascar maintenance guys working on your car.
5-Stars and my favorite Auto Repair shop in the world.

A great shop for quality and affordable auto service.
It is the honest staff and affordable services that bring me back time after time, not to mention the complimentary snacks and refreshments in the lobby!

At first I was skeptic if I should take my car there.
Being I've been scammed when I bought the car from a private seller in the first place.
But what the heck!
The office was extremely clean (and it smelled nice too!
) something you might not expect from a repair shop.
Refreshment bar was well stocked & I mean REALLY well stocked.
Hmmm, not your typical repair shop AGAIN.
and they have a CLEAN bathroom!
Imagine that!
AGAIN, not typical for a car repair shop.
With that said, let's get down to the real deal..  Mr. Hamid (I'm guessing he's the licensed lead mechanic) was very welcoming.
Received us timely & was very attentive to our concerns about the car.
I was telling him the details & I guess he figured out that i was upset about the car being a junk, he told me they'll check the car out & tell me what's wrong.
Offered me some refreshments & magazines while I wait.
He came back saying something's off with the transmission.
What?!
TRANSMISSION?!
I almost fainted!
Man!
One thing over the other, quoted me the amount me the amount I expected -- but still I was like, lemme look around..  Got a second opinion & boy!!
They quoted me 4x as much for the same problem BUSY BUGGY diagnosed my car for!
Long story short, took my car back to them & after 2days, whoollaaa!!!
My car started running like brand new!!
Plus, it included 1 year warranty!!!
Damn!!
One whole year!!
I'm a fan!!
Spreading the word over the valley.
This is the to go place if you want QUALITY & HONEST service.

Good service, cheap price and clean office with free soda, cookies and ice-cream!!!!!

I drove from LA, and noticed my oil change mileage was about due.
I had some extra time and decided to be productive and looked up on Yelp for an oil change place.
Just like the other reviewers' positive reviews, i am glad i came.
They had a great oil change special going on for synthetic, and replaced my worn out wipers.
All this for a great, hassle free Price!
I am one satisfied customer.
I just wish they were 250 miles closer to my home.

Great place to take care of you baby cars.
Hamid is such a nice guy.
He's polite and knowledgeable.
He always takes the time to explained what is happening with the car even when it gets really complicated.
My friend's car was unable to start due to a messed up starter.
It was 10 minutes until they close.
Even so, Hamid came over and checked on the car almost immediately.
He told us that he is closing late today because he got a lot of work to finish.
I was really impressed because he took the time to check on us despite the busy schedule.
The car was up and running the second day.
My friend's starter has always been a pain in the butt and the previous garage never really completely fixed it.
This time, however, it was a smooth start up.
The car was running perfect.
Lets just say I usually don't expect legit car services around Chinatown area.
You don't have too many technicians take the time and explain everything you need to know about the services that are done on your car.
Busy Buggy is very big on communication and everyone takes the time to make sure you have a thorough understanding of what's going on.
The waiting lounge is one of the best i've ever seen.
It has a huge TV which is usually playing clips of general car repair knowledge and there are a variety of refreshments, snacks, even ice creams you can indulge on while you wait in a spotless environment.
Busy Buggy is pretty new.
I think it's less than 1 year old.
I really loved this place and give them a chance you will too!

Simply honest and hard working.
Detailed and not over priced, will be my mechanic forever.

Today I was in need of getting an oil change and received a coupon in the mail for a few places, including Busy Buggy.
I decided to check it out.
I am quite a skeptic when it comes to oil changes, because I have time and time again had shops try to sell me things that I did not need or in some cases do damage to the car...
So I went into it unsure what was going to happen.
My experience here was fantastic though!
I would certainly recommend this wonderful place to anyone in need of service for your car.
It was a great deal, and the only thing recommended for me that might be replaced was my wiper blades (which I already knew were in bad shape), and it was very reasonable so I decided to do that too.
Super quick, and the waiting room was the best I have ever waited in!
Free drinks (anything you could want), cookies, and even free ice cream.
Heck yeah!
Amazingly clean and a wonderful place to wait the short time while my car was being taken care of.
Both of the gentlemen I spoke with were very helpful and were easily able to answer any of my random questions.
I can tell that they know their stuff and are honest (which is something I value very much in a repair shop).
I will be back here for my car needs without a doubt as long as I am still living in Las Vegas!

Written After I checked my car myself..
This place is ridiculous.
I'm very disappointed.
I wrote a good review for them because I thought everything was great until I noticed my car was leaking oil.
My car ended up missing two screws on the oil pan!
I don't know if they forgot to put it back on or they took it off on purpose because there is no way that those screws can go missing if no one messed with it.
My dad is a mechanic and we maintain my car but I wanted to get an oil change at this place because it'll be cheaper than doing it myself.
I just want to say this place is a bit sketchy.
Make sure to check your car before and after getting an oil change at this place.
Written Before I checked my car myself....
Yesterday I stopped by and got a quick oil change.
It was great because even though they were busy, as soon as they saw me pull up they acknowledge me and asked what they can help with me.
I appreciate that they did that.
The oil change took like 15 minutes and it only cost me $18.99!!
It was a synthetic oil change too!
Not only that it was a quick and inexpensive oil change, they gave me a quick diagnostic check of my car.
Told me what I can and should replace on my car.
I really like this shop and I promise they will not disappoint you.

Hamid the owner really caters to his customers.
I first walked in and pleasantly surprised to find that it was comparable to the Lexus dealership waiting room, on a smaller scale.
The waiting area is comfortable with a variety of beverages and even a small freezer for ice cream that is provided to the customers.
The bathrooms and lobby was very clean and comfortable.
For service, I only got an oil change but they were fast, VERY reasonable, and professional.
I have gone to 4 other automotive shops for a quote on my transmission and was told that it would cost anywhere from $3400-$4000.
Hamid gave me a quote of $2800.
I will definately come back and recommend that anyone looking  for automotive work, come here!

Great, courteous service!!!
Comfortable waiting area!
My car was taken in as soon as I arrived, I was treated with care and respect...will definitely tell my friends and family about the best kept secret in Vegas...Busy Buggy!

I was going on a road trip the next day, I needed an oil change.
They gave me a free diagnostic and told me I should change my timing belt before I go on my road trip (timing belt were making a squeaky noise before I brought in my van).
I took their advice and changed my timing belt too.
They have great customer service, not pushy, very friendly.

I found this place on yelp and I needed an oil change before driving home to SoCal.
$19.95 for a synthetic oil change?
Yes, please!
Took about 30 minutes and in the meantime I was in the waiting area enjoying my free drinks and fresh baked cookies.
FYI they also have coffee, tea and ice cream that's complimentary!
I will def come back here again.
Plus the front desk chica was super nice & friendly.

This place was amazing.
I went without an appointment, and there were a few cars ahead of me.
I was in and out in over an hour.
If you check in, it's $10 off your purchase.
They were however running another promotion.
I paid $26 for an oil change.
They checked out my car.
There were a few minor issues that they recommended getting fixed.
They even topped off my windshield fluid.
The receptionist was very friendly and very sweet.
She offered to make coffee or get beverages for another customer.
They offer complimentary drinks, cookies, and ice cream.

Awesome check-in deal and not so pricey to begin with... the receptionist was nice, they had free wi-fi and actual current magazines besides like Motorcycle Monthly and WebMD that you usually find at other auto repair places.
Big plus, they have tons of free stuff like water bottles, cookies, tea, ice cream, coffee, etc.

They people are amazing !!!!
Are real nice and make some amazing offer and you will now be disappointed do not hesitate to stop here and they will make sure everything is done correctly the break room is not boring they have a dvr moving to show to show and it's nice and not stale

after reading review after review I finally decided to take my car here because my traction control light kept coming on.
They took my car back and I waited.
While waiting, I watched Hamid with another customer that was there and he told him his car was not worth getting fixed and he could help him find someone to buy it for parts and he could maybe get something else.
How many mechanics say that?
They just take your money PERIOD and fix it, even if it's not worth it.
Hamid and Victor had my car diagnosed within an hour.
They gave me a list of immediate fixes and then some things that can be fixed down the line, no pressure to fix those.
I left it Friday afternoon.
They offered me a ride home, which I did not need and told me they would call me Saturday which they did.
I went to pick my car up and no sooner than I got on Spring Mountain my light came back on.
I turned right around and Hamid was so apologetic.
He said I could either leave the car and they can have it taken care of Monday (it was almost 6pm) or I could bring it on my lunch break Monday and they would take me back to work.
I got there Monday and Hamid and Victor told me that they know what the problem is and had gotten the part I needed Monday am and to just have a seat and they would have it done in no time.
Victor immediately took my car in and did what he had to do.
He drove it around the block and said that I should be good.
Its been 2 days now and I havent had any problems (knock on wood).
I called 2 other chain companies and their prices were almost double what Busy Buggy charged.
It's so hard to have an honest mechanic and I'm glad Ive found a great mechanic in the Vegas area.
Also the waiting area is small but very nice.
They have Keurig coffee maker, ice cream, cookies, soda and water all free of course :)

Fast and friendly customer service.
I got my oil changed with in 30 minutes.
The waiting area was extraordinary with all the amenities.
Will continue to repeat business and recommend to all .

I was hesitant about the prices for the oil change, but when you consider the quality of the oil and how long the oil change will last you, it's actually very reasonable.
Went in for a standard oil change, they have a special running for the synthetic blend.
The waiting area is really nice and clean, they had complimentary beverages, Keurig coffee choices, ice cream sandwiches, and cookies.
Lots of magazines for you to read too.
Receptionist was very nice and friendly.
At the end they give you recommendations for services, they weren't pushy about it either.
They changed my windshield wipers ($15) and brake light bulb ($15), saving me lots of time.
Great place, definitely going to come back.

Just went for my oil change they had a deal running which was a 6,000 mile oil change for $29 which is very reasonable but they also let me use the check in deal with it so my total was only $20!
Lets just say this is the cleanest car shop I have been in.
They were all nice and they offer free wifi also they give you complementary water, coffee, tea and even ice cream!
I am defiantly return.

Wow.
This place is like the Hilton of car service shops.
Great service, complimentary drinks, ice cream, fresh baked cookies, what more could anyone ask for.
Top it off, very reasonable prices.
Definitely will be back here.

I came here due to all the positive reviews.
I agree.
This place is a hidden secret.
For those of you who care about cleanliness this is the place to be.
They are very generous with all the free cookies, heehee.
I received free towing & free diagnostic check.
Thank you for getting my car up & running again!
At check out time I asked about their coupon I saw on their website & unfortunately it was not applicable to the work performed on my vehicle but the young lady gave me a discount anyways.
Very satisfied!

Great spot to get some work done while passing through Vegas... Fast, professional, and great snacks in the waiting room.
Highly recommended.

My car had an electrical fire under the hood on Thursday 4/17 and I had a rental car the next morning and they had my car delivered to me at work on Monday morning!!!!!!
However, I later needed a transmission.
I was without a car for several days due to them not being honest with me and letting me know that they had not called the warranty company to request an inspector to come out and look at the transmission to authorize the work.
The reason for this was because they had given my car to another company to install my transmission!!!!!!!!!
I was told that this company Zip Zap Auto was their sister company, and later found out it wasn't ..
When I got the rental car from Zip Zap Auto the car was on "E".
When I tried to call Hamid to ask questions about my car he avoided me and had the gate keeper Heather blocking all my calls to him.
I've never done business with an auto repair shop, who gives your car to another shop to repair and doesn't inform the customer about it or even ask the customer????
What's more, you then try to hide your actions by avoiding the customer calls!!!!!!
Smdh.
Was my car fixed by Zip Zap Auto?
Yes.
How do I rate Busy Buggy?
Sneaky and Deceptive.

On a weekend trip to vegas.
On the way to a night club on Easter my 2006 300c srt-8 Died on me late at night.
Long story short it was my alternator.
After checking yelp I came to this place.
They had great customer service unlike others I had called on yelp.
They were the closes to where i was staying at trump international.
The reviews on yelp were great so i made an appointment.
The prices were lower then some and on average with others.
I arrive and they advice me the part is on the way as we speak.
They have fresh cookies water soda ice creme tea and coffee for free while you wait with a 47 in flat screen tv.
Making waiting in the waiting room not such a bad idea.
I would totally recommend them to any one in vegas or going to vegas that needs to get something repaired pretty quick.

The manager and his crew are the best.
I personally hate every mechanic I encounter due to their arrogance and poor performance but Hamid and his crew are the BEST I have encountered.
Not only they fixed my 09 Jetta but paid my deductible for my warranty.
So nothing came out of pocket.
Will bring my friends and family to his honest business in the future.
This review is about six months late and I still have no problems with my car.
I don't say corny stuff but thanks Bussy Buggy.

The owner, Samir, used to own a shop by my house that was awesome!
Now he is here and I am happy to have found him.
Very upfront, reasonable and complementary coffee, tea, soda and snacks.
This guy is a real pro and has the certificates hanging on the wall to prove it.

Hamid was very courteous.
Heather was as well.
They gave recommendations without being pushy.
I look forward to getting my "baby" running right!

This was by far the best experience I have ever had with an auto shop.
My girlfriend and I were traveling across the country from Boston to San Francisco, and Vegas was one of our stops on the trip.
Everyone's biggest nightmare when driving cross country is having mechanical problems, and breaking down.
We started to have acceleration problems and the check engine light was on, so we decided to get it looked at in Vegas.
I called early in the morning, when the shop opened, in order to make an appointment and make sure that I had enough time for the car to be fixed.
When I called I was told that no appointment was needed and that I could just bring the car in... needless to say I was stunned and amazed.
When I brought it in Hamid took my keys, informed me that they had a great selection of coffee, sodas, and cookies that I could enjoy while I waited - I was pretty happy at this point.
After a short time, my car was brought into the garaged and diagnosed.
Not only did Hamid give me a diagnosis for what could potentially be wrong with my car, he also gave me a diagnosis of everything else that was wrong with my car, with great descriptions and prices!!!
I ended up getting a couple of things fixed, one the could have been related to my problem, and the other that was completed unrelated, a cracked coolant reservoir,  which Hamid suggested I should absolutely get fixed due to the fact that we were driving across the country and going through some hot areas.
The entire experience was amazing!
I don't know how other auto shops are around Vegas, but there is no need to go anywhere else, Hamid and his mechanics are amazing and very friendly.

My Infiniti stalled with the engine light and oil leak during our road trip from San Francisco Bay Area to fabulous Las Vegas and I didn't know any good auto repair shops located near the Vegas Strip.
I was able to Yelp and Google this place and found that they have AWESOME services.
The staff were helpful and friendly the moment we arrived.
I got my estimated quote on the diagnostics on what the issues were and they offer complimentary water, soda and coffee on the side.
I am usually skeptically about most auto repair shops, especially to places that I am not familiar with; but this place, hands down, has the BEST customer services I have experienced.
They even offer and gave us a ride to/from the Vegas hotel to pick-up my vehicle when it was completed.
I would highly recommend this place to all my friends and family who happens to need a mechanic during their visit to Vegas.
Merci beaucoup Busy Buggy!

Threatened Heather with a downgrade to four stars because I and another customer ate all the ice cream.
Still the best place to take your car!!!

They are very nice and did a great job :)

After seeing Hamid post abut someone's bad experience, Hamid are you still the owner?
I was told that you sold the shop.
Although I had good service I still was sad to hear that you left because you made my first experience there so wonderful.
They did it again........I LOVE LOVE LOVE BUSY BUGGY.
Seriously if you are having any car troubles, take it here.
Last night I received a ck chg system on my message board in the HHR.
What in the world does that mean?!?!?!
I called and he said it may be a loose wire but probably the alternator is going.
GREAT!
Plz let me make it to the shop in the morning because who wants to be stuck somewhere in 100+ degree weather...surely not me.
I was there about 7:10 (they open at 7:30) and Ezequieo (the NEW OWNER) was opening the shop.
I was willing to wait but he said no come on in.
He took it right back and sure enough, alternator.
Almost $600.00 but because I trust them from the last time they worked on my car, I didn't care.
DO IT!
I asked if anyone could take me home since it would be a few hours and of course he offered.
He was very sweet, nice conversation so I didn't feel like I was in a car with a stranger although I was lol.
Curiosity always gets the best of me so of course I called Pep Boys, $807.00 and Meinike was $625.00.
They've beat prices yet again.
A few hours later, my baby was ready.
Blasted the air, radio and drove full speed to make sure it wouldn't come back on.....of course the waiting area is clean with free refreshments.
THANK YOU AGAIN BUSY BUGGY.
You are AWESOME!!!
See you in a few weeks for my brakes!

Not sure what all these other review's are talking about...
I had a completely different experience during my first and last visit to this shop yesterday.
I walked in to this so called "comfortable" lobby and approached the main desk to inquire about an oil change.
The little guy at the counter said "wait one minute, I'll be with you soon".
So I stepped to the side.
After standing there and waiting for 10-15 minutes, he finally acknowledges me again and we start the process of getting the oil change.
I got the synthetic-blend for $29.95.
I also used the "$10" off for checking in on Yelp!
discount they had.
"It's going to be an hour wait"... so I sit and wait.. now the true colors start to shine.
Just with me waiting there, I'm hearing the counter guy calling a lady about her vehicle, each call adding another $160 to $220 more than what was originally quoted to her.. after three calls in 40 mins this lady was charged an extra $700 on top of the original quoted $70 job!!!
(Stick with me now)  Next, there's a guy in the waiting room with me who was getting a/c work done.
He was taking advantage of their a/c special which (if I remember correctly) was $69.99.
This guy sounded like he was in dire need of an a/c fix.
Next thing I hear is the counter guy telling the car owner that there's a pin hole leak in one of the hoses and to fix this it's going to cost another $100, the customer hesitantly agrees to go with the fix.
10 minutes pass by and the counter guy ask the a/c customer to come back to the desk where he then tells the customer that the previous solution was an ineffective solution and now they think it's the o-rings causing the leak and IF that's the problem it'll cost this guy another $160 to repair.. for O-RINGS?!?!?
$160 DOLLARS?!?!?!
So by this point you can see and hear the customer starting to get worried and again hesitantly agrees to pay the upcharge.
So he walked in looking to pay $70 and will be paying an extra $260 on top of that for a solution that "MIGHT" work.
I start thinking to my self "these a-holes better not try upselling me for anything, I just want an oil change".
So my name is called, my truck is ready, and BOOM... "well we see that your brakes might be a little light and causing a slight squeal which will cost $199.99 for front or back brakes... also we noticed a slight leak in the front struts which will cost $308.99"  Now the fun part--- the oil change was $29.95..
I used the Yelp!
$10 off any service coupon which would put me at $19.95... my bill total was $40 dollars... now I'm left scratching my head, where is this extra $20 coming from?!?!
He proceeds to tell me it from TAXES!!!
Are you fkin kidding me?!?!?!
This place is a scam center and perfect scamming for those people too stupid to realize they are being worked over.
From what I saw there, never feel good about the original quoted price, they will increase that 3-4 times before you are done... on services that "SHOULD or MIGHT WORK"

I had recently visited Busy Buggy and seriously caught them on a bad day.
There were some staff working in new positions and unfortunately it showed and carried on to me, the customer.
I had left my feedback on my first and only visit and I will say, it was not good.
But then something happened that rarely happens when leaving reviews on Yelp!, the owner (who was out of work the day I went) got a hold of me and explained his sincere apology and shared deep disbelief about how my situation unfolded at his property.
He did all he could to try and make the situation correct, even offered to double check my vehicle to ensure the work was done correctly.
Now this is a real owner who shows a true passion for his craft.
This is not too common from shop owners around town.
Honest and actually wants your trust!
Thanx again Hamid

I was just here for an inspection on what my car needed and the experience was wonderful.
All day I have been calling around and looking for a reasonable mechanic.
I was just about to give up when I stumbled on a post on Reddit/r/vegas recommended this place.
I called up and I got a reasonable quote and I quickly brought my car to their shop to get a proper inspection.
Before I went here I had gone to a brake shop (Midas) in Missouri who told us we needed new brake pads.
This was not true.
Hamid told me I still had about 6 months until I had to change pads.
In the brief time I spent there waiting for my car (oil change/ inspection) they fixed a flat tire free for the owner of Tofu Hut, they took a women to a local nail spa, and I met a handful of local regulars who had nothing but praise for the shop and owner.
This is our new car shop, for oil, brakes and all maintenance.
This is as good as it gets.

My boyfriend and I were driving through Las Vegas on our way to California.
As we were leaving Colorado, the air compressor seized up.
We drove 9 hours through the desert with no AC and decided we would get it fixed in Las Vegas.
We called about 15-20 auto repair shops based on travelers' reviews on yelp and google, and Busy Buggy had the best prices by far.
They were also willing to get us in ASAP the next day (we got to vegas a little late).
Hamid did an overall checkup on my car and found two major items other than the compressor that needed to be done in order to ensure safe driving.
He was easy to work with, had fair prices, and the customer service is top notch.
If I ever have any major work that needs to be done, I might just drive from San Diego to have him do it.
Thanks Busy Buggy!
