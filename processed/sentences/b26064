Chiropractic For Life was recommended to me when I was pregnant, and I now gladly recommend their services to anybody I come across who seems to be in need of an alignment (pregnant or no).
I'm surprised to be the first reviewer because there have consistently been several people in the waiting room each time I've been to the office, and I regularly hear Dr. Koury being recommended by other people in my mommy group.
Dr. Koury specializes in chiropractic care for pregnant women and children.
Even though it was veeeery daunting for me to seek out a chiropractor for the first time ever when I was 8 months pregnant, Dr. Koury was nurturing and supportive (and yes the table moves down to accommodate your baby bump!
)  The rationale for chiropractic care when pregnant is that it's supposed to both open up your pelvis for delivery and help your uterus function at maximum potential.
(TMI alert) I was able to deliver a 10.5 lb baby naturally and really feel like the several weeks of care at Chiropractic For Life leading up to the delivery helped my pelvis open up enough to do that.
(Along with acupuncture, but that's another review for another day:)) I know several people who take their babies here but I just personally cannot wrap my head around taking my infant in for an adjustment!
But it's definitely something to consider if you feel that your baby might have some kinks to work out.
lol Dr. Koury is an advocate for natural birth and breastfeeding and opens her office to local support groups twice a month.
I got the impression that she is very accepting and although I knew she believed in the benefits of home birth, I didn't feel judged for my choice to deliver in a hospital.
