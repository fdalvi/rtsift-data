I love this place.
I read about it here on Yelp and decided to give it a try.
So much better than the mechanic I had previously gone to.
Initially I had an electrical problem and they fixed it fast and at a reasonable price.
After that experience I decided to bring it back for them to look at a problem  I had with a rattle in the under carriage of my '99 Camry.
I had been told by the other mechanic that it was a problem with an engine mount and would cost $750 to fix - when I brought it to Precision I mentioned what the other mechanic thought it was, left it there and got a call later that after noon - it had been a bent muffler pipe and the work had been done for free.
Now, I don't think that's going to happen again, but how many mechanics wouldn't at least charge for labor?
In these tough economic times it's so refreshing to run in to that level of honesty.
This is the only place in Las Vegas where I'll take my Toyota.

The guys that run this place are fantastic, and very knowledgeable.
You can always take vehicle in and not worry about paying for unneeded maintenance or parts.
I've been using them to service my Toyota's for over 10 years now.

I've been a loyal customer here at Precision for about 7 years.
I've brought all the toyota / lexus in the family and have been happy every time.
Jeff is awesome as are all the techs that work here.
From Lexus to camrys to trucks to sports cars, they know it all and will work on it with care and diligence.
Super trustworthy.
If you need a ride they will drop you off / pick you up too.
Go see these guys for any Lexus/Toyota repairs needed.

Before Precision Performance, I was a crooked mechanic's favorite customer.
Greedy eyes light up when this tiny, young looking, car-clueless, girl would walk in to a shop.
Something about me screams "Sucker", and I've literally been told that I needed parts replaced that don't even exist on my car.
Enter Precision Performance:  Recommended by a long time customer, I cringed as usual when I showed up with a brake problem, expecting it would cost hundreds to correct.
I left that day having paid $35 in labor with brakes that felt like new.
When it was just dust, they didn't pretend it was anything bigger.
That was a delightfully new experience for me.
Since then, 2 Toyotas later, I hate when I have to take my car elsewhere.
Most recently my transmission looked to be on its way out.
Another mechanic told me hands down, it would need to be replaced, there were no other possibilities.
Precision Performance found a warranty I didn't know I had.
They'd conferred with someone they trusted at a dealership who was expecting my call to replace a computer.
It solved the problem and saved me thousands.
When more expensive work is unavoidable they'll advise me in what I need to do to drive safely now, and what we can wait to revisit on the next service.
Uneducated as I am, following their advice has kept me off the side of the road and with no need for tow trucks for years.
Outside of their work and honesty, I like them as people.
Their staff is friendly and always make time to answer my questions.
It's a no frills shop, don't expect anything fancy, but there is good reason that many of these reviews come from customers who have been loyal to Precision Performance for years.

Mechanics don't come much better Or HONEST than this.
Professional, Fast and fair in their pricing.
I've been taking my Toyota's there for over 10 years.

My check engine light was on in my 2001 Toyota.
I was planning on going to a dealership to get it checked-out/ fixed because I thought the repairs would be more reliable (there's got to be some reason they cost so much, right?
), but I had some doubts based on the sloppy service I had there last time.
I searched around for coupons, called for a price ($160 just for diagnostic), and opened up the online appointment page.
Then I decided to check some reviews.
Based on the reviews here and on the Car Talk Mechanic Files page, I decided to check out Precision Performance.
When I called their number I was greeted by a really nice, easy-to-understand guy who told me I could just bring in my car and they'd check out the error codes for me without an appointment.
The next day I brought my car to them.
There were several people in the waiting room, but the guy behind the desk took my keys and checked the car.
A few minutes later, he called me outside and told me that the codes were all emission control errors (which I already knew because I had brought the car into Autozone for a free readout).
He said that a lot of times those errors are faulty and since I didn't need my smog test for another year, he turned them off and told me to come back if I have any more trouble with it or anything else.
He shook my hand and told me to have a great day.
Man!
It was so easy and was the best automotive customer service I've had...maybe ever.
The engine light has stayed off so far, and I'm so relieved I didn't end up paying a bunch of money for nothing.
I'm definitely going to return to Precision Performance.

This is the only place that you will not be ripped off .
You will get the best service in Las Vegas.

I took my girlfriends Lexus in today.Right off the bat I notice that the here service is phenomenal, hands down, some of the friendliest dudes in the industry.
The pricing was way cheaper than the rest and they didn't hike up the price after the service.
Oh, and the timeliness was ridiculous!
I was told I'd be there anywhere from 30 mins to an hour...20 minutes, BOOM, done!
What Mexicans are to the moving industry, these guys are to the auto-mechanic world, excepts they all speak English.
I'll definitely be back and recommend this place.
Buen trabaj√≥ hombres!

Stopped here with a car problem on a roadtrip from la to ny and Jeff (the owner) spent about an hour on the car and didn't charge me.
He tried a maf and when that wasn't it he pulled it and didn't charge me.
Also gave me a card and told me to call if I'm on the road and something happens.
Great guy!

Had a Toyota Corolla with a water pump failing and took it to Precision for a second opinion and got away better rate.
Super friendly staff.
Jeff, I assume owner, took our car in right when we showed up and came back with a free diagnosis and estimate on the spot.
We plan on taking our Toyota here from now on, even oil changes.
Highly recommend this place!

Excellent service.
After the dealer told me my problem was worn tires, I brought my car here.
The owner, Jeff, diagnosed my 2009 Lexus IS250 over the phone.
The same day I brought it in without an appointment so he could verify which wheel bearing was bad.
Jeff looked at the car right away and gave me an estimate without charging me for troubleshooting.
Later I told Jeff the dealer would cover the repairs because it's still under warranty and he was very nice and told me to have the dealer repair it.
Very honest and trustworthy business.
They have earned my business for any future non-warranty repairs, I wish I knew about them earlier.

I had a great experience with Precision.
We were on a roadtrip and stopping in Vegas for only a couple of days and developed a frightening problem with our brakes before we arrived.
Took our Corolla to Precision (based on their excellent reviews and Toyota specialization) to see what the problem was.
The waiting area is comfortable and welcoming, and they were very friendly.
Most importantly, of course, they found my problem (broken shim), fixed it within an hour, and sent me on my way AT NO CHARGE.
They waved away my trying to pay them, claiming it was such an easy fix, and wished me luck on my trip.
Even without incentives to get my future business (as I don't live in LV), they still acted with great integrity and service, which are rare qualities.
Highly recommend!
