What an awesome dentist!
The staff is very friendly, professional and on top of their game.
I was looking for a dentist for the whole family that was close to home and this was it.
Ratings on other review sites brought me here.
Dr. Davis and Staff are great at what they do.
They have done some work on my wife and I.   I trust them with my whole family!
I like the ambiance of their office and the friendly overtone in general.
My wife is always nervous with the dentist and they were no exception.
They took the extra mile to make sure her experience was a pleasant one.
Great location, clean, warm, friendly, professional.
I am definately referring everyone I know to this dentist.

The BEST Dentist ever!!!

I'm pretty timid when it comes to dental visits.
However, I couldn't talk myself out of going this time because I had pain and was scared it would get worse if I didn't check it out.
His dental assistant was great at making me feel comfortable through the initial procedure.
Dr. Davis was amazing too.
He could probably calm down a rabid dog and get into their mouth, as he had the patience of a saint with me.
He took all the time I needed to go over everything and address all my concerns.
I'm new to the area so it was a calculated shot in the dark picking a dentist.
This time I got a bullseye!
Thank you Dr. Davis and staff for making it a good experience to come in today!

Dr Davis has been our family dentist for years.
He is gentle and detailed.
The staffs are very friendly and professional.
All referral from Dr Davis has been the best in the field.
I would recommend him to anyone.
