Don't go here!
I went it for a bang trim and hair cut and came home with an uneven mess.
My hair is naturally straight with NO layers or anything else.
All I asked for was to have my bangs trimmed and the ends trimmed up to get rid of split ends.
When I came home I was embarrassed at how my hair looked.
It was unbelievable how uneven the bangs were and the ends of the rest of my hair was.
I would not recommend going here.
Also, the stylist I had wasn't very friendly and even criticized me for straightening my hair everyday.

Keith I am the Owner of the Salon and that was NOT me at shell buying Lotto tickets.
We have no men that work there or ever have.
I have no idea why he was in the salon or who he was with.
The Salon has a great staff that takes pride in what they do there.
I have recently purchased this Salon and we are trying hard to build and succeed.
