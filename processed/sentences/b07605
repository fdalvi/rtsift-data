I went here back in the day.
My kids go here now.
They really do have some good teachers.
I appreciate them all.

My children attend this school and they really enjoy it.
The have a ton of extra curricular activities on top of every classroom having a smart board and every 5th and 6th grader having a laptop.
They have muffins with mom and donuts with dad once a semester and my kids absolutely love this event.
My middle son is in the choir, and my oldest was in band for a while.
I would highly recommend this school, the principal Mrs. Koppen was a student here many moons ago and you can tell there is a special connection for her.
One of the best principals I have seen, very fair and involved with her students and teachers.

If you have a special needs child don't count on them getting an education here!
To get an IEP done, it took 4 meetings as they could not do in one sitting.
I am a single mother/grandmother raising my special needs grandson.
Right now if my special needs child acts up, he is sent home and then suspend because the principal does not have time.
The special needs teacher dropped him from her class... education denied.
The school has know about his needs as he has been attending DVUSD since age 3.
They have been shoving him from one grade to the next and pushing him into the mainstream when he is not ready.
The DVUSD superintendent will not return your phone calls.
Now I have to call the state superintendent & governors office so he can get an education.
