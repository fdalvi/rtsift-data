The last time i was here it wasn't as bad as i remembered it to be in the past.
When you come here be prepared to wait and hour or two before you can leave.
Also expect  below average customer service and bring some water and snacks lol you are welcome.

This place is a scam.
If your car is towed here without warning because you mistakenly parked in a wrong spot be prepared to pay $100+ to get your car out.
Plus.
you get to deal with former ex cons, methheads, and employees with no teeth.
Shamrock towing conveniently closes at 5pm so the average working professional can't make it to the tow yard before it closes.
These operating hours are just part of a a scam to get you to pay for an additional day of storage.
On top of it they don't even allow you access to your vehicle if you need to get your garage door opener or any personal belonging you might have left in your vehicle, despite the fact that you're holding your car keys.
You need to bring proof that you're the registered owner such as your title, which means you have to find a way home first before you can even retrieve your vehicle.

Do not use this company to tow your car.
My husband called to have our car towed and told them he would present our AAA card to them for payment.
They towed the car to the dealership and then informed us that the bill would be $147.00.
When my husband reminded them that we were using triple A they then informed him that they don't accept AAA.
Funny how they didn't let him know that when he made the appointment.
Scammers!
