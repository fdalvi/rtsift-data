Love the greek american blend.
Perfect for all tastes!

the food is amazing, I've tried almost all the foods there.
Every visit there, I'm never disappointed.
The owners and workers there are the nicest people I know.
This is definitely on my favorite places to eat list.

where do I start with this place ?
OK they made our drinks and then didn't give them to us just let them sit on the counter while it took 25 min for our order.
Oh and the girl put coffee cup lids on our drinks.
They skimp on things where they can .
A quarter of a pickle just thrown in your food?
Not even a full pickle spear?.
Do not get the tazekie sauce it's way watered down!
!I  The French fries were good after ya heated them up in the microwave.
They said they have a Italian sausage sandwich but it's not a sandwich they give you its just a polish sausage on a hot dog bun.
The cheeseburger they offer is a frozen patty Qt burger with skimpy dressings on it.
