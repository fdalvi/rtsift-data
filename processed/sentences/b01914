Normally I don't review Subway's but this time I felt I must.
We came here late with a craving for subs.
Everything was going okay, me waiting in car until fiance comes out and says please tell me you brought your purse and I said no, we ran out of the house and I brought nothing!
Well apparently he forgot his wallet and went back in to tell them that we would have to return.
They said it was okay and gave it to us anyway.
Now I don't suggest that anyone try anything to get anything for free but it was a very nice gesture.
When we came back to the store to pay, they said that's okay!
Awesome people work here!

I mostly go to this Subway in Ahwatukee due to the location and proximity to my home.
The staff whom I generally see the same members of, have always been friendly and the service is usually pretty good except when you get those annoying customers who act like they've never eaten a sub before.
Overall, not too shabby.

Quick service with friendly people.
Clean establishment too.
As always great subs and salads.
My currant favorite here is their breakfast sandwiches!
They rock!
Especially after a great workout!
Love it!
