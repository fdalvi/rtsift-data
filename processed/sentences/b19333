I used to go to this spot all the time when it was a taco/mexican food place.
It recently got bought out and converted to  "Italian & Mexican Cuisine.
"  The family that owns it is nice, gives a discount to repeat customers, and the food itself is decent.
I must say though the menu is really lacking and looks like 8 people each picked an item to put on the menu.
They serve your basic tacos, gyros, and pasta.... but really don't specialize in anything.
Probably not a place I'll visit again soon, but it's brand new so maybe they'll get the kinks worked out soon.

The gyros here are the best.
The meat is sliced off the vertical spit  when the order is placed, so it's fresh, not too dry or too greasy.
Definitely surprised by the quality of this strip-mall joint.

This place is weird.
They are an "Italian/Mexican" restaurant.
Maybe its me, but I don't need my tacos from the same guy that makes my spaghetti.
I had the gyro sandwich.
The gyro meat was average and the tzatziki sauce was bland.
I also thought $7 for the sandwich was too much too.
Haji baba's in Tempe is still the best gyro around.
