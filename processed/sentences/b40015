To preface this review I worked as a professional paint team for 2 years in my pre-college days.
As a result I am very skeptical of painters because I know all the tricks they can use to cut corners.
Recently purchased a new home in Maricopa and called Anthony at Fresh Look Painting.
He came out on time and walked the home with me going over my vision.
After we were done he provided an estimate that was very competitive.
During the process Anthony was very available, communicating via email about questions I had and making minor changes we discussed.
After all was said and done he was finished on time and the house looks better than I had imagined.
I would highly recommend Fresh Look Painting to anyone in the Maricopa area.

High quality at an affordable price!
Anthony & his team did a great job on our outside "pop outs" and also various inside rooms over the years.

My son recommended Fresh Look Painting after having the interior of his house painted.
I was very impressed with the results and I was in need of having the exterior painted on my home.
I called Anthony for an estimate and he showed up on time that day and each day that he was working on my house.
His men did an awesome job and they finished in two days (2 story home).
I would highly recommend Fresh Look Painting and intend on calling Anthony again when the interior of my home needs painting.
Thanks Anthony!
