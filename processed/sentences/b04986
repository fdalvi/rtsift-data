How long has it been since you tried to get gas somewhere that doesn't have the option to pay at the pump?
Not only are they living in the stone age with gas station technology- the line was long, and no wonder.
We wanted to fill the tank of our rental car.
We had to guess at the amount.
If we guessed too much it meant another wait in line.
Too little means we left with a tank not full.
Since you can't take a rental car back like that, we ended up stopping at another gas station to finish the job.
What a waste of time.
The clerk was pleasant- but she must get constantly hounded by those who aren't frequent customers.
One has to wonder why Chevron allows their name to be muddied by an outlet too cheap to upgrade their technology.

I agree with the previous posters.
I stopped here when I was in the neighborhood to get gas and there is no pay at the pump.
I had to go inside, tell the woman how much I wanted pumped, show her my ID for the credit card, swipe and then pay.
I will drive by this place in the future.
The set up is just plain dumb and this station aptly earns its name.
