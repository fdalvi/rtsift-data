I was at a wedding here and it was very nice.

The complimentary airport shuttle service that I booked more than 24 hours in advance per their request was never sent to pick me up.
Our room was never cleaned - even though we were gone 8am until midnight.
One of the staff members verbally abused my friend throughout the night.
A long, odd and uncomfortable story.
The manager never bothered to return the message I left her highlighting these issues.
Yikes!

Pool was dirty and disgusting.
Too bad since the rest seemed nice
