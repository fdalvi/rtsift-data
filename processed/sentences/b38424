This store has just about everything from paper goods, glass ware to tools and a lot in between.
There is not a lot of places where you can still buy flypaper.
Despite the name, not every item is 99 cents.
Everything is pretty cheap though.
Every time I go in there I just walk around the store just to look at all the different things they sell.

This was a teriffic little store, but sadly, it has closed.

This store is closed
