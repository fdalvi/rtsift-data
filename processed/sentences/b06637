I brought a pair of jeans for a hem job.
I forgot the exact amount, but it was like $18 without original hem and ~$21 with the original.
I choose to alter it with the original hem, and I like the result very much.
It's in sort of obscure place, so it might be hard to find, but it's close to campus and reasonable price, so I'm not complaining.

I had two pairs of pants altered there -- one hem and the other, a hem and waist intake -- in November.
She (or they?
) does an excellent job.
Alterations are never cheap, and I found her prices reasonable.
(I brought my pants to her while visiting from New York, where alterations can be VERY costly.
) I admired her work on a beautiful velvet men's jacket that a customer came in to try on and retrieve.

I came here to get a dress hemmed and was very pleased with the results.
The seamstress did a great job of helping me decide what length to make the dress and was very friendly.
On top of that, the dress was ready in 2 days and only cost $15!
I will definitely be going back for all my tailoring needs.

I brought a leather coat in last week to have the sleeves shortened.
The work was done quite well and very quickly.
Less than a week turnaround.
The price was definitely reasonable, I was expecting to be asked for a whole lot more.
I'll go back the next time I need something altered.

Alterations are not cheap, and as a petite person who always needs petite denim jeans hemmed, I wish that the K-12 system had not denied me the chance to learn sewing so I could DIY, or that I was actually in conformity with the Western conception of a 5 foot 4 inch petite female, but why dwell on what you can't change now ...
I have had two pairs of pants altered here before, the main lady who works there did a nice job and they were on time.
I believe I did price comparisons and at the time, which was two years ago, it was the most competitively priced.

I've tried several people in town and this is by far the best place.
I'm just barely 5ft tall so I pretty much need very pair of pants hemmed.
She has also done a great job with bridesmaid dresses and with the pants and jacket for my nicest suit.
Very reasonably  price and she can be flexible on time.
She's rushed a job for me more than once w/o an extra fee (compared to the $30 up charge from another place in town).
Only down side is the hours but it's worth that inconvenience.
Also - If  you're trying to drive to the store, there's an entrance on Gilman Street so just park there rather than trying to get in on the University side.

felt prices too high and sales people could use an attiude adjustment

Awesome!
The little hook to hold the strap on my bra ripped and I needed it fixed and wasn't even sure if anyone could do it for me.
I took it here and she fixed it in about two minutes!!!
Super friendly.

FAST!
CHEAP!
GREAT WORK!
They only accept cash and parking stinks, but it's FAST... CHEAP & they do GREAT WORK!
I brought some curtain in on Thursday to be hemmed and they were ready Friday for a cool $30.
Sounds like a lot?
They were velvet, 115 inches long and 64 inches wide...
I was ok paying more than I would for a pant because these things given their size were like a bajillion pants.
