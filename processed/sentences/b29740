This place just opened and it appears that they are still working out the kinks.
the yogurt is 42 cents an ounce which appears to be a little pricey for the quality of the yogurt.
they also offer soft serve ice cream, but the machine was not working and I would have had to wait another 20 minutes if I wanted it.
On a whole, this place is no different than golden spoon or any of the other yogurt places, however it is more expensive.

We usually go to Golden Spoon or Sweet Republic but decided to try the new yogurt shop in the area.
Yogurt was fine - tastes the same as many of the other yogurt shops where its self serve and you add the toppings and there was a wide variety of flavors (not a huge selection but very different flavors).
However, many of the toppings were stale and hard - my son picked our marshmallows, holiday marshmallows and candy corn and they were all so hard he didn't want to eat them.

Owner is super friendly.
We go often!
He even changes the movie for us so my preschoolers can watch their favorites.
I highly recommend mix n lix.
Yogurt flavors are awesome.
Excellent variety of toppings.
Low price, not expensive like most other places.
This is as good as it gets!

The owner is very friendly and the yogurt was refreshing on a 108 degree day!

I give Mix n Lix five stars for the flavor and consistency of the yogurt.
The owner swirled samples for me as he explained that they don't use any powders to create their flavors.
Five stars for his zeal and passion for the product.
The yogurt itself is thick, creamy and incredibly tasty.
Tart is a little too tart for my palette; it's made with Greek yogurt.
I can't get enough of the chocolate and vanilla!!!
Cake batter is spot-on as well.
Three stars for the space itself.
The toppings are divided, with one bar adjacent to the beginning of the line and another at the end...this setup is something new, maybe not the most convenient.
I like the gigantic spoons for to dole out the toppings.
It was much easier to load up on the goodies without sugary morsels flying everywhere.
Four stars for ingenuity of toppings--chocolate-covered doughnut holes?!
Yes, please!

My standards for frozen yogurt is high.
Right around the corner is Golden Spoon, and a hop/skip/jump away is Yogurtology.
For the best frozen treat ever, you can walk across the street to Sweet Republic.
When you compare, Mix n Lix looks kind of sad and pathetic.
I popped in after a sandwich session at Quizno's, and I was disappointed.
The woman working at the counter didn't really know much about the product, but to her credit, she was friendly, and didn't cop an attitude.
The store itself is small, and I was let down by the lack of flavor options.
The topping bar is a bit bizarre.
It's split up on two sides of the store.
It just made everything...uncomfortable.
Lastly, I was a little creeped out by the Disney Channel videos on the TV.
There were no kids in here, nor were there any kids working here.
You are better off going elsewhere.
Go to Golden Spoon.
Who cares if you can't swirl it yourself?
At least the product and store is better.

Very welcoming owner and the kids loved it!
Lots of toppings to choose from, he even put on cartoons for them so they could kick back and have a nice little 'kids break".
Gave me a break, too :)

I had a groupon for this place that was about to expire so we decided to check this out on Tuesday night.
The place is really small compared to other yogurt places we've visited and they only had about 7-8 flavor choices.
Their toppings bar wasn't much better in terms of selection.
Like Dave said, if you're in the area, you're better off visiting Yogurtology or Sweet Republic.

Love the yogurt and the friendly service!
My fave is original tart swirled with pistachio or the new pomegranite sorbet.

************Attitude and Toppings at 44 cents Ounce**********  The middle age Guy (owner ??
), becomes a OGRE ........ when he sees a Groupon.
I got the feeling that this shop ......... like many of its kind .......... aren't making it.
*******My decision to purchase YOUR Groupon ......... was a good one********* *******************Now I know ......... that I'll never be back*********************    ***********I don't care if ATTITUDE is reduced to 32 cents an ounce***********  Its just a matter of time ........... that this place packs up its toppings ..... and closes.

Not so great.
weird.

Mix and Lix is a little unique I'll give you that but the owner is really nice and I find some of the reviews a bit racist.
The yogurt is way tastier than the chains and they have some crazy flavors you won't see anywhere else.
It's not a chain and I feel bad for this place.
They make smoothies and have other options besides self serve.
I agree the layout is strange but they do have a ton of toppings.
I hope it survives.

Solid Yogurt.
But what makes this little place standout are the owners.
My son and I go after every football practice and are always welcomed with a smile and a nice comment.

This week, my daughter and I stayed close to home and went to Mix n Lix.
This is a quaint little frozen yogurt tucked away in a corner shopping center just off of Shea Blvd and 92nd.
When we arrived, there were no other patrons in the shop, so we were afforded the opportunity to see the entire shop for what it really was...super small.
To give you an idea of how little usable space there is inside, you can only use one of the doors to get in.
The door on the left remains locked in order to make room for a contemporary floor lamp.
Don't get me wrong...they really have tried to make the most out of the space.
There is wrap-around seating along the front and side windows, as well as a nice little table for three placed up against the far wall.
They also have two tables outside on the patio, which, in the event that this place is busy, could offer you some respite.
The yogurt itself was still pretty decent.
Being the only two patrons in the room, we received the shop owner's full attention as we made our way towards the dispensers.
He could tell that we'd never been to his establishment, and he was fully engaged  to make sure that we got exactly what we wanted.
There were only 10 flavors from which to choose, so that made our decision a relatively easy one.
We opted for the Thin Mint Oreo Chocolate...an excellent choice if I do say so myself.
We made our way over to the toppings.
There was a decent selection from which to choose, though not as robust as some of the places we've been to date...I'd say it was, at the very least, adequate.
We ended up adding 2 gummy worms, a scoop of cookie dough, a small scoop of mini Reece's Pieces, and a scoop of sprinkles.
When all was said and done, we spent $5.00 for the half-full cup and all of those toppings.
To top it all off, the owner was kind enough to give my daughter three frosted animal crackers (one for each member of our family) out of the kindness of his heart.
His kindness didn't go unnoticed...but, his establishment is just so small.
What to do?
I hate being conflicted...

I was very impressed with this sugar hole.
More of a boutique frozen yogurt shop.
Less of a selection, however, each yogurt I sampled had its flavor PERFECTED.
The selection of toppings were excellent, they offered many things I hadn't seen elsewhere.
I topped my pomegranate sorbet with chocolate dipped sunflower seeds coated in a candy-coated shell, strawberries, blackberries, and a dark chocolate coated candy.
It was FABULOUS.. A perfect treat after my dentist appointment next door, I'll be going back for sure.
Service was also excellent, and 5stars for cleanliness as well.
Nice job Mix N' Lix!

These self-serve yogurt shops are a dime a dozen these days, and most offer a very comparable product.
The thing that sets a business like this apart is the service.
I have been to this shop maybe four times and have never been treated with anything other than kindness.
The same man (owner) is always there and he is friendly and helpful.
He recently gave me multiple stamps on my loyalty card for absolutely no reason, which was unnecessary, but showed how much he cares about his customers.
The yogurt has always been good and unlike most of these yogurt shops, the chocolate is actually tasty.
It is a small shop, but this only adds to the charm.

Small, mom and pop operation but the owners are super nice and I like to patronize the non-corporate business owners.
Nice selection of flavors, my favorite is salted caramel with a little bit of fudge and caramel syrup.
They have silvered almonds but chopped almonds would be more favorable.
Try the amazing smoothies!
Very flavorful and you have choices of what you want in them.
Joseph is always so helpful!

This business establishment is CLOSED!
Too bad, the owner was always nice & pleasant.
He chatted with most of his customers.
Mix n Lix had one of the best sea salt & caramel frozen yogurt .
I loved coming here for that and patronizing the small business owner places.
Good luck to Joseph, the owner of this place!
