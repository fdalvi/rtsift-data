Great hot wings and burgers with fries.
Orders may be slow somtimes but its worth the wait.
Great Juke-Box, Kareoke Night on Fridays and Saturdays, you can play pool and play darts in the back.
the atmosphere is very fun and lively I had a great time when I was visiting and I will surelly be back when I have the chance.

Met up with a friend here to have some drinks.
The crowd was very sketchy.
Lots of bikers and hoodlums.
Was a hold on tight to your wallet tight type of place.
Although I hear they have very good wings.
Might have to hire a body guard and go check them out.

The only reason they get 1 star is because the wings.
This is the most nasty, disgusting and rude place you can sit down n eat.
The ppl who horse bet has no respect for other customers.
The Russian waitress is a true b****.
She rubs me as a racist.
The old bar tender finger nails are filthy.
He rubs me as a meth head.
The old white lady is for sure a meth addict.
PPL SAY NO TO DRUGS N PURPLE TURTLE
