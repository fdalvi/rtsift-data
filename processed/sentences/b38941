This was my first time at Massage Envy.
It was wonderful!
I called the day before and was able to book an appt no problem.
I was helped immediately when I arrived, got my paperwork filled out, and got to sit in the tranquility room while I waited for my appt to start.
Racheal did an excellent job!
I had so many knots and she worked hard to get them out and to make me feel better.
I was comfortable the entire 90 minutes.
The environment is relaxing.
I would definitely recommend her.
Checkout was a breeze with Racheal giving me suggestions on what I can do at home to help and how often I should return.
I felt no pressure to sign up for their membership club.
They explained it quickly and understood that I could not afford it at this time.

I always look forward to my monthly appointments with Alyssa.
By far she is one of the top massage therapists I've been to In a while.
She knows what she's doing and I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a great massage!
