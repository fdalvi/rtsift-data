Came in here on a Saturday night (1/21/12).
Customer service was great!
My husband and I were in there for over a half hour and even though the traffic was slow that night the 2 salesperson on duty that night were very personable!!!
They didn't appear fake nor were they hustling!
LOL  I made only 2 small purchases but would gladly come back here again!
(very different from the Sanrio store we had just left where the super fem & bitchy staff were gossiping about other staff & making their Saturday night plans).

I love Fossil for their watches.
I love Fossil for their bags.
I love Fossil for their wallets.
I have even started to love Fossil for items I didn't know they made.
For a long time, I had no idea that they made clothes.
A few times into their actual store and I find that I like their denim and chambray shirts.
When they do discounts, the price is not bad.
Scavenging through the clearance is a must because there tends to be some hidden gems within the organized racks.
Back to their accessories.
The quality of their product is impeccable.
I have moved pass their watches, but the design of their bags and wallets are my new obsession.
I am normally not hung up on leather goods, but the soft and distressed leather items are gorgeous.
I just wait for their 40% off sales because they are not cheap.
The staff are always personable and readily available.
There are so many of them and a quick lap has you running into four or five friendly faces.

nice store.
:) they make michael korrs watches too
