Super Saver Superstition Springs -- try saying that five times -- is one of the last surviving "dollar movie" houses on the East side.
When this first opened, my kids thought it was Disneyland or something.
Racing bright lights, neon, video games, plus movies!
It was admittedly the funnest theater out of more sedate choices.
Today the theater has seen better days, and the audience is more likely snowbirds (daytime) and teenie-boppers (night) than families.
But if you want to save a little cash, it's still a good alternative.

3.5 stars.
The chairs are totally horrible with no head/neck support if you are over 4 feet tall, but the movies are two dollars.
The atmosphere is totally laughable.
There are plastic icicles hanging from the ceiling, and when you turn into the theaters, the ceiling there  is a chrome with blue lights.
Its sort of like 80's futuristic tack threw up on the place, but I love that it went all out with that theme and really stuck to it!

Two dollar movies.
On the big screen.
Two dollars.
That's four dollars if you bring a date.
Bring some whiskey in a flask and that's still:  $2 + $2 + your flask = $4!!
SURE the seats are uncomfortable and most of the flicks are geared towards kids, but...  *  There's usually 2-3 movies for adults *  If you drink enough whisky you'll forget about that gnarly kink in your neck  Did I mention already that it was two dollars?

They've closed!
Sad.

They have not closed as seth F said?
Hes incorrect.
I was there three days ago.
3 dollar movie for me.
Popcorn and concessions are overpriced.
All the movies are old ones that are almost out on DVD, but for 3 bucks who can complain.
Also they carry mostly kid movies, rarely have rated R and limited showings of R rated movies.
