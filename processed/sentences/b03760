I haven't been to Chili's in a few years, but after a hard week a friend asked to go there for margaritas and lunch and so I agreed to it.
In the past I haven't been much of a fan of the place, the food tasted like they were cutting corners in some places and their steak was not good, I'd rather toss one on the grill at home.
Upon arrival it looked exactly as I had remembered, the standard Chili's look.
They had a new menu, including some smaller portion lunch fare.
I had a bacon cheeseburger, the menu had very few exciting items on it, it was mostly stuff you would see at other similar type restaurants.
The food was average, not disappointing and along with the great company it was a comfortable place to hang out.

My wife and I went to this Chilis for the first time a couple of days ago after a late day at work.
We sat in the bar area and easily found a table.
I was impressed with the menu selections - everything looked good.
The food, however, was not as good as it looked.
It seemed as though it was a little low quality.
Not that I expected it to be a five star restaurant, but I was hoping for a little better.
My wife had a chicken salad and had no complaints about it but no raves either.
The service was also a little slow, especially for the bar area were service is usually quicker.
This was especially a problem when we need drink refills after eating jalapeno onion straws!
The person in the next booth was raving about how great the service was (he had a different server) so maybe we just had bad luck.
Overall it was ok and I might go back and give it a second try.
We will see.

Normally, I wouldn't take the time to review a place like Chili's.
We all know by now how unoriginal and uninspiring their menu is, and that Chili's is the Denny's of late night grub.
Well, having said this, the reason that I'm reviewing Chili's today is to tell you about an interesting thing that happened to my bf and I when we visited this Chili's not too long ago.
First, shame on us for resorting to eating here, but it was a cold winter night and we didn't want to venture too far from home.
There food is so forgettable that I honestly can't even remember what we had, I just remember that it wasn't that great.
I think we had some sort of sliders and maybe some taco's that we took a few bites of and quickly got sick of.
The real reason that I am writing however, is to tell about a lame thing that happened to us when we visited (even lamer than the food).
My boy and I were cuddling in a booth, his arm was around my shoulder and my hand was on his thigh.
We were talking to each other and laughing to ourselves quietly, nothing out of the ordinary if you ask me.
We had ordered a dessert and were eating that when all of a sudden the manager of the joint comes up to our booth and says, "How's the dessert, let's keep it a family restaurant".
Before we could even respond, he was gone and we just turned to each other with a bewildered look for the next 5 minutes.
We couldn't figure out what we had done, and the more we thought about it the madder we got.
It's not like we were having sex on the table or touching each other inappropriately in the restaurant.
We were simply sitting close to each other cuddling and eating our dessert.
We were so mad that we blew out of that joint and left our unfinished dessert on the table.
We have never been back and we probably never will since we do not want to eat in a place that reprimands you for cuddling and having a good time.
If a family restaurant is anything like Chili's, then I never want to eat in a family restaurant again!
Keep it a family restaurant my ass, there's probably more drug deals that go on there than anywhere in Scottsdale!

Success starts top down, and the management is always attentive to our needs at Chili's.
They and the staff often know when something's not perfect even if we do not, and they go out of their way to over deliver on Chili's promise of excellence.
It's quick if we need it to be, the food is always delicious and the service is always spot on.
Their regular Margaritas are so good, we rarely even get to try their specialty Margaritas.
My wife and I love Chili's.
It was good enough for our pre-wedding meal when we married at Bellagio and it will always be our first choice.
We will be eating there even when we don't have teeth.

Living in Scottsdale there are endless choices of where to get food from.
Chili's has a nice menu and reasonable prices.
I always order online togo food.
They are good about the time estimates and they usually do a good job of quality control to make sure you get what you order.
Last time I ordered I was missing 1/2 of the bun on a bacon cheese burger.
It was a major/stuck to the paper mess.
Over all Chilis is an ok deal and very convenient if you like to order online and not have to get out of your car to pick up food.

I've been going to this Chili's for years - the staff is always very friendly and the food is consistently good.
My fav is the guiltless chicken sandwich.
I love wine, and recently they re-vamped their list which I'm really happy about.
Try the ONEHOPE Sauvignon Blanc - it was great!

Besides the odd smell that I encountered when I first walked in, this Chili's was pretty rad.
We got seated right away and our waitress got our drink order and drinks out to us in record time.
My mom and I did one of those 2 for $20 deals starting out with there ever addicting chips and salsa...its so hard to just eat only one chip!
Grrr!
I ordered the new grilled veggie tacos that came in a flour tortilla.
I was surprised to see the amount of avocado used, bravo Chili's, way not to be skimpy!
The three tacos were accompanied by white rice and black beans.
My madre got the Margarita chicken tacos that were good, but really dry.
I'd recommend getting sauce or salad dressing on the side.
We never had to ask for a refill on our tea and the manager came around just to see how everything was.
Of course I was in mid-bite, but I managed to nod my head and lose on one mushroom in the process.
I love the amount of options on their menu and have never had a bad experience here.

Wow...and I don't mean that in a good way!
It's hard for me to write a review about a business like this as my experiences are typically not this bad, but here we go: My first review that is really bad.
I visited this Chili's today because I had a couple of gift cards received from the holidays and lunch was still marinating at home.
I previously heard that they had a menu of 550 calorie meals.
I'm not really a calorie counter, but I'm definitely health conscious and I looked at what the offerings were from the website and was impressed by their 550 calorie meals.
They seemed really appetizing and filling and for the most part used unprocessed, unrefined ingredients.
Well, I arrived for lunch as aforementioned and there was no greeter.
Okay...that's fine.
I just waited a little.
It gave me time to view the interior to get a feel for it before I go any further.
I didn't like the environment.
It was really dark; a lot of that of course had to do with the cloudy weather we had today.
This was lunch time though and I wasn't looking for any mood lighting.
The next thing I didn't like was that it felt like a bar.
Now I know this wasn't a fancy restaurant, but I didn't come here to be at a bar!
So minutes passed and I was getting incredibly impatient because there was still no greeter to offer me a seat.
Was I free to sit anywhere I want?
Defintely, NO!
I was about to leave, but my companion didn't want to go and walked a little further into the restaurant to look for a server.
I was facing the door at this point and someone near the bar area asked if someone was helping us.
Of course, NO!
We were seated.
I agreed with the first seat we were offered, but after sitting there for a few seconds I realized it was just too dark.
I asked if it was okay to sit by the window and was allowed to sit elsewhere.
Alas, I sat down again and looked through the menu.
Where is the 550 calorie meals?
I don't see it on the menu or anywhere on display at the table.
I looked through the menu to see if there was anything at all that I could replace that whole idea with and the answer was NO!
I wonder if the 550 calorie meals were only offered for dinner.
I don't know.
I didn't bother to ask either so I just walked out.
I assume this Chili's isn't always a bad deal and bad expierience, but I have to rate this visit according to my experience.
ONE STAR!!!
Hey, Chili's at Shea, it hurts me as much as it hurts you.

*************Has This Happened To You ????
**********     **************There Were Plenty Of Vacant Tables Available*********   My wife and I WAITED a good solid 5 minutes at the hostess station ....... it was UNATTENDED for the entire 5 minutes.
In addition another group was waiting behind us, for almost the same time period.
I asked a server who was passing by ...... wheres the hostess ...... he managed to find her.
At this point, we and the other group had been waiting for approximately 7-8 minutes.
The Hostess, based on her age appeared to be the Manager on Duty ......... informs BOTH PARTIES .... there will be a 5-10 minute wait.
NOT ACCEPTABLE, were the words expressed to hostess/manager by myself and the other party ...... she REFUSED to seat both groups, even though we had now been there a solid TEN MINUTES.
I and the other party, left WITHOUT DINING at Chili's......
I dined instead at Mimi's, and didn't have to put up with any attitude.
The Manager/Hostess was a Redheaded lady, probably in her early thirties.
This experience has left a BAD TASTE, in regards to Chili's and Brinker's.
Has a statement of my disgust, My family will be boycotting all Brinker's owned business.

The service was about as bad as it gets.
The food wasn't very good either.
I thought that the remodel looked great but the service killed any chance they had for our return.

Just terrible, I ordered fajitas expecting chicken cooked over a grill, nope I got pan fried, flavorless garbage.
The waitress was a ditz that couldn't be bothered and she forgot to comp the free chips and salsa.
Oh and it was ridiculously loud we had to sit next to these old ladies playing majong and it sounded like a combine was driving over my head every time they scrambled the pieces.
I officially hate this chilis the only good thing about the meal was the chicken enchilada soup which must come out of a bag otherwise I can't see how it doesn't suck like everything else.
Bad food, bad service, way to loud, why is there no negative star rating?
This place gets negative two stars.
If the sign on the door didn't say chilis I would have thought I was sitting in a dumpster behind the circle k that serves food next to a jet engine testing facility.
Thanks Chilis for making burger king look like fine dining.

Food is OK-Place is OK!
I wouldnt say this is a place I frequent a lot, but its good for quick carryout.
Food is OK.
They have a 2 people for $20 menu, which is convenient.
You get two entrees and an appetizer.
I was tired and didnt want to cook last night and we decided to get Chilis carryout.
I normally get the Chicken Salad, which is light and tastes pretty good, but last night I got the Chx Quesidillas as well as my husband, which was a big mistake.
They were dry and the first half of the quesidilla was empty then the bottom half had cheese and a piece of chicken.
This place has went down hill big time.
Food seems bland and they just throw it together really quick.
I used to go to this location more with co-workers for lunch.
I am staying away for while.
Very disappointed.
The chips and salsa were good (our app).
I would really rate it about 2.5 stars, but there isn't that option.
Reason a 2.5 (or 3 for Yelp) instead of 2 is, because the staff is always super friendly, they have good chips and salsa and its super quick to order.
If you want to eat in, there is NEVER a line or wait, no matter the time or date!
If you check it out, don't get fancy and order something different.
Stick to the easy stuff, soups and salads.
They are pretty decent.
Love the Broccoli Cheese.

Taking a chill out on Chili's.
My friend and I frequent this location usually once a month, occasionally more, & always sit in the bar area.
Our favorite is the Presidente Margarita.
YUM!!!
This has become the staple of our visit and often times, the reason we choose Chili's.
We were very excited to hear the margaritas were being featured on a dinner for two deal - perfect!
Except that choices, well, kinda suck.
The steak wasnt good, and since we dont get the combo.
Upon our most recent visit, we both noticed that we were definitely shorted on our margaritas.
Asked the server/bartender Jake, whom we've had before several times, if the recipe has changed and he swore it hadn't and said that it must have been that every single time before it was made incorrectly.
He told us how he makes it and we reminded him that he's made our drinks for us on multiple occasions.
The thing about Jake is that he is so super cheesy, he wouldn't admit it anyways.
He should work with kids and families, not bar folk.
We both felt insulted and disappointed that the margs we have to come to love so much can no longer fill our glasses two times.
Not sure we'll be coming back.
Def gonna take some time out to chill.

This Chili's has changed over the years and is one of the last surviving original restaurants in this strip mall.
There has been a Micro Brew chain, a Chinese place, a nice Italian restaurant, a BBQ place.
They've all closed over the past three years or so.
Originally, this was a less congested area with easier access, as compared to the other side of the 101/Shea exit.
It still is, if you can avoid the Culver's parking lot.
LOL  When we first started coming here, it was geared to the HH crowd, until the micro brewery stole their thunder.
That  didn't last long.
The Chinese and Italian places really didn't compete for the same diners.
By that time Brinker International, Chili's corporate parent started rolling out their 2 for $20 meal deals.
In many ways, I believe it saved this restaurant.
The food has always been good, though predictable.
Gone is the high fat, Bloomin' Onion.
Replaced by something called Crispy Onion String & Jalapeño Stack.
Clearly a lower caloric (LOL) and tastier offering for only $3.79.
One of the big hits on their appetizer menu is still the Triple Dipper for $10.79.
You can choose from potato skins, boneless buffalo wings, southwestern eggrolls, still more chicken items, and a hot spinach & artichoke dip.
All very good!
On the lunch/dinner menu there is a plethora of healthier choices like salads, alongside their traditional burgers.
They started adding the calorie count about four years ago, long before some states started require it.
Newer to the menu are the sandwiches -- with names like: Philly Cheesesteak, Buffalo Chicken Ranch, Classic Turkey Toasted, California Club Toasted, and Santa Fe Chicken Wrap.
All of which are very good, priced in the $8.50 range, making Chili's sound more like a Quiznos then the old Chili's.
Another plus to this corporate make-over are the soups, which are also very good.
Admittedly, we do not come here as often as we did when the kids were younger.
But it's still a nice place to enjoy a interesting and well prepared meal while looking at all the photos on the wall and enjoying a conversation.
Thankfully, they've never felt the need to changed their Strawberry Lemon aid!
So this Chili's is A-OK in our book.

I recently went there for lunch.
I was seated promptly, then forgotten about for a solid five minutes while other around me where taken care of by their servers.
They were seated after me.
When my server arrived I informed her that I felt forgotten.
Instead of apologizing, she blamed a large group as the cause of my delay.
Wrong.
It shows a systematic problem with their service training.
I will not be going back to this Chilis.

What ever happened to the greeting at the door?
The greeter seemed that she wanted to be some place else.
No smile just wanted to know if we wanted a table or booth.
I remember when they used to open the doors when you arrived and when you left.
Our server was working in tandem with another server and they did a great job of keeping us informed of our meal and made sure we had everything we needed for a nice dinner.

What happened to this place?
Service was bad this time, wings were choking-ly dry!
2 months before yesterday the burger was gross but service was good.
They used to have better food!

Yikes, talk about angry reviews.
I've usually had a great experience at this location.
The greeters are always friendly and seemingly want to be there.
The service is relatively fast and the food is zesty and delicious.
We usually order the 2-for-20 and enjoy guacamole dip and salsa before our entrees.
It's a great deal.
The servers are always friendly and there's never a wait.
Really no complaints on my end!

Fred's Playland gives them two thumbs up.
Great overall experience.
Especially considering we brought them a bus load.
That can be extremely challenging.
Michelle was more than accommodating.
She was without a doubt the best host/manager we've ever had the pleasure of working with.
She made us feel warm and welcome from the very first phone call.
On top of that the food was fantastic and service was great.
I'd recommend the Fahitas and the Lava Cake.
Everyone was pleased.
Fred's Playland thanks Michelle and Chili's.

Margarita Chicken Salad and the Beef Enchiladas are great!!
Alex our waiter was very good and attentive, thanks a lot.

This is for a to-go order.
I hope for Chili's sake that the dine-in experience is better, but after this experience, I don't think I'm willing to find out.
I ordered a grilled chicken on black beans, rice and pico de gallo with crispy tortilla strips from the "lighter choices" menu.
Here's what I actually received for $10.79:  A cold, dried out piece of chicken breast atop crispy tortilla strips.
No beans.
No rice.
No pico de gallo.
What the hell?
We also ordered the California Grilled Chicken Flatbread appetizer.
This was cold and chewy versus hot (I even would've been happy with warm) and crispy.
All of the food was cold, and we only live five minutes away.
If you should decide to risk placing and paying for a to-go order at Chili's, make sure you open all the containers before you leave.

It's a Chili's... A chain restaurant that serves comfort Mexican-American food.
Chips and salsa are always good.
However the other food is hit or miss.
As with most appetizers in this kind of restaurant...
There Fryden heavy.
Everything feels a bit fattening  They definitely need some healthier options

Always good food, good lunch menu, reasonable prices, sitting in the bar is perfect, tv, drinks fast service.
And the bartender makes a great bloody Mary it's the perfect cure for a hangover.

Great service and great food.
Love the ziosk for fast check out.
Also has game apps you can play for.
99 cents.
Great for keeping the kids entertained.

Be forewarned.
This restaurant has a new device at the table that allows you to play games, reorder drinks and pay your bill.
However it has teaser ads for the games and if you press the screen at all it will charge you to play.
There are a ton of bars in the area (Native New Yorker, etc.
) that allow the trivia play for free.
Nice try Chili's but I will never touch that thing again.
