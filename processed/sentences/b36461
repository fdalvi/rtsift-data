They have the pest services with a good Price , I will never go to any anther place :)

My camry's ac locked up for the final time... Billy quoted me $400 less than the Toyota dealership, and stuck true to his word.
They have amazing service and were willing to work around my schedule, even offering to give me a ride to work from the shops and pick me after my car was done being serviced.
I will definitely be going back there for any major services.
Plus, they have two sweet 80's Ferraris (a la Christy Brinkley), massage chairs, and a bench press in their waiting room.
Something for everyone....

Billy has always been awesome to work with and works around our busy schedule.
Its important to find a great mechanic when moving to a new city and these guys are it.
They have never overcharged me or tried to sell me something I didn't need.
The guys at Fayad always take great care of us and our cars.We take the problem-prone Range Rover (POS) there and saved hundreds less than the dealership.
Not saying the RR is cured of its demons, but it is running.
:) These guys fix everything from a Ford to a $150k BMW.
They are knowledgeable in just about every car.
Give them a shot, they will not disappoint!

Great service at a great price, billy is the man.
Always around 50 percent less than what dealership charges!
