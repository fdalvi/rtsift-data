Candy Face Painting has been at several Yelp events and always seems to have a line of folks waiting to get colorful do-dads embellished on their cheeks .
uh,.
upper cheeks!
At Yelp Helps recently I received a big red swirly "Y" blazoned across my left cheek!

sheila is always so vibrant and excited to perform her face painting.

Sheila is a talented artist and very perfessional, I would highly recommend her for an event.
Great with kids.

As a skeptical person, I watched Sheila paint other faces before I would let her paint mine.
I was amazed, not only by the talent she had for her art, but the skill she had making even the most hyperactive children stay still long enough to paint their faces.
Sheila knows her art incredibly well, but what impressed me most was her interactions with the kids and parents as well.

Wonderful face painter ~ Super outgoing and sweet with the kids.
Will get everyone excited to get painted!
Great designs that are perfect for all ages.

Gorgeous face painting designs, always a line of happy kids!

Candy Face Painting came to our Day of Hope event and was the main attraction!
She was very professional and everyone loved her.
Such a talented artist with fun face painting ideas!
We will certainly use her for our events in the future!
