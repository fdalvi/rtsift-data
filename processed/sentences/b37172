A great place to stop for fuel or quick convenience items.
Great prices on items in the store, lots of gas pumps to help during the busy times

This gas station  is exacty as I expected.
It is easy to get to from both North and South Dessert Inn and it never has a HUGE line.

It's a gas station.
Nothing special.
The pumps look pretty disgusting.
The glass was too scratched up to see the numbers.
The entire place looks like it needs a good cleaning.

This gas station/mini mart is very convenient.
I don't buy gas here the prices are always high.
Maybe because it's on a major intersection, S. Decatur & Desert Inn.
They stay on deck with my favorite cigarillos.
Swisher Sweets Plain.
I can usually get my 24oz.
Bottles of my favorite cerveza Corona 2/$5.
They have sandwiches also.
Don't forget the slot machines lol.
