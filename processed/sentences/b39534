Nice brew pub, with excellent pilsner beer.
The fish and chips was outstanding as was the fresh cole slaw

I had lunch while waiting for a flight.
Ordered the butter salmon.
Chewy and dry.
Awefulllllll.

With an hour to go before my flight home, The Great Dane seemed like the best option for dinner.
The minestrone soup came from a can, but I'm giving them a hall pass since this is an airport location & it's probably much harder with the limited kitchen space to make fresh soup.
The prime rib wrap was definitely a nice dish.
It's like philly cheese steak in a wrap, with peppers & melted cheese.
Definitely cooked to the right temperature & the au jus was nice.
The fries weren't salty enough so I asked my server for a side of ranch.
Not great, but not awful.

We had over an hour until our flight.
Ordered a plain vegetable salad, nachos, and crop circle beer.
The beer was warm and flat and got a new one, which was only slightly better.
(And cost $8!
)  After about 40 minutes of waiting the waitress came over and asked us what our order was.
We then watched her go to her computer and put in our order.
With 15 minutes to boarding time, we finally got our salad (bread was forgotten) and then the nachos.
Probably won't go back.
