OLPH is a church that I have frequented over the years -- first when I used to visit Arizona on vacation as child and now as I have lived here as a resident over the years.
OLPH is a solid church with a welcoming parish and an inspirational and moving Mass.
With so many out of town guests frequenting our city, it can be difficult for them to find a nice church to attend while they are here.
Well, let me suggest OLPH.
As I mentioned, this Parish is welcoming to visitors and often goes out of their way to say a brief welcome to them during Sunday mass.
So why review a church?
Well, for one, even God's house of prayer deserves love on Yelp!
Plus, I want to make sure that the Catholics out there can read about a few good churches in the Valley -- at least ones I like!
Mass times:  Sunday - 6:15, 8:00, 9:30, 11:00 A.M., 5:30 P.M. Saturdays: 6:15, 8:30 A.M. & 5:30 P.M. (Vigil) Weekday Masses: 6:15, 8:30 A.M. & 12 Noon Holy Days: 6:15, 8:30 A.M., 12 Noon & 5:30 P.M.

I just returned to the Church after quite a long hiatus, and have really been welcomed into this parish.
Franky I am not sure if i would still be going if they weren't so welcoming!
If you are looking for a positive Catholic experience please try OLPH!

Sadly, the pastor announced his resignation for health reasons.
I overheard the cancer word in discussions after.
My prayers are with you Father.
