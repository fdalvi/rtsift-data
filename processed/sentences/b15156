This is my go to place for groceries and toiletries.
I'll check Safeway to see if they got any WOW SALES but usually Safeway is just riDICulous.
I walk into Fry's and every aisle I walk down I have an employee asking how I am doing and If i need help.
Sometimes the customers get a little to friendly too...yesterday some dude thought he knew me from some rehab center.
I congratulated him and went on my way.
Not something you wanna hear while your looking through Rib-eyes in a crowded supermarket.
The Sushi chefs are unappreciated, a lot of people cringe when i tell them i eat fry's sushi.
They are really nice, I always buy sushi when they are there because they make my special order of Inari and spicy tuna rolls.
Plus the speedy checkout is a plus.

Great deals on food, wonderful deli and even their gas prices beat Costco (U-10 GIANT scallops for $9.99/lb, Costco has smaller U-15 for $12.99/lb).
So long Costco, I'm dropping my card because Fry's is so competitive without the Costco membership fee.

The other day I stopped by Fry's deli to get a sandwich for lunch.
I decided to get a Boar's head panini.
I went home to get ready for work and forgot it at home!
I decided to heat it up for dinner and was pleasantly surprised.
It was seriously one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life!
I highly suggest you try one next time you go to Fry's.

I love this Fry's.
Every time I go grocery shopping, they are extremely helpful!
I especially love the woman at the sushi stand.
She is always extremely happy and makes my whole shopping experience better!
I use the self-checkout just to go faster, but there are never any lines!
Love the sales as well!

it's Fry's...
I like shopping here because I feel like I'm getting a good deal on groceries.
What really sets the place apart is the fuel points.
2x here 4x there.
I buy gift cards for my normal monthly expenses and it gives me the fuel points I need to save upwards of a $1 on gas.
We all need that!
I stopped in this location for sum fuel but I noticed their parking lot had covered parking due to their use of solar.
I've gotta say that impressed me.
saving them money but doing good things for the environment.
