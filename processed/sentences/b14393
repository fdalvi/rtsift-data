I contracted with Diana in May of 2012 to re-boot my wardrobe.
The experience was fun, enlightening, intense, painless, and gratifying!
I used three components of her services:  closet clean-out, personal shopping, and guided shopping.
First, she came to my house and we analyzed my closet.
She immediately felt like a new best friend, and the "pain" of letting go of old clothes was made logical and smooth.
The next step was for Diana to go out shopping, picking out clothes just for me!
[In the meantime, I also started shopping, to practice what she had just taught me.
]   She came back to my house in 3 weeks with a car-load of clothes.
I tried them on and we put together outfits (even using the old clothes that had passed the test).
She even bought jewelry and accessories, just little touches that really meant a lot in changing my outlook on how to dress and present myself.
Her guidance also helped me continue to shop over the summer, knowing what i had learned and using the new clothes to make decisions.
Finally, we met up again in the fall, because of course I also needed new fall clothes and we had to wait until the stores were stocked.
This time, we shopped together, which is another category of her services.
It was effortless and I couldn't believe how many items we found and bought in just one shopping day.
Certainly better choices and more fearless then I would have made on my own.
Her input and advice have stayed with me for almost 2 years now.
I'm still excited about the clothes she picked out.
It was and remains an amazing experience, because she still keeps in touch and follows up with me, checking in to see if there's anything I need.

Amazing is the best word to describe Diana!
As a person that hates to shop, but loves to look great, Diana is a life saver!
She came and took an inventory of my clothes and then really listed to what I was looking for (I needed a business/professional wardrobe for my new career).
Diana found some great new items that allowed me to utilize things I already had (and loved) but had nothing to go with it.
Diana also has an incredible talent for putting outfits together that look great for that client's body shape - stylish and flattering!
I have personally used Diana's services several times.
When my mom comes into town to visit, she also schedules Diana for a day of shopping.

I have a new best friend and her name is Diana.
You know how you really want to go shopping with your best friend cause they will tell you that you look hideous in that dress that you adore?
Well Diana is that person.
I told her my wardrobe was boring and needed some advice.
She took one look at my closet and not only agreed with me but told me exactly why it was boring.
Then she set out to change things.
I absolutely hate shopping because I never know what to choose and always end up with the same old stuff.
Diana solved that problem.
She arrived at my house with racks full of fun, colorful clothing much of which I would have passed up if I were shopping.
At first I was not sure about any of it because it was so far out of my comfort zone.
Boy was I wrong.
Once I started to try things on I could really see where I had been making mistakes in my wardrobe selection.
Diana patiently explained why the item she selected worked for my body type and coloring.
Each item I tried on was fantastic.
The only hard part of the day was whittling down the collection to fit my budget -- which wasn't really hard at all because she had found tons of deals!
I now own a fantastic summer LBD that cost $14!
The most important part of the service Diana offers is she provides total looks complete with jewelry, bags and shoes.
This was also a problem I had because I would often find a blouse I loved but when I got it home I had no idea what to pair it with.
Or I had a great dress and no jewelry that went with it.
I actually enjoy getting dressed in the mornings and can't wait to wear all the fabulous outfits Diana chose for me.
will be consulting with Diana on my summer and fall wardrobes for sure!

Diana is extremely delightful!
As a Realtor it is important to dress for success!
I turned 30 in December and my wardrobe had not changed since my early 20s.
I hate shopping so very rarely Added items to my wardrobe and stuck to the same five or six things.
Yes, seriously for years!
I first hired Diana to come help me organize and go through my current wardrobe.
She help me get rid of things that looked too juvenile, frumpy, did not flatter my body type or look professional.
I was then was left with a fairly skimpy closet.
Because I hate shopping I hired Diana to go out and shop on my behalf.
I could not have made a better decision!
What probably took her a couple of hours saved me days and thousands of dollars in time and money spent.
I love absolutely everything she brought to my home on her rolling rack.
I spent over two hours trying on clothes and talking about why these things look so great on me!
Clothes are not a "one type fits all" kind of thing and Diana really has a great understanding of body type and haircoloring as well as skin tone to pick out those amazing styles.
I am not exaggerating when I say that both people that know me well, as well as strangers, comment comment daily on my new outfits, purses, & shoes.
Diana is a permanent fixture in my life now.
I plan on having her come four times a year as well as reaching out for special events.
Diana, I cannot thank you enough for changing my life.
I'm excited to see the results in my professional life as well as my personal, dating life.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
