I mostly use Walgreens to fill my prescriptions, but occasionally pick up odds and ends here as well.
Pharmacy is great.
All the staff are very curious and helpful.
If you need your prescription right away, they can usually oblige, and have them ready in about 20 to 30 minutes or so.
The Pharmacists are very knowledgeable and make sure you understand your medications before you leave.

Review only for the Pharmacy.
Always friendly and fast service at the Pharmacy.
Scary that they know us by name!!!
Have been going to this Walgreens for the last 5 years.
Hardly any problems, if there is one they take care of it immediately.

Very busy, some of the employees are rude and my hubby needed some asthma pills which they have a card you have to give the pharmacy and they lady was well not very smart.....

Pharmacy staff is incompetant and rude.
My 10 month old needed a script badly and I had spoken to this pharmacy at 9:30am...after dealing with rude and disorganized staff most of the day they finally said my script would be ready at 5:30.
Sure enough after dragging my sick baby over there it wasn't ready.
They told me to come back at 7:00 which I did and it still wasn't ready...he saw me coming and rushed to the back to get it ready .
I would go to any other pharmacy given the choice and WILL NOT go back to this location again.

The cashiers are typically busy but always willing to say "welcome" and "thanks for coming in" with a genuine smile.
I typically only come here for the RedBox and pharmacy in which we have always had good service.

This is a 24 hour Walgreens Not much to say good service clean store friendly staff and knowledgeable
