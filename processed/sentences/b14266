Their furniture is well made but their return policy is poor.
They would not let me return a dining room table.
I called about a month or so after the delivery and continued to talk to the design consultant as well as the manager.
No one made any attempt to help me negotiate any type of resolution.
I offered to pay a restocking fee or the designers commission if that would help.
I thought they might give me store credit, but no.
The table is in perfect condition so I couldn't understand why they wouldn't take it back.
I'm not so sure I'll shop there again.

I almost feel bad giving Ethan Allen a single star but it is well deserved.
The furniture is super nice no doubt but for the money and the customer service no way.
I paid full price for my bedroom furniture 6K and was so frustrated was the horrendous service.
I am a young girl granted but I am convinced they thought I was broke just not a good experience and would NEVER go back too bad because they do have potential.... would probably do crate and barrel or pottery or a local place.
