This is a cool and VERY nice place to live!

This place is beautiful!!
Great dessert scenic views!!
Staff is very nice and helpful!!
If I had a problem, they were right there instantly!
This complex is awesome on community events!!!
Pool parties (which is a huge Olympic size pool!
), trunk or treat, Easter egg hunts, and plenty more!!
It is a great way to have everyone together and have have a lot of fun!
It is very close to the anthem outlets, if you love shopping like me!!
:) Also very close to a full shopping center and Anthem community park!

This place was great until they decided to bring in an outside management company.
They started writing threatening letters for no reason and now are charging for online rent payments when the prior policy was not to.
It's too bad, until then it was a great place and I've been here three years...but it won't be four

Horrible Management Company.
I would not reccomend this facility to anyone.
Agree with Jack S, this company adds extra fees without notification.
Mark Taylor ran this property well and Alliance is fradulent.

The grounds are well kept and the landscaping company is friendly and efficient.
The apartments themselves are nice enough but for the price could be nicer.
There are constantly young children in the roads who jump out while you drive by or stand in the road not moving out of the way, kicking balls at cars driving by, taking apart items at the park.
There is a shortage of parking.
There was constant work on the pool and ducks living in/near by it but it os heated.
They are on their third owners/management company in the last 2 years and they aren't the greatest.
I have never used the community center but it is basic.
They did offer community events fairly often in the fall/winter.
We loved the maintenance men!
