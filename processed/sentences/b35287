Creative Formalwear is a tuxedo rental company that delivers to Vegas.
Need I say more?
Their staff is very friendly and easy to work with and the online catalog has a lot of different styles to choose from.
If you have any questions, you can call them and they'll help you out.
My tuxedo was delivered to my hotel with a complimentary pair of socks (which was perfect because I'd forgotten mine) and everything fit perfectly.
Two of the guys in our group rented their tuxedos in advance and flew with them to Vegas.
They saw how easy my rental was and they wished they had done the same.
Save yourself time, hassle and money and rent from these guys.

I was disappointed in my Tuxedo Rental from Creative Formalwear.
On the Friday before the Wedding, the delivery of the Tuxedo was late by a couple of hours causing some unnecessary changes in my busy schedule that day.
Also, the Tux was the wrong size and I didn't get a correct size back to me until late the night before my wedding.
To their credit, they did pull it off at the last minute, but all the hassle to get it right made this a bad situation.

Chance helped me find the perfect wedding dress.
Jessy helped my husband find a cool zoot suit for our wedding.
The staff here are always friendly.

Great personal service!
Intimate setting!
Great selection!
They go above and beyond the call of duty!
