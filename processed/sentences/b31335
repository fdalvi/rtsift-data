Stephanie at fast fix helped me quite a few times with glitches and issues I had in the office, as well as most of my family members.
Really knows her stuff and very fairly priced.
Quick too!

I needed to boost my existing website and Stephanie was a great help.
FAST FIX SOLUTIONS was the ticket to my problem of managing time & money.
She is a very sharp gal and I recommend her for any of your computer headaches.

Stephanie was knowledgeable and went above and beyond to help me out and get my computer fixed.
She was reliable, fast and efficient.
I would definitely recommend her, I was very happy with her work.
