I have to agree with Ken's review, although its not recommended.
I have had the same experience with the apartment.
A lot of creepy people, and seriously the doggy do-do is a problem.
Also the north gate is broken and left open.
Plus they don't have a outgoing postal box.
You cant mail out a letter..
Strange.

my parents have lived here for 7 years, almost 8 I actually moved with them when I was pregnant with my son and moved out when he was about 3. the original staff was amazing but since then they have changed pretty often I think there's only one member who still remembers my son as a baby, and I'm not sure if that staff member is still there.
the apartments are nice decently in size the only negative thing is there are a lot of cats running around and they do nothing about it.
the cats do help with the bug problems but in order to get rid of the cats you yourself have to call animal control which pretty much charges you to get the cats.
it's a nice ok apartments and I actually know quite a few people who live here.

I have lived here for almost 2 months and so far so good.
Although it is a bit pricey, it is a good place to live.
I'm not sure about the other reviews.
I have yet to see any creepy people.
However, our neighbors are a bit odd but they don't mess with anyone.
Either the apartments are tightly sealed or I have very quiet neighbors.
There are many cats roaming around but I really don't mind them.
The staff is really nice and whenever maintenance is needed they come very quickly.
I would give it a 5 star if they had better prices!
lol
