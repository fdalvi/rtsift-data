This place sucks!!
I brought in on multiple occasions my own frames to put new lenses in and the shop said they wouldn't do it.
So I brought more frames in with the same frustrating outcome.
I decided to try the other location in east Madison just in case the staff at the Odana was just being jerks.
Sure enough the other location had all my frames with new lenses in them with in the hour.
No hassles, no run around.
So if you want to go to a eyemart express and not wait 20 minutes to be seen and have a staff that will actually help you, go to the east madison location and NOT the odana dr. location.

Eyemart Express and the Funkhouser staff offer horrible service and will try to nickle and dime you every opportunity that they can.
They won't offer an explanation, they'll just be rude and insistent.

I have been going to this location for several years, although after my last experience, I won't return.
There has always been an air of pish-posh snobbery here at EyeMart Express, and why, I can't begin to imagine.
The staff never says hello when you enter, perhaps they're overworked, or just having an off day, either way that is just not acceptable.
Furthermore, I agree with the previous reviewer about the "nickle-and-dime" culture they seem to have going on here.
They will seriously do anything for a buck.
Dr. "Funkhauser" herself has always been quite nice, but I'm afraid she must direct her staff to squeeze every penny out of patients.
Why else would they act this way?
There is clearly a deeper public relations issue going on here, and it is also clear that this location must address how they are being perceived- or many once loyal customers may do like I did, and go elsewhere.
