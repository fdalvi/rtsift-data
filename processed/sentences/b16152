great stock n book resource

Good place to check out if you're looking for a nice gift for someone special- bibles, music, books, and other neat stuff.
They also carry NOTW (Not Of This World) merchandise here as well which is cool.
If you're ever in the area, drop in, you may find somthing you like...ALOHA!!!
YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(17/100) "One Stop Christian Shop"

I always find something when I shop here!
They have a great selection of Christian books, fiction and nonfiction plus many different versions of Bibles.
There is a decent size section of music at reasonable prices.
The knick knacks and gifts area has many different ideas for all ages.
I find the staff helpful and they know where everything is and bring you to the area of the item that you are looking.
Sometimes they may be crazy busy at the register so you may have to either wait in line for your turn to ask a question.
