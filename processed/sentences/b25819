They are called Sr's Barber Shop, now.
Have visited this shop three times.
Usually two to three barbers and the two ladies have taken care of me on my visits.
Both do a good job to your direction.
Nice little place, usually get a chair right away, quality cut, and prices are very fair.
Can't beat that!
