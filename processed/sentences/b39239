I had One Eighty Q at Wordcamp Phoenix and it was awesome.
I love Phoenix food trucks and these guys did an excellent job.
I had the brisket over mac 'n' cheese.
The brisket was smokey and tender with an awesome barbecue sauce.
The mac 'n' cheese was perfect comfort food.
The staff was totally sweet too and told me the story of how they bought the truck in Florida and drove it across the country while they were making my lunch.
I highly recommend these guys.

Is 180Q for real?!
Last time I went out for First Friday I couldn't find their truck and ended up dropping $10 on a grilled cheese at another truck when what I truly wanted was 180Q's wicked brisket mac n' cheese.
After walking around a bit I found 180Q parked over at monOrchid.
They we're like "Yo, you guys hungry?!
" and we were like, "Yeah, we've been looking for you, but we spent all our money on grilled cheese!
" To my surprise, one of the gentlemen running 180Q (sorry I don't remember your name dude!
) offered us a free sample of their tacos and queso AND hooked us up with some banana pudding from their friend's food truck.
Again, is 180Q for real?!
Yes, and they're the best.
Customer-4-Lyfe.

just plain delicious

I hired these guys to cater a party, with 60 to 70 meals to be served.
They showed up exactly on time, handled the crowd like consummate professionals and the food was excellent!
My guests didn't have to wait long to be fully satisfied.
I highly recommend them for any big-assed party you host.
You know it's good when one of my guests says "Oh man, you've got to taste this chicken" and hands me some of the meat flowing off the bun.
They're homemade kettle chips are the bomb as well.
Two thumbs and two big toes up!
