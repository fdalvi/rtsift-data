I had a great overall experience at Studio B smiles.
The staff was friendly and attentive  throughout the entire process.
The receptionist provided information and told me her personal experience, the tech was gentle and fast, and Dr. Badolato had a great personality and made me feel very comfortable.
They provided blankets and gave me a choice of movies to watch.
I would recommend this great team of professionals to anyone looking to get dental work done.

This is a top notch dental office.
The staff is great and all of the equipment is the newest technology available.
Flat screens on the ceiling above every chair make grueling dental work seem like a breeze.
I would highly recommend this place!

I've been coming here for over 5 years on a co-workers recommendation.
In my opinion, he is the best you can find in the valley.
I've been to a lot of dentists in my life and I trust him, which means a LOT for someone who's had as much done as I have.
