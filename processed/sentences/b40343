Morrisons Local is a new mini supermarket at Shandwick place.
Now there is plenty of competition here being next to the Co-op & Sainsburys mini markets.
It is new and gleaming!
I like that they have an entrance and exit so the flow of people traffic is smooth and your not fighting to get around folk.
If you look out for good deals then you can get a pretty cheap lunch in here.
I got a veggie tripple sandwich for £1.69, now it was standard bread (rather than a fancy organic loaf) but it was tasty and filling and they do little bottles of sparkling flavoured water for 39p which is excellent and I had the Peach water.
So all in was £1.99, which in the centre of Edinburgh you would be hard pressed to get lunch for that good value.
It is a little far from my work to go regularly but I would certainly go back.
Good job!

I'll give it three stars as it's pretty small and isn't really needed in Shandwick place as there is already a Co-op and Sainsbury's, however, a bunch of 5 bananas in £1 - £1.05 in those supermarkets whereas in Morrisons they are... wait for it... 65p!
Bargain!

I am so glad this Morrisons Local is here!
Living in the city centre can conjure fears of dreaded expensive supermarket experiences but while this place is quite small, it doesn't feel like I'm paying double what I would be in a superstore a bit further out.
It's no Lidl or Aldi but they have some fierce specials, especially later in the evening, and it's darn convenient.
