Typical fast food burger joint.
Nothing special here.
We all know we should not be eating this kind of food, anyhow.

Decent location with the standard chain offerings.
It's close to our apartment so it's easy to stop here on the way to / from work for a quick bite.
The food is made correctly and comes out hot.
The staff is friendly and efficient with keeping the line down both inside and in the drive-thru.
This location can be busy during the rush times, which is true of just about any fast food place as long as they are a decent stop.
I'm sure I'll be back here again for a quick and easy meal with an "a-ok" vibe.

4 cars in front of us.. Been waiting for 15 min.. now I don't blame the cooks or customer service as they were very courteous but the AWFUL management that understaff  this locations ... seriously some leads needs to be replace there..
