This pizza place is in the food court of the Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas.
It's similar to sbarro's, but has more varieties of pizza toppings.
The chicken & veggie and mushroom pizza is very good!
There's also some pasta, salad, and garlic bread.

Overcooked to begin with and outrageously expensive: two things that characterize this pizza joint.
While food in Vegas is generally not that cheap, for a place in a food court, you would come to expect a certain level of quality and price associated with fast food.
This establishment fell far below even our lowest standards and we actually wish we went to the next door McDonalds instead.
In terms of what was actually wrong with the Pizza, the crust and main body was overcooked, tough, and drier than Vegas soil.
The toppings were sparse to begin with and were also overcooked.
This really gross slice of pizza cost $6.95 but really should have been on the dollar section of a run down pizza joint.
The employees were surly, curt, and were the nail in the coffin for this review.
Please save your money, your stomach, and your time and go somewhere else.

The pizza is good for a quick bite, but the service, even a simple greeting sucks...
I know I have tattoos and it's a busy Las Vegas food court but show some effort.
