Love the Hap's!
For those times that I feel the need for some edible smokey goodness (as opposed to the brownie type), I almost always head over to Hap's Pit Barbeque.
It could be because they are just down the road, but I do find myself craving their pulled pork sandwich or the KCS Ribs now and again.
Unlike the other Hap's location, this one is generally lacking the line, although it can get busy at lunch time.
You can easily satisfy your bbq cravings for under 10$ a person, but samplers and slabs will run you a little more.
They also have an okay selection beers and ales to wash it all down with.
Hap's is best known for a couple of items.
1) The KCS ribs are IMO the best you can get in the city.
They are fall off the bone tender, full of meat, and spiced with the perfect amount of hickory smoke infusion and sauce.
2) The cornbread is cake-like and sinfully good (perfect for slopping up that extra sauce).
3) The pulled-pork is slap your momma good!!!
All of that is fine and dandy, but the best part of this location is the drive-through.
I mean seriously, I can scrunchie the hair (yes I still wear scrunchies), pile my PJ'd self in the car and get all of this finger lickin goodness in a 10 minute turn-around trip from door to door.
Where else am I going to satisfy that 8:45 p.m. need for bbq?!!
And if you are too lazy to go and get it, Hap's provides free delivery from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. for the following area:                     Glendale 67th Ave                           Central                    Van Buren  If you are hankering for some good down-home barbeque, then head over to Hap's on the westside and order you up a "Tub O' Tips" (seriously that is a menu item) and you should be shoutin' out "Sewie" Deliverance style faster than two shakes of a lambs tail.

Hap's was my SPOT in PHX!
By far the best pulled pork BBQ in the area.
I tried Honey Bear multiple times and it does not compare to Haps.
Mashed potatoes are deliciously homemade.
