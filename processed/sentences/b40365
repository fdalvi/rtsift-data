I came across this company on Groupon and have tried several other agencies in the past with so-so luck.
I was hesitant to try yet another one, but figured I'd give them a try and believe it or not they did a wonderful job!
The house looks fantastic and I would recommend them to my friends and family!
Honest and humble, great prices and wonderful customer service!!
Thanks Javi for being so helpful!!

We had both sides of the family coming to visit, so I purchased a Living Social deal for two hours of deep cleaning.
I was a little leery because the last Living Social deal I bought for cleaning services, did not work out AT ALL (and thankfully I received a refund for that awful experience).
Prismaclean put all my fears to rest and I was so impressed with their professionalism and service!
Javier was very helpful with our initial contact through text and also called the day before to confirm my appointment.
(These were already major bonus points with me, because the last maid service I tried to use didn't do either!
)  The two women who came were very nice and got right to work.
I wasn't sure how much they could do in two hours, so I asked that they simply focus on our kitchen and two bathrooms.
They blew me away with how much and how well they cleaned every single room in those two hours!
Excellent job and will definitely be using them again in the future.

The best maid service I've ever used.
Professional all the way.
I had tried other cleaning services and was so disappointed.
Javier runs a great business with a great crew.
I will not use any other service.
