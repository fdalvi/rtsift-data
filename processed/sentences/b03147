STAY AWAY!
Had a horrible experince.
The staff is so rude and grumpy.
Not to mention I was told I had to have surgery when I didnt need it.
This is a "do more, bill more" clinic

This place is horrible!!!
The staff is very rude and they don't have respect for there patients.
The doctors are also not friendly!!!
Office is VERYdirty!!
Wouldn't recommend this place!
