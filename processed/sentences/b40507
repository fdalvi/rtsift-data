Rick the Pool Dude is the main dude I would trust with my pool.
I've had some issues with previous companies and Rick is the most knowledgable of the business.
From a minor leak I had to maintaining my pool, Rick does a great job.
He is prompt and gets the job done how it should be.
I wouldn't call anyone else but Rick the Pool Dude.

I have Rick clean my pool weekly and keep up with the standard maintenance.
He always comes when he says he will and always does a great job.
I have dealt with pool men who have decided not to show up one week without notice, so I am grateful for his reliability.
I have also needed him to do a repair on my pool pump, which he gave me a great price for and I haven't had an issue with it since.
Definitely recommend him!

I called to get an estimate for monthly pool service because I was having problems with algae growing on the sides of my pool.
Rick came out as scheduled and gave me a very reasonable fee for monthly cleaning.
He came back the following day to clean the pool.
He did a great job, got the chemical levels where they should be and within 24 hrs no more algae!
My pool looks great, he has been dependable and  good price for monthly service.
I would recommend, certainly will make my day off more enjoyable, no more stress over cleaning the pool, now I can relax and enjoy it.
Thanks rick!
