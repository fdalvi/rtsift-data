My family and I think this is the best church.
So active in the community.
Very comfortable and family friendly.
A great group of Christians offering a variety of options for worship, small group, bible study and fellowship.

I love being a part of this church.
There is a wonderful music program.
Amazing outreach to the community and an incredible children's program!
