i met janet while she was at cha-cha mifflin.
i followed her when she started her own salon, and haven't looked back!
her cuts are fabulous and fairly priced.
(and on top of all that, she's a really awesome chick.
) you should definitely check out glamdring if you're sick of paying too much for a sub-par haircut.

I met Janet about a year ago and started seeing her professionally about 2 months ago.
I already know I will never go to anyone else, ever.
Take it from someone who has had many stylist along with many different cuts & colors.
Janet pretty much knows what I'm thinking and does it.
She's made a hard to please girl very happy!
Her salon is colorful, fun and full of treasures (along with some fabulous products).
Janet makes you feel beautiful inside and out.
I'd recommend her to anyone who is tired of getting the same old cut/color and ready to be a one of a kind original.
Thank you, Glamdring!

I just had my hair cut and colored by Janet for the third time-- it is FABULOUS!
No doubt the best stylist in Madison and probably the best cuts I've EVER had.
For years I would drive to Milwaukee to get my hair done, as I was convinced there was nobody in town that could style my THICK and curly hair.
SO glad I found her!!
I've seen her work on other clients while I was in the salon and was very impressed with what I saw.
She is very up on trends, if not ahead of them.
She also carries awesome hair products that rock.
If you're pondering where to go, stop looking and book with Janet!
