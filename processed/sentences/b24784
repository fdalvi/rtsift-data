I saw Dr. Keeling-Johnson and was very impressed with all aspects of my care.
The whole facility seemed well run and worth trusting with my health.

I recently had to have surgery and I chose this place because of a strong recommendation for Dr. Buckmire.
And I have to say, he was wonderful.
He explained everything to me so I completely understood, and was kind and attentive.
His staff are all wonderful too.
I highly recommend him and this office.

I had my gall bladder removed in 2012 by DR Jennifer Reitz who is out of their Gilbert office.
She did a great job with that surgery and in the process found a hernia that needed to be taken care of.
Moving forward to Oct of 2013 I find out that I need a hysterectomy I wanted to hernia done at the same time so I would only need to recover from surgery once.
She agreed to the surgery and was great until it was determined my wound was not healing.
She went back in and cleaned it up--but did not address a seroma that was under to mesh she had placed.
I have this mesh with an infection under it that she places a wound vac on and cannot figure out why I am in so much pain.
The end result was my demanding the wound vac be removed.
Then DR Reitz in cohoots with Amy from Cozy Home Care decided I was suicidal and that something needed to be done with the wound.
She called me and told me to come to Mercy Gilbert where I was to be a direct admit.
Come to find out she did not have the authority to do this and I ended up going through the ER where she handed me to a group of animals who physically assaulted me and then I was thrown against my will on a psych hold.
Had all of my personal belongings taken away including my underwear.
She responds with a "I didn't mean to do that"  Problem is the damage is done.
Do not trust this woman...she is lazy or was too lazy to do a cat scan to find the darn inection.
