This was the post office of choice for most of the Pollock Hall students (Edinburgh University's catered halls of residence) as it's location on South Clerk street was very convenient.
It was here I first realized how cheap the UK post is, and it's a rare item or service that will cost over Â£4.
At least nothing I've done (apart from express sending olive oil soap to sweden- was an emergency!
) has been that pricey.
It's also possible to exchange currencies, and for the unprepared folk like me that turn up at the post office with the item or letter in hand, there's a separate cashier to buy all sorts of envelopes and packaging, as well as an extensive range of greeting cards and post cards.

This post office also double-times to sell cards and other stationary-type items, but it feels quite old and event a bit dingy inside.
The first time I went, the queue was so long that I had to leave and come back later.
When I returned, things were much better and the staff was friendly, but it still wasn't the most amazing customer experience at a post office.

Great post office!
The guy that works there is THE BEST!!
USA or UK, he has then all beat!!
