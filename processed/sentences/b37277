Amazing customer service and genuine interest in how they can help me.
I couldn't believe how nice the banker helping me was.

Today certainly validated my decision to close all my accounts with Wells Fargo.
Elisabeth was of no help when i simply wanted to make an update to the auto draft I had on my IRA.
First she told me she couldn't do it then after I told her I had updated it with a form in a branch before she called in for help and they would send her the form.
After waiting for 10 minutes and still nothing I left.
Additionally what happened to a professional dress for a banker.
Jeans, tennis shoes and a football jersey is not it.

The worst branch!
There is always a line, and you always have to wait to speak to a business banker.
They are so understaffed here.
The branch manager always asks me how am I doing and what he can do to better my experience but the experience is never different!
Get a clue!
The only person who knows what they are doing is val.
