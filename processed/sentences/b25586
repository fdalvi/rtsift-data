Now I am all for a good deal.
I know a place like this is where you go if you are not expecting much other than something simple, and that is just what I was lookin for.
As I am getting older my hair is not as thick as it use to be and being a guy just wanted something simple.
I ended up with the worst haircut I have had in a long time.
I did not get the name of the girl but she had tattoos all over her arm.
My first thought was that she was really cool.
(not so much) I thought it would be pretty hard to mess my hair up being so thin and all.
She found a way.
It was like my hair had amnesia it did not remember how to lay down.
It stuck up here and there and I thought I had a part somewhere but it was gone now.
There was nothing I could do except wait for it to grow out.
Thank goodness were are living in a time where iduividuality in hair style is in so, I just went for what was called the onion look.
However there is an African American woman who works there who once cut my hair and she is really, really good.
I should have went with my gut and waited for her, but I will not be going back there again.

i`ve had a bad haircut before but not like this.
its not even fixable.
not that i would set foot in the door again anyway.
no idea what the womans name is that cut my hair but you could tell i was bothering her  by asking for a haircut.
never said a word, never bothered to ask if it was an ok haircut etc..now i get to look like an idiot til this crap grows out.
thanks lady.

don't usually go here but I was a in a bit of a bind.
needed a haircut quick, reserves purposes.
and my usual place was closed.
I tried it and tried to explain the haircut before, during, and after.
hairstylist continued to cut it her way.
didn't really like it but it was to army standards, good enough for the weekend.
for what they charge, not worth it.
won't happen again
