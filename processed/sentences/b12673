Located in the Forum Shops at  Caesar's Palace  This store is the Las Vegas branch of the famous British toiletry store founded in the late 19th century.
There products are limited in quantity but that is because the quality is amazing.
You'll feel like royalty while shopping in this store (or better yet,make your loved ones feel like royalty by buying them something here).
Perfumes, colognes, soaps, travel cases, home scents, and even a silver spoon for your baby make this a great place to go when you are in need of pampering.
Highly recommended for anglophiles.
:) My only criticism is that the shop is in Caesars and for me that is always a pain to navigate.

This shop is currently at the Wynn.
The product line is cruelty free and has no artificial fixatives or chemical additives.
Their Bluebell fragrance was a favorite of Princess Di and they also have fragrances for women, men, and gender neutral fragrances as well.
They have fragrances such as English Fern, Lily, Elizabethan Rose, etc.
and are very fresh, light  and memorable.

Love that the people know so much about their product.
The man was super nice and informative and gave us free samples!
