Really cute little cafe and espresso bar with beer, wine, and booze.
I just went to grab lunch real quick, but I decided to stay and eat since I had a few extra minutes.
The iced tea was really good, unsweetened with a hint of some fruit, maybe peach.
I ordered the portobello sandwich and substituted a side salad for the fries or pasta.
The sandwich was a grilled mushroom with cheese and pesto on grilled bread.
The salad was a garden salad with romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, shredded carrots, shredded cheese, croutons and my requested balsamic vinaigrette.
Simple yet tasty.
I enjoyed my meal but I would make one suggestion: put a piece of lettuce between the mushroom and bread.
My bottom piece of bread got a bit soggy.
It still tasted good, but if I took it back to the clinic like I planned, it would have become mush.

I have only been to this cafe once, which is important to note, since I think if I could visit more often over time, I would bet that my experience would be better.
This restaurant is absolutely charming and feels to me like a neighborhood diner probably once felt.
Both the people behind the counter and the people in front of the counter seem to know and like one another.
The staff is VERY friendly.
The restaurant is spotless.
And the food arrived quickly, which [being impatient] I loved.
I ordered the BLT, and it was average, nothing too special.
But the price was right: $6.50, including chips/french fries and coleslaw.
Gotta love that.
Again, I want to return because the menu is large enough that there probably is a sandwich or two that they do REALLY well.
Maybe I just picked a bad one.

My wife and I have been here twice for breakfast and enjoyed it greatly both times.
They make an awesome latte and the fried egg sandwich is yummy.
Both times we visited the staff has been extremely friendly and attentive.
The menu is fairly basic, but everything we have tried was made perfectly.
We will be going back.

I entered the cafe for the first time and was unsure of whether to take a seat, so I approached the cash register.
After a period of between five and ten minutes, I placed my order.
After ordering, I was asked whether I wanted fries with my order, and that, my friends, was the first verbal communication I was granted.
In case you missed it, no one spoke to me until after I placed my order.
Not even, what would you like; just a look.
So I took my food to go, and don't plan on returning.
The reuben was actually quite good, but even that does not compel me to give a rating of more than one star.

A cute little cafe in south scottsdale that you probably drive by every day and never pay attention to.
We stopped in after searching Yelp for breakfast, and were pleasantly  surprised.
The decor is cute and clean (not diner, but not chic...just comfy), the staff is friendly and the food is solid.
The average age in the place is pretty high, probably considering it's next to an elderly residence center (what's the PC way to say that??).
The menu is standard, so don't expect any surprises, but their specialty coffees are great.

This is definitely a south Scottsdale hidden gem that has turned into one of my favorite places to grab lunch during the work week.
The first time I discovered them was due to the fact that they had breakfast all day.
And well, if you know me, you know this usually brings a place up a notch in my book.
I love my breakfast.
Their heaven sent omelet is spectacular.
Their italian soda comes with cream on the side so you can add as much as you want.
Yum!!
Additionally the grilled cheese is to die for.
I am *not* a fan of tomatoes at all but for some reason their tomato bisque I actually somewhat enjoy.
And it comes with cheddar goldfish.
Oh yes.
And this isn't a kids meal either.
If you're a Chicago native or Chicago sports fan (which I am not), you will be especially impressed.

I struggle to find what people like about this place.
Food is mediocre, service is typically slow, prices are nothing special.
It doesn't have a local/quaint atmosphere to help it along either.
Everything about this place is completely shruggable.
If there is no place left on your list to go, by all means eat here.
But for me, I'll pass.

Nice atmosphere, good food!
They cooked my eggs perfect.
Very casual, homey style service.

I waffled between 3 & 4 for a bit... but I'll give it the benefit of there not being a 1/2 star rating.
Plain and simple, this is just a rock-solid breakfast option.
It's not going to be the fanciest, or the most gourmet, or have the biggest servings... but it's always going to be good, the waitresses will always be nice, they'll rarely (if ever?
) mess up your order, and they're perfectly reasonable on price.
I realize I'm not making this a very sexy review, but honestly... sometimes 1+1+1=4.
For me, i like supporting a family-owned place that i know is going to be dependable, and that i know won't have a line out the door.
This is by no means a "destination" place.
(sorry Temptations.
)  A couple of tips; check the whiteboard at the far wall by the kitchen; it has daily special items listed that the waitresses will never mention otherwise.
(i came here many, many times before i ever noticed.
) Also, I typically sit at the main counter, but i have noticed that service seems to get incrementally worse the further you get from bar seating.
Sit outside if you want peace from your server and don't care about coffee refills.

Friendly service and great food!
Tucked away just down the street from my home, I lived in the neighborhood 2 years before I discovered this breakfast/lunch gem!
I recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a good breakfast in a relaxed atmosphere.
Reasonably priced with homey decor and a staff that knows how to treat people like people.

This is a very simple neighborhood homely breakfast/lunch diner with a Chicago Theme with a Cheers kinda feel to it.
The owner, Mylo, is a typical Chicagoian with all the Midwest swag.
He's one big flirt I tell ya and is honestly lovable!
My personal favorite on the menu is the BLT.
I like to order my sandwich with a side of fries, but they have homemade chips or a side salad as an option for the sandwiches.
One of my issues with this restaurant would be the fact that they also serve home fries, but you can't order a side of home fries with your sandwich.
I've never been able to understand why.
They always offer various specials, soup and dessert of the day.
The coffee at Temptations is very good.
One Saturday morning I stop through there and the owner suggests that I nab a cup of the coffee.
It was very good.
If you stop in here, you will really enjoy it.
Look for the word, "Cafe" on the building and you'll be there.

I stopped at Temptations Cafe today.
I love the locally owned businesses in Scottsdale and had heard good things about this Cafe.
I was pleasabtly surprised and left 100% satisfied.
I had the Country Fried Steak which came with 2 eggs and a delicious biscuit.
Coffee was great.
Friendly attentitive staff could not have been nicer and was interested in my happiness during my visit.
The owner Nancy came out and spoke with me and made me feel like I was a regular.
She has that right as we will be back every weekend.

OMG, I love this place.
It's very close to my house, and it's been there all along - I am writing this as a reminder to myself to go here more often.
The owners are the sweetest people ever.
Best iced coffee within a mile of my house.
My girlfriend used to pick up breakfast for us from here on weekends, but then Pesto Prima opened up and we started doing that.
Well, we are going to have to start alternating.
The food here is fantastic.
I feel kinda guilty for not going here much over the last year, but I'm definitely glad I rediscovered this place.
I mean, if you want to roll up to Breakfast Club in the clothes you slept in and wait in line for average eggs and bacon and sub-par coffee so you can be "seen" out to brunch - that's what you're going to do - if you want awesome food and coffee in a sweet little cafe, then come here.
The owner said they might start delivering soon - if that happens, holy cow.
*crosses fingers*

Good food.
Good coffee.
Good people.
We even brought our dog along for breakfast and he was welcome.
Great little place with yummy and reasonable food prices and friendly service.

With its Chicago roots, this is a nice family owned and operated breakfast spot.
It's tucked away in a nondescript strip mall, yet holds lots of charm and some great morning options.
For seating, you can watch TV from the bar or pick from the handful of tables inside or out on the patio.
When the weather gets nice, I love sitting outside with a fresh cup of coffee.
Did I mention they have an espresso machine?
Sometimes it can get busy, but I've never been turned away despite the quaint size.
You can choose a traditional breakfast option (all of them are good) or go with a fancy selection from the whiteboard in the front.
The eggs are cooked really well and the biscuits and gravy are always a smart choice.
The food comes out fast and I'm never disappointed.
I've never ordered lunch but my friends' dishes looked pretty tasty.
The french fries are solid.

Great food and service!
Been here a few times with my boyfriend and we are always pleased!
We are gluten free so there isn't much for us there but so good when we want to cheat (on gluten free) or for a continental breakfast.
Oh ya and great coffee drinks!

Average cafe fare.
With few reviews and not enough detail, there was not much to go on for making our food choices.
The reuben was ok. Not great.
The breakfast burrito the same.
Nothing wrong but nothing that I will remember tomorrow either.
If I wasn't in Phoenix Scottsdale area but rather a small town, I would be thankful.
It felt small town good.
Unfortunately I will be tempted to go elsewhere.

When my girlfriend and I moved to Arizona from Pennsylvania, this was the first food/customer service experience we had and we couldn't be more PLEASED!
Milo & Nancy (adorable Chicagoans) stopped to chat with us about life, love, sports and barbershops.
They gave us some great pointers and EVEN BETTER FOOD!
Our breakfast was DELICIOUS and affordable.
One visit down...a million more to go!
Check out this sweet little diamond in the rough!

I adore this little restaurant!
I love the employees AND the food.
The service is impeccable, it's fast AND friendly.
My boyfriend and I love coming here for breakfast on the weekends.
Don't ever leave!

Milo and Nancy are the best, food is awesome!
Support this local cafe you won't be disappointed

When I wrote my first review, I had just started dining here, and now I'm a regular!
We go almost every weekend for at least one meal.
My 2 year old is the unofficial host every time we're there, haha.
What an amazingly friendly place, the staff (and the customers!
) are all so amazing.
The food is definitely worth the trip, everything from the omelettes, club sandwich, burgers, and fantastic coffee makes Temptations Cafe a stop for any local or tourist looking for a great place.

Expectations fully met and then some.
My definition of 5 stars!
Temptations Cafe just really great breakfast food, with super friendly service (owners mindset, come to think of it, that probably was one of the owners!).
Nice menu with a bit of everything to cover the breakfast scene.
Eggs, pancakes, oatmeal, espresso drinks, etc., etc.
Most important, a nice patio with some shade that is dog friendly!
Staff immediately brought us a nice cold bowl of water for our pup.
Highly recommended for breakfast anytime of day.

The food was good, but the service was lacking.
5 tables of two people and three servers and did not check back once to see if I needed anything or if everything was okay, would have been nice to have gotten more water.

We love this breakfast spot.
Beth gives us great service, and always gives our puppy fresh water in their outdoor patio.
Amazing home style breakfast, try the egg sandwich with rye!

This place is a cute Chicago family owned and operated neighborhood breakfast spot.
It's a place where everybody knows your name.
It's a cafe full of regulars, Chicago sports memorabilia, great food, and fantastic service!
The loaded scramble and the breakfast burrito are my favs, although the last time I ate here I had the French toast with strawberries and that could easily be a new favorite.
There's bar seating with a tv showing sports.
Feel free to ask for the paper!
There's also a handful of seating inside and out on the patio.
The food is yummy and reasonably priced.

I don't review much but thought I have to give this place the time.
Originally saw them on bringfido.com so I can bring my dog and have breakfast someplace.
From the moment my dog and I walked up to the patio the ladies that work here were amazing.
Brought a bowl of water and coffee so fast- and made us feel so welcome.
They have huge moveable umbrellas and the whole patio is covered by a wood roof overhang so even at 10 am in scottsdale it's not too Hot.
Oh and the food-awesome!
