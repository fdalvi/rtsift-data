The Classic Grille is a hamburger place in the food court of the of Fiesta Mall.
We had excellent hamburgers a with real meat and they make their own patties, fresh ingredients in a nice toasted bun.
I really like that crunchy toasted bun.
The french fries were a little better than average.
At first I didn't think the chocolate milkshake tasted very "malty" but when I started slipping it out of the straw instead of eating it with the spoon off the top  I began to taste the rich malt flavor.
It was made with real ice cream too, you could tell.
I even doubled back and told the employees how good everything was.
I paid about 14 dollars for 2 meals including a $4 dollar malt which I didn't think was bad.
I would definitely go back, and I'm not a big hamburger fan.
Just when it's done right!
Dec. 10,2012: Came back here tonight because the Catfish Grille was closed, which I mentioned to the employee, who then told me about their fish items including a Grilled Tilapia sandwich on toasted bread.
It was under $6 including fries and really good.
You can tell quality of ingredients and preparation is important to these guys.
I'll bet their fish and chips are good too.
I'll have to try them next time.
They are super nice to you too.
They need to give lessons to that server over at Village Inn!

My friend just ordered a sandwich from here and the bottom her bread has mold on it.
How disgusting.
It should deserve 0 stars but it wouldn't allow me to.
This mall is really going down hill into the dumps
