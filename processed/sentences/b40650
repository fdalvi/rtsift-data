I created my account finally just to make note that this location is one mile away from the hotel I'm staying at (downtown Phoenix across from u.s. Airways center and it's "not in their delivery range".
Between that and the other location that closes at 5:00 on friday and Saturday I'm not really sure how jimmy johns stays in business

Visited this location March 2014 during First Friday Art Walk, missed the sign on the door & did not learn until after I'd received my food that restrooms were closed.
Employees would not budge when I suggested that as a paying customer I should be able to use the restroom, was told that it was out of their hands, regional manager had told them to shut restrooms down so all the people out for art walk would not wander in just to use restrooms.
Understand their frustration with being used for public restroom, but hey, it's one night & probably brings a lot of extra business in.
Seems that a business would want to support a community event like First Friday & people do have to go somewhere.
Very disappointing.
Very mean spirited.

$5 sub, that was plain.
I had to ask for mustard...
Doesn't that usually come in a sandwich?
Also, it said on the menu, cucumbers... False advertising, much.
Their bathroom was clean, and decorated funny, though.

This was by far the WORST experience that I have had at a Jimmy Johns.
The staff appeared to not enjoy being there, I asked for hot peppers and my sandwich cut in half and got home to realize that neither happened and my sandwich barely had any dressing.
It was also freaky slow.
Disappointing because I typically love grabbing a Jimmy!
