A very nice selection of fish and accessories.Open late.
The staff is very friendly & helpful and it is usually busy with people.
You may have seen this place on Criss Angel Mindfreak in an episode where he made a chick appear out of nowhere in an aquarium.
Amazing!
It's worth Stopping  in to check it out.!

We were in Vegas for vacation and decided to check out this Aquarium store before we left.
They had a few nice looking fish, but after seeing all the amazing sea-life at Caesar's and Mandalay Bay, it was not sensational.
The salt-water fish seemed to be more interesting than the fresh water.
The coolest thing about this store was their variety of sea anemones.
They also had a large selection of new fish tanks.

The tropical fish market in Vegas is horrible.
Not a bad selection and great staff.
Picked up two gold compressiceps for my brothers tank.
I thought the prices were high in my town but  Vegas is almost double, probably because there is not much competition.
Closed on Sundays!

I've been in and out of this store since I was in middle school.
It's a great shop that has a knowledgable staff and a good selection of fish.
Equipment and accessories are a little over priced, but I go there for the fish.
They have both a saltwater and a freshwater selection, and new fish arrive every Thursday.
I've purchases a dwarf lionfish, snowflake eel, lots of live rock, some tetras, and other random fish that were/are in healthy condition.
I occasionally go by to pick up some ghost shrimp for my fish to munch on (5 for $1).
Even for a browse, it's fun to visit.
Sometimes they have barracudas, seahorses, stingrays, etc.

Due to the fact that Las Vegas is a desert and the tropical fish scene is just not what it would be in LA or Boston we only have 3 or 4 fish shops that are not the big box stores.
(shipping fish to the desert kills everyone) With that said the team at Trop does their best to find some cool gems to fill their tanks.
They have a modest SW selection and also stock some FW oddballs.
The prices are fair but you may need to do some haggling to get the best prices.
The staff is knowledgeable and always eager to help.
They have a fair buy-back program and will special order just about anything you'd like.
They always have a full feeder tank as well.
I would give them 5 stars but there is not a fish shop in LV that could meet that mark unfortunately.
If you have tanks a weekly stop into Trop is not a bad idea.
Also on Tuesdays its 2 for one day on all fish under $10.
Give it a look.

WORST FISH STORE IN VEGAS!!!!
The CUSTOMER SERVICE is TERRIBLE.
The fresh water SELECTION IS POOR, but the salt water selection is worse.
Their tanks are overstocked, dirty, and most tanks have MULTIPLE DEAD FISH floating around.
I went in recently to give them thirty, 4 month old swordtail fry that where about 3/4 of an inch long, and thought they might give me enough store credit to buy some fish food.
After waiting for 15 minutes for the female employees to stop flirting with other customers, they said the store policy is that if the fish are not 1 inch long they don't give store credit.... Really?
What about fish that their max length is 1 inch or less?
I wasn't mad that they wouldn't give the $5 fish food free, just mad at the way they treat customers.
I wanted my fry to go to a good new home, but after seeing the terrible conditions of the tank they were put in I'm guessing half will be dead before that can happen.
In conclusion I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO TROP-AQUARIUM IN MY LIFE!!!
BLUE REEF AQUATICS will except fry and have pleasant customer service, however they are in North Vegas, a 45 minute drive from Henderson.
REPTILES & REEFS- WITH OUT A DOUBT THE BEST FISH STORE IN HENDERSON/VEGAS for one reason EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!
Knowledgeable friendly staff that genuinely want to help.
The store is small but has an excellent selection of coral and salt water fish (no fresh fish).
Also if there is a particular fish you want that they don't have they will find it for you.
They personally drive to California once a week and pick out each individual fish that enters their store, thus all of their fish are healthy with amazing colors.
The reptile selection is of equal quality.
Strongly recommend you check them out.

So far, so good...I just moved to The Valley 4 months ago and was looking to get a couple of large tank setups.
As is common knowledge, Las Vegas does not have an abundance of quality aquarium/tropical fish stores and I'm not really crazy about buying tanks and stands thru the large mall/corporate stores like Petco, etc.
What can I say?
A little far to drive from my home in Centennial Hills, but a family owned business for more than 20 years.
SCREAMING deals on tanks and stands...they BEAT everyone else in town hands down on price...and like most stores, they dont play the game of selling you the tank at a great price only to make you pay 3X as much for a cabinet stand.
They sell custom order stands and cabinets made LOCALLY and sold unfinished for REALLY fair price!
I bought an 84 gallon long tank with glass top for $99...and a custom stand for $75!
If you dont mind staining and clear coating the stand yourself...(mine will be stained to match my stairwell bannisters) you can save BIG $ and get EXACTLY what you want.
Very friendly and helpful staff...seemingly good selection of fish and fair prices.
The only reason I didnt give 5 stars is that I want to wait until my tanks and stands arrive and I complete their setup.
After that, I'll be back to updaye my review based on my COMPLETED shopping experience with them.
GOOD store, friendly people...the BEST prices on tanks and cabinet stands.

Trop Aquarium has always be good to me.
Friendly staff and a good selection of salt water fish.
Prices are reasonable compared others in town.
They have a small but nice reef selection.
they have ordered the hard to find fish for me, and didn't rape me on the price.

This is one of two aquarium stores that I frequent, and to be honest, I frequent it more because it's close, than because it's good.
(I have salt water fish, so my experience, and thus my review, are based solely on their salt water selection, not their fresh water) On the plus side, they always have an above average selection of fish.
Many of the smaller stores will fall back on stocking ONLY small, less-expensive fish, that are either safe choices because they will definitely sell, or safe choices because they are hardy enough to last until they do.
Trop actually goes out on a limb, and regularly stocks some really amazing specimens, which is somewhat rare in the industry, because it's a gamble for a store to buy livestock in the $100+ range, and run the risk of having the fish die before they sell it.
It shows that they have a confidence in their aquatic system, and the knowledge to be able to responsibly sustain life.
On the downside, there are only a couple of people that work there that have ACTUAL knowledge.
So when you ask a question, sometimes you will get an honest answer from a knowledgeable, responsible adult.
Other times, you will get a younger person, who instead of admitting that they don't know, they will make something up.
I hate that, and I have tested that theory many times in this store, as I myself have a pretty good knowledge of the hobby, so I'll often throw out test questions to gauge their integrity.
Also, they'll sell you anything you want to buy, without asking compatibility questions,  and without telling you (or possibly without knowing) that something is wrong with a fish.
You can ask, "Is this fish eating?
", and the answer will always be yes, but I have found that it is smarter to ask if they'll toss some food in, so that I can gauge for myself.
The only other drawback, is that this store is very expensive, where the same products and livestock at the other store I frequent (review to come) are MUCH more reasonable, but I weigh that against the 25min drive, and this store usually wins out as a matter of convenience.
So in short, this can be a great place to buy salt water fish, but do your own homework, and observe and assess the fish yourself (perhaps over a week or 10 days) rather than taking their word for it.

I will say this place is a little over rated but it is pretty cool.
I have a deep love for aquatic animals and have been searching for a place that can cater to what I use to be able to frequent from my home town in CA, Trop Aquarium comes close to the types of stores back in the Bay Area but I'm not impressed with there pricing and service.
They have a good selection of fish from Salt Water to fresh (as far as Vegas Stores goes) and there store layout although could be better is unique in its own way.
I would like to see it have more room in between isle ways as it becomes hard to get a good look around when there are more than 4 people in the same area.
But I'm not going to mark them down on this as for the size of the place it works just fine!
What I'm really  not impressed by is there pricing.
I have a lot of experience in buying aquatic animals and  for the past 10 years I have seen high and low and well regular priced fish.
Trop- Aquarium is on the extreme high side.
After walking around there store and checking everything out from the top tanks to the bottom tanks I could not believe my eyes on how much they are charging for fish.
Some of them are double if not triple what Petco charge (not that I'm a fan of Petco fish) but that's pretty ridiculous if you ask me!
So aside there over priced fish and decor I was thinking maybe they charge extra because they hire the best employees.
HAHAHA yeah I was wrong.
I was there for over 20 min before I was even greeted or even acknowledged that I was in there store.
Let me clarify that there were about 6 people there that were shopping and about 4 employees.
Give or take and 3 of them hung out behind the counter and the other was helping someone.
I couldn't tell if the other 6 people in the store were just hanging out or working or shopping.
Anyway the service sucked they don't know how to look up from there Iphone and say hi how can I help you or stop there discussion about each of there plans for the weekend.
Maybe I just came in at the wrong time!!!!
Trop-Aquarium has so far had the best selection in Vegas and even at that it could be so much better.
I will stay with 3 stars since this is so far the best Vegas has had to offer for aquatic hobbyist.

Very large selection of both salt and fresh water fish, but overall store appearance is poor.
As others have already stated lots of dead fish and the tanks are dirty.
Staff was very nice, but I would not buy any animals from these guys.

Trop-Aquarium has a wonderful selection of fish and they are very reasonably priced BUT good luck getting an employee in this store to even acknowledge you exist much less help you purchase some fish.
WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!

Not normally on this side of town, but was in the area for a Yelp event so made it a point to get down here.
I would like to visit all the local fish stores to see what they have.
They're worth checking out I think.
The tanks are clean, colorful and the animals are healthy and didn't find dead ones.
While their aisles are a bit narrow, I still think this is one of the most attractive stores we've been to.
They have saltwater fish and some I've not seen elsewhere like baby shark eggs (trippy its breathing in the sac!
see the pic!
) but a wider selection of freshwater.
The only thing I was sad about was their betta cups are the smallest I've seen, barely enough space to turn, boo.
I just expect more out of independent stores treatment of a often abused fish species.
They carry some tanks here, nice selection and have some high end ones.
This is probably the better store in terms of decoration items.
They have a lot of various rock and such.
I was hoping to find more driftwood as I love wooded tanks, but this is the first place I've seen with a rock by weight area, and a large selection of lava rock quarrys.
They had a small selection of plants which were in their own separate tanks which is a huge plus.
A lot of places don't have enough plants.
The staff was pretty friendly and immediately asked if they can help us out.
I was able to find algae wafers here for my shrimp tank and biomax which I was not finding at chain stores.
Overall, I think this is a solid local fish store and will probably make the trek across town to get some stuff for a community planted tank.

Great place!
The staff is really knowledgable, and willing to help.
Clean tanks, great selection.
The staff is really friendly and great with kids too!
Be sure to check out Free Fish Tuesday (bogo)!

I've been going to Trop Aquarium, as Dan H said, since I was in middle school in the mid 80's.
I've always found the store to be clean and the staff to be friendly.
Yes, sometimes their prices can be on the high side - but having worked part time in a pet store in high school and still being friends with the owners even today, it's not easy for independent stores to compete with the big box stores.
So if you want to enjoy the variety and difference a good independent store like Trop-Aquarium can provide over the cookie-cutter offerings from the big box stores you should be willing to pay a bit more.
The fact that they have managed to survive as long as they have indicates they are doing something right.

I like this store.
They are knowledgable and friendly.

They actually allowed me to have some neon blue damsels as a trade for some fish that I took back being to aggressive to newcomers.
Most of the help are courteous and helpful when you can find them helping other customers.
Their prices high but not the highest I've seen.
Working in a fish tank all day getting asked dumb questions about fish would give anyone an attitude like the owner'Manager that looks at you like a dimwit when you ask him something.
I'm surprised they don't charge you per questions asked.
There is a fish store way out on West Pecos toward Centennial that charge about twice what this store does and then their arrogant about it.
This arrogant little B _ _ _ _ _ _ would sell a regular Picasso Trigger for over $40 which is robbery; I use to get those for $12; i told him something like that and he walked away no doubt thinking I was too cheap to be in his store.
Sure wish I was back in South San Francisco were I had access to wholesale fish at a huge marine fish warehouse.
I was buying alot of angles, butterflies for under $20.
Try that at any of the rippoff outlets in VEGAS.
