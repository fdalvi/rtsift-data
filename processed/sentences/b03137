Pre-K is more structured than our last one.
My daughter doesn't enjoy it as much but at least she learns a little and gets to interact with other kids.
The school itself is clean and the teachers are extremely nice.

My daughter loves going to preschool here.
It's very well organized, fun, and she has learned so much!
The staff is amazing.
I haven't met one person here who wasn't amazing, helpful and so caring.
We plan on staying at CGLS for the long haul!
GREAT place!!!!!!
