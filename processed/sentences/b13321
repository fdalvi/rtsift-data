Somebody tell me where I can get a decent haircut and good service.
Still looking and I have a lot of haircuts left in my life time.
I was passed over 3 times today after waiting for 45 minutes.
I finally got up and left.
Never returning to any supercuts ever again.
Don't waste your time or money at any of them!

Super rude!!
The guy who gave me a haircut, Philip, is definitely someone who shouldn't be in this line of business if he doesn't know how to be courteous to his customers.
He snapped at me (oh yes..he did) for taking an extra minute to explain what i wanted and said that I wasn't being clear.
And then later in the guise of making conversation he commented about a child who came in saying that that child sounded possessed!
I should have walked out.
I regret not having done that.
This is it for me..no more super cuts ..ever!
Done!

Been going to Phillip for the last 6 years (Previously at Great Clips) - great guy.
Have 3 friends that go to him as well.
Just took my 2 year old to Phillip and he likes him a lot.

What can I say it's a Supercuts.
Just don't get the big latino chic.
She has no idea how to cut hair.
Bad haircut once, shame on you.
Bad haircut twice, I'm an idiot.

I've gotten my haircut here over the years when I've lived in that Happy Valley area.
I've had it cut by Jennifer mostly and Philip a couple years back.
I've never had a problem with this Supercuts.
And, I'm extremely picky about my hair and paranoid of getting bad haircuts.
Prior to coming here, believe it or not, I went to Aveda salons so I was worried about them slaughtering my hair.
But, Jennifer and Philip always have done a great job and have been super friendly.
I'm not trying to discredit some of these reviews because we've all had our own experiences, but I find it really hard to believe that Philip was rude to anyone!
He's always super friendly to me and to everyone that I've seen him come into contact with in there.
I think you might need to give him another try if you had a bad experience because he's got a witty sense of humor from what I remember and I can't imagine he would intentionally be rude to anyone!
Just my .02 on that.

Me and my mother decided it was time for a haircut so we went here since it was close to our house and not too pricey.
I asked for just a trim and a lady barley cut half a centimeter oft ends.
My mother got a shampoo and whenever she would say something, they would talk to her as if she were retarded.
Not going here next time.
