Sunny is wonderful and fun!
She truly seeks the health and wellness of all who enter her center.

Owner Sunny Afra is a burst of healing sunshine!
Her beautiful center boasts a sprawling space, perfect for concerts, dance classes and performance events.
The surrounding smaller treatments rooms are used for yoga, bodywork, and intimate meditation groups.
Sunny's team is warm and helpful, and vibe is about community.
There are some great chanting and gong classes, as well as kirtan concerts.
You will love the down-to-earth warmth of this center, which also has programming for children and families!

Wow!
Such inspired studio!
I'm taking the guided meditation class with sunny.
Sunny is amazing!
When you just enter to the door you already feel the energy :-)
