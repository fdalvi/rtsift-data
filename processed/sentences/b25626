Just happened to notice this place as I was leaving the food court.
We did because we are going to try El Salvador food when we take our trip to California.
We have never had it before and we were curious.
Everything on the menu looks really good.
So we just decided to pick up a papusa.
These looked popular because I would u of see people ordering and walking away with several on plates.
The nice girl that works at the counter did tell us the popular papusa was the bean cheese and pork and of course I ordered 1 to go.
She was also nice enough to say that it takes 8 minutes to make I was totally fine with that.
Now to the papusa ...it's a delicious flattened circle of masa filled with beans cheese and pork fried and seasoned to perfection it is served with a side of slaw like salad.
I will give 4 stars now hopefully I can give 5 when I go back.
And you have guess a the food is authentic if you see people from the old school in groups lining up to eat there.

I love this place.
Go there a few times a month.
The mix papusa is the best.
The staff are always helpful and kind and I am so thankful I found this place.
My friend has gotten their beef and chicken soup as well.
She prefers the beef but they are such hot sellers you have to get there early in order to get it.

We Discovered this place by accident, when walking around the mall we got hungry of course!
But being tired of everything else we wanted to see if they sold PUPUSAS...which is my favorite Salvadorian Dish...and they do!
Delicious!!
i usually get "revuelta" ones and my Wife really likes the cheese ones...so now that we found this place we come here often...usually Sundays after church if we are in the mood for some really good pupusas.
The staff is really attentive and friendly, they give you this card that's sorta like a loyalty card...and stamp it every time you visit...by like the 9th visit you get a free meal...who wouldn't want a free meal!
