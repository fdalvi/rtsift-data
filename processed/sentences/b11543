Yo, just ask for the McGangbang.

I work in the immediate area of this McDonald's.
I use it regularly.
This McDonald's is incorporated in a Walmart super center.
After 11 a.m., it becomes a mad house.
And when the high school lets out in the afternoon, students flood the restaurant.
Long lines and waiting on a table are the result.
If you do not like crowds that include loud high school students, I recommend avoiding this McDonald's in the late morning to mid afternoon.
B.T.W., management has zero tolerance of rowdy behavior.
This McDonald's leans toward being a McDonald's Express.
So if you want an Egg McMuffin-not here.
With a location in a Walmart Super Center the Eastern Beltway Center, it has a high convenience factor.
When the restaurant is not congested, it is a comfortable restaurant to eat McDonald's or sip coffee.
I never got rushed.

I was checking out at Walmart and my two 10 year old daughter went here to ask for a small glass of water with no ice for their puppy and the girl told them that the McDonald was out of water and they could buy bottled water...
They dug some of their Allowance they are saving for girl scouts to get some water for their puppy.. Poor service and bad form McDonald's!!
I was furious when I got outside and heard this happened...
