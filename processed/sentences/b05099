Premier Sportscar Service is the best place for Porsche service anywhere in Las Vegas, if not in the entire country.
Kent Moore was the lead tech for the Petersen/White Lightning team, that won every major endurance sports car race.
His prices are more than reasonable, and you couldn't find a more honest mechanic that knows everything there is to know about Porsche cars, from Cayennes to GT3 4.0's.
Even if I was across the country, it would be worth it to ship my car here for any tuning, repair, maintenance, or adjustments.
Absolutely and highly recommend this shop!

Recently went to Premier Sportscar Service for a minor tire issue.
The scheduler went out of her way to handle my issue in a timely manner.
When I arrived at the shop,I was graciously greeted, and give a tour.
I was impressed by the extent of work being done here.
It was apparent that a high level of expertise was present, and mechanics with an attention to detail would perform my work.
If you have a Porsche and need repairs, or upgrades done, I would definitely consider Premier.
I will be back!

Premier Sportscar Serivce is the only place to take your late model Porsche.
They recently serviced my 911 Carerra 4.
Not only are they professional, but their prices are more than fair for what they provide: quality and attention to detail.
I hope other Porsche owners know that we have one of the best Porsche shops around right here in our backyard.
You won't find nicer people than Kent, Amy and Matt.
If you're looking for quality, honest service done right, this is the only place to take your P-car in my opinion.
