I took my 7 year old Bassett hound in because her left eye started going grey and after being mis treated by squaw peak animal hospital for a week with no results and being treated for the wrong diagnosis twice.
They were the nicest people.
They spent over an hour with my dog testing and checking her out.
She has glaucoma which I guess is common for Bassett hounds.
I won't lie, it is not cheap seeing a specialist for her eye but they really know what they are doing and it was worth every penny it it helps save her other eye from going blind.
So, Thank You to Eye Care for Animals you guys are great!!

My nine year old bird dog was going blind from cataracts.
When I first got the quote to remove the cataract I gulped but the results were excellent.
He can see and we can return to hiking together; our favorite thing to do.
This surgeon gave Henry his quality of life back and we are grateful.

Thank you to Dr. Barrett and to the entire staff of Eye Care for Animals for saving my dog's eye after an ulcer.
The receptionist, and all of the nurses were BEYOND extraordinary and I truly felt that they cared about my pup.
I never had to wait in the waiting room or in the exam room more than about 7 minutes, which is very appreciated due to my hectic work schedule.
After about a month of healing after surgery, my dog's eyesight has returned and his last stitch was removed today!!
I will never be able to thank this office enough and would recommend them for any eye care needs your pet may have.
They were amazing on all levels- primarily customer service, and quality.
Bravo for this facility.
