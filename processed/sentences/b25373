The customer service is absolutely awful.
The women working there are rude and are incredibly judgmental.
I will never buy anything from there because of this.

Clothes are super overpriced.
I could go to India and buy the same thing for one eighth of the price.
Trust me, I'm Indian.
The clothes are fine, but the owner/clerk is barely ever there.
Sad....

Went there today and the lady working there couldn't have been sweeter.
She's actually the reason I'm posting the review.
I was checking Yelp regarding which stores to go into, and I was going to skip this store because of the previous 2 reviews.
They must have had some personal issue with the store?
Because the young lady there really could not have been nicer.
She was trying to help me find a bathing suit cover-up.
And I'm not really a desirable customer; I have 2 little boys/monsters that style around in their little stroller leaving a trail of food crumbs and lemonade wherever we go, while fighting with each other and touching everything with their sticky little fingers just to irk me.
Anyways, she was very sweet about my uncouth little hellions.
The store had plenty of options, but not really what I was looking for.
Anyways thought she was perfectly cool, and the prices seemed cheap to me (around $35 for a cotton cover-up or dress).
You may be able to get stuff like that for much cheaper in India, but rent here for a retail store and all the other overhead is expensive.
Keep it in mind before criticizing a small biz.
