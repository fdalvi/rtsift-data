This is undoubtedly one of the most friendly butchers in Edinburgh.
The staff here are always very helpful and able to help you find what you want.
The prices are in line with what you would expect from a butchers so there's no surprises on that front.
In addition the quality is what you would expect at the prices given.
It's not a place to do cartwheels over, but it delivers value for money and sells good meat - what more do you really need?

If it's meat you wants, it's meat they gots.
PRICE: Very reasonable for a family butcher.
SERVICE: Excellent.
Cooking suggestions and ideal cuts are recommended on inquiry, and in a friendly manner.
QUALITY: From taste, excellent.
From looks, also terrific.
CHOICE: Plenty of different cuts and meats, and a few pies as well.
This butcher is excellent.
I usually find myself buying meat from the supermarket on the logic that it is cheaper.
Wrong.
For better quality cuts I would find myself paying either a fraction more than in a supermarket, or indeed less.
Coupled with the advantage of knowing where and when the meat has come from is a good mind-settler.
Then, of course, there is the advantage of the advice that the butcher himself has to offer.
This is one of the reasons that a butcher is always better than a generic meat counter in a Tescos.
I ask which cut would be best for a grill with saut√©ed potatoes and stir-fry veg and I receive top-notch advice.
I ask what would be the best way to cook a shoulder cut of beef and I am told in useful detail a few ways that would work best.
Perfect.
I agree that for those with a slight nervous disposition around raw meat would not find butchers an ideal way to buy (perhaps because it looks far too much like a real animal if it isn't sealed in plastic first) but I must insist that if buying meat, this is the best place to go.

Great meat and very friendly and helpful service.
