One of the objectives of the new CityCenter is to create "dynamic public spaces.
"  Crystals Place is a public art collection located on the main drive into CityCenter.
You'll find wonderful examples by Rodney Lough, Jr., Dale Chihuly in "the GALLERY," Richard MacDonald's Cirque du Soleil-based sculptures, and contemporary works in the CENTERpiece showcase.
These free galleries, in addition to the cool artwork you'll find on the grounds of the CityCenter by Maya Lin, Nancy Rubins and others, are intended to transform CityCenter into a cultural centerpiece for Las Vegas.

A string of galleries presenting really cool, expensive art.
The Chihulys were wonderful, but it was the Rodney Lough's wilderness photographs that really piqued our interest.
He uses a 8x10 camera.
It's HUGE.
But the prints produced with this camera are so realistic it looks like you're viewing the subject through a window.
Definitely recommend.

Friends will ask me, "So what do you like to do in Vegas, just gamble?
"  Crystals Place is an example of how Vegas has so much more to offer than gambling.
The Gallery:  You need to stop by just to take in awe the bronze works of Richard MacDonald scattered around.
Of course you will also find the glass works of Dale Chihuly and the breathtaking photography of Rodney Lough Jr.  Crystals also has high end shopping like Tiffany if that sort of thing floats your boat.
No charge to see the art!
Be sure to look around for all the art in City Center because it has a lot to offer.
