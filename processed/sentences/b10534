Lutece is a French institution.
They are famous in culinary lore for being the first to ever charging people $30 for dover sole.
At the time, it was considered a trash fish and was not prepared in any major restaurants.
Now, dover sole is THE thing to order in any french restaurant pretending to be fine dining.

Chef Keven Lee made this place the amazing establishment that it was.
