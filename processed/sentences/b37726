Clear and fast service which is imp for fast food joint

The friendliest service and the best and freshest tasting sub sandwhiches I ever had.
This place is better than Subway.
I will continue to come every time I'm in town.
Thank you so much!!

This Quiznos is one of a kind.
It seems to be a family owned and if so it's good to see the owners behind the counter working along with the staff actually making the sandwiches.
I've never had a bad experience.
My sandwiches are always good and because they seem to have a better selection of sauce they put on them and their chicken doesn't taste processed I'm more willing to step outside my box and try other sandwich selections.
The Caesar salad is amazing too.
It could stand up in a taste test next to one prepared by a fancy smancy restaurant any day!
When checking out they're always eager to give you coupons for savings on your next visit.
Definitely recommend this Quiznos if you're in the area.

Sometimes it isn't just about the good food.
The owners are always here and always super friendly.
Eat here.

I have been to this location several times and the owner has always been there -- greeting you as you walk in the door, asking how your day is going while the sandwich comes through the conveyor, ringing up the order, and sincerely thanking you for your business.
I decided I just had to compliment this business as it's top-notch all around with well-prepared food, fresh ingredients, and the friendliest service in a quick-casual restaurant I've come across.
I highly recommend this Quiznos and agree with a previous reviewer -- it IS one of a kind.
If you are anywhere near Flamingo & Maryland Pkwy you won't regret checking it out.

Business has closed down.
