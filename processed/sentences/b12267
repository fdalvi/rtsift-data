We decided to head over to the trendy new Pink Taco in Scottsdale to check it out this weekend.
I must admit that the decor is pretty creative and tacky but in a good way...i think.
It is definitely visually stimulating.
The salsas, especially the green salsa, were good.
However, they try to make a chip different and it did not work.
The chips are very thick and almost taste burnt.
Why change a good staple?
Just to be trendy and different, I suppose.
That works sometimes but not here.
The food is alright, but nothing special.
I preferred the enchiladas over the burrito, and the chicken over the carnitas.
The key to this restaurant is atmosphere and good drinks.
I don't think they hook you by serving stellar food.
So, enjoy a prickley pear margarita and you should be on your way to having a good time.

I love it simply because of the name.
I was totally bummed that they weren't going to name the new cardinal's stadium after it!

I agree with John about the stadium should have been named after pink taco... but the food did not do anythign for me... there is much better tex-mex in the valley... but if you want to people watch and drink... check it out...

Two and a half stars.
To begin, I know it's their 'signature dish,' but the name Pink Taco compels me to believe that Harry Morton is a total doucheburger.
Aside from that, the fact that he called it the "Best Mexican Food in the Metropolitan Area" is absolutely appalling.
Has he ever left that block and a half radius of Old Town Scottsdale besides to board a plane to LA?
Doubtful.
The food is average.
I appreciate that some of it is actually somewhat creative, with a good use of sauces and colorful presentation.
But, best Mexican in the metro area?
Please.

I visited Scottsdale in August, for the first time.
I was with my mom who lives in Boise.
We ate at Pink Taco, mostly because of the hype.
I had heard about it before we even planned on going.
My mom cracked the hell up when she figured out what the name meant.
Oh, mortifying.
Overall, we had a good experience there.
The servers were very pretty and very very friendly.
My mom loves to talk to people, and our waitress was extremely nice and took the time to chat with her.
The food was good.
I think it's a tad bit too pricey for what it is, but nothing worth complaining over.
I'm sure there's better, more-authentic mexican around every corner, but it was a fun experience.
I'll definitely visit the one in LA when it opens this year.

After everything I'd read, I was expecting to cozy up at the bar with the likes of David Spade and Jenna Jameson.
Instead, I ate alongside over-the-hill hipsters and tourists who'd likely read the same reviews I did.
Bummer.
The food alone sure wasn't worth a return trip.

Pink Taco has great ambience, and a cool vibe.
The menu consists of mainly bar food- comparable to upscale Chevy's maybe, you don't go here for the great food but the drinks are awesome- the Sangria was my drink of choice.
Fun place for happy hour or to people watch with your friends.

This place can be summed up in three sentences:  Has a pretty interesting crowd and it's a really fun Tuesday night hangout.
Has a truly intriguing interior.
TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, GOD AWFUL food.

The reason I give Pink Taco one star is because I haven't gotten a table there yet.
Last weekend some friends and I decided to check it out.
My boyfriend and I were pretty excited because we haven't had a chance to eat there yet, and we wanted to see if it lived up to the hype.
Much to our dismay because we were a group of six we were told we wouldn't get a table until 10 pm.
IT WAS 7:30!
Now I realize it was a Saturday night and Pink Taco is evidently still very popular, but that is just ridiculous!
Hopefully I can add on to this review in the future, but right now I'm no hurry to go back.

Does it shock you that this place blows?
Does it really?
Ok, let me back up, as I'm assuming that every reader is as horrified with pop culture and the way our world cultivates youth.
I for one am simply primed for vomiting when viewing the primordial meat markets the likes of Scottsdale clubs foster.
But this place really takes the cake.
I'm eccentric and irreverent when it comes to decor, so the overall appearance of the place (gawdy, mostly) doesn't bother me... at all.
It's really just the simple and complete brainlessness of the whole operation.
The food is mediocre and the margaritas are standard.
The waitstaff is commonly too busy posing and catching their reflections in the one of many shiny, distracting objects to provide any standard of service.
And the management, my, are they pretty!
Pretty useless!
But, I'll rip the term "doucheburger" right from Jake C. (that's awesome, by the way): this place is filled with 'em.
Whom I'll bet pair nicely with the allll the cougars.
(those two terms rhyme a little... try them together, I bet you'll like it.

Food is horrible!

Interior is something to behold, but it's not impressive enough to keep one coming back.
So, what about the drinks?
Sangria is okay; margaritas aren't anything to write home about.
So, what does this place offer?
It's certainly not the grub.
The salsa tastes like burnt rubber.
The namesake dish (pink taco) is a mess on a plate.
If you want to go to say you went - to say you had the pink taco - then go, but don't say I didn't warn ya.
This place epitomizes all that's wrong in the world, or atleast what's defunct about Scottsdale.
Flashy baubles, boobie bouncin' women, marked up mediocrity and the air of popularity that's so desired, service and quality are jeopardized.
Uhm, no thanks.

People don't usually come to this downtown Scottsdale night spot to eat.
The food isn't anything to call home about and the margaritas aren't spectacular.
Infact, the bartenders tend to pour them weak.
However, you will find the party people at the PT.
They come to see-and-be-seen.
And the bar is SLAMMED with them on Tuesday nights when promoter Brian Durkee hosts Twisted Tuesdays.
You'll find guys with popped collars wearing sunglasses at night and peroxide blondes with stiletto heels and cleavage-baring tops.
If you're into a scene, this is probably the place for you.

I've had two experiences here - one pretty good and one not so good.
My husband and I ate here when we were apartment hunting, and maybe we were just famished from all of the running around, but we thought the food and margaritas were good.
The service was quick (almost scarily so, as in "how the hell could you have cooked that meal so fast?
"), but we were starving and dug in.
We enjoyed ourselves, although we did lament the $80 bill (we each had a margarita).
The second time we went was a Friday night with a group of people, and based on that experience, I wouldn't go back I don't think.
The waitress was clueless, and some Texas friends asked if they could make a michilada (spelling?
) and the bar claimed they could.
Well, it was not right whatsoever (come on, don't pretend to be skilled at making a drink you've never heard of before)...and then the food was mediocre.
The atmosphere has such potential, but the food (especially at the price point) disappoints.
The salsa is okay, though, but I can buy that at the grocery store, thank you very much.
Furthermore, I don't know if they actually put alcohol in their margaritas - slight detail.
To add to the classy experience, we sat next to a two person bachelorette party that was rolling dirty dice....is two people enough to even have a bachelorette party?
I digress.

Come to Pink Taco on Tuesday nights between 10pm and 2am.
And never at any other time.
Dont eat, just get hammered off of $3.00 3 Olives drinks.
Bring a large group of people and only talk to them.
Follow my simple instructions and you will love this bar!
Apparently I should have written this memo earlier, since then you would have been spared the miserable experience of eating at PT, standing in line at PT, breaking your bank at PT, or meeting assclowns at PT.
Thats really all I have to say.
The bar is fun when youre drunk and can stumble around, dance and hang out with your friends.
Perfect for the birthday party I was at a few Tuesdays ago.
Other than that, the food sucks, the people are idiots and the drinks are weak.
Ya dig?

Come on!
It's a chain...let's not take it too serious.
We had lunch on Sunday and I thought it was good.
The decorations are pretty close to looking like the House of Blues, but still had my attention.
There wasn't a wait, but I've seen the place prettty busy for cocktails.
We started with freshly made guacamole and it was good.
It had a little kick and still was chunky and full of flavor.
I ordered the combination taco plate and tried the following: - chicken taco- grilled chicken with everything, very good!
- carne asada- also totally good and full of flavor and not dry - carnitas- a little salty, I think I would pass on this one next time  Would I be back?
Possibly...it was good, not great- my tacos were fine, my ice tea was great!
Why not?
If it's not packed...give it a try.

I frickin' love this place.
I feel like everyone wants to hate this place and write about it's suckery and suckdom, but I have only had positive experiences here.
The food is pretty good - I've had the nachos, tacos, enchiladas and some random salad and all were good.
Not excellent - but very good.
I also enjoy the margaritas here.
Love the decor.
Yeah - so a lot of douches hang out here.
So?
Just bring your own homies and it will be okay.

- 1 * because it's a CHAIN... How disappointing.
But, I have got to give this place/corporation high marks for the name.
Genuwine and ballsy.
And the "accessories" they sell advertising their very own Pink Taco are ingenious too.
So, we just had to have the pink tacos, 3 chix tacos, "TJ style" and they were pretty damn tasty.
The fact that the bartendress gave us our drinks free wasn't too shabby either... Maybe she saw us reading the "Lesbian Coming Out Manual" (last one off the shelf @ the Borders down the Street, see the separate review) and felt sorry for us?
It was a joke, really... She's straight.
I am not.
Go figure.

Mark this.
Yelp saves you time, money and time.
I said time twice cuz it saves you a lot of time...
Pink Taco is like this review (and reviewer): Bi-Polar.
Its both 4 stars and 1star.
Before venturing over to  the congestion of Scottsdale and Camelback, I got on the Yelp machine and read the reviews.
**  Yelp knowledge summed up: ** 1) don't go unless its 10pm on an effen Tues,  2) don't eat and  3) expect tourists  Goodness!
It was spot on!
**  Other things bigDucky.Yelp.com is adding:  ** a-) secret parking is down below b-) location has horrible feng shui (feng shui is translated to mean wind water and it has to do with furniture orientation) c-) the term berger-douche is high-larry-ass d-) there are a dozen things going on that gives it a TGIF feel mixed in with a little hooters waitress action.
e-) I love how the mayor of Scottsdale is ok with PT.
Just don't let it integrate into a Paradise Valley resort unless it is buried behind a curtain like burger joint http://www.yelp.com/biz/XxLGYdB0s8IkZ9QZtGKBZA f-) Businesses that are confusing tend to go under.
Then Pink Taco peeps would get pink slips :-I g-) Its right next to a borders books so study breaks at PinkTaco!
h-) It needs a g-spot where drinks are FREE if you sit there i-) It needs a place for all the tourists to take photos in a cut-out PinkTaco  ohhh!
:  I have your new slogan: "Pink Taco-Eating out has never been so hit or miss"  Yelpers nice job analyzing PT a half a dozen ways!
p.s.
If you wanna secret parking spot, park under the 7150 Bldng across the street p.p.s.
@James S: So, is that something that youre proud of or embarassed for...
It's not like you invented "Waffle-House-of-Pancake-F-Changs"

I was extremely leery about stepping in here especially after a brief look at the photos on their website, but it turned out to be alright.
Of course everything appears pink under the shade of light in here, but I have to admit that my pink corn tortilla shell was inexplicably pink as were the red onions that were ensconced within.
I was here relatively early on a weekday night, so the place wasn't too crowded, the few people that were in there were "interesting" to say the least!
Bonding with a new found group of girl friends over beers and margarita was more enjoyable than sampling the food here, though I did like their chips n salsa.
In the end, what I liked most was the locale - in the heart of the Fashionsquare district, that makes for a very pleasant walk around.
For me, neither the food nor the pink themed memorabilia is reason enough to remember this restaurant, so my opinion - skip it.

grrr can't recomend this place any more....  First 2 times I whent suprisingly good.
Chicken Quesedia...better than taco bell ok ambiance...  last to times.... DJ from LA ment  no room to eat or drink....fire mashall shut down packed....   and once had the pink tacos and wasn't as good as I remeber....  so a chain that doesn't have consistancy?
may be I was drinking more on the days the food was good?

I have avoided this place up until now because everyone I knew who had been said it was terrible.
I was somewhat amused by the name of the place, but I'm a believer in word of mouth - and the WOM of this place was dismal.
Tonight my dining companion and I were headed to Sauce and decided to try Pink Taco on a whim.
The place wasn't very packed - there were plenty of tables available at 7pm on a Friday, so we were seated right away.
The way the place is set up, we were seated right near the bar and our table was bar height.
This meant that we had to endure assholes squeezing past to go to the shitter and people leaving their drinks on our table or leaning on it.
It was pretty awful.
I understand they have a popular bar, but this is a restaurant too.
It would be a really easy fix to solve this problem.
On to the food... it was shit.
The dishes are somewhat inspired by mexican cuisine, but they are rather bland and kinda gross.
The burrito I had was horrible - dog food.
It smelled rank and I couldn't finish it.
The salad wasn't bad, but it was boring.
My girl got shrimp tacos and ended up feeling ill later in the night.
She wasn't at all impressed.
Drinks - I had a house margarita on rocks with salt.
It was pretty tasty, but lacked a fair amount of alcohol... plus, it has given me a headache - I'm blaming cheap tequilla.
My girl had a signature margarita - I tasted it and it was decent, but a little too sweet.
They had a 'wine tasting' of their own label wine as well.
They had a chardonnay and a pinot noir/chardonnay mix... we had a taste of the latter and it literally tasted like a mimosa made with rancid orange juice that was sopped up with a dirty dishrag and squeezed into the glass.
Everyone in the joint was either an old ugly dude or a high-school girl wearing big sister's clothes or gay couples.
This place is a joke.
I wouldn't come for the food, nor the atmosphere, nor the drinks.
I'm never going back.
On the upside, dinner was under 100 bucks and the hostess was cute.
Apart from that, this place needs to be stayed away from.

The only thing I can say about this place is that "it's better than Taco Bell".
Actually "It's Better Than Taco Bell" should be its slogan.
The first thing that should alert you is when the owner (25-year-old son of a Las Vegas casino mogul) says that "there's no good Mexican food in Phoenix".
I guess charging $10 for some Fritos dip and $25 more for some "better than Taco Bell" food is the way to go.
if you're a millionaire and don't care about your product.
I went here once to try it out, and two more times I was dragged with friends.
It got worse each time.
Really, it's not worth it.
There are other places to eat horrible food and be tragically hip in.
But, hey.
If you're holding your crisp 50-dollar-bill and can't decide between 40 tacos from Taco Bell or an incredibly lackluster meal surrounded by hipsters in an overrated restaurant... give it a shot.

GET IT?!?
IT'S A EUPHEMISM!!!!!!
*PINK*.
TACO.
teeeheeeee BRILLIANT!!
As subtle as a fart in a rose garden, there lies Pink Taco on Camelback in Scottsdale, the epitome of style (errr... can you call it "style"?
) over substance.
The food here is certainly nothing to write home about.
It's all pretty generic, middle-of-the road mass produced tasting Americanized Mexican food with overpriced theme-y drinks.
Oh, and guess what?
It's not cheap.
You're paying for the ambiance (which does include attractive waitresses.... hello, if you're reading this).
All in all, save your cash or go to Los Sombreros.
No hotties in tank tops, but much better food, unless you like overpriced mehworthy vaginal-themed AmeriMex.

Yah, the place is seriously called "Pink Taco.
" I don't know if there is some sexual connotation involved but I guess I have a perverted mind.
Anywho...this place is defintely not the best Mexican food I have ever had.
It probably isn't even in my top 10.
I got the fish tacos, and was very unsatisfied, the fish was rubbery and had very little flavor.
The location is nice for shopping, nice shops around the area and the service was friendly.
It seems like the happening spot, but we went in the middle of the day.
It's geared to a younger generation crowd, maybe in the mid 20's...but next time I am in Arizona, I definitely will not hit up this spot.

PINK TACO is amazingly, stupendously, brilliantly... AVERAGE!
Nothing remarkable about this place except the name.
Average food, average service, average crowd.
I wonder if their marketing department ever expected that they could over-hype something so much that it would just let people down.
I am yawning as I am writing this.

So So Mex food if not poor.
Expensive for what you get.
2 stars for fair to good cocktails.
Somewhat pretentious staff.
Been there twice, dead both nights.
Wouldn't serve me dinner one night when I stopped in at about 9:30 so I left (they were admittedly dead that night as well).

This is the first Pink Taco I ate at...before the one in Century City opened up.
I had...of course...the Pink Tacos :)  It is a dish with three little tacos with carnitas with marinated onions that are pink.
Food is all right...what do you expect, it's corporate food.
I had also had Pink Taco Margarita which was very refreshing after shopping  in the heat.
The atmosphere is cool: lucha libra posters and masks; low rider bikes.
This place should've opened in LA first.

I love the chicken enchiladas verde  LOVE  I thought I'd hate this place.
I wanted to hate this place.
But I've only ever ordered this dish, and i LOVE this dish.
I wish I lived closer to it actually.
I love it that much.
So if you love shredded chicken enchiladas swimming in tomatillo/sour cream/queso fresco, try this place!

So how many of you actually went in for dinner "hoping" for good food?
From the sounds of it, most of you were as closed-minded as the "Scottsdale trash" you protest to hate.
YET here you are, taking your business there anyway... if for nothing more than to write a nasty review about it.
Self-fulfilling prophecy?
And guess what, they still got your money.
I'll admit, the first time I ate there, I was underwhelmed by the food.
But in recent months, since they brought on a new menu, it's definitely on the up.
I am assigning three stars based on the tremendous improvement in my experience between the first time and the most recent visit.
The energy in the room is great.
I want to be friends with the entire staff.
The music is fun, and played at just the right volume.
In all, it's a pretty stellar ambiance.
Want it quieter?
Head to the patio!
And the food?
No, we're not talking Michelin-starred cuisine here, BUT it's inventive, well-executed, and down right tasty!
I am salivating thinking of the Mexican Turkey Chopped Salad right now.
May have to head over for lunch.
The pink tacos, their namesake, are incredible... though I hear they are different since the menu change, so I can't judge the previous incarnation.
They are perfect grilled chicken with just enough tangy contrast from pickled pink onions.
My girl loves the lobster enchiladas, but they are a bit rich for me.
Who else has lobster enchiladas, though?!
And the mushroom quesadillas nearly left me crying, especially with that smoky little pile of whatever they are served with.
Is that chipotle jam or something?
delicious.
Overall, it's going to be a great time if you are in the mood for relaxed, yummy fun.
Take off your pissy pants and head over to the Waterfront.
Otherwise, stay home and watch Bjork on dvd.

This place is a freakin' joke from the beginning.
Let me preface this review by saying we had a group of 5, and 4 of us had 2 drinks before our 5th got her mojito.
It seemed as if the bartenders were capable of doing a beer or margarita, but nothing even remotely complex (not that mojitos are really complex.
) The food was absurd, and a joke to call it "mexican.
" I was sick all night, as were two of the girls in the group, and one guy.
The service in the restaurant portion was the exact opposite of the bar, and was very precise, even though they were bringing out sizzling hot plates of death.
It's a fun place to go and have a drink before or after your dinner which hopefully is taking place elsewhere in Old Town.
It's also a fun atmosphere on Tuesday nights, when you see all walks of life.
I think if they changed the name to crappy taco, so as to lower my expectations, I might like the restaurant quite a bit.

There was nothing remarkable about this place.
We went on a Saturday night and it was DEAD.
We were running late so we called and asked if they could hold our reservations for 30 minutes.
The hostess said that they were packed and they could only hold it for 10 minutes.
We rushed from our hotel, only to find that the place was dead!
There was plenty of seating indoors and outdoors.
Our server was nice, but the service was slow.
The food was average.
From what I hear, the Pink Taco in LA is much better and tons of fun.

Great place for inbred morons to apply for a management job.
Since that's what they seem to staff.
Went there once.
Bottom 5 all-time for service.
Anywhere.
In the world.
100% mediocre food.
100% inbred manager.
There are better places to shop for meat, better places to eat Mexican and better places to hang with friends.
Don't say i didn't warn you.

I think this is where the ASU sorority b!tches go for employment when Christie's Cabaret isn't hiring.
The service isn't the worst I've had, but they aren't over-the-top friendly either.
The decor and atmosphere is very cool and I loved the vibe but the food tastes like taco bell.
Actually make that Filiberto's (Filisquirtos) because Taco Bell tastes pretty damn good after too many drinks.
I liked the house margarita a lot and a friend talked me into a watermelon margarita which was pretty good too but it wasn't blended too well (we were a group of 14 on a saturday so maybe they got busy and couldn't blend the margaritas...I don't know).
I'd go back for the house margaritas and an appetizer (chips and guacamole) but I don't think I'll eat dinner here again.
Try Barrio Cafe...that place freaking ROCKS!

it was oooo-kaaaaay.
the service was generally stinky and unsmiley.
the food was supah tasty but supah salty and all of the tortilla skins (both fried or steamed) were really thick.
the decor was a little eccentric for my tastes, with crosses on the bar, horns hanging from the ceiling, and goth black menus with pink writing.
but it had all of the right ingredients for a hump day meal out - cocktails, filling food, and air-conditioning - and for all those things, i am thankful!

I personally will never eat there again.
The chips are actually amazing though, I would eat those a lot if it didnt require me stpping foot in the ultimate bro/slut restaurant.
The food is gross, the tortillas are ok, I like the decor actually, but the employees are slutty (and by slutty I saw skirts soo short if they picked something off the floor you for sure would see vagina)  Apparently the uniform is jean skirts and heels.
This is the male glittery shirt wearing capitol of Scottsdale.
The food sucks, dont eat here!

Pink Taco is just mediocre.
Plain and simple.
I was at  the one in Vegas first and it was a pretty good time and the food was acceptable.
Contrary to what everyone else is saying I thought the service was fine.
Don't waste your time at Pink Taco.

Yeah - cool name but the place sucks.
The people that work there are ...
I won't even comment.
The place is just not good.
The food is NOT good, and they have non existent options for vegetarians.
They are overpriced.
The location is good, being that it is at the Scottsdale Waterfront, but they are located on Camelback Road and its hard to find parking.
Once you do, you have to walk a ways to get to Pink Taco.
The only good thing about this place is they have outdoor seating.
The downside to that is you have to look at and hear the Camelback Road traffic.
Go somewhere else if you want my opinion.

Ehh.
Gross.
Seriously, when a MEXICAN (if I dare call it that) place can't make a good taco or quesadilla why would you go back.
It's a shame too because their happy hour last until 8pm... but now you know why... the food is horriable.

i have not eaten here but fear not the place is closing and they are getting out..Harry doesn't know what he's doing and it shows by the reviews..the kid is no Peter hopefully he will continue to do what he does best which is nothing

This place is great - IF YOU LIKE TO BE IN A SNOBBY ENVIRONMENT!
There are not too many places that I've been to that are more hype than anything.
But this is one of them.
When you try to go to THE PINK TACO, it's impossible to find a parking space.
Once you make your way to the front, the hostess is always too busy texting her friends than interested in helping the customer!!
If you are lucky enough to find a seat at the bar, you better have a rolex watch on or you will not be served quickly.
Either that, or you better be a Hugh Heffner spouse.
I tried the burrito and was grossed out by how rubbery it was.

No one seems to like this place and now I know why.
Maybe I'm giving it 2 stars because I'm a fan of their sangria.
The chicken tacos are standard.
My sis had the chicken skewers appetizer and said they were pretty dry.
I was there for happy hour on a Friday night and it was pretty quiet.
Our bartender was nice but not super friendly.
Um, I think that was my last visit to Pink Taco.

Food is ok - nothing that knocks your socks off.
It is a place to be seen in the Scottsdale area.
If you want to enjoy dinner, there are many better places to dine in Scottsdale than there.

Ya know what, it didn't suck nearly as bad as I thought it was going to.
The service was really friendly and laid back..
I have to say that the server assistant was hot as hell and really flirty.. apparently Pink Taco wasn't on his mind.. maybe more like Pink Burrito..
I digress..   Chips and salsa were fantastic!
Served in a bucket, their piping hot and came with some very tasty salsas.. neither salsa was hot so we asked for something hotter.. she brought out habenero salsa which was very tasty but not that hot either..
I think my tolerance might be high for spicy..   Order quesadillas, chicken enchilads and the burrito mojado.. the quesadilla was fantastic, cheeselovers unite!
Their quesadillas are packed with a cheese blend and tons of it!
Served with guacamole, chile paste and sour cream so the mixing and matching options are great!
Burrito was humongous and filled with tender pork then covered in a nice smoky salsa, avocado and cheese.
Along side wasn't your typical rice and beans but a very refreshing mixed green salad.. no iceberg here, dandelion leaves instead.. dressed very well with a light vinaigrette, very nice!
The green chicken enchiladas were extremely tasty and get this, the chicken was fresh!
These were served with rice and beans.. the beans were decent enough, pretty run of the mill but the rice sucked.
Was either really old or really undercooked.. either way, suck.
All in all I was expecting far worse from The Pink Taco but was pleasantly surprised by how a-okay it really is.
Id certainly go back when I'm in the mood for some good chips and salsa.. oh yes, and they really cute busboy!

Pink Taco...the name itself has you asking questions, of is this a restaurant or a brothel of some sort, when you walk in and see the decor, of the Mexican low rider bicycle on the wall, and the crosses, you are still wondering if it is a restaurant or a brothel for a bit...and wondering what any of this has to do with pink tacos!!!
So moving on, we were greeted by a friendly girl named Sara who just also happened to be our server.
She did a fairly good job considering she seemed to have limited amount of stuff to work with, and we were there during happy hour....it was dead!
I was impressed by there happy hour prices, until I experienced some of their happy hour specials first hand, my friend got the nacho's, I personally could of made better nacho's at home, I mean these things really looked like they cost less then 5 dollars, the chips here are so salty I would need a gallon of water to eat the whole dish, the salsa seemed fairly good and fresh, and the shrimp tacos I had were not bad even though I did expect some larger portions for 13 bucks!
The drinks, back to Sara, so I asked her what they had on draft and she rattled off about 5 beers, none of which were really that impressive to me, so when I pick one out she comes back a bit later and says they are out, so I reluctantly get a margarita what my two friends were drinking that did not look that impressive.
I also asked for a water, which took Sara two more requests before she brought it.
I was right, they were not that strong and for 5 bucks I would expect a bigger glass, these things were weak, and for five bucks, I was like come on, I thought this place was a bit pricey my tab was like 25 bucks for two margaritas, and three tiny shrimp tacos, and some bad table chips....that I was assuming where free, but maybe not considering my tab.
In any event I was not impressed with the Pink Taco...I can also say that this location seemed a bit dirty, our menus look like they had been wiped down with a dirty rag.
I mean I guess I couldn't expect any better, I mean this place is better known for it's nightlife on a Friday or Saturday then its food.
I would suggest someplace else I was not satisfied with the food, this maybe a great meat market at night for pink tacos, but the food sucks!!

I would give this place a half star but that is not an option!
The food sucked~the service sucked~the place just sucks.....
I hate for this to be my first review but it was just that bad!!!

Hello, its called the Pink Taco!
Guaranteed to be just a name and not meant for any means of food quality.
Hello....anyone getting this pink taco!
Not tasty, no, no, no.
It would be better if they served sausages and named it slippery dicks!

Honestly, my experience at the Scottsdale location was mainly for drinks at the bar - which were quite strong!
So I won't complain.
Although, I do need food when having cocktails, so usually order the lobster enchilada (the portions I've had at the Vegas & Century City locations were fine).
Been there twice now when visiting Scottsdale, and while not as huge as the Century City location, it's not a bad place to hang for a while before moving on.
Take it with a grain of salt.

My husband and I walked into this place and the 3 girls that greeted us were trying, like, forever to figure out where to seat us.
I mean "Hello!
" the place is totally empty!!
I think a few of their noggins were kind of empty as well but - hey, who am I to judge!??
We finally get seated outside and there is like one other couple in this whole place.
They should rename it Not-soHappy Hour??
We ordered margaritas and they were okay.
Chips and salsa were ok too -- not hot and nothing extraordinary here.
We ordered an appetizer and the food was just really mediocre.
Folks -- save your hard earned money and go somewhere else, heck anywhere else.
The Pink Taco smells like TUNA!

AWESOME decor- serious effort has been put into this place!
The pink tacos were delicious.
Wait staff was so so.
It seems like the larger your group, the slower the staff is.
A con is that I'm ALWAYS cold when I'm in there.

About once a month I crave their chips/salsas, cheese quesadillas,  pink margaritas, along with their happy hour prices.
And I'm not even pregnant.
First off, you get two delicious salsas - one red, one green - with a big pail of tortilla chips.
The chips are usually warm and fresh upon arrival.
I'm a chips and salsa gal, so if I do Mexican, I make a mini feast out of that.
They have happy hour almost every day of week (including Sundays), that include half priced appetizers and certain drinks (like the yummy Pink Taco Margarita).
The quesadillas come with guac, sour cream and some kind of sweet brown paste which is delicious.
If I go during happy hour, my check with the quesadilla and margarita is around $10, which is fine by me.
The decor inside is pretty cool and they have an outdoor area that's great for people watching.
There are a couple things about this place that may fool people: the vaguely Hooters-esque vibe of the waitresses, the touristy area and the innuendo regarding the restaurant's name.
But at he end of a long work day where I'm craving Mexican on the way home, the food is good and the prices are low.
The service is decent too.
I've taken friends and family from out of town there who also approve.

Beautiful decor.
And thats it.
This place is absolutely worthless.
I thought the food was horrible; their "renditions" on classics like the chile relleno just ended up as awkward sloppy looking things on my place that just flat out sucked.
The waitress checked on us once maybe the whole night.
But, when I do finally get her to ask for some sour creme for the last 3 now bites of my meal, I get this HUGE glob and unknowingly get charged 2 bucks for it!!
For TWO PEOPLE - two entres, and two drinks nothing more - 80 BUCKS.
RIDICULOUS!
Will never go there again, would not recommend anyone going there ever or again, way too cool for school.

It's me again the girl with no picture but here comes the review anyway,,.I should have checked with my fellow yelpers but alas I did not.
My hubby and I stopped in Pink Taco on Saturday thinking it was a great place to grab and appetizer and a margarita and sit on the patio.
HUGE mistake...this place has to go down as having the absolute WORST service.
Our waitress looked like she had a REALLY rough night the night before and while friendly definetly was not quick on her toes and those nails....anyway besides the service (had to go to the hostess to get silverware and napkins).
We were served water...finally... in a really crusty glass....come on people how can you not notice these things....our margaritas tasted like coconut and I am pretty sure they left out the tequila but hey it was HH so you gotta save somewhere.
The queso dip was the oddest queso ever....I think they just pile a bunch of leftover whatever in it and then never asked if we needed more chips to go with it....I will however give thumbs up to the chicken skewers which were tasty and worth the five dollars.
It's too bad because the place has potential just lacking in the detail and execution.....

Wow.....there are some seriously less than glowing reviews here.
I'll go against the crowd on this one....
I thought the decor was incredible.
This is coming from someone who has Mexican blood flowing through his veins and who knows Mexican culture, art, etc.
The place is like a museum.
Whoever designed this place should get mad, mad props.
It's beautiful.
From the crosses, the paintings, Dia de los Muertos (Oaxacan art) stuff....go see for yourself.
We stopped for a quick bite here.
We ordered the vegetarian salad (served in a tostada) and nachos (w/o meat).
I thought the salad was actually fairly tasty.
It had a consortium of stuff (peppers, pinto beans, salad, etc)........I dunno, maybe I was really hungry.
The nachos--were not as good --but not all that bad.......
The service was standard.
I can see how some yelpers might construe it as horrible -- those beautiful waitresses do look like they have a bit of a tude.......  Anyways, go here for a drink to admire the decor.
It's awesome.

I can see where this place would be a turnoff to some people.
It looks like breeding ground for Juicy-clad, ugg-wearing teenage girls with its trendy Mexican decor, but I actually like it.
Our bill wasn't too bad, $40 for 3 people, and the shrimp salad I had was DELICIOUS.
There were some pears, avocado, glazed walnuts (I think), and BBQ coated shrimp among other ingredients.
SO GOOD!
I went during the middle of a weekday, so it was pretty quiet there, but the waitress sat another noisy party directly next to us when the entire patio was open.
That's so unprofessional.
Overall I would come back to this place.
