Wow--this place really is jiffy!
I got my smog check and renewed my registration for the DMV right there in 7 minutes--I clocked it!
Highly recommended!

This guy knowingly and skillfully scammed me out of $22 that i could not afford to lose - Avoid this place - THE END

Tech was incredibly friendly, took about 5 minutes while we chatted.
Did my reg for me!!!
No waiting in line at the DMV for me ever again (they charge a $10 fee which in my opinion is well worth avoiding 2-3 hours of monotony at any DMV office).

The service was fast and friendly.
It's just north of the Summerlin Parkway at Buffalo.
It's a little shack in the parking lit if the Lowes.
There's a little sign that says "If the service is good feel free to tip" And the guy does deserve a tip.
he has a great attitude about life.

Great service, fast & friendly!
I go there every year.
Got the $4 off AND was told they will accept other company's coupons, yay!

No nonsense kiosk.
Very professional, in and out in minutes.
Luckily for me it's down the street from where I live.
The techs are friendly yet professional like myself and others have stated earlier.
Love this place and wouldn't go anywhere else
