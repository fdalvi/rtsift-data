I always have a great experience at The Facial Studio.
Not only does Rochelle do amazing facials, but she also gave me alot of education about my skin.
Now I know what do to for my skin & it's never looked better.

For the BEST facial in town you Must go see Rochelle at the Facial Studio.
I used to go from spa to spa.Not anymore my skin has never been so great.She gives an unbelievable facial, hand,neck and head massage.
She uses the best professional products which a big plus in my book.

I have had a few facials from Rochelle when I visit AZ, and she does wonderful work.
I highly recommend her!
