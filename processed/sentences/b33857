Absolutely fantastic dining experience.
Food was so fresh, tasty and immaculately presented.
While the wine menu wasn't vastly extensive, each of the 3 bottles we got were very high quality and great vintages.
Staff very knowledgable with the menu and attentive in their service.
7/8 staff front of house for such a small restaurant ensures you are well looked after.
Booking is essential as we found it quite hard to get a decent time for a Sunday evening a few days prior.
Like previous reviewer I am in shock that there are hardly any reviews for this place, given it has been here for over 3 years.
