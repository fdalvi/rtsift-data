I had State Farm Ins for over 30 years.
When I moved to Arizona I continued to have State Farm Ins with Sam Winter in Ahwatukee AZ.
After 40 years of safe driving I was hit by an uninsured motorist, who was 100% at fault (my car was stopped).
Sam Winter never once initiated a phone call to me, never explained how a claim works, even though I asked him to and he said that would be a good idea, never once called to see how I was doing.
Equally impossible to work with are the staff who handle your claim.
I had over $35,000 in doctor bills.
State Farm would not give me money to pay the bills, claiming that they only write one check.
Eventually the hospital put a lien against me.
When pressed State Farm made a partial payment, after telling me that they never do that!
I dropped State Farm.
Does this sound like a good neighbor to you?
Took over 2 years to settle.

I have had Sam as an agent for a long time and have had the best service.
He is always there for me and my family and always knows exactly who you are and takes an interest in our personal lives.
I strongly recommend Sam and know that you will be happy with his service.

Been a customer of Sam Winter for over twenty years, had a few claims with cars and my house.
Sam is always very professional and I truley enjoy working with the ladies in the front office.
He handles my cars, home and life insurance.
You couldn't pick a better agent for your insurance.
