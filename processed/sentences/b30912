Kelly has been doing my hair for some time now.
I love her, and HIGHLY recommend her.
She really knows color and styling.
She asks what works for your lifestyle and time, and knows how to work w/ all types of hair.
She's 5 stars in my book

Kelly has been doing my hair for over 2 years.
She is an expert, and so much fun to talk to.
It's obvious that her goal is to make her clients look and feel their best.
She is very detailed, and she uses high-quality products to yield the best result.
I love the suite-style salon she works in too.
Kelly gives personalized, individual service to all her clients.
If you're looking for a new salon, call Kelly and make an appointment right away.

Kelly does an awesome job and is the funnest person to talk to :) She does some of my friends hair as well.
love her!
