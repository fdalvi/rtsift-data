At first, I was a little wary of the place because the exterior and interior look a little old, but after my cleaning, I'm really happy that I went here.
The dentist and staff were all very nice, I feel like my teeth are VERY clean after leaving, and they offer a substantial discount for ASU students and staff.
It was much better and much cheaper than any dentist I've been to since moving to Tempe.
Highly recommended!

I went to this dentist's yesterday and had several fillings on my teeth.
The whole process was comfortable and Dr. Acosta and his assistant were very nice and professional.
So I went back and had a cleaning today.
I like it because they do care about you, and they try their best to reduce your pain and worries.
I highly recommend this place.

Wow!
They're awesome here!
I felt so comfortable and at peace when I was in the office, the staff is super nice and friendly, which takes away from the nerves of going to the dentist.
I don't have health insurance which made me afraid to go to the dentist, but Dr. Acosta was really awesome and gave me a great deal just to help me out.
I found the dentist office that I will be going to for the rest of my time here in Arizona.
I would highly recommend this office!

Muy buen lugar.
Todos los trabajadores son muy amables, y el Doctor muy atento y honesto.
He estado buscando un dentista en el que pueda confiar y ahora le he encontrado.
Toda mi familia está muy feliz de ir a esta clínica dental y yo la recomiendo a quien sea.
