Very nice and clean.
At the top of every hour you have to get out!
This is awesome in my opinion reapply sunblock or go to the bathroom for kids!

I take my son here for swimming lessons.
If you are a Mesa resident then lessons are only $22 for 6 weeks!
The aquatic center is huge.
The lessons are held in the kid's pool area where the water slide is.
There's a really shallow play area too.
They also have a diving pool that is 13 feet deep and and olympic size pool for laps.
They have a grand stand for watching events and a picnic area and shaded areas for lounge chairs.
There is really something for everyone at this pool.

My daughter and I love this place.
She takes swim lessons there and the staff is so nice and encouraging to her.
I wish I could remember their names so I could call them out but Justin is the only one I remember.
He was super great but all of the others are, too.
It's clean and reasonably priced.
I just wish they had more sun chairs for the parents to use while the kids are having fun.
