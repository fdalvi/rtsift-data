Go here if your looking for really cheap shirts for men & blouses for women.
Had some not bad looking sweaters too but in the middle of summer me thinks not.
Love that there's a wide variety of solid colors but isn't it always the case you can never get the color you want in the size you want?
Guess that's part of the fun here.
Bought some $5 mens polo shirts for gifts and two shirts for me.
Paid $ 22.61 for four shirts.
Cheap.
Did not see any fitting rooms here but don't know for sure whether they had them or not.

Good quality clothes at bargain prices.
Enough said.

I have been in here several times.
I usually go in looking for one thing and they don't have exactly what I want but for some reason some other thing or things just reach out and jump into my arms I am the the new owner of "----".
Dirt cheap prices.
I think it is one of the better stores in the outlet center.
But then again I don't go looking for trendy stuff, which this store is heavy on the conservative side.

They have great prices, but I rarely find anything a want.
It's a great place to stock up on $6 tanks and t shirts though and sometimes you can find cool brands like American Eagle.
