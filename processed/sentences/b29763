They were great.
Very timely and very knowledgeable.

This was my 2nd time using this awesome and friendly clinic to get my shots before going overseas.
Eileen was referred to me by a friend.
I am so glad she did because Eileen is SO knowledgeable and she doesn't try to sell you or scare you into getting every shot under the moon.
She has a good sense of what is super necessary, what she might suggest as extra depending on different environments.
She is also able to prescribe my sleeping pills for my flights and my anti malaria meds which is great because that's one less appointment for me!
There are a few different types of anti malaria meds and she is helping me navigate that decision before I leave.
The office is insanely friendly and everyone working there is so awesome.
I just want to hang out with everyone!
Highly recommend.

Very helpful and knowledgeable!
Didn't feel a single of the 4 shots, Peru here we come!
