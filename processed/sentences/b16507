Not bad.
Small place with a good selection and tasty food.
Nice people, good price.

D:'  It most definitely wasn't really good, but there's something about MSG and Sodium saturated, super-Americanized, low quality Chinese food in a buffet setting for less than 10 bucks that just hits the spot.
Even though it had been over a year since my last visit, I can't lie, I am gonna miss the place a bit.
