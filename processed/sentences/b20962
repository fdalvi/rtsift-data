For an airport restaurant, this place is really quite good.
We had the "curry feast for two.
" For 15 pounds we had the Chicken Jalfrezi and the Lamb Rogan Josh - both were excellent.
The price also included two drinks, a pint of Fosters and a glass of wine.
Oh, yes, and some poppadums were included, along with some naan and chutney.
A real treat and not a bad bargain to boot.

Probably the best airport restaurant/pub I've been to in ages.
Typical 'Spoons fare, but price-adjusted for the airport set.
Still, quite reasonable.
Good food, cold drinks, pleasant service.
While waiting for a flight, I couldn't ask for better.
