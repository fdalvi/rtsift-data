Thanks to the Team at Preferred PR for the help they gave me with our Vegas Young Professionals Anniversary Mixer.
They did a great job!
They helped with everything from connecting us to the venue, assisted with check-ins, and mingling to make sure everyone was having a great time (which they were!).
It was a first class event and will be one to remember!
Thank you to Michele, Jen and everyone else on the team who put in their time and effort to make our Vegas Young Professionals Anniversary a success!

Preferred PR has delivered GREAT results for our Twitter presence in Las Vegas (@MortonsLasVegas).
They are very knowledgeable about delivering results in social media and creating a great following.
If you want results and want to work with great people to exceed your social media goals, Preferred PR certainly is that.

I have been covering and photographing events in Vegas since 1996 and I am always blown away by the turnouts at Preferred PR events.
Their openings always have a very high attendance rate and tons of media show up.
They know how to get the word out to everyone and spark interest.
I am really impressed with how the team works together and can make a multi faceted complex event run smoothly while ensuring their client, the media attending & the guests are all taken care of.
