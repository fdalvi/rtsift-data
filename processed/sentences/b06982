Dayjobbers rejoice!
Here is a place where you can sit down and have healthy, fast, vegetarian/vegan food and make it back to work in time for the rest of the daily grind.
For those who must have their meat, they serve a limited selection of meat dishes.
The majority of the food has a Mediterranean influence.
There are unique daily specials.
You can order from the menu where one can get their falaffel (or burger) on.
It does get busy and crowded during lunch but there usually is ample seating room and turn over, since the downtown/campus dayjobbers (who mostly frequent this establishment around the lunchtime)  have to make it back quickly.
As far as I know Caspian Cafe is only open until 5p or 6p on weekdays, so make it for lunch or an early dinner.

Uneven hummus but consistently tasty yogurt sauce and DELICIOUS fresh-baked bread (that, I have noticed, they tend to run out of toward the end of the day -- so be quick with it!

Now here's the type of restaurant I don't get in Valley City!
The Caspian Cafe's specialty is Persian, and it's very interesting to try.
It's not my favorite, given that there's quite a bit of cheese on several of the menu items, but not on everything.
The soups are pretty good, and their specialty items are what I would recommend the most.
Oh yeah, I tried tabouli for the first time here, before I really knew that I loved it, so I definitely want to come back just for that.

After a very disappointed experience at Mediterranean Cafe on state, my hope of savoring a good Mediterranean food was thinning down.
But Caspian saved me.
For dinner, I ordered Falafel sandwich, which came with tabbouleh salad with thick creamy yogurt sauce.
The tabbouleh salad was so good by itself, but the yogurt sauce definitely sealed the deal.
Delicious.
The sandwich was served on their homemade bread.
This was very good as well.
I'd like to go back for lunch and try other items on the menu.
