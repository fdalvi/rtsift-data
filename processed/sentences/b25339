This camp is fabulous.
Run by Karyn Miller, the principal of Fountain Hills Charter School, this camp is as good as day camps get.
Karyn's exuberance and love for working with children comes through in every aspect of this camp.
She hand picks counselors who share her enthusiasm, making for a positive environment filled with fun activities (arts and crafts, archery, sports, water play, and a host of other creative activities), friendship, and happy children.
My son comes home from his day tired and happy.
He's graduated to Camper Leader this year and is loving it!
What a gem to have here in Fountain Hills.
(She sends vans to pick up in Scottsdale too!

After looking at their material and speaking to the people I would never trust these people to care for my child  They care more for themselves then the children

Bad service.
Spoke with the person that runs the place and got hung up on.
Will never deal with them again.
