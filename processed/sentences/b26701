The tellers and bankers at this location are friendly and helpful.
English Is not my dad's first language.
He sometimes has difficulties with understand all the jargon and technical terms.
The personal banker was willing to answer all his questions and walk him through the paperwork.

Definitely a standard B of A location.
I do not bank with them personally, but I come to this branch pretty often to conduct transactions.
The service could be friendlier and more efficient.
I encounter quiet a few sourpusses among the tellers and they have messed up transactions in the past for which I had to return to fix, which was inconvenient.
I'll still probably come here since it's conveniently located.

What can i say...its a bank.
I like BofA because of it's ease of access.
I can find one everywhere.
People are always freindly and they give me my money when I need it.

Can't really say much accept I needed a Bank of America ATM and this branch was close when I needed it.
There was no one using the ATM outside so it was a quick stop.
