Besides the fact that the restaurant looks like the inside of my culo the wings are exceptional.

For those that miss this great wing spot.
They have moved to 1449 E. Main st.
They are in the old capt.
D's.
The menu is the same!
Food is just as awesome.
Restaurant is much cleaner and they have a galaga machine, can't go wrong with that.

DELICIOUS wings!!!
They are quick too.
My only complaint is every now and then there is a baby wing and it's counted as one of the dozen.

Fantastic wings.
I love a good chicken wing and for years I've been going to the Native New Yorker and other neighborhood bars.
Time and again their wings are not consistent and they have gotten smaller while the price goes up.
Wings Express are always fresh, crispy and the sauce is outstanding.
I have been here about a dozen times now and the wings have always been awesome.
I wish they would open a location in the area with a sports bar.
They would give Native a serious run for their money.

I eat at this place maybe 2-3 a week!
I am die hard wing fan and these are the best i have had ever!!!
They are crispy, flavorful and warm all the time!
Best part is they charge by the pound not per wing!
So for a  great wing and a great price try wings express!

My fav place for wings!
No other palce can do Honey Hot like they do!
They are nice and crispy and juicy!
It may sound odd, but they have the best egg rolls, you are missing out if you have yet to try them!

This place has really good wings and carrots ranch is good too.
Potatoes   Skins are a hit or miss there either really good or I ordered them in the past and there rock solid.
Cheese sticks are ok and fried zucchini are really good.
Not bad for frozen products!
But there wings are good!
Restaurant: Never ate there.
I always get take out.
The deco is corny really strong wing sauce smell.
It's a wing place what expect!!!!
Staff: It's a hit or miss!
