Stephine's, where do i even start!
I was totally flipping out because i forgot to buy a baby shower present and friend told me to go check out the kids store on Indian School and Goldwater.
Let me just say that the girls there were soo  helpful!
After running through my prob-lem-o and about home much i wanted to spend, they showed me a few items and i picked out the cutest    ASU burp cloth.
ADORABLE.
quick ez to shop, lots of help if you need it over all a fun place to go to in a pinch!

There's no other boutique quite like Stephanie's in town.
If you're looking for that personalized, one of a kind attention this is the place to go.
The staff is fantastic at assisting in outfit ideas, gift ideas and even home decor and design.
It's truly an upscale "lifestyle" boutique that makes you feel like you could be shopping in Paris, Milan, NYC or LA yet it's right here in the heart of Scottsdale.

NYC style right in Scottsdale.
Love the high end, hard to find designer pieces and the brands are amazing.
The staff is very helpful in putting together looks.

This is the only boutique of its kind in Arizona.
I just got back from New York and this boutique would fit right in there.
I am never disappointed and never leave empty handed.
Amazing clothes that you don't find anywhere else.
I love unique jewelry and accessories.
You can even find the best one of a kind gifts.
I can't say enough about Stephanies.
