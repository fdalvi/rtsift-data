Great service.
Extremely knowledgeable.
Eugene was great!

If one is in need of anything Montblanc this is THE store to which you need to pay a visit.
I emphasize the word because this particular location is that good.
On the occasion of my visit I was fortunate to have Julie Y. approach, greet and later proceed to demonstrate for me Montblanc's Oyster Grey ink.
She would also produce and show to my fiance a Princess Grace fountain pen.
Julie is an All-Star and the store is spacious with a large selection of merchandise.
I concur with a statement from the 4/4/2013 review, "...shop at Montblanc!
