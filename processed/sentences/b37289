Burlington Coat Factory is now open in the Arcadia area and just in time for the  holidays!
It boasts all the usual BCF offerings like clothing, shoes, home goods/decor and baby gear.
The store is clean and bright --- for now.
I hope this location is able to maintain a clean, neat environment which is lacking in some of their other locations.

I guess I'm accustomed to the very large Burlington in Vegas.
This location had a very small selection of suits.
Overall, the store felt very small to me.
The Vegas store is at least 3 times larger than this one and I left disappointed.
I was able to find a few dress shirts, but left empty handed without a suit or tie.
On the plus side, this store was very well kept and clean.
Return Factor - 50%

It's not fancy.
But when it's 12/24 and you are running low on stocking stuffers, this is the place to be.
Before they opened I would run to that fiasco of a Marshalls on 20th & Camelback (Parking hell!).
I'm happy Burlington is in Arcadia now because they have a full stock of the different sorts of Jelly Bellys and whatever odd-sort candies and jerky I like to stuff stockings with.
This year, I bought a bag of bacon jerky.
It was kinda gross, but it was definitely worth trying.
I also ended up with a beautiful wool coat, some dress shirts for the hubby and my dad, and a few cute knickknacks for mom.
The cashier was super nice too.
I love that I didn't have to spend 40 minutes looking for a parking spot, I ran in and ran back out within 30 minutes.
That's efficient shopping!

This Burlington coat factory really irks me.
I have come here with my boyfriend on multiple occasions to purchase lots of clothes and shoes.
Their customer service here is the worst I have ever encountered.
So bad that I have had to call the manager to complain.
If you need to return something the "manager" Danny will pick at your item like its a piece of garbage and point out its imperfections that he assumes you caused before he will accept your return.
Why not just make everything final sale instead of making a simple return something bigger than it really needs to be.
Although I don't really care for Burlington coat factory I would recommend going to the new location on indian bend.
That store is immaculate and the employees have their shit together.
