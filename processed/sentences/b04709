Good place to grubb for lunch

OK I hear people say Quiznos is better than Subway.
Now that I think about it, jeez if Subway is the comparison  what the hell am i thinking.
Anyway, Quiznos sucked.
Food quality is betwwen Eek and uggh.
Service was slooooooooow.
Taste was bad...to really bad.
Frst and last time.

Fire Doug!
I have been here twice and the service is incredibly slow.
You cannot get a hot sub because Doug takes f o r e v e r. I waited 20 minutes for two subs today.
TWENTY MINUTES!
The food is good (if you like cold subs) and the place is clean but I will not be returning.
