It is so hard to find someone you can trust with your hair, but look no further.
Chelsea takes the time to go above and beyond on my hair everytime.
She wants everything perfect and her hi/low lighting has been among the best I have had done.
She listens to what my vision is, gives her professional advice, and I am always happy.
I highly suggest her for anyone who is looking for someone who is an expert with color.

Where do I begin?!
I was able to stumble upon Chelsea after moving to Arizona.
We all know how scary it is to move to a new place and leave an amazing hair stylist behind.
Well Chelsea has replaced that hair void in my life!
I cannot say enough great things about her and the work that she does.
I truly enjoying my appointments and look forward to the time that I get to spend with her.
I highly recommend Chelsea!

Chelsea is my go-to girl for all things hair.
I recommend her to anyone who asks and everyone I send her way always loves her.
He listens if you know what you like, or she offers suggestions if you want help.
She makes sure my cut, color and style are perfect and recently my ombr√© color had gotten more compliments than I can count.
I have long hair and she always knows exactly what to do with it.
We are to the point now that I just sit down in her chair and let her go!
She is also a joy to be around and that always makes it better.
Make an appointment, you will not regret it!

I have been getting my hair done by Chelsea for multiple years now and I couldn't be happier about my hair.
She literally does everything!
She has done my extensions, my color and my cut and she's done one of my best friends' weddings and their hair was STUNNING!!
She is such an experienced stylists and truly loves what she does.
I love coming to see her because she is so genuine and sweet and you know she wants the best for your hair as well.
I HIGHLY recommend seeing Chelsea!
She's awesome!
