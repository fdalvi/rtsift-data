Lucy is a talented artist/painter - I have seen her paint portraits you would swear are photos, and murals so realistic its like looking through a window.
IF you have an artistic painting project you need to consult Lucy first - from clouds on the ceiling, to a mural in your restaurant, or a portrait of you and your classic car.
Lucy is fun to work with and very reasonable for her advanced level of artistic talent.

Lucretia Torva has a brilliant eye for realistic detail and the talent to pull off the fantastic as well.
Her artwork ranges from the beautiful to the whimsical to the sobering, but is always exquisite.
She is both highly talented and deeply skilled and so I recommend her and her work unreservedly.

Pretty sure I saw an ad for her whoring out of Phoenix on backpage lol.
Guess the art business isn't doing so well
