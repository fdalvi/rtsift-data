What can you say about Panda Express Fast Food?----It's fast and that's it.
Nothing to get your palate all excited about or go out of your way for...It is just plain ol' sustenance at a glance.
Put your money down and they stuff you.
Now move it!
Pros about this franchise: It's fast!--- Cons about this franchise: It's fast!---  As they would say in older Taco Belch commercials----"Want Some?

This is located in the local area mall.
Only had a few people in front of me in line and it was moving incredibily slow.
Overall food was good.
How could you go wrong with Orange Chicken?

All I wanted were some deep-fried foods.
Spring rolls, crab rangoon, maybe some rice to go with.
The rangoon might have been passable even without crab, but it was soggy along the bottom.
The spring rolls were crisp, but I don't think I even have words for what was wrong with the flavor.
Never again.
