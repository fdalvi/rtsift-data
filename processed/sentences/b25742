SUPER expensive!
I dropped off 9 garments for same day service, they don't have set prices per garment so i didn't get a price at the time of drop off.
How much could it be?
Came back later that day to pick up and was charged $125!!!
For 9 things, thats ridiculous, especially considering there are cleaners that will charge less than $3 per garment.

Fast same day service, always great customer care and they always remember the small details.

By far, one of the most overpriced places in town.
I am not making any negative comments about their work, which may be terrific.
But so far overpriced, it doesn't matter.
