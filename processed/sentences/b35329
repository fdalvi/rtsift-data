I stop at this location after work sometimes and I find it to be very convenient with drive up banking!
I can do standard banking and choose if I want to use the drive up ATM (can use ATM anytime of day) or drive up to a actual teller (during normal business hours) and then you can of course always just go inside.
The lines aren't normally long and the tellers are friendly.
Figuring out how to get into the parking lot was I have to admit odd for me.
When you pull in where I did, you have to drive up and around to get to the bank.
I wasn't sure I was in the right spot.
It looks like they have more building maybe to do and it will be more complete at a later date.

I opened an account at this branch when we originally moved here because there were no branches of my bank in Nevada.
The banker who helped us was very nice and friendly.
Great customer service.
He even gave me a free stuffed Chase dog haha.
They had a promotion where they'd give $125 after the first direct deposit to anyone opening a new Chase checking.
I'd had a promotion like this before with my previous bank and it took forever for them to deposit the reward.
Holy smokes, after my first direct deposit I had the $125 in like 2 days from Chase!
This branch has drive up banking, which is very convenient, and everyone is always very friendly and helpful.
Totally loving Chase and this location so far!

Branch is great, new, and not too busy.
Bankers are knowledgable.
Lorraine was EXTREMELY helpful, very nice, and had a sense of urgency in assisting customers

Chase Bank surpasses any and  every other bank that is standing to date.
This Bank has many more options as a customer than any Bank I have been a part of.
Kudos Chase Bank!
