Not sure why nobody has reviewed this gem yet.
It's a madatory stop each time I'm in Vegas on business.
Whether it's a Chanel suit, an Escada blouse or something from St. John you seek, you'll always find something to bring home with you.
This time I was rewarded with an almost new pair of Ferragamo sandals for $50!!
The location is crappy and don't let the pink paint or the bars on the windows (yes I said bars) scare you away.
Guaranteed you will find something to covet here.
Well worth the cab fare over.

Las Vegas is one my favorite place for shopping and this is one of the best consignment store I've been to.
The location is far from ideal as the owner will tell you, but the minute you walk in you will be offered something to drink and maybe something to munch on as well.
The selection is decent and the prices are very low.
I recently bought a Chloe skirt for $13 and a red Prada silk dress for $50, both of which looked new.
The owner even asked if there was anything else I want and if it was too much money, she'll see what kind of discount she could give me in addition.
This is what consignment shopping is meant to be.

Closed on a Friday at 1pm?
No!
It can't be..
I saw a gated door that was locked, so I rang the doorbell with excitement.
I wanted to see what this place has to offer.. who knows, maybe I'll find a hidden gem!
It's been a minute and no answer.
Maybe it's one of those buzzer doors that allow only one customer at a time, you know, the kind of doors they have at the asian jewelry stores?
So I keep on ringing the door bell and I'm in denial.
I don't want to believe it, but I think they're permanently closed :(  Got my hopes up for nothing, pffft  And the other reviewers were right.. the bars on the window were a bit off putting.
Good thing I decided to roll up during the day time.. lol
