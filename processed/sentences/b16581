Pretty small, but the people are nice

I really enjoy shopping at the pawn shops in Vegas.
There's always a good selection of products.
This location has a nice selection of jewelry and watches.
On a recent visit, I found a ring for The Better Half.
I bought it at a great price and squirreled it away for a future gift.
The Superpawn stores in Vegas are willing to deal with you.
I offered 30% less than their asking price (not sticker price) and got it....I probably should've asked for more, but once they agree it's hard to go less than that.
Return Factor - 80%

Wow.
Called to check on pawn for a friend.
Put on hold twice for a ridiculous amount of time, almost comical til they hung up on me and I had to call back.
No apology...nothing.
Just put on hold...yet again.
Infuriating.
Totally rude & not helpful AT ALL.
Thanks for the help sweet girls at Super Pawn.
