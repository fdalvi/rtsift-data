Prices were great and the place clean but the bartender was rude, trashy and made the experience miserable.
If Pfoxy Roxi is the best you can do there is no wonder why the place is slow.
What a waste of time and money!

Great drinks and prices.
Very comfortable place to hang out.

Went here with friends has so much fun..roxy is a great bartender..my friends are regulars, and was surprised how much i enjoyed myself.
Will definitely come back..this is a nice chill bar.
