Great place to take your devices to get repaired for fast quality work.
(2 hrs) Very friendly and cannot beat the price.
Thanks Hunter.

Hunter came to my home and repaired my iphone and made it work better then when I handed it to him.
Hunter was on time, super friendly and very knowledgable.
Don't go anywhere else to get your apple gadgets repaired...... icracked rocks!

Hunter met me after I installed a new screen, but wasn't seeing anything on my phone.
He was quick to respond to my inquiry, met me on time, explained everything, was very friendly... And best of all he fixes my phone.
I truly appreciate the high quality service!
