3 1/2 stars  After enjoying a happy hour at Ra Sushi in Scottsdale, I decided I needed to see some ladies...preferably stradling a stage or pole to heavy metal or rap.
I got my wish here!
A ten buck cover charge led us to comfortable seating by the stage, complete with a clean ashtry and a 2-4-1 drink well special that was awesome-the G&Ts were a bit TOO strong.
They supplied matches, the waitresses were professional and competenat, the ladies not too pushy and most of the ladies on stage wore great lil outfits, knew how to stradle a pole or grind a floor with a mirror behind them.
However, a strip club is only as good as their clients-and the rowdy ones would come and go as the night waned on.
A good time, open to ladies perusing the joint, cheap strong drinks and smoking indoors and comfy seats-just needs to get a lil more hoppin...

Very classy place with attractive talent - many girl-next-door types.
Drinks and lap dances reasonably priced.
Highly recommended and would go there again.
They run a lot of 2 for 1 drink and dance specials.
Top notch.

Do not go here.
Big rip=off.
