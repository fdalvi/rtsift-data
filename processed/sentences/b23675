Looove all they are about !!!
Awesome concept.
Keep the great work !!

LOVE Hope's Closet!
Have donated to their cause several times, and will continue to.
Also, fantastic place to shop.
The clerks are all so nice.
They did move not too long ago, and are now located next to the Big Lots on Litchfield Road @ Van Buren.
Much bigger location.
