all you can eat sushi- good deal.
all you can drink - great deal.
sit at the sushi bar and do both.
not melt in your mouth sushi, but good for the mouth....

I went here last nite after a long day of site seeing in the Valley of Fire National Park and we were very hungry.
So this place fit our hunger very well.
We started with the Miso soup which was yummy.
Good way to start out our early dinner since hiking on the trails tired us out.
We then got a variety of rolls and some side dishes....Everything was tasty but I was disappointed in the presentation of the rolls.
They broke apart easily and were not consistent in size.
We definitely got our moneys worth leaving really full.
I'd go back if I was in the mood for trying a variety of sushi.
My favorite roll was the royal dragon....deep fried dragon roll....tempura, cream cheese, avacado, etc.
I did notice on some of the rolls where shrimp wasn't the main ingredient...they used baby shrimp.

It's closed, not sure when it happened, but its gone.
There is a orange sticker on the door from some law enforcement agency.
We've dined here several times and liked it, but have gone elsewhere since there were so many choices in town.
Today we went to Tay Yo on Eastern (EX Makinos) and they were out of business too!
Then to Wonder Sushi and they are history too.
Bad day for Sushi, I guess.
We had mediocre burritos at Rubios.
Had my mouth all set for Sushi and was twice dissapointed.
The warning sticker on the door makes me Wonder about Wonder Sushi.
Sad times for everyone.
