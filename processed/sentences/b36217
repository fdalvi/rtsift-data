This place is actually pretty nice.
I was referred by a friend but was a little scared because of the price (it's low).
Turns out that its well decorated and comfortable up front.
The Dr. was nice and definitely got me to crack.
The thing that scared me at first was the price but that turned out to be the best part!
I paid about $20 for my first adjustment.
Since then I've been back and signed up for their membership thing and that makes it even cheaper.

Always friendly and helpful.
Interested in my chiropractic needs and helping me get back in shape.
I like their no-shenanigans approach to chiropractic care.
Highly recommended!

Excellent location and customer service.
Dr. Kozar is the best and always excellent and walk out feeling great!
Met the owners today and they couldn't have been nicer or more helpful.
Highly recommend.

Just went to this place.
Waiting 45 minutes for patients ahead of me and the doctor took the girl who came in 10 minutes after I did!!!
This place was a joke to begin with.
Definitely a company in it for the quick money turn around.
The 3 people ahead of me all were told a program that would require them to come in 2 times a week vs the 4 convenient monthly plans they have posted online.

I have great health insurance so I could go to a chiropractor and have a $10 co pay.
But I prefer to go here because I do not have to make an appointment (I don't think that I've ever waited more then 5 minutes), they don't try to sell me vitamins or massages, and they don't try to convince me to pay for other services that I don't need.
This is how chiropractic should be.
I've been going for a month and my back is the best it's felt in years.
I love this place!
