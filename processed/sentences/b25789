found it across from gate 9 at sky harbor.
Ethiopian brew of the day made me a fan.
Cream cheese danish was not too sweet and fair value.

:-) GRRRRReat vanilla latte

Stopped in at their location at Terminal 2 near gate 9 prior to my flight.
The service was quick and professional and there was not a line.
Iced or hot yoy will be pleased with quality typical of the chain.

Oh how I love Coffee Bean!
I love their Hot Vanilla and the staff at this location is super friendly and quick to make your drink!

very good coffee, quick service, and a lot of selection.
THis was a great coffee stop at the Phoenix Airport.

You would do better walking across the hallway to Wendy's and getting coffee there.
The Coffee Bean had no customers in line yet I had to wait 6 minutes to be waited on.
While waiting I noticed they sell cans of chocolate powder topper to take home, but do you think they could put any out for customers who just purchased a large expensive cappuccino?
You guest it NO.
Maybe the chocolate powder would have helped improve the taste of their bitter coffee.
Yuk!
Just a captive audience.
