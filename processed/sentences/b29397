I was in Las Vegas for a short vacation and decided to stop into this shop to get a couple new charms for my Pandora bracelet.
The first time I went in, it was a madhouse.
Absolute insanity.
So, I went back a second time a day later.
I found the store empty.
I was met by the friendliest woman and she helped me find everything I was looking for.
I found six charms that I love and the service was impeccable.
Cannot say enough that I recommend this store and its service.

This is just like any other Pandora Jewelry shop.
The only difference is that they offer the lucky dice.
It is actually a charm that was originally retired, however now it can only be picked up in Vegas.
I had to pick up two - one for me and one for my mom - that way we can always remember our time in Vegas Baby!

Very friendly and helpful service.

Super friendly shop, nice workers.
I got the lucky dice.
I asked if the shop had anything exclusive to LV and they directed me to some new (boring) winter stuff and the dice.
I paid with a card, no hassle there.
It's a nice little treat for yourself while you're away on vacation.
A lot of what's in this mall is waaaaaay too expensive (a Chanel scarf, 18"x18" = $385) but this is pretty accessible to most Americans.

This location is just as nice as the other store located in Honolulu.
I didn't buy anything at this one since our State tax is cheaper back home but such a magical charm store that's sure to please any collector!

On Wednesday I went to the Pandora at Fashion Show Mall to buy the dice.
The bracelet was a recent BD gift.
The very helpful sales woman showed me the newest charm....a silver dangle with the Welcome to Vegas sign!!!
So I bought both!!
She also rearranged my charms to showcase the dice.
Very happy with charms and service
