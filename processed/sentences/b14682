Pros: Friendly service.
Crushed & Cubed Ice.
Con: Small parking lot which isn't ideal for the location on the NW corner.

Havn't had too many good experiences here.
For one, they are closed daily from 2am-3pm, same as the store on 52nd and Van Buuren two blocks away, which is a huge inconvenience when you work at Bars and stop by the closest gas station to your house and the two closest are closed.
Also last week we stopped by in a hurry around 10pm, and one of the older lady's refused to ring us up, because she was "off the clock" and we had to wait for the other cashier to run inside, put his stuff away, change shirts, and then was able to help us on the other register.
As we stood there waiting, I asked the lady why she couldn't ring us up because we were in a hurry and she was rude and explained we had to wait for the next cashier because he was late and she was off (even though in uniform behind the counter).
Definately stop by 7/11 down the road or another store elsewhere.

I stop by this gas station frequently and the staff is always friendly and prompt.
I took one star off because the parking lot is so small and hard to manage at busier times.
Also I pumped gas from this location last week and the gas pump ran EXTREMELY slow!
I'm not sure if there was a problem at the pump or if this is a daily occurrence.
