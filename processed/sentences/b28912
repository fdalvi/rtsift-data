If you want luxury, you will not find it here, if you want a filling meal at a bargain price, you will find it in abundance.
Situated close to Cineworld, it is ideal for a pre or post film munch.
There is seating inside, although quite limited and most people opt to take their food out.
I generally go for the pizza, which is admittedly quite greasy, but at £3.20 for 10 inches of Margherita pizza, you can hardly go wrong.
My friend usually goes for a burger and chips and you are able to customise your burger with a choice of sauces and salads.
There are also burgers and chips, curries and kebabs on offer, all very modestly priced too.
Further, the staff seem very bubbly and happy to have a chat with you while your food is being prepared too.

Quality late night food can sometimes come from surprising places, Spicy Bite is one of those and it comes in the form of pakora (made here not bought in), this is my main reason for coming here.
They offer kebabs, burgers and pizza too, but I recommend the pakora...
I have yet to try a curry (they stop making them at a certain point in the evening) however I fully intend to at some point.

Spicy bite still does great pakora (still made on site) and decent kebabs, pizzas and burgers, however I have now had a chance to try the curries and they are good...
The food is great value (£7.20 for a curry and rice, 2.50 for veg pakora) and it is tasty and filling so at the end of the day Spicy Bite is a small unassuming takeaway which delivers decent food at a good price.
It doesn't look like much on the outside but Spicy Bite is a good choice for pre/post cinema food (I would go with pre given the quality and price of cinema food) and it serves the kebab house staples until late.
