I love carePoint dental for all they have done I'm confident in them

I have been going to CarePoint since 2009 now, and I am very pleased.
They do not rip you off, they tell you what you need, not what they want to do (like many rip off dentists in this town).
Always very nice, everyone there!
They are open on Saturday, which is very convenient for me since I have a work schedule that makes it hard for me to make weekday appointments.
They start with what I need when I get there for my appointment, I rarely have to ever sit in the lobby, which I love because I hate waiting.
Very professional, nice staff, and that's very rare in a doctor's office anymore.
I'm glad they are there, they make my life easier, and I have nothing negative to say about Carepoint Dental.

If you are like me-terrified of going to the dentist, go here!
I put off a root canal for YEARS out of  fear.
I finally chose to come here to have it done (along with all the other things I now need from putting it off lol) And I'm thankful I did.
I guess they can sense me fear bc they will continue to ask throughout my time there if I am okay and if I am feeling any pain.
Good people.

CarePoint Dental - You are the best.
Thank you for consistently providing an atmosphere that is caring.
Your services are the best, the staff is great and prices are fair.
I will continue to bring my family and refer my friends.
Overall - Outstanding dental office.
