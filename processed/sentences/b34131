I've always thought places like Scotmid and Sainsburys don't really need to be reviewed.
You know what you're going to get.
There's rarely any huge variations between one store and another.
But this Scotmid is different.
This Scotmid has Chuckles.
Chuckles is a person.
An employee.
She has worked for Scotmid for 18 years or something.
If she is working, she makes any visit to this Scotmid memorable, both negatively and positively.
If you're in a hurry, she'll start to drone on about whatever ailment is plaguing her at that precise moment.
If you've forgotten your ID, she'll make a scene then derail the situation into some 'round-the-dinner-table racism.
She'll turn buying milk and bread into an absolute nightmare if you ask how her day was.
Anyway, these are all negatives.
I did mention that being served by her can be a positive experience.
I lied.
Chuckles can and will ruin your day.
Her outlandish displays of horrendous customer service are legendary in these parts.
Enough to knock two (2) full stars off this review of an otherwise quite decent Scotmid.

I went in to this store to buy a bottle of water and a packet of crisps before I went for a wander, not knowing when or where I was next going to eat so thought it best to have a pack of something to keep me going.
After getting what I had to get I went to the checkout to be ignored for a minute or two as the gent finished his conversation with another colleague.
To be fair, the colleague was much more interesting than me and was giving him the "look and nod" to let him know there was a customer waiting.
In terms of stock and cleanliness, everything is kept to a pretty high standard, everything is nicely stocked and organised.
Nice store, just a shame that one thing knocked a few star or two off.
