I work across the street at Xtreme Manufacturing and my shipping department uses this port for all last minute shipments.
The staff is awesome!

YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(120/365) "DO NOT Return To Sender!
"  Don't you hate it when your work schedule conflicts with the UPS Man?
Already receiving two "We missed you" notices, I needed to act fast before my Moscato  shipment was gonna be sent back to Wine Country.
Called the number on the slip,located my package, and asked them to hold it so I could pick it up myself.
Luckily for me, this location is open past 6 pm when I get off work, and is on the way home.
Parking was plentiful, service was great, and there were no lines when I got there.
about 5-10 minutes later, got my shipment....quick, painless, and no problemo!
ALOHA!!!
