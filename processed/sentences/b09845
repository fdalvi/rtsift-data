We have been going to Vicki / Precious Paws since we moved here 4 years ago and have not had ONE negative experience.
Sure there are closer groomers but not one that we could trust the way we trust Vicki with our little girl.
She gets really booked up so plan your visits, you won't be disappointed!

Outstanding hair cut, nail trim & ear cleaning service.
Thank you Josh!
We will use you from now on to care for our baby - and we will tell all our dog parent friends in the neighborhood to ask for you.

They do an absolutely fantastic job every time!
Denise does our Ellie's hair and always pleases with his she looks.
They are all very friendly.
Would recommend this place to everyone!
