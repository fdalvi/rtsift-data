As you may guess, I am not an expert in fashion and accessory stores.
However, I was recently dragged into Unico by my girlfriend, who was looking for various accessories to go with an outfit.
I was pleasently suprised by Unico - it was full of things that my girlfriend said were fashionalbe and lovely, and the staff were really nice ( I ended up talking to one while I was hanging around bored).
The shop is really small but has a huge selection of things crammed into every nook and cranny.
There were more than accessories as well, with everything from bags to scalfs - prices were also pretty cheap.

This is one of the many little clothes and jewellery stores on Southbridge/Nicolson/Clerk/South Clerk Street... the day this street gets one name I shall rejoice!
I suspect the man I usually see working in there is the owner, and he's friendly enough!
If you've ever been to Lookah, just opposite Old College, you'll see this shop definitely has the same inspiration.
They sell some clothes, which aren't that memorable, but it's the colourful and Indian-inspired jewellery and bags that are "unico" in this shop (I couldn't help myself!
) It's not an expensive store either, so you can really go crazy and decide to cover your whole arm in bangles if you feel like it!

Unico was once described to me as one of those shops that sold European stuff, bits and pieces that you see in markets in France and Spain.
And it kinda is.
It's cheap and cheerful.
Don't expect to have the stuff you buy there last very long.
At all.
They sell a variety of cheap boho scarves, leg-warmers, those big airy trousers, skirts, earrings, rings, etc.
I've only ever been there for leg-warmers as I normally don't know where to go for that kinda item.
They lasted a few months.
The quality was alright, but not perfect.
The staff are, and have always been, friendly to me.
Teensy shop, but full of stuff.
Mostly stuff you probably don't need, but most shops in Edinburgh are like that anyway.
