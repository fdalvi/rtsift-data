Very nice and friendly staff.
Great sense of humor even early in the am and after I drove all night.
Great job guys.

What a Great Staff!!!!!!!!!!!!

The staff here are great!
We just returned a truck today, and the guy at the counter said there would be a $100 fee for any bodies in the trailer.
I said, "Actually, there are two bodies.
"  He said, "Excuse me ?
"   I said, "Well, you know, sometimes you have to take out the witnesses too.
"  Both he and the girl who inspected the truck were very polite and understanding about the whole thing, and even waived the crime scene cleanup fee.
Thanks, U-Haul!

These guys here are awesome!
They went out of their way to help make everything work great for the car hauler we needed to bring our new car we bought in Vegas, home!
Very polite and hard working in the Vegas heat!
