Save yourself the $52.
Shady characters lingering around, people sitting outside in the parking lot and a mother half dressed w/ her son in tow (wearing a diaper and no shoes)@ 11pm was not the kind of welcome I expected in Phoenix.
$2.99 wi-fi charge.
Way better places to stay in the area.
Room was clean.
Staff was polite.
Shady area, even a security guard is walking the grounds.

For under 45 dollars you cannot beat this place, the rooms are clean, the staff was nice, the location was off the freeway, there were a few other hotels but decided on staying in this one, it is close to a few restaurants and bars, and i think a shopping mall area, not too sure.
Rooms were comfortable, showers were spacious and also clean.
No complaints here at all.
So if your need a good sleep and your near this place, give them a try.

this motel sucks!!
never going to stay in thsi Arizona dumpe ever again.
