I get my hair done there and I love it.
I have curly hair and have had more bad haircuts than I can count.
I know every time I go I will leave happy and beautiful.
The salon itself is gorgeous, and the staff and stylists are professional and friendly.
I drive a long way every month to go to Haute Fringe, and it is totally worth the time and gas it takes.
I wouldn't dream of going anywhere else!

I got my gel nails done at Haute Fringe with Marianne.
She's super sweet and professional.
I got my toes done too!
I would recommend going to see Marianne.
The best way to reach her is on her cell.

Melinda is exceptional!
I have thin, fine hair that is very difficult to cut and style.
I am very particular about who I will have cut, color or style my hair.
This salon is the perfect experience.
They have a wide variety of services and are always friendly and eager to help with any of my needs.
I love love love it and would highly recommend Haute Fringe to anyone.

Everything about this place I loved!
Lindsey was my hairstylist and she was amazing!Very friendly when I called to make the appt.
and even sweeter when I met her in person.
The salon itself was very clean and modern looking.
Plus I like how it's not far from where I live.
My hair is exactly how I wanted it and it looks even better than I expected.
She may be a younger hairstylist but very knowledgable and did a great job giving me what I wanted!
Thank you so much again and I definitely will be returning!
I have found my salon and my new hairstylist :))

Vanessa = the best.
I've seen her at a different salon as well, but this place is much more fitting.
The salon is a great size, very clean, and very professional overall.
It has a sleek look and the stylists definitely know what they're doing.
If you're making a random appointment, ask for Vanessa.
She did my Keratin treatment and recommended some really great products to keep my hair healthy.
(It was a massive disaster of dryness and dead-ends before I saw her...)  I'm going back for a deep conditioning treatment this week (6 weeks after my original appt) and I can't wait.
:)   The location is pretty far out of the way for me, but it's worth the drive.
