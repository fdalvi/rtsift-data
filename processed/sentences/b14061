I'll spare you the dumb story as to how I hurt my back one Friday morning.
Let's just say that after the incident, the process of moving from sitting to standing and vice versa was quite painful and had not improved in a day and a half.
I decided to go to urgent care on a Saturday afternoon.
I have not been to an urgent care in a few years and I was happy with my experience at CHW in Ahwatukee.
Saturday afternoon seems like a good time to go.
There was only one other person in the waiting room.
Less than 5 minutes and my name was called.
The nurse that did the initial assessment and took my vitals was very friendly and caring, more than any other nurse I have interacted with in the last few years.
She offered to carry my purse back to the room, asked me if I wanted some water to drink or a cold pack for my back.
She took the pillow from the bed (since I couldn't lay on it because of my back) and set it up in the chair for me.
Then she turned on the TV (in the exam room?!
) and put the nurses call button over the bed so I could reach it if needed.
Not much to say about the doctor.
He asked a few questions and checked my (limited) mobility.
When talking to him I felt a little rushed, as if he was already on to the next question before I had finished my answer to the first.
Then again, I have had a hurt back before, so I already had an idea there wasn't much he could do for me other than give me something to help with the pain.
I wasn't expecting much, just drugs.
Then a different guy came in to explain my prescriptions to me.
I really appreciated that.
I've been to doctors in the past where they just had you the slip and send you on your way without really telling you why, what, or how about your prescription.
Overall, going to urgent care is never a fun experience, but this time my visit was pretty good .
considering.
Then again maybe it is just the drug-induced haze I'm in right now as a result of the muscle relaxers they gave me.
=)  Oh well, either way, I'm happy!

AVOID!
They bill as an Emergency Room to try and get an extra copay out of you.

Arrived at 4:30 for my own not-so smart incident.
I think i need stitches!
Four other patients in front of me.
The nurse on duty said they would be right with me.
Got called by the RN at 4:59, back in the waiting room at 5:08.
Got my bracelet and clean gauze.
At least there's a plug-in or two in the waiting room to the left of the front door to charge my iPhone.
Front desk nurse offered something to drink for another patient, then offered drinks to us all in the waiting room.
Not a bad policy!
5:52 made it to an examination room.
Waiting for the doctor.
6:22 Dr Tejada came took a look and agreed, stitches.
6:26 moved to a procedure room and received two stitches and bandaged up.
Out the door at 7:04.
Not too bad a wait, friendly and professional staff.

Called ahead 12:00 gave me a time for 2:45.
3:00 They called to come down.
4:30 I'm still waiting.
That was the quick service?.
It wasn't even busy.
Mistyped medical forms.
The antibiotic has a listed complication.
Oh yeah, we'll have to retype the prescriptions.
Wait more.
The staff spent more time on insurance billing codes than patient needs.
A sharps  box (used needles) on the floor.
Nurse tells kids stick hands in "all the time".
Don't let your kids stick hands in.?
What is the box doing on the DAMN floor?
I wouldn't even take my dog to this place.
Stay away.

This place has insurance fraud written all over it!
Did you know, that this URGENT CARE - as stated on every single sign on and around the facility - is really a HOSPITAL??
Yes, really!!
And, when do you find this out??
When you receive a bill for over $500 from your insurance company!
I can't believe this place has the nerve to place DIGNITY anywhere near their name...even more appalling is the fact that the state allows this place to continue to fleece patients as an ER!
We were new to the area and my husband had developed an ear infection.
This place was around the corner from our apartment and stated URGENT CARE - which our PPO covers all but $50.
So, he spent two hours waiting for some doctor to look in his ear for two minutes, declare he had an ear infection, write him a script for a Z-pack and sent him on his way.
A few weeks later, we get a bill from these crooks for over $320!!
This is AFTER our insurance paid them nearly $200!
We called our insurance - who also agreed that the costs were outrageous - and was informed that this place considers themselves an ER and billed the visit as such!
If you drive past the place, all you see are three different signs declaring it an URGENT CARE.
No one bother's to inform you it's a "hospital.
" How they continue to get away with this is baffling!
For me, they can pay a collections company to come after me - I have never skipped out on any bills in my life, but hell will freeze over before they get one thin dime from me for this bullsh*t!

Conveniently close to Chandler and Ahwatukee.
Been here four times in the last 10 or so years; everything from being mauled by a dog to bronchitis.
Was here seven months ago for a serious pain episode stemming from a "back injury" -HAHAHAHAHA, uh, that actually turned out to be a dead 10lb kidney beating up my spine.
Jerri (??
) the PA was fantastic.
Knew pretty much all she could do was write some scrips for prescription smack (if you say yay fun drugs I will clock you - there's nothing fun about hallucinations) and tell me to hit the ice.
Jerri has better bedside manner than most doctors and nurses combined.
Never have used the call ahead feature.
Also, check your insurance about billing before you go here.
My co-pay was a little more than $40, but been hearing from Yelpers and friends that they bill as a hospital.
It's basically what I'd expect from an Urgent Care facility.
I realize we're all entitled to our opinions, but come on, Yelpers!
Do y'all seriously expect the proverbial "red carpet" to be rolled out?
It's just like going to an Emergency Room.

Not happy.
Came in with my daughter who had extreme pain and swelling in both legs.
They didn't register her and then they kept us waiting for an hour.
When asked I was told they have a "call ahead" system so some others are ahead of me.
Really?
Since when was urgent medical care taking reservations?
I would do better to go into the ER.
I think I will bypass this place in the future.

This place has always been amazing.
I've been here several times over the past 5 yrs.
The staff is so friendly.
One of the nurses offered me a blanket after she noticed the room she put me in was cold.
I didn't even have to ask.
They have a call ahead program.
Use it or the wait times can be lengthy.
Nurses and Drs are very thorough and spend time with you.
I was given pages of useful information to take home with me as well.
I have been to many other urgent cares and this one is superior.
I'm very surprised by the low ratings.
I was charged my usual co-pay of $50 for an urgent care visit.

A few days before Christmas I got a cold (pretty typical for me), sore throat, cough, the works basically.
Like normal it started going away after a little while though so I didn't worry about it.
The weird thing though was that the cough never went away.
Then a couple days ago it started getting worse!
I decided I should probably get it checked out to make sure it wasn't something serious.
Dignity Health was near my work and able to get me in right away so I stopped in to see them.
The girl at the front was friendly and got me signed in quickly.
After a few minutes another nice lady came to take me into the back and get all my information.
Once that was finished she took me to a waiting room for the actual doctor.
He was also friendly when he arrived and asked lots of questions and checked out my lungs to figure out what was going on.
Apparently I had Bronchitis so he gave me a prescription for some antibiotics to help take care of it.
Everyone I dealt with was friendly, knowledgeable and I was in and out within a reasonable amount of time.
As much as you don't WANT to need to go to an urgent care center, if I have to again in the future I would make sure to come here.

This place is not good and their billing department is the worst!
I am about to write to the Better Business Bureau!

Good service...friendly team...:)
