The new manager here is simply amazing.
I believe her name is Libertie.
I came in to exchange a pair of shoes and she was all smiles when it came to helping me.
I usually hate shopping but to be honest I actually look forward being able to go back for my next pair of shoes.
Without a doubt this is a place to stop by if you are in Town Square and need a pair of shoes.
High quality and low price... add the insanely kind service of Libertie and it's a definite.

Manager named India.
She was the sweetest and most helpful manager I have yet encountered in retail.
The location in fashion show mall has a bit of a snottier staff.
Townsquare location: they are just the nicest people.
(I had a few issues on a refund that I hadn't received in 15 days and right when I got on the phone she had taken control if the problem)
