First off.
Disregard the one star by Cheryl.
This place is under a new name (meineke) and new ownership.
The experience I had was awesome!
Highly professional, and I even got the chance to meet the owner because she was working the front desk.
While you wait for you car to be done you can grab some high end coffee, water, or an array of snacks.
While watching a nice flat screen tv.
also there is a kids station in the corner with coloring books and crayons!
(genius!
)I don't think the food or drinks are free but I didn't ask.
Hands down most comfortable oil change place I have been to!
I highly recommend this place

$23.75 for a basic oil change.
I came here not knowing what to expect due to 2 completely opposite reviews.
I had called ahead of time and they stated a basic oil change was $19 (without tax of course).
The employees I spoke with were knowledgable and courteous.
I chose to come here because I hate places like jiffy lube that try to sell you "headlight fluid" or walk out with a drop of dirty fluid and say "look how dirty this is!
You should replace it right away.
" They informed me of a few suggested maintenance areas that I could have done based on my mileage (~90,000) but I didn't have any done because I knew it wasn't required.
Bottom line: cheap oil change with little wait time (maybe because of the horrible review on here?
) with free coffee and wifi.
Please note my tip about the location incase the map isn't corrected.
Good luck!
