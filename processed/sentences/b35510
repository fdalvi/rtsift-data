Ryan has taken such good care of my vehicles, I couldn't imagine taking them any place else.
He does a better job than the Dealerships I have tried and at a lower price.
I trust him to let me know what needs to be fixed now, and what can wait, and he does the repairs the right way not the quick way.
Also, I agree with the other reviewer that mentioned that Ryan doesn't just replace parts, he fixes cars, and there is a difference Bottom line if you are looking a mechanic with a great work ethic and the skill to get the job done, I recommend you give him a try.

Ryan is a great tech that is honest and fair!
I would not hesitate to bring my vehicles to him again.
I have more than  15 yrs in the car business, so I know this part of it.
