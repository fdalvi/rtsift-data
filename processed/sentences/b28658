I admire what this place does, they collect and restore old fashioned furniture to an excellent standard, so much so that they offer a 15 year guarantee on everything.
What I don't admire is the £995 for a table...

This place is absolutely fantastic and I'm so glad I stumbled upon it one day when The Man dragged my hungover bum out the door and for a walk to discover our new neighborhood.
We are doing up our house at the moment and, having moved from a flat, are in desperate need for furniture.
We'd chosen to visit this part of town to check out the antique stores and happened upon Vintage and Reclaimed.
The owner explained that the furniture is all new, but his standard stock is made from reclaimed timbers which gives it a fantastic look.
He also stocks furniture made by someone down south (I think??
) which has a more finished look to it and is also gorgeous.
The best part about this place is that they are willing to make what you want to size.
This means that if you fall in love with a piece of furniture they have on the shop floor and devastatingly discover that it won't fit in your house, not a problem!
They will make one of the size and colour which you like.
On top of this, the prices are SO reasonable.
Seriously.
The Man and I are looking for a massive wardrobe and the one we found here was a good £700+ cheaper than any other one we liked.
After we left here we visited the aforementioned antique stores but just kept saying "it's not as good as Vintage and Reclaimed" so we gave up and decided that once the building work is done, we will scrape together our pennies and spend them all here.
