I have been suffering from a bad head cold the last few days and after putting it off I decided I needed to do something about it.
Only problem is, it's the day before Christmas Eve.
Most doctors are off on vacation.
I found the Las Vegas Strip Urgent Care through a friend.
I was unsure about the service since I am used to sitting in a lobby or waiting room and filing out all kinds of paperwork but I didn't have many other options.
I called the doctor and was surprised when he answered.
No receptionist or automated machine.
A real human!
I told him my symptoms and that I could probably use some antibiotics.
He was very polite and asked me several questions to ensure it wasn't anything serious.
He recommended I take a Z pack and told me he could meet me to deliver the medication.
I was relieved since this meant no waiting for a pharmacy or driving around town.
He provided me with much needed antibiotics and I am on my way to a healthy holiday.
Thank you 24 Hour Vegas Doctor!

I was seen in a timely manner.
I thought I had broken my hand and with the on-site X-ray machine, my suspicions were confirmed.
The doctor was polite and funny.
If you don't have a GP or are a tourist I would suggest going here over the hospital across the street.
I was patched up and sent on my way in about an hour.

I woke up this morning with Fever Blisters/cold sores  aka herpes on my lips.
Always tried over the counter remedies..
Non work so years ago my Dr called in Valtrex.
It stops the spreading.
While on Vacation I had an outbreak due to having a fever all night.
I had  one Valtrex with me.
So I called my Dr's office at home (Texas)   After waiting an hour for the call.....
The Dr on call said since I have not been in the office in a year... She couldn't call in a prescription.
I asked just for 2 days worth and said I will come see you when I get back home in a few days.
She said call an urgent care in Vegas.
So I started thinking.. Where can I find one out here... Well to no surprise they are all over.
Who wants to wait 2 hours to be seen..
When you know what is wrong and what you need?
I called this place.. DR Logan answers to the phone.
2 options.. Come to me in Hotel or based on what he here's and past medial experience he was able to do a visit over the phone.
$50.. 15-20 mins later based on all kinds of medical questions and routine he was able to call in a prescription for a few days at Walgreens.
Apparently the laws are different out here.
He even offered to call my Dr at home and talk to them  I said no.
He was very careful in his process.
Then he gives me his cell phone number and said call me 24/7   Thank God for this service.
I may have been given all of these options based on how confident I was with my issue and past experience and I am a guest of the city and not a resident.
No guarantees you will get over the phone visit..
I think it had to do with how I know exactly what was wrong with me.
Point is... No need to wait in line and spend a fortune at Urgent care facilities.
$50 and I was done.
