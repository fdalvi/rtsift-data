the place is good but the kicker for me is its down the street from my house.
The chili chesse sliders with onions is my favorite, also the garlic fries.
The prices are great too, a slider combo will only set you back about $7 with drink.
Everything is made fresh and the food is cooked pretty rather quickly; i mean how long does it take to cook a little hamburger patty anyway?
They also got fish for you people that dont eat meat.
I would recommend this place over the neighborhood Ruby Tuesdays; unfortunately the drive from the vegas strip is a little much if you are looking for slider burgers in particular; but if you got the time then by all means go there.

Fair thee well you probably won't be missed but I shall always remember the grease the heat and the other fry cook shedding in the food... peace out bitches maybe now you can run a REAL RESTAURANT  and stop expecting 5 star service out of a staff paid LESS then minimum wage ya psycho!
