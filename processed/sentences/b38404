My boyfriend stopped in to get pizzas...Several employees ignored him although there were no other customers.
He noticed dead flies on the pineapple and other toppings which were not covered.
He finally walked out without ever being spoken to by staff who saw him standing there.

I've been to this location a few times and let me just start by saying the customer service was terrible.
On top of that i saw many different kinds of bugs including dead flies on the toppings and even inside the herb and cheese shaker.
I saw several dead cockroaches right outside by the front door and I even saw a live one right inside the customer lobby!
I assume the entire store is crawling with many insects.
I also noticed many of the employee's hair hanging down past their shoulders right next to the pizza they are prepping for the customers and the owner didn't seem to mind too much.
If you are in the mood for Papa Murphy's I highly suggesting trying another location.

Great food, service needs to be better!
Please acknowledge your customers when they arrive and give them the courtesy of knowing you will be with them in a moment if you are busy.

BEST pizza and fresh toppings.

Came here for the first time because I had a coupon.
The place was busy at 4pm but I was greeted and helped promptly.
The staff that waited on me was friendly and they were helpful when I ordered.
Lastly the pizza was really good.
I wasn't sure but I followed instructions for baking and the pizzas turned out perfect.
I will come again the next time I crave pizza.
Highly recommend!

Their chicken bacon artichoke delite Pizza is fabulous.
