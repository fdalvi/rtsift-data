DO NOT GO HERE!!!!
Worst place I've ever been in Vegas... Service is terrible, food is terrible, overpriced and they false advertise prices on their own menu.
The waitress tells me that prices have changed from opening... Ok?
Than why do u still keep the menus?
S#*t is retarded... To add insult to injury, our bill was 30 dollars, they charged us 86 and when we asked why, the waitress reluctantly said they had to charge us 10 per person for service...
This is highway robbery.
Patrons beware

DO NOT COME HERE!
they charge a minimum of $10 per person no matter what!
if u don't order, $10.
if u order something less than $10, they still charge u $10.
RIDICULOUS!
I came here to meet some friends.
it's a very small Chinese karaoke bar with only 6 tables and a very minimal drink selection.
when we were ready to leave, we find our check at $80+ when we only ordered a couple appetizers and a few drinks.
they have a menu and say it's over 3 years and prices have changed.
really?
this place must be doing bad because they can't afford new menus!
i left this place feeling robbed.
IF I CAN GIVE THIS PLACE NEGATIVE RATING, I WOULD!!
