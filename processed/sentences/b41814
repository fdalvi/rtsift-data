Tonight was our first time here at this new restaurant.
We ordered:  ~Napa saut√©ed with dried shrimp ~Hot & Spicy Pork Intestine & Sliced fish in Clay Pot ~Smoked duck ~Whole red snapper in chef's special hot sauce ~Chinese eggplant in garlic sauce ~Szechuan style bean curd (with minced beef) ~Chunk of chicken in spicy sauce ~Minced pork with translucent noodle  Fair warning: this is NOT an oil-free meal.
Most of the dishes we ordered were soaked in chili oil, but that is Szechuan cuisine.
All the dishes were great, but my favorites were the napa, smoked duck, egg plant, and translucent noodle.
The red snapper dish is actual tilapia.
Overall, great place for authentic Szechuan cuisine!

Food here was good.
Really can not complain.
But it was a little pricey for chinese food in my opinion.
Especially because the portions were kinda small.
Service was ok.
If you could get their attention they were very friendly and helpful.
The problem there lies in getting their attention.
There were only two tables when I was there (ours and one other), yet it still took for ever to get someone to look our way.
They seemed to be always preoccupied either staring back into the kitchen or just staring out the window.
Overall it was still ok.
Decent food.

Food is good , but price is on the high side in my opinion .
I would go back more if price is little cheaper !
