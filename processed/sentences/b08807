It's close.
It's cheap enough.
It's a few feet from Scratch Bakery.
All these are great reasons to try Chaparral Cleaners and Laundry.
I've been to a few dry cleaners where they "can't" get stains out of the clothes, and won't even try -- WTF???
Chaparral has never had any problems getting the huge coffee stains out of my white and khaki pants -- yes, I'm a clutz -- and they also haven't melted any of the beadwork on some of the other tops I've brought inhere -- and for that, I salute them.

I don't think I can say much about a dry cleaner to keep you glued to this review, but I will say I have had no problems in the 2 years I've used them.
No little tags that say "we tried and tried..but your garment still looks like crap.
"  The prices are reasonable, and a few of the girls even remember my name even though I'm not in all that often.
Nice touch.

Cant find their new address on yelp, but they moved to camelback and miller.
I have been going here for about 8 years.
I have never had a problem.
I have got to know Dan over the years and he is a very nice person.
And to top it off they can usually have my stuff back to me the same day.
