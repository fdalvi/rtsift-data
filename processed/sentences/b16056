Look for Charlie, this guy knows his stuff!
Excellent service.
He was able to diagnose the problem quickly and resolved the issues.
I highly recommend him.

CHARLIE SAVED MY LIFE.
We were involved in a hit and run leaving the strip.
We were stranded on the side of the road and had the vehicle towed off to a motel, where we checked in for the night.
This man left his shop when he was very very busy....  We told him all we could afford, and he didn't stiff us with that.
He really gave us a price we could work with...and still have money left over.
Since we DID have to go and get two new tires....
Such a random review, it being I live in Orange County, but this man and his business deserve this praise.
When I make a trip back to Vegas (which won't be for a long time given the bad luck with car trouble EVERY trip out there), I will personally stop by and thank him again for everything he did.....even though I feel it still won't be enough.

dont go there he charged me an arm and leg for a transmission that went bad after 6 month and never took respnsibility for his mistake.....i recved the van from day one with tranny issues  and owner said it willv get better...and broke down again with thesame issue
