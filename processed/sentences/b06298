Tangles is a nice mid-range neighborhood salon - not ultra-fancy, very high end and snooty, but not the haircare equivalent of Burger King.
It's modern and comfortable.
Gigi is my hairdresser, and she does a great job cutting and coloring my hair.
Her prices are reasonable, and she's quick to return calls so that I can schedule appointments.
I tried a number of other hairdressers at other salons before finding Gigi, and now I'm here for the long haul.
Tangles has a good number of hairdressers of both sexes to choose from, and the shop caters to both women and men.
Good work, good prices, good availability.
What more could I want?

Come in and see Maria Overbeck very good hairstylist.
Good color and haircuts

Tangles is a great hair salon.
Gigi is my stylist and I couldn't be happier with her.
Not only is she the sweetest gal, she knows how to cut my thin, long hair to make it look as full as possible.
The salon is quite nice, mid-range, clean and neat and the prices are very reasonable.
I don't need all the unnecessary extras, just a great cut and I get that here each time.
Highly recommend..
