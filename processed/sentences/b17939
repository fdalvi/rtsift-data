Nice and clean little cafe, perfect for breakfast.

This place is awesome, especially when I don't feel like racing to the commisarry, fast food or chow hall!
Give yourself 15 minutes though, everything is cooked to order.
Use the services on base!
They'll disappear if you don't!

The breakfast here was so delicious!
The burritos and breakfast biscuits  were to die for!
As you can see I'm using past tense, since they no longer serve breakfast here!
:( so disappointing!
