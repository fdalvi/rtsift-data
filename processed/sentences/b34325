Only Post Office that I know that is open 7 days a week and close late at 7pm.
I'm not a morning person and I don't like leaving my packages outside for the mail person to come & pick it up.
Someone may come and steal it.
My favor Post office.
It's not a full service post office.
It's an express so you can only drop packages/ mail and buy stamps which is great for me.
Cause I do everything online anyways.
If you have a prepaid package just skip the line and drop it off next to the cashier on the left side there is a huge cart.
So fast and easy.

Quick and easy!
The staff here is great, polite and chatty.
I still prefer the one in city stop, only because I hate going into Albertstons.

This would be a great neighborhood convenience if it were not for the fact that their opening hours are seemingly random.
One can go to post a package anywhere between 12 noon and 4 pm and there is a high likelihood that it will be closed for "lunch".
I hope to think that my tax dollars are not paying for these workers to run this post office like this.
If so, it's no wonder the USPS is in trouble.
Can you imagine UPS or FedEx not being open for hours at a time in the middle of the day?
Go to the one at the gas station/convenience store just a little ways away on Rampart.
