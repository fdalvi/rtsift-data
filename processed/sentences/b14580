Best tuner shop in Az, hands down.
I've had repairs and tuning sessions here.
They have an in house dyno, and dialed in my car reeeeeaaaaalllllll nice.
Best part, they are one of the few places that have an "all wheel" dyno, so they can do cars like WRX's, Evo's, and (for you baller's) GTR's.
If you see some of the builds going on here, you'd be impressed too.
Their shop car, an Evo, is sick!
Richard, who runs the front of the house is very knowledgeable and friendly.
Anybody who has ever tried to find a good repair shop knows that is rare.
It's said, "finding a good mechanic is harder than finding a good doctor".
Tony who is always back of house, is a tuning guru.
Best part is, he's patient and answered my questions in a way that I could understand.
Pricing was good, especially for a shop of this caliber.
Work was done quick.
Staff was knowledgeable and friendly.
Perfect trifecta.
I highly recommend them.

My car has been a project nightmare but the guys at UMS tuning helped me to straighten it out.
I've had nothing but troubles with my car from the start due to the crappy sales company selling me mismatched and refurbished equipment.
Thankfully, the guys at UMS tuning were not only able to tune my car but helped me fix the some of my issues that these other supposive car specialists couldn't.
