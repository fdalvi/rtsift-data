It doesn't get any better than this!
Several months ago I had a dental emergency on a Saturday and they were the only Dental office that was open nearby.
They got me in right away and were able to fix the problem immediately.
The entire staff were so professional, friendly, and fun, that I immediately changed dentists and have never gone anywhere else!
They always take the time to go over every part of the procedure and provide a breakdown of the proposed treatment plan including a cost estimate.
Seriously, the entire staff is amazing!
Always friendly.
Always fun.
And always there to make sure everything goes smoothly.
Even if you have another dentist you need to come in to Dr, Hodges office and see for yourself.
I'll bet you switch just like I did!

I started going to Dr. Hodges some 5 or 6 years ago because she was literally a few hundred feet from the apartment I lived in at the time.
When I bought my house over 4 years ago, I moved about 20 minutes away and I'm sure I could find lots of dentists much closer to me.
Regardless, changing dentists was NOT an option.
Dr. Hodges is wonderful, approachable, friendly, educational and just plain nice.
She always has a smile on her face and she truly cares about her patients.
In fact, she makes you feel more like a friend or guest in her home than a patient in her office.
That's not easy to find, so I could move to Tucson and I'd still drive to Chandler to see her.
While most of my visits are for cleanings every 3 months, I have had a few cavities that needed work and its clear she knows what she's doing.
She keeps up on the latest technology and techniques and I just couldn't imagine having anyone else working on my choppers.
Her staff are also welcoming and friendly.
I'd recommend this office to anyone looking for a more personal and engaging dentist visit
