I work with John.
I look forward to working out again.
I don't worry about injuries or strain because John focuses on the right movements and form.
Come check it out!

I had shoulder surgery about 2 years ago and I was getting ready to compete in a grappleing tournament.I wasnt confident in my should so i ask these guys to get my shoulder strong.
Not only did they get my shoulder better than before but my whole body is balanced and strong.
They are patient and take a whole body approach that strengthens from the inside out!
I recommend all my martial arts students to train there.

Salvador Calvano Jr. 5/2 2013 After a severe Rollover car accident  9 years agoi was told that ii would probably never play golf again.
I was introduced to Carl .
When i me tup with Carl my Arm was just  Dangling & shaking.
He evaluated me & said give me a year & you will be golfing.
I started & never looked back.,  I am now closing in on 74 years young & yes it was hell , but it was just about a year & i was swinging a club.
Carl & i are not just Trainer & student but have become good friends & he still takes good care of me 9 years later.
I feel that the workout is not just for the body but for your Head & Heart also I have Recommended others & i will continue my Training there .
Never too Old to Stay Young .
