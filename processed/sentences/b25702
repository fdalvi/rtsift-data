When our home washing machine broke and a spare timer had to be ordered, we were faced with a month-long laundry hiatus.
Looking online, we found Sparaklean not too far from home.
The experience was terrific:  Helpful and friendly staff, lots of clean modern machines of various sizes, clean facility, free wifi.
We brought LOTS of laundry and were through in an hour and a half.
Even when the home washer is fixed, we plan to come back to do larger items.

As a small business owner, service and honesty is very important.
I found Sparklean Laundry over a year ago when my business needs changed and I found myself needing hundreds of sheets washed every week.
Ben, the owner, was the only laundry service that actually called me back in a timely manner and his prices were competitive.
I have loved using them!
Ben is great to work with because you can tell that he cares about his business.
I have never had any problems with his staff or drivers and if there are any sheet issues, Ben is always quick to resolve them.
My clients frequently comment about how fresh the sheets smell and how clean they feel.
