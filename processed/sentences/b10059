I had the worst experience, at the Renaissance Pools at the Boulder Highway.
I was ready to have them build me a pool at my house, paying cash for it, but they made me feel like I was there to steal their things.
They did not want to come out to my house to give me an estimate.The owner was very rude man and gave me only seconds of his time.,  My son turned around and left, that was a clue for me to leave.
I was ready  to say some bad things to them, but it was not worth it.
I would not do business with these folks.

I met the owner who was very knowledgeable about spas and the quality difference between brands.
Installation was fast and professional, I would definitely recommend them.
