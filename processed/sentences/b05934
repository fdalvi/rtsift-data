Yelp needs a zero-star option.
NFCU is now OneNevada Credit Union.
Apparently, OneNevada or NFCU, at some point, instituted a policy that account closures will incur a $20 fee.
When I informed their customer service that I had not received this notice and asked when the notice was sent, THEY REFUSED TO RESPOND.
I made multiple inquiries and received evasive answers as to the method of giving notice and as to what address notice was sent.
To pile up bad on top of bad, apparently (according to the National Credit Union Administration), NFCU went from a CU organized under federal law (The Federal Credit Union Act) to one organized under state law (NRS-678 http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-678.html#NRS678Sec480) recently.
This is great news, if you are the credit union.
This is horrible news if you are a consumer because there seem to be scant protections for consumers under the Nevada rules.
In other words, they can do what they want and you are free to leave...that'll be $20 to close your account.

I'm moving to Henderson and had requested insurance quotes from this credit union and I had planned to open an account with them too.
I got the auto reply that someone will be contacting me in the next day or 2,but never got a call nor an email.
I got curious and check Yelp.
No wonder .
Thanks to those whose posted reviews here.

Most of their branches are ATMs - I only know of a couple (miles away) that actually have tellers or people you can talk to.
This is a reflection that they have no interest in meeting their customers needs.
I tried to email them regarding a concern - received a response to contact them or go into a branch - now that is funny!
Don't you dare do anything that may incur charges - or you won't be extended any courtesy going forward.
Forget credit unions in this state - they are ruthless!
