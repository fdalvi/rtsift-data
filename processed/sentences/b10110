$7 per hour for racquetball with equipment for 2 players.
Sweet.
Thank you Chunk Minker for your apparent sports complex nestled just east of old downtown.
With my brother in town, we drove from Rec center, to YMCA, to finally the Chuck Minker Sports Complex, and I'm glad we did.
They were the only game in town, providing all the gear we needed to get going.
The price was right and no forms were filled out.
If you're used to a 24 Hour Fitness and Bally's, as opposed to a municipally run fitness center that's not located in a shiny new suburb, then remove 1 star.
Being urban-inclined, I'm used to the idea of a few topical blemishes and that lived-in odor.
They also have basketball courts, a workout gym, and plenty of other corridors containing who knows what... a pool maybe?

$130 for a one year of gym membership, classes, raquetball, and a suana in the locker room...That sounds like a good deal to me!
It's a tiny community gym with limited equipment but It's cheap and there are no contracts included and your money will be going to the community and not "The Man"...

Vball baby!
