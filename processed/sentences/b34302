What a fantastic surprise!
Shona helped me with the menu and was an absolute joy to talk to about Scottish food.
I had the haggis with neeps and tatties and it was all amazing.
She also sent a Scottish pie with me as I was interested in trying that as well.
My family and I were able to sample it that evening (wonderful) and I would also recommend trying that.
I was very fortunate that I went for lunch a bit after 2 in the afternoon in late November, so it was relatively quiet inside, and Shona and I  had great conversation about travelling in the United States as well as cultural differences between the States and Scotland.
Please take my advice and visit this place for a great Scottish meal with great service and conversation!!

there should be well more reviews about this quirky little cafe near the castle!
I came with a few people and they seated us all and the man serving us was a right laugh!
The only annoying thing was, they'd run out of chicken salad so I just had a vegetable soup instead!
Tasty!

Gee whizz!
This place has got to be joking.
They just served me a mince and tatties microwaved ready meal.
Absolutely staggering.
Words fail me.
Well, one springs to mind: avoid.

Ran into this little cafe for a brunch.
Ordered the Scottish breakfast for less than 8 pounds.
Very large portion with haggis, black pudding, potato scones, ham, bacon, egg, tea, toasts.
Everything tasted quite good and the owner was very friendly.
I was very full and would say this place was good for the price.
