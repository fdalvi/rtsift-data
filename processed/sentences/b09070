I am a real estate broker who used HomeSpec by accident about 12 years ago and have never used anyone since.
Not only are the inspectors excellent but the office staff cannot be equaled.
HomeSpec is an excellent company and I would recommend them to anyone who needs a thorough inspection for any reason.

HomeSpec handled the inspection for my recent home purchase in the most ideal way.
The added complication of me purchasing a home from out of state was not a problem for them in the least.
They had excellent customer service, follow up, and the inspection report was thorough and complete.
Would recommend to family and friends/use again.

we have two house inspected by Nori (owner of the company).
Very professional and go through all the detail with you.
I asked all kinds of questions from the very basic to the very tough one and he can always give you an answer.
I do learn a lot from this guy!
highly recommended.
