I can't say that I have ever stayed here overnight, but I have been here for several conferences for work and the catering was very yummy.
There is a nice foyer/dining room with a nice, relaxing patio where you can choose to eat breakfast or lunch.
Other conference-goer's who stayed overnight had no complaints about the rooms or accommodations.

AWESOME!!!
Stayed here for two weeks.
I was well catered too and so were my children.
From check-in, reception, to get settled in, through our duration and stay, until check out.
Complimentary breakfast is fairly decent.
Thank you for the wonderful experience!

3 1/2 stars  I am disappointed that they didn't offer free continental breakfast and that, as a Hilton rewards member, I didn't get a copy of the newspaper.
Ah, just occurred to me that I believe they give the wsj which doesnt have a Sunday edition and I was only there one day.
Additionaly, the bed matress felt mushy/too soft.
The positives: -Clean bedroom -Quiet -Ample Parking -Courteous staff -Easy to find/near freeway -Reasonable price

Relaxation.
Finally!!!!
I informed the staff that I was traveling in an 18 Wheeler and that I needed some "Me Time" and that starts with a great room and bathroom.
I am happy to say that our one night stay was just what I needed.
The bed was so comfortable that I didn't even get out of it to get food.
Luckily my BF was kind enough to grab us some food and I just stayed in bed watching TV.
Thanks for the comfort Hilton!!!
