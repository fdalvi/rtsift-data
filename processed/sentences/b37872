Probably one of the best Subways I have ever been to.
The shop is very big, comparatively, they have two sandwich making lines, awesome for when it's busy, and they have flat screen TVs which are great for when I am on my lunch break and want to catch up on the world happenings.
Very clean and the staff is friendly and make a great sandwich!

This is my favorite subway so far, it has two separate sections and even though it gets pretty busy everything flows pretty quickly.
This location has free Wi-fi and Ethernet connections with nearby outlets; making it great for people on the go.

I like this location because their employees are always friendly and their service is top notch!
The store is always clean, usually busy, and they also have so much to offer as far as food selections and good deals.
Also, they have free wi-fi and ethernet, so if you have your laptop or smartphone, you can use their service.
They also have tv so you can tune into whatever channel they have it on.
I recommend this location whenever you're in this part of town.
