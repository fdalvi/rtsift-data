Bryan Lamer the Manager is great!
He treats everyone professionally, respectfully and more importantly kindly.
In addition they have the best prices in town, especially with their online coupons and specials!

Mike really helped me out today when we were faced with replacing the rear brakes on my car.
Mike was able to work with us to get the job done within budget without cutting corners.
His up-front honesty made it easy to work with on hard line decisions.

I have had really good experiences at several other Brakes Plus locations in the past, but my first experience with the Signal Butte Brakes Plus could not have been any worse.
This is a very seedy and disingenuous group of guys at this location and I strongly advise anyone who is looking for honesty and integrity to steer clear of this place...WAY CLEAR!!
