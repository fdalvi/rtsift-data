Jared is a colleague of mine and he has done some work for quite a few of my clients, so that tells you the confidence I have in Jared.
He is a great attorney and my choice when any of my clients have bankruptcy issues and loan work-out issues.
Thanks Jared for taking care of those who are important to me!
I highly recommend you!
