Hooray!
Five stars for this store.
I found several nice items of clothing here and only spent $27.
:)  It is big and clean.
Also, if you make a donation, they give you 20% off your next purchase.
I'm glad I investigated this place.
I will definitely be going back.

It's big and open with tons of stuff that is fairly decent.
It's clean and bright too.
The best part?
Clothing is organized by both size and color!!!
I love when thrift stores take the time to do this, it makes my shopping experience so much more enjoyable.

Come on people it's a Goodwill..
I feel sorry for anybody giving the place a 3,4, or 5 star rating.
It's full of stuff someone dead and couldn't take with them or stuff that somebody didn't want nor did their friends.
It's usually dirty and smells.
So if this is your idea of ultimate shopping, I certainly won't be following your reviews.
Because frankly you dress funny, smell funny and sit on chairs with 3 legs.
Otherwise you best be pretty creative and handy to make a find here awesome.
