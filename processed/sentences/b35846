Good prices and great hair cuts/color!

I'm from out of town, walked in here after not having my hair cut in a couple months, talked to Candy, sweet oriental lady who owns the place.
She cut my hair and did a very nice job... And a fair price so I left a decent tip in appreciation for taking me in as a walk in...

Like one of those awesome hole in the wall restaurants- this is your awesome hole in the wall place to get your hair.
Comfortable atmosphere, friendly staff, and all the product you need :)

I've been coming here for years!
Candy is very nice and always takes me in whenever I need a fix, even when I don't have an appointment.
I suggested her to my mother awhile back and she's been a repeat customer as well.
