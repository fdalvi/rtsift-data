I got "Jacked" at this Jack in the Box!
Food is standard Jack fare but the service is slower than a Wisconsin snowbird.
Only  fast food joint in North Scottsdale, though fast in category only.
Oh, and don't plan on going in after 9:30 as they lock it up early.

Was in the area to meet someone and thought I would be able to find a quick bite to eat.....little did I know that this area is like BFE and that there's not much to choose from.
Luckily, I saw the good ol' standby when in a pinch....JITB.
I ordered:  Turkey Bacon Cheddar Sandwich, $4.19 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Rq6WYcNMX8VZohD89LGWaQ?select=USHwj6fMp951mItyKyn0mA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Rq6WYcNMX8VZohD89LGWaQ?select=yNz93hcyNATY5XLlNlQcXQ  Big Cheeseburger, $1.29 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Rq6WYcNMX8VZohD89LGWaQ?select=B9ffEfEnx60oWFPx80_uKw  This was my 1st time trying the Turkey Bacon Cheddar.....thought I would try something "healthier" for a change....umm, not!
The Sandwich was pretty tasty, but damn was it greasy or buttery.....whatever, I felt really guilty after eating that thing.
The Big Cheeseburger was ok....it's my staple grub at JITB.
Overall, the joint was fast and food was cheap.
Not bad.
Return Factor - 50%

The staff treated me okay.
There was a manager that served me breakfast who was WAY chipper for being there so early, but that is kind of a good thing I suppose.
Never been a big fan of JIB's burgers but I like their breakfasts.
Used to be a fan of the Chicken Fajita Pita ... Might I may have to try that again soon when I get a new job.....

Very friendly staff, or a fast food place-- their customer service and friendliness is unmatched..
I go more often than not simply because of the experience every time!
Thanks Micky!
