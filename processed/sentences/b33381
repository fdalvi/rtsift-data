Krista helped me develop a personal branding strategy that almost instantly yielded results.
Although I interviewed three experts for this important assignment, I hired Krista because she took time to get to know me, my industry, and my potential.
It is important for her to do the job right.
She has the keen sense to ask the right questions.
She is a valuable resource who shared gold nuggets of information that are still yielding fruit.
I would recommend her to my family and good friends, and anyone who wanted to gain the competitive edge of being at the head of the pack.
Two thumbs way up!

Krista did an outstanding job creating my resume and cover letter.
She knows the questions to ask to find skills you posses (even ones you don't know you have).
The way she put my resume into words is amazing.
Many of my friends were skeptical about paying to have a resume done but once I showed them the results they were as amazed as I was.
Thank you for a job well done!

Two words- highly recommended!
Krista was able to highlight the strengths in my current field of work so that I was able to transition over to a new line of work.
She was very easy to work with over the phone, which was also very convenient for me due to my hectic schedule.
When my wife is ready I also plan on having Krista work her magic.
Thanks again for a job well done!

Krista Morris, made what I have to say is one of the best resume's I have ever seen.
The resume that was made for me has gotten me three different job interview's in less than a week.
I want to say what an amazing job she did for me and I can only say Thank you.
