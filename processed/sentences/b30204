This is my Sunday bank.
I go for a bike ride and get to the 2/3 spot at this plaza along Charleston Boulevard and Desert Foothills Drive.
When I need to make a quick deposit or withdrawal, this is the branch to which I go.
It was opened during the building boom, but many of the houses didn't follow, so this is often a slow place.
It's easy to get to, there are several other businesses here that makes the whole area a one stop place.
I have found the tellers to be quite competent when I've had to go inside.
But, since this is my Sunday bank, I usually just ride my bike up to the ATM outside, make my withdrawal, and make a fast pedal away with my loot.
Actually, I normally go right next door to the Starbucks in Albertson's.
Like I said,ma one stop place!

I don't have an account here.
I just use the ATM here because it is close to the house and my bank is further down the road.
The ATM does not break down and run out of money, like some ATM's (Bank of America on Towncenter & Charleston).
I should open an account though...ATM Fees.

Great location, as it's tucked away between Charleston and Desert Foothills.
Great for the West Summerlin crowd.
Staff is very friendly.
I'll have to say that the only complaint that I have against this place, and thus the one star from perfect is that the lighting at night is not the best.
Always had to be wary what was on all sides of the vehicle due to not having the usual type of flood lights in a drive-thru ATM situation.
The branch off of Canyon Pointe is lit much better, as a comparison.
