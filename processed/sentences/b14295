Live right next to this place and needed to grab some beer after getting home from the airport.
Usually liquor stores have a somewhat decent beer selection, but this place didn't.
No Blue Moons, no Corona Lights, nothing but the standard Bud, MGD, Coors, and Natty Light.
Skip this place if you're doing a beer run.

This Circle K, minus any gas, is not my favorite convenient store.
Yes, it's definitely convenient for me, being so close to home, still doesn't mean I have to like it tho.
I really wish they would just redo the place.
Its a pretty small Circle K and it could easily be a lot cleaner and not seem like it's falling apart.
The people behind the counter tho are always friendly and each have their own unique (quirky) personalities.

No gas pumps and limited parking.
The staff is nice though.
I prefer stopping by Quick Trip.
