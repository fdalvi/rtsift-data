Jonathan and Olga have been cutting my hair for 7 years.
I always get a great haircut .
I recently moved and still drive the extra 10 miles to their barber shop.
If you are looking for a traditional barber shop in north phoenix this is a great place for a haircut.

So came in and no wait which is rare but after I sat down it started getting busy.
Lucky timing I guess.
Lol I got an amazing fade.
Didn't get the guys name but he has a booth closest to the wall.
They had sports on just for the customer right in front of the cutting station and it was quick and didn't take an hour like some places do and to me it's seems as most places I go to when getting a fade it takes a good 45 minutes.
And it comes out good well this guy did it faster took 15 minutes at the most and dis a better job than my regular barber I used to go to.
This is my new spot and I will be a repeat and return customer.
Very highly recommended!
Definitely a  from me

I have been to this place for about a year now.
I visited 8 other shops closer to my house before going here.
Jonathan is the BEST barber I've been to in 40 years.
He is friendly, professional and FAST, not to mention precise!
I don't have to ask him to keep making adjustments.
He listens to exactly what I want and goes to it.
If he answers a call in the middle, it doesn't slow him down.
Even though I have to drive over 10 miles, I am customer as long as they are open.
Obet is another excellent barber.
Both these guys remember you every time and are fantastic.
