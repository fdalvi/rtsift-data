Pete the water guy is the best.
I've had he and his crew do everything from service my RO system, install a hot water recirculator, water heater, and a hose bib.
Very personable, quality, and the price is right.
I don't like to pay too much but I've paid too little and that really cost me.
You get both quality and value with Soft Water Plus.

I have trusted these guys with my water treatment needs originally moving to Anthem, AZ in 2001.
They installed a reverse osmosis unit as well as a water softener and replaced the original water heater after the original one decided to die on us.
They have also done other various plumbing services including installing a hot water recirculating pump which I absolutely love the benefits.
All the products they have installed have performed very well and the level of service and attention to detail is unmatched.

I've had Pete come to our house in Anthem twice.
The first time was to disconnect our expensive water heater when we moved then to reconnect it (along with a new valve for car washing) in the new house.
He was on time, had the parts the job needed and cleaned up afterward (that's actually a bigger deal than it sounds).
The second time was to change our RO filters.
At the same time, he asked if I wanted him to flush the water heater (no charge).
Wow.
I couldn't ask for better service.
Great prices too.
Boom!
