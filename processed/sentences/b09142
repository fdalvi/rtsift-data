Even though the name says, "Senior Center", this is a multi-purpose facility with a tremendous amount of amenities for everyone of all ages.
Some of the amenities include, baseball field, basket ball court, playground, swimming pool, and a workout gym.
You will find that this facility is great for meetings because it has a couple classrooms with tables, chairs and white boards.
I would assume there are over head projectors and screens.
There is a large multi-purpose room in the back that has a foyer that could be used for a large meeting that required a setup just outside of the room, ie registration or packet pick-up.
There are a variety of activity rooms.
There is also a youth activity room with hang out area, pool, cubbies and TV.
The welcome desk is staffed and on a Saturday, there was more than one person working the desk.
Really, there's nothing senior about this multi-generational facility.
People of all ages can find something to do here.
