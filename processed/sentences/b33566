I am very fortunate to have Jeff taking care of my car.
He personally addresses all of my automotive concerns and takes time to explain everything that will be done to my vehicle.
He suggested a wonderful synthetic oil that gives me 8 more mpg and protects my engine better than the fossil oil.
Low tires, low fluids he's always there for me with a smile and good advice.

I have been going to Jeff for almost about 10 years..He is the best around..most auto places rip you off,take forever and bs you..here that won't happen he gives the most fair prices around and does the best job timely and efficent... if u have any vehicle problems dont go anywhere else...

JD's Automotive has been my preferred mechanic for several years.
I've went to other shops due to convenience and always end right back at Jeff's shop.
I've referred many friends to him and ALL of them are now regular customers.
Highly recommend - honest mechanic's are hard to find but I assure you, Jeff and crew will take care of you and your vehicle.

Both JD &   Jeff are honest straightforward men who stand behind their work.
If you need to hear it from me to believe, feel to give me a call.

Straight forward and honest.
He could've charged me for a new steering box but was able to just adjust it.
No need in replacing.
Awesome service and quick.
