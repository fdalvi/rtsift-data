I've been seeing the semi-desperate "give us another try!
We don't stink anymore!
" Domino's commercials for months.
Finally, a Groupon made me and the S.O.
bite.
As in, we TOOK one bite and let the kids polish off the rest.
Nothing against this location in particular, but this is exactly how I remember the Domino's of yore:  greasy and tasteless.
I really don't know how this chain is still in business.
Save your money.
Bleargh.

My order was good and delivered on time.
I also liked the Domino's tracker online with animation.

I posted this on Facebook.
It pretty much sums up my feelings of Dominos.
Dont get me wrong.
I like the sandwichs and the wings.
Its just the pizza.
Its like a soup with uncooked dough.
So...
I order a pizza from you guys.
Medium (12") Handmade Pan Pizza Whole: Extra Cheese, Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Light Robust Inspired Tomato Sauce  Every third time it may actually be cooked in the middle.
But most times it is not.
Seriously if I wanted uncooked dough.
I would order that.
Its nasty and tastes like ass.
The worst part is I get to be the jerk who calls in to complain.
Its not hey man you messed up and didn't cook my zah.
Its yes once again you didn't cook my zah.
So I get to wonder what extra ingredients your now putting on my pizza cause I asked you to remake it.
Its not like I don't tip well.
I am nice to your drivers.
So its not like I am a problem customer.
Only when you fail to cook or quality check my pizza.
Honestly, if it looks like a soup in the middle.... something is wrong.

I will never order Pizza from Dominos again.
The replacement pizza was a little better.
Till I got to the half that was not cooked.
Nothing better then a pizza with good toppings, bottom of the dough cooked and the middle uncooked.
How is this even possible.
Who cares.
I suggest you do not order from this place.
