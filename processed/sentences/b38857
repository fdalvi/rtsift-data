Great store, very bright and well organized.
The products are just amazing and the staff is very knowledgeable and helpful.
Love the cooking demos they do and the fact that I'm always greeted with a warm welcome.

Went to this store after the Anthem store closed.
I always look at the clearance items to see if they have anything I need.
I always seem to find something new and interesting to use.
Love the quality of all the products.
