Great bunch of folks.
All the Scottish dress and pipe supplies that you need.

We ordered from Claymore's web presence, KiltRentalUSA, for the kilts for the men of our wedding party.
As they were all travelling from Scotland and kilts way a TON, it was rather impractical to rent the tartan we wanted and have them carry over.
Also, for the length of travel time, it would be insanely expensive.
Enter kilts from Arizona!
Who knew?
They provided not only the rental kilts for the men (of which all but one fit perfectly), but I also ordered a necktie and some tartan fabric ahead of time for a little girl's dress + accessory-making.
The shipping on that order was exorbitant, but the kilt order was great and we had no complaints.
This place has a larger selection of tartans for rental kilts than anywhere in Central or Eastern Scotland (believe me, I looked in person!
) and the pricing for the service is competitive with what we're used to paying in the UK.
While my now-husband owns his own kilt, it was great to have the wedding party in a similar style and with the right tartan.
Very good service!

This place is awesome.
They do the majority of their business online, but if you are in the area and need to rent a kilt you can stop in to try things on.
The wedding party rented their kilts here and we were so impressed with the service.
My husband stopped in one day to get the items set up and the rest of the wedding party was able to place their order on the phone.
They were easy to work with and the kilts made the wedding!!

I can't say enough good things about the folks at Claymore / kiltrentalusa.
In brief, I needed a formal kilt on short notice for my nephew's wedding.
The guys walked me through the process and delivered as promised.
They didn't have the tartan I wanted available for rental, but we found a very similar substitute.
I had already decided to order my own kilt in my family tartan and it was delivered today precisely when and as  it was promised.
