I let my hair grow out and needed it trimmed up bad before my wedding.
Jamal (aka  Texas) hooked me up with the fresh fade and now I'm looking good.
This is a black barber shop that will take care of your hair cut needs.
Domino games going on while you wait.
That's what I'm talking 'bout!

I took my sons here for their first barber shop haircut.
The staff is very courteous and welcoming.
They got my sons in and out quickly and hooked up their heads.
It was the BEST initiation into the black barber shop experience that my young black men in training could have possibly had!

Ever since my Barber has moved away I met a Barber from there.
Tried it for the first time and I am extremely happy with the cut.
The Barber had cut it the way I wanted and was by far the cleanest fade I ever gotten.
Very satisfied.
Tell you one thing is walking in there is just like the movie Barbershop.
Very entertaining and fun atmosphere.
Sports talk, clowning and the whole nine yard.
When I was leaving there was a lady cooking some chicken wings outside.
Since I was hungry I had to place an order.
Let me tell you one thing that fried chicken wing soooo good.
Overall great place!

My personal barber is here.
Everyone here is very friendly and you just feel like you're at home.
Got a nice fade by Abee (His shirt says B-RoC) on it.
Been cutting my hair for the last 15 years and has always done a great job so never had any complaints.
They also have these lovely ladies that sell some pretty good food while you're waiting or just hanging out.
