Best spray tan ever!
I'm so pasty white and my glow was so natural and very even never came off spotty.
I'm so impressed.
She said she uses the best bronzing agents!
Couldn't be happier:) Thank you Denise!

I am a repeat customer at D's Spray Tanning because it is so AMAZING!
The tan really does last 7 days just like I was told.
The tanning space is very clean and Denise makes the tan look so natural and even.
I have been getting spray tanned for years and once I found this place I haven't gone anywhere else.
If you are looking for a longlasting, natural looking tan then make your appointment!
Thanks for keeping me glowing!

Denise is great.
I felt super comfortable and the product she uses is the best (that I have experienced).
I was pleasantly surprised.
I have found my new spray tanning gal!
