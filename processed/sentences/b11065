Went to Bakery King this morning for donuts.
They were perfect donuts.
Substantial and tender, not too sweet, and pretty big.
They are like 1.5 times normal-size donuts.
I got a vanilla iced donut, it was great.
But, they have quite possibly the best boston cream donut I've ever had (well, my husbad had and I stole.
) Not too sweet filling that tasted homemade with real ingredients, with not too strong/fake chocolatey frosting, it was perfect.
I hate boston cream donuts, but their's is fantastic.
And it was cheap - it was like $3.50 for 3 big donuts.
Kind of confusing store front, didn't seem like they were geared towards the individual customer, with no tables and gas station-style coffee machine, sugar packets, non-dairy creamer - we passed.
I should be glad they didn't have an espresso machine or fancier coffees, otherwise I'd probably have donuts from here for breakfast for the rest of my life.
Conclusion: Get donuts from here.
Grab coffee from Sunrise just down the street.
But definitely get donuts from here.

The doughnuts were great!
The wonderful lady that assisted me was  very kind!

This commercial bakery was recently relocated and, in the process, opened a small retail outlet.
The long established commercial side of the bakery supplies Mandalay Bay, Luxor and Hilton Grand Vacations with baked goods, but it seems the retail end was an after thought as it is poorly set up with no tables and only a few upholstered chairs.
A special of a coffee and choice of any baked good was being offered for $1.50.
I don't drink coffee or tea so I was planning on ordering just a donut, but the clerk said she could substitute milk.
We ended up sharing a cheese Danish and old fashioned donut with both being pretty ordinary

Tried to go here this morning with directions from GoogleMaps and it was nowhere to be found...I drove around the parking lot for 10 mins looking...maybe I missed it??
Not sure how thats possible...
