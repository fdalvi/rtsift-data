Beware!!!
We took our dogs to this animal hospital for a few months, it was good at first until all of the doctors started leaving and the new ones were terrible.
The new doctors were not personable and seemed to not really care about the dogs or us.
We boarded our dogs there for a holiday weekend and spent almost $300 to have them cared for, fed, walked, and also bathed.
When we returned our dogs were given back to us covered in feces and shaking, the person who brought them out to us said "I wouldnt want them in my car, good luck", and walked away.
Also their toys and blankets they promised us they would have were returned to us in a plastic bag still brand new and smelling of laundry detergent so they never got to have them.
I called the director of the hospital and talked with him about the situation and he basically told me that they did me a favor watching my dogs and that we should be happy about that.
It took several conversations and me threatening to contact animal control and the bbb before he refunded us our money.
The dogs were traumatized for about a week before they were themselves again.
STAY AWAY FROM HERE!!!!!

We've been coming here for a month and a half since this was recommended by a friend and its fairly close to home.
Our dog had been having seizures and since it was a Sunday, this was one of the many places that was open.
We had Dr. Meaux  and he seemed very knowledgable about dogs with seizures.
He took a lot of time to explain the different scenarios that we could do for treatment and he just listened to our concerns.
He called a couple days later to check on the dog.
I've taken the dog back for a nail trim and their  prices are very resonable.
We had to take in the boyfriend's family dog  for a full set of vaccines yesterday and the total came out to be under 50 bucks with a dr. exam.
I give them 5 stars for their reasonable prices and their customer service!

We have 3 cats , office staff always ask if we've been helped.
Dr's always have follow up calls , best of all prices seem resonably

I took both of my dogs here for some of their shots &  check ups and the staff has always been great.
The prices are cheaper than previous vets I have gone too.
When my friend brought her boy dog over for a little he got a little too close to my dog & decided to mate, before I decided to get her fixed.
I was not planning on breeding her, but when I took her to this vet they talked me through everything & gave me some tips on things to do to help my dog stay healthy while nursing.
When she had the puppies one of them was too small & they helped me do everything I could to help the puppy survive.
I don't have one complaint about them, besides the fact that they couldn't move to Henderson with me!

I moved to the West side of the city about a year ago, and I've been taking my dog here since then.
Their hours are very accommodating for those of us that work standard Monday-Friday 9a-5p jobs, which I appreciate so I don't have to take a work day off or take a weekend day to get a vet visit in (though I will if it comes down to it!).
My dog has gone in for shots, for diagnostics when I had a minor nervous breakdown about cherry eye (I'm good now, no worries), and my dog is going in for a dental cleaning later this month.
Great vets, great staff, great hours.

Durango Animal Hospital is fantastic.
The facility is clean, the office staff are friendly, personable and nice.
The Dr.s are very knowledgeable, patient, and a pleasure to work with.
Great place!

This place is great.
We tried a "cat" specialist first, but was very disappointed, so we tried Durango and have been happy very since.
My 21y/o finally passed from old age and complications of a tumor.
They were helpful with his finally care.
Then came our shelter cat that brought to the house the shelter virus, we went to Durango for his care and then the subsequent care of our other cat.
They are very compassionate and take their time to make follow up calls.
They send reminder post cards for their vaccines and teeth cleaning appointments.
And the prices seem to be reasonable compared to the other place we had tried.
Now they have a cute web site that allows you to post your pets photo's and check on their records.
Just a great animal hospital.

I use to come here years ago when my old dogs were still around, then came back after I got my new pup Jelly Bean.
The doctors are all nice and informative.
I never ask for one in particular because I've never had an issue with any of them.
Awhile back my dog got ran over by an SUV and I rushed her over to the hospital where they stabilized and kept her until it was time for her scheduled surgery, which was four days later.
They allowed me to visit her everyday and assured me that they giving her the best care possible.
After Jelly was signed out from the hospital, the doctor in charge of her just gave me call to see about her condition--which she didn't have to do but it showed they really cared for her.
Usually appointments aren't necessary, but I would call just in case you don't want to wait.
They do accept walk-ins!
During February their doing consulting for teeth cleaning where they offer a discount between $30-60, depending the health of your dog or cats teeth.
Extremely professional and informative individuals.
I recommend this hospital to anyone.

We had to put our dog down and they were very professional and made the decision easier.
I highly recommend them.
Dr B is a great vet

I moved to Long beach about a yr ago, I go out of my way to take my pup to this animal hospital, except for emergencies...  out of all the vets I've taken him their the nicest, most informative, and I loooove how they remember his name whenever he comes in.
I also like,unlike other hospitals, that you don't really need to stick to one vet they're ALL amazing and they always make sure there's not a question left unasked and unanswered.

When we first moved to town 4 years ago, we took our dogs to Durango Animal Hospital.
The only reason we left was because the bill was always way more than they had told us originally, and it happened every time.
After the Aloha Animal Hospital nightmare, we decided to return to Durango Animal Hospital.
I guess we can live with the bill always being way more than we are told, as long as they take good care of our dogs.

I have been meaning to write this review for awhile but kept forgetting.
Taking my Rocky to them this morning reminded me how awesome everyone there is!
I first found Durango Animal Hospital because I woke up one Sunday morning and Rocky was not behaving like his normal self.
He was really lethargic, and didn't even want to go on his walk!
This was definitely not like him.
When I tried to pick him up (hes only 15 lbs), he yelped like he was in pain so I knew I had to find a vet and take him in.
I searched on yelp for a vet that was open on Sunday's and found them!
I called in first and they said to bring him in anytime.
I adopted Rocky and he is deathly afraid of men, so I was a little worried because they only had 2 male vets working that day.
Knowing he was sick, I took the risk, and I'm glad I did.
He saw Dr. B. and he was very gentle with him.
They ran some tests and we realized that he just must have eaten something bad that was giving him a tummy ache.
So I took him home and watched to make sure he would get better within 24 hours.
Dr. B personally called me the next day to see how Rocky was doing too.
That call sealed the deal!!
I love that personal touch, and made me realize that they really cared about how their pet patients were doing.
When I had to take him in to get shots, I was so impressed by their personal care, I bought him back (even though its pretty far from my house).
I saw Dr. B. again, and Rocky even licked and let him pet him!
This was a first.
We were in and out of there so quickly which is a plus for this Puppy Momma on the run!
I had to take him in again this morning for a set of different shots.
Dr. B. was off, so we saw someone else.
This time Rocky was a little cranky and would let the vet touch him, but he sent in a female tech to assist him.
Once again, they were fast and efficient!
I took out my phone to tweet, and before I could even type, they were bringing Rocky back in saying he was all set!
I love it!
The girls in the front are all so nice and personal too.
I really can't say enough about the great service they provide here.
They truly care about the well being of your puppy, and that means a lot!

they are so kind and caring

Took my 15 year old mutt in to be neutered.
I have tried Town Center Animal Hospital, West Flamingo ( my favorite vet left town), and VCA in the past.
None of those places matched the care I was use to in Southern California.
I went in very skeptical, and scared for my baby who needed this surgery.
To my delight, I found a great vet, Dr McDermott, and a great staff.
They were caring, patient, and not too expensive.
$250 for neutering, teeth cleaning ( i think it was a special),  pain pills, and a cone.
My dog is now acting like he did 5years ago, no issues, no problems with the surgery.
Thank You Durango Animal Hospital!!!!
On another note, West Flamingo AH does have a terrific cancer care vet- Dr Macy.

Friendly staff.
They accept walk ins.
Informative staff.
Will answer all your questions.

Time to take my kitties for their check up and vaccines.
This month they were offering a free check up and I made out paying only for vaccines for three!
I love the quick service, the confidence of the staff and the way they handle the animals.
They continue to offer great service, the web site is interactive, and if "liked" you'll get updated specials.

We have been bringing our dogs here for years.
Dr C. operated on our dog's hip a few years ago.
We have always been happy with the doctors.
Today we took our dogs in for shots.
We had an appointment but had to wait almost a half hour in a room with our dogs getting more and more nervous.
When my husband went out to ask how  much longer it would be he got a very snotty "We"ll get to you when we get to you!
"  When he asked how the sequence of who gets seen first worked, she was even ruder.
I heard the way she was talking to my husband from the room and nicely asked for our dog's records.
We will be finding a new animal hospital.
They acted like they sure don't need out business.
Very sad!
I'm sure the doctors won't even know their staff drives away long-time customers.
Look elsewhere for good customer service.

I hate to say it, but we did not have a good experience here.
A while back, our Bengal cat was acting pretty strange.
I don't know how to explain it, but he was meowing like crazy, seemed to be in pain, and would lose balance when trying to walk.
The two vet hospitals that I usually go to were closed, so I came here because it was close to my home and they were still open that evening.
Yes, the one thing I do like about this place is that they are open 7 days a week and close at 8pm on weekdays.
I called ahead of time and they were nice enough to tell me to come in right away.
The first doctor that we saw said that our cat had glaucoma, and I was sent home with 2 small, expensive bottles of eye drops.
We came back a few days later for a follow up.
We were set up with another doctor since the one we saw previously wasn't working that day.
This doctor said that it could be "something else" and its possible that he doesn't have glaucoma.
He ordered a bunch of tests - blood work, x-rays and a few other ones.
Of course we had agreed because we were very concerned about our baby.
We even agreed to have him stay at the hospital for a few nights, hoping that the doctors would monitor him and find out what was wrong.
When the test results came back, they basically told us that everything looked good, but because they knew something was wrong and did not know what it was, we got referred to a specialist.
So we took him to the doctors at the veterinary neurological center.
I won't even mention how much we spent there, but at least they gave us some answers.
Our cat had a really bad ear infection.
Which explained why he was walking funny and had high eye pressures.
Anyway, what I cannot understand is why the doctors at Durango could not figure out that he had a ear infection.
I mean, isn't that one of the more common problems that they would see?
Another odd thing is that the doctor at the neurological center explained that surgery would be a good option.
They called the doctors at Durango and asked if they could perform this type of surgery and of course answered that they were not comfortable with doing it.
So we got referred to another specialist.
It makes me wonder if the doctors here really did know that our cat had a bad ear infection, but because they did not want to do a surgery, they decided not to deal with it and sent us to another doctor.
I guess I'll never know, but one thing is for sure, I won't be returning.

On February 12th, 2013 my 14 1/2 year old dog  passed away.
Dr. McDermott at Durango Animal Hospital did everything that he could for her.
In the toughest of times, he is a very compassionate and understanding Dr.  We could not have asked for more.
I will pay what ever it is, I know I was upset with them at one point because the bills are always higher than quoted, but now I realize that her having the best care was priceless.
Money doesn't matter, only your beloved matters.
We have an eight year old too,  I will not let him be seen by anyone other Dr. McDermott.

Dr. Christopher Schneider is the best!
He's very informative and answers all your questions.
He doesn't try to rush you so that he can get to the next appointment.
If he doesn't know the answer, then he will refer to someone who will.
For example, my dog was having serious eye ulcer problems, and the medicine that we were using wasn't enough.
So he referred me to Las Vegas Veterinary Hospital where his eye ulcers where taken care of.
My dog also has regular issues like skin problems, ear, and anal glands problems.
Dr, Schneider is always nice and treats my dog with care.
Dr. Schneider has been my dog's doctor for more than half of his life.
I recommend seeing him as your pet's doctor.

I have finally found a match for my precious babies!
Dr. Christensen was the most thorough, caring, and professional Veterinarian I have encountered in the last decade.
Our sweet brindle boxer Lilly, had a cancerous tumor removed from her paw.
Never once did I feel as if he was pushing surgery to nickle and dime us as some Vets do.
Lilly had a successful surgery.
She had growths, tumors and and a teeth cleaning all in one shot.
I must also mention that the total cost of service was extremely reasonable!
The proof of Dr. Christensen's attentive and loving nature towards animals came when we took Lilly in for her regular bandage changes.
She felt calm and ease even when we knew she was sore.
I could not be happier with the service we received, even though the news of cancer was not the best.
Also, thumbs up to the front office staff.
Thank you for loving and caring for our baby!!!

We brought our Doberman Greta here for 10 years.
She had tumors on her spine and could no longer walk.
As hard as it was we decided to end her suffering and pain.
The Vet on staff explained the process carefully to us.
They allowed us to stay with Greta during the procedure and gave us the privacy and the time we needed to say goodbye.
They were so respectful.
Over the 10 years We had  a chance to interact with many of the doctors and staff and never had a negative experience.
Even when things were busy they always took the time to answer any questions and address any concerns.
We just added a new 8 week old Chocolate Lab "Riley" to our family and will be trusting his care to the doctors and staff at Durango Animal Hospital.

On Tuesday April 30, 2013.
I took my precious  little Shih Tzu to this new Vet.
Dr. Bradley Christensen at Durango Animal Hospital at 3615 South Durango Drive.
Las Vegas NV.
Before going there, for a  few days my Shih Tzu, was limping on her right hind leg and also had a slightly swollen nipple.
The staff at that office was nice.
The place was clean.
They charged me $202.46.
I'm not really complaining about that.
Even though that Bill was obviously padded.
However, I realize every Vet has to make money and their time is valuable.
I also made it quite clear to that Vet Dr. C,  that I am a Retired Senior.
But, Dr. Christensen spent most of the time giving me a very expensive "SALES PITCH" while explaining, how necessary it was for my Shih Tzu to have this "Very Expensive Surgery" to remove her slightly swollen nipple ASAP.
He even said, it could be Cancerous and spread throught out her body.etc.etc., Exaggerating everything.
The following day Wednesday, after speaking to all my good friends near and far.
I decided to get a second opinion, from a Very Experienced, Honest and Trustworthy Veterinarian.
I was quite surprised when he advised me, not to put my Pet through this ridiculously priced, unnecessary surgery right away, which Dr. Christensen said would be at least between $400 To $500.
Instead, I now received Honest, Good, reasonable priced Advise, to first try a warm moist towel on my Shih Tzu's slightly swollen nipple four to five times a day.
Which I immediately did and fortunately, the slight swelling has all disappeared.
"NO THANKS" TO Dr. Christensen?
My Pet is again back to normal and feeling fine.
Even Dr. C's overpriced 6 Dramadol 50 mg. Tablets were not necessary.
Because, one single dose of coated baby Aspirin tablet I had already given her the day before I brought her in had already helped her with the Hip and Leg problem.
This certainly is an erroneous manner taking advantage of unsuspecting Seniors.
Just because we all love our "Dear Pets" and will blindly spend any amount to save them.
What ever happened to Durango Animal Hospital "MOTTO"?????????????????????
"Your Other Family Doctor"???????????????
This is quite an "Unusual Experience".
My other Doctors here would never, ever try to do unecessary surgery for financial gain.
At Durango Animal Hospital,   they can Fool Some of the People Some of the time.
But, not all of the People all of the time.
" PEOPLE BEWARE"

My favorite vet is no longer here, but I still connected with Dr. McDermitt.
He and his staff provide excellent care of my cats.
They seem very busy however, and it pays to be patient, they have a huge amount of employees, but the number of pets coming in the door, it's overwhelming.
The appointment was on time, the care performed was excellent, and they called to update and arrange for pick up time.
Services are excellent, staff excellent, good place for veterinary care.

Update:  Now there are a bunch of new doctors here...Dr. Christopher Schneider was my go to doctor and he is not there anymore.. he left to cali :(   :(   So now I see Dr. McDermott.
He is one the original doctors still there.
Dr Schneider said that he is leaving me in good hands with Dr. McDermott.
He's very professional and gives great advice and information.
Also, I give my dog a vegan diet and he's open to that idea and not condescending.
So I recommend seeing Dr. McDermott.

I have been going to this vet office for 5 years.
The service and prices are unbeatable!!!
I will go nowhere else with my dog.
They do not just want to take your money like most places, they truly care about your animals and their well being.
:) HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!
Love all of the vets I've met with thus far.

I have spent a lot of time at Durango AH lately and I have come to respect the doctors and staff a great deal.
My dog had to come in after a pit bull attacked him and they were there to attend to him immediately and were great on follow-up visits.
I also bring my cat there and trust them for boarding if I have to go out of town.
I wouldn't think of going anywhere else.

Today was my first visit to Durango Animal Hospital and I it was a really great experience.
From the time I walked in till the time I left, nothing but great customer service.
I never had a new born puppy, and Allyson was very informative and answered all of my concerns.
I'm so glad my friend recommended me to Durango Animal Hospital.
If you're looking for a place with affordable rates and great service, stop in and see why Durango Animal Hospital is the best.

From the front office to the back treatment area everything was great.
Dr Christensen came in on a Saturday night at 10:00 pm because my Boxer became very ill. We did have to put Zeppelin to sleep, and while it was heartbreaking, Dr Christensen did everything possible to make us feel comfortable with our decision and he was incredibly compassionate and kind.
I have been to many Vets in my past but I can honestly say this group really has it together.
The services are priced more than fair everything is exceptionally clean and everyone has been professional, friendly and kind.
They will be taking care of my animals for years to come.
Once again thank you all for awesome service    Mari Lifrieri

After reading numerous reviews on Yelp, trying to find the best local vet for my 8 week old Airedale puppy, I came across Durango Animal Hospital.
The reviews looked good so I decided to go in and check it out.
Great location, very clean, and the staff was great!
Yay I found a vet for my Atlas!
We returned a few days later for our appointment.
We were seen promptly and Dr. McDermott was so nice!
Atlas loved it too and was very comfortable.
We will definitely be coming back here for many years to come!

Had a great second visit!
We even got a room with a beautiful fish tank!
The wait wasn't bad and everyone was very nice again.
We love our visits to the vet.

Love this place.
I bring my english bulldog here.
Just left and it's a Sunday, because they have great hours.
'Fudge' has mites (gross).
The doctor was so cool they let me go in back and see the disgusting parasites under the scope feasting on my boys back!!
Whatever it was awesome and they are really good to my boy!

Update, they did not charge me for the extra night, which was the right thing to do, although I was surprised when I picked them up to find that there was a mandatory $20 fecal exam for each dog - which I understand, I just would like for it to not be a surprise charge.
Again, they do a GREAT job as a vet, I just wish they had a better system to giving you the information you need and charges you are going to incur beforehand so it isn't a surprise .
There's a lot of information to give, maybe a one sheet a the time you drop off your dogs would be good and cover everything?
___ Original Review: I want to like this place, as a vet and price wise they are good so far, but with respect to the front desk staff there is something to be desired.
I told them when they were dropped off that I was picking my dogs up from boarding tonight around 7:30, no one ever said "we are only open until 5pm", they said there was someone with them 24 hours.
I've now driven 45 minute each way out of my way only to find that my dogs have to spend the night again (the technician is "locked inside") and I can pick them up at 6am and have to pay for an additional night of boarding.
Not to mention my dogs had surgery and I'm sure are very scared and just want to be home, which is the worst part.

Usually they're good.
Not today that's for sure.
So irritated.
Long story short my dog goes in once a week for a mite bath.
Last week it was $48, this week it was $50.
It's the principal.
I also wanted them to cut his nails today.
They say they did but I know they didn't, they look exactly the same.
Had receptionist confirm they were cut, came back saying they did but since the quick was so long...ok, if the quick is so long why cut them at all?
I'm well aware of the quick btw.
Why not wait until next time when they've grown a little more rather than charge me for doing nothing.
Makes no sense.
I wanted them to take him back and cut them again.
If I'm not happy with something make it right.
Nope, I paid and now I'm pissed.
Lastly nobody calls me to tell me they're done with the dog.
I have to call them.
Usually atleast twice.
First time they left me on hold so long I hung up.
I don't know what their problem was today but what a disappointment.

Not to happy after I picked up my babies.
We let them board here over the weekend.
We got the nail trim and courtesy bathe.
When I picked them up they looked so nice and clean.
But when we got home I notice they smelled like pee and there was dry poop on one of my babies back.
My other baby had dry poop near his butt.
I'm not even sure if they trim my dogs nails it's all filthy.
So I just had to give them a bath Myself.
I thought about it....
I'm pretty sure this is this the last time I'm bringing them here.
This is the 3rd time my Babies came out like this.
I must say I back then in 2007-2011 this place was great.
Now not so great.
Sorry!

We brought my step daughter's dog in for a check-up.
The Doctor was very professional, and accurately assessed that her dog was likely suffering from cancer, but took some samples for testing.
The samples ended up being positive and we had to put our buddy down.
The staff and doctor were incredibly sensitive and compassionate.
The cremation services were very convenient and the sympathy card was enough to bring tears to the eyes of all.
We sincerely appreciate their handling of a difficult moment in our life and will be using them for our other animals when needed.
Thank you Durango!
