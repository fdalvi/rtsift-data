This isn't a bad place to go and get a beer and some grub.
Although I'm not really sure why it's categorized under pizza (Since pizza isn't even on the menu) The menu consists mainly of burgers wings and sandwiches  The prices are reasonable  Staff seems friendly  The decor looks like every guys idea of a bar in his garage  I'll definitely be back again

RJ's surprised me when we walked in!
I was expecting it to be far more of a dive!
It's actually quite nice with tables, a bar, and a back area with games and sometimes live music.
It's pretty loud at times, and nothing really fancy about the big open room.
They only had wine one of four times we were here, but I guess that's to be expected.
I figure they could at least keep some of those tiny screw cap bottles for when people request.
I settle for beer, which is averagely priced.
The service is friendly enough and pretty fast considering the bartender always seems to be the server for the entire place.
The food here is surprisingly really good!
I get grilled cheese, which honestly is one of the best in the Valley.
All of the food looks good.
It's cheap in price and comes in a basket.
RJ's is a fine little stop in.
I upped the rating due to the food.
No patio here... Just a back door with 2 broken plastic chairs and a dumpster.

99c breakfast - sat/sun 9:00am-11:00am, with purchase of drink.
Tasty,quick n good.
In and out for less than 3$.

RJ's has closed and is now Over Under Sports Grill.
New ownership, spiffed up interior, new menu.
