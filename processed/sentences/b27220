Overall I loved this spa.
The massage itself was great - I had Alysa.
Loved:  - The robes - ahhhhhh - The massage - The grounds and area - gorgeous - The service - very nice people    Just ok:  - No private spa pool - No major separate spa area

Above average services are given here.
Roxanne gives an amazing facial.
The lockers/amenities are clean and refreshing.
Service rooms are quiet and serene.
Love the added touch of a chocolate strawberry at the end of each service.
Friendly staff.
Recommend.
Stay for a bite at Proof!
