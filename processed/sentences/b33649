We love everything about Double D's!
Saving a ton of money on better cigarettes while patronizing a local business, instead of supporting a big evil corporation!
It's a no brainer.
Also it's a laid back place and the staff rocks.
They are so friendly and helpful.
I would recommend this place to anyone who smokes.

Love this place!!
Been going here almost 2 years now!!
Great service, tobacco, and atmosphere!!
Can't beat the prices!!!
Highly recommend giving this place a try...once you do, you'll never go anywhere else for your cigarettes!!

I like this place, but I moved to Los Angeles now, and I was trying to find out the name of the tobacco I used here, so I could try and find it in Los Angeles.
Los Angeles has RYO shops to but I got a carton from one of them and they are making me cough, and throat itch, basically making me sick.
But I have smoked cartons from this shop and never got sick, so the other place in LA must be selling bad tobacco, I was going to get the name of the tobacco I get from here, and find it here in LA but there number doesn't work when I call it.
Anyone know how to get in contact with them?
They told me they don't have one in LA, but I could call in to order some but IDK how when there number doesn't work.
If someone knows a working number to this place send me a message.
PLZ thanks.
THey let you smoke in the shop and try out cigs before you buy cartons and they usually let you get a drink for free when you go in there which is pretty cool.
I like this place, they should open one in Los Angeles.
