We've been coming here for a couple years.
It's clean, the staff knows us here.
I noticed they did some remodeling, and it's for the best.
I was here to use my $10 dining credit and our server was Nicole.
She's really nice and I always know we're in good hands if she's our server.
This is a great family run business and to my surprise I don't think I've ever ordered a desert here.
Today was the day, I and a friend both got the Chocolate Bunt cake.
It was served hot, and delicious but I honestly couldn't finish it.

My family and i love this place.
They always honor active and veteran military,  which is big plus for our family
