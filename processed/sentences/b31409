We got our 8 m/o female chihuahua mix at the end of December and our year old male pit bull from the Humane Society in March, so this was the first time they had been left alone for the weekend.
Beth was great!
I called her on a Wednesday, we set up a home visit on Thursday and she met with our two dogs.
They took right to her and she observed how they normally interact.
She had lots of forms for me to fill out about eating, playing, and bedtimes.
We left late Friday night, so her first visit was for Saturday AM.
I received a progress report from her on Saturday morning that the dogs were doing great.
She came back on Saturday evening to feed them and put them in their kennels and then again on Sunday AM.
She asked that I let her know when I got home so she knew the dogs were OK.  She left a report on how they did and a little gift for the dogs.
I think they got more attention from Beth then they do from us!
All in all, I would definitely recommend Whiskers & Wings and will use Beth again in the future!

I have several cats and normally when people come over they run for cover!
From the minute Beth walked in they were in her lap, rubbing her legs and very content.
Not only was I happy with Beth so were my cats!
