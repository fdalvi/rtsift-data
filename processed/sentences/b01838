This Mexican restaurant offers good eatin' on the cheap.
Located in a busy strip mall (as a detached building) in a busy stretch of South Central Avenue near Broadway, it was recommended by a Mexican friend who described it as being "closest to Mexican home cooking as it can get, for a restaurant.
" I enjoyed eating in this place because it is spacious for its size, a large illustrated menu hovers over the counter, the prices are low, the food is savory - the vinegar, cilantro, and other seasonings stand out without being overpowering - and they have great flan!
Sure to be a preferred dining stop during my trips to the areas south of downtown.

Best carne asada burritos this side of town.
The ladies are nice.
The place is not the fanciest but it's always clean.
The prices are fair.

Tried this lil diamond in the rough by accident.
You see, Dos Molinos was closed and I needed authentic Mexican fare in my belly.

Had seafood soup and it was superb.
Try that w/a cold Modelo (can) w/a lot of limes and it shouldn't disappoint!
Plus, loved ordering in Spanish - felt in made my food even tastier.
