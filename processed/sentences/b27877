These ppl don't even deserve a star...first off I was ignored walking in I literally had to call them on the phone to get their attention and get some help...2nd Idk if one of the cashiers was touching the food I hope she wasn't she was wearing gloves n scratching her head with them n touching money with them...eeww...n to top it off I found a hair baked into my pizza...these ppl are rude n disgusting!!

Pepperoni, bacon and buttercheese crust.... yuuuummmy!
lol.
Hungry Howies is by far my favorite pizza place of ALL times!
food is ready within 15 minutes for pick up... and i live 10 mins away so it works out great each time!
Always ready on time!

My number one pizza, for sure.
The Pepperoni is always slightly crisp around the edges, which I freakin' love.
The sauce is wonderfully flavorful and the cheese is nice and stretchy.
Butter cheese crust is quite delicious as well.
AND they always have hella cheap specials, like a large for 7 bucks.
I wish to God there was more locations!
Can't recommend enough!!

I've had good and bad experiences with Hungry Howies in California, but i decided to give this one a try.didn't feel like the usual Papa John's so i went ahead and ordered online.while not as flashy and awesome as Domino's online ordering, it's simple to use.had a large half mushroom-half black olive pizza with a ranch crust.if you are trying the flavor crust for the 1st time, i recommend you go with the thin crust as the regular one kinda gets soggy after they apply the flavor juices to it.my only beef was the delivery time.1 hour delivery time on a Monday afternoon is shit.this might have had something to do with the online ordering, i dunno.next time, i won't be so lazy and just call them up.

I have to say i LOVE the pizza but was Very disapointed in the "boneless wings" aka Chicken nuggets that you dip in bbq sauce... Now on the other hand the traditional bone-in wings were awesome and I usually dont like them... the price is great $5 for a lg one topping and get to choose your flavorof crust!!!
YUMMMMMO

I work 1 mile from their cut off delivery point and they refused to bring my order AFTER I had already placed the order online and paid for it.
I had to cancel the order.
The lady on the phone was really rude when she called me.

I never would have tried this place if they were not running a great special.
I take my dogs to the groomer at Clip N Tails, and I also get my haircut at Port.
I noticed that so many people had pizza boxes from this place, and when I got in my car, I saw their banner ad for $5, one topping, large pizza, and of course I made a mental note.
Come the weekend, and I don't want to cook lunch, I called for a takeout order.
I was going to order online, but I did not find the special prices online.
Their regular priced pizzas are not cheap, but I ordered a large cheese, a large sausage, and a large Hungry Howie Special.
The total was just under $25, which would have made the specialty pizza about $15.
We also added the crust topping of garlic herb and it was tasty.
The pizzas were ready when they said they would be.
It wasn't busy at all when we got there, but they had quoted a 20 min pickup time.
The toppings all seemed fresh and the crust was not soggy or burned.
I would definitely go there again, but mainly for the $5 large one topping :)

Great Pizza and very friendly staff.
Always quick and on time when I pick up.

Only bad thing is very small seating area.
Crusts are amazing, I had garlic herb.
Large $5 can't beat it.
I can tell their business is 90% delivery but I'd still stop by and pickup again!

Good for delivery and take out.
I had a large pepperoni pizza with garlic herb crust.
It tasted like pizza on garlic bread :)) It was very tasty.

Good pizza....great price.
Try the philly cheesesteak pizza, it is amazing!

Good prices and really tasty pizza's.
I was really impressed with the butter cheese crust, very tasty and the cheese was really stringy and laid on thick.

Based on a recommendation from a friend, I decided to give Hungry Howie's a try, in lieu of Little Caesars for their $5 one topping pizza.
I liked the yellow and black NYC taxicab-ish theme.
I was greeted by an unfriendly, inattentive employee who took payment and left on a delivery.
The lobby was very dirty and the general maintenance was poor.
Dirt and garbage everywhere, dirty, poorly maintained soda machines, and a non-operational TV adorn the interior of this joint.
The pizza was mediocre at best, on par or below the standards of similarly priced and staffed outfits.
(Little Caesars, for example)  It will take some serious convincing to pass up Little Caesars for this place in my future cheap pizza excursions.

Their pizza is terrific, but they have lost my business.
Twice now I've called with two different coupons THEY'VE given me and they would not honor them.
There were no expiration dates on the coupons, sorry Hungry Howie's that's just bad business.

This stuff is fantastic!
The crust has just the right enough of crunch, and you can choose your flavor - sesame and garlic herb are my favorites.
Toppings are high quality, and the sauce is delicious.
Topping choices are decent - not as many as I'd like, but they have green olives, so consider me a happy customer!
Very highly recommended!

We were very pleased to discover one of these in Las Vegas, a big bonus that there was one somewhat close to home.
Cajun crust is the only way to go!

they have flavored crusts and the pizza itself is pretty good =) great experience would go back if i wanted a to have a movie night at home with my amazing wife =)

$5 for a large 1 topping pizza with a choice of differnt tasting crusts?
Yep, it's great!

The staff sucks, but the pizza rocks!
Every time they are rude I swear off them forever...but always go crawling back for some of that garlic herb crust.

Good when you just need quick, hot pizza.

I LOVE the pizza.
They understand what extra cheese means!
That being said, why only three stars?
The people are jerks!
Seriously, every time I order, they act like your doing them a favor to treat you like crap.
I had the manager take my order this evening, Vanessa, good grief.
I'm sorry for adding something to my order so I can spend more money at your establishment.
Geez...
But the delivery guys are always nice :)

Four stars relative to its competition (fast food pizza and delivery places).
$5.55 for a large one-topping carryout is a good deal, and the pizza is better than we expected.
The cheese is advertised as real mozzarella and is probably the highlight; next time I'll ask for extra.
The flavored crust is unique in this segment.
We tried the garlic herb and it is good.
Their online menu did not list jalapenos as a topping, but they have them.
The hot wings are the same as you get at any pizza place, baked in the oven and not crispy.
The hot sauce is serviceable but not memorable.
We tried an order of the cinnamon bread and we surprised at how good it was.
Not a gourmet dish of course, but chewy with lots of cinnamon and icing; it really cures a sweet tooth.
Based on reviews prior to 04/2012 we anticipated poor service, but the nice lady who took our phone order was very patient and friendly.
My wife picked up the order and she said the place looked clean and everybody was friendly, even when she tacked on the order of cinnamon bread as an impulse buy (she smelled it when she walked into the store and had to buy it).
She also said the baked subs smelled awesome, so we may try those next time we want something cheap and quick.

For the price and size it was okay.
I was not too impressed because in comparison to the other pizza business it is about the same.
The advantage they have it the crust.

The pizza is pretty good considering the price, but I have to agree the service here sucks.
I was on my way to a friend's house and I wanted to grab some take out for us.
This is in my neighborhood and in the direction of my friends house so location was the deciding factor here.
I walked up and ordered with a gal in the front and was told about fifteen minutes, which is not too bad.
So I sat down and waited.
And waited.
And listened to the cashier whine about her personal problems as her conversation echoed through the store, and waited.
At the twenty five minute mark I started to pace around.
Finally some guy comes from the back and asks me my name.
Turns out my pizza had been sitting in a warmer for God knows how long while I sat in the lobby waiting.
That beyond pisses me off.
Maybe while your crying about your life, you could, I don't know, also pay attention to what is going on too.
I don't know it might be too much to ask for.
I'll skip this place in the future.

Grew up with this place-love it!
Butter cheese crust is my favorite.

Terrible customer service.
Owner valued a few dollars and his pride more than my 2 year history of ordering an average 15 pizzas per month.
I ordered their special (5.55 for a large one topping) with pineapple, they brought me a large Hawaiian.
This was a few dollars more.
I called them to discuss error.
The owner had to call me back.
He insisted I was wrong and would not budge.
Hmmm.... nearly 400 pizzas (I'm ordering for 10 people) ALWAYS one topping and I was wrong?
The error was not that big a deal, it happens.
What was a big deal was how the owner so pridefully and stubbornly handled me.
So if you want to just be another dollar, eat there.
If you want to have the value and respect of a loyal customer supporting a family business, eat somewhere else.
Buh-bye Hungry Howies.

Yesterday I came into Hungry Howies with two coupns for a free small cheese pizza.
Even though there was a bit of confusion on how to apply the coupons, the employees were very nice and even gave me some free breadsticks for the wait.
I loved the pizza, and the flavored crusts!
The cajun flavor was the best (I got garlic and cajun crusts) and the breadsticks were good as well.
I want to try all the crusts now :) Overalll their service and food were great!

Terrible customer service.
I called in for one of their specials opted in for the delivery option.
First off they put me on hold about 6 times just for a pizza order.
I had to give my address to 3 different guys because apparently no one knows WTF they're doing!!!
Lastly after I was finally able to place my order, one of the workers called me half an hour later saying that I was out of their delivery area.
Like really?
You didn't know I was out of your area after I gave you guys my address 3 Fing Times!!!
PIZZA HUT HERE I COME!

So we've lived down the street from this place for a couple years but have never tried it, so we finally decided to try it.
I was pleasently surprised.
We got the deep dish veggie, which was actually not bad.
We also got a junior pizza for my neice, it waas cute.
The one thing I thought was weird, was the subs.
They come like a calzone, which is different.
Not a bad thing, just expected the regular sandwich.
The only complaint I have is the delivery time, took about an hour, but the food was still hot so can't complain too much either.
All in all, not bad.
Id go there again.

Pizza was almost burnt  the crust was too salty  worst pizza I've had ever

i didn't even know there was a hungry howies in las vegas!!
well, north las vegas, but close enough.
i got a large 1 topping and a deep dish 2 topping.
it was as good as i remembered and maybe even a little better now.
i had it delivered.
they said it would take 45 minutes to an hour, but i got it in a little less than 45 minutes and it was nice and hot.
i finally found a good pizza place in las vegas.
they even have green olives!

First time customer.
Ordered the works deep dish!
Very good!
Will be coming back definitely.
I'm normally a grimaldi's, settebello's, verrazano's or Due Forni pizza eater but Howies is definitely in my top five now.
Never heard of them before

Only issue when picking up is the long wait to pay.
Pizza is great for perfect price.

I had a slice of pizza from this place at a friends house shortly after they first opened.
I couldn't remember if I liked it or not, so I suggested to hubby that we try this place for dinner.
The employees inside were very courteous and friendly and the guy who gave me the pizza let me know they offer delivery, which is a plus if you like the pizza.
Hungry Howie's claims to be "The Home of the Flavored Crust" and offers 8 different types to choose from.
The concept here I do like.
It sounds like a too good to be true pizza place.
Well, it is in my opinion.
The 8 types of flavors are butter, asiago cheese, cajun, butter cheese, ranch, sesame, garlic herb and onion.
Sounds great right?
I ordered a large "Cheese Pizza" and a large "1/2 Pepperoni and 1/2 Sausage Pizza" as well "Asiago Howie Bread" to go along with the pizza.
When I first opened the pizza it looked great.
I asked for the cheese pizza to have butter cheese crust.
I could see the ring of butter soaked into the pizza box around the crust and it didn't bother me because I did order a pizza with butter on it, but the crust as well the pizza in general had no real flavor.
Maybe all the butter cheese flavor soaked into the pizza box instead?
The pizza wasn't gross, it just wasn't great.
Very average for all the flavor the menu claims to offer.
Hubby had garlic herb on his crust and after I sampled a bite of his crust I tasted no garlic flavor.
The howie bread I found to be dry and not the type of cheesy I was looking for.
The total was $25.93 for the 2 pizzas and bread which I wouldn't have minded if the food tasted as good as it looked.
I might be up for trying this place again in the future, but not anytime soon.
Other things offered on the menu are salads, calzones and wings.
You can also order online.

The people working here are nice and the inside is clean.
I had howie bread and that was hard and the pizza sauce that came with it tastes terrible.
I liked the thickness of the crust on my pizza but the pizza itself really lacked flavor.
The pepperoni and sausage on my pizza did taste okay but the pizza all together just wasn't anything special.
The amount of toppings on the pizza was fair.
There was supposed to be a garlic flavor on the pizza crust but I tasted nothing but a so-so pizza crust.
I'm a big boy who can eat a lot and could only eat 1 and a half pieces.
I'm not a huge fan of Little Caesar's but the pizza there is cheaper on your wallet and actually has taste to it.

Very tasty, never had a problem til tonight.
One of our medium pizza with ranch crust had ranch allllll over half of the pizza that I can scrape it off..
When I complained to Wendy and asked her to speak to the person making pizza she says she didnt know who was on the line.
Their pizzas are made salty.
I said no iys flabored crust not flavor the crust and pizza.
The other half and other pizza we ordered was fine.
I asked if I can email her my complaint along with the picture and she asked me to bring the pizza back.
It was 10pm, with 3 kids at home this was not an option and thats why I prefer email.
I asked if she even care and she says.their manager has left already.
Dead ends everywhere.
I get a free pizza but it was not the point.
I posted the picture with some ranch Ive scraped off with my finger.

Garlic & herb crust on chicken pizza- ask to cook a little extra for more crispy!
There Greek salad is good also!

Where do I begin....I love love love pizza and for a chain Hungry Howies is spot on.
My favorite by far is the double pepperoni deep dish with extra sauce.
It is very flavorful and for the price cant go wrong.
The regular pizzas are also good I do recommend extra sauce with a flavored crust such as cajun, its delicious!
The store is small but clean.
Location is very easy to get in and out of.
Employees have always been friendly.
This is my go to place for fast, affordable and convenient pizza!
Just as a side note and comparison...my other favs non chain are Grimaldis, Pizza Rock, Five50 (inside Aria), and Old School (love the dough).

I get this pizza all the time the flavor is one of a kind and the flavored crust just makes it that much better!
A must try you won't be disappointed!
