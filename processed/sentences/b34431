I love getting my hair cut by Jackie!
I always leave looking and feeling great about my new cut.
Can't wait for my next appointment!

Jackie is the only person I trust with my hair color in the Valley - unfortunately, it took me years to find her!
She always gets the color perfect (I'm blonde) and she takes the time to truly identify the best style and shape for your face.
I highly recommend her!

RUN RUN RUN as fast as you can from this girl!!
"Hue Goddess"???
What a complete joke.
$90 for color that lasts 2 weeks at best.
I have thick hair so we put a straightening solution on the back and it  was great until next haircut when she literally CHOPPED all my hair off in the back.
Again, $80 down the drain.
Her solution for fixing the color is to pawn you off on another inept stylist.
One star is too much.
