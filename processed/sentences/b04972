I'm not a fan of makeup at all but I do admit that it does make you look more polished for interviews.
Anyway, I do not know squat about makeup and I was helped by Talia.
She was very patient, helpful and delightful!!
I highly recommend her...she is very good at choosing makeup that complements you.

This is my favorite MAC location, great and attentive staff, and of course I don't really think I need to grade the product, as the world already knows that its awesome.
Von.. Vaughn, you are a DIVA and I LOVE IT!
Awesome work!

I always get my make-up done at MAC when I have to anchor on the news desk.
The one at Galleria is the closest to our station.
I love the friendliness of the staff especially Katrina.
She chose the perfect make-up for me (professional yet stunning) - especially the hot red lipstick to match my red outfit.
I really appreciated her attention to detail and felt gorgeous!
I definitely recommend her and I plan to go to her again when I'm on the news desk in December.
