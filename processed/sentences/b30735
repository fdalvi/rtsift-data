Also tucked away in Smarty's and very close neighbor to Thrifty's Ice Cream is Chigago Jimmy's.
He has a VERY extensive menu, but we were jonezing for a Chicago-Style hot dog, so we ordered a couple and boy were those hot dogs DELICIOUS!
That snap that you'll only get from an all beef hot dog, tartness of the pickles, the heat from the chiles, freshness of the onions and tomatoes, and that neon green relish that you only find in a Chicago Dog....as close as you can get to authentic, or at least according to Jimmy...he has tried to duplicate his dogs using ingredients from Vegas, but he wasn't getting that Chicago Taste, so he's been getting everything from Chicago down to the poppy seed bun.
Next time you're headed to Smarty's, give Chicago Jimmy's a try, THEN have dessert at Thrifty's...ALOHA!!

Out of business.
It was pretty good.
