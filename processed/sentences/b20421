A very pleasant professional shop.
As has already been said, not sleazy in the slightest.
A great variety of different forms of lubrication as well as plenty of toys.
Also a range of poppers if you like to use them.
Good selection of DVDs not just pornographic but also simply LGBT or Queer interest.
In addition I also like the range of comic greetings cards and primarily use the shop for them, honest.
