Lots of equipment for a variety of work outs...

James Long and crew are a great team with a great program put together.
Can't say enough good things about Long Life!

Great environment to get fit!
I took beginning ballet and it was fantastic.
I miss ballet from my childhood and college.
It's nice to jump right back in with an incredible instructor.
Louisa Long is so fun!
I highly recommend taking classes with her she's fabulous!
I could follow her instruction and she was very attentive to the students.
The pace was great for me, with a little foundation.
The prices are extremely affordable and once my groupon expires I am planning to buy a package for ballet!

My daughter currently takes ballet and hip hop dance classes at long life fit and dance.
She had taken dance instruction at a bigger dance company before.
We love long life dance because here I feel like my daughter gets expert, quality, and professinal instruction without the drama that so often acompanies the competitive dance world.
I would highly recommend this studio if your just looking for a class for fun or fitness or if your serious about dance at the competitive level.
