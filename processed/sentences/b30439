After my second visit - I'm hooked!
I found Desirable Skin because it was close but I would drive across town for this excellent skin treatment.
I have had 2 facials by Samantha and already I see a huge difference from dull dry skin to softer smoother cleaner skin.
The place is beautifully decorated and you are greeted with some great smiles.
All the products are natural and applied with great skill.
As good or better than some of the best 5 star spas I have visited before.
I will continue to tell everyone about this place.
Worth a drive to try it out.
Excellent price for this kind of service.

I have been going to Barbara at Desirable Skin for a few years now and have been beyond satisfied with her professional technique which is so spot-on I have complete confidence in her guiding me in when to get whatever treatments she recommends to have me look my absolute best.
She is incredibly accommodating in her time and patience and her skill level is beyond compare.
I once tried a "Groupon Special" and was so turned-off by the lack of professionalism that I quickly returned to the excellent service I've come to rely upon at Desirable Skin.
With all the aesthetic choices one has in the Valley I'm left with one question...why go anywhere else?

I have been going to Desirable skin since it opened...so about 4 years.
Franchesa is a wonderful esthetician.
She is knowledgable and uses great products.
Also, she doesn't push products.
She has plenty products for sale but doesn't push you into buying anything.
I have had all sorts of treatments from Franchesa.
I use her for laser hair removal, peels, eye lash tinting, facials, derma plaining and waxing.
I also see Barbara for Botox.
She is great.
I am very happy with the results that both Franchesa and Barbara give me.
