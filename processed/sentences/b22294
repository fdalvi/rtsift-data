I love this store.
The owner is almost always there, and she is hee-larious!
At Embellish, you can find great furniture, home accessories, lamps, and even some fun little gift items.
They also offer interior design services, which makes them a competitor - but I'd still recommend them!!

If you are looking for unique furniture  or that perfect accent piece this store is full of options.
After searching and waiting for the perfect height, length and texture bench for the end of my bed, Rebecca helped me create it from start to finish.
Rebecca is the humble owner that is always a pleasure to be around and will definitely go the extra to get what you're looking for if not already on display in her wonderfully eclectic store.
It's also a great place to drop in for a last minute gift from original dry humor cards to incredibly lavish candles.

Lovely little space, not many items to choose from but from what there is, beautiful home decor items if it fits your style.
Interior and custom furniture design is more likely their business model.
On this day I was making a point to hop in and out of any local shops I could find on 7th St.
Located as a shared space on one end of a building, come visit and hit 3 shops at once.

I found Embelish Home online after searching for home decor botiques.
Their website advertises as open on Saturdays.
I drove 1/2 hour from Chandler to visit their store on at Saturday only to find a closed sign on the door at 1:00pm.
Long wasted drive for a Saturday afternoon.
Even the door says open on Saturdays.
