I took my wife's car into the dealership to see how much it would cost to repair some road damage.
After receiving their estimate, I contacted Wright Cars for their estimate.
Their cost was more reasonable than the dealership, and they got it repaired in the same time frame.
I felt like the team at Wright Cars went above and beyond in taking care of our car and helping us get the damage repaired.
Thank you Wright Cars!

Had just a GREAT experience with Vision Collision.
Accurate & fair estimate, worked seamlessly with my insurance company and the finished job looks as good as new.
Thanks Todd and team for a great experience all around.
Highly recommend.

I've had Todd and his crew work on several cars and trucks for me over the last few years.
They have re-painted the hoods of several service vans, replaced a driver side door on a service truck, replaced the tailgate and fixed the bed on my Toyota pick-up after I backed in to a tree, and just recently replace the hatch on my wife's almost new Grand Cherokee due to an altercation with the garage door.
(Garage door a little bent, but ok for now)  I run an A/C service business and its important to me the our trucks look good, so when something happens, I need to get it fixed right away, I really appreciate the Vision Collision guys for getting me in and out fast and doing it at a fair price.
