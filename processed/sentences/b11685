My wife and I loved this place when we were living in Vegas.
While it looks sketch from the outside, the staff is really friendly, and even the patrons are too!
The inside is surprisingly roomy and has couch seating, tables, a non-smoking section, pool tables and a large circular bar.
The first time we ever walked in we were greeted and chatted up by the bar tender, introduced to a few of the regulars and then bought a round of drinks from another couple.
This was our hot spot as we came here usually on Friday or Saturday nights and Sunday mornings.

When I first came here, it was great.
Friendly staff, great selection and good Prices.
Then recently something happened and it went down-hill.
Now everytime I come in here there is no one there and it takes forever to get what I need.
I miss the Kareokee Friday's and the loud crazy people that use to infest this place.
If the owner looks at this,  make some changes back to the old ways!!!!

Nice little dive bar.
They offer free pool, too- But if you're a regular they take a $10 donation for felt, cues, chalk, etc.
That's fine with me, it's way cheaper and less crowded than PTS and the bartenders are quite a bit friendlier.
$3 PBR pints.
They also have a kitchen and booth/table seating.
I haven't eaten here yet but saw the food and it looks A-OK.
It's right around the corner from my house, maybe I'll see you around!

Nice bar in an out of the way strip mall.
The staff was really nice but not what I was expecting to pay for the location and a bar with an average beer selection.
However they did have a decent food menu, a couple nice pool tables and a lounge area.
