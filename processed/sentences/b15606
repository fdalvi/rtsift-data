Went to some fights here this weekend.
This place was awesome.
I don' t think there is a bad seat in this place.
If you go here for some fights or something were the main stage/ring is in the middle, all of the seating will provide an excellent view.
The sound system was great.
Everything the announcer said was clear and understandable.
They have two large screens where live action and replays are projected.
Excellent picture and size.
Overall great venue for an event.

Went here for the first time this weekend to Watch a UNLV Volleyball.
Nice facility.

After sitting in these lightly padded seats for around three hours my butt hurt.
This venue is small so all the seats have a pretty good view.
Only one snack bar so the lines can get excessively long.
Had to hop over a concrete barrier to get to my car without having to walk totally out of my way.
I would go back to see the right act but not my favorite venue in town.
