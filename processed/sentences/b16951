Las Vegans desperate for cooking utensils shop here.
Why?
I don't know.
Probably the same reason I first went here.
No competition.
But lest you think this is a good thing.
Think again.
This place is great if you want the latest Mario Battali doo-dad or Rachel Ray goo-gaw.
But Bed, Bath, and Beyond has most of the items for less.
I wanted items like marble pastry slabs, jelly roll sheets, popover pans, etc, etc.
including crumpet rings.
But NOOOOOOOOO.
They only stock Food Network groupy trophies, not a complete line of culinary items.
And can these be ordered, they'll tell you YES.
But you need to call them.
For over 3 1/2 months, pestering them weekly.
And when they arrive, they might not even be the right size, as we found out.
As for their demonstrations.
Is the term the blind leading the blind mean anything to you?
Seventh grade home ec classes are more advanced.
Rachel Ray minus one.
And they schedule their classes and times to be open rather weirdly.
Call ahead if you must go.
They might not be open when you think they should.
And like Las Vegas car dealerships, they aren't open on Sundays.
Go figure.
Kooky.
So save your money on this and save some bitter disappointment.
If Emeril is your speed this place is, well, OK ( I admit he has endorsed a decent set of pans ) but if you are an inspiring culinary talent, don't hold your breath on getting the specialty items that set apart the expert from the average.
Based on this, I'm BASHING the Bosch.

Wanted to buy from this store but save your time because the phone and website are both bogus....too bad....  must have gone OUT OF BUSINESS!
