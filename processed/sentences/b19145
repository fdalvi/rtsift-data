I love this place.
It has everything you could ask for in a chill neighborhood cafe.
Good desserts, gellato, wine, paninis, salads, coffee, tea.
The building and decor are all new and very nice.
Check this place out for a relaxing afternoon lunch some weekend.

Jo's cafe emphasizes good tasting.
Not good health for you, or the community.
They order their desserts from all over the country.
Good if you like dessert variety, bad if you like to support local.
I would be astonished if they bought their produce from one of Many farmers markets in Madison.
They don't serve fruit smoothies.
The atmosphere is more relaxed than the nearby electric earth cafe.
No Wi-Fi.
Apparently it goes against their vision of a european-style cafe.

Oh well, Jo's is no more.

The menu was very interesting and the food was very well presented.
Mushroom soup with a few vegetables was one of the best!
Pork satay was tasty.
Shrimp risotto was good.
I like more flavor in my risotto.
Warm bread with salad or soup would have enhanced it, but, of course, I like bread with nearly all meals.
