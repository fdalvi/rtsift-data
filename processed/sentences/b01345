Ordered a pizza and cheesebread for carryout, when I arrived I was informed that they do not handle bills larger than $20.
After trying to "break" my valid US currency at the nearby CVS (which would not...)  I went back, to have the manager tell me they could not accept my valid US currency.
I guess throwing away food is better customer service than accepting a paying customers money.
I won't be back.

This is a carry-out only location and they always seem to be away from the counter...
I'm not saying they take forever away from the counter but for a tiny place I'm always wondering where they could be... anyways, the staff has always been friendly during my pickups.
The previous review is correct in that they don't take anything over a $20; I think part of that is that they are not in the best area...
I use a debit card so that doesn't matter to me at all.
The new pastas they have here are very good so give them a try.

Best pizza we had in a long time.
Thanks.
I don't think anybody beats Pizza Hut and the way they did the pizzas

This place has crappy customer service.
They forgot part of our order from tonight.
When we called to get it corrected the manager was rude and unhelpful.
