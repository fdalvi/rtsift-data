My family and stay here while passing through Wisconsin, and this is a very family-friendly hotel.
There are several family suites with a dining area, king bed, and separate room for the kids... all at a pretty moderate price.
The pool area has a separate splash-pad for the kids, which is unique to hotels in the price range.
The rooms are clean and the breakfast was the quality one would expect from Country Inn and Suites.

Fantastic family hotel at a great price!
I love that a full breakfast is included.
Kids loved the waffle maker.
The staff at this hotel have been extra-friendly.
They even called my room after check-in to make sure we were happy.
Nice touch.
Fun indoor kids pool - we played in here for hours and loved it.
Highly recommended family hotel.

Always courteous staff, clean rooms, comfy beds, excellent breakfast and pool area.
Good value stay.
Always my first choice to stay in this part of Madison.
