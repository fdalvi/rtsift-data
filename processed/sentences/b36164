There's a lot of really cute stuff here, and the owner is really nice.
I got a really nice vintage desk here.
When the owner gets these things, she doesn't just paint them up all pretty, but she reglues joints and such to make them even more durable!
So I know I have a piece that will last a very long time.

Very nice little place with plenty of things to see, from kinck-knacks to funiture...
Most everything is very reasonably priced.
The owner is super nice and will go out of her to way to help you!
She put her life into opening this shop, stop in a take a look!
