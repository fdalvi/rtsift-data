Thank you Sonora Quest for  having online scheduling.
I had to get blood drawn the other day and I went online and made a 2:30 appointment.
I showed up at 2:25, and at 2:30 they called me back and drew my blood.
I was in and out in about 10 minutes.
In previous years I have waited up to an hour, because you just had to stand in line and wait.
This new process is fantastic!

Make an appointment ahead of time!
The receptionist was really bad at communicating with you if you are a walk-in.
All she will tell you to do it sign in, take a seat, and she will call you to collect your lab slip and insurance card (usually an hour or so later after you sign in).
Then you have to wait another 15- 25 minutes before they will call you back.
The waiting room is super small and being confined with sick people coughing for an hour and a half will bring out anyone's inner hypochondriac.
Out of frustration, two patrons got up and left before there names were called because all the reception would tell you was how many people were in front of you, which is horrible because that could mean 20 minutes or forty.
However, once you get back, the phlebotomists are really nice and it takes about 10 minutes for the blood samples to be collected.

Nice people, in and out very quickly!

Came here for some blood work.
The front desk staff were very nice and friendly.
And the woman who took drew my blood was awesome and very nice - she had a fantastic accent as well.
Walked in at 2:05pm Got blood work done at 2:45.
(Note: I did not have an appointment)  Also not this office takes a lunch break from 1:00pm to 2:00pm so the office is closed at this time.
