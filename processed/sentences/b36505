The only thing I knew about improv was from Whose Line is it Anyway, so I expected games and jokes and puns.
Boy was I wrong.
This was like Saturday Night Live, but made up on the spot.
The Sleeping Policemen (the last group to go up) were the best part, incredibly hilarious.
For less than a movie ticket, this is the best value in town.

It's hard to find funny, genuine on the spot greatness but enough of improv vegas's performers have that in their back pocket to make improv vegas's S.E.T.
worth seeing again and again.

I went to my first drop-in class this summer with no improv experience.
I thought it would be embarrassing to go try to learn around a bunch of people who are involved in theater, film & improv.
But they accepted me immediately & I look forward to it so much now.
Paul is a phenomenal instructor & the performers at SET make me laugh all night.
They even let us novices go up as the 1st troupe occasionally at SET.
And it is always a blast, even when we suck!
Definitely try it.
It's a unique & liberating experience with so many talented people you can't help but learn too.
