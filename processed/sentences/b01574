I was pretty pleased with my visit to this cost cutters location.
Granted I had a simple request, just a few inches off and layers.
However, I really felt like the lady that helped me did a great job of giving me a fresh new look, instead of just layers around my face she really took her time and layered my hair in the back too.
Liked that she was very careful and meticulous in cutting my hair.
Would come here again

I love the way Lisa does my hair - she is the best and the prices are really great too!!!!
I tried different expensive places where I paid over a $100 dollars in haircut and color and nobody can do the job like Lisa does it.
I'm so glad I finally found my new stylist here in AZ!!
