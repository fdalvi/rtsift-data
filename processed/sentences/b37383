I ordered a pizza on the phone...the price was $10.95  when I went to pick it up I gave them a coupon for $5.00 off I was charged $12.82 which was more than it should have been even without the coupon...why oh why  I live around the corner from this place and we have flyers in the lobby from them..I guess I will have to tell them to remove them

I found them on Restaurant.com.
I had a coupon which they agreed to deliver if I tipped the driver well.
1:40 min later I called to make sure they had not forgotten me and was told the driver had already left.
31 min later I was actually leaving to go get something else to eat when the driver finally showed up.
What is so frustrating is that they never hinted to me that it might take over 2 hours, and then when I called they lied to me by telling me my food was no longer in the building.
I won't be ordering from here again.

Needing some food after a long day of drinking.
Just happen to pop into this place that was close to where we were staying.
We ordered two pizzas and they were great.
Loved the feel of this NY pizzeria.
Prices were right and friendly staff.
I am sure if in the area and wanting pizza I will be back.

Food was great and customer service too.
Great pricing.
Totally recommend for anyone wanting to get away from the hustle n bustle of the busy side of the strip
