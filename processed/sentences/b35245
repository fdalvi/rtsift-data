I wanted to like this place, I really did...seeing as I am from SF, I thought - how perfect!
A little slice of North Beach here in Phoenix.
Not so much, as it turns out.
The meat, cheese and other toppings were great and generous, and I love the sauce they use on the sandwiches, but the bread is terrible.
I am not sure if I had stale bread or what, but it was chewy and dry - I couldn't even finish my sandwich.
Very disappointing, especially given the price.

Deli??
I did not see a meat slicer, a display case with meats and cheeses to choose from?
The menu is just a list items to make sandwich with?
Jersey Mikes now that is a deli!
