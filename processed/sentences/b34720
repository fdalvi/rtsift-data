Cleaned my tile and grout and it looks good as new.
Fast, friendly, and fair... as good as it gets.
I highly recommend that you use Lighthouse Surface Solutions too.

Very prompt and on time for free estimate and appointment finished job in the estimated time .
Tile and grout looked brand new afterwards .
Would highly recomend they have earned a regular customer .

Lighthouse Surface solutions came out to clean the grout in my home.
They arrived exactly at they scheduled appointment time.
They came in & took great care to be thorough.
I was also very impressed as they laid towels along my wood flooring so as not to scratch or dirty it with the cleaning hose.
They completed the job in a timely manner & their price was very reasonable.
The owners are very friendly, honest people.
I was very pleased in my dealings with Lighthouse surface solutions!
I definitely recommend using them for all of your surface cleaning needs.

I have worked on a professional level with this company, and they are over flowing with integrity and the desire to get the job done correctly, not just to make a buck.
As they are in my neighborhood I feel they are the logical choice for a local company, but regardless where you are located, this is an honest, capable, business partner that can take care of your flooring needs.
