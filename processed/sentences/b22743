Has gas for $3.55 which is less than home.
Tons of people here.
The people who were kinda loitering around here weren't the most savory lookin folks either but hey, when gas is that much less expensive, you will stop here.
Thank goodness we brought a few friends in the car with us.
I wouldn't  come here alone.
I was able to pick up some drinks here and things for about 1/3 of the price on the strip.
It's not the safest or nicest looking place and i have been to much worse.
But, like I said, the gas was cheap.
Thanks.

Again, breaking my rule about chains, especially a gas station, but just be careful.
While the prices may be good, they're REALLY fast on the trigger finger, and will demand payment before processing any sales or discounts.
Then they'll look at you like YOU'RE the one with the problem when you tell them something was on sale or had a lower marked price.
It picks up a whole star for convenience when it's right next to my work.
