I had both brunch here and sampled their spa.
The brunch was about what you'd expect.
No surprises.
No wows, and no bad complaints either.
Too bad it's just plain and no biggie.
The hotel has a good reputation.
I think they should try harder.

Boyfriend and I had brunch here and it was truly awesome.
Huge selection of stuff, from charcuterie, caviar, sushi, a big dessert room, omelette station, fantastic cheese station, bloody mary bar... the list goes on and on and on.
I will say nothing more than that... well, other than UNLIMITED CHAMPAGNE AND BLOODY MARYS INCLUDED WITH PRICE.

When we entered, we were told the brunch menu had been considerably reduced, so perhaps these previous reviews refer to it.
There were no free drinks, and the OJ and coffee so liberally poured were neither exceptional nor included.
A hotel restaurant to the tee, in all it's mediocrity.
Perhaps the breakfast buffet was better; we ordered off the menu.
My omelet was rubbery, his french toast was good.
Pricey, and things like toast were extra.
Be prepared for a maze of elevators and wings to find it if you self-park.
Service unfailingly polite, but not much else positive to offer for this place.
