I love this place.
I make a special trip to have my mani and pedi.
It is a clean shop, the staff are all very nice and their service is terrific.

the pedicure was nice, I will give them that... but lady must have wanted 2 close shop early that day as I told her I wanted a pedi & an acrylic manicure when I first walked in.
(She asked another customer to come back the next day while I was getting pedi).
Needless to say, I didn't get my acrylic set, and towards the end, I could tell she was 1/2 arsing it... and they were a lil pricey...
I mean, really, $5 for taking off my nail polish?
I would give this place 1 star, but they did do a good job on the pedicure.
not returning here...

I live in a small town in New Mexico and come to Ahwatukee to visit family.
I wait to have my pedi at Foxy's because they are so good at what they do.
The staff is friendly, helpful and good at what they do.
I always leave there with happy toes!

This place rocks!
My sister lives in Phoenix so anytime I go to visit her, we always get pedicures done at this place.
My sister has been going here for years and won't 'cheat' on them with a different place.
They do a really good job and they are cheaper then the average nail salon.
It's extremely clean and the staff is always friendly.
Fantastic!
