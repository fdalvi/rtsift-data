I'm not one to generally write reviews, but I have to let you all know about Courtney Odom's wonderful esthetic work located at the charming Vanity on Mill Hair Gallery and Spa in Tempe.
Courtney is personable, professional, knowledgeable and most of all helpful.
She suggested I get eyelash extensions when I went to her for a brow wax, and, although I have seen her great works in the eyelash department, I opted to condition my lashes with the City Lash product I bought from her to help my lashes grow longer.
It's working.
Just what I needed!

Amazing!
Courtney is friendly and professional and really knows her stuff.
She graciously squeezed me in on the Fourth of July for a bikini wax (unlike most places, Courtney works for herself and therefore isn't constrained by pre-set hours).
I would gladly recommend her to any friend.
