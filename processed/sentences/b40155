went with my roommate and boyfriend at Atomic Liquors on Friday night to have a couple of cocktails.. all of a sudden a tray of large sized samples toted by a sweet blonde girl caught the eye of the boys.
she let us know that its was from the food truck " Truck-N-Yaki", parked right outside.
the samples werent super hot, obviously, but even so, they were so good and after one more cocktail, we all found ourselves hungry and wanting more.
I headed out to the truck and ordered two chicken and fried rice bowls since they were only $4 a piece.
the portions are huge for what you are paying too.
service was very fast , as i only waited about 2 minutes.
Seriously, SOOOO freakin good and such sweet people operating.
I found myself daydreaming about it at work today.
long story short, we had two orders, then ordered two more on our way to the car!!!
better than a lot of restaurants Ive tried since moving to Vegas.
if you are passing by and see the truck, STOP!

I have to admit - I was a little bit nervous about shrimp from a food truck.
Boy oh boy was I wrong!
Yesterday I got the shrimp teriyaki plate (served with veggies and fried rice).
The shrimp was nothing less than delectable - perfectly cooked, plump and delicious.
The fried rice and veggies likewise had amazing flavor.
I will definitely order from this truck again.
Also, they have a really interesting sounding Asian burrito with similar ingredients that i really want to try...

I got to try this food truck out at First Friday last night.
It was oh so delicious!
I got a chicken japanese burrito and it was really tasty!
And the price was really reasonable.
I'm a big fan and hope to see them next First Friday!

Wow!
Absolutely amazing food for a reasonable price!
Thank you for coming to punk rock bowling, you guys are amazing!
The Japanese Burrito and the Chicken Plate were both perfectly done!
Great job guys!
