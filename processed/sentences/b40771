Friendly and helpful.
Been open for a while,  not sure why yelp refused to add this location the first time I put the info in.

Very friendly employees.
If i look like im searching for something, they are quick to ask or help out.
I got a price check on a cat converter and they printed out the various makers and their cost.
Parking lot was also empty so i didnt have to drive far for parking.
Clean and near store as well

second visit.
first time I needed wiper blades and counter guy looked them up, picked them out and then went outside and installed them for me.
awesome.
try to tip him and he refused.
unheard of in a town where everyone has their hand out.
last night went in with a list of stuff for a jetski.
I don't feel like roaming the aisles with that deer in the headlight look so I went to the counter.
super helpful, found everything on my list.
guy knew right where to go for everything.
saved me time and I got what I needed in one trip.
great job.
great employees, great experience.
my new go to place for car and boat stuff.
