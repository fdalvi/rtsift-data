Cool guys, very informative.
Couldn't find what I was looking for but they were still very helpful.
It's a small store so the stock selection is not that extensive.

My wife has recently started learning to change her oil and make repairs on her car.
I ofter get dragged along to go get parts.
They all know her there by now.
Everyone is always friendly and ready to answer her questions and give her advice.

This review will be sweet and simple for AutoZone because it is just that.
I needed new wiper blades for my civic so I stopped by during that little patch of rain we had a few months back.
The service is always great and the sales clerk looked up and selected the blades I needed for my car.
He even came out and installed them for me which was an added courtesy that I really appreciated.
I also like the fact that they have a few locations around town that are 24/7 for last minute or late emergencies.
My car which I have named the "Blue Zombie"  is a fun project of mine and I have been enjoying replacing parts here and there so this is my spot for car goodies internal and external.

Meh!!!!
I'm not a car person by any means, I hear wonderful things about Auto Zone, but to me they are not much better then a Walmart.
I've been to two different store in the last few months and I go in knowing nothing and leave knowing less.
Maybe its just the female in me but yeah nothing to write home about.
I'll stick to Google for any automotive question i may have in the future.
