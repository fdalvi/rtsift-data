Very nice atmosphere, friendly staff, dog friendly ( my dog got a water bowl,) lives up to the name of being a coffee shop.

Great atmosphere and even better coffee!
I was in for the first time the other day and will definitely be back.
Best coffee in North Phoenix hands down!

great coffee...great/fresh food.....great owners....great atmosphere....love this place!

I highly recommend this coffee shop!
Owners are amazing and pay close attention to customer service.
The only difficult part is deciding on which Al-Pachino you want lol lol

Owner consistently monitoring progress of this newer venue.
Fresh, well-made wraps and fair prices!!
