Great job, perfect threading, didnt have to wait, customer service was awesome, and without doubt the best prices.
Definitely my new eyebrow threading salon, I recommend this place to everyone, try it out and you will come back !
Good job Menuka !

Monica did a great job!
She makes sure you like your eyebrows.
If you are unsure she will suggest different options for you to decide.
Overall great atmosphere and price

I won't go anywhere else!!!!
Never been disappointed!
I will drive across town just to get them done from her!

I have been to at least ten different other eyebrow threading establishments before finding my go to spot!
Sara's Eyebrow Threading is hands down the BEST place to get your threading done.
The establishment is immaculate and the workers are so kind and friendly.
They are also the most gentle out of any threading place I've been to in town.
They even offer a frequent threading card so you get a free threading after nine or ten (I don't have my card in front of me to remember exactly).
What more could you ask for?
A++ service!

this is the BEST eyebrow threading place I've ever been to, I won't go to anyone else or even trust anyone else to do my eye brows.
Monica is great and she's very friendly and provides an excellent customer service.
Price is just right for such an amazing job well done.

An excellent place to get your forehead bush whacked!
Trust me, if you've never done it, don't knock it, and if you never heard of it, you NEED it!
Thank me later!

The best of the best!!!
I came here because it had good reviews on yelp and I was short on time because of work .
Normally I would go to another shop where I only like one lady there, and to my surprise the lady I like at the other shop is the owner of this one .
I love her , great service, very clean, very friendly, and most important excellent work !!!
