Great location,fair pricing, accurate gender scan!
Early detection was the best!

Came here for a gender check and so we go in, do a fun ultrasound anticipating the big reveal of our baby and the gender.
The gal said it was a boy.... two weeks later at the physicians office we found out it was a girl.
So we went back for a fresh ultrasound and they were kind enough not to charge us again.
The second time around was wonderful.
My advice, do not go in looking for a gender check.
It isn't guaranteed here, but why get your hopes up?
