This is our favorite greenhouse in Madison.
Great variety, nicely displayed and very clean.
We often find something new here and they have some terrific gift ideas.
Be sure to check out their Christmas ornaments.
Beautiful selection.
My only complaint is that sometimes the staff could be a little bit more friendly.
We had a very pleasant person check us out recently which was most welcome.

This is a nice Garden Center and greenhouse-my favorite in Madison for indoor plants.
They have a nice selection of small affordable houseplants and many types of pots-small and large, plain and fancy.
They have a little area where you can pot your new plant in your new pot which is very helpful if you don't have a dedicated area at home and/or you are buying a plant as a gift.
They also have several brands of garden seeds and seed starting supplies as well as other gardening items.
They have a good selection of interesting types of tomatoes and peppers (and others) for transplanting in the spring-a good place to come for these if you don't want to start your own and want something a little more interesting.
The location is a little funky if you have never been there before-right next to the beltline so it is almost difficult to see as it is sort of below the beltline.

Gary just helped us put together a delivery ( we are ordering over the phone ) to our daughter and he was really helpful, described plants over the phone, arranged to have them presented on little saucers and said he would text us a picture.
It  was such a pleasure to have Gary's help and make a personal present from so far away.
