OUT OF BUSINESS...Even less pizza options in the far west valley (west of the Agua Fria River)...so angry.
I always enjoyed Hungry Howie's, and now the closest one is about 13 miles away at 107th Ave & Lower Buckeye.
I will say the last time I was at this location in April, they gave me a hassle for using a birthday coupon that said Tempe on it.
They scolded me saying that I needed to go online and change it to their location, but they will accept it this one time.
Even though, I didn't appreciate how they acted; I still didn't want them to go out of business!

This place is right across the street from me and is decently priced.
Last time I ordered there I found a whole entire food service glove inside of my salad.
Extremely Gross,  I did call and they replaced the order at a later date which was to be expected or I wanted my money back.
The manager was nice and apologized but I have serious concerns about their food safety practices or lack there of.
This was definitely the biggest item found in my food to date, certainly surpasses a hair or a bug.

Meh.
I mean it's not terrible.
Prices are ok. Service is ok. Pizza is ok (pretty greasy though).
I did like the option of the different flavored crusts.
We went with the garlic herb.
It was ok. Other options were Cajun, parmesan, jalepeno, and a few others.
The decor gives me anxiety.
Way to much yellow but I guess that's a HH signature I suppose.
Nothing really to write home about.

They have been reopened for a year or more.Average food at a cheap price.
Not bad if you are hungry and lazy like i sometimes am.
