Mary has been so awesome with customer service.
I have been a frequent customer over the last two months.
Trying to get this location recognized on Yelp took some doing, but finally it happened.
This is a great location near the 215 freeway, but it is also is far enough away from the busy Arroyo Marketplace.
This location has a dining room that is open late and is a good option to try their turkey hamburger.
Some of the most friendly and best service I have received from a fast food restaurant.

This is my favorite Carl's Jr. location in town!
The employees are super friendly and the restaurant is always spotlessly clean.
I love Carl's low-carb lettuce wrapped burgers and the folks here understand what I want when I order that (they will seriously wrap ANYTHING ON THEIR MENU in lettuce to make it lower in carbs)!
I just love this location, you can't go wrong here.

I went there today and the food was pretty good, but what grossed me out was the fact that the lady taking orders and bringing out food was also cleaning the bathrooms they should have a separate crew for that!
eww
