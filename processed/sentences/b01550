Sometimes you just have a pair of shoes that you love so much, you keep getting the soles or heels replaced.
I have a pair of classic Joan & David black pump, suede that is so comfortable that I think I've had them for over 15 years and I just keep replacing the heels.
This time I took them to Paradise Family Shoe Repair.
The place is on the SE corner of Tatum & Thunderbird.
Place is super clean and the guy very friendly.
He charged me $15 to replace the heels and an additional $25 to add some super tough rubber sole to the leather soles of my heels.
When I got the shoes back, I was impressed by how well replaced the heels were and I am very happy with the super tough rubber soles that were still comfortable because I know my classic black pumps will probably now last me another 20 years.
The best part?
My black suede was looking a little worn and he sprayed a product call Suede Renew on the pumps (at no additional charge!!
) and my shoes came back looking brand new.
He told me I would be impressed by the work he does with my shoes and I have to write that he's right!

I am a shoe repair store regular, because I prefer to maintain a good pair of shoes rather than shop for a new pair.
I tried this place when I first moved to the area.
I have never been told quite literally that my shoes were not worth repairing.
When I told the man that I had had the soles replaced several times before and that price was no issue, he told me it wasn't worth it for him and to go buy a new pair.
So I took them a half mile down the road to Cobblestone and they had them looking like new in no-time.

I dropped a Chanel tote and shoes off for repair and reconditioning and all I can say is WOW.
The bag and shoes came back looking almost new.
The repair was done quickly and at a fair price.
I cannot recommend this place enough.
