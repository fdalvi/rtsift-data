Great new nail salon on the west side of town.
Clean and bright inside with really nice massage chairs.
My daughter and I have been here twice and my husband once.
We have all been really happy with the results and the service.

Thanks Yelp for helping me find this place!
This is a new salon so it is not busy yet.
I was able to get in without an appointment.
I got a pedicure and an eye brow wax since they were having a special.
I tried talking to my technician but she did not appear to really understand English.
She did a good job cutting my toe nails.
I got a slightly higher priced pedicure to get a salt scrub and leg massage.
The salt scrub was a little strange.
She only scrubbed my feet and ankles but not the leg.
I did get a pretty good leg massage with hot stones.
It was nice.
My totes were painted and it appears to be a nice job.
The technician left without a word do now I'm sitting here letting my nails dry.
The salon is SUPER quiet!
There is little noise and no music.
I like a salon with at least some music lightly playing in the background.
Since the salon is new they are a little limited on services but plan to add more in the near future.

Worst Nail place EVER!
i created a yelp account just to let people know of the HoRRIBLE service i had there, i was told i was sensitive after being hurt with the electric file thing 3 times the last time i started bleeding i told the nail guy"you say i'm sensitive?
i'm bleeding!!!
technician was such a jackass!
he also cut my nails the size i wanted them and filed them so much they are not even long at all, i will post pics.
DO NOT WASTE your time or $ here

Wow, so glad I found this place, went to many upscale nail salons, very pleased with the service!
Phonomenal job!
