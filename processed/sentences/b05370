Kinda hidden in the back of a shopping center with Lucky's this place is just where gamblers go to work without an distractions.
only 20 or so machines.
But we don't go hear to gamble we go for the CHEAPEST cigarettes anywhere in town

If you ever find yourself in one of about 700 Dotty's in Las Vegas, you know you have a problem.
Imagine your grandmother's living room.
Now fill it with slot machines and degenerate gambling addicts.
If I remember correctly, they'll comp your drink if you're playing a nickel slot machine.

so being a smoker Dottie's is one of the cheapest places in Las Vegas to get cigarettes  today I got a pack of Marlboros and a pack of pall malls for under $7  yes it does look like a grandma living room but I also win money every time I go in there the drinks are comped and they have great snacks it doesn't matter what time of the day or who's on shift they are always super friendly and welcoming
