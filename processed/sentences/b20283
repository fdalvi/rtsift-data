The Elm Bar seems to have a bit more life to it than the other 'old man' pubs on Leith Walk.
The decor inside, although not especially modern, still makes the place feel comfortable and welcoming to customers of all ages.
The drinks are priced as you wpould expect of a pub in the area with pints costing around £3 and spirits slightly more.
It seems to make an effort to encourage a younger and more lively clientele by showing high profile sporting events on its plasma screen.
When we were in last year it was showing American football on ESPN as well as the English Premiership matches.
This helps to set the Elm Bar aside from the other more standard pubs in the area and the food it served also looked pretty good.
The couple next to us both got served sausage and mash which looked and smelled quite tempting!
I doubt we will ever be back just because it's too far away from where we now live, but if you're in the area then it has a surprising amount to offer.

Handy bar if you have a few minutes spare waiting on a bus as it's right next to main bus-stop at Elm Row.
Has good selection of drinks with house double vodka and mixer for £3 , large tv's showing all sports.
