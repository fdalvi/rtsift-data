Nail Trix became part our sisterly pamper-me day simply because we were in the neighborhood, and this was the only place that does nails in the Galleria Mall.
The service was good, nothing special.
Our nails turned out real pretty - we both got french pedicures, my sister also got a french manicure.
The price was a little more than I expected.
I paid over $20 for my pedicure.
The salon seemed a little crowded - not including the patrons.

when you go there, make sure to ask for Ashley:) she is really good and she made me feel like a priority.
overall service good, a little crowded.
she specializes in gels and is there all the time.
the price was fair and i got to do shopping afterwards since it was cleverly placed inside the galleria mall.

This was my first time getting my nails done at the mall & I only went here because my cousin & I were rushing to get our nails done before I went out that night & the nail salon by my house was busy with 10 ladies already waiting.
As soon as we stepped in, we were looking to see if they do acrylic/gel glitter nail designs but all they do there are white tips & airbrush.
Since we were in a rush & on a budget, service wasn't at all bad but we wished they'd offer more.

I always love the way do my pedicures an I always get the French pink an white.
Looks great as always...

Never again.
I had a pedicure done here, and I never go to the mall unless I'm desperate, but I gave in because it was convenient one Saturday morning since I was at the mall anyway.
Check-in was easy.
They were able to see me as a walk in.
Someone greeted me right away.
I can't remember the girl's name, that did my pedi, but she was not nice at all.
Rude.
She kept rolling her eyes at me because I had some callouses on my feet.
Of course, I'm wearing sandals this summer, and it's dry weather.
Usually, people have just asked me if they could do a callous treatment on me, but she kept pointing out how dry they were (at least 3 times).
I was very nice about it, but I just told her to do what she had to do.
It's fine to point it out once, but not 3 times with attitude.
Thoughout the pedicure, she kept demanding I stick my foot out or up... but not in a nice way.
She was kinda high maintenance about me making it more convenient for her.
I've been getting spa pedicures for years, and I  never had to work so hard to get it done right by the person doing my pedi.
Isn't that why they have massage chairs?
To make it a relaxing experience?
I will say, the gel polish (in pink/white) looks great (as good as any other pedi work I've had done elsewhere).
But after working with her (darn it, what's her name???
) I will never come back again.

Heck no techno.
Went here yesterday with two of my cousins.
We had been looking around last minute for 2 pedicures and a manicure.... and the wait times had been crazy...
So we settled on Nail trix, since we were already going to the mall.
The wait wasn't long, so we decided to pick out colors.
We sat in the pedicure chairs, and soaked for a little while, while cousin number 2 was sitting next to us, waiting for a manicure.
This is when I should have stopped them and walked out...  *******************I did not see them open new utensils.
************************  They just came over with a basket and dug them out of there.
Everything in this salon has a layer of dust on it,  even the can that says "sterilizer" was FILTHY.
It looks like it hasn't been thoroughly cleaned since the 80s.
The massage they gave was terrible.
Non existent.
My first cousin started her pedicure first, then my pedicure was started, and finally, my second cousin's manicure started, after the woman was done texting on her phone, because she wasn't aware that she was "waiting.
"  Even though when they have you "sign in" I put down two pedis and one mani.
WE WERE ALL DONE AT THE SAME TIME.
$70 for this?
I think not.
Next time, we will wait for a REAL salon.

I dealt with Vivian so I can't speak for the rest of the staff.
She was rude and unprofessional!
She nicked me twice and then had the nerve to call me sensitive!
Will I go back?
Not a chance!

Utensils are not sterile, and the pumice stone and callous remover tool were not new.
All were not in sterile packaging/solution.
Gave an extra star for not getting an infection and for the semi friendly service.
