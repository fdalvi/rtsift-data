My sister told me about this place so I ordered 1 large pepperoni pizzas to go for the family.
Cheesy & delish.
They have a $5 special for a large one topping, can't go wrong with that in our economy!!
We're ordering it for dinner tonight.
If you want a good pizza, try this place out!

Looks like they closed, sigh.

There is no wonder this place is out of business.
They deserve a -1 star!
When they first opened I decided to give them a try.
Everyone wants to try a new pizza place.
At first it looked like family business that probably made some good pies.
When in reality Pizza Hut or Dominos is better and I don't order that kind of pizza.
The pizza looked like a frozen pizza thrown into an oven and shoved into a crappy box.
The bottom of the pizza had the little dots just like a frozen pizza from the grocery store!
But the funny thing is, the frozen grocery store pizza tastes better than this did too!
The sauce was l swear from a jar that read "pizza sauce" and the directions said "pour over pizza dough".
YUCK!
Just terrible and when I saw that they were out of business I smiled and said YES!
Now, hopefully something good can go there in its place.
10 years ago it was Port of Subs and I have missed them ever since.... :(

So happy this place is back in Business !
Great Pizza, for the Price !
