Great service and great food.
It's great to have Jack's back in KW!

Great service and good food.
Very convenient location.

Always been good.
It's jack astors so you know what you are going to get but this one is nice and has great service.
The location in the mall is handy as well if you need to do some shopping.

Nice location, we went on an off night and service was fast and friendly.
I got the giant 'Deluxe Bacon Cheeseburger' and it was great!
Tons of cheddar shacked high, took some real work to eat this as tall as it was.
We're definitily planning a return visit once we cycle through a few of the other local restaurants.
