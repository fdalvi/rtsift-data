i knew i was in trouble when i asked the receptionist at my hotel if there were any good italian restaurants around and she referred me to britain's equivalent of the olive garden.
i was on my own.
i came across pallucci quite by accident; it was right around the corner from my hotel.
real italian staff gave me a glimmer of hope, as did the authentic menu.
it wasn't bad; actually above average fare for britain, but it fell way short of what you'd get in italy.
or sacramento.
the eggplant parmagiano appetizer gave hope and the seafood mare al piatto was fresh, yummy but heavy on clams and short on everything else.
the house-made pasta was just about right on but the sauce was a bit off the mark.
overall, above average considering we're in scotland but this place wouldn't last a month in italy.

Located in a prime position near the university and just down the road from Princes Street, Pallucci's is perfectly located for tourists and locals such as myself.
I was pleasently suprised upon entering that the staff were friendly and helpful - getting us a seat and asking for drinks orders promptly, a must in my list of rules for a good restaurant.
However, this truned out to be the peak of my Pallucci experience, as the evening plateued shortly after.
While the staff remained friendly and helpful, there were points when it was difficult to get hold of them, and despite thier initial speed at taking orders etc, by the time we were ready to order our food, there was nobody in sight.
Regardless, once our food had arrived it was delicious - big, hearty Italian flavours all around - a real pleasure to eat.
However, there were complaints from within my party (small things such as steak not being cooked right etc) which was enough to cause more than a few grumbles around our table.
The cost of all this was reasonable, and we left with a smile on our face and good food in our stomachs.
