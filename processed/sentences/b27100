Oh thank heaven indeed!
My favorite "candy store" growing up as a kid.
Now that I live in a newer part of town, you don't see 7-Elevens on every corner.
I was very excited to have a brand new one built down the street!
Most 7-Elevens aren't in tip top shape and tend to be a hang out for Las Vegas' finest.
(Sarcasm)  The one down the street is clean, neat and has a well lit parking lot.
Also I love that every time I go into this 7-Eleven its always 1 of the 3 usual faces I see behind the counter.
Each one playing their favorite music on the radio, even singing along!
Every time I take the kids for slurpees after school, the worker up front always says "HI" and smiles.. HOORAY FOR 7-Eleven!
Or should I say OH THANK HEAVEN!

the home of slurpee!!!!
when u live in vegas, and the temperature goes up to 116 in the summer, there is no better way than to go for a slurpee run.

This is one of the best 7-Eleven's that I have ever been to.
They greet you right when you walk in and thank you right when you walk out.
I have never ever in my life experienced a 7-Eleven store such as this one provide their customers with EXCEPTIONAL customer service.
I would recommend anyone visiting this area to go visit them and you will see what I am talking about!

7-11 one stop shop for all the bad food!!!
im always in the 7-11 when im out of milk or grabbing something quick like chips or candy.
the guys and gals working the counter are really nice.
usually cleaning or ringing someone up.
the funny thing is they always ask if i want a bag for my milk and it just doesn't make sense to me.
we laugh and i go on my merry way.
BEST PART: they have the sour straws for slurpees!!!!!!
