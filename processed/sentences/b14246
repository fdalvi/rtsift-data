I needed some new table cloths and figured I'd give it a shot since I was in the area.
If I'd these had been around when I was first moving out on my own, I might have shopped here quite a bit.
Really, really great prices on most things.
Towels, blankets, drapes, table cloths - you know, linens.
But of course they also had some other household things like candles, and other decorative items for the home.
All relatively well priced.
Here's the thing - I didn't see anything high quality.
Most of it was fine.
Totally fine, and even nice if I was just starting out.
And, maybe fine if it's not a big thing.
I bought some solid colored table cloths there, but the next day I found much nicer ones at Target for about $1 more each.
I was willing to pay the $1 more for the nicer product, even though it would just end up with wine, cranberry, and some other mystery stains on it just like my other ones after a few years.
Anna's employees were really great about the return - which can be the real sign of class.
If you're looking for Egyptian cotton towels, go elsewhere.
Something simple?
Give it a shot.

Anna's can be a hit or miss with quality and selection they have available at their stores.
I was very disappointed in their selection of kitchen curtains, basically almost everything they carry has a cartoon chef or vegetable illustration on it.
Not exactly the look I am going for.
I found the curtains I was looking for (heavy satin,dark color) at Walmart surprisingly.
They usually have good sales on pillows and comforters.
We bought our sun blocking curtains from them and they are excellent for the price as well.
I would say this is a good place for comforters and regular curtains.

You always get cheaper prices with many of disc event
