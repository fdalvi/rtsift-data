I had a great experience a few weeks ago getting my hair done in my hotel room.
I lost my stylist's card, but she moved to Vegas from Dubai in case you want to ask for her!
OK, so why was it a good experience?
The most important reason is that my hair looked good!
Also, the stylist was on time, which was important so I could make a reservation.
The stylist was polite and professional.
She followed directions (for the most part...
I'll admit that I wanted a little less curled hair but it looked so good, I let that go and didn't insist she change anything at the end).
She did check in with me a few times if I liked what she was doing.
Also, I did my own make-up and she very nicely worked with me so that I could do it while she did my hair.
I have thick dark hair, in case that makes a difference (I know thin hair has its own challenges).
FYI - I tagged this salon on Instagram with my hair in case you want to see results (others have too)!
The pictures with this post reflect my experience (sorry, not going to post my own for privacy purposes).

The worst extensions I ever purchased!
Total waste of money

I came here with a GF to get our hair done for a night out in Vegas for her hubby's birthday.
I loved my curls and they lasted the whole night!

The experience with Dollheads was fantastic-had them come to our room to do my daughters hair and makeup and they (Cricelda and Mariana) were on-time, friendly and professional.
They did an outstanding job!
Will definitely be a returning customer.
Oh, and whomever answers their phone is soooooo friendly, too-Rafael, I think is his name.
A great experience from start to finish.
They always kept in contact with me and were a breeze to work with....
