I rarely write reviews on Yelp but had to get on here to recommend Love Your Hair.
I have visited twice and both times have had Debbe cut and style my hair.
I am the hardest person in the world to please when it comes to my hair (and was actually quite gratified when Debbe said during my last haircut, "You have really difficult hair!
") But I am so thankful to have found Love Your Hair because Debbe  1. genuinely takes the time to listen to what I'm describing I want for my hair 2. is a total perfectionist and gives it her all 3. listens after the fact if there's anything I see that I'd like changed--without getting offended 4. works to give me a style that works with my face shape and makes me look my best  All in all, highly recommended!
Cheesy name but it's true...you'll Love Your Hair!

Tom and Debe are both amazing at what they do.
Tom has been cutting my hair for going on 25 years and he's one of the ONLY people who can get my hair right and he does so consistently.
Debe has done my daughter's hair since she was a wee one.
She is a wonder with hair color!
Plus, they are some of the truly nicest folk you'll ever want to meet.
I highly recommend Love You Hair!

Tom and Debbie are amazing at what they do!
I get the best color jobs from Debbie and Tom, well I can't imagine EVER going to anyone else.
They are very welcoming and friendly and not overpriced either.

Tom and Debe take care of their customers.
Salon has a great atmosphere.
Love this place and love my hair.
You can't go wrong!
