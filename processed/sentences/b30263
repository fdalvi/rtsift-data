I have used this company twice within the past 6 months for both of my sons' birthday parties.
In July, we rented a water slide, prices were great, customer service was awesome.
We just used them again this past weekend for a bounce house.
Again, great prices, great customer service.
They don't have much variety on the bounce houses, but regardless of what it looks like, it gets the job done.
My kids loved the water slide and bounce house.
I will rent from them every year!

Great experience.
When I called near noon on a Saturday for a last minute rental for Sunday, Marisa was quick to help and made their schedule work in order to deliver and make it happen.
The gentlemen who delivered the bounce was polite and quick, same when he picked up, AND they were right on time with delivery and pick up.
Will use again and refer out for sure!

Best jumpers in surprise!
I wouldn't think of going anywhere else if I needed a jumpie!
Be sure and ask for a double jumpie discount if you get two!
