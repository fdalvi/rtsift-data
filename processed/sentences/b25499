Is probably the best Torta in the East Valley!
Not a huge selection here, but you really wouldn't want to order anything else!
Super fresh bread.
Fresh ingredients with huge slices of avocado!
The owners are what make this place special.
Super nice guys with great service.

I wouldnt say its the best torta in the east valley but it was pretty good.
Their carne asada was seasoned nicely and the bread was fresh but I wish they had toasted it a little bit.
Horchata was housemade and also tasty.
Service was friendly and prices were reasonable.

Tried Horchata for the first time here, really good stuff, made in house!
I hadn't had a torta either (didn't know there were Mexican sandwiches, is that like a British Burrito?
) and it was pretty good.
We grabbed some food late night to go and it was good, affordable, and the guy at the counter was nice and helpful with suggestions of what to order.

Really good tortas but not the best, service was fast and I will definitely be back.

Great asada tacos and quesadillas.
Definitely a treat for us, being from the East Coast.
One complaint: the menu is relatively limited.
