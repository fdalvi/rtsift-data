03/20/13  This was totally an impulse stop, as I was only at the mall to check out after-massage bath bombs at Lush for me, as well as splurge on some shower items for my lovely Mom.
I'm glad I did stop by, even though I easily spent a little over $100 on some luscious gift sets, because now I know that L'Occitane's products are completely paraben-free!
Not only was I able to give her the wonderful and new almond milk kit Amande (hand and foot creams and a foot-shaped pumice stone) AND The Vert (Green Tea) eau de toilette, but I also scored with an aptly-named Spring Ready Essentials* travel kit- a sweeter almond oil-based softening shower oil, exfoliating Amande soap (with flaked almonds), and firming milk concentrate (body cream), encased in a cute spring-green toiletry purse.
I AM ready for beautiful beaches next to oceans of blues and greens!
There's also an organic (?
) facial moisturizer I would like to look into on my next visit, but I find it strange that L'Occitane's US website does not include detailed ingredients' lists for its products.
If I find out more info, I'll include it here.
Paraben-free...
I'm smitten!
And if I find an organic line amongst L'Occitane's products, I'll be over-the-moon!
:D  *I somehow missed the name of this cute travel essentials kit, but my brain most-certainly received the subliminal message.

Wonderful store and products.
I felt like the service was a bit overbearing.
Sometimes it is just nice to browse.
I felt like I could not even look and consider a purchase because the associate was right there.
The Biltmore location is much more laid back in this regard.
I still love you L'Occitane.

I stopped in with an expired coupon and Sara, the knowledgable sales lady, told me about another mailer they were offering their VIP customers.
I couldn't resist.
Sara was pleasant, and informative.
She knows her products and in no way did I feel pressured.
When I visit Scottsdale again, I will be back!
