In-Home Appliance has helped me out several times.
Shortly after purchasing my home, my water heater broke.
They sent someone the next day.
They let me know how much it was going to be (I had a second opinion and the other company wanted to charge double).
In-Home came back out and fixed it and it ended being cheaper than he quoted!
I have also had a disposal installed along with fixing my fridge fixed with the same great service.
In-Home employees were great!
The employees respected that I don't allow shoes in my house and cleaned up after they were done.
You would never known they had been there except everything was back working!
I would recommend them and I have to my friends.

I'm delighted to have found In-Home Appliance Service after being stood-up by my long time repair service (see my other review here).
Mike was responsive and accommodating to make sure he got to me the same day, despite his own scheduling challenges for the day.
The service charge was reasonable, and I received honest (not self-serving) advice (that he could fix my fridge, but it would not be cost effective and he would not advise it, and gave great recommendations on what to buy).
Mike is a pleasure to do business with.
And the company has been in business since 1974, with a perfect record with BBB - a remarkable feat in this line of work, I'm sure!
The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars rather than 5 is because of my limited experience with them.
As things break down around here, I suspect I'll be popping back in to upgrade them to 5 stars... but hopefully not too soon!
;-)

They came and couldn't find anything wrong.
Charged over 100 dollars.
Machine wouldn't work the next day and off and on since then.
They won't return my calls.
