I had a mixed feeling about this Guess outlet store.
The prices were decent as it should be because it's an outlet store, but the selection was very small.
The men's section was decent, which I tend to take a peek occasionally because I like their men's tees.
The women's section was scarce with limited tops and pants.
If you are a Guess shopper, I suggest that you skip this outlet store and go to a mainstream Guess store.

Good service & good clothes

Have you ever had a shopping experience where you are convinced that the sales associate wants to kill you despite the smile on her face?
Yeah, we were those customers at the Guess store in the Outlets at Anthem.
I was waffling back and forth about a purchase I was making for gifts, my fianc√© was asking questions that made little to no sense to her, and the store was pretty busy and severely under staffed.
I'll give Sabrina all the credit in the world.
She put up with us and was very professional.
She never gave us a look or rolled her eyes during what had to be annoying experience, which only made the store a couple hundred dollars.
She was also easy to work with a few days later when we realized that we were one item short and called up the store to have one shipped to us (if you call they can do this for you).
The store itself is small and carries a decent amount of fashionable clothing.
The blasting pop music doesn't do too much for me, but I'm sure it appeals to the younger crowd that shops here.
