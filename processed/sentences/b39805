Professional, exceeded expectations.
Brakes and rotors replaced--completely fixed the problems!
Finished the job within a few hours.
I will be taking my car in for repairs from this point forward.

Heard thru the grape vine that Champs runs a honest auto mechanic business.
First time for me here...
They were very friendly and took the time to explain to me about my power-steering pump that when I was getting quotes was going to cost 500 plus.
Here Champ the owner or one of them, charged me $200 and replaced the belt.
They let me know it that the power-steering pump was taking in air and didn't need to be replaced.
Thanks guys I will be back.
I love family businesses !!!

Heard nothing but great things about this place, so I took my car here to have a coilover kit installed.
Exceeded my expectations by far.
Stuck to the original estimate even when it took almost a hour longer to complete than originally planned.
They made sure I was happy with the height before finishing and did multiple test drives to make sure everything was good to go.
Excellent customer service.
I will be back for  sure.

Champ's serviced my Jeep right before Memorial Weekend 2014.
I had them do a general safety inspection before heading to California.
I was a little skeptical at first, but after it was all done I was completely satisfied.
Josh and Chris, complete professionals.
Note, even after being backed up with work, they still took my Jeep.
I had explained to them my concerns about traveling to L.A, they understood.
Made it to L.A and back with no problems.
I'll be going back to Champs on the regular.
