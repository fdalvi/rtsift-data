Cheap gas, clean restrooms and safe area.
I would visit this location again if I'm in need of gas.

With crazy awesome customer service here, how am I the first to write a review?
Gas station employees who are actually HAPPY?
It happens.
Come here.
EVERY time I come in I'm greeted and when I check out they actually seem genuinely upbeat.
The sodas are my main weakness here.
79 cents and you get a massive Polar Pop soda (~44 ounces?
) that you can add nice little vitamin shots to.
I like to do Diet Mountain Dew + Ginseng to kick off my day.
Gas prices usually aren't bad, and access is pretty good to this location.
Plus, I think it's the only Circle K on this side of town.
Woo!

I cannot give this place enough praise.
This is by far the cleanest and most friendly Circle K anyone will ever visit.
The coffee bar and soda stand are always immaculate.
My two favorite employees, Casey and Rosa, always make sure that I leave with a smile on my face.
Usually we stop at a gas station for a quick fill and a soda.
The staff here makes sure ALL customers are happy and taken care of.
Much props to this Circle K!
