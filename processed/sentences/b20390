I'm always losing things, it's a good thing I don't live alone because I am always borrowing my flatmates keys to get them cut!
Gorgie Cobblers is a great shop and offers a variety of services, thankfully one of them being key cutting, and it cost £3.95 for a cut of a Yale key.
They also cut car keys, which not all key cutters do these days.
Gorgie Cobblers is a really good, convenient local business and make repairs to more than just shoes, they are also happy to repair watches and replace broken watch straps.
Inside, the shop smells lovely, I used to work in a shoe shop when I was younger and the smell of all the chemicals to do the repairs is one of my favourites, enough to make me want to come into Gorgie Cobblers even if I don't need anything.

Much as I like killer heels, I also kill my heels and last  night was no exception.
My red patent leather Mary Jane's got wrecked on the Edinburgh cobbles and as they were planned to be in a suitcase on a plane to Amsterdam for the ultimate conference outfit, I was in a state of panic.
Gorgie Cobblers have repaired a few pairs of my shoes (always the heels) and a couple of bags where the straps have broken.
Normally I'd leave said items in the shop and collect after a couple of days, but I didn't want to be mourning my left behind shoes at 35,000ft.
Luckily the very nice man said he would repair my shoes pretty much then and there.
If I was charged any more than normal (don't think I was), it would be lucky if it was an extra £1.
£6.95 for stiletto's to be repaired and they are now waiting to go in the suitcase.
Thanks Gorgie Cobblers :-D

Chances are Gorgie Cobblers have been around on Gorgie Road for as long as Gorgie Road has been in Gorgie.
A fixture on the street, always calm and friendly, knowledgable about their trades and a straightforward approach to their customers.
I've returned a fair few times and always been well looked, after as have my shoes (more importantly).
