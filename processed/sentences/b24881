Cheryl and Ray are great.
As a small business owner I can appreciate the fact that thy don't have lot minimums and I can order one or two pieces at a time.
The quality is top notch to boot, highly recommended.

They just picked up direct to garment printing and I had a slew of shirts done.
As always, it was a pleasure to work with Ray and Cheryl and the finished product is phenomenal.
Clearly a better alternative to screen printing.

This is the second time I tried Gold Canyon Embroidery.
The first time was bad but I always try to give people a second chance.
The guy who runs it (owns it?
) seems like he is always in a bad mood and has a chip in his shoulder.
I thought he had the attitude because the work was so good but to my dismay, the works is still substandard.
I live close and hate to drive a long way to get my embroidery done but that is what I must do.
Do yourself a favor and avoid this place and the bad attitude and lousy embroidery.
