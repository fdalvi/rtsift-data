Most of the time I walk into a store like this, I feel uncomfortable.
Maybe it's because I know I'm most likely not going to purchase anything and I feel guilty, or maybe it's because of the pretentious vibe that the sales people tend to give off.
It's probably a mixture of both.
And granted, I was originally NOT planning on purchasing anything in the store on this trip either.
That is, until my eyes met a gorgeous platinum sand-sparkle VPN clutch....and it was love.
Once I spotted it, I expected the sales pressure to begin.
However, I was wrong.
In actuality, what really brings my experience up to five stars was the woman who helped us, Karen.
Easily the best sales person I've ever encountered.
She really made us feel comfortable, relaxed and actually made it a fun experience being in the store and looking at all the interesting, conversation-starting items.
She was incredibly warm, welcoming, helpful and genuinely seemed like a nice, real person.
She made us feel good about the purchase and struck us both in a positive way.
I can't wait to come back and see her the next time I'm at the Wynn.
I hope Karen makes some commission off my new gift!
Thumbs up.
