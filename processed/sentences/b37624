This review is for the Gas Station here in Chandler.
It is the best priced gas I have found this week.
Just $2.95 a gallon.
I have a truck so it takes a lot of gas.
This place is a huge help.
You can pay with a few different cards but, you must scan your Sam's Club card first.
They have great hours, they are open a lot.
Not on Holidays though,such as Christmas and New Years.
Which is the way it should be.
You can also get a car wash while you are here.
For only $6.00.
They have a few different choices, it is the kind that you drive thru yourself.
It is a great deal!
What more can you ask for, If you are over in that part of town it works out really well.

Sam's club gas is the best part of Sam's club and is a must stop every time I go to Sam's club.
The last time I went the prices of premium (the downside of a nice car) was a quarter cheaper than the going rate elsewhere.

Nice station.
Wish they had Window squeegee so I could've scrubbed all the bugs off!
Sams does have best Prices.
Was 3.54 today for 91 octane.
I will definitely venture to this fuel station though from now on!
