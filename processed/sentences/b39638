I have never visited this location, however, my husband and I just moved to the area, and were needing to set up our mail with our name, so I called to do so.
First off, I stated the previous information as well as letting her know we had just had our mail key changed since we had not been given one, and had just moved into the house.
Her response to me was "Ok, so you have a key, so you are fine to pick up your mail.." (very sarcastically might I add).
My response, "Don't I need to set up an account with you or give you our name?
" Her response, "Ma'am you need to just walk over to your mailbox, use your key and get your mail out of your mailbox".
My response (and mind you it is taking every ounce of restraint to not be a complete B back to this woman), "So there will be no issues with us getting our mail delivered only having lived at this address for two days...".
Her response, 'Oh, you just moved in?
You need to give me your last name and address then"..........
It was about that moment when I slapped my hand to my forehead.
I can only HOPE that the rest of the employees at this location are: #1 not this slow, #2 do not have the same customer service as she provided me, and #3 are not such blatant Bs with their customers.
I know many postal workers are not always helpful or friendly...
I've dealt with that in the past, but this was BY FAR the worst experience I've ever had in dealing with USPS.
I will NOT be visiting this location needless to say.... and this woman is in the wrong line of work.
Customer service is not her forte...

Horrible service, never friendly and this office also lost my original passport years ago.
Every time lines are long, and they never smile.
Just rude and horrible service.
Also hen you call them their line most of the time is set on busy so you can't even get ahold of them.
That's why FedEx and UPS will get my business.
Not this place.
