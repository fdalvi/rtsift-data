The first word that comes to mind is YUMMY!
I am in this area every Wednesday and had been looking forward to eating here; last night I finally got the chance.
I had the Chicken Pesto Grilled Flatbread; great flavor at a great price.
The atmosphere is nice, very clean, with friendly and quick service.
I am already looking forward to trying the Peanut Butter Crunch and one of the many smoothies they offer!

Although my office is across the street and I've been there for years, this is the first time I visited.
The decor inside is precious, reminded me of my honeymoon in Kauai with bamboo strips everywhere.
Lots of bright,happy colors.
I shared a Hawaiian Breeze w Splenda with the wife and our 7 yr old had Jetty Junior.
We loved the drink - only 174 calories and very tasty.

The Chocolate Chiller smoothie is bomb.com!
I love when they have their happy hour, where you buy one, get one free!
