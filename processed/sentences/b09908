I LOVE the brushes they sell here!
They are of very high quality and are very reasonably priced.
They go from as little as half what you'd pay to nearly what you would pay for a MAC or Bobbie Brown brush.
The bristles never fall out, you can wash them and they are like new again.
These brushes are truly an amazing find.

Wow, Merle Norman is a great place to learn about unique Desert Skin Care in Carefree Arizona.
Barb the owner offers makeovers, tips and great advice specific to our climate and individual skin care needs.
Very pleased with the products and service.
Great to have a skin care expert so close.

Was driving on Tom Darlington, on my way to Macy's to buy makeup for my trip, when I spotted Merle Norman Cosmetics.
Remembering an ad I saw stating  that these products are made in America, without animal testing, I pulled in.
What a pleasant surprise!
Barb spent so much time with me selecting the right foundation for my skin, trying out various primers....then on to the eyes, beautiful colors, liners, lipsticks, anti-aging products plus so many products that I need, like the lotion for redness!
It was a great find and an enjoyable hour.
Will definitely forego the trips to Scottsdale and buy my cosmetics at Merle Norman.
My skin feels so good and moist!!
Thanks Barb!
