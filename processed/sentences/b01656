I'm happy, my stuff looks great!

I took a duvet cover, shams, and bed skirt to be pressed.
It looks wonderful, came back on hangars and the pleats on the bed skirt were even clipped with plastic pins to keep them in place.
I will definitely go back!

Great job keeping me clean!
Been using this place for years now.
Always on time and friendly when I drop my stuff off!
Keep up the good work!
