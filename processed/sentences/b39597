Open only two weeks, Kosher Gourmet offers Kosher Mediterranean cuisine.
Traditional appetizers, sandwiches, and dishes such as falafel, shawarma, kabobs,  as well as some Kosher dishes such as Matzo ball soup and Schnitzel.
Pitas are baked fresh.
They make an awesome falafel sandwich.
Prices are very good.
Service is interesting, with a lot of shouting between the Israeli  owners, making for an authentic middle eastern experience.
A great find in Las Vegas!
'  Shalom!

Avoid this place.
The good was par for the course.
We had a shwarma sandwich and BBQ chicken.
The chef flipped out on us about whether we wanted fries.
The menu clearly says that all sandwiches are served with fries, but the cook thought differently.
He actually came out from the kitchen, raised his voice, and asked us directly if we "requested" fries.
It was very rude and abrasive.
I will not be back.

great place with amazing kosher food and the best pitta bread ever...  love eating there ... flavor ,service and great prices  .....

This place does not exist anymore.
Wish they had taken the time to close their listing.
