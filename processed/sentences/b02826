It's Subway.
Maybe it's just me, but they don't seem as good as they used to be.
They barely put any marinara on their chicken marinara, and the bread seems to turn into a doughy mess after just a few minutes.
It looks OK when they cut it and put the stuff on it, but just in the time it took to get to the table it had collapsed from a full, airy bread to a wad of dough.
I'm not sure the toasting helped at all.
As restaurants go, they suck.
As sub shops go, they are really below average.
I'd go here before going to McDonald's or Burger King.
But that's about all I can say.
If you have other options, I suggest taking them.
If not, it beats McYucks.

Food is good and bread is fresh.
But the bathrooms are very dirty.
Makes me wonder about the kitchen.

As fast food chains go, it's OK and as another post indicated the bathrooms need closer attention.
