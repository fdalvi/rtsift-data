This store is full of high end stuff that is way over priced, the storefront is totally pointless because the instrument dealers sells most of his stuff on Ebay.
The owner isn't friendly.
I would never buy anything here.

This is one of the best and only vintage music stores/art galleries in the valley.
The prices are actually incredible.
You'll find one-of-a-kind, very rare gear in good condition for flat out steals.
Last time I was there he was selling a 73 Gibson SG in perfect condition for less than $900.
Which is obscenely affordable for that iconic guitar.
The owner, Rob, is friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful.
Come in and chat with him, play his gear.
He's been around the Phoenix scene for a long time and is a very rad dude.

I wanted to like this store.
It's right between Trunk Space and Bikini Lounge, two places I like to go, and as a musician I am always looking for locally-owned places to get gear.
But the guy who owns it/works there has amps pointed right at the Trunk Space's wall and is fond of playing noisily and at length during quiet acoustic shows.
Think it's awesome to hear a band play while some douchebag is blasting "My Girl" on his guitar next door for five hours?
It's really not.
There's nothing that the Trunk Space owners, showgoers, or musicians have been able to do to get this guy to turn it down and respect his neighbors during quiet shows.
As such, I would never consider giving money to that asshat.
Try growing up and having some respect for some business owners that have been working their butts off for 8 years before you showed up.
