Great new BBQ place.
very tasty and kid friendly.

This is a great place.
Very fun bar...lots of tv's for sports.
And most importantly, the BBQ is awesome.
All smoked on site and all different types.
Definitely worth checking out!

Wasn't terrible but not great...   First let me start that I was surprised at the lack of effort that went into remodeling this place.
Not much change from the old Redfish and for a new BBQ joint in north Scottsdale I would have expected more.
Especially considering this is the only one in the area in a 10+ mile radius.
I went there for lunch so I can't say much about the happy hour or dinner...
The service was good and the place wasn't very full.
Probably because they had only been open for a week or so.
I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and my friend ordered the sample plate with brisket, pulled pork, chicken.
My sandwich was ok. Not much smoke in the meat which I expected more.
(I know there is a fine line with too much) but it seemed that the pulled pork had been made days before and heated with the sauce.
I'll check this place out again but not for a while.
Next time will be dinner or happy hour though.

I was disappointed with the food.
Service was good but there are some inattentitive things that bother me.
All the little things add up that makes it hard for me to return.
But let's start with the food.
Ah, cornbread to start.
I love the cornbread as long as it isn't too sweet.
The cornbread was great, not sweet, and to my surprise, little chunks of jalapeno mixed in, friend and I got one each of these delightful starts to lunch.
Nice, very nice start to my anticipation of better things to come.
Lunch friend and I started with an appetizer of wings.
They came out in an attractive basket (8 of them $7.95) so they are $1.00 a piece.
Crispy fried with a sweet BBQ sauce and your usual celery and carrot sticks with what looked like ranch dressing.
Now here is the experience once I "bit" into them....sweet but no smoke or taste to the wings, just the initial sugar rush, fried skin and then no flavor to the wing.
Disappointed.
I cannot figure out what the magic white sauce that accompanied the celery sticks is?
Something whiteish, just not ranch, not mayonaise...like light mayonaise without taste, whatever it was, it remained in the bowl not eaten.
Uh Oh, I said under my breath.
OK...so I said to myself "If you want good dough...go to a bank, or go to a bakery" If you want good wings...well go to the Native New Yorker and get all you want at around fifty cents and 31 flavors if you want.
Well, let's judge them by the BBQ, that is why I came here.
So the way to sample BBQ is... the Sample plate, three meats at lunch (not including ribs I might add).
Had to have their ribs, so got a few on the side plus the one sidedish which I chose coleslaw.
Pulled pork, brisket, and chicken, plus the side of baby back ribs that I had to have.
$12.95 plus $3.00 for the side of ribs.
A little (and I mean little silver cup of BBQ sauce reserved usually for a side of horseradish)  Pulled pork....2 stars.
brisket 2 stars, chicken 2 stars, ribs 2 stars, coleslaw, 3 stars.
Sorry, Bad to the Bone no pun intended is just that.
I don't care about the decor, I don't care about mean waitresses (which in this case we had a sweet one) but just deliver me some good BBQ.

I stopped in on Thursday night to give it a try, as the lack of BBQ in the Kierland/North Scottsdale area made this a potential spot in my regular listing of restaurants when I don't want to try something new.
As at any BBQ joint, the real test is the pulled pork and the brisket, so I got a combo plate with ranch beans and sweet potato fries as the sides.
The beans were nothing very significant one way or the other, and you get a huge order of the fries that needed seasoning.
The brisket did have a smoke ring, but no bark and i was not able to taste the smoke hardly at all: it was closer to pot roast than what I think of as good brisket.
The pulled pork was pretty good: it had been steeping in its own juices for quite some time, and they unfortunately serve it with the sauce already applied: you should ask for it on the side.
The real savior was the application of Tabasco: it seemed like the sauce had been designed with Tabasco included and then they deleted it from the recipe in fear of turning a potential customer away with too much flavor: with it included the pulled pork by itself goes to 3 and a half stars.
Whole place was fairly empty when I was there, but it was 8:30 on a Thursday...if you are really hankering for good Q, brave the location and go to Bobby Q's at I 17 and Dunlap

This was a 1st time try at the new restaurant off FLW in Scottsdale.
Angie my wife and I have been waiting for it to open up to see how it compares to the BBQ food experience we had in Texas (great BBQ in Texas)  Confused as to exactly what to order (no real illustrations in the menu) I thought we might try the Lunch BBQ plate combo, so we did.
I'm not a big fan of BBQ chicken as I am very particular on how the skin is cooked and we were both disappointed that the platter only comes with dark chicken meat.
The pulled pork meat and Brisket were excellent, The brisket was so tender you could cut it with a fork but still firm enough to be brisket.
The brisket slices were also not too thick but not paper thin.
The sauce was for me just a little on the runny side, but the flavor was excellent.
So, it's not my favorite BBQ joint, but it still needs time to grow and perfect it's menu in order to make it unique enough to remain in Scottsdale.
Only time will tell...

We went there two weeks ago with another couple.
My wife ordered the sliced brisket;  I had the tri tip and sausage; Gordon ordered the stuff potato and his wife had a combo  plate  and we all had sides of cole slaw and sweet potato fries.
All the meat that we ordered was not hot off the grill.
It was dry and came with the sauce which was also cold.
The cole slaw was the way I like it, but the sweet potato fries were limp which to me indicated that it was cooked ahead of all the other foods.
The waitress was friendly and attentive.
We finished off our meal by sharing an apple cobbler.
To our surprise, our friends paid for our dinners.
"WHEW".

YUM YUM YUM!!!
If you live in the area, go here for great bbq.
It's moist, hot, corn bread is really really tasty, service is good.
Downside, some of the servers seem to be rather "green" & kind of dopey.
Drinks need improvement.
We've been here three times & have yet to be disappointed.
Its about time we got a decent BBQ place in the area!
No over-priced, hoity-toity Houston's, no hangin' out with old fogies at Don & Charlies, no dried out, wanna be BBQ like other places.
Not as casual as Honey Bear's, but REALLY good food.
I am NOT a fan of beef, but tolerate pork.
Their pulled pork sandwich is tender, juicy & perfectly seasoned.
I do add more of their sauce at the table though.
I even tried the brisket sandwich one time & was pleasantly surprised at how TENDER & tasty it was...and I'm NOT a beef person!!
Most brisket is chewy & dried out...not this stuff.
You could cut it with very little effort with a FORK.

A friend and I decided on this place last night for dinner and after picking it out of a hat (not kidding) because we couldn't exactly decide where we wanted to go and we are happy that we did.
We got there just in time to snag the last booth at the bar because no sooner were we seated then there was a line out the door.
Whew.
They have an happy hour from 3-7 and from 9-close daily and we got in just in time to snag a drink from happy hour as well as an appetizer.
The appetizer we chose was the pulled pork nachos and let me tell you they were HUGE and very good.
Their was tons of nacho cheese, pulled pork, bbq sauce, sour cream, and guacamole.
I mean whoever made ours layered it just right so that dang near every bite had some cheese, meat, and bbq sauce.
The pulled pork was nice and hot, very flavorful and not fatty (I have had some fatty pulled pork), the bbq sauce was tangy but good.
Different for me as I like sweet bbq sauce and this one had vinegar base that was actually really good.
Plus they ended up being half off because it was still happy hour.
SCORE!!!!!
Next we ordered the three meat combo to share and the meats we choose were the brisket, the tri-tip and the St. Louis ribs with onion rings and sweet potato fries.
WOW.. My friend really like the brisket and I thought it was just ok, but the tri-tip pieces we had were cooked medium and they were so juicy and flavorful with that nice slow cooked smokey taste.
The St. Louis Ribs were juicy and smokey as well and you could taste the dry rub that that used which was really good.
They put just a little bbq sauce over everything and gave you a side of it as well, but there is a bottle of bbq sauce if you want more but we barely used it as the meats were just that good to us.
Everything was served nice and hot including our onion rings and sweet potato fries which were sprinkled with cinnamon and served with honey mustard sauce.
YUM!
We ended up packing up half our our dinner and small portion of the nachos as were were stuffed!
So stuffed that even as I type this up, I am still full from last night.
Must have been those yummy nachos because I only tried one small piece of brisket, a small piece of tri-tip and one lonely rib!
lol.
Hats off to our waiter Ryan as he knew his stuff and made great suggestions.
He was friendly and checked on us regularly to make sure we were ok.
Thanks Ryan!

I'll be honest.
I'm a BBQ snob.
I rarely eat BBQ out, because I do a better job than most any place I've been.
That being said, I wanted to try this place after a number of people that have had my BBQ, said it was good.
It was OK, with possibilities, but not really a diamond in the rough.
Our server lost our original order when we added some chili cheese fries to our order.
While our fries were delivered in about 15 minutes, the remainder of our lunch took 50+ minutes to be delivered.
Then, unfortunately, our order was wrong.
We got cheese smothered, grilled chicken, instead of smoked chicken.
The pulled pork was cold, almost like it had been pulled from the cooler and not completely warmed.
Ribs, brisket, pulled chicken were good.
I like my St. Louis style ribs to be a bit more juicy, these were good, but I personally would like a bit less trimming of the fat.
Sides were good except for ranch style beans, which seemed days old.
The server did credit our bill $6 for the cold pulled pork and also didn't charge us for our drinks.
Overall, poor first impression, but enough "possibilities" to make a return visit probable.

I went back to good ole Bad to the Bone tonight and saw my usually gang, Ryan, Russ, and Jeff (Hi guys).
They are still the best waiter, bar tender, and manager ever.
Anyway I ordered my usual which is the pulled pork nachos.
They teased me as its a huge portion and I was eating alone but I gave it a shot anyway.
Something was different about my nachos this time around.
They had beans in them.
Now before someone gets their shorts in a bunch, I have ordered these nachos about three times and I have never remembered beans being on them.
I was a little disappointed because they didn't taste as good as usual, and although Ryan did offer to have them remake them for me, I declined as it was happy hour and I could just pick around it.
I did take home the leftovers and I am not sure if I will eat them or throw them out but we will see.
You will eat just about anything when you are hungry.
All in all I still had a good time and yes I know I will still go back and yes I will still order the pulled pork nachos, I will just make sure no beans are added.

Went here for the first time a few weeks ago and it was some of the best BBQ I've had in Arizona.
The service was great as well!
The manager stopped by a few times as well as our waiter to make sure everything was good.
*****UPDATE*****  Looks like they went out of business.
Haven't been open for two weeks now.....

*** Is now closed ***
