Jeremy was able to schedule an appointment for me the day i called him.
He was able to come after work, arrived early, and finished really quickly.
He did a great job and took time to answer my questions.
He is actually a  little bit less expensive than the bigger businesses and provides better service.
I will definitely call him again.

Since Jeremy started fixing my computer it has worked better than when it was new.
My computer was just a year old when I lost the hard drive and DVD/RW.
It was still under warranty so I got the part and left the rest to him.
I am not computer savvy so I am glad I found him!!!
He does amazing work, and does not cost near as much as any of the large size computer department stores.

After doing some research, I found Jeremy on Yelp.
Took my laptop to his place, he fixed our problem within a couple hours and we got our laptop back the same day!
He works out of his home and his price is quite reasonable...which is what I need.
I will definitely use him again and recommend him to family and friends.
Thanks Jeremy!
