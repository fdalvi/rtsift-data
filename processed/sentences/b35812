I have to give them 1 star other wise, No Stars!
Brutal.
Chick wouldnt even look up from texting on her phone!
I went across the street to Pet Planet and spent my $90 on the Orijen there.
Atleast they we super pleasant.

That awkward moment when local competitors come write negative reviews about a store and then direct traffic to their own store....

Great people, will order anything I need (I have horses and they don't keep horse feed in stock at this location) great prices and so convenient.
Always shop here for all my kiddos (horses and dogs :p )

My dog has a sensitive stomach Pet Club carries grain free food for him.
The staff is knowledgeable about the products and havent steered us wrong on anything so far.
We belong to their frequent shopper program and will eventually earn a free bag of food.
