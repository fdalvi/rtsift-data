I've only been to The Harp and Castle once as its so far away from where I live, but if it was closer I would probably go more often.
The decor and general atmosphere inside feels fresher and more spacious than the other pubs in the area.
It's definitely a pub for the Hibs supporters (makes sense as the stadium is just down the road) and has club memorabilia on the walls, even on the bar itself.
This isn't overbearing, however, and it still feels like a 'real' pub.
The staff are friendly and the drinks are surprisingly cheap with Tenants costing only £2.40.
The customers are mostly locals who seem pleasant and don't give off those intimidating vibes you sometimes feel in backwater pubs.
The Harp and Catle is well worth a look if you're in the area as it's cheap, friendly and also does a three course pub lunch for only about £8!

It just goes to show how little I know about football - I was in here recently, and while I picked up on the football theme, I had no idea of the Hibs connection and the fact the stadium was just down the road.
Aaaanyway, the pub itself is actually quite cool - its a bit old man pub-esque, but the staff are friendly, the atmosphere iswelcoming and even when there is a big bunch of rowdy football supporters in the pub the whole place still feels quite fun and relaxing.
Drinks are cheaper than you may have expected, but service can get a bit slow and sloppy, but other than that, an alright place for a pre-match drink.
As long as you support Hibs.
