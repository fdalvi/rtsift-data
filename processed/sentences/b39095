One pita bread for two orders of hummus?
What a joke.
Slow service too.
I'm not one to give bad reviews but this place reeked of slow service and sucky portion control.
Step your game up, guy.

waiting for my order was worth the wait.the food is awesome.we tried almost every sandwich they had on the menu.the sliders,the gyro,the kebobs.I mean the food is heaven.

Just ate at this truck at the courthouse.
I would absolutely recommend this place.
A tad pricey, however for the quality of food it seems to be worth it.
I just can't go everyday.
I ordered the Greek Burger.
Grass fed beef with spinach, feta cheese and a spicy sweet sauce.
It was incredible.
Will definitely go back... on payday.

I ate here because our club was volunteering for an elementary school's carnival event.
Walking around the trucks, I decided to choose this truck.
This caught my interest because of the emphasis for the food's "freshness".
The workers were really nice and helpful.
I got the Factory Burger.
It was made fast, but the only thing that could be better was the sauce.
The burger had a lot of sauce that made the bun soggy.
The burger itself is pretty cheap, considering the serving size but overall the burger was okay.
I'm not really a fan but I haven't tried the other burger (Greek Burger), which I should have gotten because it looks so much better.

Tony and crew were very nice and helpful with the menu.
I got the Chicken Kabobs with Mediterranean Rice, Factory Burger, Factory Fries, and Eggplant Fries.
Me and my girlfriend killed that delicious food in 3 minutes flat!!
Oh man, it was so bomb.
Thanks Tony, I was very impressed by the quality and flavor of everything.
