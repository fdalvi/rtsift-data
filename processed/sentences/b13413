Always a great haircut from Anna.
Have tried haircuts from other girls here and they just can't do a proper fade.
Hence the reason for 3 stars.
You'd think that more than one person in this joint could cut my hair properly... Anna, however, gets 5 stars she's great.

I would have given 4 stars but I got there at 10 when they opened and no one was home.
5 minutes later an employee showed up, went in and left all 4 of waiting outside for another 5 minutes.
The haircut was good enough.
I'd go back.

I got a pretty sharp haircut here, which is a big compliment provided that I am pretty pick about my barbers.
With a $2 military discount, it only comes out to $13.
The wait wasn't too long either.

Good cut.
Took her time.
