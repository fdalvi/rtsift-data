On the way to the bus station a friend and I came across a pretty pleasant green area.
It's a little odd when this happens after being in the city for a year but what was even cooler was this glass-like hub of a coffee house!
If the weather is good, or just passable, it's a nice and serene way to pass the day seated outside.
I'm not really a coffee person, but you can get a few snacks there and there's also the plus of free wifi!
