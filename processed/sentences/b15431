I am so appreciative of having an alterations shop so close to home in Fountain Hills.
I have taken very small jobs to complicated projects and have always been completely satisfied with the work.
She has done some amazing things such as shortening jeans with the original crease/fold at the bottom still showing so they don't appear to have been shortened at all.
How does she do that?
No fears ... Give this one a try!

I've always found Jazy to be extremely helpful with all my alterations and would recommend everyone to take advantage of the services.
Because of Jazy, I can continue to keep all my favorite clothes looking great with her help on the seams, collars, buttons, hems, etc.
