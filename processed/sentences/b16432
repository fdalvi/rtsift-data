Located right off the 215 and N Durango, this location is a great place to fill up your car if you live in the area.
The lanes are wide and there's easy access from Durango.

Car Wash Review Only:  I'm not a drive-thru car wash novice so I realize you get what you pay and I didn't even get a $6 car wash in my opinion!
My truck looked pretty much the same as when it entered.
The drying factor is the major fail and just left my car full of spots.
In fact when I got home I washed it myself, which is what I should have done in the first place.

The clerks are friendly, it's usually fairly clean, and they have all ice cream.
My biggest complaint is the parking lot/gas situation.
But, I can deal with it for a sweet delicious treat and fun loving employees.
