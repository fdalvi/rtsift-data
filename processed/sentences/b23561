Hidden away on Lame Mendota is a little place called Cafe on the Pier at the bottom of the Edgewater hotel.
This is a cocktail bar and restaurant on a pier over the water- does not seem like you are in Madison when you visit the Pier  Very neat place - great drink menu with a lot of unique cocktail options.
The drinks are kind of pricey, but the location definitely is worth it.
Great place to grab a drink in the one or two months of summer in Madison.

While I'm still sitting on the deck at the Edgewater Pier I felt it best to review immediately while my feelings are fresh.
Drinks, including beer, are very overpriced- food is also overpriced and bland.
Service is slow.
The only perk is the view, but if you have a boat you're better off packing your own drinks, grabbing some McDs and dining on the lake!

I ordered the fish sandwich (hovers between $8 and $9) and my hubby ordered a bbq chicken sandwich.
There was a nice guitar singer sololist.
Wait staff was attentive and friendly.
It was a gorgeous day, low 80s around sunset, so this really had a nice impact on my first time here.
No complaints!
A hidden gem, for sure.
