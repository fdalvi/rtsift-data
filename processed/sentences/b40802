Love that this place is so close to me.
The ingredients are fairly limited and they aren't the most amazing subs ever, but it definitely gets the job done for lunch!
The prices are pretty reasonable as well.
They charge extra for cheese and other items, but when I'm feeling cheap, I just load up on extra veggies (a.k.a.
the "freebies")!

The staff had no problem serving us a few minutes after closing - Definitely fast and i love the ultimate porker.. a great option when heading back to cave creek after a hockey game!

It never ceases to amaze me how fast the people are here.
It literally takes me longer to wait in line at the traffic signal turn lane then it does to park, get inside, get my sandwich, pay, and get out.
I've been here several times after work and the people are always really friendly.
The store is very clean and well kept.
I normally prefer hot subs, but I'll make an exception for this Jimmy Johns location.
These guys (and gals) are amazing!

Most mediocre sub I've ever eaten.
Limited options for toppings.
Much prefer subway where you can ask for whatever topping you like as you go through the line.
I went back with my sandwich to ask if they had salt and pepper.
"No, sorry.
" I honestly thought she was kidding.
Won't be back.
How this got to be a major chain is beyond me.
