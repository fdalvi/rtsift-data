In terms of fast food pizza, Howie's is probably my drug of choice.
Their prices are fair and the flavored crusts are pretty good.
I also like the sandwiches or maybe a greek salad if I'm feeling lazy but want something a bit more green.

I don't do the pizza thing anymore (vegan) but my husband loves this pizza!
Plus, the employees are ALWAYS friendly.
I just wish they delivered one block further so I don't have to pick up my order every time :)

I am always so surprised at how good the pizza is from here.
It's a last resort usually when me and my room mates get pizza here but it is always on point.
I feel like this is a step above little Caesars even though the prices are similar.
