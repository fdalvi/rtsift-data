Do not trust this jeweler!
The have the absolute worst customer service and over charge for their jewlery.
The also do terrible work on custom Peices.
I filled a BBB complaint and he still has yet to respond.
He never responded to the BBB complaint it is now closed and reflects a negative mark on his buisness  He did such a poor job on my custom necklace that I had to have another jeweler repair the pendent.
I did not trust him to fix it.
He did however agree to pay for the repair work on necklace.
Finally after 4months of dealing w/ this mess I have a completed necklace the way it is suppose to look.
I would not reccomend this jeweler to anyone!

I've been using this jeweler for years, and he's great.
I started going when my friend recommended him to me.
He's been very accommodating and honest over the years.

My husband found this place when looking for a specific ring for our wedding.
Troy found the stone and helped us design the perfect ring.
It's such a statement piece that almost every person I encounter comments on it, and it was very affordable, unlike other jewelers.
I was in again recently to have him clean it and he showed me the fancy new software he has to design rings with.
It may be a far drive but it's worth it!
