I hate that I loved this place!
After an afternoon of hiding from the heat in the Arrowhead mall, Ashley M. and I attempted several other chains in Arrowhead/83rd ave area that all had long lines outside before we came across Ajo Al's.
We walked in to the huge restaurant and were seated right away.
I loved the high ceilings and silly stereotypical Mexican decor.
Sombrero anyone?
We were then given the essential salsa and fresh tortilla chips (another reason I have a love/hate relationship with this place...) which just seemed to scream my name once they hit the table.
I ordered the Salad Carbon-Marinated grilled chicken grilled up and then layered over fresh salad greens and veggies with an avocado slice.
Topped with fresh onions and shredded cheese and served with Jalapeno-ranch dressing on the side.
As a salad connoisseur, I was expecting far less than the deliciousness which appeared before me.
The chicken was absolutely delicious and went great with the whole salad!
I was very pleased!
1 star removed for being a chain, and for not removing the calories from the tortilla chips.

My favorite Mexican restaurant in the Valley, and there are a bunch of good ones here.
The atmosphere is a little schlocky but still cool.
The service is usually top notch, and the food is terrific.
My wife gets the Salad Carbon - see the previous review.
I usually get the Pollo con Cheso - a chimi-style enchilada with a spicy white cream sauce.
Heaping portions with rice and beans that actually taste good.
5 Stars.

The food here is kind of pricey but you get what you pay for.
I love the chips and salsa here but I don't get why they serve their chips and salsa in weird containers that make it hard to eat.
It's so frustrating!
They also serve you your food piping hot so make sure to let it sit for a minute or else you are going to burn your mouth.
Other than that the servings are big and the food is great.

I was disappointed when we went here.
Could have been all the hype in the reviews so I had my expectations up.
My burrito tasted like onion soup.
My boyfriend was disappointed with his burrito too.
Wouldn't recommend going here.
Service was good, though.

If there was an option I would have given Ajo Al's 10 stars because they have amazing food at excellent prices!
The decorations are unique and the atmosphere is relaxing.
We visit this restaurant at least once a week and the service is always great!!!
This is a place you must visit!

i've been here several times now.
at first i wasn't sure how i felt about it.
it never seems to be very busy, but the service is always very polite and friendly.
the food i feel mixed about.
it's  GOOD.
the meat is always tender and the dishes are really flavorful, but i never really found anything that i LOVED.
and yet i continued wanting to go back and give it another try.
(the chips and salsa are really good -- and of course if you know me, you know that i like to mix the regular and the hot  for my perfect salsa).
nothing just really grabbed me.
their pork isn't shredded  like  i'm used to, they use pork loin which is good, but the consistency of it just doesn't seem to mix well with the food.
and the beef is super tender, but i just hadn't found my perfect mix of flavors yet.
until i tried the shrimp rellano.
so good!
i've been burned by rellanos in the past so i don't usually get them anymore.
this was the best rellano!
it was breaded perfectly (not too much like some places where the breading completely overwhelms the other flavors) and the cheese was super smooth and just oozed out.
delish!
and our server recommended something for the wee one that i didn't see on the kids  menu (i could have been totally blind) and he loved  it!
bonus!

first impression?
the couch in the waiting area is filthy and there's no hostess to be found.
we sat down and received chips and two salsa.
we also received two cups and a pitcher of water and then the nice lady walked away.
i guess we pour our own water?
ok.  not gonna lie, it was kinda messy.
we pretty much sucked at trying to pour water.
haha  everything on the menu was around $15 which was a bit shocking considering the no greeting, the self serve water and the dirty couch in the lobby.
i guess the feeling i got from the place i was expecting it would be closer to $10 menu items?
our waiter came out quickly and he was the only waiter on the floor.
he did surprisingly well.
i never felt like we were lacking when it came to needing something.
my steak fajitas were super tasty-  they let the veggies get crispy and there's nothing worse than soggy veggies.
the tortillas were amazing.
and overall i was happy with my dinner.
it was huge so that $15 plate did stretch for a few meals and it really was worth it because the quality is there for sure (i'm leaving out my complaint about the brownish quac and pale pico de gallo bc i didn't eat them and the fajitas were great on their own)  it was definitely a good choice for dinner.
it was a decent family owned restaurant.
i just wish the rest of the experience was relevant to the price of the food.
the food is worth the price but the rest was a bit off for me.
in the end- after tip it ended up being about $20 per person.
i would probably go again if i was in the area and needing some good mexican food.
other than that, probably not.
it was a-ok and if they upped the rest of the experience i would most definitely be a fan!

We go every week and the service and food are great.

Place is run by gossiping high-schoolers.
And what's even greater is you get to listen to all their petty drama while they hang out at the bar after their shift.
Name literally translates to "Garlic Al's" however its really named after a city in Arizona... not the herb, very disappointing.
Other then that, pretty standard Mexican.

We came here for Valentine's day because my husband's sprint phone was not working.
We drop off the phone and walked over for a quick bite.
We were lucky we got there before the crowd.
We waited for a few mins, before we were greeted and sat.
Within 15 mins, the place was packed with people.
We sat down and received a basket of warm chips and two salsa.
Then we got two cups and a pitcher of water.
The lady did not say anything to us and left.
I was not sure if she is coming back or not.
???
Then our server came to greet us.
She was very nice and told us the special.
She took our drink order and swoosh she was gone.
She had a ton of tables.
She came back quick with drinks and to take our food order.
I ordered the Comb #11 Chimi with chicken served with beans and rice.
The red sauce had good flavor, the chicken itself was bland, the rice was good, and normally I am not a fan of refried beans but theirs was pretty good.
To sum up everything, it was ok.

The Ajo Al's on 16th St has always been my home for good mexican food.
Until this place.. HOLY...
I love this place.
First off, the actual building is incredible.
Kudos to whomever designed this place.
It looks awesome.
Their chips are great along with the delicious salsa and hot sauce.
My only complaint is the last time I went , the chips were old tasting..
I could tell they gave me the bottom of the chip drawer.
I  love this place and will be coming back often!

A bunch of us go to dinner on Friday nights in the West Valley.
Last night / 4/8/2011 we went to Ajo Al's and had a great time and meal.
Thanks go to Isreal our waiter who was always attentive, there, helpful and a good sense of humor.
We will return.

To Marty F:  this place started as a Don Pablo's, a now defunct Tex-Mex chain.
this interior hasn't changed a bit since being taken over by Al's.
We go here frequently, mainly because of the extensive menu and the large variety of street tacos.
I can actually eat here and not blow my diet with all the grilled chicken options.
Their bean dip is exceptional and their drinks are good.
We have never had a bad meal here and go about 2-3 times a month.
Things they can improve upon:  Please don't sit my husband and myself next to a party with a crying toddler.
We don't like sitting by the kitchen because there sometimes are flies (yeah, big eew on those days).
And they could stand to touch-up the paint around the booths and do some deep cleaning.
This is a good, solid reliable place to eat that's a local chain.

I have always enjoyed Ajo Al's but don't live close to one so often choose to go other places.
On Sunday, I went for a late lunch craving the Pizza Nortena.
Unfortunately, because I am gluten free, the pizza isn't for me.
But, I mentioned it to our server and she came back to tell me that they could make it gluten free for me.
I had never even thought to ask but here she took the initiative to find out for me.
I haven't had that pizza in almost five years but I can tell you that it is still delicious even when modified with corn tortillas as the base.
The service was excellent.
Overall, this experience was my best one at any of the Ajo Al's locations.
On a side note, they have the best spicy cream cheese and their salsa is yummy.
If you enjoy Mexican, you will love Ajo Al's.

Love this place, good food, service and drinks....

Hi Yelpers!
I had lunch here w/my b/f today and don't plan on coming back.
We were completely disappointed in the food here.
First of all, we got seated in a tight booth, then a scary, bald headed bouncer looking guy wordlessly brought us some chips & a carafe of salsa (seriously?
a carafe for only 2 people??
), our food was served VERY oven hot, had to wait like 10 minutes before we could dig in.
Maybe waiting for the food to cool off wasn't the best idea because my ground beef and mashed potato style burrito plate covered in their red suiza style sauce started separating (pools of grease were forming on top of the sauce...very unappealing to say the least).
I thought I liked their spanish rice when I first tasted it, however it was too peppery.
The refried beans were probably canned.
For my burrito, I thought they'd use "papas" type of potatoes (those in N.M. know what I'm talking about!
), but it was like mashed potatoes stuffed in a burrito along with the ground beef.
The description didn't say they added in sliced jalapeno peppers...ugh, was unexpected and I just decided to choke it down.
My b/f's enchilada plate didn't fare well either.
Certainly nothing to write home about.
On a good note, we liked our beverages, iced tea and Pepsi.
How can you screw that up?
lol!
So yeah, we don't plan to return.
Just wanted to try something new in the neighborhood.
Better luck next time :)

I absolutely love this place when dining there.
But, we don't get to do that very often.
We have 4 kiddos, so we tend to order and pick up more often for a better dining experience.
Lol   The last 4 times we have ordered by phone for pick up, there has ALWAYS been a problem with the order.
Anywhere from missing 2 entire meals, to missing sides of beans or rice, to no chips and salsa and even wrong dinner order orders.
I am so frustrated with them.
Every time we call, they just say oops, we'll replace it next time.
I've officially given up with Ajo Al's.
Sad to say it, but they can only screw up so many times before losing my business.
And unfortunately, they don't do enough to make up for their mistakes.

When we arrived at Ajo Al's, I thought "Hmmmm, looks like a chain...probably pretty generic food.
"  However, it's a surprisingly good restaurant.
Their sauces and salsas are obviously house made and are interesting takes on traditional Mexican fare.
Thicker than most Mexican sauces, they are very flavorful.
We went for breakfast.
My huevos rancheros were very good.
Now, the eggs were a LITTLE overcooked to my liking in this dish, but other than that, this was a very good dish.
And you certainly won't walk away from this restaurant hungry - portion sizes are very large.
Our service was excellent.
Our waiter was attentive and available to knowledgeably answer all our questions.
Refills were prompt on water, chips and salsa.
He was also right there when the first Coronas were gone to see if we'd like another round.
Very festive atmosphere.
All-in-all, a very good experience food wise and service wise.

Just ate at this shit box, Ajo Al's in Glendale.
Very disappointed in our dinning experience.
I wish I'd have read some of the reviews before going.
The only positive I have is that the interior was aesthetically pleasing.
Completely downhill from there.
We ordered two margaritas, on the rocks, with two shots of Grand Marnier.
It took at least 10 minutes to get our drinks and the shots of Grand Marnier were only a 1/2 oz.
each.
We had to request a full one oz.
shot, and wait another 10 minutes for it to transpire.
The food was nothing spectacular, if not overpriced.
At the end of the meal we ordered two more margaritas, this time melon, and again a we waited.
Our empty plates and glass wear were never cleared from the table.
When we left, the remanence from everything we ordered was still on the table, and everything took exceedingly long... Do not waist your time and money if you are expecting any kind of good dining experience.
I've had better "generic brand salsa", and I doubt if they even know what a jalapeno is.

Decided to give it another try after not visting in over 5 years due to poor service.
Once again it proved I will not be back for probably another 5 years for the same reason.
Seeing as it was Memorial Day weekend there was less than four tables seated at the time we came for dinner.
We were promptly greated by the hostess and seated.
The waitress arrived a short time later and took a drink order and dinner order.
We waited about 5 minutes before the drinks arrived and then after another 5 minutes we had to ask about chips and salsa and if they still offered it as a part of the service.
The waitress essentially forgot about us and I had to constantly look around to get the attention of the staff who was having a social hour at the front desk.
Then our waitress would return and with a piss poor attitude, "is there something you need?
"  The drinks were not refilled in a timely manner and when the food arrived the waitress said, "careful, hot plate" and practically threw it in front of my wife (the plate actually slide across the table a few inches!!).
The food overall was good but the piss poor service is going to kill this place!
In seeing as she had probably one table at the time to help this was completely unacceptable.
I think towards the end of the meal she realized how bad she must have been because she stopped by the table a few more times.
In closing, I feel that if I am going to spend $50 on a meal the service had better not be what I would expect to recieve at McDonalds!
** TWO STARS for the food!
**  ** ZERO STARS for the service!

After trying the Ajo Al's on 16th street and Camelback, we decided to drop into the one closer to our home which is this location!!
We again were pleasantly surprised by how much we enjoyed our time.
The waiter was nice, the food was hot, and again (in my other review on Ajo Al's) our beer was cold and wonderful.
Also loved the decor!!
Very open and a lot of natural light during the day!

This is a family owned and operated restaurant.
We started with golden margaritas they arrived and almost tasted good but it was like drinking half water and half drink.
I didn't care for either salsa, one was smooth tomato puree that was just very hot and the other fresh tomato one was very watery and smooth with barely any flavor like the margaritas.
I ORDERED a grilled CHICKEN salad.
As my luck would have it the waiter presents me with a grilled BEEF salad.
I didn't say anything and just accepted it.
The salad really was OK with grilled mushrooms and some onions the beef was OK but not seasoned.
I was afraid to use the dressing that came with it because it was bubbling a bit.
My husband had a platter with steak, sauce, onions, fresh roasted jalapeño and cheese all melted up with rice and beans, he said it was good.
We got good and not so good.
2.5 stars

It's like On the Border with a bit more soul and less salt.
Family and I dined in once and took out once.
We got the chicken taco salad each time.
Comes with chips and salsa (even with takeout--nice touch!
) and jalapeno ranch dressing.
You get a taco shell bowl stuffed with REAL chicken (not the processed bits you typically receive at chains), cheese, and veggies.
Tasted fresh and was very filling.
Great meal for hungry dieters (particularly if you forego the bulk of the shell).

Stopped in here at lunch time today for a first visit to this location.
It's a lovely place, & more to my liking than their restaurant on 16th St.
This one features very nice up to date decor, high ceilings, & there was plenty of light coming into the dining area without any glare.
Excellent chips arrived at my comfortable booth in short order, with a generous serving of mild tomato salsa in a carafe, as well as a small cup of hot salsa, which I added some of to the mild to get it right up to the preferred spiciness.
My server also brought a whole pitcher of ice water; another nice touch.
I ordered a #7 Combo, consisting of a Chile Relleno, a beef tamale, & a shredded beef taco.
It came with refried beans & some shredded lettuce salad, all stylishly presented on a piping hot platter.
The three main items were LARGE & delicious.
I thought the slightly above average price for this meal was justified, & really enjoyed having lunch here!
:-))  #7 Combo $11.45

This is my favorite Mexican food place in the area, hands down.

Rarely am I ever this disappointed with a place...All of it - the food, service, and experience.
Given that it had 3 1/2 stars, that usually tells me a place is worth checking out.
Not this place.
All minuses.
I have to say I agree with Ryan N and the other reviewers' not so positive experiences.
My friend and I wanted to try something out in the Arrowhead area and I am even the one to want to give it a chance.
Family owned is always a pull for me.
We first started with the Spice Jalapeno Bean Dip.
NOT spicy at all.
All it was was a big bowl of refried beans with a few Jalapeno pieces in it.
Ok, not happy but at least we have the meal still to go so I wasn't going to be bothered too much.
First strike.
The wait for our food was unusually long which is worth it if the food was good and had care put into it.
There was nothing special or dif.
that should have made the wait that long.
The place was not busy.
It was only a third full.
Second strike - since the food was not worth the wait.
I ordered the Tacos Morongo.
It specifically says that they use HANDMADE corn tortillas which was the sole reason for me ordering them.
When I got my meal, they were definitely NOT handmade.
Hmmm...ok...so I decided to try it still.
Eh.
Not horrible but for the long wait, definitely not great at all.
Mediocre.
Third strike  My friend got the steak fajitas.
It was more like veggie fajitas.
It was so bombarded with green and red peppers that you couldn't SEE the meat.
We found 5 pieces.
Ok, maybe where they lack in qty, they make up for quality.
Sorry, no go.
Fourth Strike.
What put the icing on the cake (in a horrible way) was the waitress and how she handled things.
The next time she came by our table, I was already done with 1 1/2 tacos.
She asked how it was.
What happened next just about put me over the edge.
She asked how we were doing but was WALKING AWAY to another table as she did.
I am sure she expected the typical "fine".
I asked her why it didn't come with handmade tortillas.
She started babbling reasons.
I then calmly told her how I was very disappointed that it didn't come with them and that it was the sole reason I got them.
All she said was "I'm Sorry" all while still WALKING AWAY!
I don't need the world given to me or even a comped meal but it would have been nice if she actually stopped, cared or tried to make things right like bring me the handmade tortillas.
Fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth strike.
I'd let Ajo Al's know but their website doesn't give you any way to write them.
I usually give the benefit of the doubt but with the strikes coming for all sorts of reasons, I just can't.

I went to Ajo Als Arrowhead with my children on 1/13/13 evening after a very long weekend and looking forward to a great meal.
After waiting behind several other patrons for at least 3 minutes for someone to notice that there was no host/hostess we were seated.
Our waiter was Travis.
Travis took our order and after serving the food never returned to check on us.
I had the green enchiladas, one child had the red enchiladas and the other had a hamburger.
My food literally tasted like nothing.
My sons hamburger was dry.
After not being approached by the waiter, I begrudgingly ate half of an enchilada.
When he delivered the check I told him it was not good.
He said "so you dont want a to-go box?
" I went to the front desk to speak to the manager or get a business card, however no one was there (waited again about 3 min).
Today I called to obtain the managers email address (Jose Nava) but Travis answered the phone and stated I needed to call back after 4.
I do not have time to take up this cause, but when budgets are tight and dinner out is an occasional family treat, it is imperative that we expect great food and excellent customer service.
Try Mixteca down the street.
Not the best, but much better and cheaper.

There is nothing Vegan friendly here.

ok food cool interior and nice server will be back for sure!

Oh, Ajo Al's.
You have deleted items off of your menu and try as I may I cannot find anything that i like in what remains.
Add to that an extremely lackluster server on our last visit and it will be a VERY long time before i return.
It's the small stuff like checking back in a timely fashion and not just saying "i'll SEE if i can get that taken off for you" since i clearly only had two or three bites.
and then as you're halfway to the kitchen remember to come back and ask me if there's anything else i want.
Don't drop the check before asking if we want dessert.
We did, but we went out for frozen yogurt instead since you had already dropped the check off.

Awesome machaca burror with the brown sauce..Yum.
We love it.
Why is Macayo's busy when there is Ajo Al.s down the road.
Macayo's is worse than Taco Bell..Wake up people ..

Love the red chile!!

Not as great as it used to be but still some of the better Mexican food you'll get in the northwest valley.

Decided to try this place on a whim and oh what a mistake it was.
Just about the worst Mexican food I've ever had.
My chicken tacos were bland and I almost needed a magnifying glass to see them.
My boyfriend's chicken enchilada tasted like something my mom would have punished me with when I was little.
Service was horrible (they forgot my drink and got my boyfriend's order wrong).
All I got out of my trip there was some leftovers for my dog and a whole lot of gas.

Very dissappointed with the customer service.
Went there on Friday, 11/15/13 with my family.
The waitress spent most of her time trying to upsale.
She encouraged us to get extra cream cheese with out pollo con queso (in which we ordered 3).
We did, and of course we were charged for the extra cream cheese.
My son ordered the kids meal and I explained to her that it comes with a free drink.
She already inputted the charge and stated that she would speak with her manager.
She never removed the item from the bill.
Normally, we overtip on our bill.
We usually leave approximately 15% if the service was poor.
We left an $11 tip on our bill that was $70.44 ($81.44 after tip) due to the poor service.
I checked my bank account today and noticed that our waitress added an extra $1.
Total amount charged was $82.44.
Ajo Al's just lost a customer for life.

Ajo Al's, whether in Scottsdale or Arrowhead, always an amazing meal.
Great drinks, food, and values.
Never let's me down on quality.

Disappointing!
Friends have told me how great food is here.
I had the beef chimichanga and it was soo salty!
I couldn't finish my food.
I ended up filling up on chips and salsa.
The food wasn't even worth taking a picture of.

My Phoenix friend and I had visitors to the valley from Michigan and British Columbia so we decided to take them out for a Mexican meal.
The chips and salsa were just ok, the chips actually tasted stale.
The meal was quite good.
My friend and I had the pollo con queso.
Very good with two of the crisp chicken burro's with beans and rice.
Enough on the plate to share with someone else.
My biggest complaint is the price of the drinks.
I am accustomed to ordering a frozen strawberry margarita and paying anywhere from $4-6 non happy hour.
My friend and I ordered a frozen strawberry margarita each and the price was $17.00 for the two.
I was flabbergasted!!
$8.50 for a margarita??
I didn't ask for any high end tequila just the standard house margarita.
I have never paid anything close to $8.50 for a margarita anywhere in the valley and I have been to quite a few different Mexican restaurants.
I would have given a higher rating but the booze prices are ridiculous here.
I suggest going during happy hour and getting your meal in the bar as well, because we were told in the dining room that happy hour prices are only in the bar area.

Had you asked me to write the review after my first visit I would have given three stars.
Now that we have been back for a second stop, it has dropped to a 2 star experience.
Biggest plus - the chips are hot fresh and the salsas are tasty.
However, the entress are just a soupy mess of sauce, beans, rice and whatever you ordered.
It seems they plate the food, then throw it under a broiler or heat lamp to perfectly melt everything into one congealed mess.
Flavor is jsut ok, as the two stars say, "meh, I've experienced better.
"  Still on the quest for a better upscale Mexican Dinning experience.
Somewhere where they rice and beans are not one big mess covered in sauce and sour cream.
Somewhere where they take the time to plate a nice plate of food.

Pollo Con Queso !!

It was ok.
Nothing outstanding.
Kind of a let down after being told it was really good.

They made my order wrong, it took so long for the waitress to come by and me to tell her that it was wrong, that everyone else at my table was almost done eating.
I told her that I ordered it without onions because I am allergic to them, and they put onions in it.
I asked her to please have them make my new order to go as everyone else was just about done eating.
I discovered there were onions in it on my third bite, it took everything I had to not get sick all over the table.
Our server told us when she brought the check and my food that they had a new chef and he doesn't read the tickets all the way through.
I am going to be sick most of the night because of his laziness.
I was really shocked and disappointed when I looked at the bill and saw that they not only didn't take my meal off the menu, they didn't even discount it!
I felt so disappointed that this restaurant that I had loved for so many years would treat me so poorly that I just paid the bill and left the replacement meal there.
I will never return and I would not recommend them to anyone.
If you want good Mexican food  in that area, try Mexteca or PoPo's.

Went for dinner here on a Friday night.
Had a bit of confusion to start the evening (the hostess forgot about us) but the manager comped our appetizer for being forgotten I'm the lounge.
We had the jalapeño bean dip.
Thought it would be spicier but still delicious.
Next I had Tacos carbon.
Very tasty and well prepared.
Wife had a combo plate and she liked it has well.
All in all, a solid visit.
I'll be back!

Went here for lunch today & wasn't really impressed.
Ordered jalapeno bean dip for a starter & it was tasty though it seemed to take a while to get something so simple.
Ordered something from the lunch menu.
It was a chicken enchilada with jalapeno cheese sauce.
It didn't come with much cheese sauce & the enchilada was really wet.
It didn't seem like grease, more like water or something.
It was just unappetizing, though the taste was alright.
Husband ordered pollo con queso which was good.
One of the few reasons this review gets three stars.
Decor was nice too.
Oh & the bathroom was smelly.
Overall, not worth another visit.

My wife and I came here for our first time and were not disappointed!
The only negative thing I have to say is the chips were a little too greasy.
Amazing beans and rice and so much flavor in the steak fajita!
The cheese enchilada was the best I've ever had and of course we got a fried ice cream!
Amazing!
2 thumbs up for Ajo Al's!

No wait on a Friday night?
That explains why food was just okay.
Will not return anytime soon.
As a side note service was good but why wouldn't it be as place was so dead.

It's not that the food is particularly bad, but it irks me as a vegetarian that they list dishes as a vegetarian special that they knowingly have meat in.
Even their rice is cooked with meat.

Dead on a Friday night.
No wonder!
Food was bland with no flavor including the salsa.
Service was good but that's the only positive.
I have been in the area for seven years and this is my first time visiting.
I haven't missed a thing!
Skip this place!
