Hubby likes going here for their "strippers" and cheap happy hour, so we've gone a few times now.
They have a cool bar set up (with plenty of TVs) but honestly the service has been less than stellar each time we've gone (and by "less" I mean like not even close).
Service is slow (we're talking molasses) and not that friendly.
The food is tasty (we've had their strippers & sandwiches), and the happy hour is good.
But other than that, I would wholeheartedly give the place an "A-OK" and not much more than that.

I nominate myself as the Pity Customer of The Day.
Don't get me wrong... the Kraut Dogs were super big and tasty, the curley fries were not bad (bit greasy, but it's fries ya know?
) but....  the instant I got sat, it was like I was forgotten.
No (assigned) waiter came to my table.
Instead, a waiter passed by and felt pity on me and took my order.
When I got my dog I asked for napkins and he then disappeared.
Nobody asked me how I was doing.
Ok Ok, so the manager came by and finally got me napkins.
By then I just wanted to leave because I was just ignored.
If you like lots of plasma tv's (lost count of how many there are), food to eat while you're watchn' your game, then this is the place for you!
I haven't tried their pizza, will have to do that next time.
Maybe I'll have better service if I brought Kris.

Ok, so this place has somewhat redeemed itself.
Waitress could be a little friendlier, but I was sat promptly and the timing of food was actually good today.
I had the Cobb salad (substituted the bleu cheese with cheddar), but the blend of ice berg lettuce, avocado, bits of boiled eggs, bacon, cheddar cheese, tomatoes and ranch dressing was pretty yummy... only thing I would change is to add some dark greens (like spinach) in there please!!
3.5/5!

The service at this location is always good.
The specials on wings are great on Thursday nights.
The reuben sandwich is my favorite however, very flavorful.
Their curly fries with cheese added are not to be missed.
Food is always hot, quick, and good.
Their mozzarella sticks are the best I have ever had, they are flavorfull and a lot of cheese with a light batter.
Yum!

I am a huge fan of Native New Yorker.
However, this location does not live up to the others sadly.
The wings were good but the curly fries with cheese were barely edible.
The cheese was watery and the fries were mussy somehow.
They usually have the best fries!
I highly recommend the Signal Butte location.
This one just didn't live up to it.
My mom was with me and said her sandwich was really good as usual but again, her fries were worse than mine.
He fries didn't seem to even be cooked all the way but were still mushy which I don't even know how you accomplish.
Service was good.
Atmosphere is a little more open and "lighter" than the other locations which I really liked.

We hadn't been to native in ages and used to be regulars.
Last night we had a disappointing experience.
The server was horrendous.
We heard everyone around us being told about the nightly special and hh specials... we weren't told of any specials.
She asked what we wanted to drink, I asked if they have IPA and received a five second uncomfortable blank stare.
My salt and pepper wings were drowning in grease (I literally squeezed them with napkins) but seemed they would have otherwise been delicious.
She checked on us for the first time when we were almost finished.
My husband devoured two dozen hot wings and was pleased which is why I am giving two stars.
Next time- take out for hubby and I'll run to chipotle!

tried chicken bacon ranch bruschetta for appitizer.
very good..will get that again tried the smokehouse sandwich.
not to impressed.
will not eat that one again.
like the grill chicken breast ..maybe it was the fried onion strings..not sure.. usually get a burger.

I went to Native New Yorker to pick up a pizza to go.
After the girl at the cash register helped three people who came in after me...I finally ordered and had a seat to wait.
During my wait I learned a lot.
I learned that the hostess station is where all the waitstaff get together to openly badmouth the customers that are currently eating.
I learned that the waitstaff also uses the hostess station to play grab ass.
I also learned that it was a lovely girls first night working at NNY.
She came in and advised the hostess of this and was greeted by the hostess with an enthusiastic and high pitched welcome.
After the new girl walked away to start her new job the hostess rolled her eyes, scoffed and poured out a slew of hateful, mean, hostile and curse ridden comments about the new girls appearance.
At this point my pizza was ready and I was more then ready to leave.
NNY is getting 2 stars because the pizza was subpar compared to the other slop that locals try to pass off as pizza here in AZ.

We have not been to native in quiet a long time.
We decided to go to here and the service was horrible.
The food was just ok.  We tried to mention to the manage of the bad service and it seem to go in one ear and out the other.
The bar area is very loud and the bartender and service in the bar area was aweful.
They are very rude and just seem very uninterested in waiting on tables.
I would rather make the drive elsewhere to have better service than at this place!
If you can avoid it, that would be my suggestion.

Came here on Friday with to meet up with friends.
Our bartender was totally on it and was really friendly.
I told him to surprise me and make me a great drink, he sure did!
I loved them.
Would come here again!
We didn't have food, so I can't speak to that, but the drinks were on point!

New to the area and we like this place pretty well.
I like their wings, especially the ones that are boneless like strips.
Its a pretty casual laid back atmosphere, sports bar style.
We go with our kids though all the time.
They run pretty good specials on Tues and Thursdays.
We've had pretty good service each time we've gone.

Service is slow, but food is alright.
Not many options beyond burgers and wings.

I have been coming to Native New Yorker for over twenty years.
They still have the best wings in the valley.
My only reason for four stars instead of five is the wings being too expensive anymore.
Service is always fast and friendly.

This location is a little out of the way for me but I have gone there twice for karaoke night.
It was a lot of fun and not too crowded.
The crowd is very friendly and not that intimidating for potential first time karaoke goers.
As always the food was great and the beer was cold.

The service was good.
The waitress was nice and pleasent.
However the wings came out wrong.
After they brought us the correct wings they where then cold.
This happened with 2 of our orders of wings.

Last night we went to this location.
It was relatively slow.
We were seated a couple of minutes after getting there.
Our waiter came over to get our drinks.
We all ordered water with the intent to eat some hit wings.
I ordered 12 wings and a side of fries.
Took about 30 minutes or so when our food came out.
My wings and fries were so disappointing.
They were luke warm and became cold pretty fast.
Everyone else at the table said their food was cold as well.
While I probably could have ate my wings before they got completely cold, I was too busy trying to wave down the waiter to refill all of our waters.
I would understand if it was busy or we were a big party but that was not the case.
The management needs to take some tips from the Dobson Location because that's how your establishment should run.
I live near this location but if I ever want Natives wings, I'll be sure to drive a few miles to the Dobson location.

Unless you are a regular here you will not get the service that all the other regulars get.
First off our waitress was awful.
The food was ok but not good.
I would suggest to avoid this place if you can.
We spoke to the manger about the service but apparentlynsince he did not know us it went in one ear and out the other.
Avoid if you can there is an Applebee close by go there!

Dinner was fine .
3 of us for dinner  bacon ranch flatbread appetizer *** California burger with fries *** Garbage Pizza **** House calzone ** (top crust crispy, bottom soggy from the beginning.. ) Service was good, we will return.

The service was good.
I had a Cobb Salad.
Overall, it was a good salad and the bleu cheese dressing was very good, but the bacon on the salad was completely RAW.
Sorry, I find that to be unacceptable.
I removed the bacon and ate the rest of the salad.
I say: consumer beware.

Tried a Native New Yorker in Mesa when I first moved to the valley in 2010.
Wasn't too impressed so never returned until recently, where we tried this location.
This site was nice and new, I liked that.
Bacon ranch chicken flatbread was very good, but that's where the fun ended.
Service was a tad slow, and food came out ...just warm.
By the time I was halfway through the dish it was cold.
Looking at other reviews this seems to be a trend.
On the plus side the wing sauces were good.
Also, don't be fooled...their "BUFFALO" style fish sliders are nothing more than a fried fish sandwich with cayenne pepper sprinkled on top.
Based on our experience it may be another four years until we try nny again.

Always clean :) the service is a tad slow each time I come but enough TVs and trivia keep you distracted from the wait..... And good company of course.
Different days have different specials so that's nice as well.

One on the worst places i have ate while living in az.
5 people ate for $65.00 what a joke, $5 for a small plate of fries,$9 for 12 wings and so on.
Food quality was horrible and so was the price.
Wish i would have read some reviews before going, if this is a franchise they are not keeping up just hope others are not like this.
Someone from the health department needs to be called .

I came to this place just to catch some wings nothing extraordinary we thought.
We had a coupon since my husband and I moved in the area not long ago.
I just gotta say that service was out of this orbit great.
Since we opened the door the manager that was leaving for the day greeted and welcomed us very friendly.
And then the server was nothing but sweet and checked up on us regularly instead of abandoning us.
The manager also came and checked the table and at the end the server pre bussed the table promptly for us to enjoy a little time after dinner instead of leaving us with our plates all dirty.
I got a wedge salad and some wings.
My husband got a Philly steak.
We were really pleased.
Great prices too.
:) we will be back.
Thank you Sami.
We will definitely look for your station whenever we make it back.
