This is the first time I have used Jim, and I can say that it will not be the last time.
His pricing is fair, his work is excellent, and he arrives when he says he will.
Jim is extremely courteous and respectful.
I would recommend him to anyone.
Thanks Jim!!

I had a water leak in the garage and needed to replace the drywall.
I thought about doing it myself, but after the demolition I was not in the mood to do the drywall, that is when I called in Jim.
Jim came out and gave me a quote better than all the rest.
He was prompt, courteous and honest.
He finished on time and on budget.
No hidden surprises.
He even went above and beyond by going back to home depot to get the paint tinted to match the existing garage wall.
His finished work looked great.
I will definitely  be calling Jim for any future drywall jobs, and first on my list for everything else.
