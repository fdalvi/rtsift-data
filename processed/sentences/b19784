Double Overtime Sports Grill is great....I have ordered take out from here twice.
The first time I ordered the Patty Melt with sweet potato fries.
I asked for it medium...is was just a little over done, but the fries are great!
The second time I ordered the pulled pork sandwich...Amazing...I really like the BBQ sauce that comes on this, it is sweet.
I also got the sweet potato fries.....I am a big fan...
So if you are in the neighborhood stop in and grab some grub..
I work in the area, so it is very convenient, and the food is prepared in a very timely manner.
The staff is good, I haven't sat down to eat there, but for take out the service was great!

Great neighborhood sports bar.
They've got something like 35 HD TV's  all arranged so you can get a good view no matter where you sit.
The staff is friendly, drinks are inexpensive (like $10.00 for 1 beer and 2 vodka/soda), and their food is tasty.
They have a large comfy outdoor seating area if you want to catch some fresh air.
My only complaint about this place is on the weekends they usually have a cover band... not that the band is terrible or anything (i think they switch it up so it's  not always the same band anyway), but they're loud and if you're there to watch a game, forget about hearing anything relating to the game, including the people you are with.
I can see how this could go either way with people since it does add kinda a rockin' environment, which is nice, depending on your mood.
Oh and they have those satellite speaker things so you have this box at your table and you can tune the sound to whichever game you're interested in listening to, not that it matters when the band is playing, but every other time it's cool.

awesome for sports.
real nice hd tvs everywhere.
college football is perfect here..ask for an audio box to hear commentators, but who cares about their boring comments about the obvious.
blue cheese burger was good.
