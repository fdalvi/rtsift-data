I needed to fax a pretty large document and stopped by here to get it done.
The old guy working the counter was pretty cool and took care of it, watching every page (23 pages) go through the fax machine, one by one, to make sure nothing went wrong.
Since it was a very important document, I'm very thankful for his personal attention.
I wish he wore a name tag so I could give him props.....he probably owns the joint.
I don't live nearby, so the chances I'll return are pretty low, but that is not indicative of the service here.
Return Factor - 20%

The older gentleman referred to in the other reviews is the owner.
I have a mailbox there so I see how rude and condescending he is with most customers on a daily basis.
Too bad he doesn't enjoy his job more.

I had a very unpleasant experience.
The guy behind the counter was rude.
I was asking basic questions about how to obtain a UPS shipping label.
He kept saying it was my problem and that he was a franchise owner, not actually UPS.
He was no help and was trying to make me feel lowly.
Horrible experience

I don't remember the last time I received such horrible customer service.
The older gentleman (and I use that term loosely) was downright rude and not helpful in answering routine questions.
I typically avoid self-service kiosks, but that would have been a much more pleasant experience...Then again, so would spraying lemon juice in my eye and trying to rub it out with a serrano pepper!
Go out of your way to avoid this establishment or take your business to another carrier if possible.
