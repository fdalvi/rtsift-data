I've used the printing company in downtown scottsdale many times.
I've been absolutely thrilled with every order.
The staff is helpful, knowledgable and friendly.
Your projects get personalized attention unlike other larger printing companies.
Joe and his staff offer great marketing ideas and can walk you through from start to finish.
They're easy to find.
Just south of Indian School on Miller Rd in the Regal Rags shopping center.
(Across from OLPH).

The company I work for uses them and is very happy with their services and professionalism.

My work needed some professional printing done, so we went seeking help on Yelp and found out that The Printing Co. has the one of the best review out of many other printing companies in Metro Phoenix area.
To make the story short, we dealt with Larry directly all via e-mail communications and he's very professional and he took time to show us what our options are and how much it cost to print this and that.
The turnaround time was a bit long because we needed a special paper to print what we needed, but overall quality and services are just outstanding.
I would definitely recommend you to go check out The Printing Co., you won't be disappointed.
