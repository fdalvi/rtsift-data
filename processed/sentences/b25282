This place is worn out.
Calling it a country club is a bad name for country clubs.

Greens ok.
But this place is just not worth the money.
Lots of mud and the fairways are in very very bad shape.
Portable sprinklers all over the place.
Fairways littered with so many leaves that it makes it tough to fine your golf balls even if your on the fairway.

I just spent the day at Ahwatukee cc started with an awesome breakfast burrito, Mr. Becher was able to get me out for 18 quickly, had a great experience and enjoyed the practice facility
