Excellent service, new business and the food is great.
Excellent choices for pizza, calzones, pasta dishes and sandwiches.
They are next to Starbucks, facing south towards the theater.
Would recommend them to anyone.

Wow, just ordered a pizza from Bella Pizza and the girl who answered the phone made me feel like I was interrupting her evening.
I have ordered several pizzas from here and they are good but I guess they don't realize that the person who answers the phone is the voice of the company.

There is no trace of this place.
I found this restaurant last night thru Yelp, ordered online to pick up, paid, drove, no Bella...instead a different restaurant is there.
Nearby businesses said they pulled stakes.
What a waste of time and effort!
