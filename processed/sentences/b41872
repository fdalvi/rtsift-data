I have tested several restaurant for Kobbideh Kebob menu and I can definitely say that this place serves the best Koobideh I have ever had.
Don't miss their wraps they are really delicious and the price is amazing!
you can have a chicken wrap for only 3.99$+tax!

great taste, generous portions, comfortable atmosphere.
excellent value.
so far i've tried their koobideh, joojeh and chenjeh, which are fantastic.
when you get the platter w/ rice, you'll still get salad, so you won't leave hungry.
the tomatoes are roasted so nicely too.
they really cover their bases with everything and leave you satisfied.

Best Kebob ever!
This restaurant offers variety of Persian dishes at a reasonable price.
Totally recommended.

great food, good service and charming staff.. been here a couple times so far and was never disappointed... K/W finally has a great persian restaurant...

This is a new restaurant, beware the other reviews as management has flooded Yelp with over twelve 5+ reviews (all posted on June 10/11?
Really?).
Weekday lunch: Service is friendly, but slow - there was only one person in charge of doing everything and it took longer than expected despite there only being 3 customers total.
The owner likes to talk to people, no problem with that.
The $3.99 beef wrap is a good deal for its size.
It was smaller than average and greasy, but definitely good value for the amount paid.
Confusingly, veggie and chicken wraps are more expensive ($4.49 and $4.99 respectively - a veggie wrap more expensive than beef wrap!?
)  Overall, 4 stars for good value after considering cost.
Food had more taste than the more expensive Shawerma Plus ($8.69 incl.
fries + drink) nearby, but was definitely smaller, greasier and unhealthier....   No posted menu, only the delivery menus so it is confusing when you first walk in where to order from.
