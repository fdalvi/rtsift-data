My cousins and I saw the sign for this place while driving, and it boasted 350 flavors of tabacco.
What the hell?
That's crazy-talk.
We stopped by, I'm pretty sure all of the employees were Native American.
Come to think of it, I'm pretty sure this is the border of a reservation, since the Casino was a stone's throw away.
Plus, ya know, the name of the place.
We were carded right away, because apparently this 26 yr old looks 17.
The place was packed!
And, there's a drive-thru!
There really are 350 different flavors of tobacco here.
I didn't count, but I'm almost sure of it.
My friend bought some flavored cigars, because it said Al Capone smoked them on the box.
They have cool lighters too.
Maybe I was just in awe because I don't see shops like this in San Diego.
What a tourist.

This place has everything you cancer lovers need.
Plus, no sales tax.
Aww yeeahh.

Love the drive-thru.
Trucked it on thru tonite and rolled out in less than 4 minutes with my super cheap carton of Marlboros and a smile on my face.
The lady at the window was awesome and funny.
Why pay more for name-brand cancer?

I'm not a smoker.
But my visitors are.
We were used to driving all the way up to SRPMIC for cheaper smokes until we found this shop - WAY closer!
Much more than carton cigarettes - loose tobacco, supplies, cigars ...  Nicer shop!
Great prices!
No sales tax!
And a drive through (although was not open at the time we visited) ... worth the trip.

Love the price of cigarettes, but as soon as I walked in the door an older women workin there stairs at me then walks up asks me for I'd so I went to hand it to her and she snatched it out of my hand.
She then gave me a very dirty look because my I'd is a California I'd.
I walk up to counter to tell the other girl wat I wanted, and she had an attitude as well... Prices are great, but the people that work there are extremely rude.
I'd rather pay the extra 3$ and go to a gas station.
