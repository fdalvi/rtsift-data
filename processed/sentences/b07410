My husband and I have been going to Mr. Duskin for four years and this year we had to cut corners somewhere and we decided to try H & R Block because of their sale.
We got back money this year.
A lot of money.
We have realized that Mr. Duskin doesn't give you the tax breaks you should get.
And who knows - maybe after you leave he pockets your tax check.
If you're a young looking female, he digs into your personal life and makes weird comments, like when are you having kids?
why don't you make more money?
Like he understands - ha!
He is a creepy, squirrely guy that seems to shrink into his large chair more and more each year.
He also overcharges - $150 for a joint filing.
I will return to H & R Block next year.

Robert Duskin and his staff are extremely hardworking financial experts.
He is one of the more experienced accountants in the area and is well respected in the business community.
He is a sincere gentleman with a high level of integrity.

Duskin & Duskin have been our accountant for more than 15 years - two corporate returns and a personal return.
They are awesome.
Even though I am always last minute getting my financial data to them, they always crank out the returns in a timely manner and never give me a hard time about it.
They also answer any questions that I have in a very timely manner.
Very professional and highly recommend.
