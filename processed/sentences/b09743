Never have I thought that flowers could make me feel glamourous....until Desert Rose.
This is truly what a call a talented, customer oriented florist, constantly updated on the latest floral trend and ultimately the wow factor...endless wows and bow wows for that matter!
The floral presentations and arrangements made by Desert Rose are truly works of arts, almost so exceptionally beautiful that I wish I could immortalize their arrangements they make for me, so I could keep them and cherish them forever.
Thank you Desert Rose, for bringing joy, smiles and eternal glamour.
You always manage to brighten my day and melt my stress and breath away!

This is a Great Local Florist in Carefree and in Scottsdale too.
You really can trust them for quality and service.
The owners are very nice and the selections are great.
It smells so wonderful in their shops.
Beautiful displays!
Great prices too.

I ordered the After The Rain bouquet for my Mother's birthday and its was truly gorgeous.
They also completed it in less than 2 hours after I submitted my online order.
I will be using them in the future.
