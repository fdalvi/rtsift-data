Amazing food!
Try the Italian and Mediterranean wrap...Vegetarian and oh so good.
Lola also makes so many other amazing things - ask her for what is new - like poutine, and fried cheesecake!

Who knew gourmet could be hitched on a trailer?
Lola D's is a full-scale production kitchen on wheels.
The owners and chefs de cuisine, Michele and John, are truly the coolest people with a serious knack for good eats.
My favorite is the Thai One On wrap (I'm sure you're intrigued).
And, the fries, oh my!
If you've never had a food truck experience, start here - and I guarantee you'll agree it's the best!

At Saturday Night Truck Stop the other night Lola D's Poutine Traditional (Fresh Cut French fried potatoes with cheese curds and chicken gravy) as seen in the pic.
was absolutely the BOMB!
If you do not know what this is or have ever tasted their Poutine, it is a must.
I have had several now at Lola's including their Poutine Italian, Meatloaf Poutine, Poutine Chile and of course the Poutine Traditional.
Simple flavors blended and served to create and amazing taste and hardy meal.

I had them twice now (about 6 months apart) and actually ordered the same items (as their photos of their other items werent very appealing).
I ordered their grilled cheese with hot dog/sausage.
I liked the idea of the sandwich more then actually eating it.
You would think after eating it the first time and not enjoying the grease of the oil coating my mouth, that I wouldn't subject myself to eating it a second time (even if it was 6 months apart) - I blame my fiance!
I rather make this sandwich at home where I can control how much oil/butter to use just to make the bread toasted... toasted bread does not mean you need enough oil to grease your mouth and your fingers...
