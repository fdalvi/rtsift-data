I found this hidden gem while trolling for food.
What?!?
A gun store on the EASTCYDE?!?
The store faces away from Nellis, so it's easy to miss.
I was fortunate enough to purchase my conceal and carry from here.
The price was the same as what it used to be before the price gouging.
I saw the same firearm at other spots at $200 more.
I'm glad that Dave, the gun store owner, is being reasonable.
I also bought some .308 rounds which wasn't too bad.
Finding inexpensive .308 is always a chore for me.
He did mention that he re-loads.
I know he re-loads 45ACP and .308.
I didn't ask what other calibers he re-loads.
His .308 re-loads come out to the average to what I was paying for.
I will definitely be a future customer here.
The store is a quiet little shop with very good owners.
Dave is easy to talk to and very informative.
He answered every question I had on some of the firearms I was interested in and he was very friendly.
Great customer service, and very reasonable prices.
If you're on the EASTCYDE and in the market for a new toy, stop by On Target Guns and give Dave and Donna a visit.

This firearm store is very friendly and helpful.
I bought my first firearm here and they were very patient showing me everything about it.
Everyone in here is extremely nice and not annoying and up in your face like a lot of people.
They always have ammo in stock and have a lot of accessories.
I would recommend this place to everyone looking for a new gun or just accessories and ammo for the ones you have, you won't be disappointed.

I went in there last April just looking and comparing guns and prices.
I went to another gun shop fully convinced of a specific gun.
Well when I went in here they showed me all of their 9mm pistols and let me compare them all.
In a nutshell I found the gun which I currently own (Ruger SR9).
Like it says.
They help you choose a gun not sell you one.
Extremely friendly and family oriented.
You walk in and there is a coloring table for kids!
First gun store based around the safety of the FAMILY not person.
100% satisfaction from this customer!
