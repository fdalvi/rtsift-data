Great service.
Very smart and friendly staff.
The manager and his team are the real deal.

I would give them 3 stars because they have very helpful staff and try to answer all your issues.
The problem is that their supplies are not inexpensive and they often try to sell you stuff that surmounts to really just colored water, like water clarifier.
Just try to buy the basics when you go there and don't buy into the hype of all the different chemicals they will try to sell you.

First, this store has moved to a nearby location, SW corner of 44th and Thomas near Starbucks.
Service is excellent.
The employees are very knowledgeable and really seem to care about your specific pool issues.
I tend to trust their advice and follow it.
I never feel like they pushed "snake oil" on me.
One cool thing is that they keep a computer record of your pool and water information.
The only drawback is that sometimes the wait can be long to get service.
I think that's a byproduct of them providing good, personalized service to each customer so I'm not going to knock off a star for that.
They might consider hiring an additional *well trained* employee during the busy summer months.
There really aren't many other pool store options in Phoenix so they have a bit of a captive audience.
They could just rest on that fact and provide poor service but they don't.
I don't feel like I'm getting gouged by their prices either.
I don't enjoy spending money on pool chemicals though.
Again, I don't have a frame of reference since there aren't really any other major pool stores around.
I've been using this location (the old one and the new one) for years.
I'm satisfied and will continue to use them at this location.
