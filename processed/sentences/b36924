I haven't had a Family Doctor in a number of years.
Had I known about Dr Reed's practice then, that wouldn't have been the case.
Dr Reed's practice is clean and welcoming and his receptionist is kind and engaging.
Dr Reed himself is patient and listens thoroughly, while taking the time to understand and accommodate his patient's concerns.
I would highly recommend Dr Reed and his staff to anyone looking for a doctor.

I've had chronic back pain for three years now.
24/7.
Every day.
All day.
A Lot of pain.
I've been to two other doctors that gave me x-rays, gave me pills, told me to do some stretches and even went through physical therapy for a few months.
Nothing worked.
I was told to visit another doctor by a co-worker, but that doctor wasn't taking patients and he suggested that I try Dr. Reed.
So I did.
Actually.
My visit to Dr. Reed was because I was sick at the time, and I was only going to mention in passing my back pain to get some history going with him.
I was diagnosed with viral flu for my sickness which was as expected.
But in the same session Dr. Reed already found that one hip was higher than the other and made  a couple of adjustments and stretched me out.
I kid you not, for two days afterward, my pain in my back has been reduced by at least 80%.
I realize it's temporary for now as one session obviously isn't going to cure me.
But now I am at least optimistic, especially considering that I was afraid I had a degenerative disease.
Thank you Dr. Reed!

Without reservation, I give this doctor and his office staff five stars.
Jennifer is great.
She is kind, helpful, and reassuring.
Myrna, the medical assistant, is wonderful.
She is gentle and makes me feel at ease, which is not a common feeling for me in a doctor's office.
Dr. Reed has been patient with me, and takes the time to explain information to me in an understandable way.
Going for medical treatment became a much better experience since I found this office.

We are new to the Phoenix area and I went to Dr. Reed based on very positive internet reviews I found including Yelp.
I have to say I was extremely happy with my entire experience!
Jennifer who I spoke with over the phone was super nice and their excellent customer service continued in person when I was seen in the office just a few hours later (yes he saw me the same day!
) I was also very impressed that Jennifer made sure he saw me before the patient who arrived after me even though I was a new patient and needed to have my chart put together.
Dr. Reed was extremely friendly.
I never felt rushed and he was very thorough.
I also liked that he has been to medical school in the last decade and is up to date on the latest standards of care and treatment.
Overall, this was one of the most positive experiences I have ever had with a doctor.
In fact my whole family will now be going to see him.
One tip, because his practice is pretty new he is currently open on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays but as his practice grows he plans to add more days.
Also his office is nothing special, but it was clean and frankly I am most concerned about getting good care and excellent customer service!
You don't need all the extras when you have competent staff and are good at what you do.
As someone who works in the healthcare field and has been around a lot of doctors, I can confidently say he is a top notch doctor with a terrific bedside manner.
Highly recommended!!!!

Dr Reed is personable, patient, understanding and the type of person that you will want to take care of you, your kids, and your grandkids.
My wife and I have been patients for more than a year and are extremely happy.
He has treated us for all of the things that happen to you in life courteously, efficiently and has a bedside manner that we sought for after moving back to the Valley a few years ago and losing our family doctor of 20 years.
Dr. Reeds front office staff is very friendly and makes your paper trail process their focus to keep your time in the office brief and to the point.
