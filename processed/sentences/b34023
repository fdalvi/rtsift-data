Grub!
Gotta have it Grub for flight crews and airport employees only!
Our on private taco truck and more.
Good service until it gets busy.
Somehow, Monkey always gets order lost in the mix.
Otherwise, it's the best place to eat in the entire airport.
Good prices for good food.
Tacos, burgers, tostadas, sandwiches, breakfast burritos - absolutely filling and don't forget the ice cold drinks and treats.
Monkey usually do:  ASADA TACOS, CHICKEN TACOS, BREAKFAST BURRITOS...

Great food for a good price!
The deals here a really good.
The Las Vegas airport is expensive for almost all food.
The "Roach Coach" is the best deal around.
Honest fast friendly service and the food in its to go container is perfect to take on the airplane!

Big portions, great price.
Fresh cilantro.
I haven't had anything bad here.
I was somehow persuaded to try a "wet" burrito.
It looked really awful and was sloppy to eat (be sure to grab a spoon), but it was really delicious!
I'll definitely be getting this again.

I always get their Ck.tacos.
You get 3 tacos with rice and beans for about $7 bucks.
I hear everything else is pretty good as well.
I will have to try their Carne Asada tacos next time around.
