I am writing this for a friend who has had about 40 visits at this Hell office.
They cover workmen compensation cases.
My friend was injured on the job.
To the point that ruptured some disc's in his back.
Keeping him in constant pain.
This has been going on for about 10 years now.
Seven back surgeries.
He is a young guy, and it has ruined his life.
He can no longer do the sports that he once loved.
Dr. Lisa Stearns is the lead Doctor.
However, he never knows when she will actually see him,or if it will be one of the many changing PA's.
Every time he goes in ,there are new employees and his appts.
are rarely seen on time.
The last few times he has been in, he has had very unprofessional treatment.
As if he is nothing but, a number there.
He has just been given his 3rd surgery for his pain pump.
They even forgot to turn it on.
If you have to go here, give it a 2nd thought ,talk to others who have been here.

I cannot strongly enough NOT recommend these people.
I don't even know where to begin.
It is a toss up whether or not you will actually be able to keep your appointment because appointments are routinely "lost" in their computer system.
If you are lucky enough and they can verify your appointment and you get your name called be sure to clear the rest of your day because you will be waiting for hours in the exam room.
Do not expect to build a relationship with a specific PA or doctor because their revolving door swings so fast you'll make yourself dizzy.
Be sure to set up a fund for  yourself so that you can pay for the random drug tests they like to give on an almost monthly basis.
You will need this fund because the tests they give are so extensive they will run you into the hundreds of dollars.
(This is WITH insurance)  And finally, if you decide that you have had enough of their patronizing deprecation and decide to take your care elsewhere do not ask for a letter of discharge.
It will be nasty.
