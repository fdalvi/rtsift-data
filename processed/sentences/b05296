Dr. Brandt has helped my little one and our new little one for the last two years after I had some issues with another VET.
My dog has a cortisol condition, and she is 14 1/2 years old.
Without going into too much detail - she has a hard time standing on hind legs and has issues like anxiety, nervousness, body aches and joint issues.
Since working with Dr. Brandt, we have treated her holistically with herbs and to my amazement she has really made progress along with other treatments such as acupuncture and adjustments.
I highly recommend her - she is a woman who knows animals and a woman of integrity.

Dr. Nancy is amazing and truly cares about the animals in her care.
She has a very special relationship with all animals and I feel blessed to have found her.
She has helped all my dogs by treating them holistically.
Her staff is also kind and caring and can't be beat.
Many people find Dr. Nancy when other vets can no longer do anything for a pet, so they say, "try her.
" What people find is that Dr. Nancy's skill and knowledge of holistic modalities improves their pet's life.
My Jack Russell was always afraid of the vet and would shake and whine during the vet visit.
The first time we went to Dr. Nancy, she adjusted her spine and my JRT laid down on the floor and relaxed.
She loved going to see Dr. Nancy.
I know all my dogs are going to have a longer, healthier, life because of what she has taught me.
If you want someone who loves your pet, knows their stuff, and spoils her clients - then you want Dr. Nancy.

Dr Brandt and the while staff are amazing from the phone to the exam to check out.
Very easy to understand and they all care about your pets well being.
They took very good care of my girl and me.
I appreciate their knowledge and cleanliness
