Great staff !

Yes, I will be taking my kids here if I ever need to again.
In and out.
Not crazy busy.
Went @4am.
Caring, gentle, catering to my baby girl!
Also didn't have a clue who to take my kids to as far as a pediatrician and I appreciate your input and referrals.
Awesome team!
Thanks Bri and Dr Bartha :] you two are blessings in disguise!

Came in late at night because my 2.5 year old son was vomiting every 20-25 minutes.
The check in process is slow.
However, everything besides that was AWESOME!
Great nurse and amazing peditrician!!!
(I'd mention them by name, but I was a little pre-occupied cleaning up vomit)  They took excellent care of us, very personable bedside manner and my toddler really liked them.
