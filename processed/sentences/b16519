I seriously love this place.
It's a mom and pops business.
The owners are so nice and extremely helpful.

This place is near my house and works out perfectly for my ebay mail.
I just walk in, avoid the post office line, and I'm done.
Great!

Called on a Saturday evening and was rudely told that they only service hospitals, hotels, etc and don't have someone sitting around.
