Looking for a fast mexican food with all the traditional flavor this is the spot.
Me and my family have been going for over 7 yrs:)

I hate to give local businesses bad reviews, but this place is fuckin uuuup!
Gave this place's menudo a shot while experiencing the hangover from hell on a Sunday morning.
The restaurant has a beautiful menudo poster on the window.
Large pieces of honeycomb tripe, fresh lime, crushed red pepper and cilantro...To a Mexican with a hangover, there is no better sight!
So I walk inside and order a bowl, about $5, standard price.
I take a seat and a few moments later, I'm greeted with a  heaping bowl of hominy and a few shitty pieces of tripe.
The red chile was a deep, dark red and looked very old.
Shocked that my menudo looked absolutely nothing like it did on the poster outside, I dug around in my bowl, looking for some kind of hope that I would find a mere trace of what was advertised outside.
A few panicked spoonfuls of hominy later, I gave up and went next door to Fry's for a can of Juanita's menudo.

Decent Mexican takeout.
If I want a little more substance than fast food but don't quite have the time to head to a larger sit down place, I'll stop by for an order of 12 rolled tacos to split with my wife and/or a chorizo burrito.

Excelentes precios!!
Y la comida esta muy rica.
La limpieza es excelente y las personas que atienden son muy amables

Got the mexican flavor burger.
Was great, but all ingredients seemed store bought.
Other than that, another good burger.
