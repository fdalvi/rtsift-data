There are two Subways in Anthem.
Everybody told me the other one was better.
I went anyway and wow, what a shock.
After the first person put on 4 turkey slices and then 4 ham slices on the next person took 2 slices off of each one and told the first not to put on so much meat.
Sandwiches of the day don't get as much meat.
She did that right in front of me.
Not a very good value for the money.
The next day I went to the other Subway and they built a better sandwich.

The kids that work here are extremely unsanitary..
They are rude and just plain don't care.
To be honest I love subway but this store is gross.
The owner needs to fire the kids working here.
Lets be real, making a sub is not rocket science.
The other subway in town is 1000 times better.
I'm still pissed that the kids knowningly gave me really old bread that I only discovered when I got home.
I had to throw the subs in the trash.
I was afraid I would get sick.
Punk kids wasted $10 that I work hard for.
Never again will I go here.

This is my favorite subway in anthem.
I use to always go to to the one in daisy mtn  but I don't know what happened the kids there just got lazy there or something.
The manager there was very helpful and polite.
Will be taking my kids here from now on.

Poor service in the morning for breakfast.
Never again

Great Store and staff..  Love this store..
