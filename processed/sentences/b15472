Love this location and l love Nancy the gal that cuts my hair.
Nothing bad to say at all.
Plus with the check in app, it reduces your wait time.
And for $13 bucks a cut- you can't beat it!

"Name speaks for itself"  Friendly service.
Efficient.
Haven't had a bad cut yet.
Very family friendly.
Stylist are conversant, but not overly.
Check-in app is useful.
I've had my cut by 4 different stylist and I've been happy.
Nancy is probably the most popular stylist there.
She is the manager and her stylist like her.
Good management, good stylist, efficient, clean equals Great Clips (at least at this location).
