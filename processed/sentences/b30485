Horticultural Frontiers transformed my backyard from dreary to resort.
It was an incredible transformation to which I am very pleased.
Kent, the owner, has incredible vision.
They finished the project ahead of schedule for me at an incredible price.
I cant wait to use them again.

Sherry, Scottsdale  I am very satisfied with the results I received from Kent and his Company, Horticultural Frontiers.
They transformed my back yard from an ordinary yard to a beautiful landscaped yard.
Kent had wonderful ideas and surpassed all of my expectations.
