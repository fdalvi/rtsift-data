I've been with Dr. Vicuna for over a couple of years now.
She's definitely knowledgeable and friendly.
I haven't had many bad experiences with optometrists at all really, but the staff here are always welcoming with my entire family, so there's absolutely nothing I can complain about.
I highly recommend Dr. Vicuna to any local or tourist in need of an optometrist.

Dr. Vicuna is wonderful!
We have been going to her for about 3 years and she is wonderful with children.
She is soft spoken and answers any questions as well as follows up with an email if requested about the eye appoint for your child.
The staff is wonderful as well and makes an eye appointment for children enjoyable!
