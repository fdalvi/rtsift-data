Do not use this dental office, unless you want to be overcharged.
Their prices are higher than most dental offices in town.
Not only are their prices higher...they give their patients skewed approximations of what insurance will cover and what the patient will have to pay.
Also the office will try and upsell you left and right on many additional features that are unnecessary.
They also try and spread out the visits to receive more payments from insurance companies as well.
One day x-rays.
Next week cleaning.
Despite the higher prices, I had a couple of cavities taken care of at this office because the staff seemed nice and professional, and two weeks after my cavities were fixed, I received a call from the office staff telling me I owed over $600 in additional to the $400+ I had already paid.
Their estimate was approximately 70% off of what they had originally stated insurance would cover.
What BS.
I've heard of estimates being a little off, but not by over 70%.
If you are looking for a dentist, find another.
There are many high quality dentists in Scottsdale.
AVOID THIS OFFICE.

My entire family has used Dr. Beischel for years and my sons, ages 3 and 4, are now both patients.
The environment is friendly and professional -- and my kids actually look forward to the experience.
Highly recommend this practice.

Absolutely love this office and the dentists!
My Father worked for this office many many many years ago (he has since passed away) and I still use them to this day!
My whole family is very well taken care of by Dr. Beischel and Dr. Vander Schaaf.
The office is really beautiful and the whole staff is incredibly friendly.
Everyone really puts you at ease - I don't have fear going to the dentist.
Every time I have work done, it's always perfect and the work they did for my husband is absolutely amazing!
His smile is so perfect now!
One amazing instance was about a year ago when my Mom fell and fractured her jaw.
They were able to see her immediately for the emergency.
They really worked hard to keep her from needing surgery and they did such an amazing job that she didn't need surgery and did not even need root canals!
Her jaw healed beautifully and you would never know that it happened.
They were so helpful and were there when we needed them the most.
I recommend Dr. Beischel & Vander Schaaf to everyone I know!
If you are looking for talented and honest - these are your dentists!

This review is not for the dentist, but rather for the nasty receptionist.
Dr. Vander Schaaf was rather a sweet mid-aged lady and her hygienist was really sweet too.
But,... Heather or Betty?
its been like 8-9 months since I've been here I still remember how displeased I was by the experience with the receptionist I stopped going back after two visits.
She was so rude and disrespectful of my time, I was outraged and eventually found another dentist.
She was not helpful with scheduling my appointments around my work schedule to say the very least.
