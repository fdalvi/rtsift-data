I really can not explain the lack of customer service at this branch.
I had a lady banker push me for a checking/savings/credit card pretty hard.
Since I have a Mortgage with them the teller got a banker to come to the teller window, which I did not want to deal with.
Than after 30 mins of going over documents and her sales spell I agree to sign up and she would call me later today to let me know about the credit card because she was backed up and help another lady.
A day turns to a week turns to a month, I go to pay my mortgage again and she trys to sell me on a credit card, I was like,"Hello, you never called me about the last one you tried to sign me up for".
I do not have any other accounts their.
I do my banking now with Chase because they have a great Military discount for active and Vets.

I've always had good customer service here... but I'm making sure it happens if it is ever lacking.
I don't think this branch is much different than any other... or any other bank.
