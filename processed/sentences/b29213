As the owner of Lights Out Exterminating periodically we run across scenarios where insects and plants meet.
Heather, a real horticulturist,  at Earth Smart Design is an invaluable resource for us to meet our clients needs without harming their landscaping and plants.
It is a relief to have someone in your pocket who is as passionate about their business as we are to ours.

Heather's wonderful.
She designed my mother's yard and maintains it.
What a difference!
We invited her to create a landscape design of our front and backyard.
She was thoughtful and listened to all our ideas and concerns and came back with a beautiful and budget friendly design.
She is a wealth of botanical information.
We are so excited to get started in the spring with her.
If it goes as well as we anticipate then I'll probably be back to offer 5 stars!
