Located lower level in Arrowhead Mall, this location has a good assortment of eyewear, clothing, watches, and even shoes/sandals.
Friendly service and a few good deals to be had this time of year.
Will be back again for sure.

They're OK.
The selection is less than other Oakley stores I've gone to (in California).
The service, however, is just as disappointing.
Again, NO ONE even spoke to us- maybe its the company policy NOT to talk to the people that potentially could determine whether your store stays open or closed.
:/ Anyway, I saw the item I've been spying on for the past month or so....despite the crappy service, decided to just get it anyway- it was calling out to me.
Go to ring up:   1) if you don't like your job, goodness- you can't be making that much working PT- go find another damn job.
You obviously hate it there.
2) I'm buying apparel- why would you leave my jacket on the counter, give me my receipt then look blankly at me...."oh, did you want a bag?".
SERIOUSLY.
holy canoli.
3) Don't just throw my stuff in the bag- I was tempted to throw it back in her face and get a refund.
My friend with me couldn't hold in the laughter- it was pretty ridiculous.
Thanks, I'll order online next time.
At least that way, i won't have to ASK to have my stuff packaged- god forbid.

The guys here are very nice.
They seem to genuinely enjoy their job!
