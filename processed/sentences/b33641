These guys are short sale gods.
Totally saved me.
Thanks

Thank You Sovereign Realty for giving us the up to date information on the las vegas housing market.
The agents and staff are more than knowledgable and helpful.
Very highly recommended.

We've been so lucky to find Faith Harmer (a Sovereign Realty agent) as our realtor.
She helped us purchase our first home in 2012.
We got it for an amazing deal and never had a doubt about our purchase.
We'd never bought a home before and she not only explained every step thoroughly, she anticipated all our questions and made a complicated process seem so simple.
Then at the end of 2013, we sold that first home.
Even though we loved our home, we were moving for work.
Faith walked us through our first home sale, too.
Not only did she guide us through the process and keep all the paperwork we'd need, she sold our house in a DAY!
I was neverous about the market as she came and took pictures on a Monday, but by Tuesday night, we had a cash offer, at almost 150% of our purchase price just a year and half before our sale.
Can't beat that.
Faith has been such an amazing part of making our family at home, that she's not just a realtor, she's a friend.
Thanks for everything you've done for us, and I can't recommend her enough.
