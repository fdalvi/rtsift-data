Great little vacuum store on the east side - they'll try to sell you a Riccar vacuum, which is kinda pricey, but believe me, they're right.
Best vacuum I've ever used.
Forget Dyson.
Oh, and they'll demo the vacuums for you and explain everything.
Really nice guys and worth checking out if you're in the market for a vacuum that's not a piece of junk.

I bought a new Dyson DC-50 vacuum.
I found it 10 days for $120 less at another shop in Madison so I called to ask if they would do anything to help me out.
I was out of the 7 day return/exchange window, and spoke to a guy at the Odana Rd.
location and he told me I had to call the owner of the store.
I called the owner and left 4 messages over a 2 week span and never received a call back.
I would never do business with this company again.
Overall, a very disappointing experience.

My vacuum cleaner stopped working on New Year's Eve.
I called late and they were open.
I planned on just dropping it off.
When I got there, they looked it over - took it in the back, cleaned out the problem and then carried it out to my car - all with a big smile.
I always have excellent service at Olsons.
I own a Kirby and they are always helpful with the care and maintenance.
I highly recommend Olsons!!
When I am ready for my next vacuum cleaner, I will buy from them.
