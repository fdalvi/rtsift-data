I noticed this new shop on yelp and decided to call up and find out what they where all about.... And the person that answered the call was especially helpful!....
So I drove all the way from Anthem in Henderson to check them out....
They have a really cool look it's new, nice flooring and a sweet counter too, really nice custom seats at the bar, and a nice lounge and big flat panels on the wall!...
I tried a few juices got a good deal swapped some vape story's and found a great new spot to hang out...   Go check them out it's totally worth the trip:)

#1 for Vegas and my vapor needs in my opinion.
Stopped by for the first time from Los Angeles and had a great selection for just being open for a week!
Came back with a magnet upgrade for my nemesis.
Nirvana juice and a build that plumes!
Thanks plume factory, I'll be back next time I'm in town.

Awesome atmosphere!
Great people!
Good pricing!
