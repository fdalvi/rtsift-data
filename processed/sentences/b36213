I thought I had been to the slowest Starbucks ever.
This one is slower.
You know what I want to do in Las Vegas?
Sit in Starbucks for half an hour waiting for a frappuccino.
Luckily, it only took 3 times to get them to put espresso in the drink.

I don't understand why this Starbucks has such bad reviews!
I stayed at The Signature at MGM Grand in tower 3 for 5 days and visited this Starbucks for 3 of those 5 days and had 0 problems.
Each time I went in there, no one else was in there and my drinks were made very promptly.
The staff was friendly and my drink tasted very good.

Conveniently placed but their lines are crazy long and their items are over priced.
A plain croissant costs more than my coffee.
They do, however offer free hot water which is great!

on day 4 of our trip I finally realized this Starbucks is here at the MGM  - dang!
could have been enjoying my usual beverage everyday/ Oh, well, found it now.
Located in Tower 1 - this Starbucks doesn't have any lines to speak of compared to the one in the MGM food court area.
I ordered a Venti Vanilla Macchiato with No Foam.
It was great.
The Baristas were very nice and I had no problem using my Starbucks phone app to pay for my drinks.
It's not a cheap Starbucks.
You're paying for convenience, don't like it, stand in line for an hour in the MGM Starbucks.
