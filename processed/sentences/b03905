What a gem!
Hidden in an industrial area of Tempe I sought out this place for some local Raw honey.
A lot of stores either carry Crockett's regular honey, or Raw honey from Canada or Vermont or somewhere, but I wanted the best of both worlds!
As soon as you walk in the ridiculous smell of sweet honey hits you in the face!
It's awesome!
Their skilled and well educated staff will lead you to the perfect honey choice for you.
They also have some other bee related products like wax and pollen.
All your local honey needs right down the street, who knew?
Plus the honey is delicious, so glad I made the trip.

Get honey duh.and its all local

Crockett's raw honey is now available at Costco for $8.99 for 3 lb (about a quart!
) Yay!

The best honey I've ever tasted
