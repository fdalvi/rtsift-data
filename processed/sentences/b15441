I stopped by my local hi-health store today to pick up a few things...
I like this location better than some of the others I've been to.
The employees are friendly but leave you alone to wonder if you please, and the store itself is clean and well layed out.
I found what I needed in no time (Diet Turbo Tea specifically) and also picked up some things I didn't need (a couple of protein bars, protein pudding, and some natural and organic body lotion).
I do think that Hi-Health's pricing is a bit high... but I guess if I were to try to find another health food store with better pricing, I'd be paying the difference with time and gas prices, so I'll stick to HH for now!

Excellent selection, usually has everything I need.
Helpful staff.

the store was clean and easily accessible.
spencer the associate was helpful and answered all my questions.
i'll be returning soon.
