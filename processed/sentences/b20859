I never thought I would review a place and award it 1 star, but Fresh Choice deserves it.
I went into this local food store last year to buy some fruit as their selection of fruit and veg outside their store looked tempting and mouth watering.
How wrong I was.
I bought blueberries and Granny Smith apples, and although they were both well priced, they were off and rotten inside when I ate them - such a waste of money.
It was only recently that I discovered that Fresh Choice had been fined Â£300 in January 2009 for selling food that was past its use by date.
If you do go to this shop check the sell by date on thier fresh produce or perhaps stick to their dried and canned foods which can't really go off.
Perhaps not a Fresh Choice after all.

This is a shop I have a great amount of familiarity with because I used to pass it every day.
It's not a cheap fruit and veg store, but the food is generally of high quality and I've certainly never had anything gone off from here.
From here over time I have got some decent deals, but if you just want the cheapest goods, you may be best off going elsewhere because if you pick the right foods at the right time of year you can't beat here for quality.

The weird thing is, when I used to live in Halls and pass this every day on my way to uni I never noticed how good it was.
Imagine the kind of fruit stall you'd find in a market, keep those prices and then blend it with a very well-stocked corner shop, and that's more or less what this shop is like.
Whether you're after a pint of milk, a punnet of perfectly ripe black cherries or some exotic imported mangoes that are so juicy you have to eat them outside, this is your place.
Although they might charge a bit more than other nearby shops which claim to sell fresh fruit and veg at a fraction of the price, I've never bought anything from here only to get home and find that the underneath layer is all mouldy (unlike places like Kamco).
