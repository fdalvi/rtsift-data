We had been fostering a dog who was very nervous to be in a new house.
Imagine what comes with an 85 pound nervous dog...  Dustin made our carpets look like new!
No lie!
They went from filthy (we're talking replacement worthy) to good as new.
He's also done tile and couch cleaning for some friends who raved about having new tile when he was done!

Best work we have had done.
I usually wait too long in between carpet cleaning, but Dustin always make them look great and for less than we have charged by some of the bigger companies.

As someone who has previously worked in the carpet cleaning industry, I can assure you that Hurst Carpet and Tile Care knows what they're doing.
They arrived right on schedule and were able to clean all of my 2 story home in a short time period.
First time this carpet have been cleaned after 3 years of use and they look brand new.
Of course, there were some pets stains that wouldn't come out, but that's on me for not catching them when they happened.
Hurst is very reasonably priced.
I have a neighbor that recently had two rooms cleaned for the about the same price as my entire home (2 dens, 2 rooms, master bedroom, stairs & hallway).
Give these guys a shot, you won't be disappointed.
Support local businesses!

Dustin is the carpet man!
He did a wonderful job & at an affordable price.
Very professional & courteous.
