Recieved a door hanger with a 20% discount.
Went to the restuarant on Christmas eve and found it closed.
As this was a holiday eve I let it go.
Tried the following MOnday....Closed!
Tried Jan 6 2012 and Closed!
Every time I went to this place, it was closed.....Will not try again!!!!!!!

= = = = = = CLOSED = = = = = =  It doesn't matter how it was because this place came & went all in the month of January!
Apparently they didn't have a nickel's worth of start-up capital!
:-O

Too bad they didn't make it.
Went on new years eve, but there were only a few people and loads of food out.
It  almost seems like  a cursed  location, as so many business come and go.
When they opened, they started to tear that part of town and country down and so it was a construction road that lead to their business, which might have sewm to many as in accesible.
The service was good, so was the food.
I wanted to go back to find them closed.
Feel sorry for them.
