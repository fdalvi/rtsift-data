Brown: The Stationers is a great little stationery shop next to Surgeon's Hall in Newington.
Whilst it will no doubt receive competition from the Rymans that has opened just down the road, I think it should hold its own with the wide range of services it offers.
Back when I first visited this shop, it was just a stationers, selling the normal range of stationery and office equipment.
They have since branched out into providing food and coffee, as well as computers with an internet connection plus WiFi.
So, it now combines the idea of Starbucks with Rymans to provide the facilities of both!
It's unique in this sense, so far as I can tell.
Back when it was a pure stationery shop, it was never lacking in reasonably priced stationery, and I expect this to have continued.
It remains to be seen as to whether they are trying to do a bit too much in the one place.
Give them a go, and see how successful or not they are.
