A friend rented this storage unit for me initially as I was leaving the state.
When it came time to switch the unit into my name, it was quite the odyssey or comedy of errors.
After several calls to management, a trip to the facility by my friend to switch the unit over, followed up by a written agreement that management supplied for us both to sign, noting the change, my friend still kept getting calls and emails about payment for the unit.
It took several months to get this straightened out.
Communication between whoever was answering the phone and manning the desk (over a year ago) and actual input into the computer to note the change, was inaccurate and caused a lot of grief.
However, it did finally get straightened out and for the past several months, it has been smooth sailing.
I find the people that I am dealing with now very professional and friendly and willing to work with me.
So, for current experience, I believe this is a good place to store your belongings.

This place and space is well organized, clean and safe.
I been using this storage center for years.
No complaints....

I would suggest you only use this place for max 6-7 months.
Its nice to have air-conditioned units, but they raise their prices too often and it doesn't matter if you stay for a longer time.
I am going to have to find a new place as this place is getting more expensive.
Im curious at what point enough is enough?
