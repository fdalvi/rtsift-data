I've been coming to this location to this location ever since 2002.
The staff changes frequently but the beds and the service remains the same, always clean and in good working condition.
You always wonder to yourself after you get undressed and lay down, I wonder if one of the bulbs will be burnt out..... Never happened to me here yet :)

Great customer service, best prices in town and always the best results whenever i go in!
I recommend bodyheat to all my friends, family and co workers!
By far the best tanning salon in vegas!

Great selection on tanning beds.
The way they have their packages set up makes everything complicated.

Groupon spray tans!
Versaspa is the best spray tanning system in my opinion, and when you get 2 for $25 from groupon, my pasty freckled covered body can't resist it!
The service is friendly and the place is clean.
They have a monthly membership option too.

Everyone here is so professional and nice.
Great place to tan and I'll definitely be coming back.
Came in not knowing much other than sunlight=tan skin.
Elizabeth was great, explained how everything worked, and made sure I got exactly what I was looking for.
I'd ask for her if I were you!
