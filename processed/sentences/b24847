.39 tacos daily is hard to beat

Come here quite often.
Customer service is usually good as well as order accuracy and speed.
Restaurant is clean.

Your typical del taco... Cheap food.
Fast service.
Clean tables.
I love that they serve cherry coke at Del Taco.
Goes perfect with the cheese quesadilla (no green sauce) and some fries.
The parking lot here is a bit of a nightmare.
Came on a Saturday and the drive thru was clogging up everything.
Once inside it was pretty quick though.

The dining area does not stay open as posted on their business.
The guy at the drive through gave us attitude when we asked about the dining hours.
On top of that, our order was wrong.

Went for tacos after the movie around 9:00 p.m.  Sign said they were open until 11:00 p.m.
But chairs at several tables were already stacked.
Service was less than stellar.
No one in the place but still had to wait.
Food was fast and good!
Went back to order those delicious little caramel bites and waited....and waited while manager talked on his cell phone.
Finally made a comment regarding his being on the phone and too busy to wait on customers.
Then the guy who was taking drive thru orders finally took the order but with an attitude.
Another couple who came in after us received the same attitude.
We probably won't return to this Del Taco!
