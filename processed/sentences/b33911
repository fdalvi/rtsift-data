Stopped by here with some girlfriends when out shopping at Arizona Mills.
Noticed they also have a kiosk in the mall but we went to the actual store.
For $10 my girlfriend got her eyebrows threaded.
In 5 minutes she was transformed!
Beautiful, quick, and cheap.
Would definitely recommend!

The first time I went here, I had a good experience.
But when I went recently, I had a bad experience, by eyebrow's was not done well, it looked bad.
The manager just left some inexperienced person to do, without monitoring.
If you want to get more business, please try to provide good service to all of your customers.

I was scared to go to a kiosk of all places to get my eyebrows and lip done.
But when she handed me the mirror afterwards.
My eyebrows were amazing!!!!
I was so happy with her work.
And it didn't even hurt!
I regret the fact I didn't ask for her name.
But whenever you you want amazing eyebrows and you're in the area.
Give it a try!
