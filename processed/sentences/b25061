These guys are awesome and the gurus of big block Buick performance.
Very helpful and kind and will always take the time to make sure you are buying the correct products for your performance application.
They even helped me in making a decision on the correct carburetor for my application when they did'nt even sell this brand and did'nt try to talk me into one of the brands that they sell instead.
Can't say enough good things about them, always a pleasure to deal with.
Been buying performance Buick parts from them for the better part of ten years.

The owner operator Tom himself answered my email .
Not many companies will do that.
Move over Kenne, Jim Bell, well you actually already have.
Their is a new king of Buick around.
