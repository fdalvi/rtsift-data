Okello will have you taking great photo's in one workshop.
highly recommend for those aspiring photographers.

Best class ever!
I love Okello's teaching style: fun, hands on, good use of powerpoint, and sarcasm!!!
:) I enjoyed Part 1 & 2.
Ready for Light Room 4 next!
Highly recommended.

This is the second photo class I've been to--the first one was more of a photoshoot (with models and was taught by a local photographer), so very little time was spent on the camera settings, etc.
This class was perfect!
I'm just sorry I didn't sign up for part II and the Lightroom course.
I thought the visual part of the class was perfect--Okello took photos at different settings and shared the results with the class immediately.
You can tell that he truly loves what he does and is eager to share all that he knows with other budding photogs.
Hope you come back to Phoenix next year, Okello!
The only complaint (if you can call it that) was that it was difficult to hear at times--my fault, I should have said something.
