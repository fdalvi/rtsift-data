The best!
Dr. Walker is by far the most gentle dentist I have visited.
Not only is she great with adult patients, but she was so great with my 4 year old daughter.
She makes visiting the dentist a very good experience.

I was referred to Stephanie Walker through a friend.
I cannot say enough about this dentist.
The whole staff is very kind, compassionate and professional at the same time.
I felt comfortable with them the moment I walked into the front door.
It is decorated beautifully in the office.. even the bathroom.
Very clean and organized with up-to-date technology.
Dr Walker has such a caring touch and is very good at what she does.
I have always been one to HATE going to the dentist, but have now referred her many of my family and friends.
Quite a few of my reluctant family members have already been to see her and used her services.
I highly recommend Dr Walker and her staff to one and all!

I love Dr. Walker, she is awesome and she as a nice staff, but what i just cant deal with is their $50 appointment change fee.
48 hours is a lot of advanced notice for people who ALSO have important careers and schedule changes.
I know her time is important but to charge an existing customer you are allready making a mint off of for me and three family members all with dental insurance... thats just not right.
