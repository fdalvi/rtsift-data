AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING if I could find better words to describe this place I would.
I just moved to Vegas about a year ago and could never find a great quality cleaners with great prices, that is until someone told me about Mr. Cleaners I take all my clothes there and never have had a single problem.
Customer service is fantastic you can actually understand their English and they are very sweet people to talk with.
Also I don't understand or could even believe a word that last review said I take my most expensive clothes some include my Herve Ledger ($1000-3000 a piece) there and it comes out 100% perfect.
I definitely recommend going there.
Only thing is it's prepaid or it goes from 2.50 prepaid or 3.00 pay later.

You can't beat these prices!
2.50 for one piece?!?!
The staff is so nice and really cares about customer satisfaction!
I am always greeted with a big hello and warm smiles.
My clothes always come out looking great.
All my clothes, expensive or not come out looking AMAZING!
I've recommended all my friends to this place!!
The place is clean and tidy and family friendly!

I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!
The front lady thats there until 3 is so funny and sweet!
You don't find great customer service like that!
The prices are amazing and you get your clothes the NEXT DAY.
Cleaning is great and the shop is tidy!
More cleaners need to take tips from this place!
Feels like home (;
