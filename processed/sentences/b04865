I know it was like 4 in the morning, but this place had a slow response time over drive-thru speaker - including unexplained pauses - and ran out of rice for my friend's chicken teriyaki bowl.
This means that I'm going to pick a different local Jack in the Box to hit up late at night, such as the one on Mountain Vista and Russell.
That place totally did have rice when I drove over there, and it was way faster.

Croissant was yummy!
