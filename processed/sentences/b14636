I've been cutting my hair here for more than a year already every two weeks.
I was a bit skeptical about going here to get a fade but ended up with a pretty good hair cut for cheap.
My usual haircut is a 3 at the top and 0 on the sides with a medium high fade.
Two barbers I highly suggest you go to that does an awesome job is Maria and Malorie.
If you end up going to this place a lot or any other Great Clips, Take advantage of the current special which is buying pre-paid haircuts for $9.99.
They recently raised their regular hair cuts from $12 to $13 not too long ago.

I have been there twice; once with my husband and just today.
The first time the cut wasn't bad, just not quite as short as I wanted.
My husband's cut was choppy and it took over a month before it looked decent and didn't stand up.
Today, I unfortunately got the same hairdresser as my husband had and she failed to listen to my requests.
Apparently, she likes longer hair and prettier styles on women because she suggested I use pomade and fluff up the back.
I just wanted a simple pixie cut that I could wash and go, and a little thinning as I have thick hair.
I had to come home and even it out on top and even by the end of the cut and several suggestions from me she just didn't get it... even when I offered celebrities with similar cuts.
She was also clumsy and very judgmental in her demeanor.
I will not be back and neither will my husband.

Always great service and great hair cuts, my son and husband both got there haircuts here a few days ago and the lady did great.
Only place I go for my haircuts as well,  that is reasonable considering salons are expensive
