This company strung us along for almost two months waiting for a sign to be made and installed .
finally with no call we called them only to be told that they couldn't make the sign they agreed to build.
we are a small local company since 1945 and feel totally ripped off by this company !

Best Thing I have done for my business.....was working with Citrus Signs and letting them design my banner and business cards.
I strongly recommend this company for anyones advertising needs!
Money well spent!

The price is good and i liked working with gerald on the design team, but that's about it.
Project management was a mess.
They submitted a design to city for approval on a design that i had rejected, causing confusion, backtracking and delays to my project.
Also, good luck getting the sales guys or the owner to return your calls after payment has been made.
I had placed 4 or 5 calls to ask about maintenance of my sign.
I feel like i'm simply not a priority - 6 months after i placed my last call to them and i have yet to hear back from them.
Use them if you want to save money and don't mind managing the project yourself to the minute details, and have your own contractor who can maintain your sign if it is defective.
I'm giving them one extra star for price and for Gerald.

Absolutely terrible.
The owner thinks he's so much better than everyone.
Never returns phone calls meaning he doesn't think the customer is important.
The funny thing is his workers know he's horrible as well.
