Visited Wisconsin Vision for an eye exam and to order corrective lenses...very professional service, Saturday appts available...placed an order for lenses and frames with the optical center, but had to cancel after I received a message that they had quoted incorrectly and the price would be much higher and would take up to 6-8 weeks.
Good selection of frames, including some designer frames.

After a very bad experience at Stanton Optical, it was a breath of fresh air to be greeted by Susan at Wisconsin Vision.
She helped me pick out my frames and helped me save 100$  on my frames at the register.
It was very affordable and enjoyable.
I will return there for my next pair.

Wonderful.
My girlfriend had to pick up her new glasses from them and they were really great.
They greeted us as soon as we walked in and were very polite.
The woman behind the counter was helpful and made sure the glasses fit exactly right.
She even complimented my girlfriend on her selection which really made me smile.
All in all, great experience.
