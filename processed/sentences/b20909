This is a proper fish shop that even has water cascading down the window.
There is usually a queue out the door that's how great this fish shop is.
They don't stock a great amount of unusual fish, but you can get tuna and swordfish on a regular basis.
They sell the biggest eggs.
The eggs are such great value and are nearly always double yolks.
The staff are always up for a bit of cheeky banter.
As this is a proper fish shop, it's always closed on a Monday.

Located in the heart of Portobello High Street, Williamson's screams local flavour.
Right down to the knowledgeable and personable gentlemen that tend the counter; they have a conversation for everyone.
My experience of fishmongers isn't extensive to say the least, but on the occasional glance the stock seems to be quite samey with not a lot of variety.
That said I don't really know what unusual sea-dwellers I would be looking for.
The basics are all covered and there is a small range of squid, octopus, scallops and the like.
Prices seems reasonable.
My particular favourite being the herrings in dill sauce that come at a little over Â£2 for a tub.
Lovely.
