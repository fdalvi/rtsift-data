Oh Quizno's you are a damn shame.
A damn dirty shame.
Thinking, oh my they might have something I can eat, I promptly waited in line.
I ordered a regular and told you how much I would not like olives on my sandwich.
I also told you how I like light vinaigrette on it as well.
But no, you did not listen.
You gave me a wet, warm and crappy looking sandwich with traces of olives.
Fracking AWESOME!
Thank you so much for charging me 8 bucks for this horrendous meal.
I stuffed it down as I had to run, but I should have thrown it back and asked for my money back.
Ah well.

I purchased an $8 Groupon good for $16 for this Quiznos.
You'd think it should be pretty simple for someone of High School graduate age to ring up an order, subtract $16 and then give me the correct total, right?
WRONG!!!!!
They took off $7.36 pre-tax and then $8 post-tax.
The entire $16 should have been subtracted PRE-TAX like a coupon (in fact, like their combo discount).
But no!
Their method gyps the Groupon user out of an additional $1.34 on a $16 Groupon, on top of their outrageous prices because they're located in a strip casino food court.
STAY AWAY!!!

Good sandwich shop, friendly employee, odd location.
Would do again, great thing us all subs are the same price.

If I can give this place 0 stars, I would!
Also, if I was a health inspector, I would definitely shut this restaurant down.
After I already paid, I noticed that there were packages of beef sitting in a bin on the floor.
Another set of packages were on a cart next to bottles of Clorox Bleach.
This is not the way to thaw meat!
The cashier also was eating behind the counter!
I will definitely reach out to Quiznos and let them know that these people who lack knowledge of food safety can potentially harm customers with a foodborne illness!
