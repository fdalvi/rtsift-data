I have attended the Pain Institute of Nevada for a year now and couldn't be more happier for the quality of care that I receive.
The staff are very friendly and attentive to the patients and really want the best for them.

Best docs ever!
Doc K is a leading expert in Pain Management and is fantastic!
Doc Jarrett makes my back feel like a million bucks!!
Doc K's schedule gets full pretty quick so make sure you get on the books for an appointment.
Unfortunately his day doesn't have much "wiggle room".

Dr Kidwell and his professional staff are excellent.
They are friendly and well organized.
They really show that they care about your health.
