First of all, you guys need to refer to the one and only pic of the lady doing a mamo.
Freakin hilarious!
My situation was an x-ray follow up for kidney stones that had to be removed because it was lodged in my kidney.
I showed up at 7 am as a walk in expecting the worst because an appointment by it self usually takes time.
I was pleasantly surprised when they called me up at 7:45.
Now what happens next was not a pleasant surprise.
More of a wait, what?
I was told I had to get fully naked and put on a hospital gown.
They said it was ok for me to keep my socks on.
Another head scratcher.
Imagine going to a toga party.......commando style!
So I lie down and get my x-ray done.
The x-ray chick was kind of hot so as a guy I couldn't help but think of an x-ray toga party with a happy ending.
Anyways, it was over before the thought could even be put into motion in my head.
I was out by 8:15.
Awesome!
Update: The one pic I was referring to has been removed.
Why, I don't know.
Thought it was hilarious.

I came here for a CT scan with contrast.
I have had this test done twice before but not at this practice.
Overall they did an excellent job.
They were ontime with my appointment time, made sure that my labs were ok so that the dye did not mess me up internally, and the test itself was good.
I have done the test before where I felt like I was going to ralph.
This time I had no problem.
The techninitions were friendly and made me feel comfortable.

I come here many times since 2011, has friendly staff and very clean facility.
Plus, you can choose what radio station you can listen to on the headphones during MRI service.
