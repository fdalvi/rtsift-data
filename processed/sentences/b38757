Great place to grab a quick bite!
Tastes just like you bought it on the streets of NYC!
Cheap, fast, and delicious!

Good cheap eats!
Fast Service !Love the Lime a Rita's !!!

If you enjoy microscopic mediocre hot dogs, then this place is for you.
Costco's hot dogs are better and sell some called "Caspers," that will rock your world.
I'm shocked this place is still in business with the crappy product they are selling.
A normal sized bun with an anorexic hot dog in the middle.
Save your money and go anywhere else.

Working on Las Vegas Boulevard for almost 7 years and from New York City, this is by far the best hot dog in Las Vegas.
very reasonably priced, even for a place NOT on the strip(very inexpensive) service is outstanding, always fast and  accurate.A,lways clean, and a great place to people watch.
The entire staff is really friendly.
Oh by the way  they have a special there called the Royal Flush witch comes with 2 hot dogs, 20 oz  beverage and a huge pretzel, DON'T be afraid to ask them to make you a FRESH AND HOT PRETZEL

Bratwurst was the best I ever had.
Fast, tasty, clean and CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP.
Cant believe their prices ON THE STRIP.

$2.50 for a NY dog with sauerkraut and brown mustard.
There's really nothing more I can type about this place.
We've all had a hot dog, you know what you're getting every single time.
Plus, if you're stopping in here you've likely been drinking and need cheap, quick food.
This is a good idea.

If you're looking for a quick bite to eat at a cheap price, sure, go ahead.
Otherwise, you'd be better off going to Earl of Sandwich.
$7 for a bratwurst and it really didn't taste like much at all.

They deliver almost as promised.
I got two hot dogs, a pretzel, and a regular soda for $8 plus tax.
My only issues were that the hot dogs were smaller than expected and there were no refills on the soda.
The hotdogs and pretzel (and mustard) were delicious.
Overall, for the price on the strip it was filling and tasty.
