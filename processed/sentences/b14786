worst pizza I have ever had.
Wasn't even cut properly.
Little Caesars is a 5 star restaurant compared to this place.
The 2 liter sodas are 2$, that's the best I can offer.
It's cheap, but you can get better for about the same.
It's purposely designed to be cheap and catered to lower income families.
It's crap.
Doesn't deserve  a star.

I think the little kwik-e-mart pizzas taste a bit better than these.
I had both peperoni and just cheese and both were somehow both drippy with grease and really really really hard to bite through.

When this place opened several years ago, it was decent for chain pizza.
I picked up a pepperoni pizza earlier this year.
They've clearly slipped.
The pizza was greasy and orange, without a crisp crust.
The ingredients were low-end; all I could taste was oil.
Pizza Patron doesn't deliver and has no seating.
It is takeout only and I think it may only take cash (although they do take both US and Mexican currency -- I kid you not).
It is cheap, around $5-6 for a single topping.
They have some pizzas always ready, in case you can't wait.

Horrible pizza place!!!
Pizza is gross and the service is equally as bad.
I called for a large pizza and was told it was $4.99.
I asked for half pepperoni and half bacon.
When I went to pick up my order they charged me an extra $2.50 for splitting the toppings.
Would have been nice if they told me that when I called to place the order, especially when I specifically asked for the price.
I asked to change my order since I wasn't warned about the extra price and I was told NO.
Never going back!!

$3.99 for a large pizza, great deal!
Not a lot of chesse or sauce but is still good.
Location is a little far from me but I just toast a few slices in the toaster oven to heat up when I get home.
The toaster oven makes the crust a little crispy and it is great!
