I found my way to this office when I took advantage of a Groupon offer for a deep cleaning.
I've been back three times since so I can speak from at least some experience.
No, Dr. Turner is not the most outgoing dentist I've ever had but neither is he rude or short.
Kind of a strictly-business guy, and I guess that's not all bad.
As for me, however, I've decided to find another dentist in Mesa where I feel like my business is at least valued.
I'm sure Turner's a capable dentist, but visiting his office always leaves me cold.

I went in to see Dr. Turner this past month for my routine exam and had another great experience.
The front office staff was very friendly and was great about calling me when my appointment was due.
His hygienist is awesome and I enjoyed visiting with her while she cleaned my teeth.
I have been a patient of Dr. Turner for over 18 years now, and I go in every 6 months for my routine cleaning and have had a few root canals and crowns done by him over the years.
For a few years I didn't have insurance and needed a crown.
He went over my options and was willing to work with me to make sure I had the best options available.
He does quality work and I wouldn't go anyplace else.
