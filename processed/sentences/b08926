Excellent service cute clothes and kids trinkets and toys.
The real reason this place ranked is that my kids were goofing off in there and the clerk/possible owner, a kind lady with a magnificent British accent who hails from Nottingham said they were very well behaved.
When we left after buying a couple of small toys, she told both of my crumb crunchers to take another small toy they had been playing with and would not accept any money for the toys.

My assistant and I stop into Rascals once a week to look at clothes for our family and friends who have young children.
They are right next to Starbucks, so it is always a treat after picking up a cup of our favorite brew.
Rascals has an excellent selection that borders on the creative.
I have always been impressed by the above average quality of the material used in their kids clothes.
They do a nice job!

Cute little kids clothing shop next door to my salon.
A little on the pricy side, but I don't expect less in that area.
Bought Baby C the following -  a pair of sunglasses...$ 6   a Curious George stuffed toy...$ 20 and the best purchase...although very expensive in J's opinion...  handmade doggy hooded towel...$ 45  Now I know what you're thinking...I'm crazy for spending $ 45 on a towel.
Why not get 3 packs of hooded towels you can get from target or babies r us at that price.
Well let me tell you, we have those target and babies r us towels.
They are flimsy, suck at absorbing, and Baby C always got chilled.
This towel I purchased was top quality and an adult size bath towel.
Baby C loves it and I can get him immediately warm from his bath.
:)  Good purchase and a great store!
