Came down to the studios for an interview that may or may not have aired this week.
Pretty easy to find and the facilities seemed nice.
Wait, am I really reviewing a TV studio?
What the hell do I know about that?

I am basing my review only on the morning news...
In the morning, you will hear the traffic report and basic weather info once every 10 minutes... on the 8s.
That makes this the best news to listen to and/or watch in the mornings if you actually need to venture out of your house for work or anything else...
I am a fan of keeping things simple, and that's what Channel 8 morning news does.

Unable to get their over the air signal.
So why is the FCC allowing them the frequency?
I am in process of ditching the Dish and it would be awesome if this stupid channel came in the old fashioned way.
I bet their advertisers assume  people are getting their old signal.
paying dearly for it I bet.
Hope they read this review.

i have started watching a short while ago-and enjoy the channel - much beter in am since change of anchors - and the evening news is good too.
and i have no problem getting them on dish on channel 8 -
