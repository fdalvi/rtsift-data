I always have a great time when I go to Xclusive Ultra Lounge.
Their bottle prices are the best in town and they give you the *true* VIP experience: you can book one of their private rooms to enjoy drinking with your friends.
This unique feature is one that you just don't see at any of the other clubs in town and, for people like me who like their privacy, makes the whole experience SOOO much better.
If you DO want to go on the dance floor, there are always cool events going on like Three Six Mafia and Too Short, but their VIP rooms are still my favorite.

I enjoy going to Xclusive for a lot of reasons; even though they might specialize in "exclusive" VIP experiences, the part that I really love about it is that it is a nightlife home for Las Vegas locals.
Even though it is busy, the line is always manageable and the service is always friendly, making it a refreshing change from The Strip.
For the most part, locals have to pick between the hectic and often rude clubs on The Strip or local gaming pubs, without much in the middle.
Xclusive is perfect for going to relax, but still seeing people looking their best and there to party and dance, rather than silently drink at a slot machine.
The theme parties like the "All White Party" are the best, but they always have something fun going on.
Fridays and Saturdays have the best party atmosphere--and their Sunday industry nights have recently gotten to be a big hit with locals, but you can still go and have a good time on the weeknights with karaoke night and other themes.

There is not another place I'd rather party in Vegas than Xclusive.
The atmosphere is fun and relaxed, the food is awesome and the prices for the drinks are the lowest I've come across in a while.
What's even better than that is NO COVER!
When I travel from San Diego I already know where my clubbing time will be spent, Xclusive is the spot to see and be seen.
