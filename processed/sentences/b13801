So the first time I go in here ever.
It looks nice and clean but looked pretty abandoned inside.
Well stocked shelves.
I picked up an add and saw a bunch of their makeup was buy one get one free.
SCORE!!
Especially when the good stuff is $8-$12 at least.
So I'm roaming this place for the best deals and finally made my decisions.
I went to check out and the High School clerk behind the counter said my total was $38 something.
I was like WTF!?!?!?!
I was running late to pick up my girl from school so I grunted and paid and went on my way.
Well as I knew it when I went home to review my receipt I only got one of the specials.
So now I'm pissed because I'm going to have to waste more gas and energy to go back there and correct the situation which I can not stand having to tell people how to do their jobs.
When I went back there was like 10 people waiting in line to check out at this point my courtesy was being tested.
I waited patiently with my 6 yr old in tow asking for this and that gummy thing candy spinner the whole time.
I get to a cashier and end up returning all this was truly a P.I.T.A.
Next time I will just take CVS add to Walgreen's and see what they can do for me you dont even need a frequent buyer card there either.
Booooo CVS I boo you very much!!!

I have been to this CVS like a million times, it's literally a 30 sec drive from mi casa.
I think most of the cashiers know me & my hubby since we go here so much, for anything & everything from Captain Morgan/Sailor Jerry's for him to yummy scented body wash for me.
I like how they have coupons at the end of each receipt & the occasional extra bucks-woohoo!
They are affiliated with J C Penney, so I use my Penney's card here 90% of the time & the other 10 is actually at J C Penney.

Needs more of a selection.
Friendly staff

By far the worst pharmacy I've ever used.
Never have prescriptions when they promise.
I spend at least 30 minutes each time I come here waiting.
This it's time to move my prescriptions to Walmart

Worst pharmacy ever!!!!!!!!!
I have thought they would improve but was wrong.
They mislabel prescriptions, and are incompetent .
Go elsewhere .

Wonderful customer service.
I had an issue at another cvs with their photo service that messed up 90 pictures for a project.
I didn't have time to redo them that day so I waited till today.
I used this cvs because it was closer.
I was disappointed when I found out the online coupon had now expired.
The manager at this store, Henry honored it anyway.
Way to keep your customers happy.
I will be back.

Gotta love that drive-through service.
Close to home and they are pretty fast in responding to your needs.
Zip in and zip out, no problems.
They have two lanes.
Full service and a drop off only lane.
