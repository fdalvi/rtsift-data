Dr. Shelly Friedman is a kindly doctor whose bedside manner is swift, but efficient.
His office staff are nice.
His billing methods are borderline fraudulous and his single billing person works out of state, never returns phone calls, and was a Class Act whenever I spoke with her.
The same goes with the office staff in regards to billing.
They are required to adhere to insurance companies' payment plans with which they have contracts.
Mine approved a procedure after it met the minimum criteria to make it a medical procedure.
It cost me $450 out of pocket, agreed to be reimbursed if my insurance paid.
My insurance company paid to their agreed upon price of $227, which means the office owed me the rest.
The office won't pay, despite their contract, and despite my insurance company stepping in and stating they need to lower the cost to the agreed upon price.

Amazing!!
From the moment you call for an appointment you are treated like a person they already care about.
Dr. Friedman and each one of his staff members are amazing people with a real passion for their field.
If you are thinking about going in, do it!
You will not be disappointed!

Dr. Friedman is the best.
He and his staff are always so friendly and helpful.
I am very happy with their service, professionalism, and quality of care.

Everything they said it would be!
Starting with the consult; they were polite and helpful in providing me with the best options to suit my concerns.
Dr. Friedman was very professional and the entire process was pain free for me, both physically and mentally.
The procedure went off without any problems.
The entire staff was helpful before, during and even now after the surgery.
I have thought about having this done for a long time and after my consult with Carly, I felt like this was the time.
I couldn't be more satisfied.
