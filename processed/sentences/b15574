Byron, at Best Water Treatment installed and services our water filtering system.
It's so refreshing to find a competent and honest tradesman.
His work is excellent and his price is very reasonable.
We highly recommend him.

At the same time our outside spigot froze (see my review on Rakeman Plumbing), our 13 year old US Filter water softener exploded sending tiny beads into our plumbing.
We called Best Water Treatment (on the recommendation of Corky at Rakeman Plumbing).
Byron called back that evening and we set up an appointment for noon the next day.
He called and said he was running ahead of schedule and would be here in 15 minutes.
When Byron arrived, he wasted no time checking things out.
Turns out nothing was broken, just an old system being it self.
He said he could "flush out" the resin cylinder and it should be OK.
He discovered the tube in the resin cylinder was originally installed wrong, so he fixed that too.
Probably spent an hour and a half with our system.
Before he left, he double checked all the connections he had fiddled with just to make sure.
All this work for $45 !
Best Water Treatment is EXACTLY what the name implies.
Byron is the BEST.
No scare tactics, honest about what was wrong, did not try to sell us parts we did not need.
AWESOME !
We will absolutely recommend him !

Bryon is great!
He will let you know if you can wait a little longer for a repair or if  needs to be fixed right away.
My entire family has purchase our water softners from Byron!
