Bought a small travel trailer from Tom's.
Matt was our salesman and was great...very no-pressure and helpful with any questions.
2 years later I needed help with a copy of the invoice from my purchase...Matt faxed it to me in no time.
Talk about great customer service!
And the trailer is great too!

Such a great experience shopping for trailers here.
Helpful, no-pressure, no-rush.
Salesman Dave was great.
What a difference compared to our first RV shopping stop (see other review)!
I will update review once we actually purchase.

I came in today to look at the T@Bs and I spoke with Matt Duncan the general manager.
He was awesome!!
I asked a million questions and he took the time & answered all of them; he didn't seem rude and definitely had patience for me so that was great.
I am definitely buying one this yr  and hopefully he will still be there.
They were great; if you're looking for a tab or on rpod this is the place to buy them.
