Lori does an excellent job with Brazilian waxes.
She's quick and tries to make it as painless as possible.
Her facials are very relaxing.
Try the diamond microdermabrasion.
It does wonders!!!
After try one of her relaxing facials.
They make your skin tingle.
Lori is very professional and always willing to fit me in.
I definitely recommend her.

I was in to see Lori for a 1/2 leg, full Brazilian and facial yesterday.
First of all Lori is so sweet, and reassuring.
The room when you walk in feels warm and comforting.
It was my first Brazilian, and I was very nervous.
I've heard many stories!!
I must say  I didn't have much discomfort at all!!
Very happy with it.
The facial was fantastic!!
I almost fell asleep :) My dermabrasion was not painful during or after.
And I woke up today with tiny little pores!!
Yeah!!!!
I also am using her at home face regiment she hand put together for me.
My skin looks amazing already!!
So excited to see results after some consistent treatment.
I will review again in a few weeks!!
Lori is amazing!!

As a beauty professional, personal image and wellness is everything.
This is the first facial I have had since moving to Las Vegas, and Lori may be my last esthetician I will EVER have.
This facial was amazing and she doesnt take any shortcuts.
Lori uses the wonderful PCA skin line and has the best UV and steam equipment.
Having normal skin, its very easy to over or under treat my skin.
She know what shes doing and the best part is that you can feel her passion for skin through her services.

I've been coming to Lori for over a year now and will never go anywhere else.
I always get a full face wax and Lori is a perfectionist so i always leave extremely happy.
I am one of those annoying clients who never give notice or make appointments but Lori ALWAYS fits me in!
I have also had brazilians done and she is professional and gentle if thats possible lol.
Prices are always less than competitors.
Try nu Bella and it will be the last place you go for your skin care !!

Lori was amazing and very friendly.
Made me feel comfortable even with my first brazillian.
Very gentle and took her time!
I even went back for a facial and was the best facial I've ever had!

I just got my back facial here today and it was amazing!
My back feels so smooth!
Lori is such an amazing eastician, she really takes the time to make u happy, I hope no annoying, rude customers takes advantage of her.
My voucher was expired but she still gave me the whole promo which I'm so grateful for.
I'm usually weary of booking this kind of voucher but I read the amazing reviews first and thought why not.
I'll definitely be back for a pumpkin peel B-) and I can't wait to tell my friends and family about this salon.
Thanks lory!
I'm a very satisfied customer :-D

Lori is AMAZING!
She has given me great advice on my skin and I can totally see a difference!
Just did my first chemical peel and she told me everything to expect also said to make sure I don't react to severely my first time doing it she didn't do max  strength, which I appreciate!
Her prices are set so you can afford to keep coming back!
Another bonus...she's in a private room so you don't have to deal w/any annoying receptionist or other ppl.
It's just Lori and you!
I can't wait to try her new teeth whitening and I recommend her 'everything wax'!
:o)  Love this lady!

I love Lori.
She has a very sweet and calm demeanor.
She's been working on my problem skin for a while now.
Feels so good and relaxing.
I'm just so glad I found someone that can get to the root of my skin issues.
She can be quiet or personal, and I rather prefer personal.
She's a fun person to talk to.
I give her 10 Stars!

Lori is amazing.
She is quick, professional, accurate and funny.
I can't wait to come back to her!

I can't stop smiling about how meeting this woman changed my day!
She is a GODSEND!
Come on ladies, it's been cold so we're keeping our fur coats on *if you catch my drift*.
My first ever Brazilian and definitely not my last.
So it's not every day you meet a complete stranger, and strip down naked for a wax, but let me tell you... the vibe you get from this place and Lori is just so vibrant!!!!
She was very gentle.
I know it's hard to agree when there is hot wax being torn off with a small piece of fabric, but this lady is so professional.
She gave me great advice on waxing and how simple and easy it gets over time.
I found her through a GROUPON but I have to admit, her groupons are cool but talk to her and hear all her HOLIDAY SPECIALS.
THEY WILL BLOW YOUR MIND.
she does teeth whitening, facials and all over waxing.
Ladies look no further, I know it's a touchy and embarrassing subject, but here I have never been so comfortable.
I even told my mom and sisters about it because she was that great!!
The reviews don't lie, SHE'S AMAZING!!
You will all thank me later.
BUT THANK LORI FIRST!!!!

This was my first time getting a wax other than my eyebrows so I was definitely nervous.
Lori definitely took the time to explain everything and she ensured I was comfortable before beginning anything.
She was quick but thorough (I was there maybe less than 20 min) and she informed me when it would be a little more painful in some areas (since it was my first time).
She genuinely cares about your preferences amd listens to you when you ask her a question.
I will definitely be coming back to her in the future!

I first bought a living social for a facial and loved it so much I bought a package.
Lori is excellent at what she does and she's a nice person.
I usually do the pumpkin peel/microderm combo and I love it.
Lori really does cater to every client and I am happy to have found her!

Loved my experience with YELP and Nu Bella.
Lori is great.
My first time there and certainly not my last.
Her prices are great and bedside manor makes you comfortable.
