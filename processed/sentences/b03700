Had my last 5 or 6 haircuts here, usually the same gal, and they do an excellent job here, and its cheap!
Clean, friendly, get what you paid for kind of deal.
No surprises!
Much better than Great Clips!

Decent and cheap haircut with friendly stylists.
They cut me a little shorter than I would have liked but pretty good for $14.

This place has very talented girls that really belong in an upscale salon.
I am VERY picky and usually visit salons 3-4 times this expensive.
On a whim I tried this location for a quick trim (next to my house), and they blew me away.
All the cutters here have tats, personality, and serious experience.
Take advantage and get a great haircut for $15 - and you don't even need an appointment.
I DO NOT endorse any other Supercuts locations!!

Great place!
They really take the time to make sure you are happy before you leave, they do not rush you out the door.

2 of the best hair stylists in the east valley, J & Sarah.

Went here to have the 14 year old boy get his hair cut.
The price was fair at $14 and the girl was really nice and polite with him and did a great job.
I have heard horror stories in the past about this chain and was a bit skeptical but this just may be his new haircut location of choice.

The hair cut looked good.
Although, the Super Cuts across the street is $3 cheaper.
