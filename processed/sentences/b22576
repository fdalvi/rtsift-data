My father and his parents were interned during World War II at Butte Camp located on the Gila River Reservation.
Through out my childhood I had always been curious about history which lead to my social activism in college... this led me to years later becoming both a history teacher and high school counselor in an at-risk area back home in Norcal.
In coming to Arizona it was both to have fun but also acknowledge and respect my family's past.
In searching for where to get information I tried to find the Gila River Arts and Crafts Center but turned up empty handed.... or so I thought.
After a frustrating 30 minutes and another fail of our GPS we finally made it here to the HuHuGam Heritage Center....
There I met Robert Johnson.
Robert I owe you a lot....thank you so much for your information and encouragement in finding my past.
Robert has a wealth of knowledge and took the time to talk to me and answer as many questions as he could about the memorial dedicated to the WWII internees.
The museum is open until 4 PM and it is five dollars for adults and there are student discounts.
PLEASE NOTE: NO PHOTOGRAPHY OR FOOD IS ALLOWED.
The photographs are a collect from the 1970s and beyond capturing life in the Gila River Reservation.
There are also outside exhibits which have very informative explanations.
Although there is no Japanese American Internment exhibit they are working on it with the local/national JACL chapter (Japanese American Citizens League).
The place can be hard to find..... it is red and looks triangular.
There are no signs indicating it is a museum until you are almost there... kinda looks like a staircase... is near some canal looking ditches...
If you love photography this place is worth the drive.

Why would there be a "Japanese American Internment exhibit" at an indian Heritage center?

Wed to Fri 10a-4p hours
