WALGREENS PHARMACY DEPT.
I was at the location to fill a prescription.
First time was a breeze.
I called my prescriptions in for a refill and attempted to pick them up few days later, I ran into problems.
The pharmacy-assistants kept informing me to come back because they were having some problems with my worker's comp insurance.
The 3rd time I went back to the pharmacy, I spoke to a different person.
She also ran into the same problem with my worker's comp insurance but was very patient and thorough that she was able to resolve what the other assistants were not able to do.
After a month of going back and forth, I was finally able to fill my prescriptions and went home a happy camper!
THANK YOU Ms.
SOSHEE!!

I came in early enough to drop off my medication at the Walgreens pharmacy they told me it would be 20 minutes to get the refill so I waited I waited I waited and I never heard my name be called so all of a sudden it was 6:05 p.m.
The entire pharmacy was closed I went up to the front and I spoke to the supervisor there I forgot her name she has long curly hair she wears glasses for haiair color is blondish brown she's Hispanic and I told her to call back there and get someone because my prescriptions are there she did not want to call back to refuse to help me and then I had to keep asking her to please call back after I need my prescriptions pharmacist came up to the front he was able to give me my prescriptions ring me up and I was on my way so I had to call back the next day and report her to her manager and that was a waste of my time because she should have known that she could have helped me by simply just calling the pharmacist like I had to keep asking her to do I would not suggest the store to anyone

Has everything you could need, helpful staff, big parking lot.
