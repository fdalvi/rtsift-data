So much Wrangler in here.
This is redneck heaven!
I will definitely be back!

I love the VF outlet.
I first found it in Lake Elsinore CA and glad there is one here in AZ.. You definitely can not beat the prices.
This particular outlet has awesome prices for all Lee, Levi and Wrangler jeans plus shirts, blouses, socks, etc...I bought a pair of wrangler jeans for only $4.00 and they were priced at other stores for the same pair for more than $45.00....I ended buying two pairs of blue jeans, 1 pair of black jeans and a pair of purple slacks for less than $20.00...this place is a keeper plus if you let them send you texts, you get an additional 10% off each purchase plus if you sign up for emails another discount....these are all new products are amazing prices...great place to shop with great friendly staff.
