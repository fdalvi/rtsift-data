Called the office with tooth pain and they were able to see me right away in the evening.
Dr. Staten was very patient with me as I was very afraid.
The office was very clean and everything looked new and modern .
The girl at the front desk was also very knowlegable about my insurance.
I Plan on going back for a regular check up to make sure nothing else is going on.
I will recomend this place to all my friends and family

This is a great dentist office.
From the moment you walk through the door the staff is very warm and inviting.
You are received within minutes of your appointment time so they really respect their patients time.
The hygienist, office manager and staff really seem to enjoy what they do and they appreciate you as a client.
Most offices the staff is nice and do their job but in this office you feel their passion for their job and to serve you the patient.
The Dr. Is super cool.
I met her and her husband at a network event and when it came time to get my teeth cleaned I decided to visit her since I don't have a dentist in the valley.
It was a great experience.
I didn't feel pressured to get services I didn't need.
They complimented what I was doing well and encouraged me to keep at it.
I had a small cavity which we scheduled to fill right away.
It was so small she told me no novicaine but if I felt uncomfortable raise my hand and they would numb the area.
I think she was in and done with the tooth in less than 10 minutes.
I really appreciated not having a numb mouth for a few hours because that's just procedure.
I truly enjoy a professional who knows how to evaluate a situation and make the overall best decision when providing me a service
