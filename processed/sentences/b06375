I could not have been more pleased with my experience here.
They are fast, prompt, and extremely thorough.
Make sure you ask for Taylor as your hygienist.
She was absolutely amazing and you can tell she has a passion for her career.

Just changed dentist offices, after 15 years, due to a very  rude and unprofessional front end staff and billing.
While the dentist was good- dealing with the staff was not worth it.
Dr Wilson (our new dentist) is great!
Have known him for years- he and his staff treat the patients with respect and courtesy.
He is extremely gentle and makes the visit STRESSFREE.
His staff explains the procedures and answer your questions.
There are no surprises in billing!
One thing that  I want to mention is that he does not do unnecessary procedures.
If you only need a normal cleaning- that is what you will get..  His staff does not try to upsell every dental procedure on the market!
I highly recommend his office!

Dr. Wilson is awesome!
I have been going here for over 10 years.
He saved my life when I first met him.
Performed a miracle in my mouth.
The staff is great, especially Mary who has worked here as long as I have been going.
The Dental Hygienists are so great and funny.
They can always get you in sooner rather than later.
Dr. Wilson has great prices for people who do not have insurance.
He does a fantastic job at everything he does.
He is very patient and will explain everything to you.
If you don't need work done, he won't suggest it, just to get the extra money.
He would rather keep customers.
