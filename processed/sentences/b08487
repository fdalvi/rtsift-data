What can I say ladies!
You know we are all loyal to our hair ladies!
I've been seeing mine for over 10 years!
She was the first to dye my virgin hair and let me tell you it took her a full 2 years to do it!
I trust my hair stylist Alyssa with my hair!
I know you all know what I mean!
I now go in and just let her do what she does best, we mainly chat the entire time.
I have implicit trust!
If you are new in town or are looking to change, try Alyssa at Hair Do.
The prices are reasonable and she always does a great job!

I just went to Hair Do for the first time yesterday and I was sold.
Brandy did my hair and she did a great job.
I was so happy to get the hair cut for half price since I was a first time guest.
I will definitely be back.
The only drawback I saw was that things seemed cluttered and even dirty in some areas.
i dont think they dust very often at all.
Other than that, it was a good experience.

Love, love Hair-Do!
I moved to the East Valley a year ago and have been seeing Cami ever since for color and style.
I have recommended her to friends, family and coworkers.
Two thumbs up!

I moved to Gilbert, AZ July 2012.
I started to go to a salon and after a couple months my hair was very damaged from the stylist razoring it too many times.
This sent me searching for a new salon/stylist.
I went to Hair Do's website to review the stylist and scheduled an appointment with Bev.
Best thing that has happened to me since I moved to AZ!
She is AMAZING.
She has totally turned my unhealthy hair into healthy hair.
She takes the time with you each visit to make sure you get what you want and will make suggestions as needed!
I highly recommend scheduling an appointment with Bev!
