Arizona Mills itself is not super desirable however this store is pretty nice.
It's really organized, there weren't any areas of the store that had clothes thrown everywhere which I've totally seen in other Gap Outlet locations.
The merchandise they had was nice, I found my favorite sports bra in neon pink, so I'm excited!
If you're willing to go to Arizona Mills check it out.

There always seems to be a ton of great deals on men's clothing.
My husband never leaves empty handed.
I wish I could say the same for the women's clothing.
I never seem to find a good deal....
The kid's/baby's clothing is really cute, yet extremely expensive.
I enjoy browsing though.

Loyal Gap / Banana Republic / Old Navy Customer here!
Love that they have short length pants for us "short and curvy" gals.
Saves me a trip to alterations.
What to say about this location?
Fantastic selection, awesome outlet steals on women's clothing.
Love the Friends and Family 40% off weekend sales.
So why one star then?
Customer Service leaves much to be desired.
Rude associates; God forbid you ask them to do their jobs should you need a different size, etc.
Expect sheer annoyance.
Of course I'm not surprised being this Arizona Mills and all.
Why do I still come back to witness some "Social Darwinism in action" then?
Outlet.
That's about it.
