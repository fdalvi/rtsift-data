Had Idetail come and detail my boat that needed to be detail we set up a date he was on time and show me test spot before starting the work on the boat it was pretty oxidize I didnt think it would come out but it did even all my friend where surpised about how good of job he did on it now I need to have him do my car as well I have found a detailer now

Idetail always does a great job.
They're always on time, professional, and have a high attention to detail.
I can appreciate the attention to detail being in the military.
You can always expect great work, and I don't think I'll be taking my business to anyone else anytime soon.

Save your time by not calling and do not purchase a voucher through Yelp.
I've called 3 times in the last 2 weeks after purchasing a voucher, went to voice-mail every time, left 2 messages, and no call or text back.
I gave it some time and gave them the benefit of the doubt in case they were backed up or busy but 2 weeks is too long.
I'll be issuing a chargeback on the voucher and looking a different mobile detailer that will answer my call or get back to my messages.
