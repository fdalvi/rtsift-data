We have used this company for many years and have been so pleased with the level of service.
We bought a water cooled unit that is difficult to get parts for and needs a lot of TLC.
Paul and his crew always find a way to keep us up and running.
We have an ongoing maintenance agreement with them and they are great about reminding us twice a year to make an appointment to have heating/cooling inspected.
Service is great and prices are fair.
Nice to have a company we can trust.

It doesn't get any better.
We just hired this company to install our Nest Thermostat and 4 Nest Protect: Smoke + Carbon Monoxide Alarm's in our home.
The installers were prompt, knowledgeable and educated us on all the products features.
It was a pleasure doing business with them and we are enjoying our Nest Products.
Thank you Comfort Masters!

These guys are great, Ive only had Brandon come to my house, but he's always a pleasure, shoes off without asking him to, tolerates my crazy dogs, cleans up after any mess.
Ive had them service my AC a few times and clean out my air ducts.
They're a small company, so you get the sense they really care about their service.

Had a great experience with Comfort Masters!
I called and a scheduler made an appointment for me and was very accommodating to my work schedule.
Paul called to follow up and made sure he had all the right information so he would be prepared on the morning of the appointment.
He showed up early and I had him install the smart wifi Honeywell thermostat.
He ran into some roadblocks but knew exactly how to handle it.
He was very professional and kind.
He even took off his shoes before he came in which I didn't even ask him to; found that very thoughtful.
If I ever have any AC/heating issues in the future, I'll use this great family business!
