Great friendly Frozen Yogurt spot in Mesa.
They have 12 flavors that are changing periodically.
It is pay by weight and they have tons of great toppings.
The yogurt has a great taste and the only place I have been too that has a higher protein Greek yogurt as well.
They are conscious about nut allergies and over just have a helpful staff.
Very kid/family friendly place.

Welcome to the neighborhood Yummiville!
You have just became our new favorite yogurt spot.
Good quality yogurt for us yogurt snobs and priced great for the price sensitive yogurt shoppers...

It's a self serve yogurt shop.
It's ok but nothing to rave about.
You could probably get better service & Thrifty ice cream from Water & Ice up the street.

This Yummiville Yogurt is indeed yummy.
Previously a Golden Spoon this place is a do it yourself fill up yogurt station.
They had a very nice array of flavors.
I tried fruit punch and pink lemonade sorbet swirl with gummy bears and strawberries.
Mine got runny a bit quicker than my husbands.
It could have been the flavor I chose or perhaps my yogurt machine wasn't as cold.
(No big deal) It was perfect for summer.
My husband tried the birthday cake with chocolate sauce which he loved.
The place was clean and the staff very friendly.
They will let you try the flavors before hand.
They have little paper cups you can use which I like much better than the plastic spoons at other places.
I have always worried people stick the old spoons in with the clean ones so I NEVER sample anything.
With the paper cups you know that isn't happening.
Ask the server if you don't see them as they are near the toppings.
Will be back for some more yummy yogurt!
