My staple coffee stop for work.
The clerks are ultra-friendly, hook me up with those stamped coffee cards, the place is always clean and it shares the building with a McDonalds.
What else can be said about a gas station convenience store?

Cheapest credit card gas in the area and none of those ridiculous upcharges or hidden fees that make Terrible's, Shell, or Arco so annoying.
Clean, well lit, and convenient.

Be aware gas price on sign is cash/chevron card only !
Normal is 7 cents higher !
Prior to this, this, aside from the flamingo and durango location, had a competitive low pricing in the area.
Was a very convenient location, and good prices.
Now after they changed the sign, and the never knowing rate of change for prices, i'm not too sure on their pricing at the moment.
Chances are, i'll still use this gas station due to its convenience from being down the street and on the way, in most cases, for most times.
Attached to a mcdonalds for a quick bite, if needed.
Friendly staff working inside.
Good for picking up drinks (water or sport drinks before going out to play sports or something)
