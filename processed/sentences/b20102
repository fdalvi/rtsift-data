Pizza Hut's lunchtime buffet might have been a rare treat at high school, but nowadays it's just too much hassle.
Fighting with proles and lardarses over the last bit of pepperoni is a hassle I can do without when I've got a deskload of soul destroying monotony to get through as soon as I leave.
Inevitably I'd end up stuck with a few slices of margahrita / veggie "surprise", and a bitter taste in my mouth not entirely down to the e-coli ridden cheese.
It's popularity amongst screaming kids and Lidl shoppers means a sit down experience isn't great here at the best of times to be honest, but despite it's obvious, and numerous flaws, there's no denying the pizzas are fantastic in their own way.
A greasy, saturated fat-laden Meat Feast won't do you any harm once in a while.
Probably.
