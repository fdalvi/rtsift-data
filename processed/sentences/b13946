Hard to give a compelling review on a fast food joint, but the server was nice and charged me $5 instead of $5.25 for my footlong.
That's my definition of a huge win at Subway.
Minimal homeless people, semi-questionable meats and a smell-free environment as much as humanly possible.
A definite win :)

The service could not be any worse at this location.
We arrived about 9:30 p.m., which was 1/2 hour before closing time, but they already had the wet floor cones out and the floor was sopping with mop water.
When we got to the counter, TWO employees were standing there, but neither of them bothered to look up at me to ask what I would like to order.
I specifically stood there silent waiting for one of them to speak to me, and neither did.
Finally, I asked if I could place my order and one girl replied, ok, but still never looked up at me.
I told her my order and she couldn't have been less enthusiastic if she tried.
I don't expect cartwheels and high fives, but eye contact and a Thank You would have been nice!
Avoid this location if you can drive 1.5 miles to the other Gilbert store.

Very unfriendly service!

the one star is purely for the customer service.
The girl making my sandwich tore my bread by accident and when I asked her if she would kindly replace it instead of continuing to make my sandwich, she got the BIGGEST ATTITUDE ever.
You would have thought I asked her to cook me a 5 course meal lol She threw the bread on the ground and didn't even answer me, proceeded to grab a new piece of bread and made my sandwich.
Maybe she was having a bad day, and I was the straw that broke this camels back.
lol anyways, I wont be back.
I don't feel like being treated that way.
Both girls working were super young and obviously didn't want to be there or talking to people.
Management should get on that.
