Of all of the Panda Express chains I have ever tried (from Kihei, Maui, to Las Vegas, NV and now here in the Phoenix area), this one tops them all.
Staff is always nice (which is an added bonus when you get that in any of these types of non tipping establishments) and the food is always good.
They seemed to have beefed up their beef in the their beef and broccoli (but that could just be a coincidence/luck of the draw, whatever...you know what i mean).
Did you ever notice it isn't actually called beef and broccoli, but rather broccoli beef?
haha.
Anyway, if you like Panda's, and you live in the Glendale/Peoria area, it is worth it to go to this one rather than one that may be closer to you.

I would like to review Panda in the way that I feel about thier food.
Panda...............................................

The service is good.............................
The portions are adequite...................................
But you are sooooo...............................BORING.
I have never really been a fan but the oldest kids loves that stuff.
It was her turn to pick the lunch and I had to go with it.
There is nothing wrong but nothing great either.

Basic Chinese food, good enough for lunch.
Always hot food.
Good service.
Clean dining room.
Parking leaves a little bit to be desired.

Perfect!
Staff was friendly and offered samples!
Loved the new sesame honey chicken.
This location has the soy sauce out for your convenience.
Some can be stingy about that.
Food was hot and fresh.
Delicious dinner tonight!

This is by far the best panda I've ever been to they are always so nice and pleasant.
I've never had a problem here and they give me bigger portions than the other ones I have gone too.
I always mix up what I get from here.
I really miss the sesame chicken they had.
I hope they bring it back soon  The place is always clean and neat

They let every other food item except orange chicken run absolutely down until there is no more.
I'm sure this is some type of business strategy, but gosh I'd sure love to have something other than fried rice and orange chicken.
Mixed veggies to be specific.
They offer to make more of the item, but they don't seem to be happy about it and are quick to offer what's left, a couple sliced carrots.
Every time I go for dinner this happens.
Unless you're there for the lunch rush, be prepared to not have your item ready.
On the bright side, at least it's fresh.
Kind of.
