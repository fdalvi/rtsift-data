this is the only stand-alone hot dog place in the neighborhood & it is usually really good.
this time it was late & everything was old & bad  even for $6 it was not a good deal  you would be better off going to 7-11 and taking your chances at any old gas station

I was telling a friend about my singular experience with Wienerschnitzel, and she reported similar feelings, so I thought I should warn others about my experience.
I ate at this location once when I was in high school, before I became very health-conscious, and it was a very memorable experience because it was so unpleasant.
I can't remember exactly what I ordered, but it was one of the hot dogs with onion and peppers on it, which I remember were overly greasy, soggy and limp.
It looked like gelatinous mush.
There was no pride or integrity in the way it was put together.
I don't know how to describe the taste exactly, but I clearly remember that it didn't taste natural or right.
It tasted unnatural and wrong, like is was tainted in some way.
For some reason -- I guess i was hungry and didn't want to waste my money -- I ate the whole hotdog.
I remember feeling queasy afterwards, like my stomach had been insulted and abused.
That was the day I made a personal vow never to eat at Wienerschnitzel again, and I am reaffirming that vow today.

Once again Yelp..Update!!!!
This location is not a current Weinerschnitzel, it's a Loan Mart.
