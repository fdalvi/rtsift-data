A tucked-away Stockbridge gem that has been on my list of places to try for some months and it still is!
How, you may ask, can I be reviewing a restaurant I have yet to try?
Well, dear reader, I went there last week for a work christmas party and had a very good time.
But I remember very little of the evening.
THAT's how good a time I had.
A small, cosy, intimate restaurant with a Mexican theme; the staff managed to make a party of 12 seem not only welcome, but a joy to behold (I'm not sure this sentiment was shared by the other diners).
The menu is classically Mexican, but the execution is a class above the bog-standard.
Nachos, natch; chimichangas, burittos and enchilladas ditto, but all done (reportedly) to perfection.
There are also Mexican style steaks and fish for the less conventional.
There may be puddings; I can't remember.
They do serve cocktails and liquers, for which I hold them entirely responsible.
So, as I said at the outset, I shall return to The Blue Parrot Cantina for a more sedate and considered meal as soon as they let me back in the door.

The Blue Parrot is a quirky little place in Stockbridge.
The chicken and cashew chimichanga I had was extremely good, packed with mountains of succulent chicken.
Their soup was tasty, also.
Service wasn't quite what it could have been, and their cellar-conversion toilets will divide opinion, but it's well worth a visit.
Overall, we said: "I was impressed with the Blue Parrot.
It served me two good dishes, in quirky surroundings...I'm not the world's biggest fan of Mexican food, not least because over the years I've eaten in some very ropey Mexican places around Edinburgh, but I'd happily head back here the next time I'm feeling the need.
