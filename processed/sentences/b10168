I love the Girl Scouts and what they stand for.
I came to the office to go to the shop.
I was greeted in a friendly manner and showed where the Daisy items were.
After reviewing my items, the associate asked if there wasn't another item I needed.
She was right.
I looked around for a little bit and adored all the cute items.
Bought my Daisy a little necklace.
Check was fast and simple.

The Girl Scouts taught me so much!
if it wasn't for them I would have never loved camping as much as I do.

Ok Girl Scouts has changed a lot from when I was a kid.
The shop is great with friendly staff and helpful people.
They helped me order some badges for my troop, they had a nice selection of stuff for all ages and in multiple visits I was able to get everything I wanted each time.
The front desk staff is friendly and helpful.
They are efficient too.
Each time I have had training with different team members it has been easy and informative.
Each time I have contacted someone with new troop questions they have been quite helpful.
The program is great offering amazing adventures for all ages appropriate for their ages.
Between the staff and the program upgrades this organization is underrated as it also has a great premise The only reason it lost a star is location.
I don't believe it's in an easy to access neighborhood or in the best area for a large group of young kids.
