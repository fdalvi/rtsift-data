I love what Project Lodge is attempting to accomplish in the Madison area.
However, their less than admirable professionalism causes them to miss out on many great events, not to mention mismanage events like being burglarized.
My friend's piece of silver artwork was stolen from this venue (along with another artist's work) and they were very shady about the entire ordeal.
*Because the Project Lodge recently reached out to me, I thought it fair to add to my original review that the "Pro Lo" has as of 2011 obtained new management.
Furthermore, nothing of the sort has surfaced since new management has taken over.

We really like this place.
Some of their projects are really unique, like the pop up shops.
I am sorry to read about someone's artwork being stolen and then the management not handling this correctly.
I would hope that they have insurance and also work for better security.
What PL is doing is really fantastic.
I wish there were places like this back when I was 20 something.
We look forward to our next visit to PR to see what they have to offer next.
