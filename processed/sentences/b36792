Worst service I've ever gotten at a 7-11 in my entire Life !!
Walked in to purchase a 12oz Frappacino and a bag of chips.
Stood at the counter for 5 mins while other customers began to line up behind me.
No one at the counter or anywhere else in the store.
An indian-looking lady finally emerges from the back room totally focused on her smart-phone and sits down and continued to play with her phone totally ignoring the customers at the counter !!!
One older customer leans over the counter and yells "Hello !!!!
" she continued to ignore him !
After the 3rd time she finally looks up with a blank stare.
At that time I slammed my merchandise on the counter and left the store.
Unbelievable !

I've been in this store a few times but mostly all at night or early AM.
I have never have had any issues with service.
It's conventionally located to home.
It's open 24/7 & has most things one may need.
Prices are a little more expensive vs Wal-Mart but you pay for the convenience!
