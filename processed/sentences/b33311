Took my bike in to be tuned.
Looked brand new when I picked up, earlier than promised time.
Highly recommend.

Website states that Pebbe Creek residents can get pick up and delivery on bikes dr service..
I stopped in today to set it up,  I was told by the individual They no longer do that but haven't  updated their site.
Also said not open on Sunday.
Very unpersonable and  indifferent to customer.
I will be posting this comment on the pebble creek website also.
There are approx 4000 homes in the area.
They need to update their website so people do not make a wasted trip.
Also Abe a little more customer friendly might be helpful.

Not so ultimate as I thought.
Very small selection and no greeting or offer of assistance as a friend and I browsed through the store.

These guys have gone above and beyond to help me get my bike ready to ride.
They truly seem to care more about the sport then just making money.
