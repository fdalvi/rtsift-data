I was leaving the bank when a roach that was about five inches long crawled across the tile.
Being the man that I am, I diverted my course and walked fifty feet out of the way to avoid it.
The nice woman that was helping Dallas G and me set up our account smote the roach with a rebel yell and two strikes of her foot.
one star, only because I can't put zero stars

IF I could give this bank a zero star..
It would get it.. as of today, Im no longer a client.. Im placing my hard earned, low yielding funds with USAA.. where I have been happy for over 15 years.. STUPID me for thinking that when I took a job locally here with a locally based airline that I should also have a local based bank.. WRONG.. and FAIL.. the story begins when on a layover last year someone used my debit/credit card to order over $900 worth of creatine and muscle producing products.. THAT wouldnt be me!
Because IM a 5'2 , 120 lb girl..
I dont need nor do I want any bs like that..
Does my bank believe me..
GUESS not!
NO..
THEY want me to do the leg work and call the company in question.. bc I HAD a layover in said city in the past 30 days and it was 'questionable' as the rude customer service person at BOFA stated.... WOW.. way to go.. over and over I saw the same $900 go into and out of my acct over the past 9 mths.. silly me..
I will say that most of the money has gone back into my acct.
BUT not without alot of headache by me.. and I am the innocent party here..
I simply detest this bank.. AND as a person who was frauded.. all of this was uncalled for..
I dont recommend this bank to anyone..

This branch is the closest to where I work, and therefore the branch I use the most.
I've had to do multiple money orders/card replacements/account opening/account merging operations here and never had any problems.
The previous two reviews call out issues that have nothing to do with this branch, so I'm a bit perplexed as to why they are trying to ding the business.
(Fraud claims go through a centralized customer service center via phone, and insects live everywhere & sadly infiltrate even the best business regardless of efforts to prevent it)  This location has a very attentive and consistent staff.
I've been visiting them for years, and see the same friendly faces regularly.
I appreciate that, and I think it shows well.
If a company takes care of their staff, they're more likely to take care of customers in my opinion and experience.
Drive through banking/ATM's as well as a 24/7 outdoor ATM available.

This Bank of America location is just okay.
I go here for both personal and merchant banking and it frustrates me that on the lunch hour they only have two bankers windows open.
Today I waited for at least fifteen minutes with only one person in line a head of me because all of the merchants were dropping deposits and of course it was taking a very long time to count them through.
The banker at the counter was very nice and made nice conversation with me but this location needs to be more efficient.

It's an okay branch.
Just needed to deposit some money, in and out of the branch in less than 5 minutes.
There was a security guard on-duty when I visited this afternoon.
It's right across from Chandler Fashion Center off Loop-101, easy access anywhere.
