These guys are great, even work on Saturday!
I have used them a few times and the do come all the way out to the NW valley.
I was referred to them and have been pleased.
They always call when they are on their way just like they said they would and their prices are fair.
What else is there?
I've had them rebuild a few of my toilets and now are bidding a gas line for my stove since it is currently electric and we want a gas stove top.
Price was very fair.

I always call irun plumbing for any plumbing work I need!
I recently had a leak and Isaac the owner came out right away to fix it!
Their office staff is very nice and helpful, I highly recommend irun plumbing!

Isaac with his son in law arrived on time.
He called per my request upon arrival.
He promptly did the work.
Took care of my leaking shower.
Absolutely alleviated my stress due to the old unit.
The job was more difficult than anticipated but the price was fair.
Great to work with.
Thanks guys!
