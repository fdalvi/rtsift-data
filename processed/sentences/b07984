Great pharmacy and the reward points program is very nice, I have already received four $5 discounts and I haven't been using it too long.

I am not a Walgreens fan much anymore as most of the time their pharmacy staff are rude and simply just not helpful.
However, this location is open 24 hours and that is why I am fan.

Well I am trying to think of a nice way to phrase just how terrible this pharmacy is.
I am a Walgreens customer, but my normal Walgreens is not 24 hours and so therefore sometimes I am forced to use this place.
I hate it.
The area is not the best, the staff are jerks, and the service is possibly top 10 worst.
I have never not had to wait in a 10+ minute wait line.
I guess a positive is that they forwarded the prescription to another 24 hour pharmacy correctly?
Don't go.
Drive further and go elsewhere.
