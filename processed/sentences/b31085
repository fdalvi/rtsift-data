As a Massage therapist I really need to get worked on to make up for all the massages I give.
Kristi is my go-to massage therapist.
With over 20 years of experience in the healing arts she's got amazing strength and sensitivity.
AND--she's a great listener--it's kind of like getting a counselor and therapist all in one shot.
It's the best hour of my week!

Kristi is amazing when it comes to massage.
I went to see her for one of her aromatherapy relaxing massages and was in total bliss!
After a stressful day of running appointments for work and taking care of my three year old I can't imagine a better way to end my week!

I have enjoyed working with Kristi Dee Doden and The Mindful Way for about 10 years.
I have had the benefit of her skills as both a massage therapist and a communications coach.
While I always enjoy her body work, through Kristi's workshops, I have learned tools on how to relate compassionately to myself and ultimately to others.
This has had the most impact on me.
I appreciate her ability to hold a sense of safety for me when issues feel overwhelming.
I trust that she can help me find a win-win result to particularly emotional situations.
I experience great personal growth under Kristi's guidance and I find myself turning to her often for support and clarity.
She is a very effective listener and I am glad that I have found her in my life.
