Stick to UPS store FedEx Stores or other places Sorry service wasn't great and I don't suggest anyone should come here.
They have hiding fees/ plus its pricey and don't tell you until they ring you up.
I also question the credentials of one of the workers.
How can you be licensed to preform services and you are having comprehension issues.
I had to tell this person several times the correct information and how to do it.
It was still done wrong and I had to go waste money and go somewhere else.

Linda and Marvin are wonderful.
I look forward to picking up my mail and seeing them each week!

Fingerprinting review only.
You have to fill out your info online and then they review your info before you can even make an appointment.
I waited a business day before I was given the ok to make an appointment.
The appointment times seemed like it was every 10 minutes so I knew it wasn't going to take very long at all.
I went inside and was a lil confused about where it was until I saw the fingerprint machine.
The lady made me take off my rings and she sprayed some sort of liquid (water?
) onto my finger tips which I had to dry on my pants.
The whole process took less than 5 minutes which was pretty quick.
It's just your standard FBI background check and it doesn't include local or state jurisdictions which I find weird since I did pay $50 bucks for it.
In any case it was quick, easy and now I can move on with my life.
Oh yea the background check took about 5 minutes for my email to come up with my report.
The lady said it could take longer if there's history on there or if the system is really busy.

Nice people, slow shipping, pricey jewelry repair, average notary service.
The people are nice, but there's alot of negative  things that I had experienced when doing business with them.
1st experience:  Shipping an item I sold on eBay.
I followed the tracking, and it took close to a month and a half for my item to reach it's destination.
Luckily I kept in contact with the buyer on eBay, and we were able to work things out.
Needless to say, I no longer ship items from this business.
2nd experience:  Watch adjustment.
I had some links removed, and the prices were ridiculous when compared to other places.
I took my watch to an outlet, and they did the adjustments on the same day for half the price.
Second strike, not looking good.
3rd experience:  Using the notary service.
The prices are on par with other locations, however the staff had input the wrong information forcing me to make a new copy.
What made it really bad was that I shipped the item long distance and found out later that it was not properly filled out.
They did honor my request to have a new one done free of charge.
To sum it up, I would think twice before shipping an item from here, go elsewhere for watch adjustments/jewelry repair, and be sure to double and triple CHECK your information when using their notary service.

I was so excited when I realized there was a close place to home to drop off my pre-paid for postal packages a few months ago.
The Lady seemed really nice the first day, but as I continued to come by and drop packages she became uninterested in even raising her head to say hello back to me.
I just thought she was probably grumpy for some other reason...but then 2 days ago I drop off 5 packages.
All of these were pre-paid Priority tracking.
Yesterday 3 of the packages show up on the tracking system but 2 of them don';t.  Again today I check the tracking and these same 2 packages are still not being tracked.
So I figure I'll go visit her and see if they fell out of the box or misplaced before I contact the post office.
She keeps her drop off box in an open area where you drop your own parcels (That way she doesn't have to be bothered).
When I asked very politely, she grumbles with her back to me that I need to take my grievance up with USPS cause she's not RESPONSIBLE.
OK...lost my trust right there.
Too easy for someone to grab parcels from the box...her back is almost always turned, and she lets off an air that she is just to busy to deal with you.
After contacting the post office they insisted that the carrier only got 3 packages not 5.
As far as Jewelry,a few months ago she said I should talk to her husband in regards to fixing an expensive diamond pendant, she said, he'll take real good care of you.
Yeah, for 75.00.
I just thought for such a small thing it was pricey.
I got it fixed for 12.00 at the indoor swapmeet and it's perfect.
Since the day I said No, too expensive, I've gotten nothing but the cold shoulder from her.
These 2 lost packages will cost me 75.00 and I am not happy about that.
If they are not responsible for your mail.....why would you go there?
If she's too busy to maintain integrity and the safety of our parcels maybe she should slow down on her additional hobbies of selling Handbags and Avon and concentrate more on her store.
