as this has been my first time with a chiro, i really have nothing to compare it to, but i have been so pleasantly surprised with the customer service and the results that i'm showering CAS chiropractic with 5 stars.
they must only hire the friendliest people in phoenix (seriously, not the nicest town, but these folks are MINNESOTA nice.
)  they all know my name, where i'm from, and what i do (and ask about such things!
) after only a few visits.
my hips feel much better while running, and i can do the elliptical without my feet going numb (a big plus, because that's generally pretty disconcerting).
BRAVO CAS chiropractic!

I am so impressed with Dr. Cas and the staff.
They spend so much time on you unlike those quick in-and-out chiropractic offices.
Dr. Cas spent a lot of time going over my x-rays and explained every bone and muscle that was compromised.
They always take their time and are completely amazing.
I would highly recommend this place!
