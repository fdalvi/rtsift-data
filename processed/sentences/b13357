If you stay here you might not wake up with your kidneys and your car will most likely be stolen.
Splurge and stay closer to city center.
I took one look at this place and called and cancelled my reservation.
If the clerk needs bullet proof glass you know it is a bad sign for you.

This is the worst place I've ever stayed at.
It was in the seediest area of Phoenix and the minute I checked in I was scared to goto sleep.
The clerk was behind bullet proof glass and wasn't very helpful.
There was no phone in the room,the bathroom wasn't lit enough and there was a soap left over from the previous guest.
I was in Phoenix to celebrate my birthday and staying there was NOT the place I imagined staying at for my birthday.
Do NOT book this place at all.
I noticed that they have a sticker for Trip Advisor and I was told that is a great site to check out hotels/motels.
Their pictures are very misleading.
I immediately checked out into some place safer.

I don't think I've ever been more concerned for my safety than the hour I stayed here.
Checked in, creeped out and waited for my taxi to come back and get me the hell out of there.
That made up my hour.
The taxi driver that dropped me off told me, "if you stay here, lock your door and do not come out.
"  I was fine until my door wouldn't stay locked and especially after I noticed the peep-hole was plastered closed.
And just for clarification, it's the BEST WEST INN MOTEL.
had I known it was a motel, I would have never selected it.
