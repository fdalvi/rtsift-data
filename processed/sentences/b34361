These guys only charge $50 for a 1 year warranty, provided you have no current termite activity.
I have had termites several times in the past and they still only charge $50 to bring the home under warranty.
So glad to have found them.

Called Protection Termite to take care of bees building a hive on my house eave.
Steve came out the next morning at 6:00 and quickly took care of the problem.
The price was even less than expected.
If you need bee removal service I would highly recommend Protection Termite Control.

Love these folks for my termite inspections!
They do a GREAT job for my buyers and will coordinate their schedules with my home inspector to do all the inspections at once.
If a home is clear of termites Protection termite will warranty that home for a year!
Highly Recommended!
