My husband and I were in town for CES, and decided to rent a car for the weekend, getting it from our hotel nearly doubled the price of the car rental, so we took a cab here to the airport terminal to get our car directly from AVIS.
I do NOT recommend getting your car from the hotel because while it may be convenient, nearly doulbe the price is just highway robbery.
And the gentleman who I spoke to on the phone who said, "there is a small increase in price if you pick it up at your hotel", was the king of understatement!
Beatrice helped us at the AVIS counter and she was great!
Very personable and helpful, she made our visit a quick in and out!

We chose this location since we could walk there-we chose to use valet at our hotel down the street once we got the car.
We got a red camaro which was pretty funny although as we drove it we didn't really love it-as it has a lot of blind spots.
I have a comment about renting cars in general that is not just about this location-which is that the insurance thing feels like a HUGE scam.
Your credit card provides some kind of coverage but the agents ALWAY freak you out and then you end up getting a bunch of stuff they want to sell you.
(You need insurance and there are different laws in different states) I just don't like a lot of the tactics they use.
Returning the car we ALL the Avis spots in the MGM lot were filled but we got as close as we could and they said it wasn't a problem.
