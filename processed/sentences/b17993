They sell $10,000 Symbian phones but built with the most amazing build quality you could imagine.
Now, that eliminates basically everyone reading this review from being a potential paying customer of theirs; you probably have a modern smart phone, that cost between $100 and $500 with a two-year contract, and are quite happy with it.
But that's not why they get two-stars, since reviews have to be in the context of the store, and you can't ding a store just because the target market for, again, a $10,000 Symbian phone is tiny.
So why ding it?
Because the guy who was working there didn't know his product well; he couldn't explain basic features of the phone, he couldn't make it sound exciting, and he couldn't make it a good "experience".
Considering a for vast majority of their foot traffic, they're trying to sell the "awesome" behind the brand, with an emphasis on "awe", this is a major problem.
It gets two stars instead of one, because I think the whole thing is kind of cool, and worth poking your head in if you're at the Wynn already.

This is basically a high fashion phone.
Ranging anywhere between $9,000-$500,000 The gentleman was an African american gentleman, very knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful, very informative.
We obviously weren't there to buy one but we were intrigued.
So we perked up and asked him questions regarding what makes them so much better...He was very thorough.
Even pulled one out and showed us the quality of the product, let us know what it was made from, and how people can go really crazy decking one of these accessory phones out!
lol I won't be purchasing one, but am thankful for the quality of help and information that was given to us, and felt I should write about it.
