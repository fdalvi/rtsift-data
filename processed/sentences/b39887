I like this shopping park as it saves me going into town.
There's parking provided and bus stops near by.
Only annoying thing is that the majority of ATM's are on one side (near boots and WH smith).
Alot of the normal high street stores are here.
there could be better public toilets in the actual park rather than the management suites that are tucked behind the back in a far away corner.
I would like to see some better eateries here as it get a little boring with the chains ie coffee or coffee or pizza zzzzzzz.
only thing at the weekends it does get rather busy ... do yourself a favour if you want to keep your sanity stay away!
