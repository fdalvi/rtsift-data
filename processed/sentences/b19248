I came here a few years back and found the food delicious, but I thought I was just hungry.
Now, I've been going there quite often to grab me the 17a: braised beef noodle soup.
Not only that, it seems to me that EVERYTHING there is delicious (including the rice combos).
The owner of the restaurant is REALLY nice, and always says "thank you" (even when HE'S pouring YOU the tea).
Great service, great food, can't complain!

Cool!
It's Home Garden.
I love this place even though I think it is only so-so.
Food tastes like home cooking, great for home sick students.
The best part is the owner is super friendly, he never fails to disappoint me.
Prices are good too and they serve dark meat!

I am a Taiwanese student at the University of Waterloo and Home Garden is the only restaurant that makes me feel at home.
The food suits my taste, but the best part is how welcoming the place feels.
The owner of the restaurant personally serves the customers, he by far has the best service in any restaurant I have went to in this country.
No matter what you ask for, he will always respond with a big smile.
Onto the food, I would avoid the noodles since they tend to be a bit soggy.
I love their rice combos and their water boiled beef (I forgot the exact name).
Highly Recommended!

11a as well as squid balls are awesome

This is the only Taiwanese restaurant in waterloo.
The food is decent: especially that marinated egg and the prices are student friendly.
The owner is the nicest guy in the world.
Don't expect any decor, and expect to wait a bit when they are busy.

Vey good food.
The service is excellent.
The waiter is very nice and always makes sure you are getting the best food
