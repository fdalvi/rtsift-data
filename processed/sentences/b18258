Nope, I'm not a Mom yet - actually no where close to being a mom, but I wanted to check out this place since the windows look really cute, they have a very clever name, and they took the place of what used to be a "Good Egg.
"  Cindy C. and I went in this afternoon, and we both agreed that indeed, this store was not somewhere we would shop... but they do have a wide selection of clothing that is stylish for moms!
We looked at some of the cute t-shirts and were a bit appalled when we saw the price tag at $50 - for a t-shirt!
So, my rating is based on the fact that it's an average store for me... but my mom may give it 5 stars since it's more her kind of store.
I will take her there next visit and change my rating accordingly.
Until then, I recommend this story to moms who want to look cute and don't have to worry about a budget!

This is the perfect place to find the "perfect" dress for Phoenix summer!
I have purchased several of the Patio Dresses by Veronica M, and I basically live in them.
