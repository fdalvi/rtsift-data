I love Ashman.
Clean, quiet but not too quiet, and a big selection for being a branch.
New holds tend to come in pretty fast, because Ashman often orders new releases (and MPL goes down the holds list in order at wherever the item happens to be - so even if someone from Ashman is 50th overall, but Ashman orders the only copy, that person will get it first).
I suppose as a former employee I might be a little biased, but of the five or so libraries in the area I've been to, it's my favorite.

This library gets all 5 stars (which I don't know that I've ever handed out to any establishment in the past) for their friendly staff, prompt service, and comfortable atmosphere.
Simple as that.
For a small library (I moved here from Chicago so I imagine any library would seem small to me...) they seem to have a reasonable mix of genres and the staff does a wonderful job staying on top of "Holds" placed online.
I don't have kids, but this library offers kid friendly movie viewings and there are several other activity postings to be found there as well.
I'm happy to have moved to this area of Madison so I can visit this branch often and always get a smile from the staff behind the desk.

Good children's events but library staff are sometimes very rude and have a bad attitude.
A few of them seem to really not like children and have given me and my kids dirty looks.
Why do they have kids' events if they are going to make the parents feel bad...I don't get it.
Also, Alice Oakey the branch supervisor, doesn't really seem to care about these issues or teaching her staff about good customer skills, inclusiveness, and respect.
I am very disappointed.
