Office is pleasant and organized.
Great experience with new doc - Dr. Joshua Millstein.
He took the time to listen and explain things.

Over the previous 2 years my wife has gone to see Dr. Shucker three times for abdominal discomfort.
As she is over 50 she felt it was prudent to request a colonoscopy.
He agreed and said they would contact her...nothing was done.
Instead he scheduled her for what turned out to be an unnecessary mammogram at, you guessed it, a JCL facility.
Finally they responded after 3 requests.
They found advanced stage colon cancer.
She went back to him and reported the finding.
What does his staff do?
Schedule her for ANOTHER mammogram.
This guy will be lucky if we don't sue him out of existence.

Dr. Joshua Millstein is AMAZING!
He is a wonderful doctor and a kind man.
He is the kind of doctor that legitimately cares.
If you want a great doctor he is the one!
