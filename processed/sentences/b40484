Excellent service, bread was hot and fresh, pizza cooked to perfection and price was very reasonable

I ordinarily don't go to Vegas to eat at restaurants that I can eat at home but my first day in Vegas and I was just looking for some quick reasonably priced lunch before I went shopping so I settled for here.
I came right as it opened and there was already a line forming to get inside.
The seated everyone pretty quick though and had more than enough staff to accommodate everyone.
I ordered the calamari and it was good.
Ive had it before so I knew what to expect.
My server was excellent.
She was attentive the whole time and I always had what I needed.
I was looking forward to enjoying their s'mores galore cheesecake but was very disappointed that they ran out.
I wold think that at the beginning of the day they would have all flavors available so that was annoying.
I opted for the white chocolate raspberry and I was not impressed.
I expected to be better than it was so that was a bust.
I did not spend a lot of time there.
I just kind of got in and got out kind of thing so there is nothing else to really review.
It was a pretty basic visit.
Honestly I highly doubt that I would go back because there are better places to eat in Vegas that I don't have access to at home.

Heerlijk gegeten weer hier.
