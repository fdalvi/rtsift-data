Well here we are again visiting another lovely chain restaurant.
I like to eat at subway when it is done right.
This location is very clean, so is the staff if you know what I mean.
They are friendly and courteous quick too.
The ingredients at this location are very fresh, I cannot say the same for some of the other locations.
I will give this one the thumbs up go ahead eat fresh lol!

Love Subway.

Four stars really?
it is fast food thousands of the same all over the country.
yes they make a quick decent sandwich but I wont give it four stars..
I wont go into detail on all the different sandwiches I have tried there I think 99% of the population knows what it tastes like already.
good for a quick cheap meal but not 4 star good..

this place gets FULL.
but they work fast and they're friendly.
