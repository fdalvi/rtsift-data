I remember going here in High School... was a great first place to learn about being gay... friendly people... and in the heart of the Fruit Loop (well, the bookstore, and three bars/ clubs that make up the hub of gay life in Las Vegas... which I still probably make one pilgrimage to once a year when Im home for the holidays... good stuff).

Kicking off Mediocre Monday is Get Booked!
Woooooooo!
We were looking for the "Fruit Loop" which we thought was a gay bar and we ended up here.
It was here we found out that the Fruit Loop is the area that this place and a couple of other gay establishments is in.
Get Booked is a small store with LGBT stuff - from books to decor to novelty items to porn.
Apparently the name Get Booked comes from an incident between the owner and the cops!
We learned this from a really cool employee.
We got to meet the store's weird, slightly rude owner who told us that The Buffalo next door was a cool bar.
He said, "tell them blah blah blah sent you" and they will hook you up.
So I went to The Buffalo and told the bartender that blah blah blah sent me and I got a free cocktail!
