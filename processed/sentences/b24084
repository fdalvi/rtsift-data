While I've used Complete before, I felt compelled to write a review following my recent experience.
I have a Toyota FJ Cruiser, and have been waiting for the day that the windshield finally cracks from being so vertical.
Well, last week was the week!
I called Complete and spoke to Dean, who I've used in the past for chip and crack repair.
Within a few short days I got a call back from Jason, the owner, they had the replacement glass in and I'm on the road like new!
They handled 100% of the insurance papers and everything!
Highly recommend this team!

Very impressed with Complete Auto Glass!
I had a chip in my front windshield from a recent trip and Jason did a fantastic job fixing the problem.
The cost of the service was VERY reasonable.
So I didn't have to contact insurance to make a claim.
I called at about 8:30AM and Jason came to my house by 11:30AM.
He came to my house at no additional charge.
And he was very courteous and professional.
Great job!
