I love this store and I love this location!
I shop during the week so it's never busy when I shop.
And I like the personal attention I get from the staff.
Love love love the sales!!
Especially the scented candles and wallflowers.
I admit it, I spent a bunch a money.
But I know it all gets used and our home smells lovely!

Great central location for the East Valley, but heavy sales tactics.
Also, asked to have my gift items wrapped - even bought a gift bag.
All the clerk did was put the items IN the gift bag.
I could have done that!
Over the top customer service would have been great, and would have balanced out the pushy sales clerk.
Ah well, at least I like the gifts I chose.
