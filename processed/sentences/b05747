This place is hoppin' at lunch time during the week.
If you can make it before noon, you can avoid a long line.
I must say the sandwich was good.
I got the Baja Chicken, which never disappoints.
We just beat the crowd, but after that the crowd was large, the line was long and the A/C wasn't doing much to cool the place down.
It was hot and muggy.
The iced tea was fresh, which in my book is big.
I like fresh brewed tea, but often times find it not fresh.
Kudos for that.
I'll go back, but it will probably wait until the weather cools, or they start chillin'.
I was a little disappointed that an employee was promoting his side business while working in Quizno's attire.
Not sure if the manager knew or not.
He looked like he might've been trying to do it on the sly.
Nice guy, though.
Friendly atmosphere and good food.
Just too hot without the A/C.
