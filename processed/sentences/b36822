This branch is one of the only two in Las Vegas that can give you a checkcard on the spot.
My wallet got stolen last night (for the 3rd time this year) and I did NOT want to wait for it in the mail.
I zipped over during my lunch break.
The banker was super sympathetic and helped me get a card right then and there.
Helped ease my stress a TON.
I love Chase!

No they can't produce debit cards if they don't plan and don't have spare supplies to make the cards.

I was over at Chase Bank the other day along with my mom to open a new checking account.
We met Mr.Â Garrett Truman, personal banker at Chase Bank, and he graciously assisted and explained the various accounts and walked her through all steps necessary, explaining various options and safety measures to protect the account.
He was meticulous and very patient in answering her many questions.
They certainly have many safety features (22) you can choose from to bank online via your cell phone.
Also, we were so impressed with their automatic teller machines where, without a teller, you can deposit and withdraw from your account at the teller area in the bank.
I recommend Chase Bank to everyone.
