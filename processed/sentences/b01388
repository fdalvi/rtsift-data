Love the Blizards!
BUT, when my daughter ordered her chocolate Sunday the guy asked if she wanted whip cream on it or not and she said yes.
After I paid my husband asked me if we had to pay extra for the whip cream and I said surely not!
I walked over there to look at my reciept hanging off the register along with 5-6 others that were never given to those customers and I couldn't read it upsidown.
So I asked the guy and he said, "Oh yea, it was an extra .35 cents.
"  OK, it's just .35 cents, but it really does aggrivate me!
You asked a "Kid?
" Come on...I can totally agree with 35 cents or more for added guacamoli since avacado's are 1.00 each and they might have 1-2 avacado's in your side, but 35 cents for something that should be on a Sunday anyway?
These things costabout .79 cents a can and they can probably get 10 Sunday's out of it.
At least McDonalds doesn't charge yme when I ask for whip cream!

Never coming back here again!
Got charged 167 dollars for a meal that was 16 dollars.
Had to call the bank since my account got overdrawn and didn't even get an apology.
I used to come here all the time but they definitely lost my business for good.

Getting charged for ranch when it comes with your meal is ridiculous.
Who orders chicken strip dry?
Also the people there are rude.

Wow I am shocked that this DQ has such bad reviews!
Every single time I've been to this location the kids that work there have been great!
I mean not just nice but above and beyond.
Also, I don't know why or how but they have better ice cream than the one up on Bell Rd.
