I went here to get realigned a couple of months ago.
The staff was very nice and my actual appointment went quite well.
When it came time to reschedule for a follow up appointment, I was thoroughly disappointed.
I scheduled the second appointment the day I went in to see them.
Days later, I received an email asking to reschedule because the doctor was out sick.
No big deal, I replied to the email to set another time.
A little after that, I got a phone call confirming my appointment for the time I was just asked to reschedule.
I called the office and the person who answered seemed baffled.
This exact thing happened again with my second rescheduled appointment.
After that experience, I had a lack of confidence in the office and have not gone back.

Friendly staff and I would recommend Dr. Ormand to anyone looking for Chiropractic services in the Green Valley area.

I wish zero stars was an option.
I scheduled massage several weeks prior to my appointment.
I left work early and drove across town for a much needed massage to find out an "important client" scheduled at the same time.
They didn't even bother to call and let me know before I wasted my time and gas to find out for myself.
Very very unprofessional and if I was you would avoid this place completely.
