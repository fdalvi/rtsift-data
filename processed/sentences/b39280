A good, if rather expensive, Express by Holiday Inn not far from the centre of Edinburgh.
Rooms are as usual clean, comfortable and reasonably well equipped.
The building has had the original façade retained, whilst the inside has been thoroughly modernised.
On the opposite side of the road there is the Edinburgh Playhouse, a cinema and bar complex with an (expensive) multi-story car park and the St James shopping centre http://www.stjamesshopping.com is nearby.
Princess Street and High Street are both a short walk away.
Room rates can be dear at up to £199, and there is very limited cheap parking, but otherwise recommended.

Ok for hotel, rooms are ok, bathroom is ok, breakfast is fine.
Friendly service.
Nice building from the outside.
But nothing too special.
