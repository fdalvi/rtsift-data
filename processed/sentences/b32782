I could not have imagined anything better.
I just relocated to AZ and sent an email request for a custom cake with less than 48 hours notice.
I was amazed with what Jennifer had created but even more so it was the BEST cake  I have ever had!
The entire family was in heaven.
I'm not a cake person however I loved it so much I had a piece for breakfast the next day!
You will NOT be disappointed.

I found Cake Frenzy through an service listing on Craigslist while looking for someone to create our wedding cake/cupcakes.
Not only were we on a tight budget we only had about 2 1/2 months to plan for the venue we wanted only had a few dates available.
I met Jennifer about a month prior, my fiance' and I knew we wanted a peanut butter & jelly cake and she happily obliged.
I emailed her a picture of what I wanted and the day of our wedding when I first saw our cake I almost cried.
She went above and beyond my expectations.
The cake was beautiful with sugar flowers and gelatin butterflies.
All of our guests loved the flavor combinations and the decorations.
I highly recommend Cake Frenzy, she is professional, she takes pride in her work and extremely reasonable.

I can not believe the my cake.
It was perfect.
all the way down to the last detail.
the cake flavor and filling was perfect.
I have never ordered a custom cake before so was a bit nervous on spending the money.
But i will be ordering again.
Thank you Cake frenzy my friends are still talking about my cake

Best cupcakes I have EVER tasted.
Got two dozen ladybug/daisy cupcakes for my daughter's birthday they were so cute and amazingly delish!
Ordering for all of my next parties for my kids!

Weeks I searched for a place to do my sister's surprise baby sprinkle cake, I took my chances with Cake Frenzy.. it was beyond great, looked beautiful, tasted amazing.
I've never had a custom cake done before and had no clue what to expect, definitely set the bar high.
Will 200% use again.
Thanks Jennifer, your patience and wonderful cake skills were appreciated by everyone!
Amazing, amazing, amazing..
If you are not sure who to use like I was, I recommend Cake Frenzy.
I had no clue in what I was doing, changed how I wanted the cake to look probably about 5 times and she (Jennifer) was a big help.
Thanks a million!

Jennifer made a beautiful cake for my husband's birthday.
Not only was it decorated perfectly, the cakes tasted so yummy!
One tier was a red velvet w/cream cheese filling and the cream cheese was so good; the other was a chocolate w/caramel filling and it was the gooey kind of carmel and fabulous!
Worth every penny!

I initially wanted to try this place in regards to the wonderful yelp reviews.
Unfortunately I did not even get to try the cake I ordered.
I first wrote on the website asking for a cake and I never got a reply.
Then I called numerous times and still nothing.
I finally got a response when I emailed her directly and it was still a few days.
We emailed back and forth for a week and she said she would have the cake ready in time.
( This Wednesday).
Then today she emails me again and said she will in fact NOT have the cake ready.
So I am now stuck with no cake.
I know this is a home-based cake shop but I wish she was a little more professional.
I would not have had a problem if she would have let me know at the beginning she could not get the cake ready.
She did offer me 10% but I will never try her again.
