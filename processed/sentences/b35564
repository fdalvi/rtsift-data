We have several pieces from the Land of Ahhs in our home and every time I walk in I see something that I can easily use to accessorize without breaking the bank.
I love this store!

Popped in on the way to Bed, Bath & Beyond and I'm so glad I did!
This is a cute place.
Cute does not mean small.
The space seemed to go on and on!
If you're in the need for furniture - any kind of furniture - the Land of Ahhs Consignments offers quite a bit.
Couches, bedroom sets, tables, chairs, artwork, you name it I saw a smattering of it here.
Items appeared almost new and smelled freshly cleaned.
Alas, I struck out.
I was looking for something on the smaller side to fit my corner dining area.
However, I was told the inventory is regularly refreshed by the (incredibly upbeat and) helpful staff.
If this gem was in my neck of the woods I'd pop in *all* the time!
This is a definite recommend!

I am naturally attracted to the words "consignment" and "thrift store.
"  As soon as my eyes laid on the Land of Ahhs Consignment, my feet automatically sped up towards the door.
I liked everything I saw.
It's not called the Land of Ahhs for nothing.
The items in there are a cross between classy and eccentric.
But nonetheless most of the items are made for great conversation pieces for your home.
I didn't buy anything cause some of the prices were a bit steep for my pocketbook but, man, I know I will be back for something special.
