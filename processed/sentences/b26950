Went in looking for new running shoes.
I was promptly greeted by an employee who was already with a couple so I walked toward the back where there were two employees talking.
One walked out, I told him I was looking for new running shoes.
He told me I was in the wrong section (I was in the kid's section because I was looking for help...).
He sang a song about how I needed to move forward, then started talking to the other customer about how cold it was.
I stood looking at nothing, waiting for this person to direct me toward a good pair of running shoes.
Two minutes later with no help, we left with no goodbye.
I hope that guy doesn't live on commission because he's probably starving.
Epic fail in customer service.

Don't you dare wait for Jordans here!
I just left this morning at 9:45 and the employees are super shady.
We got there at 7:00am and there were 8 people ahead of us.
All of us in line talked about our sizes.
So we were the first people in line with 9.5 as a request.
Only 6 people ended up getting shoes, none with our size and they claimed after 6 people that they were out of any size over 9.
The math doesn't make sense when it was well discussed among the people in line which sizes were bought.
There was another guy in line who worked at the Boulevard Finish Line who also confirmed that the math didnt add up.
Shady.
I hope corporate sees this and puts these employees at this location on check.
If you have employees in line from another store waiting, so should you!
Completely unethical.

Came in here to just look around.
I saw that NCAA hoodies were on sale 2 for $35.
I bought some.
(Go Rebels!
) The employees were nice and attentive, even offering to help us get sizes from the back without us having to ask.
I have not purchased shoes here, but I recommend this store and would go here again.
Note, they have a rewards card.
I'm not sure about the benefits, inquire in-store.

love this store
