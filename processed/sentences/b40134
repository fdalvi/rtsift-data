This place is mediocre but Downtown, it's the perfect little spot to grab a treat and people watch!
The set up is your normal fro-yo type of place.
Lots of flavors, that you can sample.
The toppings bar is generous.
The night I went in, there was one girl basically just sitting there reading a magazine, but it's not like you really need a lot of service.
They are open until 11 pm which is great if you are Downtown for late dinner or movie!
Cute new place, I hope it stays for a while.

Many wonderful flavors,  a lot of toppings and a clean place :) idk how much for an ounce,  but I paid under five dollars.
Get what you want and go on a stroll down town and call it a night :)

A light lunch, some free time on your hands, beautiful weather - time for a FroYo!
I don't get here often but I always enjoy it when I do.
They have an amazing selection of frozen yogurts and more toppings than I can name.
The staff is friendly and more than willing to let you sample something before you put it in your cup.
One thing that will strike you is how clean this place is.
I mean it's ICU clean.
I need to come by more often.

I was killing sometime  before I caught my airplane back to LA and stopped by this great yogurt shop.
It's in a great location and has nice outdoor seating.
I recommend getting the cake batter and red valvet flavors, very delicious
