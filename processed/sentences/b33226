Do not buy a car here.
I did, I have made my payments and for months I have called to find out when my car would be paid off.
Today I got a surprise that I owed almost $400 more because of a couple payments made 1 or 2 days late.
When I asked if there were any fees associated, the answer was no.
However it was never disclosed it would affect how they applied the payment towards the principle.
Only unethical companies do not fully disclose the terms.
So yes let me make this clear my issue is with the finance company.
CHAPMAN's in house finance company.
The one that operates on the same premises as this dealership.
The one that is part of the Chapman business.
Due to an employee not being fully trained on how to disclose information we had this situation.
If you want to buy or have a car serviced by a company who does not show they invest in employee training and development you should do business with these people.
If you want to do business with a company who would rather worry about making 1.4% more profit than creating a culture of customer care do your business here.
My issue may be with the finance part of this company, but it truly speaks to Chapman's overall business ethos.

TERRIBLE!
I would give this place 0 stars if I could!!
The maintenance place is ridiculous!
They told us they needed to install a little part & we would be there for 25-35 min MAX!
Over an hour later we asked about our car & were told it would be another 35-40 min because it was "complicated" it wasn't only the fact that we were going to be sitting there for 2 hours it was the fact that the guy working in the office at the desk was extremely rude!
Never in my life will be back to this location.
Sorry excuse for customer service.. Be smart & go somewhere else!
