High quality food at more than reasonable prices.
Makes me look forward to eating lunch again!
Roasted veggie salad is ridiculously good and filling.

Came into town for some business and they ordered Brown Bag for the meeting.
It may be called Brown Bag, but it was the food was more like something I would find at a nice sit down on the strip.
In fact, it was better than the place we ended up going to that night.
Definitely took me by surprise.
Considering that most of the items we got were on the healthier side, it was amazing that the flavors were as good as they were.
My favorite was the cold sesame noodle salad, but it was all tasty.
The miserable hot weather make me not look forward to going into Vegas for business, but if they feed me like this every time, than maybe it won't be so bad.

I love Brown Bag!
As a busy professional with type 1 diabetes, I really need to look after myself and my diet.
It's easy to skip lunch but Brown Bag saves my life daily.
I look forward to trying the weekly specials - everything is always so delicious.
Very reasonable pricing, healthy options...it really is a no brainer.
You won't be disappointed!

I was fortunate enough to find brown bag lunches on a whim!
I found myself in a bit of a pickle when the caterer I was using, who will remain unnamed totally screwed me over.
I was referred to Lisa (the owner) who reassured me she would be able to handle everything!
Keep in mind this was a large event with multiple dietary restrictions with only 2 days notice.
Fast forward to the day of the event, she showed up on time, Ã¼ber professional and friendly.
Everyone was raving about the food and service!
I will be using Lisa at brown bag lunches for all of my catering needs!
And don't let the name fool you, this girl is a culinary master and trained at Le Cordon bleu!
