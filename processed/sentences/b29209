Disclaimer: owner is my brother-in-law, but I am also a paying customer who used Firehouse Moving's services recently.
My wife and I moved across town several months ago and used Firehouse Moving's services to do so.
My wife was eight months pregnant at the time, so we needed more help than we typically would.
Firehouse was very helpful, professional, and fast.
They had our large furniture wrapped, down the stairs, and out the door quickly and safely.
They had the garage empty of boxes shortly after that.
On the other end, unloading the truck happened as quickly and efficiently, including moving some heavy furniture up a semi-narrow winding staircase.
My experience with Firehouse Moving was great, and I definitely recommend their services.
They are professional, friendly, and quick.
Their prices are very reasonable and without hidden costs.
Most importantly, they made what could have been a huge task (moving with a pregnant wife) much much easier.

This was our fourth move and the first one totally free of stress.
Dusty and his helper showed up on time.
They were efficient, professional and helpful.
They shrink wrapped everything and nothing came damaged.
I would certainly recommend Firehouse Movers.
