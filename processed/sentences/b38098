If you are like who need to see a doctor last minute, but do not want to give up the knowledge and high quality by going to just any urgent care, Designed for Life Primary Care is for you.
Denise Murray is very professional and knowledgeable.
She has become our family's PRN for the last few months.
We have been very pleased with the service and personalize attention she has given us.
She does not rush you and is always on time.
Designed For Life Primary Care doesn't make you wait for an hour past your appointment time just to spend 10 minutes or less with you like most doctor offices do.

While my mom was visiting from out of town she had a health issue and we came to see Denise.
She was professional, caring and knowledgeable and quickly put my elderly mom at ease.
I really appreciate how much time Denise spent explaining issues to us and how thorough she is.
The follow up phone call was much appreciated also.
I don't think my mom has ever received such compassionate care before!

If you a looking for a doctor who really takes the time to research and talk to you about your medical needs, Denise Murray is the one for you.
She's extremely professional and knowledgeable.
She asks questions to delve into your lifestyle habits and goes beyond the basics - because not everyone is the same.
She also goes above and beyond to try to find ways to make tests as inexpensive as possible by recommending a variety of labs and solutions.
I highly recommend her for anyone looking for a medical professional.
