I was visting family in Mesa last weekend & needed a haircut bad!
Found Tony's Barbershop while driving by.
Tony seemed like a very nice guy he did a excellent job on my cut.
Im not from the area and my brother in-law said id be spending about $20 on a cut around town,  I was shocked Tony only charged $12.
I normally dont write online reviews but this shop deserves it.
Thanks again for the awesome cut guys!

This is the only Barber shop I will be going to from now on.
I live in Gilbert and I'm still making the drive to have Tony cut my hair and trim my beard.
I have Tony cut my 6 year old son's hair and it's the best cut the little guy can get anywhere.
Much better than the franchise places.
Other pros:   * Great Prices * Great Hours * Tony is an experience barber and really takes his time with everything he does.
* His wife cuts hair upon request and special appointment but my wife says she is phenomenal....you'll have to ask Tony how to get one of the appointments.
* Great Barbershop conversation.

Had my first haircut at Tony's today.
Great job!
Tony is very professional and courteous.
Very good price too.
Had a great conversation during the whole process.
I highly recommend this place for your next haircut.
:-)
