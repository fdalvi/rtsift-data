The room was very clean and the staff was very nice.
Went to the restaurant because we were told we got a discount for staying at the hotel.
The food was ok but very overpriced.

This was the worst place I have ever stayed.
I felt like I was in a motel six.
A bug in my bed , couch was mixed match cushion, not very clean.
Gross

Front desk is very friendly.
We had complimentary wifi for being a westgate owner but the downfall is only being able to connect to one device at a time.
The units had two large jetted garden tub but you can only fill it 1/4 of the way before the hot water is completely gone.
I was told it's because they use a 25 gallon water heater for the two units which is crazy!
Very grateful to have a washer and dryer unit although it's very small in capacity so one load = half a load.
Kitchen was completely stocked!
