I have been going to Premier Auto Collision for several years now.
I have 3 vehicles and have had major to minor work done and will not go anyplace else.
Keith, the owner, is truly honest and this shop does excellent work.
They are fast, reliable, and very reasonable.
They do body work and/or any engine repair.
It seems they can do it all!!
If you want it done right for a fair price, this is the place to go!!

Although the name is Premier Auto Body, Keith's shop can fix just about any problem you have with your car.
I have 3 vehicles that I have been taking here for several years now.
From minor to major work, Keith has kept my cars running great and his prices are very reasonable.
Being a woman, I was used to mechanics taking advantage of my lack of knowledge regarding auto repair.
Keith has been honest, his prices the best and he gets me in and out quickly.
I won't go anywhere else!!!

Many thanks to Premier Auto Body for doing a pre-purchase body and frame inspection on a car I was buying.
Keith took valuable time out of his schedule, on a Saturday, and inspected the used car I was buying.
After having the car on the lift and carefully looking at the undercarriage and all the body panels, he advised me that the car looked very clean.
Carfax can't do what Keith was able to do, as cars can be wrecked and never reported to Carfax.
His inspection was worth gold in my book, but he charged nothing.
I can't say enough how thankful I am, so I'll just say thanks very much for the great service.

I needed body work on my car, and took it to Keith.
He was the least expensive, and the most thorough in doing the estimate.
The work was excellent, and I was able to rent a car through him and Hertz at a discount.
All I can say is, better price, less time, and great job.
I will always take my cars to him for repair and maintenance.
