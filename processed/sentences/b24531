Had my first Charley's meal.
Went with the Philly Steak grilled sub with the mushrooms, onion and bell pepper.
Never saw the mushrooms I ordered and paid extra for!
Even though I asked the cook if he had added them.
Also had the bacon cheese fries.
I've had much better cheese fries.So I'm a little disappointed.
But the place was alright over all.
They have a great menu so I'm going to say A-ok for now.
'll try them again at some point since I got a punch card and its near where I often shop and my friends kids like the place.

The menu here is a bunch of creative sandwiches, all done up on a flat-top, Philly style.
They use fresh ingredients and the bread is really tasty.
I don't eat fries much, but theirs are not too greasy.
The place is always filthy, so I'll take them down a star.

Man, I really like Charleys.
I know it is in the mall, but the location outside of the mall was where I used to go in a couple times a month.
Sometimes, I think about going to PV Mall and planning it around lunch.
The fries are crispy, hot and fresh!
I ask them to mix me up 1/2 ranch 1/2 BBQ sauce.
Stir it up real well and dip the fries in it.
Whoo baby, that is GOOD stuff.

The blueberry lemonade was refreshing, but did not enjoy sucking fruit through a straw.
:)  They also made the wrong sandwich.
I ordered a buffalo and got a buffalo sauce free sandwich.
