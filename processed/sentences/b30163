I recently gave MK Nova a try since they are right by my work.
I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the owner cut my hair and she is so sweet!
I met another gal that works there also and they are great to talk to.
The enviroment is welcoming and relaxing.
My hair cut came out great (and im super picky!
) They also do basic waxing & color.
I wish it was time for another hair cut so i had a reason to go just sit and chat hehe!
But all in all I would definately recommend giving them a try and the prices are good.

I recently went back to have another hair cut(decided to try bang :)) She helped me decide what would look best for the part and the side to have them on.
I really enjoy coming here because they give you advice, are nice to talk to, and always try to help.
Thanks!!

I visited Arizona for vacation this summer and I came to MK Nova Salon to get a hair cut.
I loved the staff that works there, they are very friendly and professional.
I received the best hair cut ever.
The owner of the salon is very friendly and nice.
She brought be a cup of coffee and kept me entertained.
When you go to the salon, you will receive the best service and they are very professional.

Best prices and best haircuts!
I have had two haircuts here and am going back for a third very soon.
I get compliments on my haircuts from Marina everywhere I go!

Nice lady who gives an okay cut for a decent price.
A great place to go in a pinch for sure.
If you are female and have a cut like a Bob--a straight cut in other words--she would do a great job for you I could tell.
Or if you are looking for someone to do your bangs try her for sure.
My guess is she is probably good with men's hair, too.
Warning:   Don't expect this gal to layer your hair right.
And she has a tendency to get scissor-happy as I ended up losing about 3" off the back of my hair, which means I have to grow it out again.
Not happy about that for sure.

Love this place, great price and haircuts done.
Always come here to get my hair done.

Went for a kids haircut, sign says 11.00 dollars, the non smiling, unfriendly lady that cut my grandsons hair say 14.00 after all was done and said, I told her the signs say 11.00 dollars, she says that's the sign for outside, inside say 14.00 wth????
I told her that's false advertising!!!
She was not a very pleasant person , my grandson tells me after shes done that the clippers really hurt him....never will we go there again!!!
