Easy to miss this place while rolling down McDowell.
This hole in the wall specializing in homey (and halal) Somali food appeared to be a 2-person operation on my visit, with the proprietor running the register, serving, and putting out food on the small steam table where he was keeping the day's featured dishes and a woman in the kitchen taking care of plating other food and dishwashing.
At first, you have to dig into the menu to find the Somali/Mediterranean options as most of the real estate is devoted to lunch specials and plates aimed at mainstream American tastes (burgers, cheese steak sandwiches, fried fish, wings, etc).
My $10 plate lunch of cubed/chopped mildly seasoned, roasted goat shoulder and tasty rice came with a little bit of green salad, a small portion of deliciously tangy pinto beans, a small cup of fine chopped jalapenos and onion ("hot sauce"), and a good sized bowl of rich vegetable (though, likely not vegetarian) soup.
I washed it all down with an agua fresca-like mango drink without the teeth-aching sweetness so often found in the Mexican fruit waters.
As I was finishing up my meal, a small crowd of African (Somali?
) cab drivers descended on the place--almost all of whom had a salmon, rice, and salad plate, which was served and eaten with a fresh banana.
Some of the guys appeared to be regulars who felt very much at home there.
Great testament to the owner's hospitality.
On my way out, I chatted a bit with the proprietor about the day's offerings, and he indicated that he has plans to add more items to the menu and vary the offerings from day to day.
I hope this means that eventually the Somali/East African items will take center stage.

A few weeks ago while driving around i noticed a few people walking into this hole in the wall type of place, didnt think much of it at the time but every time i drove by after that my curiosity kept making me wanting to find what this place was all about.
Last night was the night in which i hadnt even finished my plate of delicious grilled goat with rice, steamed cabagge and spinach with some black beans in which i was already planning my next meal here.
To tell you the truth the service was a little slow, the original menu item i wanted wasnt available (the chief cook had the night off) and they offered me and my friend the grilled goat and the marinated chicken.
By the end of my meal i was thankful i had the goat....it was beyond amazing!
I must say that i am ready to try more Somalian dishes.....im sold on it!
Next time im trying the kabobs with the yellow rice.

Excellent food, friendly staff.
Salmon was wonderful, incredible rice and interesting salad dressing.
