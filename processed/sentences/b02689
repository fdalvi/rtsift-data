Great place.
Home of the cherry limeade.
So delicious.
And they even have happy hour.
There are only a few that use roller skates, but haven't seen too many of the staff here on them.
Quick and efficient with drive-thru and drive up.

Always love coming here , its a real treat ..
Lemon berry slush and jumbo popcorn chicken yum !!
And catch them in happy hour for AWESOME deals
