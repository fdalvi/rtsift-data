Great job Preety threading

I have the best experience ever about my eyebrows.
They are so nicely ..
I didn't even feel that somebody shaped them with thread .. She was perfect and smooth doing my eyebrows and suggested me what looks better on me.
I will recommend all my friend list and families to Preety threading

I live 1 hour away from this place i gladly drive 1 hour for an 8$ thread.
Because it is so worth it.
Reeta does it perfect!
I have never gotten a better brow job than here.
