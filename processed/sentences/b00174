@holverson: SCREW YOU Valvoline Instant Oil Change!
I schedule a 3 hr appt.
& you close without canceling.
Make me drive 1 hr w/kids.
You suck!!
#FAIL

Pulled in the other day for a standard oil change.
Both bays were full, yet the staff came out and explained to me the wait.
No prob.
When it went even longer due to a added service by one of the vehicles in the bay, they got right out and let me know.
Again, no prob.
Appreciate it.
Then, they began to in process me before I got in the garage and started a light check.
They were on it.
After looking at the dipstick, the lead tech explained to me that I did not need an oil change and showed me the oil.
It was still in good condition and since I was at 3k miles, it REALLY wasn't needed.
My choice, but the advice was not to worry about  it.
Their prompt communications, attention and honesty is a rare find in today's service world.
I will be back for sure....and post this to yelp.
Jan 2013-Went back a couple months ago.
Same thing.
Repeated, honest service.
Very nice!

Friendly staff, quick oil change.
As with any place they're suggest a new air filter, etc.
(You can buy an air filter for $5 or $10, and installing it yourself is as difficult as making microwave popcorn.
) No complaints.

The staff here were very courteous and knowledgeable!
I felt like I could really trust them.
The service was quick and completely worth it.
I'll come here every time!
