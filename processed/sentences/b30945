The Snyder group has been a pleasure to work with!
Mike Stone helped us find our home in 5 days.
He knew exactly what we were looking for and out did himself.I will definitely Recommend the Snyder group  to my friends.Terry Patton also was very helpful in getting out stuff together.
Can't wait for the House warming party ;-).
We are love our new house!

I have been working with Dale and the Snyder Group for many years.
He has helped us on numerous purchases and sales of properties.
He is very trustworthy and will tell you the truth about the market.
He also keeps me updated on the changes in the market and is always one step ahead of the others.
He has a great passion for his career and it really shows in his work.
I would recommend him to anyone looking for an honest, hardworking Realtor in Las Vegas!

I used the Snyder Group to help us find a place to rent until we could afford something to buy when we first moved into the Las Vegas area.
The experience went great and we're now using them again to find a place to buy.
These real estate agents really know what they're doing and are great help every step of the way.
They saw potential problems we wouldn't have found on our own and were always available to talk when we needed to.
I could not recommend them more!

Rhonda at The Snyder Group is a five star realtor.
She is on top of everything and I am happy she was able to help me find my first home.
She always reached out when I needed her and she is a very honest person, believe me I had 3 realtors before in the area and none of them cant compared like Rhonda.
She is the best, I would highly recommend her!
