Brand new sub place from the same owner of Fat Boy's Pizza.
Ordered a Turkey, Salami, and Cheese sandwich - it came on a fresh and fluffy toasted roll.
The meat was fresh and high quality.
I got it to go, but ended up wolfing it down in the car on my way home.
It was really good.
I usually just get a basic meat + cheese + bread sort of sandwich, but they do offer lots of goodies for free with your sub.
I would have gotten avocado, but they had just recently opened and hadn't gotten any yet.
The prices are really low here, the menu is simple, and it's quick.
Even better - they deliver in the area (pretty far too).
If I lived closer, I would definitely eat here all the time.
My last office job had me commuting and I would pick up a sandwich from a place just like this every day on my way to work.
Any time I can buy local over eating at a mega chain like Subway or Jimmy Johns, I'll do it.
This place is probably cheaper, and you definitely get more (and higher quality) food for your buck.

Worst sub I've ever had.
I ordered the salami and cheese.
They don't ask you what you want on it- they just make it.
It was covered in some type of dressing and there was a ton of mayonnaise.
I couldn't even eat it- I ate the meat and that was it.
They don't use a toaster oven, either- they have a microwave.
It's a sketchy joint.
And the add-ons are not free like this other review leads you to believe- they are 75 cents each.
Won't be going back here.

My daughter and son-in-law went here and told us we had to try them,  that they had the best subs.
My husband and I tried their Italian sub and pastrami sub and they were just as good as my daughter said.
The bread was fresh and the sub was stacked to overflowing.
The staff is very friendly and helpful.
We will definitely return frequently.

I gave this place another go because a friend bought it for me.
Got the Italian.
Made sure there was no dressing or mayonnaise.
Still wasn't great.
