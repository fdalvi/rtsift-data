Outdated look, slow service, half star for gud customer service...
I think ud get ur food faster going thru drive thru, which ill happily take next time I come here :)

I love this location.
The staff is always awesome and super friendly, especially at night :)  Out of the Taco Bell's I've been to in Phoenix, this is definitely my favorite for that very reason.

horrible service, in the drive thru the girl spills soda on me and instead of saying she is SORRY she says WELL HOW WAS I TO KNOW THERE WAS SODA ON THE LID?
then she just walks off, doesn't offer me a napkin or say anything else, just left it for someone else to address...  NEVER AGAIN!
