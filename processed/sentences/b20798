Trespass is located in Ocean Terminal and is great for all your outdoor needs from camping gear, waterproof jackets to walking boots.
As soon as you walk in you will see the wall almost completely dedicated to hardcore footwear.
This isn't the largest branch of Trespass I've ever seen but if it's outdoor getup you're looking for they have a pretty extensive range and the staff are helpful and knowledgeable too.

In the last couple of years, train journeys to Oban past the rolling countryside, plus a fishing trip last summer, have combined to give me a new-found interest in the great Scottish outdoors.
I'm determined to walk the West Highland Way before too long, though realistically it's looking like next summer before I'll get a chance to do it.
When I do strap a pair and take the trip though, Trespass will likely be my first stop for camping stoves, a tent, and a nice pair of hiking boots.
They have pretty much everything you'll need to survive a short trip to the wild.

Ocean Terminal really is a one-stop shop.
It has everything!!
Including Trespass.
they are all things outdoor.
Tents, backpacks, hiking boots, jackets, trousers, everything.
The staff are really friendly too, more than happy to help and extremely knowledgeable.
The price is a bit much, but I'm told that this is typical of outdoor places.
