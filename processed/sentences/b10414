Excellent service, items delivered on time.
The initial delivery was two chairs short, but with one phone call, the missing items were delivered promptly and with a smile.
Our guests thought our party decor looked great.
I wouldn't hesitate to use RSVP again.

I rent from them almost monthly, and at times without much notice.
They always have my equipment ready and everyone I have ever dealt with has been extremely nice and helpful.
Love working with them!

RSVP is competitively priced but has poor service.
The first rep I spoke to on the phone was initially nice and helpful, then turned snippy and impatient one minute later when I told her I needed to change the color of my tablecloths.
They were out of several colors, but I still found one I could use.
I rented from them during the week of Thanksgiving, which I'm sure was a bit hectic, so I gave her a pass.
I picked up my chairs, tables and decor at 9:30am.
Nothing was ready when I arrived and it took 35 minutes for them to fill my reservation.
Then I got a phone call two hours later and a woman very rudely told me that unless I came to pick up my items soon, they were going to close.
I said, "Oh, I'm sorry, I picked them--" before she hung up on me.
So happy holidays to you too.

I was looking for a chair rental company for our upcoming wedding and contacted RSVP.
Our wedding venue coordinator also mentioned that she has worked with them in the past, so I decided to give them a call.
I spoke with Lorraine today, and in the span of about 20 minutes she quoted me with a very reasonable price, and has already sent over the contract.
I could not be happier with her service, and this is one less thing I need to worry about.

I was super impressed with RSVP Party Rentals.
We ordered heaters, tables, and linens from them.
I changed my order a couple times and they were prompt and flexible with my requests.
They dropped off the equipment on Friday, which was a huge blessing since that allowed us to set up the day before the wedding.
Very professional.
I highly recommend them.
