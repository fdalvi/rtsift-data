Unbelievable!!!
Ordered food at 19:30 & was told it would arrive in 45mins to an hour.
Called at 20:35 and was told it would be the next order out.
Called again at 20:50 & 21:20 to be told it would be there in minutes each time!
When it eventually arrived AT 21:30, the order was incomplete (no sauce in or with the shredded beef with hot & spicy sauce) and everything was COLD!!
Their excuse?
It's been busy.
So what?!
Even a call to say would have allowed me the option of driving down there myself!
I couldn't anyway but at least giving me an update and the option would have been something.
How did they propose to make amends?
Send the sauce straight away!
After considerable faffing, was offered 20% off my next order.
Like I'll order a delivery again!
I asked for a refund (reasonable given the circumstances) and, when pushed about the temperature of the food, I was told they would send a fresh order straight away & I would get 20% off the NEXT order.
They're REALLY not getting it, eh.
Quite frankly, as bad an experience as I've ever had.
A true measure of a company is how they handle things when they inevitably go wrong.
This says all that needs to be said.
Despicable.
