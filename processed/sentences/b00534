This place is idea for those brave who already have a few bullet wounds.
Maybe some hard core tats too!
went here at 8 at night and was already shaking in my heels.
Ran straight to the bubbly, that was overpriced, and then to the register.
I was greeted openly by a pitbull/bulldog mix.
He smiled at my tender meatiness as I bought the booze.
Left as quick as possible.
If I have any advise for those who actually like the dark side streets of East Phoenix...take the drive through.
Even though I bashed them a bit...they did have like every alcoholic beverage under the moon.
2 stars for that!
Could I suggest a paid officer or...a chain for the dog.. :/

Badass little place.
Every color size and make of alcohol.
Prices are ok and they have a drive thru.
Yes its not on a great part of town but you're not here for the location but for the product.

I used to come here a lot because it is convenient.
Its overpriced as hell, and they have shit selection, but the previous owner (?
) Steve was nice.
They have a variety of stuff, but not a good selection of anything.
Cider and wine selections are ridiculous and the staff doesnt know what they carry, so forget about the drive thru.
Cant think of a reason to go back really.
