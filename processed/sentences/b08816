my review is based solely on sales girl, nikki.
she is AWESOME!
today a girl at work had the most fabulous necklace on and told me she got it at guess (marciano).
I looked online and couldn't find it so I called to see if they could put one on hold for me in the store to pick up later.
well, nikki sold the last one yesterday.
She checked online and was able to find it, she also found two stores that had it in stock and gave me their numbers.
THEN she checked their warehouse and sure enough, they had it.
She ordered it for me and did not charge S&H for 2-day delivery.
so my beloved necklace will be here on Friday.
saaa-weeeet!
i already know what i'm going to wear it with :)  Nikki is a freakin rock star!
I am going to call the store and let them know how awesome she is, too.
How often can you find someone willing to go through all of that just to get you a silly necklace?
Next time you're at Guess ask for Nikki, she will do more than you could even think to ask for.

My preconceived notions of Scottsdale as a place where you have to dress nice to get any service got stopped here at Guess.
Walking in with jeans and old converses, I didn't expect to get much help.
I haven't actually gone shopping in a long time for myself, so with a $400 gift card in tow from Christmas, I was ready to blow it.
Blow it all.
I was like a kid in a toy store.
The sale reps were really helpful and was able to find my sizes and colors.
As trendy as this place can be, it has lots of variety as far as casual dress, party dress, and clothing for almost all seasons.
Love it.

Stephanie is a great sales girl.
She's always very friendly and makes sure to greet everyone who walks in.
I frequent Guess A LOT so it's nice to see she's like that on a consistent basis.
