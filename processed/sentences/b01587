Air Jordan!
need I say more?

When they didn't have my size I asked if they could call the Metro store.
When he was on hold for less the a minute a different customer asked for some help, he hangs up goes to help that person.
When I ask what they said he tells me they didn't answer that he has to help these ppl then he'll call back.
- went to Champs and they were a 10 on service and didn't get the sales person commission feel.
(If you aren't buying I'm not helping)

The staff was friendly and told me where I could go to find what I wanted.
I appreciated the information.

This is now the 3rd pair of shoes I have bought from Finish Line.
Not sure why I never reviewed them before.
They deserve 5 stars.
Eric is the manager I have always dealt with.
He knows what he is talking about and makes it an easy transaction.
No obnoxious up sells or anything.
Highly recommend.
