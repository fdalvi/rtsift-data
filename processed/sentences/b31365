They keep a record of your preferences so they can repeat.
They cut your hair quickly and well.
A bit pricey, but coupons and rewards card help.
They offer free touch-ups after you've had a cut with them (it's not a full cut, but they'll get the fuzz off your neck and tidy up between cuts).

The Sport Clips store in South Gilbert has absolutely littered our whole housing complex with cards - in baggies - with rocks in the baggies - as some sort of cheap advertisement campaign.
The problem is that they have literally placed about 1/3 of these unsightly deposits IN THE STREET in front of the houses.
Another 1/3 are on the curb of the driveway and the other 1/3 are between the curb and the sidewalk.
Not only is this very cheap and ugly but it also a violation of city litter laws and also planning and development solicitation laws.
The advertisement is for Sports Clips 4622 S Higley RD Gilbert AZ 480-840-6880.
This has really riled up the whole sub division and we are filing charges against the establishment and are willing to make this trashy-litter nuisance as public as possible.
I called the establishment twice - morning and afternoon - but the have no owner or manager there to return my calls.

The girls here are all very sweet and they hook you up with a nice cut.
They do a good job of keeping your preferences in the computer so you dont have to repeat your style every three weeks.
The tvs are great and the MVP makes me feel like Im at a man spa!

Been going here for quite a while - since they first opened.
Staff is always very nice and they do a great job.
I always cringe whenever I'm forced to go somewhere else (e.g., if I'm out of town, etc) because I know that I'll get great service here so why jinx it.
