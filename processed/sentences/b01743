Good service.
Free sufficient size samples and not just a spoonful.
The regular size is more than enough!
When I was there, they were out of a lot of flavors though =(

Get the White Chocolate but leave the Strawberries and Cream flavor, too faux-berry/chemical tasting.

With the world of yogurt and yogurt-like joints popping up, It seems that TCBY has been left behind.
It's not bad, per se.. just uninteresting.
Staff a this location were sweet.
