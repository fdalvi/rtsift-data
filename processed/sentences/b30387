Campbell"s Steam Pro is amazing!
Their work is phenomenal.
I was so surprised and impressed with how well they cleaned my carpets.
I've had the carpets clean before by a "eco friendly company" and I wasn't impressed.
Campbell's Steam Pro blows the green team out of the water.
They have reasonable rates without the hassle.
They are professional, reasonable and accommodating.
These guys know what they are taking about and know how to take care of it.
Thanks Campbell Steam Pro!!!!!!!!!

Went on Yelp to find a steam cleaning co and happend on Campbells steam cleaning, i called and left a message for George who called me back the same day (thur.
) and he was able to schedule me the very next day which was awesome.
He was wonderful about scheduling something around my work schedule.
The day of, the cleaner was running a little late so george personally called me to tell me which i greatly apprecuated.
Once Ashton got to my home he got right to work and was very friendly, quick and efficiant!
My search is over, i will use Campbells from here on out.
I even sent an email to all my co-workers who live in the area to call him should they need their carpets cleaned!

Called them up snd he was to busy to talk, said he would call back and never did....
I have alot of carpeting and need to stretch some area, they're loss.
