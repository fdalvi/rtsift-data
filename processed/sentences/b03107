this is the best dentist in the valley.
excellent care and the friendlest office staff..looking for a new dentist you can't go wrong with this one.

Patrick and his team are so wonderful!
I've used many dentists around the US and by far Absolute Dental has been my best dental experience.
Patrick takes the time to pursue perfection, one of my front teeth had cracked and I couldnt afford to get a veneer.
So he created a whole new tooth with just filling material.
The shape, color, and placement of the tooth turned out perfect, you cant even tell its fake.
I would highly recommend his dental services to anyone!

Best Dentist & Staff!
I love Dr. Patrick & Staff.
Wish I wouldn't have moved so far away but won't be changing now.
Responsive, knowledgable, kind, caring,& professional.
Dr. Patrick is up to date & will do whatever he can but also not step outside his wheel-house which is appreciatd since we all have strengths, nice to have someone say when they won't do it all - speciality is appreciated.
I recommend to anyone & everyone especially if your afraid of dentist, you won't be after Dr. Patrick, promise!

I was referred to absolute dental by a coworker and hadn't been to the dentist in two years, so I was nervous!
Since the moment I called to make an appointment to my checkout my experience was great!
Very Clean!!
Sandy, the hygienist and Patrick are awesome and have ready scheduled my sixth month followup!
