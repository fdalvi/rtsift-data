This is the best ham radio store in town!
Everyone there is very helpfull and the prices you can't beat!
If you are a ham and visiting, visit this place!
Not far off the Strip - just the other side of the freeway from the strip.

Excellent prices and selection.
I can't comment too much on the knowledge level of the sales staff as I knew exactly what I wanted to purchase.
However, the sales staff was exceptionally friendly and efficient, which made for an excellent shopping experience.
I highly recommend this store for all of your radio hobby needs.

I like shopping AES and have bought two Yaesu radios from them.
I was in Las Vegas and dropped by the store.
I was hoping to see radios on display to try and get a hands on feel of.
But, a limited selection of radios behind the counter beyond touch and not connected.
So, I'll shop their catalog but pass the in store visit unless I know exactly what I need!
Nice store just no radios to demo.

One reviewer states that this is the best Ham store in town; please tell me the other ones, because I didn't find any others at all.
Radio World in Boulder City is 100x better.
I stopped in and it was all the same ham gear you can get (and research) online.
I didn't see any sale items, or anything that compels me to shop in a brick-and-mortar store.
I've been to the AES in Milwaukee also and that one was a little better.
It's fine, but nothing to write home about.
