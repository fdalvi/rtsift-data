Great selection of shoes from Jordan's to LBJ's better than FootLocker n FinishLine.
Not only great selection but also great customer service

Stay away...
This place charges more than retail.
Nike Free 5.0+ for $99 but Nike.com has the exact shoe for $79.
I will wait and have them shipped.

This is the worst shoe store I have ever been to.
Their return policy is shady and even their corporate customer service is terrible and didn't help.
I bought 3 pairs of converse shoes and since I was traveling I didn't need the boxes.
The manager Timothy never said we cannot return or exchange the shoes without the boxes.
That was on a Monday night.
I tried the shoes at the hotel and they were a little tight.
Tuesday at noon I came back to exchange them for a larger size and the assistant manager was unable to let us exchange the shoes for a larger pair (you guessed it, because we didn't have the boxes, which the manager never said would be an issue in the first place).
Anyways now I'm left with 3 pairs of shoes that I cannot use.
Never coming back here again.
Ps.
Update: the assistant manager Ricardo was very considerate and helped resolve the issue.
