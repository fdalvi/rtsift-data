The grand opening of Riverview Park was excellent.
More to come as hotels and shops are planned.
Super open, clean, and better than before.
The stadium is huge!

This is a really nice park.
Couple jungle gyms that are really neat.
One is really tall with ropes all around it.
The other is like a wave with ropes to climb on.
There is a splash pad with lots of spraying water.
Very nice.
Hope it stays that way.

Very nice looking park so far with the Cubs Spring Training stadium nearby.
Can't wait for more shops and hotels to come in the near future.

This is an awesome park!
It is the best park I think I have ever been to.
The play structures are great and new.
It has a small kids area, and a big kids area.
The big kids area has a zipline, and a tunnel spinner as well as an awesome climbing structure.
The park also has a nice size splash pad to cool off.
The most interesting part of this park is the 50 foot high rope climbing structure!
I was afraid to climb all the way up!
The park is clean and has nice walking paths, a small lake and lots of grass to run in.
The only negative I noticed was that the small children's playground had no shade and the slides were too hot to play on.
Also because it is such a great park it was a bit crowded (though I did go on a Sunday afternoon).
Overall excellent park and I will return :)
