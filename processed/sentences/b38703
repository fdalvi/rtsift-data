I'm so happy that Hal has found a home!
Love the food.
Love the new and improved Margaritas.
Yum Yum, all around!

Just as wonderful as ever.
All the familiar smiling faces.
Same great food

Great food overall!!!
Only bad thing is it's expensive for the amount of food you get

Let me start off with: THE NAME IS HILARIOUS!
Haha  The decor is kind of run down.
Chipped paint.
Old tables.
They need a paint job.
Food- Good.
I got the sampler.
It had tostadas, a tamale, chicken chimichangas, beef chimichangas, beef tacos, beans, and rice.
-The green tamale had too much manteca (lard), not enough flavor.
-The tostadas were okay.
-the beef tacos were good.
-the rice was good.
-the beans: blegh.
Flavorless.
-the best thing on that plate were the chimichangas!
Yummers!
They give you endless chips and salsa and that's great!
I just wish the salsa was spicier and wasn't pure tomato.
Service was good, but they kind of took a long time.
I love the music!
Affordable prices.
Cute place but not my first choice.

This place is magic!
Their salsa is out of this world, and their margaritas are stellar!
The service is awesome as well.
We love Tony, he is always on top of refilling our drinks, and refreshing our chip basket!
Try their cheese enchilada comb, you won't regret it!

I have eaten here a few times how ever tonight was not the best.
I ordered a bean burrito and the beans tasted spoiled sour.
