You will not find better technicians for high end or vintage audio repair in Vegas or the Southwest US in my opinion.
I will not take my McIntosh anywhere else.

I was looking for a place to bring my electronics for repair.
Because of the good reviews here I decided to call this place.
Some young pumk answers the phone like he's ready to kill someone.
I could not even get my question out without him acting like a smart a$$ and continually interrupting me.
When I tried to ask him my question a third time, he hung up on me!
Simply unbelievable that this place can even be in business.
If they don't even have patience to hear a potential customer out so they they can answer a question properly, what do you think they will do to your electronics?
Hence, I would stay away from this place at all costs!!!!
And, we live in both LV as well as LA in case you're wondering.

A friend recommended this place to me awhile ago and since then I come here for all my audio equipment needs.
The technicians are super helpful and informative.
They answer all my questions and the cost is affordable.
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone needing audio repair work done.
This is seriously the best repair shop in Vegas and they carry vintage to new audio equipment for sale!
5 stars for excellent service!
