Lazy staff, call lights stay on for hours.
The nurses who took care of my father could care less about the patients and more about standing around speaking in a foreign language.
I complained to the director of nursing, she didn't appear to care.
It's a horrible place with roaches crawling all over during the night.
Do not put anyone you care for in this dump.
If I could give 0 stars I would.

DO NOT ADMIT here!
I give this place zero stars.
My Father in law was sent to this place via the hospital after his stroke.
It was filthy, loud, unorganized and each person has to stay two in a room.
I could go on, but I suggest if you are in the Las Vegas area to check out Caremeridien, and completely avoid this facility.

My dad unfortunately is sent to this unprofessional place every time he is discharged from centennial hills hospital.
His cell phone was stolen from a CNA who was admitting him.
Supervisor did not do anything about it; Nurses and CNA's do not pay fully attention to their patients.
Every time my husband & I go into visit my dad, there is always patients yelling for help and no one runs into their room.
Staff is so irresponsible that a nurse placed my dads antibiotic thru ivy and did not realize it wasn't in the vein, my dad noticed his arm was very swollen and the nurse went in 2 hours after my dad had pressed the help button.
Therapy is a plus.
The housekeepers help my dad more then the staff.
I hate this place.
never admit your family members in this facility.
