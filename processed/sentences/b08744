My gas tank was nearing empty and I had to fill up before I got stranded on the side of the road.
This was the closest gas station, so I pulled in.
The price of gas has really gone up!
$4.09/gal?!

Typical " gas & go" Shell station.
Very small island store/cashier station with a nice attendent believe it or not!
Very conveniently located on the corner of Thomas and Hayden

I was a paying customer and had to use the bathroom, live in the neighborhood and am in there all the time.
The owner wouldn't let me use the bathroom!
He said I could use the one at sonic, where the other low life's go.
Now I drive a 2008 Volkswagen gti, so clearly he knows I'm not a low life.
