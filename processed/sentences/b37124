Even though I'm giving 5 stars, recently when a young dark haired guy has been working, he would be stocking shelves or maintaining drink dispensaries, and there will be a line of 2-3 people at the unmanned check out registers.
I find this very unusual.
He was also not that friendly.
I hope management reads this and makes some improvements regarding customer service at this store.

This QT is big, clean, spacious, with great stock and really easy to get from/to the highway.
Hard to know it's even here if you're on the highway, but it's one of the most convenient gas/stores on this stretch of SR-101.
Always fast service too.

Great location w/prepared hot food & shakes.
Very busy as it is convienciwnt lay located off of the 101, this also explains why the bathrooms are ok sometimes.
