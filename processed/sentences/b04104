I used to eat at the lone Baja Fresh in Raleigh, NC before it closed, so I was excited to finally be able to eat some of their fish tacos once again.
They were as good as I remembered them being too!
I got a grilled and a crispy fish taco.
Both were good, but the grilled was probably the better of the two.
The atmosphere is pretty standard fast food style with fairly plain decor, but don't let that make you think the food isn't worth it.
The service was friendly and the food came out quickly.

The food is good, I usually go for the ultimo burrito.
They have a nice fresh salsa bar with peppers and limes.
They also give you a bag of chips to snack on with your food, which is nice while you wait for them to make your food.

I use to come here once in awhile before my work moved to a different office.
Main reason being, their chips and salsa!
The baja salsa is great!
Food wise, the tacos are okay.
Service is always great.

My coworker and I stopped there got lunch yesterday.
The food tasted great but that night we were both sick to our stomachs.
Another coworker saw our food and went there w her kids later that evening and also got sick.
Her son found a geico in the bathroom!!

I haven't eaten at a Baja Fresh in probably 3 years.
My coworker so graciously sprang for lunch the other day, in celebration of my engagement, yay!
Their food is always consistent and yummy!
I had the grilled veggie burrito, same thing I used to get back in the day.
Very tasty!
She got the Grilled Shrimp Salad, she was very excited about it so I am going to assume it was awesome!
There was a huge line but they got threw everyone quickly and my food didn't take to long.
It is a big of a drive from the office but I think it might be worth adding it to the lunch time rotation!

closed?
Sign on the door says the landlord seized everything.
