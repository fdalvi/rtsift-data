Convenient location and great service for purchasing Korean food.

We checked this store out after we got back from Japan.
We wanted to find some specific ingredients.
The proprietor was downright rude to us and unpleasant, as if she did not want us in the store since we were not regular customers.
Maybe she was just in a terrible mood or something, but we will never go back,

I am easygoing and generally do not give negative ratings (see my rating distribution!
) BUT this is an exception.
The owner is extremely rude during my few visits to their shop.
They did not greet, nor did they say anything when we pay them.
He treated me as if I owed them money!
Incredible that the business can sustain for so many years.
I stopped going to this place after the unpleasant experience.
If you want to shop for Korean food, go to Park St.
If you're looking for general pan-Asian selection, there are many better places in town.

Really enjoy this store's selection of Korean and Japanese goods!
Conveniently located!
It's a bit pricey for some food items but definitely worth the price if you're looking for quality Asian ingredients here in Madison.
Also chopsticks were pretty affordable.
