I want to paint my bedroom.
I found a color I thought might work and as luck would have it my local Ace Hardware was the place for it.
So I dropped in there this morning thinking I would purchase a sample size to see how the color looked on the wall.
The guy who was providing me customer service informed me "we don't give samples".
I explained I was expecting to pay for a sample, not be given one and his response was buy a quart or nothing.
No sample sizes for paint.
No wonder Ace Hardware stores are struggling to survive.
Who buys paint without a sample first?
I mean, Home Depot, Lowes, Sherman Williams, they all have sample sizes.
And they all have better customer service.

This place is great they always seem to have the stuff home de pot doesn't.
I have had great experiences with the staff, they are very helpful and knowledgable.
They have saved me tons on plumbing repairs and yard machinery repairs.

This Ace Hardware Store has everything you need with great selections and prices.
Friendly employees and you are in and out.
Ace Hardware Yay!
I'm a fan.
