Awesome Event!
I first attended years ago.
The lessons I learned inspired me and completely changed the life path I was on.
I'm eternally grateful!

The Success Combination Seminar brought to light several decisions that I made about myself a long time ago, that were limiting my success in the present.
It also gave me an opportunity to change these decisions which clearly made a difference in my personal and professional life.
I highly recommend the seminar.

My name is Jay Sordean.
For the past 30 years I have been doing natural medicine -- acupuncture, herbs, homeopathy, hypnotherapy, NRCT - and am constantly learning more.
Mark Yuzuik's course is a definite must for even experienced hypnotherapists.
His take on the technique and science is solid and quickly applicable to the clinical setting.
Mark is also a great guy and very approachable.
I recommend the series of CDs, which I personally listen to and have my patients listen to as well while lying with acupuncture needles in.
(www.TheRedwoodClinic.com)  Mark's  Spanish series is a god-send as I have been looking for decades for such good work.
Thanks Mark!
