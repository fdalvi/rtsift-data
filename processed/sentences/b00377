I stayed at the Hotel San Carlos and they are partnered with this gym.
It's a block away from the hotel.
Well equipt gym.
I was able to have an excellent workout.

nothing flashy - just a comfortable fitness environment with generally well maintained equipment and facilities.

Love this gym.
Very casual and comfortable and the locker rooms are well maintained and tidy.
A great way to spend my lunch hour.
