Good.
Glad they opened one here.
Now I can get breakfast burrito and walk over to Starbucks for coffee on way to work

The only way this place could get better is with a drive thru!
Standard Don Tortaco/Robertos food.
Greasy, cheesy, fattening goodness.
They girl up front even remembers our usual order.
Maybe we go their too often...
It is clean, fresh, yummy, friendly, cheap.
What could be better?

Breakfast burrito has shrunk.
Loved them before perfect size but I think the tortilla is more of the burrito than the egg, bacon, cheese and potatoe now.
I was a extreme regular.
Might be done.

Not bad.
It's under new management and owners.
Fresh food and goes head to head with Laurita's.
I'll give more details but they are open for business.

Always clean, friendly staff that remembers us and always gets the order correct and prompt!

My cheese enchilada was cold.
And the cheese weren't even melted.
And the sauce they use here for the enchilada tasted like ravioli sauce.
Other than that its very quiet here.
