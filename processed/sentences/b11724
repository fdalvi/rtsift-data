LOVE this store!!
I don't usually buy more than I need but the clearance here is amazing.
I STILL wear what I bought from years ago - its that good!!
I had a question about a sweater I purchased and I have to say the sales lady was very acccomodating and helpful.
Just a nice vibe in the store - its upscale and FRIENDLY which is nice!!
I also have to say that when I purchased sale items (as well a regular priced skirt) they took the same care with the clearance items in wrapping them as the regular priced skirt which is just totally classy :)   The accessories are nicely priced and match my new sweaters perfectly!
Its also nice thats its off the heathen "strip" and all the madness!!
I just loved this store and I'll be back !!!
If you are looking for anything this is the place to go!!
Timeless pieces that are NOT stodgy or "elderly looking" just classy SEXY clothes that are age appropriate that fit nicely!!
LOVE this store and its great service!

Ann Taylor is a great store to get work clothes, but in this store, the salespeople are AWESOME!!
I went in to buy a gift for my mom for her birthday and the lady didn't have the item in the store, so she ordered it from another store and had it delivered as a gift to my mom's house.
When I found out 2 days later the item has gone on sale and was 40% cheaper, I called the lady back and she said she'd price adjust my gift to reflect the new deal.
How awesome is that?!
Just for that reason, I will frequent this particular location!

Ann Taylor is one of my favorite clothing shops for work attire.
I have purchased many of their suits and lots of their sweaters and tops and they've really held up over the years.
I don't wear suits very often these days but I've still managed to find tops and accessories here and this recent trip in Vegas was no exception.
I picked up a long sleeve canary yellow sweater (http://www.anntaylor.com/ann/product/product%3A292080/AT-MHL-Graphic-Black-%26-White/Spring-Cardigan/292080?colorExplode=false&skuId=13384692&catid=cat1270002&productPageType=search&defaultColor=3221) that I saw in the window and had to have it.
Unfortunately, my husband didn't really care for it so it'll be going back.
boo hoo.
In addition, picked up a really light weight scarf (http://www.anntaylor.com/ann/product/AT-Accessories/AT-View-All/Pen-and-Ink-Paisley-Scarf/300682?colorExplode=false&skuId=13218638&catid=cata000025&productPageType=search&defaultColor=9192)  that I could wear in San Diego - even during the summer months.
I've actually already worn it and I love the way it feels against my skin and it's the perfect accessory for any outfit.
I'm so glad I purchased as it will be getting lots of use this season.
I also picked up a lightweight blouse (http://www.anntaylor.com/ann/product/AT-Petites/AT-Petite-Blouses-Tops/Petite-Paisley-Brocade-Blouse/302152?colorExplode=false&skuId=13381806&catid=cata000026&productPageType=search&defaultColor=3221) in the same pattern as the scarf I purchased.
It won't be worn together but on their own, they're great!
It's a super comfy blouse that can be dressed up or down.
I usually don't buy things in the same patterns but I couldn't pass either of them up.
Thanks Ann Taylor for the successful shopping trip!

Ann Taylor is where I usually purchase my professional attire.
While they do tend to be a bit expensive for my budget, they often have sales and send email coupons which make their items more affordable.
The store is well organized, bright, the dressing rooms are sizable and clean.
While their employees aren't always the most friendly, they will assist you upon request, and are always professional.
I appreciate that they take the time to their neatly fold your clothes and wrap them in tissue paper, or leave them hanging.
Most of the time, they'll ask which you prefer.
They also will walk around the counter to personally hand you your bag, which is also a very nice touch.
