It's always a little dicey when you hire a plumber.
Luckily, I found Josh of Leak Doctor Plumbing to be a professional and courteous fella.
We needed the main shutoff valve replaced at our house.
Josh was able to come out next day (on a Saturday, at no extra cost) to do the work in less than an hour.
He explained exactly what he was going to do and gave us the parts/labor cost breakdown.
He replaced the valve & pipe, just what we needed.
Now no more leaking!
He's licensed, bonded, and insured and also quoted us the lowest rate amongst 4 other pros we called.
Good contractor & I'd definitely use him again to cure our plumbing woes.

Super friendly.
No BS.
No attempt to talk anyone into getting something they didn't need.
Very refreshing!
I would definitely call this company again - but there probably won't be a need to, since he fixed all of our leaking issues.
Thanks!

We are so very pleased with the service we received from Josh.
He is polite, courteous, prompt, and didn't feel sale-sy at all.
He fixed our leak quickly, and it ended up costing less than what the deductible would have been through our homeowner's insurance, so we didn't have to make a claim.
I will definitely use him again (if the need should arise - but let's hope not!
) and refer him to friends and family.
Thanks for the excellent service, Josh!
