the best gas station in the world!
they have Ruster buster light

Starbucks watch your back...QT clerks are competing with you for friendly service at the crack of dawn.
Everyone in QT is so friendly.
Their prices for gas are usually pretty competitive and everyone knows they have a great drink selection.

I don't go to Phoenix often but when I do, I prefer Quik Trip.
My friend and I were leaving town headed home when we came across this one off the freeway, and being a big fan of the QT we were relieved to see it!
Refreshing cold purified soda was soon in hand as well as their locally baked cookies (with little M & M type candy in them!
) and sandwiches galore.
I will avoid the other competitors like the plague when I am in a town with a QT because I trust this place and love the selection and quality.
I love how each store is laid out practically the same and bathrooms are clean and always a welcome site, and so easy to find.
No fussing around for a key.

Quick in and out.
Soda's any size 79Â¢ always.
gas is reasonably priced at this location.
kids working the counter are always very polite and eager to help.

HOOD!
HOOD!
HOOD!
customers are super scary.
Staff was great.

As far as a gas station/ convenience store QT is as good as it gets.
No matter which store that I go to, it's always clean!!!
Can't say that about too many other gas stations.
Also a huge plus, is that the bathrooms are always clean!!
QT is the only option for dropping deuces, when you have to go and not home!

This has been my GO-TO station since I moved back to the Phoenix area.
Always been satisfied with prices, service, and cleanliness of the station.
Always felt safe when I've been filling my car.
Well, NOT anymore.
A couple weeks ago I was hit up by a guy wanting $$ for gas.
"Can you spare some money?
I don't have enough and I need gas.
"  So .
I just thought it was a guy down on his luck.
Not the usual sort I meet when I am pumping gas.
But, hey, OK, I get it.
But that little nagging last line "thanks Ma'am" made me wonder.
But I brushed it aside.
It was the middle of the day and, yes, I was definitely older and I could spare a dollar or two.
Well, then yesterday I stopped for a fill-up again.
Yep, you guessed it!
Another guy .
not the same one asked for gas money so he could get home.
Well now, twice in broad daylight in a short period of time appears to me to be the beginnings of a pattern.
A rather uncomfortable one.
This is Tempe, not downtown Chicago, or San Francisco.
Both were guys in their 20s.
Neither looked homeless, but neither were in tuxedos either.
I want to feel safe where I get gas, or shop, or dine.
There are lots of choices.
And so, even though this station was convenient .
I shall take my business elsewhere.
Always be aware of your surroundings and be cautious.
Most folks out there mean no harm; but there are occasionally the ones that do.

Quick Trip is a great chain of gas stations.
It's one of those gas station stores  where you don't have to fear entering after filling with gas.
Heck you can come here without getting gas.
They got food, drink, other stuff and it's cheap.
They greet everyone that enters, and they are QUICK with the purchase transations -  hence the name.
Today they were handing out free sandwiches at this location.

First and only visit to a QT.
The young lady at the register greeted me as I walked in.
Nice.
Very clean for a convenience store.
I just don't agree with the buy 2 drinks for $3.30, but get 1 for $2.
I see it here, in Indiana and every where I've traveled.
Attentive service for the 5 minutes I was there.
