Hookahs are the draw here.
The food is mediocre and the atmosphere quite blah.
If smoking sheesha is your thing, there aren't many old town Scottsdale options so this may be your place.
My bud ordered lamb tongue and was pretty happy with it.
I didn't have the balls to try it, but if you do you may be in for a pleasant adventure.

We were confronted yesterday with a very typical circumstance: on one side of the road was My Big Fat Greek Restaurant, and on the other, a small, independent Kebab shop.
We rolled the dice and went with the previously unknown and unrecommended Kebab shop.
Bad move.
First off, the bread they brought us was disappointing to say the least.
Next to that, the chicken dish I ordered was slow out of the kitchen and mediocre at best.
More importantly, though, was the general uncomfortable vibe we were marinating in throughout the course of our lunch.
The owners/managers spoke in obnoxious tones to their staff and something about the place in general gave us the heebie jeebies.
When our waitress finally returned with our check, we were already halfway out the door.

The food has improved since I have been here and the staff was pleasant.
I think they are working on trying to improve its atmosphere but they still have a way to go
