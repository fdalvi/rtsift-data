Great Taco Bell.
They always ask a couple of times if you want sauce, and I've never NEVER had my order messed up here.
That can't be said for a lot of other fast food places nowadays.

Quick service, excellent value for money.

Dining Room closed at 10PM on a Friday ?
Are you kidding me ?
My four year old son and I ended up having to eat our meal in my truck because the dining room was closed.
Anyways, the food is always fresh.
Reasonably priced.
Employees are competent and happy.
I have had no bad experience here.

They love to get my order wrong.

Tuesday at 5 pm .
1) No a.c. in building 2 fans set up for ventilation 2) Not good food and sorta luke warm  3) Bathrooms smell like raw sewage !!!
It is very sad that a company makes 500 million a year and the CEO of the company makes 40 million a year but there resteraunts that have hard working employees at minimum wage must suffer ... so sad that this can be legal   ( I work for Fire safety and am in fast food and resteraunts almost all day long and no this is not just one occurrence , stuff never gets fixed )   SO SAD
