What a great experience I just had at Firestone.
Went there for a second opinion after going to the local Jeep dealer.
After checking all the same of items Jeep cheeked, I was advised that 2 of them didn't need to be done and the other 2 items were done for literally half the price of the Jeep dealer.
One of them was an alignment.
These guys get my future business for all my maintenance needs.
Joe was great and Christian was helpful too.
Thanks guys!

If I could give less than one star, I would.
Brought my F150 in for misfire.
They diagnosed it and told me one cylinder is dead and I need a new engine after checking vacuum.
I asked if the could email me the test results, they told me they don't have email capabilities.
I asked for results of compression test, cylinder leak down, as well as fuel pressure readings and they told me they couldn't do that.
